    "In this study, we started by collecting data by using a Crawling API to scrape data from Amazon's search results pages. Here's a breakdown of how it goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initializes a list called search_terms which likely contains the search terms to be used on Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It sets up parameters such as page limit, starting page number, and folder structure for storing extracted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It loops through each search term and constructs the Amazon search URL for that term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It defines a function get_reviews(url) to scrape individual product pages for more detailed information such as reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It defines a function scrape_url(url) to scrape data from the Amazon search result pages. This function also calls get_reviews(url) to extract more detailed information for each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It starts crawling by calling scrape_url(amazon_search_url) for the initial search page. If there are multiple pages of search results, it iterates through them, calling scrape_url(page_url) for each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. It writes log files containing information about the crawling process. It converts the scraped data into a DataFrame using Pandas and saves it to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : CrawlingAPI link[https://api.crawlbase.com/scraper?token={js_token}&url=] Integration utilizing a Crawling API, which abstracts away the complexity of making HTTP requests and handling responses. This allows the script to focus on parsing the data from Amazon's search result pages rather than dealing with network interactions.\n",
