Screws sticking out in 8 places on each individual side panel to the point where the entire cabinet has shards of wood popping out. Tried to return and they are saying I have to pay for shipping when it\u2019s their fault!! It would crack and collapse if I tried to assemble it and displayed ANYTHING on it! So furious!!",

The cabinet unfortunately arrived damaged due to FedEx handling but I contacted the seller and they promptly provided options and sent us a new cabinet and did not ask us to pay for shipping or return the damaged. Easy to put together with a drill. Overall great quality for the price. Would recommend.",

There was one chip on the partial board but luckily it is not visible. If small children are in the house, I would recommend anchoring to the wall as it is not real stable. However, that is not an issue for me. I think it is a very cute and am happy with the way it looks!",

I love the soft-close doors and the way the backing is made (nicer finished look than most similar furniture). I plan to purchase a second one.",
