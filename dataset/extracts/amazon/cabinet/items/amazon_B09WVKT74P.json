The only screws that required a GREAT deal of elbow grease were the ones used to attach the doors. Otherwise, things went smoothly and it was done in about an hour. It looks great and the quality for the money is impressive. I will note that if you're very sensitive to smells, this does have a strong factory odor that lingers for about a week. If that sounds awful, pop the box open in an empty room and let it air out for a few days before you tackle it. It's been just a few weeks, but I love this little fella.",

                "reviewText": "Original 2* review (posted 12/9/2022)-Since the pros list is shorter, I'll start with that...it was easy to put together. I am a fairly handy woman and usually put furniture together by myself... if I ever have to ask for my husband's help the item is either to heavy, awkward, or a nightmare to assemble; I didn't need to ask for his help in this case, it was incredibly simple.There's one neutral, it looks cheap, but I don't have it in the open so looks weren't that important to me.The cons... this is a BIG one! It is incredibly flimsy, I doubt it will last a year, I'm actually afraid to put cleaning supplies in it because it doesn't feel like it will be able to take any weight. I put the cleaning supplies on the very bottom self only, the other shelves are towels and sheets. The quality is terrible. I knew it wasn't going to be top of the line, I expected it, but I didn't expect it to be THIS bad... my cats have had corrugated cardboard scratch furniture that seems as sturdy as this. This should be priced MUCH lower, I would say $50 would be reasonable. I cannot recommend this to anyone, I would say find something of similar quality that is priced reasonably, or look for something the same price but much better quality, or pay $100 more and buy the solid wood furniture that's made in Vietnam, looks nice and should last for years (I bought both this and the solid wood furniture around the same time and was very impressed with the quality...I can't remember the name of that furniture, but will be leaving a review on it after this).Edited review 1/7/2023:I have to give major props to this company! THEY initiated contact to rectify my issues with their product 4 days ago (I never contacted them, all I did was write the review above). They offered either a replacement or a refund. I didn't see the email until today, so they ended up initiating a refund. I am incredibly impressed with their level of customer service!",

More than enough storage for our foyer 1/2 bathroom. I am one of the most mechanically challenged people on the planet, took me a few hours to assemble, instructions are clear and easy to understand. My issue was me - figuring out best way to line up the holes for the door hinges and getting the screws in there while holding the door(s) up. Very good looking cabinet for the price and materials, just keep it dry!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this cabinet for a powder bathroom remodel to give some storage since it only has a pedestal sink. The cabinet looked cute in the pics and was in the budget I wanted to spend so I bought it. When it came, it was packed nicely and none of the pieces were damaged. The instructions were easy to read and follow although it is a picture diagram only with no words so make sure you do not miss any steps.So onto the actual building. The screws do not fit the holes properly and more than one would not lay flush especially when dealing with the hinges and the doors. The walls and top of the cabinet are held together with just a metal pin and a circular object that fits in a hole and spins around the pin to \u201clock\u201d it into place however they do not lock it tight and the whole cabinet is wobbly due to the amount of play in it. The doors as mentioned earlier do on hang properly due to the screws not fitting flush in the holes leaving them wobbly as well. The doors are also held shut with just a strip of metal with a screw in the middle and a magnet and again, the screws would not lay flush and the metal closure tab spins making it impossible to close without adjusting every single time. That combined with crooked doors due to the improper fit screws, and you spend more time adjusting it than anyone should to open or close a single door.All over, this is a hot mess. It\u2019s not sturdy and will not hold up over time. In fact, I\u2019m afraid to even place a potted plant on it for fear it could fall if someone opens the doors with it on top. It\u2019s that poorly made. If you are looking for something that will last awhile, this is just not it. I was tempted several times during building to just chuck it in the bin and not even try to finish it. It\u2019s not worth the time or effort put into it and I\u2019m still going to have to buy something else so it was a complete waste of money.",
