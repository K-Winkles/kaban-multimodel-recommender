                "reviewText": "We purchased this cabinet to provide a little more storage space in our guest bathroom and it turned out to be just right. This is obviously not expensive furniture. It is a good looking, inexpensive solution. For anyone who has experience assembling Ikea type furniture, and if you follow the illustrated directions VERY carefully, assembly is not difficult. For others, it might be best to get the help of a handyman. I was able to put the cabinet together in about an hour and a half with only a couple of minor mistakes that I had to go back and re-do. Each part is clearly marked and I could have avoided my mistakes by paying just a little more attention! In my case, I may be too experienced, so I got careless! When assembling, be careful not to over tighten anything and you'll wind up with a decent, sturdy cabinet. All the parts fit together perfectly, as well.",

                "reviewText": "So far it's great. I changed the knobs to match our existing bathroom vanity knobs but the ones that came with it were good quality as well. I ended up using the screws that came with it for the knobs still (because the screws that came with my square one were too long). Everything went together smoothly and lined up. I personally am not a fan of the cam lock fastening system, especially for furniture, but these one fit nice and tight in the holes and actually grip lock around the screw. The whole cabinet assembled is kind of wobbly (lightweight) when you open and close the drawer and it does come with a wall anchor system, which I'm sure works fine, but I clean too often and move stuff around to have this particular little stand anchored down. I just got it for somewhere to have the toilet paper and such nearby and it matches the larger storage cabinet that I have coming for in the bathroom as well so it was really a win win all around.The only things I noticed wrong was what looked like a crack that was painted over during manufacturing. There's no blemishes anywhere else so I think it may just be part of the last later of wood (or whatever it is it's made of) that peeled up in the factory before it was painted. It didn't effect the use of it at all and honestly I had to really look for it when I went back to take a picture of it. Also, the little magnet on the door could be just a little bit stronger, I get the bigger rolls of toilet paper and had to stack them (as pictured) to get the magnet to think about holding the door closed. It would fit 4 stacks of 3 high per shelf if the magnets were stronger.It arrived a day early and was worth the money I'd say. It does look nice and a bit bigger I guess than I expected, which isn't a bad thing. It fits nicely between the door and the toilet without being in the way.",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews and I NEVER put together furniture so this is a testament to this product. I am a 68 y/o woman with no carpentry skills. My DH always took care of these projects but he is currently incapacitated. We needed a small cabinet to add storage in the bathroom and the dimensions on this one fit the bill. Knowing I would have to put it together, before ordering I went through the listing till I found the manual and I read through the whole thing. Here is what makes this item easy to put together: each piece is tagged with a letter. Each piece of hardware is marked with a letter. The manual is pictures only. No written instructions. But it shows you which piece to put where and how to use each piece of hardware. Technically the only tool needed is a phillips head screwdriver. I needed a small set of pliers to facilitate turning screws as I have alot of arthritis in my hands. Everything went in fine, to my amazement. It took me awhile because I dragged my feet but basically the directions were easy to follow and everything was there. It is actually pretty sturdy, good looking and will hold tons of toilet paper. I highly recommend the product and I would assume any cabinet put out by these people would be just as easy to put together. PS: I did have another cabinet put together by my husband years ago to look at as reference for things like which way do the hinges go, etc.",
