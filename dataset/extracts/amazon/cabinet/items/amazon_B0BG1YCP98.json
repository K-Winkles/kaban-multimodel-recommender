I love that the shelves are adjustable and they seem fairly sturdy. The things I do not like: it took two pretty knowledgable guys over 2 hours to assemble. The instructions were just a little hard to follow. The quality is OK but I'm not sure how many moves this piece of furniture will have in it. The back is very thin plywood. The drawer works fairly well. I paid $299 for the unit I guess overall it was an OK buy- I just wish it felt a little more sturdy for when we have to move houses.",
