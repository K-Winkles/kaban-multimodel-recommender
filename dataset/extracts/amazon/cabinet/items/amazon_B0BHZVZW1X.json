Backing has annoying stickers that tear when attempting to peel off. No screw holes for the backing either, so be careful or else the screw will go in at an angle and break through the wood (see one of the pics, oops!). Hinges pictured in the manual are different that the ones included, have a problem with the left door being too low and scrapping as it shuts but the directions to pull the door up does nothing. Unsure what to do about that for now. The handles are uneven as a result.As far as the size of it, well I wish it was deeper. Shelves have a depth of 10.5 inches which I find slightly too shallow for my towels unless I fold them over again which just wastes more space vertically. My only major complaint really.",
