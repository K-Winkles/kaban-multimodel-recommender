The extra space is a plus for storing bath treats. Looks great in our bathroom. Only downside, I am not too fond of the plastic style tracks for the bottom three drawers, but otherwise the product was exactly what we wanted.Also to note. The instructions were kinda all over the place in my opinion. There was no real flow to it. It had you prep all the pieces first, even ones you wouldn\u2019t be using until the last couple pages, before building. Since I built in bathroom, I ran out if space super quick! Otherwise the instructions are easy to follow, they just need reorganized to flow better.",

                "reviewText": "I received the cabinet in a timely manner, on the day it was scheduled to arrive. It came in a box that was very secure and inside materials were well protected. I found no damage to materials when unpacking.I spent time at the outset while unpacking, checking off the parts list, making sure I had everything I was supposed to have before starting. I would suggest also doing this. No sense beginning unless every part is accounted for. Every part was here and well labeled.Be aware that there are quite a lot of pieces and parts and the assembly is involved.The instructions are pictures only with no written description, other than the a-z labels. Just make sure you follow each step slowly and correctly and everything goes fine.I assembled the unit myself, without help. It took about 3 hours and I had no problems. Everything matched up and fit together perfectly. And there were no flaws in the materials.I'm very pleased with the cabinet. We are using it in our hallway to store bathroom toiletries and supplies.My only complaint is the dimensions depicted. The 3 sliding stacked drawers are shown as 9\" tall. Wrong. They are actually only 7\" tall. And although there are 2 shelves in the cupboard, only 1 of them is adjustable. That was a slight disappointment. Other than that, it's a very nice looking and sturdy utility cabinet, for the money. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "First, note that this has a LOT of pieces to assemble. If you've assembled any pre-fab furniture, it shouldn't be too bad. One piece of advice I have is to organize all the little bags of hardware (screws, brackets, dowels, etc.) before you start. You jump around a bit from using the items in bags A, B, C to then F, G, S, then D, then U, V, C. Nice to have them all laid out so you're not hunting around for them.All in all, fairly straightforward assembly and the instructions were generally clear. There were really only two minor issues for me with the assembly of this piece.One is that one of the doors was a bit misaligned. No matter what I did, it was slightly crooked. It wasn't to the point that it would catch/rub and look terribly obvious, but it was definitely slightly off angle.The other is that the holes to screw in the magnet were off center so it was barely touching the metal plate on one of the doors. I had to drill new holes to move it over about 1/2 inch so it would be more centered.It's definitely not solid wood if that's what you're looking for, but otherwise a good solid piece.",
