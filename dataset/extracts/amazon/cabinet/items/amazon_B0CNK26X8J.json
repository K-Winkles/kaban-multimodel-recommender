                "reviewText": "I've put together a few assemble-it-yourself products over the years, but this one is built with amazing precision. Everything fits together perfectly and the joints are all dead-on. The unit is not stable on its own and really should be attached to a wall using the provided hardware, but that's not a design problem; it's just tall and narrow, which is why is works so well in the space it is being using in. It is made inexpensively using pressed wood, which has a pretty thin coating of paint on it, so it is easy to blemish if you aren't careful while using the provided screwdriver to assemble it, but I got it together without any noticeable dings. For the price, I am very happy with this purchase. I will be curious to see how long it lasts. I didn't buy it thinking that I would be handing it down as a family heirloom, but it looks great today.",

                "reviewText": "Our master bath does not have a linen closet. We needed something small, but spacious to hold excess toiletries, towels, toilet paper, etc. This cabinet does that for a great price.Our only complaint is that the top doors do not align perfectly because the pilot holes were slightly off. No one will notice except us, but we found ourselves wishing for adjustable hinges.One person can easily assemble. I recommend leaving off the door knobs until you are finished because I had to lay the cabinet on the floor to screw in the back panels. Instructions said 60min assembly. It took me longer than that, probably closer to 120mins. If there were two of you, assembly will go faster.Lastly, secure it to the wall. The magnets are strong and you could easily pull it on yourself if you tug too hard on a door.",

                "reviewText": "I generally don't go for boxed furniture that I have to assemble. Mainly, it is because the furniture tends to be of the poor quality of the materials used. I am really very impressed by this cabinet. First of all, the assembly was so easy. I did it myself in a single afternoon. The parts fit together correctly, and there were no missing pieces. The second positive is the materials that make up this cabinet are superior to many flat-pack furniture. The wood used doesn't swell if exposed to moisture, like in a bathroom or laundry room application. You would think that furniture designed to be in a bathroom would be like this, but I have had more than one piece of furniture swell and disintegrate that was specifically made for the bathroom.The wood featured in this product doesn't do that, and the finish doesn't scratch very easily. The next great thing about this cabinet is that it is surprisingly roomy. I can see using this in the pantry, in a craft room, bathroom, hallway, just about anywhere really. The cabinet can actually be treated as furniture instead of furniture eye-sores that are an embarrassment and end up in a dark basement or garage. Lastly, this furniture has a design that maximizes the vertical space it creates while not having a big footprint. This is a solid piece of furniture that I am happy to have ordered.",
