                "reviewText": "Assembly was pretty straightforward. The major problem is the sloppy rails with pre drilled holes off by around 1/4 inch. This prevented the slider from aligning evenly. Some homemade modifications fixed the alignment, but the rails are too small for the slider. Feels loose. Anyway it works for its purpose. Good luck. Overall 2 stars because of the pull out middle rack.",

                "reviewText": "These days it is very hard to find furniture that doesn't buckle and fall apart. This baby is heavy, took several hours to put together, but totally worth it. This is not the typical inexpensive stuff, the designer seems to have put some actual thought into it, and whoever the manufacturer is, they are doing a good job, not cutting corners. Hopefully they don't do as others over time, and will continue to build the same quality, because I do see myself buying more. It came with extra pieces (screws, dowels) in case some go missing over time, as we all know they usually do, lol! The rails on the doors are actual metal, so they are strong enough to keep heavy objects in. I still have 4 or 5 extra shelves that I can put in the unit, it would make the spaces shorter, but I like that you have the option to set it up for your specific needs. Only 1 small shelf was damaged, a little paint chipping, not at all a big deal, a liner would cover the imperfection. The center pull out is quite difficult to install the 1st time. It kept stopping 1/2 way when we tried to slide it in, we thought maybe a screw was stopping it, but you have to kind of slowly smack it, coaxing it further and further until it connects properly. It has reinforcements to add to the backing to keep it from diaconnecting and falling off as items pushing against it usually would. Those also really add extra sturdiness, helping to tighten things up making it feel like a higher quality piece, the way furniture used to be built. It does have quality wall anchors as well, but it seems to have a very solid base, it does not wobble and is perfectly leveled, so it may not be necessary unless your floor isn't level, like with high pile carpeting. I do wish they made it a bit taller, I purchased a second taller piece (with see through cabinets on top) from a different seller, that appears to be from the same manufacturer. But it is low profile in all ways, great for small rooms and small spaces. I honestly think it is sturdy enough to stack another on top if wanted. I don't think I have purchased anything within the last 10 years that has met my expectations like this piece has. I am so happy with this that I would legit redo my entire kitchen in these if they were the material suited for that. If you are on the fence about buying it because it is compressed wood, don't be, it is made very well, and perfect for small item storage in just about every room. My reviews are real, meaning I did not get any incentives or discounts like you see with a lot of things like this being sold on Amazon, and definitely not always so positive. I just barely put it together, but I do not see any actual cons in this purchase. I am already thinking I may want to buy more, maybe the whole line, right away for a solution to my business product storage because they are excellent for organizing and don't take up a lot of space. Bravo to the manufacturer!",

                "reviewText": "I started out looking for a linen closet for extra storage space in my tiny bathroom.Looked locally but just didn't see anything I wanted to bring home. While shopping here at Amazon, this pantry showed up in the suggestion section. Hmmm, lots of little stuff that always ends up in the back of the cupboard ... this suddenly made more sense - keeps things orderly and viewable!With everything laid out in numerical order, I spent about 6 hours (a few interruptions) and put it together myself! THE INSTRUCTIONS where clear, concise and easy to follow. THE HARDWARE was well pictured in individual bags and clearly labeled. I put everything together and left the doors for the very end thinking I'd need help - but by setting the door onto a double thickness of the cardboard box, it was actually the easiest set of doors to put on! Sis & I assembled 3 other cabinets in the past 2 months ... again - this was the easiest of them all! Has a nice clean finish. Love that arched inset and 2 tone handles - adds some style to what otherwise would be a boring cabinet.It wasn't all that hard to get the middle pull-out placed either. Just 1 suggestion on that: make sure you have the screws on the bottom FLUSH! I had to take it out and tighten 1 just a bit more so it would close that final inch! I was able to stash almost all DIY stuff in the side that shown with the open door. Extra body wash, hairbrushes & sprays are in the middle pull out with make-up, bar soap and miscellaneous odds & ends in the other door! It's working out so much better than I imagined! Unlike a pair of turn table style bookcases put together earlier this summer, every inch of the screws had to be screwed in. The bookcases, I realized I could push the screws in then finish with a couple turns of the screwdriver. So, I think it's safe to say that whatever the wood is made from - it's pretty solid in comparison. This pantry was a bit more than I was planning to spend but I'm very happy and feel it was worth it! Hope this helps!",
