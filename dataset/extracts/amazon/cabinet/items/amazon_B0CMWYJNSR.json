It was the magnetic strip that goes on the top corner of the doors. At that point in the assembly, it was not worth taking it apart to return it. It is very frustrating to have a part missing, however, I am glad it wasn't an important part. I will just have to buy some magnets to glue on myself. The back wall of the cabinet was thin cardboard with a coating to match the \"wood-looking boards\". Overall, it was overpriced for what the end product turned out to be.",

                "reviewText": "I had a space with very specific dimentions.dimensions. Finally found this piece and I liked the color.However, this was a pain in the rear to put together. Some of the pilot holes were shallow, and a lot of them chipped and shattered the surface when I put the screws in. I had used a manual screw driver to try and avoid this. Instead of one cardboard back piece, for some reason this comes with 2 and a black plastic middle peice to join them. This piece was about an inch longer than the backs and made the wood top impossible to install. Had to grind it down in order to finish assembly. Good thing it came with extra hardware, because one of their screws was malformed and unusable.Even going back and tightening everything down, this is still a bit wobbly. For my use, in the laundry room for a bit more storage, it's acceptable. I wouldn't plan to move this piece around, though!",

Very noticeable!***Update***I received a replacement cabinet for the first one that was cracked... SAME CRACK SAME PLACE! The difference was this time it is cracked on BOTH front side supports!You really honestly NEED TO STOP SELLING THIS at least until you can figure out how to ship it!Not only did the item come broken, it is made of cheap material. The doors do not sit straight and there's about a 1/4 inch gap between them.",
