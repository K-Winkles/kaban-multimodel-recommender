                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We recently brought this Huuger Buffet Cabinet with Storage into our home office, and let me tell you, it\u2019s been a purchase we are pleased with. As my husband made the transition to working from home, we found ourselves in need of a storage solution for his professional (and not-so-pretty \ud83d\ude05) book collection. This cabinet turned out to be the perfect match for our needs, and it didn\u2019t break the bank.STYLE THAT WOWS: What truly won us over is the delightful style and very decent quality of this cabinet. It\u2019s not just a functional piece; it\u2019s a lovely addition to our home office. The blend of natural finish and the charming rattan-decorated door surfaces adds a fresh, aesthetically pleasing vibe that seamlessly integrated with our office decor. Plus, those cabinet doors do the trick to hide away those not-so-pretty books. \ud83d\ude02AMPLE STORAGE SPACE: Speaking of storage, this cabinet offered more than enough room to meet our needs. With two rattan doors, an inner shelf, and a spacious top, it can house a variety of items. We even decided to place our printer on top of the shelf. Whether you need a bookshelf, kitchen buffet, storage cabinet, TV console, or even a bar cabinet, this beauty excels in both aesthetics and storage capacity.STURDY AND SECURE: We also appreciate the solid and secure construction of this cabinet. The four sturdy solid wood feet and the included anti-tip kit (which we didn\u2019t opt to install at this time, but it\u2019s great for households with little ones) provide peace of mind when it comes to stability.STRESS-FREE ASSEMBLY: Now, the assembly process might not be our strong suit, but this cabinet\u2019s instructions made it surprisingly straightforward. The instructions were clear, and while they said to allow for 2 hours, my husband got through it in about 1.5 hours, using just a screwdriver.In a nutshell, we can\u2019t recommend this cabinet enough. If you\u2019re on the hunt for a versatile and affordable storage solution that adds style and functionality to your space, look no further.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I had seen that somebody else said it took them six hours to assemble and I was pretty worried. It took me one hour to assemble the first one. I didn\u2019t time the second one so I don\u2019t know.I referred to this as either dollhouse furniture or cheap Airbnb furniture. I would be embarrassed if somebody put something away in this cabinet and saw how cheap it was. But I really like the way it looks. I bought two of them and put them side-by-side as a credenza in my dining room. I needed something cheap and quick and this fit the bill.Based upon the cheap and quick and looks good it gets five stars. But this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to stand up to a whole lot of use.The directions were logical and straightforward. And it came with a nice screwdriver!",

I\u2019ve been eying this piece for several months and saw it was on sale recently so took a chance and purchased 3 pieces. The package came well packed, the set up was easy, clear instructions, screwdriver included( a good quality one too!). The wood finish is smooth and well made. The only minus is the doors don\u2019t seem to shut all the way, I\u2019m hoping it will adjust after some use. I\u2019ve always loved the rattan look, so the three pieces together look so neat, natural organic look yet chic. I\u2019m so happy with the purchase and highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these cabinets and placed them side by side in my entryway.They are ultra stylish and it was easy to put together with 2 people. The first one took a little longer to put together, but once we got the hang of it, we built the second one in a jiffy!Considering the price of these cabinets, they are a great deal for what you get. The storage capacity in these is huge.I was looking for a shoe cabinet and I fit about 12-14 shoes in ONE cabinet alone. Some of the shoes I don't wear often are stacked on top of each other towards the back of the cabinet, and then I have 4 pairs in the very front that are not stacked.We had a little difficulty lining up the doors. They still function perfectly and open smoothly, but if you notice micro details like me, the fact that the doors don't line up perfectly might bother you. That is the only reason I took off one star.Overall, the quality and durability has been good thus far. The cabinet doors open smoothly and they have great storage capacity. I love the natural light wood color as well.",
