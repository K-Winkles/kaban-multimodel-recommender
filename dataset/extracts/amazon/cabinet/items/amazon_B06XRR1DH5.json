The first and most important thing I am going to mention about these small towel racks is to use the sticky strips that came with the product. If you do not use them to secure your towel racks on your cabinet doors, they will slide all the time and it is very ANNOYING; unless if you don't mind...Okay, moving on... I just began to use these and I am very happy because they feel strong, they are cute, and they hold my hand towels in place. Some of my hand or kitchen towels are a little thick but I can still fit them nicely on the racks. I am using one rack in my bathroom and one in my kitchen. As you are drying your hands with your towel or after; make sure you leave the towel in place on the middle hanging on the rack so the towel won't slide.Sturdiness: Super sturdy only if you use the adhesive stripsAdhesion: the way it should adhereEasy to install: DefinitelyValue: GreatThese racks are very easy to install and as of yet I have not seen any rusting on them.Overall, this is a great, handy product that will leave you satisfied if installed and used properly. It is also a very good deal because you get 2 racks.",

                "reviewText": "As a self-proclaimed master of towel management, I was intrigued when I stumbled upon the Mosuch Stainless Steel Over Door Towel Rack Bar Holders. With a dash of skepticism and a sprinkle of excitement, I embarked on a mission to bring order to my chaotic towel collection.First impressions were promising. The stainless steel design exuded a sleek and modern vibe that blended seamlessly with my kitchen decor. Installing the rack was a breeze - simply hang it over the cabinet door, and voila! It seemed like the solution to all my towel-related woes had finally arrived.However, my optimism was soon met with a comical reality. You see, the universal fit claim seemed a tad ambitious. While the rack did fit over most of my cabinet doors, there were a few rebellious ones that simply refused to cooperate. I found myself engaging in a hilarious tug-of-war with the doors, desperately trying to make them accommodate the towel rack. It felt like a scene from a slapstick comedy.But let's not dwell on the setbacks; after all, laughter is the best medicine. Once I found doors that played nice, the rack did its job admirably. It held my towels securely, allowing them to air dry and saving precious counter space. The sturdy stainless steel construction ensured longevity, even with my not-so-gentle handling.The only downside worth mentioning is the limited capacity. With only two bars, it's suitable for smaller households or as an additional storage solution. If you're a towel enthusiast with an ever-expanding collection, you might need to look elsewhere.All in all, the Mosuch Over Door Towel Rack Bar Holders brought both order and laughter to my life. While the universal fit claim was a bit exaggerated and the capacity left something to be desired, it served its purpose well. If you're ready for a towel management adventure and don't mind a few laughs along the way, give this rack a whirl. Just be prepared to put your door-opening skills to the test!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this because my other one broke after several months. Can't say that this one is much sturdier, perhaps a little bit. I like the fact that there's cushioning on the opposite side where you hang up then there's no cushioning on the top for the top of the cabinet door, so I cut a tiny pieces of the double sided tape they included (which I really didn't understand why because there are no directions) and added one to the top and one on the side hook for both cushioning and to keep it in place.It's smaller than the one I used to have but it still works fine. They give you two and I will be using the second one in my bathroom where there is no towel hook, so that was a plus.Hoping this doesn't break and several months as well so if it doesn't then I definitely would recommend (perhaps Jurgis will have instructions on what to do with the double sided tape lol).",
