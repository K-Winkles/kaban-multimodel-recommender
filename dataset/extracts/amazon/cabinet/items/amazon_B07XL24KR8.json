I didn't make any mistakes or have to redo anything, it just takes a long time. You have to carefully look at everything or you might make a mistake 2) the cabinet is actually quite a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but the dimensions are accurate so that's on me for not knowing this before I got it",

I told them nothing, just make sure to update the instructions for future buyer:I got another message that they did that and also refunded me some of the money from my purchase. I cant tell you how nice it is to see fantastic customer service.I will definitely buy from this seller again knowing that if I have an issue they will make it right. \ud83d\udc4dSo, it\u2019s pretty and looks nice at the end of the day.It came in like 60 pieces, definitely intimidating. The directions\u2026well. At first I was impressed. But then they were wrong and unclear in some parts and that matters SO MUCH.I ended up going right through the pressed board on the top because I pushed too hard. Easy thing to do. Luckily I fixed with some super glue.Some stuff I just didn\u2019t get. I did it but I feel like I worked for 2.5 hours and honestly, it could have been built better. Not super sturdy, drawers fall out due to lack of tracks.In fairness I built a lot of stuff on my own, without my husband. I\u2019m not bad at it; but this was definitely more complicated that I am used to. Regardless, it\u2019s done and pretty, but not super functional. In hindsight I wish I had just spent more and paid more attention to the complication of building it. It won\u2019t last long but serves the job for now.",

The size, shape, layout are exactly what I was looking for. The finish even coordinates well with my reclaimed wood furniture which I thought would never happen. It does have a boatload of pieces and there are a couple places the instructions could have been a tad clearer but I don\u2019t even care because I\u2019m just so pleased with it. Of course I\u2019d prefer something that is solid wood but I didn\u2019t want to spend the money and honestly this is pretty well put together, even including braces for the back panel. I rarely see that in this kind of furniture. I agree that a screw gun is very helpful in places. The drawers definitely take some getting used to. This isn\u2019t something we will be getting in and out of every day so it\u2019s a non-issue for us. I hope it holds up okay.",
