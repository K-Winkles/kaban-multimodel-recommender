The corners are a little sharp, if you have any fall risks or fast moving kids, consider padding them with black or clear silicone corner protectors. For the inside size reference, I can stack two plastic shoe boxes on top of eachother, on each shelf and make three side by side rows of them with about 6 inches of space to spare. It's a really good product.",

The lower half of the handle just dangles there it is not secure. On one side of the cabinet the wood from one of the side pieces shows thru as if not lined up properly and the other side is not showing the under wood\u2026 so that aesthetically frustrating bc we lined it up exactly the way it should be! The absolute worst part is the cabinet doors do not line up at all! The handles are not aligned with each other either\u2026",

                "reviewText": "After shopping around for I don't know how long I finally came upon these two (yes TWO) cabinets. I was looking for a dresser but they were too expensive so I decided to look for a more unconventional approach to a dresser and this was it. Honestly best choice I could have made on a budget.The pieces are well made, no scratches and everything was packaged perfectly. I was super happy that nothing came damaged and each box was light enough that I didn't have to struggle to get in my house.All pieces were accounted for and instructions were super clear and easy to understand. I go based on the images in instructions because it helps me when I don't quite get the wording. Everything was clear and the images really helped with assembly. Extra pieces included which was amazing because not many sellers do that these days so you have to buy more pieces. NOT THIS SELLER!They are tall enough that I can use as a dresser to put things on and reach with great accessibility and they are wide enough that I can fit three clothing stacks of jeans, shirts, or even baskets comfortably in them. I think I even ran out of space and my previous dresser could never hold this much clothing.I know they are meant for dining room but honestly I feel like it gives my room a much needed upgrade to a more modern look and a much needed solution for storage of my clothes or other items I use regularly. Very pleased with the purchase. Have received many compliments and have been sending the link to so many people!10/10 Purchase. Seriously no complaints!",
