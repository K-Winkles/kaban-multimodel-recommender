                "reviewText": "This is a low-cost item, so, naturally you should expect thin plastic veneer on not-very-thick particle board. BUT it looks good, and (contrary to negative reviews here) I thought the assembly was very well documented and very easy. Now of course you DO have to follow the instructions! Apparently some people have found it difficult, and naturally they get annoyed and write bad reviews. I thought the instructions were excellent, the fasteners were very clearly packaged, and if you proceed in a methodical way, it shouldn't take more than an hour from start to finish. The alignment of predrilled holes was good, and the finished product is stable and reasonably sturdy. Lay out all the parts in alphabetical order, read the instructions carefully before performing each task, and you should have no problem.You will benefit from having two people when you are installing the doors. I did it alone, but holding a door in position while aligning the blunt-tipped hinge screws required some attention. It's easier if someone else holds the door for you. And you have to push hard to get those blunt screws started.The advice in the instructions to use a manual screwdriver is worth heeding. When screwing into particle board, don't overtighten, and don't use an electric screwdriver. If you overdo it and strip a hole, you'll have to use glue to hold a screw in place.After the assembly is finished, I suggest treating this item with a reasonably gentle touch. The finish will probably scratch quite easily, and slamming the doors is not a good idea. But if you treat it in a civilized fashion, it should last.That said, I think it is excellent value and looks good. Exactly as I hoped.NOTE: Pay attention to the shipping weight. The box is heavy. I cut it open where UPS left it, and carried some of the parts into the house before returning to pick up the rest.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice little wooden cabinet. It's not huge and not the sturdiest (for what I needed it for that is) but it does the job, is functional, and is of decent quality. It arrived quickly and undamaged. The cabinet was easy for me to assemble. I needed this item to store both a mini freezer as well as items pertinent to taking care of my indoor cat. The mini freezer I use it partially for wouldn't fit unless I removed the cardboard backing AFTER putting it together. Without the cardboard backing in place the cabinet wobbles a bit. I just wish there was a way to make it sturdier without the cardboard backing. If anyone on here, whether a customer or seller, knows of a way of doing so please contact me. That'd be very appreciated. So 4 strars for a good quality cabinet. The only thing I'd change is for it to be sturdier without the cardboard backing. For the price, one can not complain. However, from the photo I took of the front of the cabinet while in front of the cabinet, at least that aspect isn't noticeable :) Unless one intends to use this for storing a mini freezer or/and mini fridge, I'd highly recommend this cabinet.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to buy something that would be long and wide enough for my beardie enclosure",
                "reviewText": "This was the perfect size for my initial reptile enclosure and I wanted something that I could add on to when it was time to upgrade to a bigger enclosure. I had a hard time finding a typical tank stand the height and length that I needed. I decided on buying something along the lines of a table or dresser when I finally stumbled upon this cabinet. It\u2019s expensive for what it is but it\u2019s the ONLY stand I could find for what I needed so I initially purchased one, added gold legs, edging and handles. When it was time to upgrade my enclosures I bought another one and it lined up perfectly beside the first one I bought. It\u2019s not very sturdy for the price, it definitely wiggles and shifts until it\u2019s completed assembles and even then it\u2019s not the sturdiest, but it works for what I needed. I don\u2019t plan on moving my enclosure around and it can definitely support my 90 gallon tank so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine for it\u2019s intended purpose. All in all. I\u2019ll say this is expensive, the quality is decent and it was super simple to put together. What I love are the dimensions of the cabinet, so if you\u2019re looking for a nice wide deep and tall cabinet this is for you. But if you\u2019re willing to get something smaller you\u2019d end up spending a lot less on something potentially sturdier.But again, I needed something tall and wide for my 90 gallon tank and this was the only thing that even came close to matching it\u2019s depth so I\u2019m extremely satisfied with my purchase",
