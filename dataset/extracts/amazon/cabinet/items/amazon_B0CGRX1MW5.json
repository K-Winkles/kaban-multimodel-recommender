                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. ***update added below original review cuz no frame problem at all**Original: Instead of a wooden bureau, I'm using this piece for storage of clothing, bags, shoes and other items in the bedroom (I like clean, uncluttered surfaces.) The aesthetic is perfect for the space, the storage volume ideal and the price is reasonable. In fact very reasonable, as it's the cost of shipping (somewhere around $80) that elevates the price point so high.The piece comes well packed, but it's somehow not enough. The frame towards the bottom on my cabinet is bent in a way that makes it hard to open and close the doors. The upper two sets of doors work beautifully, which only emphasizes the problem with the bottom set of doors.It appears the risk of the frame bending may be a known problem due to the special packing around it, but unfortunately it wasn't enough this time.I think this large cabinet as a single unit is a design flaw. The frame cannot be made stronger because then the piece will be even heavier, and already the weight makes it almost impossible to work with. (You should hope the delivery is all the way into the room where it will live, it's that heavy.) This should have been made in smaller, modular pieces that can be locked together. Ikea used to sell the perfect lockers, which we had until my daughter took them, and they were four individual pieces assembled into one large piece slightly larger than this one. Unfortunately cannot get them anymore; the lockers they do sell at Ikea are tiny.I've alerted the seller to this problem. Depending on how that conversation goes I may be changing the star rating. This piece works well for me, if only it weren't a little bit broken.UPDATE HERE AS OF 1/23/24Not at all broken or warped! Now works as you see in the video.Two frame pieces were inserted correctly, but the third frame piece (where there was a problem with the door) was backwards.How do I know? I\u2019ve just come off the most extensive product support interaction I\u2019ve ever had with any vendor. If I could give 10 stars for service I would.I sent photos. They immediately saw the problem and MADE A VIDEO SHOWING ME HOW TO FIX IT. I mean, who does that? Some very nice people in China who believe in their product, that\u2019s who.The frame piece went in backwards because the directions didn\u2019t point out the directional need, but I suspect the directions will be upgraded after all this back and forth.There is still a small dent from shipping. The Ustamio staff have said they will make it right.They truly believe in customer service. We\u2019re talking Olympic gold-medal, black-belt level service. I wish they sold everything I need because I now want to give them absolutely all of my business. Thank you Ustamio.",
