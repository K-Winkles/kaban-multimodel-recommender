                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this cabinet! First, it has weight to it, unlike others I've ordered. Second, easy to assemble. Third, and most important, it looks so nice in my bathroom! I have a white vanity, but my fixtures and mirror are brushed nickel, so the all white cabinets just didn't add anything to the space. With the glass design on the (hinged) doors, it just pulls it all together. It hasa simple and clean look, with just enough \"bling\" to make it look elegant. Absolutely would reccomend! One con, which is important to note before trying to install it, is that the screws on the back, scratched my wall when we were trying to position it. Partially my fault because we just kind of slid it here and there to get it right, but that should be taken into account when hanging it. **Simple fix, I covered the screws with a litter painters tape and it was all good! I would buy 10 more if I needed them, regardless of the screw issue!! \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "The Good: This is a decent little shelf unit. Many hangable shelves are much more expensive than this and this one comes with a lot more personality. This is just slightly smaller than what you expect, but will look just like the picture. It holds several toiletry products, 3 toilet paper rolls and 3 cans of smell-good sprays with ease. Assembly took very little time and seemed somewhat self-explanatory. My 3 year old assisted me in the assembly, if that tells you anything. For a hanging shelf, I'm not sure much more needs to be said. It does the job and looks nice.The Meh: There were some paint globs around the top of the windows (which wasn't noticeable in my lighting once hung) and the knob holes were not perfectly aligned, but they're close (the one on the right is slightly lower and to the right). It doesn't bother my wife, but drives me a little insane with my OCD tendencies. I bought different knobs at a local home store as the ones that come with this are cheap plastic things that my 8 year old loved and I hated. If you're going to replace those, don't put them on as they'll leave a silver ring on your doors after being removed (and if the other knobs don't fit the same circumference against the paint, you'll always see the rings unless you paint over them).I'm undecided if I would recommend this to a friend or not... My friend in a starter home...? maybe. My parents...? probably not. It works fine in my house and looks nice, not tacky or cheap. It's a fine line on this one...",

                "reviewText": "Alright, so I was a bit hesitant about this purchase due to mixed reviews, but following a price drop I decided to give it a go b/c it looked pretty.My assessment: 1) It arrived incredibly well packaged, the hardware was in a cute, well labeled blister pack with perforated doors (think advent calendar), attached to the product with a string (pic #1) I'm not sure why this tickled me, but it did.2) Based on other reviews I laid everything out to ensure nothing was damaged (pic #2) and was again reassured by how well it was protected in the box.3) The instruction manual had no words and a few times I wondered if they had mislabeled their pictured pieces (turns out the perspective was switched to better demonstrate the task, apparently). Assembly took about an hour (I was being a bit extra, double checking my illustration comprehension), but it was a straight forward process overall. I opted to trust the manufacturer directions and made sure everything matched up and it turned out well (picture #3).4) There were many comments about color, which is tricky to speak to; color differentials on monitors and lighting matter... So I'll speak to what I can. I have an oil bronzed motif going on in my bathroom and the mirror trim is pretty damn close to black, but not quite. Picture #4 has a panel from the cabinet to the right of my dark mirror trim, with the overhead light on. Picture #5 has the panel on the left with a less direct light source. Definitely lighter than my trim, but looks a lot closer in dimmer light.5) Hanging the cabinet was a two person job (one to hold the cabinet up and one to screw), that or telekinesis. They provided a premeasured screw hole template that worked pretty well. That said, leveling a piece of paper is a little bit tricky and it probably would have been a tad more efficient to measure the wall/hole placement, but I was rolling with the whole trust the manufacturer thing, or something....I will update if anything catastrophic happens, but I am quite pleased with the product! *Disclaimer, I have no idea if my pictures will load in the correct order so some detective work may be necessary.",
