This seemed to fit but i was worried about quality. So far its really sturdy and heavier materials than other items i have got that were similar.The only downside i could think of is the instructions are a little complicated and i would recommend 2 people put it together as it was difficult with one person trying to hold a piece while trying to align another heavier piece. Once together though it does look really nice as well.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 seperate pieces, from 2 stores, although, they appear to come from the same address and same manufacturer. I placed a normal high style chair in front of it on the 2nd photo, and a standard wire hanger on the last, as well as placed random things in it for reference of what will possibly fit. Note, I only added 1 of the shelves. Don't make the mistake of expecting a normal size kitchen or dining room cabinet! Despite the fact that I did know the dimensions, it is still a bit shorter and narrower than I actually imagined it would be, because the ad photos make it look so tall and wide. In reality it is really closer to the size you would expect to see in a like a large style playhouse for a child, or even as a bathroom cabinet, maybe even in a small apartment. Sturdiness could be better, as it does have a slight wobble to it. The piece next to it is a little better as far as design and sturdiness goes, they should consider using similar reinforcements like was used on the other piece in the photo to tighten that slight wobble it has. It comes with extra pieces for just in case, and you can arrange the shelving how you want it, which is a bonus. I am exactly 5'4 1/2\", and it stands slightly shorter than me. So I can see the entire top when standing in front of it. They rounded up on the size they listed, the actual size is 5' & 7/8\" . It is perfect for storage in a small room or area. Looks pretty strange if you have high ceilings, or a large room, definitely meant for lower ceilings with smaller room space. It would still be excellent for a bathroom, small bedroom or of course, a standard size apartment. I love cabinets like these, the amount of stuff you can organize and fit in them is amazing, so it truly has a wide range of uses. I am already looking at more styles to complete a full wall storage area in a small room to use for my small business product storage. Really a lot of pros to buying it, but a few cons on this one, the price almost matches the size and quality of it. (More below on that note) I wish it was slightly taller, but of course, it is actually made shorter on purpose for smaller sized homes or areas. 1 very minor design flaw with this one that I am not a fan of, is the wall attachment. For some reason they made this one where 2 holes get drilled in the top to connect the anchor piece. And because it is short, it is very visible. Don't do it until last! I did it before all was complete thinking it would be hidden like the other cabinet, and I really wish I hadn't, although it seems insignificant, it ruins the asthetics of it. It really is a pretty cabinet.Because it is a bit wobbly, and has the design flaw of connecting to the wall with the anchor visible, also the fact that it is more of a playhouse child size, I really feel that the price is a slightly too high for this. If it were in the range of $140 - $150 taxes, delivery, all included, it would be about right, and I would then rate it at 5 star. I payed about $184 with taxes and delivery ( which is around $7 more than what I payed for the cabinet next to it.) If they removed the delivery fee or lowered the cost by even at least $20 or $30 than it would be more appropriately priced. But that is of course only my personal opinion on what I would be willing to pay for it, if I had seen it in person first, or if I ordered another.I guess it really depends on where you plan to put it and how you plan to use it. For me, in the end, the size is fine for the 9x10 room it will be in, the 2 pictured don't even take up 5 feet of space, and can hold a lot of small items while leaving me plenty of room for more cabinets. It is a good storage option for perfumes and other bath & body products that I manufacture. Despite my opinion of it being a bit overpriced, overall, it is a decent cabinet, cute and functional, but not quite the size of normal cabinets you would expect to see in a dining or kitchen area.",
