The plywood was too soft on one piece, so the top doors ended up being slightly off/not squared... still worked, but my OCD just sees the variance. The cabinet holds a lot and has a clean look, so I'm keeping it for now, but will replace when I find a better quality product.",

I bought a bigger/longer one a few years ago for the same price but the wood is not top quality for that type of price. I had to get new one cause the wood at the bottom broke off but for this product the price is high for not good wood quality that it is.",

After assembling it, I was extremely disappointed at how LITTLE this thing is. The pictures give the impression that the cabinet will be much larger with much more storage than it actually has. Not only is the thing crazy little, but it also tips over forward much too easily. Hard pass on this & returning it as soon as I disassemble it.",
