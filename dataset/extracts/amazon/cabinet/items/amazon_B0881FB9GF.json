The instructions are visual and you really need to pay attention, but all-in-all it was easy. I did use a power screw driver after a blister formed on my hand - wish I had started with it. The unit is as sturdy as you would expect; needs to have the funky back put on so the shelf doesn't slip out. I'm using it to free up a kitchen drawer and some pantry space (just napkins, paper cups, coffee stuff) until I remodel the kitchen. Then, I plan to take it to the master closet. Light enough for me (old lady) to move around. This is not fine furniture but looks fine in the kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these and assembled them by myself. The instructions do need some work to make it clearer which way something goes but other than that, they were pretty good. I had no problems of holes not lining up until I got to the hinges which seemed like the holes were too far up for the hinge to sit flat on the inside but finally figured it out. Another problem I had is that one of the knobs is broken, it won't tighten on the screw and just spins around and around. The screw part is fine, this is a problem with the knob itself. I planned on having black knobs so I am not concerned about it but thought I would mention it for those that have no plans on changing them knobs.The drawers and doors all work well although the doors are a tiny bit off. There is no adjustment in the hinges so I haven't a clue how to get them exact but it is such a tiny amount (see photo) I am not even worried about it. (I have put together many cabinets in my years and you should see how 'off' some are. This isn't nothing!)I loved the back of this cabinet! Yes, it is a thin piece of pressboard or whatever it is made out of but it is white to match the cabinets on both sides. There are two pieces but also a plastic strip for the center, each piece fits inside this plastic \"I\" strip for joining of the pieces which also adds strength. Also, it is not just tacked on, it is screwed on all the way around with little screws. This is the first time I had seen this. Other cabinets are two pieces with no joiner, and are tacked on with those little tacks that pull out as soon as you hit the back of the cabinet inside by pushing a pot or pan too far back. Not happening with this one!I just wish there was more information on the cabinets that covered adding adjustable legs since this has none. For example: Can I add adjustable legs inside the scalloped bottom in the corners or do I have to take that scalloped bottom off and add them in that exact same spot that scalloped bottom was?)To sum it up, I am very happy with the cabinets. They went together very well. Everything was marked, not only the pieces but the screw bags as well. I think it is quite sturdy and I really need this extra storage space.I do recommend these cabinets.",

                "reviewText": "#Cons:- This is one of those products that I think it's worth mentioning the cons first. You'll have to decide if it's worth the time you spend vs the money you spend for it before complaining.It takes me around 5 hours to get everything together because the instruction manual has only pictures. Yes, it'll be guess work and sometimes when you put things in the wrong place, you'll have to go back and fix your mistakes. So it's best to have an electric drill to undo your wrongdoings, if any. So it isn't easy to assemble.- Have to be somewhat gentle. These are made of sturdy boards, not solid wood. You can't go ham with your drill and expect it to hold up. You'll only make parts look unparalleled because of unnecessary force.- Be careful when installing the rails. I put up a picture so you can see what's up. Because I put them in the wrong positions before and it was hard to go back when everything else is finished. The part with a long hollow section will be on the sides of your drawers. So you'll just have to make sure your rails fit on either sides. Sometimes the manual guidelines don't do a good job of explaining, and/or the pictures belong to older models, they don't fit.#Pros:- MDF board, which is Medium Density Fiberboard. But because it's not plywood, you don't have to worry about mold, bug, or wood cracking.Plus, it's stronger and more durable.- That's also why it has a great value. Because MDF board. I grabbed this when it was $140. I could have spent at least $100-$200 or more to get something similar. So I'd buy again if I could.- Lots of storage capacity. My apartment kitchen is small. So having this cabinet is not only giving me counter space, but also a ton of storage that I don't have. This is a winner for small space living.- Have many usages. I use the cabinet storage as a stationary kitchen island as well. I serve it with some bar stools and voila, it's a small dining table for 2.- You can move the inner shelf to a different level to suit your needs.- Magnetic lock. Ah yes. Some cabinet till this day doesn't equip with this feature. Go figure. Closing/opening the cabinet doors is a breeze.#Verdict:- Definitely worth a buy. Save me a lot of money if I want to spend on a similar cabinet.- Have someone to help you so it'll cut down time in half. Like I said I put together alone and it took me roughly 5 hours mainly because some parts I didn't do right based on wrong/old model pictures, so I had to redo them. But 2 people would make it easier.- Lay out every single part and label everything if it's missing. You'll thank me later. It helps me a lot in grabbing the right piece. Good luck.",

It did take up one whole section in the cabinet but fit my purpose. Putting it together I did cause some of the paint to scratch off around the screws but you don\u2019t really notice it once completely together so just be careful when tightening the screws. The drawers roll in and out smoothly and the doors open and close with ease. I feel that this is made well! My favorite part is the top piece! The wood is very smooth and thick!
