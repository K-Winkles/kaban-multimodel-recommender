Assembly of the cabinets was easy, but it required another person to assist with attaching the doors. The information added to the instructions for adjusting the placement of the doors was very helpful. Reviewers of similar products complained of a toxic odor, which is why I did not by theirs. This product had no odor. It is very well made, sturdy, attractive, and will service our needs well for many years.",

                "reviewText": "This is a review of REHOOPEX Set of 2 Black Side Storage Cabinet.I have no idea what came over me that I decided I would tackle putting this together by myself. I am the person who will call Task Rabbit in a heartbeat to put stuff together.Boy, am I so glad I decided to give it a shot. I feel so accomplished now. I bought the 2-pack of these and put both of them together all by myself! If you are like me, I suggest you give it a try, it really isn't that hard....really! If you are used to putting stuff together, this will be a breeze. It took about an hour to put the first one together and maybe 35 minutes to put the second one together using power tools.For newbs like me, here are a few hints to help you out.1. Lay out all of your pieces so you know exactly what you have. All of the pieces and hardware are labeled perfectly.2. When you get to step 2 be aware of the orientation of the board. This will be your middle shelf. I wasn't fully aware and wound up with the shelf upside down (where the screws show on top) on the first one I put together. I got it right on the second one. Maybe one day I'll take the first one apart and flip it over - or maybe not since you can't tell once the shelf is filled with stuff.3. Use a power tool to put it together. I was done in no time with an electric screwdriver. It would've taken forever with a manual screwdriver. You will get an allen wrench for some of the screws as well.4. In order to not drive myself nuts, when attaching the hinges to the sideboard by myself, I actually turned the unit on its side which made it a breeze to drill the hinge screws into place.5. If you still aren't sure you can do it, just ask the seller to send you the directions before purchasing so you can see exactly what it entails. That is what I am doing for other items I am purchasing now.I wanted different handles than what comes with it. I read another review where the person gave the measurements to look for (7-9/16 192mm center to center). I found these on Amazon, on sale for $10 each (B09L5C16WC). They come in various finishes. If you decide to get these, here's a little tip: the handles come with 2 sizes of screws. Use the shorter ones with this unit. You're welcome :).I still have to tweak the doors a bit to get them lined up to my exacting look, but I got them close on my first try and it doesn't look too bad right now.I am super happy with the purchase. The price for two was reasonable, everything came in perfect condition, it looks just as described, and was easy to put together.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this cabinet to store homemade tinctures, teas, and medicine. It works perfectly for what we needed.It is sold as a smaller floor cabinet but we bought it to put on our countertop in our kitchen. It was perfect for our space.It was simple to put together but having two people helps. One side of the cabinet had holes that didn\u2019t line up perfectly and caused the door to drag a little when opening but we were able to fix it.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this little cabinet with glass doors. It made a very functional addition to our home.",

I\u2019m always a little nervous buying furniture online because too often it turns out to be very thin particle board with cheap hardware. So I was thrilled that this was actually sturdy with quality materials. It looks great! The doors have better hinges than any other cabinets I\u2019ve bought in this price range, so they open and close quietly and sit level. Very pleased!!",

I had to pick mine up from the post office, because Amazon will not deliver to my home address anymore. There are a lot of different pieces and you have to be very careful about how you put them together and also be ready for a big time commitment, I am not used to putting that many pieces together and they did not all fit well especially not the smaller screws. Be prepared to be very patient with the little bitty holes that they made to screw the screws into. You can trust the instructions, they are pretty good, and easy to follow for the most part. Now that everything\u2018s put together it looks really good as my drink cabinet.",
