                "reviewText": "I needed a narrow yet functional cabinet to fill an otherwise useless space in my very small bathroom, and this cabinet was as close as I was going to get without getting something custom made! It took me about 30 minutes to assemble and it looks exactly as I expected. The magnetic closure actually works and the shelves can move around to fit your needs. For the price point, I am very happy with this purchase!",

The information states 11\"D x 13.5\"W x 32\"H. It should be 13\"Deep x 11\"Wide x 32\"H. That two inches made a difference in my small bathroom, which it what i bought it for. 11\" inches deep would have fit. Now I need to find another place for it. Unfortunately, in my eyes, waste of money. The supplier still made money.",
