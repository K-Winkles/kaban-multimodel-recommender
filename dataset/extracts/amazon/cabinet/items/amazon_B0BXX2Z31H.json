It\u2019s a good size to hold extra glassware and the shelves free up space on my countertop for some smaller items. I\u2019m changing the door pulls to something nicer.

I had become less cheerful with the broken door on the box that was secured with duct tape. Going to Amazon for the solution I discovered quite a number of possible options. Size was key in making my selection needing to hold a lot in a small space. The little counter cabinet is perfect with a total of three shelves everything fit.
