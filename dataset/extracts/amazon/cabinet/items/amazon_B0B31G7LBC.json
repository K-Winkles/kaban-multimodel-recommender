                "reviewText": "I got this for my kitchen that lacks pantry space and I like it. My trash can fits nicely underneath. It's pretty wobbly but that's just due to its design being top-heavy. I secured it better by adjusting the leg's positioning and using some anti-slip furniture feet on them. Easy assembly. Probably not a great choice if you have kids around or cats that will jump on it, even if it is secured to the wall. I keep some smaller pantry goods in mine and it works great for that. I just keep the heaviest stuff (like soup cans) on the lower shelves for stability purposes. Nice quality for the price, only thing I didn't like was the cheap finish it came in. I ended up painting mine black and replacing the knobs and it looks 5x nicer now. Overall, I'm very happy with it.",
