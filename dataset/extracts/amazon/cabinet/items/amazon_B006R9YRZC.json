                "reviewText": "I bought one of the these Sienna Oak cabinets about 5 years ago and it was so easy to assemble and looked great and has held up perfectly that when I needed more cabinet space I didn't hesitate to go back to the Sauder brand. I found the exact same cabinet and it was as easy to assemble as the first time I remembered. The package came in a well protected box with heavy, heavy duty cardboard around all the edges so no damage at all was able to chip off the edges. The price was right too. Big enough to store my larger appliances and all my canning! The depth is 17+ inches which was hard to find in some cabinets so it fits my big stuff. All the pre-drilled holes are perfectly placed but I think the best thing is the directions are so easy to follow, even this 73 year old woman put this together by herself in about 2 hours. All I needed was a screwdriver and a small hammer. The backing could be stronger like other reviewers mentioned but this has caused me zero problems over the years. The two cabinets fit together so perfectly they look like one. If I buy furniture to assemble it is going to be Sauder. I've assembled plenty of items but these directions are the best. I would buy again!",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy cabinet...but not fine furniture. That\u2019s just not possible at this price point. Yes, it\u2019s made out of MDF. Yes, it\u2019s a laminate surface. However, it does not feel fragile, will be easy to keep clean, can store a lot for its size, and is reasonably attractive. That\u2019s why it gets five stars from me. The color is accurate from the pictures on Amazon, and no discrepancies from the product description. It\u2019s good value for the money. Better than most Pre-Pak furniture.Start to finish, it took me about 2 hours to put it together, with just a little help from a friend to turn it over, hang the doors, and move it into place. He helped during commercials while watching a football game. I\u2019m a 66 year old grandmother with a few basic building skills...I do know how to use a hammer and a Phillips screwdriver, which is all that\u2019s necessary. All the parts, including the presorted hardware, are all labeled and instructions are clear. If you go step-by-step, handle the pieces carefully, and work on a soft surface, you should have no trouble putting it together without damage (or too much frustration!). With each step, don\u2019t tighten the screws completely until all of them are started. Be sure you have the piece squared up before you nail the backing (VERY IMPORTANT), and you\u2019ll have little to no trouble hanging the doors and getting them even. I was surprised that my doors required no adjusting at all. I\u2019ve put together a few pieces of IKEA furniture, and this was similar in difficulty. Note that each shelf has a 25 pound limit, and nothing heavy on the top.About the packaging.... I was a little worried when it arrived. The outside was loosely wrapped in heavy plastic, and it looked like it might be damaged at the ends. When opening the box, however, all the pieces were fine. There was only a little packing inside, but very sturdy corners added to box. Be sure to check all the pieces before tossing the box and packing.",

                "reviewText": "Aesthetically appealing storage cabinet at a decent price. Because of the negative reviews, I had some reservations about ordering this storage cabinet. Based on reviews, it seemed that because of quality control issues, meaning damaged parts or missing hardware, I was concerned the cabinet I might receive would be hit or miss.I'm happy to report that everything I received was fine, except for a few small imperfections on the exterior cabinetry... meaning nicks or scratches on the surface. Although these imperfections aren't glaring, this is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.This product is very heavy. My box actually had a label cautioning that the weight was over 75 pounds. I needed this cabinet upstairs so had to drag it into the house to unpack it downstairs, then carry pieces of it upstairs for assembly.I'm a 63 year old woman but consider myself DIY handy. I assembled this cabinet on my own. The cabinet was fairly easy to put together. The instructions for assembly are clear and very easy to follow. I had some issues with assembling the base. Mainly lining up the screws on both sides of the base but, with some persistence, I eventually assembled the base just fine.The cardboard backing was a little tricky because it comes folded in the shipping box. Because of this, there is a tendency for the cardboard backing to sag in the middle, making it difficult to align it perfectly square on the back of the cabinet. I never did get it to line up perfectly square, however, I was able to get the backing lined up enough that it didn't overlap the sides of the cabinet.The doors were also a bit tricky. After standing the cabinet upright, the instructions say to attach the left side door first. Being right handed, it would have been easier to attach the right door first. The reason being, the doors don't fully open to the side. The doors open perpendicular, 90 degrees, to the cabinet. This allowed very little room for me to get in there and attach the right door, so had to use my left hand to do so. Since I was putting this cabinet together by myself, I used a very thin book (estimated between an eighth to quarter inch) to help prop up the doors to help get the doors to the proper height so I could easily attach them.Once the doors were in place, I did have to make minor adjustment which I found very easy to do. The door adjustments are clearly outlined in the assembly instructions.All said, I enjoyed putting the cabinet together in spite of having a few minor frustrations. I felt accomplished in the end. I have this cabinet on carpeting in an office space and unlike some of the reviews, this cabinet feels stable and sturdy. I did not find it necessary to attach the wall mount support.I am very happy with this purchase, however, like I said, what gets shipped to you can be hit or miss.I ordered another piece of Sauder furniture to match this cabinet for my office at the same I purchased this item. The bottom of the cabinet (Part D), and the front skirt (Part H) were not the correct pieces for this cabinet and too large by two inches. I had to return that item and re-order. But, that's a whole other review!If everything goes well, the Sauder products are great and well worth the money. If things don't go well, it can be a pain. With success of this particular product, I would still recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this storage unit. I used it as a pantry cabinet in my kitchen. The oak colour matches the colour of my kitchen cabinets. This unit is a good value for your money. Also it was easy to assemble, the instructions for the installation was very clear. It took both my son and I two hours to put it together. My only complaint is that when completed there is a gap between the doors. Other than that I am satisfied with this unit, It's functional and serves the purpose for what I needed it for.",

                "reviewText": "It was very easy to assemble; I did it by myself. I love that it's tall, but narrow, so that it gives you a lot of storage space without taking up too much space in the room. (I used to have a different brand that was shorter but wider, and this one is so much better!) I also like that you can adjust each of the feet individually; my floor is a bit crooked, so I just adjusted one foot, and the cabinet is level and doesn't wobble. It's quite sturdy. I wish it had one more shelf, but that's a minor thing, and the manufacturer's website has an order form where you can order extra shelves.",

                "reviewText": "These cabinets are in my book somewhere between generic Chinese and IKEA. The finish quality is good, but most IKEA furniture has better finish. The build quality is also good. At the maximum height the doors still rub against the lower panel, but at least they align well.The construction is however on the flimsy side. I wish it has better joints for the upper and lower panels (see below), and perhaps another structural panel in the middle (like many other cabinets). I also wish the back was made out of something else than the usual cardboard.My main complaint (sturdiness, or rather lack thereof) is caused by the horrible Sauder Twist-lock joints. They are easy to assemble but will most likely pull out at the slightest load. More solid joints are available, cheap, and in my opinion should have been used. Easy to assemble (which is done once) should never trump utility (sturdiness). With the Twist-lock joints the upper board is not load bearing (it barely holds itself), which also impacts negatively the sturdiness of the whole cabinet.Finally, it should be noted that the cabinet costs $200 direct from Sauder (that's about $260 Canadian), which is about $100 less than the price on Amazon.ca.Overall i like the cabinet and I do not regret my purchase. Next time however I will head straight to IKEA instead.",
