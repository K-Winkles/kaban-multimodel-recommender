This cabinet was the only one in the 50 - 80 price range that had a decorate lip on the top, the others looked like the manufacturers had placed a shelf on it. My husband didn't cuss once when he put it together so it's easy and no missing parts. The door works great and it's roomy considering it's size. I wish it came in a color that matched my shower curtain but oh well, besides the surface could take a spray paint if I needed to. I wanted solid wood but can't find one in the size I need and this one will do very nicely.",
