                "reviewText": "This cabinet fits our needs perfectly. It was really easy to assemble but unfortunately I got 2 bags of one of the parts and didn\u2019t get another part I needed at all. It was the pegs for the shelves to sit on. So I was completely finished building before I realized they were missing. I talked to customer service and they gave me several options. Instead of waiting to receive the part from overseas I decided to just use some dowels to hold up the shelves. They still gave me a partial refund even though I opted to not do a return (since it was already built). So they were great in trying to fix the problem. Very pleased with the customer service and the product. \ud83d\udc4d",

It is in the old (renovating house) bathroom to help with storage and to brighten it up a little. It is sturdy enough to be comfortable to stack the shelves and put something on top. Drawer is the size it says but still holds some daily necessities so they are handy. The design is simple yet fun. All in all - a good purchase.",

Well I must say all the years buying from Amazon and some of their vendors, this was the FIRST time a company contacted me very concerned about my happiness with their product. Not only did they contact me, they rectified the situation! I'm very happy that I dealt with their company. Will purchase again knowing they respond to their customers!",
