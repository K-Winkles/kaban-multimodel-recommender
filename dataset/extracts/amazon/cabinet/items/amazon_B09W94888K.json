                "reviewText": "As someone who has been putting together flat-pack furniture for 15+ years, I can say this is one of the more impressive pieces I've assembled. Good quality materials (for this kind of thing) and the instructions were clear and easy to understand 95% of the time. Took this carpenter's daughter 2 hours flat to put it together on my own.The \"wood\" material is pretty heavy duty. The finish chips off easily if you slip with the screwdriver though, so just beware of that. I love that the backing is two pieces of thin board that slide in place instead of the common cardboard like stuff that gets nailed to the back. This looks and feels so much more solid.I also love that the drawers are screwed together instead of using the cam-locking method. Cams always make for a less secure join and they tend to loosen with time. These drawers are screwed together with 1.25\" screws. They are not going anywhere! I personally like that these don't have the metal drawer guides too. In a regular cabinet with good quality materials that's great, but on these lesser quality pieces they tend to feel loose and not sit right, often making the drawers look lopsided and not close perfectly. So even though it is harder to pull the drawers in and out without metal guides, I prefer this because it feels more solid and long lasting. I'll get some wax on the slides and that should help with movement.I also love that the door has simple hinges instead of the ones that are more complex. Again, great in a real cabinet, but tend to be problematic with lesser quality materials which end up leaving too much wiggle room. The simple hinge just gets screwed in and it's straight and sturdy the first time! Tip: I didn't screw the magnetic stop down all the way at first and tightened it once the door was on to get it in just the right spot for the door to close flush to the box and the magnet to hold well.A couple notes, some of the dowels fit loosely, so some dowel glue would've make everything a bit more sturdy. And a couple of screws on the drawers stripped. Not absolutely perfect, but looks good and feels good and sturdy overall.Bottom line, I love this cabinet! It's better quality than most of what's out there and I think it's going to last many years. Highly recommend!",

Would love if the drawers were just a little larger and the height was just a little shorter (just for the space I have it) but over all, this is a great product and very sturdy! I bought to give added storage in my kitchen. This is perfect as it gives 4 drawers and 3 shelves. The other products were plastic and this one isn't. Beautiful grey color goes amazingly well with my kitchen. Highly recommend. Would be great anywhere for added storage space.",

                "reviewText": "We live in an apartment and have used a plastic 4-tier shelf for many, many years. It was always collecting dust and items looked scattered. I came across this item on Amazon and I loved the simplicity and organization it provided. It was time to replace the shelf for a cleaner, more organized appearance in the bathroom. My daughter and I put it together with a screwdriver. It was easy to put together. There were some simple instructions missing (like the knob and metal piece to connect to magnet when door shuts), but with common sense you know what to do. There were also instructions to screw in screws in the back board to the unit, but there were no pre-drilled holes so we just omitted that. It does not affext functionality by omitting. We also did not put the drawer stops in the drawers except for one, so we can pull them all the way out if needed. There was one drawer front that was the right shape but cut wrong and drilled wrong, so the last drawer could not be completed, but the company is sending a replacement. They communicated very quickly to resolve the issue.Only 4 stars because of the strong smell and we have chemical sensitivities, but hopefully the smell will dissipate with time. It is a beautiful unit once together and held so many things. It is very helpful. We can fit 8 rolls of toilet paper on each shelf if needed, but we just use one shelf and the others for storage. Small plastic storage bins from DG fit perfectly in there!This unit will likely not be large enough for storing bath towels, but could hold washcloths and hand towels. I was also able to fit a large Softsoap refill bottle and shampoos and cleaners on the shelves. Hairbrushes fit perfectly in the drawer with a slight bit of room...that's about the length of the inside of the drawers, to give you an idea.Overall, we are happy with the purchase and it is perfect for our bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "This cabinet looks great when assembled, was well packaged and the assembly was easy and not stressful. Instructions are easy to follow, everything lines up perfectly and they even include 1 extra of the screws, dowel rods and other connectors for us clumsy people that drop things into that black hole where all lost things go. Assembly took about an hour and I was able to do it solo (I\u2019m a 56yo woman). The only tool you need is a phillips screwdriver (recommend magnetic if you have it, I didn\u2019t). I did use a rubber mallet to place the pegs for the drawers ( they keep you from pulling the drawers all the way out which I LOVE-first time I have seen that on something like this) but that isn\u2019t required, you can just push them in place, I don\u2019t have a lot of hand strength so I used the mallet. Instructions say to use a pad, I just used the styrofoam that came in the box and it worked great. Definitely great quality at a great price!!",
