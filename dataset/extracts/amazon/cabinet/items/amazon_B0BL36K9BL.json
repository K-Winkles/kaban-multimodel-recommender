It was a little tricky only because the instructions were only of pictures. The problem I had was the upper hole for the bar that held the door shut, was not there. I am referring to the side of the cabinet where the handle is. I ended up making one, which was not an easy task, as the cabinet is metal and I am not handy with tools. All in all, the cabinet is beautiful, and it is about 47 inches tall, which I love.",

With a bustling household and a garage that doubles as a creative space, finding a spot for all our crafting supplies was becoming a challenge. Enter this sturdy metal cabinet, and suddenly, our space feels organized and our supplies are neatly tucked away.The adjustable shelves allow us to customize the storage to fit everything from bulky fabric bolts to tiny beads and threads. Its lockable design means we can keep curious little hands safe from sharp tools and toxic materials. The matte finish not only looks sleek but also hides fingerprints and smudges, making it a practical choice for a high-traffic area like ours.Assembly was straightforward, thanks to clear instructions. My husband and son had it up and running in about 30 minutes, which is no small feat in a home as hectic as ours. It meets our needs perfectly, keeping our crafting area tidy and our supplies out of sight but within easy reach. It's not just for crafting supplies; this cabinet is versatile enough for any room that needs decluttering.",

                "reviewText": "I am using this cabinet to store various items in my garage, and couldn't be happier with it.Assembly was simple and straightforward. I had it up and ready to go by myself in about a half hour. It looks very nice and is overall very stable. I have it loaded up with quite a bit of weight on each shelf, and it is holding up well.Can't really think of any complaints in the couple of months that I've had it.",

                "reviewText": "GangMei Metal Storage Cabinet, Garage Storage Cabinet with Locking and 4 Adjustable is product reviewed.This is one HEAVY package!!! Definitely need two people to handle it. Once open, it's easy enough to assemble but is much easier if you have someone to hold things for you while screwing panels in. So not a difficult assembly just picky.I use it for clothing rather than for garage, office, etc and love it! I have so much more room for all of my clothes and can see at a glance what's what rather than using a dresser! More than enough room for all my clothes! Shelves are wide and easy to reposition as needed. I did get several baskets to organize smaller items on the shelves and it's SO nice!I did notice one door that was slightly bent and since it's not a huge problem ( I have to press on the left hand door while closing the right) and is easy to do anyhow...it's a shipping problem and NOT a product issue.I'm unable to put the screws in to hold it against the wall for safety (walls are concrete blocks and I just can't drill holes) so I have it in my hallway where if it tips, it just hits the other wall and won't fall over. I also made sure to put some really heavy items in the bottom for storage as well.Overall, a good product and I am so happy to have it!! Looks great and makes my life easier!",

                "reviewText": "This metal cabinet\u2019s package is pretty heavy and needs at least two people to hold it and bring it in. I would suggest to open the package and assemble it where you would like to place it and use it. The assembly was simple but was little time taking and both my husband and son took like 30 min to assemble it. This storage cabinet comes with four shelves which can be adjusted according to your needs. I have used this cabinet in our closet to store my party wear and new clothes, so that they do not accumulate any dust in my closet and also I find it easier to look at all the clothes I have in a glance. The metal storage cabinet is white in color and matches with my white cube shelving in the closet. It is sturdy and looks very nice and serves the purpose. It can also be used in various areas in your home like garage, basement, office room, kitchen, etc., to store stationary, books, household supplies, tools, extra pantry essentials, etc., Overall a very sturdy simple and good looking cabinet.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the 41\" beige cabinet.It was very easy to assemble, but when they say that it requires an assistant, they're not kidding. You need a hand to hold the screw, one to hold the screwdriver, and one to hold the piece erect. But knowing that going it, it's a fairly trivial assembly. Parts are well marked and the manual is straightforward.It's not bad looking and it does the job, but the metal is thin and it flexes easily. They provide hardware to screw it to the wall, but if that's not an option (my wall is concrete) or if you simply don't want to deface the wall, the cabinet bends without a lot of work and it makes it difficult to close the door without pushing the front one way or another.I found that if I placed the cabinet on thin shims and used leveling wedges, I was able to line up the front so that the doors would close properly.Personally, I think that for what you get, the cabinet is a bit overpriced ($110 for 41\" tall cabinet).",
