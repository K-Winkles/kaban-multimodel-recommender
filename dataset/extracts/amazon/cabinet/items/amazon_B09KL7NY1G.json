                "reviewText": "I love the way this looks for the price point. It\u2019s perfect for a small angled wall in our hallway, that helps add a little storage space to our home that is lacking cabinets. Fits a bunch of kids towels/washclothes, a dozen boxes of tissues/toilet paper, and some cute Knick knacks in the open shelves for style.",

                "reviewText": "I will start off by saying I am very handy. This is not to brag. This is for context so you know where I\u2019m coming from. I\u2019ve installed flooring, tile backsplashes, baseboards, light fixtures, bifold doors, faucets, the list goes on and on. I use a lot of power tools. I am a very hardcore DIYer, in other words, and am perfectly willing to pour extensive time and effort into projects.I am returning this because I cannot make it work without hours of effort and extra materials. Every hole is misplaced, missing, or too large (the dowels and screws flop around). I can\u2019t drill new holes because they\u2019d need to overlap with the existing ones and would compromise the MDF (would probably split it). To make this work, I would need to use wood putty, construction adhesive, and more. It is also the worst quality MDF I\u2019ve ever seen. Infinitely worst than even the Target Room Essentials cheapo cubby storage units (not the nicer Threshold ones!). If this was $30 I might be willing to take some time and \u201chack\u201d it, but this was $90+. My expectations were low and this didn\u2019t even come close to meeting them.Returning this type of item is a total pain but it\u2019s still a much better option than keeping this piece of garbage.",
