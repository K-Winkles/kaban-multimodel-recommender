This cabinet went together in no time at all, maybe a half hour. Very sturdy! More room inside than meets the eye. For ours, the smell when we opened the box was a little strong but was almost like\u2026cinnamon? Could be worse! Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Paid 65$ and change for this cabinet and I don't feel it's worth that. Maybe 30 - 40$... All the pieces and hardware were present and it arrived on time. Some of the pieces are warped, and so there are minor misalignments in a few places, including the cabinet door. Assembly was easy and the instructions were clear enough. The painted surface is not durable at all. Simply attaching the hinges to the door ended up chipping some of it away, and there are already permanent scratches in the outter surface that seem to have happened during assembly. I guess I'll have to maybe get some waterproof contact paper to cover the outter edges or something. The cabinet is pretty low, so from a design standpoint, I'd have placed the cabinet knob at the top of the door instead of the center (but at least the knob isn't misaligned!).",
