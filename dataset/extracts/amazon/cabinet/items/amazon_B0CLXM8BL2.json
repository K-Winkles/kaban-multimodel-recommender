I\u2019m using it as a hair products extension for my makeup vanity set up and the middle section height is perfect for all the hair sprays and moose.You\u2019ll need a drill, the holes aren\u2019t pre screwed deep enough to build this by hand, or at least it would be extremely challenging.",

                "reviewText": "This storage cabinet is beautifully slim yet has an ample amount of storage space within its door compartment and shelves to hold face towels, body wash and bath soaps. Its meant to organize and layout inside the magnetically latched door that opens smoothly and its top two shelves for quick and easy to reach bathroom essentials.Installation process took a mere half an hour by following its manual to attach side pieces, back panel and shelf. Its inner shelf is height adjustable but sits on two side pegs as opposed to being drilled right into the sides. Once it came together, the cabinet takes up about 33\" in height with top 2 shelves having 7.25x7.5\" of room split across 11\" of vertical height. Inside the bottom door gives about 16 inches of height but split in half by its slightly smaller 7x7\" shelf space interior.Its actually a filled mix of sawdust and chips that are heat pressed to form the flat shelf panels and seems fairly durable for a compact size but lacks on water resistance to staining especially for being placed inside bathrooms.Being a unique high rise tower style form factor gives this cabinet an advantage to fit right within narrow spaces or gaps in bathrooms while having an ample amount of storage space inside. Sleek design in its minimalist white colored appearance and 3.75 inch rising painted bronze pedestal base looks beautiful yet practical for storing & organizing the bathroom.",
