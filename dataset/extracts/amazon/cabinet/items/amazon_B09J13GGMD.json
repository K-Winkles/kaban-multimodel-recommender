I ended up getting two of these because of how good they were, the setup took less than 15 mins, just your standard setup with a few bolts and screws. The magnetic hold is pretty good when you close the door, meaning that they won't just open up randomly. Neither one of my cabinets came with instructions, but it was very easy to figure out anyways. Overall, amazing storage, perfect for storing clothes, or using as a taller nightstand.",

Damaged areas were very evident all over- dings in the wood & missing/scratched paint. Missing (2) screws to attach the backing. Drawer doesn't want to open completely & opens crooked, & when you go to open it further it wants to fall out (see included video). The drawer is too small to even fit pillowcases well. The drawer bottom is very thin so don't put anything heavy in it. The doors touch when closing/opening them (& yes, I put it together correctly) & this will eventually cause the paint to scrape off.For a $50 to $80 cabinet, sure I could overlook most of these errors.

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect medium slate gray color. It\u2019s a project for sure, and it\u2019s in a million flat pieces and you need to do a DIY on your own to assemble it.Once together it\u2019s pretty sturdy and straight and not janky at all.The sides and shelves and whatnot are all very thick and sturdy.The drawer pulls out smoothly and there are two shelves that fit a surprising amount of stuff on the inside main part of the cabinet.It took maybe an hour to assemble and I was able to do it all my myself (adult female). I used a standard power drill to help with the process in combination with the small little flat pack hand tools provided.The hardware is a dark brass sort of shade that\u2019s like an antiqued gold color.I like that it\u2019s on it\u2019s own little feet so that it isn\u2019t a built in cabinet and you can move it around as needed or use it in different places as you move things around the house.I currently have it in my bathroom to hold my excessive amount of hair and bath products and such, but I may also use it later on in a hallway area for shoes and winter gear later on. I like that it\u2019s versatile enough to work in different ways around the house as you need it for whatever you need to organize.Overall I\u2019d recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros: - Teamson Home Mercer Free Standing Cabinet - Gray - Easy to assemble (took me about an hr w/ filming etc) \u25cb Simple pictoral instructions - Nice & Sturdy - Made of Durable MDF (except drawer bottom & back of cabinet) - Cabinet measures 13\" deep x 26\" wide x 33.6\" tall \u25cb Pull out drawer on top (measures 6.3\" tall x 21.3\" long) \u25cb Double door w/ 2 shelves (21.6\" tall x 21.3\" long) \u00a7 Shelf is adjustable \u25cb Bottom of cabinet sits off the floor 3.74\" (leg height) - Nice dark brass hardware (door pull & cabinet pulls) - Variety of uses (bathroom, bedroom, living room, sitting room, entry way)Cons: - Only real issue is MDF - easily scratches/scuffs/chipsI ordered this to have extra storage in my house. I was thinking of using it our laundry room to store our extra bottles of laundry detergent, softner, etc but I might end up using it in the living room to store board games, puzzles etc that the kids frequently use to keep them nice and hidden and organized. The cabinet was pretty easy to put together. It took me about an hour and that was stopping to record and video steps along the way. The gray is a nice neutral color and will go with just about anything. The price point seems to have increased since I ordered this item but still feel that it is a fair price from what you get. I would recommend this product to others.",
