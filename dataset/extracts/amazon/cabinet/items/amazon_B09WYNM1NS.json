After reading some reviews about putting it together, I almost didn\u2019t purchase, but it was rather easy. I did it myself and they included extra pieces. Everything was labeled and instructions were easy to follow. The stickers did leave residue, that is probably the only thing I would say negative about it, they should put the part stickers in an area they won\u2019t show, but an alcohol pad removed the residue. My last 3 purchases before this were very flimsy and not sturdy, so I was pleasantly happy with the product compared to others on the market. True to size and description.",

                "reviewText": "This was trickier than it looked like it would be to assemble. I definitely went and got a better screwdriver because the included one is very difficult to use because the phillips is on the short side. Most early steps were fine, but it is easy to miss the smallest pilot holes that make a difference. The bigger pilot holes are easy to see. The drawers were pretty easy to assemble. The sides have what feel like random holes you have to orient (if they showed the little plastic skid feet it wouldn't be bad to orient it.) I had to take one thing apart, some I had dumb luck in the smallest pilot holes being in the right spot coincidentally. One, the last step, I found a piece backwards so the pilot for the top opening cubby were on the wrong side. Just made new ones because it would have been on much work to undo. These are only the tiny pilot holes that are hard to notice. Pay attention if you buy this to save yourself trouble. Also the drawers are not on hardware, the big one is on felt skids and the small one nothing, in case you are thinking of nicer, smooth pulling drawers. Otherwise I felt it was more sturdy than many flat pack kits (really snug down the screws, which is going to be hard with the provided tool) and serves the intended purpose.",

                "reviewText": "Product seems very sturdy, fairly good weight. Assembly was straight forward with no misalignments or anything. Keep in mind that the instructions are in graphic form. Due to the many parts to assemble, the instructions are not written. It is not put slot A in hole B. You have to think. It is a very detailed, graphic instruction pamphlet. You must take the time to look at the pictures, line up the holes, the orientation. If you do this, there should be no problems. Care must be used when assembling. This is particle board, tho fairly heavy. But being particle board you have to be careful not to over tighten, etc. I had no problems and it is the perfect piece for the space.",

                "reviewText": "I failed to read reviews on this product, because I was so excited that it would fit in my small bathroom, so I might be repeating what others have said. Okay, so.. to start, lock up your pets, put your kids to bed, and open a bottle of wine or beer (whatever you prefer), because HOLY CRAP this thing is a doozy to assemble. There are SO many pieces. Once you get going, it does go together pretty \"easily\" (aka you don't need to be a bodybuilder to get the screws in). It took me an hour and a half to put together. Seems sturdy and I love all the different compartments. I did notice that the white scuffs VERY easily. If you slip while using the screwdriver, it will leave a mark. If you rub it across the floor, it will leave marks. Goodluck and I am not sure I would purchase again, unless I couldn't find anything else that would fit my space.",

                "reviewText": "The sheer number of parts made it intimidating to assemble but the parts were labeled and the instructions had straightforward visual diagrams. Just double and triple check before you screw things together because its easy to make mistakes. I did notice that the paint chipped away pretty easily if you insert the screws with too much force.The only major flaw is that the only thing stopping the cabinet drawers from falling out are a plastic tab which feels kinda flimsy. It also makes the drawer slump downwards when you pull it out. But overall, this cabinet was a good fit for the narrow space between the toilet and wall in the bathroom.",
