The only thing that I would say needs to be improved is the handle for the door, as it seems a bit dainty for the cabinet itself but not a big deal. Installed in one of our rental houses in one of the bathrooms due to it being an older house, and only having smaller medicine cabinets.I am buying 2 more to also install in the same home.",

Boxing and the shape the parts came in were A+, parts came in bag and within that little mini bags - hardware parts labeled A-L, material parts - about 8 of them were numbered.I put it together in less than an hour that passed by quickly. This adds SO much storage than our old school medicine cabinet plus it looks modern, is sturdy and easy to put together.Thanks for being so smart about what you sell, it cleared up my PTSD from a purchase I made last week of a lawn furniture set I bought from amazon.",

Takes up barley any room under the desk but lets me store my taller paint bottles, cleaners and other bits there to help clean up my work bench. Goes together real easy and build quality was far better than I was expecting too. I bought another one for the other corner! Tons of packing foam though, possibly too much as it almost filled a whole garbage bag...",
