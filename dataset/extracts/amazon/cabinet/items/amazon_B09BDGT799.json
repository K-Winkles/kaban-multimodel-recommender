The handles were in the same bag as the screws for her handles and during shipping, the screws scuffed the handles. There were also small dings on the top of the cabinet from shipping/production. I feel that a brand new item shouldn't have any of those. Keep in mind the feet protrude slightly from the rest of the cabinet, so if you are looking for something that can be flush to the wall, this won't be it.",

They are pressed board and as such I don\u2019t expect them to survive forever, but surprisingly heavy and the veneer is well-applied and overall, a great value for the price.
