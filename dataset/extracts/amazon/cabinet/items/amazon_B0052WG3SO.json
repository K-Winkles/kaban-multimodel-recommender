However, the adhesive is strong, so be VERY careful how and where you place it because wherever you place it, it's going to stay there. I placed mine how I though it would be level, but one side is lower by 1/4 inch. My bad. And I can't remove it and place it again.",

The adhesive strips were terrible and the bar fell off the wall the first day even after following all the instructions to ensure they would stick in place. So I went out and purchased 3M \"outdoor\" double sided tape that could be used in wet locations. After the struggle of removing the adhesive strips, it was finally worth all the effort. It stays in place nicely and is a handy little towel bar to have in the shower.",
