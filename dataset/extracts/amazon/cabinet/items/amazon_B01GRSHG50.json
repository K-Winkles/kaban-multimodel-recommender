I intended for this cabinet to store towels and washcloths. It was a little too small for that, so instead we are using it for storing the backup toilet paper supply within easy reach of the toilet and we are putting the towels elsewhere, but we are happy with how that worked out because a larger cabinet would not have fit in the spot and this is a more convenient place to reach for a new roll of TP.",
