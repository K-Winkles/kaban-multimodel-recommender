                "reviewText": "Overall, I would buy it again. It looks really nice and even though the box was very heavy, it's actually quite light once assembled. I recommend two people to move it, but I put it together myself.As far as assembly -- I've put together several Ikea furniture pieces and the cube storage shelves just fine. I would compare this to those, except bigger. However, I've never hung doors/hinges. That was what took the longest and was the hardest. I don't know if it's because of my lower skill level or the doors were not cut perfectly square, but you can see in the picture, the doors are not perfectly square. But again, that might be my fault. The back paneling however was definitely not cut square. Not majorly, but enough that I had to decide if the overhang was going to be at the top or bottom. I obviously chose the overhang to be at the bottom. But once it was all done, you can't tell. It holds a lot of stuff and looks really nice. I take my time during assembly and read directions carefully and enjoy the process and it took me about 3 hours. But I'm sure if you're more focused, you could do it in 2. The hour it says it takes in the directions is based on a 2 person assembly. One person, I'd allow a solid 2 hours. Longer if you've never hung doors before! Lol But it was very well worth it. My boyfriend said our apartment looks like a home now!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this to use as a food pantry in our kitchen. It arrived in a box that was pretty banged up and had me worried, thankfully the internal packaging was pretty good and there was one very minor dent in a place you can't see once it's assembled so not a big deal.Assembly tip:Don't fully tighten the hinges onto the cabinet. A lot of negative reviews on here for the doors not closing because they overlap. This is due to incorrectly tightening the hinge screws during assembly. You should only tighten them mostly to where you can slightly slide them up and down but not fully tightened. This allows you to adjust the door placement so they fit. Then tighten after you get them in place.Pros:-Larger than it appears on the product page-Decently deep shelves-2 adjustable height shelves-Good L shape anchor bracket included, not one of those fabric straps!-All the pre-drilled holes lined up well.-Good quality considering it's made of particle board.-Looks greatCons:-Assembly takes about 2.5 to 3 hours depending if you have help or not.-Uses cam-locks for assumbly and the cams are not pre-installed, you have to screw them in by hand which was tedious.-The doors are flimsy, they suffice but they're bendy and the center cutouts could very easily be damaged or punctured. Not recommended for a household with rowdy kids.-They don't pre-drill the hinge holes on the doors. I had to use a power drill to start the screws and back them out to install the doors onto the hinges.-One of the hinges arrived bent inside undamaged packaging so it was sent that way from the factory. I was able to bend it back to shape.Overall:Assembly wasn't too complicated, just pay attention and look closely at the orientation of pieces on the instructions to save yourself some grief later. Cabinet looks great and will serve it's purpose but don't expect the same quality as if you bought a solid-wood piece of furniture. Stay conscious of what you bought, a mass produced economic piece of furniture.",

Assembling all the parts is very tough job. This product can easily get damaged while fixing it self if you are not very careful, to much delicate. Not at all worth paying this much money.",
