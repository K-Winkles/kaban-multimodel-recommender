The assembly instructions are very descriptive and easy to follow.Appearance wise the cabinet looks great. It is not very sturdy- as in you can feel the door shake a bit when it detaches from the magnet upon opening. Definitely easy to tip so will be securing when we move it to its final home. It comes with a securing set.Pros- great instructions, able to assemble with one person, good appearance.Cons- not super sturdy. Do not over tighten screws as the wood will split. Had one little split when I fist began.Giving it 5 stars as for the price it seems to be good quality.",

Pantry, food, cleaning supplies, paper products, misc.They hold quite a bit and it has given us some great storage.They look nice.These use very thin materials and are not very sturdy, but they are fine for what they are. You have to be gentle with them and they'll be fine. I'm not sure I'd put these in a heavy use part of the house or in a kids playroom. They'd probably rip the doors right off.The shelves are sturdy though. It's just the doors and sides that are thin.Assembly was straight forward.I'd consider getting more if they pop up again around $100. I wouldn't mind paying a little more for a heavier duty version with thicker materials.",

I kept getting alerted it was coming for over a week and had been alerted to request a refund or a new item the day it showed up. Luckily it came! I was looking for pictures of the inside but couldn\u2019t find any with BOTH doors opened. So in the instructions you MUST build the top shelf AND the middle divider shelf which isn\u2019t shown in the product pictures as they only show one door open at either time which is misleading. I bought it just for storing random stuff for outside like sunscreen and dog cookies and our vacuum and mop and broom. We have no linen closets and a tri level house so storage is awkward for stuff like this that we need everyday but don\u2019t want just sitting out. Luckily this *just* fit our first generation DYSON vacuum on one side and our mop broom and bucket on the other. What you see it with is the bare minimum of what must be built. You HAVE to have the top shelf and you HAVE to have the divider shelf or it won\u2019t be stable. It also look AMAZING and we\u2019ve got a lot of compliments on how modern and stylish it is. It\u2019s not the sturdiest thing in the world but sturdy enough for what we are using it for. It did have extra shelves but we didn\u2019t need them so we just stored them for later. Would be great for a pantry and works awesome as a closet for vacuum and other cleaning tools. Definitely a two person job as well. I usually build all our stuff alone and actually needed my husbands help for this. Instructions are a little complex, having 3-4 steps under each heading so make sure you read it carefully especially as not everything was labeled. Also the back is cheap cardboard and the screw covers came with what essentially are stickers so we didn\u2019t apply them. We plan on building a seating bench by our table to match it and we will cover the screw holes up then. Love that is thin enough to not make a huge footprint but big enough to hold large items.",

I noticed it is manufactured in Thailand? Nice job on them too.",

The sides are such thin material; maybe 1/8\". The particle board is a poor quality and the screws don't even find purchase because once they reach the end they just keep spinning. There are no cam lock nuts or screws because the material is so cheap and thin they couldn't be bothered. The shelves themselves don't even fit properly. Hope this doesn't fall apart in 2 weeks. Dot stickers to cover screws. Just cheap. Not for kitchen use but not sturdy enough for anything but food.",
