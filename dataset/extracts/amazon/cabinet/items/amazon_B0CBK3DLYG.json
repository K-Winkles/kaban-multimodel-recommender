                "reviewText": "Hard to assemble, but looked beautiful when it was done. Organizes shoes well (you can actually keep 6 pairs of adult shoes in each unit). We got two shoe storage units and placed them side by side and it looks really pretty in our mudroom. The white wood is clean and modern and the handle looks nice. The issue is the cushions move around, but our shoe racks are backed against the wall, so it\u2019s not a big deal. We were happy for the first few months and were pretty gentle opening/closing the door, BUT after 3 months of use, one of the shoe racks fell apart and can\u2019t be fixed- a screw came out and the whole screw track within the wood is destroyed. I tried to fix it but it\u2019s a few millimeters off since the hole is bigger and now the door doesn\u2019t open and close properly. It\u2019s a shame that we only got 3 months out of it for that price.",

                "reviewText": "Update: several months later, we're updating this review to add a star \u2014 because although this shoe cabinet was arduous and extremely frustrating to assemble, once we figured out how to put it together, the cabinet has served well to declutter our foyer. Several months later, the cabinet is still in good working order after being used several times daily. We love how it freed up space in our foyer and we like the way it blends in with white doors and door trim. The organizational configuration served to streamline and simplify our shoe removal and organization process. We have greater appreciation for this shoe cabinet since adding undercabinet lighting, as shown in our review images. We also swapped out the cheaper handles for copper handles. And we added contact paper inside, making it easier to clean when the shoe soles are dirty.Originally, we'd complained that there are soooo many pieces and parts to assemble this MDF flip-drawer shoe cabinet. The installation instructions are absolutely horrible and impossible to understand. The tiny font is difficult to see, as are the tiny icons used in the instructions. It took two college-educated senior citizens two hours to assemble the two-drawer shoe cabinet, using a Phillips head screwdriver and lots of patience. Fortunately, one of us is a carpenter\u2019s daughter, so we figured it out on our own. During the assembly process, we discovered several flaws in the design and manufacturing (incompletely pre-drilled holes; gaps in alignment of panels and rails). As shown in our images, we did not use the drawer handles provided; we substituted with our own leather handles. We are happy we were able to put this together because we do like how this shoe cabinet helped to declutter our foyer. Now we can find our shoes quickly and no one\u2019s tripping over them strewn around the door anymore. (TIP: We added magnetic, motion-sensor light bars to the interior undersides.)",
