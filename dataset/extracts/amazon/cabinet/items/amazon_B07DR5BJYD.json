This took a minute to build, but was overall really simple. I feel like it is well made. The only thing about it is that it rocks a little at the top, but it doesn't seem like it's going to collapse. It is also much deeper than I thought it would be, which is great. I'm very pleased and I would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I love the cabinet. I purchased the fluted door style to use in a bedroom.This product is well packed, but as the info states, is heavy. My UPS driver is awesome and actually brought it in the house for me. Use great caution when opening, as it is tightly packed. Open it at the long side and the ends.The directions are pretty straightforward, except as others stated, installing the hinges.My suggestion is to NOT take the hinges apart as the directions tell you, but rather install them on the door first and have help balancing them to install on the cabinet. I followed the directions on the hinge installation, but was unable to slide them into the matching piece. There are 3 hinges. I reassembled the hinges and mounted them on the door first and installed them to the cabinet by myself. Hint: don\u2019t tighten all the mounting screws the whole way until you have all three hinges started.The comments on the door not matching up are likely from people unfamiliar with euro hinges. They are fully adjustable to tweak the gap.I do agree the top of of the side panels should have been finished to avoid snags and moisture entering. It is nice that the legs are adjustable and allows air circulation. There is a chemical smell after the door is on, but I\u2019m sure that will dissipate.You definitely want to use the wall mount hardware with this cabinet due to its narrow depth and width.Overall, I would purchase this again. Pretty cabinet.",

Do not drop or use power tools. Be gentle.I did have to add some L supports to the top and bottom to this specific standing shelf because it has no support to prevent from leaning either side.The no slam doors are cool but extremely difficult to assemble.The instructions are garbage.Missing a majority of the assigned screws per peice.It will work for a little while. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a piece that will hold up for a long term befor it comes crashing down or falls apart. This particle board is like dust.

                "reviewText": "I bought this because it was one of the only ones available with built in adjustable feet since I am putting this in a laundry room, I didn't want it to sit directly on the floor. I looked at adding feet to other models from Home Depot or Lowes and the cost added up very quickly. I was a little nervous about ordering something this size from amazon. Both this one and the other 24in arrived with no signs of abuse. It was fairly easy to put together. I took wood glue and added it to all the connection places. You don't need to do this but it cant hurt, right. The hardware looks nice and I love the soft close doors. Some have complained about alignment. I had no issues with that. I was careful to level the base when I installed it and also to make sure it was square when I put it together. It took about 1 hour from start to finish. Another nice thing about this is the clip on doors. The hinges are installed in two pieces. Install the hinge to the door and the base to the wall of the cabinet. THen simply click the two together. This made the door assembly really fast and easy to do. Usually you have to hold the door and try to screw in the base while the door is hanging in the air.It came with movable shelves. I did not want any shelves so I took one of them and turned it vertical and screwed it flush with the back about 5 feet high. Then drilled a hole for the Dyson cord and installed the Dyson hand held holder. Works perfectly.There is a permanently installed shelf that is about 15 inches down. This shelf is designed to keep the sides from bowing out over time Keep this in mind if you have any really large brooms or handled items. They may not fit.Overall I am very happy with this one and the 24\" double door I bought with this.",
