                "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitant to buy this because I've had previous cube style connected shelves and they were always falling apart. I chose this shoe storage rack over those options, however, because it fits way more pairs than other, more expensive shoe storage solutions.For the price point it is fantastic and I am very pleasantly surprised! I got the the white with cloudy doors. This works great for me because I don't see a bunch of clutter from far away, but I can still generally tell which shoes are where without having to open every door. It's surprisingly sturdy, and I am able to use the hooks included to hang my mop & broom in my little apartment.As far as assembly, it took a bit of time and patience. They include a cute little hammer that I kept for future projects, but they don't really detail what/where to hammer. Instructions are pretty vague. I found that going in the order of the directions, I couldn't get the doors to fit in place, and it felt like I was going to break something when I tried to do it their way. This also resulted in me using too much force and parts that I had already finished would come apart and I kept hurting my fingers. So, I ended up connecting the doors to the large flat pieces first thing, and connecting the rest of the walls after that, and it ended up working out fine. There is a very satisfying click when the pieces go fully into place.As far as use, its fantastic! I can fit literally all of my shoes in it, as well as my socks and belts. Each compartment is very spacious and even my Ugg boots fit when I lay them down like they would be in a shoe box.I highly recommend this shoe rack and am very happy with my purchase!",

I disassembled and started over. This time I secured every single connector at three places with 5\u201d zip ties. I will cut off the excess zip tie- 5\u201d white zip ties is preferable) Photo taken prior to cutting excess zip tie length.After much frustration, I am pleased with this product. Using these suggestions will save you hours of headaches!Pros: High quality materials, ample storage, flip up flaps, a clean look.",

Segundo punto: en las fotos el material se ve como pl\u00e1stico s\u00f3lido y resulta que es m\u00e1s bien como un tipo pel\u00edcula o filamento, por lo tanto no durar\u00e1 mucho.
