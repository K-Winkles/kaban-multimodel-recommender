Assembly took about 3 hours by myself.Price is very reasonable, and I like that I can remove the middle shelf inside the cabinets for more height, which now stores a lot of my tools for when I cook and don\u2019t have to have it all out in display looking cluttered. The wood illusion seems to scratch very easily, edges came faded out a bit but I\u2019m not too picky, overall colors are very pretty and warm.The doors for the cabinets may have been user error on my part as they are not aligned but no biggie. Overall 10/10:), aesthetically pleasing , great storage, easy to follow instructions!",

It took me 2 hours to put together but that\u2019s just me as I like to put it together correctly. The cabinet itself is great, except the brown top was scratched on the under side and it looks like someone put brown stain over it to cover it up. The very top of the brown top is dinged in a few spots, maybe due to careless people. Overall, it\u2019s a good cabinet, just will have to live with the dings. Pretty easy to put together as the instructions were good.",

It took 2 hours to put one together (by myself) but directions were easy to follow so just take your time. I was worried about it being junk but the only flimsy parts were the back and the bottom of the drawers. The back came with plastic wedges that screwed in to tighten the back so that helped (I wish the drawers had them too). I considered looking for some next time I\u2019m at a hardware store and maybe caulking the bottoms just for added support. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I loved this piece so much I bought a second one for my small dining area too!
