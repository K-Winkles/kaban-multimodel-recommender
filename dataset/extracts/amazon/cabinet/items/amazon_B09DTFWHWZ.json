I did that, wasn't any issue, however this could have easily have been done at the source. Be very careful if deciding to go with the left hand hinge. Pre-drill the holes needed and careful not to shoot all the way through the cabinet wall. A 1/16 th. bit will be adequate for the holes needed. (Install the hinges on the door first) Mark the hinge holes on the cabinet wall Then install two screws for each hinge at the adjustment hinge holes and fit to the cabinet, mark your holes, drill out and install the door. Then do the remaining four screws while doing the door adjustments.",
