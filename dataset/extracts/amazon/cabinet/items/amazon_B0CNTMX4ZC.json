After having to step back by the sheer number of pieces, the instructions were awesome and I had no problem with the assembly. Fully built, it looks great and feels very solid. I had a bit of concern about gaps in the doors, but reached out to the seller and got a quick and easy response that allowed me to adjust them. Definitely would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "For a piece of furniture that needs to be assembled, this is about as good as it gets. The packaging and instructions were very well thought out. I loved that the parts were divided into their own individually lettered bag. Each letter was displayed on the instruction booklet which made it easy to understand exactly which part goes where. A philips screwdriver was included as well as an extra bag of spare parts (just in case!). Personally, I chose to use a cordless screwdriver but for those who don't own one, the included philips would be very helpful. The boards pre-drilled holes matched up perfectly with each other. I'm very impressed by the amount of thought, consideration and planning that went into this piece. I whole heartedly recommend this sideboard.",
