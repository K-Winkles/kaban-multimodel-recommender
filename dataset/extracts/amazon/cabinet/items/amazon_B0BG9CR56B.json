The multipurpose storage solution provides ample space to display and organize books, games, and arts and crafts supplies. Make playtime more manageable with displays of developmentally appropriate toys; rearrange play spaces with too many options. Use this toy rotation storage to bring excitement back as playthings are refreshed. Designed to grow with little ones, this organizer helps parents, teachers, and educators keep small items off the floor and within reach. The low-profile open-face shelves encourage children to select their favorite activity independently and introduce organizational skills and clean up when playtime is over. Four casters are included for mobility; move the book display from a reading space to a craft room. Constructed from sustainably harvested birch plywood with a tough UV lacquer that seals the wood surface and resists scratching. A UV inhibitor makes furniture resistant to ultraviolet light and yellowing. Natural birch plywood is durable and designed for everyday use in a commercial or institutional environment, and great for the home. The natural grain complements any space. Combine the Montessori storage with ECR4Kids Birch Collection furniture pieces to complete the space; sold separately.",

Students develop confidence and responsibility with tasks that allow children to control their environment, like putting away their coats, bags, and personal items in designated places. Organizational Skills Keep small pieces contained and rooms clutter free so that children can focus on tasks. Neatly store bags, coats, and personal items within reach. Use organizing storage units to help teach responsibility and make clean up a breeze. Child Size Create an interactive that is space built to scale for little learners. Proportionally sized items promote confidence and independence. Little ones take ownership of their learning as they navigate a kid-sized environment. Daily Routine Create smooth transitions with predictable daily routines. When students have a designated locker or cubby space for their belongings, they can move independently and confidently between tasks in the classroom. Give children a place to keep personal items so that their daily routines support an organized and focused learning environment.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE these shelves. I love that the 24\" comes exactly to the height of the window sills in my 1908 house. I love that they are made of solid, laminated birch and that the laminations are so beautifully done, they look like art, not plywood. I love that the shelves have low casters, hidden under a bottom skirt, so that even when full they move smoothly and easily when Christmas comes and we want to put the tree in front of a window. I love that they hold a lot, that the light finish is durable & lasting, that you would never in a million years suspect these of being classroom furniture, yet they cost far less than a comparable \"proper\" living room bookshelf would cost.The only extra work they take is the removal of the wood-burned logo in the center of the bottom skirt. I don't like logo wear anywhere, and especially not on my furniture, so before assembly, I simply take a little time to lightly hand-sand the area until the wood-burned design is gone. Adds maybe 10-15 work to the total, but they go together so easily, even the extra work doesn't make assembly a big deal.There are two of these in my living room, now, and I have other areas in the house where I'd like to replace cheaper and/or chunkier shelves, or totally different pieces of furniture, with more of these. They're just so pretty, and so practical, why wouldn't I?",

The height is perfect and he's able to get his toys in and out of the shelve safely. The corners are also safe. They give the feeling of school quality due to the safety standards.

                "reviewText": "I have no complaints except the instructions aren't the clearest. These shelves are solid, were easy for me to put together alone (once divider orientation was figured out), and are great in the nursery. They hold lots of items, especially with organizer baskets, and aren't a big risk of tipping due to the shorter height of 24\" and a base depth of 13\". They also seem to hold up so far to my kiddo banging his toys all over them. I chose not to use the casters, as my kid would just skate the shelves around the room if I did.The instructions are lacking. If you want pictures that demonstrate proper orientation, you will not get it. Step 1, the top divider goes onto the side with only 1 set of holes and the screws go into the bottom side where there are 3 sets of holes (two sets with plastic inserts). The slots in the wood need to all face to the back to hold the back panels, so watch your orientation with that as well. This is not clearly indicated in the pictures. It's easy to figure out if you have had to build a lot of pack flat furniture, but it may lose some people who haven't.Do not over tighten the pins that go in the plastic inserts, this can cause them to angle oddly, and then that can pull the plastic out when you go to put the pins in the dividers. It didn't happen with these for me, but it's happened with similar designs in the past, and I have seen review pictures where it looked like that had happened on these shelves.Over all, I have 3 of these and love them so far. If I needed more storage space, I wouldn't hesitate getting more. These beat those easily scratchable melamine laminate units, and easily chipable particle board units, any day of the week.",

Building it was a little challenging as one of the parts was a little wonky (literally the only reason I deducted a star), but with a little help from my husband we were able to make it work. Obviously, don\u2019t overdo it on screwing the screws in too tight, as there\u2019s a risk of splitting the wood like with all wooden furniture. We had no issues with this and made sure not to overdo it. The shelf itself is solid and beautiful. I didn\u2019t use the canisters and have it flat on our carpet. My daughter loves having her toys on display and that she\u2019s able to reach them all. Really pleased with this purchase, and for such a reasonable price. Much sturdier than an IKEA piece, that\u2019s for sure!",
