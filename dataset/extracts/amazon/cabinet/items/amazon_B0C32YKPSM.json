Thick plastic/PVC material that doesn\u2019t flex or feel like it will snap off.Easy to assemble (only the height of 3 worked in my cabinet due to my miscalculation). Holds hydroflask well but you will need to flip the bottle top handles upright. Take measurements to make sure it gives you the fit you want if using in a cabinet.I\u2019m very happy with this solution to water bottle storage allowing easy access and organization without accidentally knocking over one bottle (no more domino effect in the cabinet, oops.)",

                "reviewText": "We were able to assemble two stacks of two with this 4 pack. We are using them to stack shaker bottles and sports water bottles. My husband loved that he is able to easily see and grab what he needs out of the cabinet now. It is also easier to put the bottles away and store between uses. Only complaint would be that some of the shaker bottles do not fit easily due to the lid size being larger than the actual bottle. It does not bother us due to the great price!",
