                "reviewText": "Update after 3rd one:The first 2 arrived with damage boxes but the parts were not damaged. The 3rd cabinet had two prices that where bent in the large box (it comes in 2 boxes). It was mishandled badly during shipping because the factory packaging was all done correctly.The seller\u2019s customer support was GREAT! They always got back within same day or 24 hours.I contacted them before fully unpacking because I didn\u2019t know if they would want it returned and there was no way I could repackage it once it was all out. They said to go ahead and unpack it and that I would not need to return it if it was damaged.I sent them plenty of pictures of the unpacking process to show it was damaged upon receipt. They sent an entire new big box of parts. Sadly, it also had a few damaged parts but I was able to use pieces from both boxes to get a while I damaged cabinet.After having these 3 for a few months, they are great. I love the wheels, reinforced shelving, color and locking doors. I could not find all features on any cabinets at my local stores.I would but a forth if needed!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original review:Just put it together and will order a few more. The packing was well done and there were no dents on panels. This was my biggest concern but they\u2019ve done a good job designing the packing. There are even metal corner protectors on each box corner and it comes in two boxes.",

Note, however, that one of the door pins was defective and an alternative need to be rigged. Also, note that the caster plates had to fit in under the side wall bottom flanges in order to be seated correctly - This part had to be pryed out slightly with a screwdriver to accomplish this. But overall, we are very pleased with these cabinets. The fabrication is very good, and they were well-packaged for shipment.",

I don\u2019t have a specific cleaning closet in my home. Almost every other cabinet I looked at had a permanent shelf right in the middle and you couldn\u2019t put tall items like vacuums in them. This one has all shelves that are adjustable. I ended up putting two shelves in each one, high enough so my vacuums would fit under the shelves.I ordered two of these. They came super quickly. They both arrived in perfect condition! They were packed super well. My husband and I put them together fairly quickly. Very high quality and I have nothing bad to say about them at all. I put them in my garage and so glad I went with these since they have casters as well!",
