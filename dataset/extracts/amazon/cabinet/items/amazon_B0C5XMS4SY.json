                "reviewText": "I had to really think about how i was going to write this review as the FedEx delivery was a nightmare! I had ordered a different cabinet, but it was too big so i returned it and ordered this one. The tracking info said this cabinet was delivered, but when I got home, I found that FedEx delivered the first cabinet to me again, and a call to FedEx told me that they sent this cabinet back to the company of the first cabinet!!! What? After some communication with Leo with this company, he quickly sent out a replacement! Unfortunately, it arrived damaged by FedEx. After saying all that, Leo with Airiva was wonderful to work with! Not only did he send me a whole new replacement cabinet, but he also sent the part that was damaged!!! Now for the cabinet: This cabinet is small, but it holds more than it looks. It took a few hours to put together, but the instructions were easy to follow. The drawers have metal glides that move very easily. The drawers are perfect for holding rolls of wax paper, tin foil, sandwich bags etc. The only thing I don't really like is that the doors aren't deep enough to hold much more than bottles of spices. Maybe, if the dowel rods were smaller, they might hold more. The doors swing easily. You have to make sure that the back board is on straight to make sure the doors line up properly. Overall, very nice cabinet. It has kind of a funky smell, but I expect that will go away with time. Very, very good customer service from Leo with Airiva and fantastic customer service from Amazon over refund from the first cabinet that was lost!",

The instructions were clear, the drawings had details, and it used words when necessary.2. There was plenty of packaging in the box to protect the boards. Everything was well labeled, even the bags of hardware.3. It came with a screwdriver! No Allen wrench in sight!3. The holes all lined up! No jamming things together!4. The cabinet was sturdy after assembly and came with cutouts on the backing for anchoring, and came with the anchoring components.The one downside I notice right off the bat is it has a noticeable chemical smell out of the box. I\u2019m hoping it dissipates out in the open but will wipe it down with a vinegar solution if it remains.I\u2019m very happy with my purchase!",
