Styrafoam everywhere, between each piece, foam wrap, heavy cardboard reinforcements on each corner ..... I'm truly impressed. I haven't counted the hardware, but the packaging is flawless.

                "reviewText": "I bought this nice cabinet for laundry product storage. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too short to accommodate more than one shelf because the products are tall. The packaging was outstanding on this item. All of the pieces were well-protected by foam and padded sheets, and labeled according to the assembly instructions.. The connecting parts were also labeled and in a compartmentalized package. There was even a little bag labeled \u201cextra parts\u201d. Amazing. The assembly instructions were superb and written by someone who actually speaks English! Step-by-step instructions with diagrams were awesome. The composite pieces are heavy and well-constructed. You DO need two people to assemble, as recommended. The parts are sturdy/bulky and hard to balance by yourself.Two things affect my rating of this otherwise lovely cabinet. First, the back is made of cheap cardboard. This really surprised me, considering the quality of the rest of the unit. The first time I would accidentally hit it with a detergent bottle, I\u2019m sure it would punch out. I had to buy two wooden sheets to replace the two cardboard ($40). Second, the finish has already started rubbing off on the corners. I have no clue how extreme this will become but I will have to keep some white touch-up paint at the ready, Otherwise, this is a small, sturdy cabinet that is easily tucked into a corner and looks pretty.",

You can't convince me these were my fault! Oh - and there are paint runs in the finish. Stick with the Big Name Brands! I would send it back, except it was delivered by USPS (don't get me going on that!) and it's a very big hassle for me to return it after the packaging has been opened.",
