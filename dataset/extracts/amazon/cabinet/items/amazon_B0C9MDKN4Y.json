                "reviewText": "This is the only shelf I could find that was narrow enough to fit into my small bathroom. Pay attention to the dimensions given, because they are accurate.Some reviews said that this shelf was hard to put together, but I'm not mechanically inclined at all and I had no problem whatsoever. Look carefully at the pictures and make sure your pieces are facing the right way as you put it together. Yes, it took about two hours to put together, but that's why it's so sturdy.I think this shelf is just beautiful. It's a very clean white color. You could use Dollar Tree removable stickers to decorate it if you wanted to. It's very visually appealing.The shelves are too small to hold much, but they will hold little items that take up a lot of room like deodorant, body spray, soap, washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, etc. The shelves are also easily adjustable, and you could even do without some of the shelves if desired.The shelf stands very stable, but they make it very easy to anchor it to the wall. I didn't see the need for this since I don't have kids, but it's very easy to do and will insure that it doesn't fall over.In short, this was well worth the money. All of my friends have said, \"Omg, where did you get this shelf.\" lol It's very cute as well as being a life saver for small spaces. It's also very versatile. I would love to have one of these in every room and not just the bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "It takes awhile to put together and using your common sense is easier than looking at the instructions. It's like putting together a puzzle, and it gets easier once it's started. Fitting the door on properly took a little adjusting, but it works good once finished. I opted to leave the top door off and it allows easier access to what I need, but you can adjust it however you like to fit your needs. It is tall and I put mine in a corner which supports it well. If you don't have a corner spot for it, then it comes with hardware to mount it to the wall as well. It's a great cabinet for small items in a small space, and I recommend it very much. Just have patience putting it together and it will be a fun little project.",

                "reviewText": "Love the cabinet. Was a little bit challenging to assemble because pics were very small and made it hard to read what screw size went where. There are no written directions for assembly. However, it can be figured out. I skipped the one I couldn't figure out and did a couple steps ahead which then allowed me to go back and do the section I skipped over.I wish the small shelves in the center section (not in the cupboards) were interchangeable with the ones in the cupboards. They are two different sizes. It would allow for more cupboard usage in the space allowed. Or add in two more cupboard shelves. So there are two in each section instead of one. Love the style of the look overall.PS: it will need to be anchored to the wall. If a child bumps into it, has potential to tip-over due to how tall it is.",

All of the others came complete with hardware and tools clearly marked and packaged individually. This hardware packaging was just plain stupid, some packs had multiple different parts in no rational order (see photo).The same was true of the assembly instructions. Simple things like you don't put on the door knob before you attach the door (with tiny screws), that needs to lie flat to make holes line-up.I will never buy another Haotian SoBuy product. It's cute, but not worth the effort.It is 1/2 assembled . . . I'm not sure if I'll finish it or just return it. I'll update later.Feb 9, 2023 UPDATE -Cabinet is together . . . as you can see in the 3rd photo there is an entire pack of extra pieces!!! After much review, I did find where they were intended to be placed . . . except THERE ARE NO HOLES FOR THE SCREWS!!!!!I had given it 3 stars to start, but would give it ZERO STARS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!",
