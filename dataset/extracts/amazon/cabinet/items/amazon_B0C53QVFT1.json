                "reviewText": "LOVE THIS PIECE!!!! I have always hated my trash & recycling cans sitting out in sight. Being in a tight reno budget, I went hunting for something in my price range. And Bingo! Here it is. Some have stated it was difficult/time consuming to assemble. I was able to assemble mine in about 2-hours. The instructions could be a bit \u201cmuddled\u201d at times but fairly straightforward. Please ignore the clutter around the cabinet. The kitchen is currently a work in progress.",
