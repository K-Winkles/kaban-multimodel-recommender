I can fit many things inside it, my sink is completely empty except for hand soap.I also want to mention the color. Evan tho it doesn\u2019t match with anything in the toilet, but as a standalone cabinet it\u2019s looks very nice.Also craftsmanship of this cabinet is amazing. Very strongly made, but it\u2019s incredibly light.",

It arrived quickly, was well packaged, all the parts were included and the instructions were clear. The reason for less stars is that the holes were not drilled on the back or to attach the door hinges. I had to drill them out myself. I wanted the door to open from the right so was able to drill holes on the opposite side. It worked out for me but if I didn\u2019t have a power drill I would\u2019ve returned it.",

                "reviewText": "I am not experienced at assembly but decided to tackle this and had it done pretty fast! Checked to make sure I had all the parts and always afraid I'll be missing screws or hardware but it was all there, didnt count each screw but no extras so don't lose anything! I got the gray because it was less expensive and I think I'll probably paint it to match the dark gray vanity it's sitting on top of that's upside down and not installed yet, and maybe change the knob. It's a pretty light/medium gray though. It's cute and just the right size to fit over the new toilet once it's installed, it's a very small bathroom so the majority of them are too large. This is about the same width as a toilet tank. It's very hard to find any of these pre-assembled or in a store. I considered putting a couple open shelves in the space instead but they're hard to keep things looking neat and I prefer toiletries to be behind a closed door. I wish my bathroom was just a guest powder room that would get little use but not the case. If you need something like this I highly recommend it.Update, I painted it. It doesn't match exactly in daylight but the bathroom it will be in has no windows. You can tell it's painted, added a couple photos. I also ordered new matching acrylic and satin nickel door pulls for the vanity and cabinet.EDIT: I had such a great experience with the gray one I bought the white one on sale and it's missing holes in the back to attach the back, the top and bottom won't go all the way on (could not screw cam bolts all the way in), it's missing two screws for part 5 the rear cross bar which are not even in the instructions but they're on the gray one and there are holes for them. I was almost done putting it together when I gave up. I packed it back up and processed a return, did not want to deal with it anymore. If I could've gotten the cam bolts screwed in all the way it probably would've come together OK but there wasn't hardware to fill in the holes on the crossbar and the back was hard to screw in also, although do-able.Pros are it's small, good price and looks nice in a small space, Cons are assembly is hit or miss depending on the parts you get, and it only opens in one direction. You could make it open the other way if you drill your own holes directly opposite where they are now and reverse where you attach the hinges and magnetic closure.",
