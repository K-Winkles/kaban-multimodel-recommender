                "reviewText": "For the price, it was decent quality. My only complaint is that the screws to put the door knobs on are too short. Hence why the picture only has one knob on. We have to go out and purchase a slightly longer screw as the screw would not tread the knob on the one side.I also am not a huge fan of the fact that you can see the screw heads on the side of the table. It makes it look cheaper. There should be screw caps to cover the screws.",
