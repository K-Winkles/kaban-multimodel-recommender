Really easy to assemble as pieces connect easily and door hinges and magnetic latch are already installed and lined up perfectly. The piece has a LOT more room inside than you would think. It's fairly bottom-heavy so we did not use wall anchors (even though it came with them) and it's really even and sturdy, no wobbling at all.I know this piece seems like it would be suited for a bathroom or laundry room. But my dining area needed a corner cabinet that matches my white cupboards. However, I wanted to keep the paintings on the wall so I opted for this instead of a tall cabinet. I think it looks great and I'll likely order more items from this manufacturer. THE ONLY tool we needed was a Phillips screw driver.",

                "reviewText": "I got this on sale for $88 and it is absolutely worth it at that price. Very easy to assemble, clear instructions, and took me about one hour while having constant interruptions with other things. Very sturdy and roomy inside for being a corner cabinet. I included a pic of a tissue box so you can see the top has a good amount of space to put things on. The details are very nice and look good. Solid wood all the way around. None of that cheap cardboard backs like some furniture. I don\u2019t think I would pay the full list price for it, because it arrived with a small chip on the top front, and the hardware holes are very visible on the sides of the cabinet (you get white circular stickers to cover them, whereas wood plugs would have looked nicer). I\u2019ll just put a little touch up paint on the chip and it\u2019ll look perfect. I would totally 100% recommend to anyone looking for a solid piece of furniture.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying this was the second one I had ordered, as the first one came in damaged this was the replacement. This one had a crack in the shelf that goes inside the unit. Assembly was awful as the cams are way too small for the holes and shifted or flat out fell out every time you tried to move it in any way. This also caused the damage to the front leg as the cam fell out while turning and caused the cam screw to go through and crack the leg. It came with these very thin little while dot stickers which I assume was to cover the metal of the cams but at this point I am beginning to think that it's more useful to hold the cams in! You can see by one of the pics that the cams are all uneven under the stickers. The day before I assembled a cabinet twice the size with multiple drawers and shelves as well as a ton of cams and it all went together super easy. This one did not. I am only keeping it now as it is assembled and I do not want to have to disassemble again to send back and I need something for the kids room right now. But in general, do not waste your money. This might have been worth $30 but def not $100.",
