If the door is opened to the fully open position the cabinet pulls apart and becomes rickety, see photos. WHAT THE H**L??!! I spent 30 minutes of my time assembling this storage cabinet and I want to actually store things in it. If I can not open the door, how am I supposed to get anything in it? Total waste of my time, money and effort!",
