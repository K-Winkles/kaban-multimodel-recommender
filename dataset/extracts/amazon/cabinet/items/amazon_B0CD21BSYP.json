                "reviewText": "Previously I had the typical shoe cabinet and wanted something more elegant and not clunky looking to store my shoes. I found this option and it was basically the same dimensions as my shoe rack but looked a lot nicer. The top shelves are handy for storage or putting misc things on. The cabinets are easy to open however it is limited on the type of shoe that can fit and how many can fit. The description says up to 12 shoes but they need to be 12 small shoes. My usual shoes fit and only fit about 9 of them. Of course boots would not fit but mainly the tennis shoes. It was pretty easy to assemble however some of the screws were really small. They give you a small screw driver but if you have a drill its definitely easy and quicker. I love the cabinet and would recommend the buy",
