Be careful, the wood is quite soft so it's easy to strip the wood if you use a power drill for the screws. You do need to use a drill, just don't go too fast with it, and don't tighten the screws with the drill -- tighten them with a screwdriver. It looks fabulous and fits exactly where I wanted it. Dust with only a microfiber cloth, dampened if necessary. DO NOT USE SPRAY FURNITURE POLISH OR RISK LOSING THE BEAUTIFUL SHINY PLOLISH. Very happy with this unit.",

                "reviewText": "It looks amazing and is extremely sturdy, but this thing took forever to put together. I'm talking well over four hours including snack breaks!! I assembled it alone and no individual step was difficult, but it was hands down the most involved and time consuming assembly of any piece of furniture I have ever purchased. I really think that it is a matter of the manufacturer designing a product to be quality and sturdy over having it be easy to put together.The instructions were very clear. All pieces came nicely labeled. They put arrows pointing toward the front for all pieces where you had to decide how to orient them. They even included drill holes at the top and bottom of the doors so that it doesn't matter which door you put on the left and which one you put on the right. Either way you can put the magnet at the bottom to connect to the magnet on the bottom of the inside to hold it closed.Without the drawers in it or doors on it, it was light enough for me, a relative weakling, to pick up on my own and move to its final spot. The only time that an extra pair of hands would have been nice was when having to support the doors to connect the hinges to the main body of the sideboard.Again, every individual step is easy enough, but people who just have average modular furniture assembly skills could find this to be a really daunting. Overall, I'm relieved to be done and extremely satisfied with the final product. Extremely well designed. Would buy another piece of furniture from this manufacturer without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "This buffet IS beautiful, but at this time I cannot give it a good rating. Multiple pieces arrived damaged, including one of the preassembled tracks for the drawers, which was bent outward, leaving me unable to insert a drawer in one spot. Additionally, there is visible damage on the top, on of the drawers, and the bottom piece which is really the foundation for the entire cabinet has a huge crack in two places.I contacted the company for replacement parts, and was told they were on back order. My options were to refund/return, keep as is with a partial refund, or wait 3 - 4 months for parts. I'm taking a gamble and waiting the 3 - 4 months for the back ordered parts in hopes that they arrive undamaged, and if I'm easily able to replace everything I will come back and update my review. For as much as this item costs, I should not have to go through this trouble. The fact that this was a gift for our daughter added insult to injury.SimpliHome does not seem to place a lot of value in quality control. Customers should NOT have to go through this hassle.4/5/22 UPDATE: SimpliHome has reached out to say that they have not yet received the back ordered parts, and wants to send me $85 as a 'discount' ... I don't think they understand that I spent more than $600 for a piece of furniture that is going to fall apart as soon as we start to use it because of the damages to the foundation of the cabinet, and an empty hole where a drawer should be because the track is bent. For that kind of money, this item should be in perfect condition, and this offer is unacceptable. I see others here who received this buffet in perfect (or near perfect) condition. SimpliHome can make this right by 1.) finding my replacement parts or 2.) send me a new cabinet or 3.) refund my purchase. I will follow up once I know what their decision is. In the meantime, THANKS SimpliHome for turning what should have been an awesome gift for my daughter into an expensive nightmare.",

My husband is very handy and knew that he followed the instructions perfectly. We ended up taking the top off and were able to get the upright boards to slip into place which fixed the problem. I am using it as a coffee bar and it holds everything we need plus more. Great storage and very solid piece of furniture. I love it.",
