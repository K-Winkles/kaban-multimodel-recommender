                "reviewText": "The main issue is that the shelves aren't correctly aligned, so the painted/smooth edge that should be facing outward doesn't fit properly due to the sizing (not perfect squares). The shelves fit but the unfinished edges had to be outward on 2/4 of them. So if it doesn't fit for you then that's possible the reason and just turning them should semi-resolve it.Assembly is very simple and straightforward. However, the other issue is that once it's complete, is it really a cabinet worth the asking price? It is on the basic side and it's not really made of anything premium or engineered in a fancy way. You kind of have to do everything that you do perfectly right within its own level of quality to justify the value and that's not really here.If it was more competitive and they fixed the (already known issue to them) then they'd have an easy winner. But with more options out there it's hard to recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Quality is not that amazing for the price. Multiple corners were poorly connected and paint was chipping off slightly from the edges.It was a challenge assembling because the last 2 piece could not fit. I had to just leave it how it was because the instructions were not clear. If I pushed the last 2 flat pieces in, it would've broken the entire thing.Overall, it's not bad if you wanted to store a larger size stuff in a standing position without attaching the shelves. Also, it doesn't seem too reliable so I won't recommend adding heavy stuff to it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very disappointed in this unit. I'll have to use it until I can replace, but the shelves \"E\" are cut too large. We had to force them in, resulting in an obviously bowed look! I'm not happy at all with this. Especially for the listing price of this item (currently $139; but was $179 at the time I ordered) the quality need huge improvement. I planned to replace the feet before the cabinet was even built, yes they are adjustable but they are CHEAP looking. Aside of the obvious; the door is very thin and easy to manipulate. It does hold a lot, and we made it usable, but that's about all the good I can say about it. I would not purchase this item again and suggest to keep looking.",
