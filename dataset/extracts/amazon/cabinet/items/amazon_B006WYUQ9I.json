                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these to be the supporters for my new desk. It took me about four hours to put both of them together. So let me go over the experience I had with these cabinets.Quality:It's cheap, pressed wood, covered by paint. The wood chips easily, especially when you're putting in the screws to hold the rails, if it god forbids falls down or any other mishaps. So be extra careful with this.Take as much time as you need to physically secure a screw rather than use power tools. I used power tools too, but I set it on a lower setting like 3-4. Sometimes the tool couldn't force it to go anymore and I had to tighten the screw manually.Building the drawers: The matching of the holes of metal parts and wooden parts about 40%-60% accurate. Meaning - about 40% of he holes will match up with the metal bar properly, 60% will be either too close to the metal bar, so when you screw in your screw it cracks the product, or it will be too far so kind of have it held in place by someone else while you're putting in the screw. Expect a lot of frustration with that part. It's tedious and unpleasant.The grooves on the sides of the drawers, where the bottom part supposed to slide in do not match up in about 40% of the time. Expect several drawers to have to either hit the bottom until you force it to slide ALL the way in or just not caring whether it slides all the way in and pray that the top part, the part with the cut out for the handle, will be able to fit. Either way, again, cheap production don't expect perfection, causes frustration, but much less than the screws.Building the Sides: This part is rather easy. Holes on the sides of the cabinet match to the metal railing pretty nicely, in about 99% of the time. I've had two, I think out of fourteen (I ordered two) that required a bit of nudging to get it secured with both screws, properly.Metal Rails:The rails that allow the drawers to move back and forth are of good quality, however, the rails that you put ON the drawers are not so muchly. They are also metal and for the most part, about 70% are of good quality. There are a few, however, where the wheel will stick, preventing the drawer from moving forward, leaving it about quarter of the way open. It's very, very frustrating because pressing it harder to move in does not do anything. Neither does applying a little more force. You have to press down and left on the drawer to force it to close. After a few attempts I took the drawer out and looked the wheel and it's all banged and cut from the tries of forcing the drawer all the way in. I don't know what's wrong with it, I'll try to use WD40 on it to see if it helps. Majority of the drawers do NOT have this problem.In the end, there's a little bag with four plastic corners. Do NOT forget those or your cabinets will wobble something fierce.Warning: I came upon two pieces that were not what I needed. Because of that ONE of my drawers has an issue, but it can be fixed with glue so I am not too worried. Just don't be surprised if you get a piece that is not what you need.Instructions:Instructions are fairly easy. It's just a picture of a drawer with all the parts that are labeled. I usually am really pretty inept in putting things together, but aside from a few things where I needed assistance in holding stuff down so I can fasten the screws in, the instructions were a breeze. Picture matches clearly to the part in front of you, there's very, very little confusion about what is going on and what is needed to bring the piece together. Maybe they re-done the instructions, I don't know, but I had NO trouble figuring out what needs to be done.Looks:So, when I finally put it all together I must say they look VERY nice. The coating on them is not too shiny, the color is rich and the paint does not scratch easily. Cut outs on the front of the drawers are also super comfortable when you open the drawer, I even prefer it to the handles.Final Thoughts: Despite of its shortcomings in some ways, these cabinets and drawers are a great buy on a budget. They are very sturdy, they look really good and they are cheap. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the most bang for their buck. Also if you treat them gently - aka - won't go around kicking them and scratching them - I will not be surprised if these things last you for years.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the Halifax 5-Drawer Cabinet, and it has proven to be a fantastic addition to my home organization. The assembly process was a breeze, making it a user-friendly experience right from the start.The overall quality of the Halifax cabinet is excellent. The materials used and the attention to detail in the construction reflect a high standard of craftsmanship. It feels sturdy and durable, ensuring that it will stand the test of time.One of the standout features is its suitability for small spaces. The compact design of the cabinet makes it an ideal storage solution for areas where space is limited. It fits seamlessly into my room without overwhelming the surroundings, providing both style and functionality.However, it's important to note that the drawers are not very deep. They are approximately the depth of one stack of printer paper. While this may limit the storage capacity for larger items, it works well for organizing smaller items, keeping them easily accessible and neatly arranged.In conclusion, the Halifax 5-Drawer Cabinet is a top-notch choice for those seeking an easy-to-assemble, high-quality storage solution for small spaces. While the drawers may not be very deep, their design is well-suited for organizing smaller items efficiently. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their home organization in a stylish and practical way.",
