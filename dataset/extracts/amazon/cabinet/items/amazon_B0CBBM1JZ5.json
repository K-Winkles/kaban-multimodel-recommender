                "reviewText": "It is an inexpensive cabinet yes, but the materials and hardware made it feel even cheaper. I needed a cabinet that will store some extra kitchen things. It does that. But it feels so flimsy I really couldn\u2019t store my kitchen aid mixer or anything heavy. When putting it together, I had to undo several steps a few times because the pieces wouldn\u2019t fit together well. The cabinet doors are so difficult to screw together and adjust so that the doors match and close properly. I gave up trying and now I just lift one door slightly upwards just to close the doors together. What a pain! Wish I could return it but it is really heavy for such a cheap looking item. IKEA would be high-end compared to this cabinet.",

                "reviewText": "We loved this cabinet at first site on Amazon and ordered it as a couple\u2019s holiday gift. When we finally went to build it today we ran into numerous problems. We decided we could live with the first two but the third made it impossible and we had to pack it back up and ship it back. It was horribly upsetting. 1st issue- damage to corner of a shelf (could live with that), 2nd issue- indentations would not align so back and top would be slightly off (could live with), the 3rd and decision making issues\u2026 the screws intended to secure the cabinet would not function properly. They were stripped and would not turn. We opted for the refund and now find ourselves back on the hunt for the perfect storage cabinet for our space. We have put together many pieces of furniture over the years and we\u2019ve never seen something so poorly designed despite how amazing it seems like it should be. The serious disappointment and new hesitation to buy anything we have to construct ourselves again makes me feel as though a simple refund (which by the way required us to repackage all of the pieces which was trying, tape up the box securely, and drive to the UPS Store, carrying in a heavy and large box for return), is not enough. It took away from our Christmas joy. If this company is truly confident in their products, I feel they should look over this returned item and upon finding what we did, not only refund our money but also send out a new cabinet free of charge that they feel confident will construct the way it was intended. If I\u2019d had that confidence, I wouldn\u2019t have requested a refund but rather a trade out for a new cabinet. Sadly, it was so bad, my hopes for that were depleted.",
