                "reviewText": "I was looking for a narrow and tall end table for my bedroom that I could set my jewelry box on, since I haven't been able to find a jewelry armoire that I like. I love the open space of the cabinet and the one shelf is plenty to organize some overflow from my jewelry box. I build a lot of DIY furniture and this was pretty easy, just check the picture carefully because they have a lot of parts to go in on one picture. I could not tell from the pictures but it has a metal frame on either side! Very sturdy.I wouldn't recommend this if it gets a lot of use for two issues:- the drawer just slides on plastic runners and nothing to hold it in - sometimes feels like I'm going to pull it out- the black paint/coating is pretty thin and I chipped two places moving in into my roomThese issues don't bother me because I won't be accessing the drawer or door regularly, and a Sharpie easily covers chips (I have a dedicated Sharpie for all my black furniture!). Great value - I would buy another if needed, no hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "It's really cute, small, but cute. I'm using it for a liquor cabinet and with the shelf I can't fit a handle of vodka. I ended up just taking the shelf out but I can add it back later if needed. The drawer is pretty big which is nice. I fit four shot glasses, a shaker, and some other little mixed drink tools and there's still plenty of room. The instructions were pretty self explanatory and easy to follow. There was little plastic pieces for the back I did not fully understand the purpose of but that could just be me. That was the only confusion during assembly. It's sturdy and the dark color looks awesome. Very happy with the purchase.",

Seriously, I've put together my share of prefab furniture and this one was the absolute easiest...Of course, this time, I literally did follow the instructions :-) I was pleasantly surprised, even though it's prefab (pressboard), it is quite sturdy. Love the drawer and shelf inside. Way roomier than I thought. LOVE IT!I use it to put in cables and electronics (Wii) and a few games inside. Hides the ugly cables. Super value for the money too!",

I liked the reinforcements, the tab to keep the drawer from coming all the way out.It took me (over 70 yrs. old) 1 3/4 hours to assemble and I was working slowly.I bought this cabinet as it was the perfect size to put next to my ironing board. It holds pressing tools, extra iron, pressing cloths, etc.I didn't want a cabinet that looked like it belonged in a laundry room or bathroom and this cabinet is working out perfectly. The height of the cabinet is approximately the same height as my ironing board so it gives me a place to temporarily place scissors, pins, etc. while sewing/pressing.",
