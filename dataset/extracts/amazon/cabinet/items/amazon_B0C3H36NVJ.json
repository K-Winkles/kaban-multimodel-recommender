I really liked the idea of including extra pieces of hardware - even though I had no shortages. This is a high class company.I know some sweet young thing will say her hubby assembled it 15' - it took me about 3 hours. But I am 80 years old with failing eye. Assembly can easily be accomplished by one person.Design is OK for intended use, but this will not become a family heirloom to be handed down from generation to generation. Areas of weakness are the doors pivot on pins rather than hinges and the back is made of some kind of thin composite. Overall - a great little storage cabinet.",

I purchase a LOT of low price furniture pieces (over organizer and constant redecorator) and generally they come with issues. This is a solid piece.Pros:\u2022 those cardboard back pieces\u2026yeah you\u2019re getting one\u2026but this one actually come in 2 pieces with a piece of plastic you slide each side into to become the middle support. It also comes with a notch cut out at the top to put the wall anchor through - as a mom, love this and wish all pieces came like this. That\u2019s just attention to detail if you ask me.\u2022 The shelves are very sturdy. I have heavy bottles of epoxy resin on them and I have zero concern.\u2022 It looks NICE. This is an aesthetically pleasing piece. Personally, I\u2019d prefer the doors to not have that faux paneling look, but after seeing it in person it\u2019s growing on me.\u2022 I can vacuum under it\u2026as a multi-pet home this is a MUST!\u2022 low to no tip over possibilities. The piece is sturdy and not easy to tip, but with the included wall anchor it eliminates that risk.Cons: (for me\u2026but dependent on your needs)\u2022 I can\u2019t use both of the included shelves. There\u2019s not enough height to fit all the bottles if I use both. I would need an extra couple of inches. BUT, this isn\u2019t a resin storage cabinet - it\u2019s a bathroom storage cabinet. And fitting cleaning supplies, towels, hair care products etc in this would be a breeze.I could only think of one con.Reasons for buying:1) width: I need something less than 23\u201d wide due to heating vent.2) doors no drawers: with a toddler in the house I wanted 2 doors so I could easily childproof the cabinet\u2026resin and toddlers are not a good mix (nor resin and cats from experience!)3) color: I wanted white or navy to match my bedroom and this is true white",

It looks ok.CONS: I have two issues.The first, there is a plastic piece with two channels in it, it is the middle piece that holds the back panels together. It was too wide to fit in the slot that the back panels fit into, and at full height blocked the bracket that affixes the unit to the wall. I had to trim it to fit.The second, the knob holes which are pre-drilled in the doors are at different heights. It makes the entire cabinet look wonky. Extremely disappointed.If the doors were drilled properly, I'd recommend the cabinet, for the price. With the knobs at different heights, I wouldn't recommend the cabinet at any price. Good luck, maybe yours will not have the same issues.",
