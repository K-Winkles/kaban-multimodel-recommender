Like a dark pair of soccer socks hiding in the corner will disappear until you notice the smell. :).Even having them by a window and in a room with good overhead lighting, I needed to add small LED motion detector lights at the top of each shelf so we can really see what\u2019s in there.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very basic stamped sheet metal storage cabinet",
                "reviewText": "Rating this cabinet, I am a bit torn. I really wanted to like this much better, as the size is nearly perfect for my needs. However, a number of issues almost makes me rate this a 3/5. What saves it and helps it just hang onto the four star rating for me is a couple specific features. First, the way the levelers work for the feet is a fantastic design that works excellently. Secondly, it is very easy to assemble on your own. I did it by myself in well under two hours. And finally, I like that the top and bottom halves are separately sectioned off from each other.So, when it comes to the Cons, there are a few. First, for the price point you should certainly realize that this is a value priced item and as such, it is made from relatively thin stamped steel. This means that while once assembled, it will keep nosey people out, but it's security can be easily defeated in just a couple moments by a determined thief or other untrustworthy individuals. Thus I would not recommend this if you are trying to secure expensive tools in a shop with a great number of people walking around. Second, the build quality is decent, but a little rough around the edges. Most of the panels had slight warping to them. One had a severe dent. And one had a weird bubbling/crackling effect to the surface paint that did not look good. But I could live with it as this was on the back panel and I'll never have to look at it. And finally, the top does not have any structural reinforcement like this shelves do. So the top of the cabinet is not going to be very string, so avoid heavy items on the top of the cabinet.At the $200 price point, or better, this is a value priced item, so do expect some trade offs. If you realize that, then it is a decent solution for storing certain types of items. Great for keeping little ones away from items that might be dangerous for them.",

It assembled quickly and the instructions were spot on. I put a LOT of weight in paint and chemicals in mine and it holds it with no problems.The keys work well, the shelves stay level even with heavy loads and the doors close easily. 5 out of 5!",
