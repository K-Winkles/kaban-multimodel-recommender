I paid a experienced handy man to put this cabinet together & he had a hard time withe the doors. After several weeks & using a powe drill myself i finally got the doors to line up & actually stick to the magnets. I can say after watch the video provided by the sellers in 1 of the pictures of this item help me get the doors leveled & open & close correctly.",

We ended up getting three of these cabinets and putting them together to make one \u201csolid\u201d piece. We absolutely love them. They each took about an hour to build (40 minutes on the fastest one) but I think that\u2019s largely because of how well they are put together. The doors are on a push magnet lock, that seem very heavy duty and hold the doors shut well when closed. Cannot believe the quality we got for the price when we were looking at buffets that were so much more expensive. Would absolutely recommend these to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "this cabinet was the perfect size and look for what we wanted- and I can\u2019t get over how much I like it\u2026now that\u2019s it\u2019s finished. it was super easy to put together - I did it by myself. however, it was a pain in the tush to get the doors aligned and they\u2019re not perfect, hence only 4 stars.tip- don\u2019t put all four screws in the door hinge on the inside of cabinet. just use the two in the holes that allow for movement up and down to help with the door alignment.I used a hand-held screwdriver and wouldn\u2019t recommend a power driver because it might be really easy to strip out screw holes.overall it\u2019s a nice cabinet for the price. it\u2019s primarily a wall filler and lamp holder- so we\u2019ll see how it holds up.",

Also, the quality isn't the best. My cabinet doors are misaligned because of where the holes were placed and the back board is off due to the holes. The size and space is perfect just what I was looking for. Overall would I recommend no.",
