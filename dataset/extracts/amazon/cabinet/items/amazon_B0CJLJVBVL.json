This floor storage cabinet hutch cupboard is not only designed for kitchen use but also suitable for living rooms and home offices (I have it in my office). Its rustic grey color adds a charming touch well as much needed storage space.The assembly process was smooth, thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions provided. It took me about an hour to put everything together by myself. What I loved most during the assembly process was that all the pieces were clearly labeled, making it incredibly easy to follow the guide.One of the key features that attracted me to this storage cabinet was its farmhouse-inspired design (I love that rustic old world kinda look). The rustic grey finish is absolutely beautiful, adding a touch of elegance to my living room setup without being too flashy or overstated. The metal handles on the drawers are both functional and stylish, seamlessly blending with the overall design.In terms of storage capacity, this has a lot more than it appears. It comes equipped with multiple drawers and shelves that provide ample storage options for my kitchen utensils, cookbooks, dinnerware, and other knick-knacks. I particularly appreciate the adjustable shelf inside the cabinet doors as it allows me to customize the space according to my storage needs.The spacious tabletop makes it a fantastic impromptu workstation where I can set up my laptop and office supplies whenever required.Best features - pretty and functional",

                "reviewText": "This is a good item. It's study and looks good. Assembly is not really hard. The pre-drilled holes all line up well. There are enough screws. The sticky tags with part letters are strong enough to stay on, but can be taken off easily. But...It is very easy to get a piece on the wrong way. The instructions are of little help in showing you which is the right way to orient a piece. Worse, pieces will go in wrong--easily. You only find out your mistake steps later. I did a lot of unscrewing.You will read this and say, \"this guy is an idiot, that won't happen to me.\" I hope it won't. But I tried real hard to do this right. I failed.SInce this is a nice item, you may want to buy it anyway. If you do, be careful of part H, the bottom shelf and part I, the back. My part H will be forever upside down. It's too hard to fix now. But it doesn't look bad and this does look nice.",

                "reviewText": "Looks decent when put together and feels relatively sturdy. One big issue: the pre-drilled holes on a few of the panels were wonky. They didn\u2019t line up properly and had to be re-drilled in several areas. The areas affected were luckily not too obvious unless you\u2019re looking for it, but you have to be a little handy to put it together. Maybe it was just a flaw on the one I purchased but I didn\u2019t notice until I had started building so I decided to just go with it and drill new cams instead of returning. Overall it was priced ok for what it is, just wish I didn\u2019t have to put in the extra work. Also, the screws are not great quality so be careful not to strip them.",
