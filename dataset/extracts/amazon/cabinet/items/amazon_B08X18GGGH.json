                "reviewText": "Pros:-I purchased the 30 in.W X 18 in.D X 72 in, MODEL UHD20162B-Very nice cabinet for the garage.-Easy to assemble but it takes hours to assemble. It took me 2.5 hours with a power drill and I am handy and have done this kind of assembly before.-Parts are labeled and screws come in numbered bags which is great.-It is well packed. I expected at least one dented part but all were satisfactory, no dents.-The tools provided are great. The screw driver provided is magnetic which I used to start the screw as to not strip the screw tread with the power drill. The wrench for adjusting the legs also worked satisfactorily. -The cabinet is sturdy and all the parts fit together well. I expected the doors to not line up but the doors aligned well. I thought I would need to drill holes for some unaligned part. No drilling required.-The shelves could be heavier duty but you can always cut a piece of \u00be\u201d plywood to put on top of the shelf as the design of corner shelf holders should be able to hold a lot more weight.-Straps are provided to secure to the wall.Cons:-It should have one more shelf.-The \u201cEngineered Nylon Anchors for quick assembly\u201d are just garbage. The manufacturer should have provided all screws. Screws are faster and hold stronger than nylon anchors.",

The doors in particular not solid and because of how they ship the doors come in two pieces which make them less than secure. Love the look and the amount of storage though!",

Great product and the price is great as well.",

Impressed by the packaging, the easy to assemble instructions( all the pieces are labled clearly so that you really can not go wrong assembling). I am so impressed by the quality and sturdiness of this product without breaking the bank! I ordered 5 cabinets and will order more as I continue to organize my garage. The wheels are heavy duty and roll quite easily. It does reccomend building with 2 people, but as a 57 year old lady I built by myself without a problem. It can be done. I would say I spent 2 hours building the first one and it gets quicker as you build more.",
