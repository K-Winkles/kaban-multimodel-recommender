                "reviewText": "I bought this as extra bathroom storage, so it\u2019s a decent piece for that purpose. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want this piece in my living room, dining room, etc. because it definitely looks like mdf board. It\u2019s not IKEA quality. I am a pretty handy person and have assembled a lot of furniture. I had a cordless drill and multiple screwdrivers ready. This tiny cabinet took forever to assemble, and I was moving quickly. So, if you are assembling it alone, be prepared for a solid two hours. The pieces holding the back in place were a huge pain, but otherwise, everything went together as intended with no missing pieces or split boards. Overall, I\u2019m happy because it looks nice for what it is. But, considering how long it takes to assemble, I don\u2019t think the price is a \u201cdeal.\u201d",

Everything assembled as intended and the unit is square and straight. It came well packaged. It looks very cute and fits exactly as I need it to. Would buy again (if I needed another one.)",

                "reviewText": "Assembly instructions were in a different language but the pictures were easy to follow. A few of the screws were too long (yes I used the correct screws according to the instructions) and it screwed through the surfaces. One surface was the inside where the door magnet is secured and the other was the very top surface where the screw secure the front molding. So I currently have 2 screw punctures at the top surface. I have the piece in my master bathroom and it release a somewhat toxic strange smell through my bathroom and bedroom causing my household members a headache when they entered my room. I left in the garage for now hoping it will air out.",
