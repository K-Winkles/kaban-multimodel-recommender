                "reviewText": "I put this together with the tools provided (Allen wrench + a reversible screw driver provided that has both flat head and Phillips (you only need Phillips)). I don't recall total time, maybe an hour? Instructions are clear (and mind the holes shown in pictures - it has you put it together exactly how it should go and then you flip it - you'll understand when assembling). One of the most sturdy and weighted items I've put together in awhile (since everything these days is fabric - this is NOT). I have 25 folders in the bottom port that fit comfortably (if you have many more than that - I'd buy two). Love that it has two smaller drawers, which I use for important papers I still need to review or things I need to access more quickly. I will likely buy another one for additional storage, but honestly the one does just fine. I'm just a fan of how it's constructed to be honest and might use another one for other storage or even a cute side table (simply because it's solid unlike other stuff). I anticipate it will last - the only thin you have to be careful of is the open ended turn \"screws\" that lock the actual screws into place - if you don't get them in the hole fully before you turn, it can chip the finish - but it's not difficult. Hope this is helpful! I would recommend!",
