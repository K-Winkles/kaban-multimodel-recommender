I laid out all of the pieces prior to putting it together to make sure I had everything I needed before proceeding.",

                "reviewText": "For those who want to use this to store cookware and then complain that it\u2019s too small...don\u2019t. Read the dimensions for goodness sake! We bought this for a 1/2 bath to store extra TP, hand towels, soap, etc., works well for that purpose. But you do get what you pay for.The reason I give it 3-stars is because the tolerances of dowels and some other hardware to their respective holes do not align, at all. Either our dowels were far too narrow or the holes far too wide. Further, as the dowels are used to hold the bottom, front base trim in place to the sides and bottom of the cabinet, that piece would leave about a 1/2 gap between bottom of cabinet and top of trim. I used wood glue to fill the holes and then clamped it in place in effort to correct but after a few seconds the dowels popped up through the cabinet and the laminate finished broke away in about the circumference of a silver dollar. So it seems the holes were not just too wide but also too shallow (not deep enough). I then used a small piece of white paper and small piece of white duct tape to cover it up.No sense in returning it, even though I should. I\u2019ll use it knowing that it\u2019s not a quality piece of furniture meant to impress guests, it\u2019s functional and temporary in the greater scheme of things.",
