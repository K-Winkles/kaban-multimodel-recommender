                "reviewText": "This coffee/bar cart is very cute. I don't have space for one so I'm using it as a printer stand in my office and it works wonderfully. It was a bit difficult to put together since not all of the screws are labeled, but doable, took me about 30 minutes. I love that it comes with two different sets of feet, one set was casters with brakes on two of them, and the other set are adjustable height stationary feet.",
