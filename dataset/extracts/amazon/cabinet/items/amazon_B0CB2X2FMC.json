Fits most household water bottles or tumblers, like glass or plastic water bottles, sport bottles, insulated travel mugs or tumblers, baby bottles, kids sippy cups and many more. Ridges on both sides prevent bottles from rolling and give each bottle a room.",
            "\u2605High Quality ABS Material and Solid Construction - Each shelf is made of thick ABS plastic with dense reinforcement at the bottom. Each tier is tightly connected by 4 sturdy stainless steel solid posts. The 2 tier water bottle holder can hold up to 50 lbs without wobble or crack.",

I'm happy with the purchase, it fits every size water bottle we have. It was easy to assemble, and the metal posts were heavy and super strong, the plastic is lightweight but durable and strong.Unfortunately, I measured wrong, and it didn't fit with all three shelves, but it's completely fine with just two. I used the \"extra\" one to hold cups one at a time, on a towel, to apply vinyl decals to cups/bottles for a sports team.Overall, very worthwhile purchase!",
