I wanted something with a little bit of counter space on the top for a few makeup items and my contact solutions. This fit perfectly. It is not the highest quality but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be. The material it is made from is very unique and has actually proven to be very easy to clean in the bathroom with lots of moisture. The directions for assembling were not as confusing as previous posts have suggested just lay out all the pieces in front of you and take it step by step. Only took me about 8 minutes. Also instead of using the top part for toilet paper I utilize it for a small square box of tissues turned on its side and it is perfect. Have actually come to really love this piece.",

                "reviewText": "This item would not be worth it over a 15 buck price tag. The materials are ok, it\u2019s mostly a foam type material and the cabinet is very small. But, if you have a tiny space, and need space for meds, random little items, this shelf is great. Perfect for a small rental. Not sure why reviews were saying it was hard to put together? This shelf could be assembled by a toddler. It\u2019s essentially puzzle pieces with some screws to fasten it together. I will update my review to see how it holds up to humidity, but I might take it apart and clear coat it so it holds up to water better. Little concerned that it would warp in a humid environment. Other wise, I was able to store all meds of ours and I ordered a second one to sit next to our sink. Our bathroom has little to no storage, and I used to have a bin on the floor to keep our meds in, this is much much better and it was friendly to the wallet.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with this cabinet. It's definitely VERY small but it's perfect for what I needed to fit in it. I have no storage besides underneath my sink which has been a pain, but now, feminine hygiene products and baby wipes are conveniently right next to the toilet and I can hide my cat's litter box scoop in the bottom cabinet. It goes together like a puzzle during assembly so it's easy to put together. The finished product is sturdy enough. I wouldn't recommend this for storing anything remotely heavy since it's super lightweight (which is nice imo because it moves easily when I need to clean the bathroom).I will say it looks kinda cheap because the matte finish on the material is kinda odd and they give you shiny silver screws. The color is more dark grey than black. After assembling it, I took some spray paint I had laying around and painted it in under 5 minutes, then added some different knobs I already had. Now it looks 5x more expensive and I love it.If you want something super solid to hold a lot/heavy stuff, I don't recommend this.",

It\u2019s more of a styrofoam and wood shaving compressed product. Box it arrived in was only 4\u201d thick and 12\u201d tall. The bottom shelf holds a comet container and 2 lysol toilet gel bottles, it\u2019s very tight fit. The middle shelf fits 1 roll of Costco size toilet paper, if you squeeze it in. The toilet paper section does fit a roll but would work better with a roller in it so the rolls does stick when pulling tissue out.It is cute, but honestly wasn\u2019t worth the price.",
