                "reviewText": "I needed a cabinet for my porch so bad. I saw the tan one on sale but didnt order it fast enough so I bought this one . It was more expensive but I think it actually looks better . It was pkgd well . I assembled it in 1 hour . The directions are plain and show close ups on certain parts. The parts fit together with no problem . You just need to use a little strength on putting the side panels on. all the holes matched up pretty good for the rails . If I noticed one was a little off I went ahead and tighten screws anyway . YOU NEED AN ELECTRIC screw driver or something electric or you'll be there all day. I didnt use a mallet or a level . I put extra plant stuff in it and tackle boxes . The distance between the shelves werent far apart enough to put my big dish soap and odoban gal jug straight up so I just turned them slightly side ways . I could have probably arranged the shelves to be better but it would give up to much needed space for me . I will def buy another one in the future. and its made in USA thats a big plus for me",

It is well made and very sturdy.!It is a perfect cabinet out outside to store gardening tools etc.I did have a problem initially, when I discovered that the shelves were slightly too short. They would collapse when I closed the cabinet. I contacted the manufacturer who was very helpful. They sent replacement shelves that worked perfectly.I love the cabinet it is exactly what I needed for outdoor storage.",

                "reviewText": "9/20/22 Even though I measured the area I planned to use this cabinet, it is bigger than I thought it would be. Delivery box is too heavy for me to return, had to ask someone for help to move it.After reading other reviews, I learned there are no side handles to assist in moving the cabinet after assembling it, so I added handles on side during assembly. I bought them separately at Lowes. Not quite as heavy after assembly and easier to move with handles. If you add handles be sure to avoid area where the shelves lay inside or the shelves won't fit. Luckily I thought of this in advance.Cabinet is sturdy and fairly easy to assemble. I did it alone in about an hour.but had to have help getting doors on because I have very little strength in my hands. Male friend got them on fairly easily. Instructions are poor but I was able to understand them, just take your time and be patient.Was packaged very well and all parts were included. Delivery package is very thick cardboard and is very heavy to move with parts inside. Cabinet itself after assembly is not as heavy. All walls of cabinet are very thick plastic, very sturdy.Seems like it will be water resistant on outside but probably not inside the cabinet. i will be using on a screened porch so may not be a problem. Would be perfect for a garage or storage building. Color is not a deep glossy black but a muted matte black, but not gray.I would not order this cabinet again simply because it is bigger than I wanted. Won't return it because I already have it assembled and is too heavy for me to manage to return it.",
