It looks great, good quality, and enough room in each drawer for office supplies. I have to laugh at one ridiculous photo I saw with drill holes all over the boards. Everything is predrilled. No drill needed! Pay not attention to that photo. The 7 drawer WILL hold scrap book paper with room to spare. Inside drawer approx. 13\" x 15 1/4\" give or take. I believe the 9 drawer has smaller drawers and does not fit the scrap book paper.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars While assembly isn't trivial, it comes together for a nice, functional, piece.",
                "reviewText": "I actually enjoyed assembling this piece. The parts fit well together, all drilled holes align well, and cuts seem pretty square. Once fully assembled, the drawers are centered and glide easily, gaps are small and even, and unit is very sturdy. My only complaint is that two of the drawer faces had noticeable nicks on their edges. I was able to touch them up, but I would have liked all unblemished drawer faces. I also wish the manufacture would substitute something more environmentally friendly than styrofoam for packing.This piece has the most parts of any piece of DIY furniture I've assembled (258+ and I didn't use the 20 for the castor wheels), but, once completed, it is nice looking piece that perfectly suited my needs. It took me about 3 hours to complete, but I take some steps other may not take. First, I lay everything out in assembly-line fashion, making sure I have all the parts. Second (and I recommend this step to everyone), I used wood glue on all the wooden dowel pins. The cam lock connectors used in this piece (and in most DIY furniture) are pretty cheap, especially when used with particle board. They either bottom out too easily or they won't stay tight over time. Either way, their use generally results in loose and unstable joints. However, they do make decent 'clamps' for holding the panels in place while the wood glue dries. Wood glue is far superior to the cams and extends the usefulness of the furniture by years (I have Sauder bookcases I built 24 years ago that are still solid - even after multiple moves). I recommend Titebond II wood glue, but even Elmers would be better than just the cams alone. Finally, I don't skip steps.The instructions are fairly clear, and anyone who's ever done DIY furniture before shouldn't have any issues. Several points, though. You might be tempted, as I was, to secure the drawer bottoms with small nails (not included). Initially, it seems as though they will not be secured and will sag. But, once the drawer slide rails are added to the drawers, the bottoms are secured. Second, you might be tempted to skip attaching the plastic inserts against the back panels in the final step. Don't. It's not intuitive that these 8 small plastic pieces would do much of anything, but they actually add detectable stability to the unit. Finally, and I can't stress this enough: do not over-tighten cam pins or screws. Particle board is a poor material, but it will work for light furniture until you strip it over-tightening a screw. Wood glue can be used to repair the hole (put glue in stripped hole, insert screw, let dry completely), but the repair will be weaker than an unstripped hole, which isn't that great to start with.To summarize, not a bad piece of DIY furniture. With a little care and patience, following the instructions, the chest should provide years of function and decent aesthetics for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "This set of drawers is fantastic. I got it to replace the janky plastic drawers I had forever. This provides more storage place and is sturdy for my printer. I measured before buying and it is a perfect fit for the little nook I needed it for. It\u2019s sturdy, the drawers slide smoothly and pull out almost the whole way so you can truly take advantage of all the storage it offers. This is definitely an office supply or makeup product type storage, the drawers aren\u2019t very deep but perfect for the above things. It took about 3 hours to put together and it was a bit of a pain but that\u2019s because it was stop-and-go since I was working while putting it together. The directions are clear and correct, follow them! For the drawers I bought the Criusia 25 pack drawer organizer (also here on Amazon) and they\u2019ve filled up almost 4 drawers mixing and matching the pieces. Love it overall!",

Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s simples \u00e0 monter, si tous les meubles pouvaient \u00eatre aussi simples, ce serait bien! Toutes les pi\u00e8ces sont num\u00e9rot\u00e9es. Les trous sont bien faits, aux bons endroits.Ils sont tr\u00e8s bien pens\u00e9s. Les fonds de tiroirs et fond du meuble tr\u00e8s bien maintenus.Les tiroirs coulissent parfaitement, se placent bien parall\u00e8les dans le meuble.J'ai pass\u00e9 cette commande le 31 Mai, livraison pr\u00e9vue entre le 1er juillet et le 4, je l'ai re\u00e7ue le 5 juin!Je n'ai qu'un point n\u00e9gatif \u00e0 soulever, une des planches d'un tiroir \u00e9tait ab\u00eem\u00e9e, voir la photo. Mais cela n'a pas g\u00ean\u00e9 au montage du meuble et n'a pas fragilis\u00e9 la tenue du fond du tiroir et \u00e7a ne se voit absolument pas. J'avais enlev\u00e9 une \u00e9toile au d\u00e9but pour ce d\u00e9faut mais \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion, le meuble n'en est pas affect\u00e9, donc je lui laisse 5*.Oh et un autre mini point n\u00e9gatif, il y a un autocollant sur le dessus du meuble et quand on l'enl\u00e8ve il laisse des traces de colle mais avec de l'ac\u00e9tone v\u00e9g\u00e9tale, \u00e7a part sans ab\u00eemer la couleur du meuble.Je recommande vraiment l'achat de ses tours de tiroirs. Je partais avec un l\u00e9ger \u00e0 priori car meubles en \"compress\u00e9\" mais franchement ils sont top. La simplicit\u00e9 du design fait qu'ils passent partout sans d\u00e9noter.",

Arrived well packaged but there was slight damage to the base, but as this was going into a cupboard it didn\u2019t matter. Was worried when I saw the hardboard bases to the draws but they are held firmly in place with the the draw rails. Assembly instructions were easy to follow. All in all quite happy with it.",
