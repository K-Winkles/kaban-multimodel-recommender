                "reviewText": "After going to IKEA and finding almost everything I wanted on back order, I thought I would see how available items were on Amazon. I am glad I did because this storage cabinet is excellent. Here are a few specific notes:- Yes, it is particle board, but I wasn't expecting anything else at this price and you shouldn't either! That said, it is very well engineered. Solid and well designed structurally. Looks great too.- The instruction manual is the best I have seen for a DIY product. Very clear, well written, very well illustrated and even amusing (\"Pro Tip: Lift with your legs. And, you know, your arms\"). - The engineering is with very low tolerances, which is generally excellent, but be aware of it when putting in the shelves - they don't have gaps at the side. True too for the door hinges - more on that below. - The door hinges are excellent, but the holes for their placement are pretty tight for a vertical install. It will take some pressure to get the screw to take. The manual recommends you install these once the main cabinet is standing, but I found it easier to install the doors while the cabinet is on it's side. Position the cabinet so you can install the opened door while on the floor and you have more control on the hinge install. Keep in mind this will mean a very careful movement (close the door before changing sides) to each side of the cabinet to bring it to the floor, but it made that step a lot easier. I would rather lift and place the cabinet on the floor a couple of times than try to hold up a door and push with a screwdriver. - The sizing of the cabinet is also just right. It fits a medium sized storage container just right, and there are enough shelves to make it highly functional for many purposes. But it is still not too wide, deep or tall to get through a doorway if you need to. - I was a little surprised that there was nothing besides the top and bottom to hold the sides in place, but once those shelves are in it holds it's form even with movement. - Another pleasant surprise was the cabinet \"feet\". 4 PVC foot blocks help secure the cabinet structurally and make it easier to slide across a surface if needed. They also keep it from direct contact with the floor which is good.Overall, an excellent product and I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start off by saying that this is my 2nd & 3rd purchase of this cabinet. Living in a home built in the 1800's, we lack storage! The first one was purchased two years ago and used as a linen closet for my bathroom. After renovating our pantry this past week, I purchased two more of these to put side by side. This gives me lots of storage! I can tell you the instructions improved immensely on these since my first purchase. Very clear and easy to follow this time around. Even the nails/screws/pieces were clearly labeled.Here are my pro's and cons:Pro's-Instructions were very clear and the unit was surprisingly easy to put together (except for the doors - you'll need a 2nd set of hands to align the hinges). But being a tiny woman, I managed to put these together in no-time.-The hinges on the door do allow you to adjust the doors both horizontally and vertically in case they don't look even. The first cabinet had a big gap between the doors when I first installed them. The second cabinet, the right door fell a little lower than the left. Adjusting fixed it a bit.-You can easily adjust the feet in case your floor is slightly uneven to adjust the unit. I put two next to each other and this feature came in very handy.-Shelves are deep and adjustable.-Looks modern and cleanCons:-The door handles on one of the units are not even. Meaning, the holes were drilled slightly off. Nothing I can do about that one. Hardly noticeable, but I see it....-As great as this unit is, the back of it is severely lacking in quality. It's literally a piece of cardboard backing (not even particle board). How is this possible??-The doors close SUPER loudly. Maybe i'm just used to my soft close kitchen cabinets. I purchased cabinet bumpers to help with this. It made a difference.-While the shelves themselves are sturdy, they are made of particle board. I made the mistake in my bathroom cabinet of storing some liquid soap bottles in there and my iron. BIG mistake. I had a leak and the shelf bubbled and warped. Just a heads up to use contact paper or liners if you plan to store anything with a liquid.Overall, I am very happy with how these came out. They serve the purpose, look great, and didn't cause me to lose my mind when installing. These are worth the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble except for the doors which are tricky and I needed some help. Pretty sturdy once it was together. Fragile finish - many places where the Dakota Oak finish chipped off. 2 boards had cracks down the middle of the finish. The particle board split while sliding on one of the plastic base legs due to fragility. I gave this a 4 star because it's the right size and it looks nice after fully assembled. Fits my limited ares perfectly. Sauder Customer service in the US w\u00e0s easy to reach for damaged parts and only a few days to receive. Not a bad deal for the price. You won't get highest quality furniture at this price so don't expect a $900 storage closet but it's nice for what I spent.",

                "reviewText": "Here are a few things -- We assembled the unit on a carpet. We had it laid down and followed the instructions on paper as well as the you tube video link provided on the instruction manual.- When we were assembling the U shaped base, we realized that if we aligned 3 of the screw holes, the 4th would not. So we used a power tool to create a slightly shifted hole. We did not need to use a drillbit . Just used the screw itself to do that.- Putting in the doors using the hinges - that was the trickier part - the doors are a bit mis-aligned from the top but only slightly mis-aligned at the bottom but luckily its not too visible from a distance.- There is a gap between the doors from where you can see about 1/2 inch of the shelving. I think we need to adjust the hinges to close that gap. It is not looking bad though.- The unit is located in our dining room and fits in nicely. It was a bit wobby until we added the shelves and dumped some heavy items on the bottom shelf.- After the storage items are loaded ( I am using it as a pantry ) it is steady and has weight and our cats are having a great time using the top of the unit as a hideaway. The dining table is working as a launch pad. lol- Note that the holes they made on the cardboard for the back from where to slip out the metal strip to attach to the wall was not in the middle so the strip comes out twisted. It would not be easy to get that comfortably attached to the wall.",

                "reviewText": "The cabinet overall is a great product and easy to assemble. The finish is good and easy to clean. The variable choices for shelf designation is great, offering lots of choices. There are a couple of things that could be improved. 1) the backing of the cabinet is made of thin cardboard that is tacked on and does not provide any structural strength and if items are placed hard against could break. 2) The doors have spring loaded hinges that keep them closed but in my opinion are a bit week and should of had a magnetic catch at the top of each door.",
