The instructions were good and it was easy to assemble. The parts include a Phillips screwdriver however I decided to use my drill especially for assembling the back panel. The instructions stated \"team assembly recommended\" but I put it together by myself with no problems. It matches my floors perfectly.",

Negative - There was tape on the back of the and when I started to pull it off it peeled the backing. I just left the tape, not a big deal as no one sees the back anyway. Besides that the price was good, it's not real wood, however, if it were it would of costs much more. I did order another one as the storage area is quite large and held my sewing items very well. Out of sight out of mind.",

It was perfectly labeled, the pictured instructions were flawless, they supplied extra hardware in case something didn't work quite right, and it looks and functions perfectly. So many times the instructions are too vague, there are missing parts, etc., but not with this company. I would definitely purchase another product from them without hesitation!",
