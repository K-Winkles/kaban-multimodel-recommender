The color is a bit more on the yellow side in person, to my eyes\u2026.but it goes nicely with my other neutrals. Just threw a few things on top to see it\u2019s potential\u2026we are using it as a wine bar/liquor cabinet. I love how narrow it is, and bonus for me, the lifted legs allow for it to lay flush against the wall. It was easy to assemble. The drawer is ok- it does not have actual roller tracks but the little dowel pieces stop it from coming all the way out. Overall, I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT - I made two small changes to these cabinets that I think make them look a little more high end. The cane detail was pulling very yellow in my space. So I picked up a can of minwax special walnut stain and gave all the caning a coat. This really helped. Then I changed out the wood handles for matte black. I'm so happy with his this turned out.I wasn't expecting to much for $149 a piece, but I am so pleased with these cabinets! They look great pushed together and they make a really nice sideboard. They're not too deep, which works well for my narrow dining room.Assembly wasn't awful. The first one took me about 2 hours, but I was by myself. The second one only took an hour and went much faster once I knew what I was doing.Ultimately, I'm very happy with the purchase and the price point. Some others are much more expensive and don't have a drawer, just the cabinets. This is really nice.",

As you can see in the pictures the doors don't align and the drawer does not have a slider. But I am not upset about it, to me it's a very minor thing and not very noticeable. It still is very usable. If you can see past that then this is for you! Assembly was easy. Based on previous reviews that they were missing parts, what I did was before I assembled I checked the listed parts first. I changed the handles to make it even prettier!I would recommend this product. Delivery was quick too, and I'm in Canada!",
