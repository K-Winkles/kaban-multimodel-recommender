I saw a lot of comments on needing two people or that it took a really long time so I was hesitant however I did it all by myself and it was super easy if you follow step by step. It\u2019s spacious on the inside and can hold a lot. It also doesn\u2019t feel cheap and wobbly all the pieces and shelves are very solid. I highly recommend if you need more storage in your bathroom and can\u2019t mount a cabinet to get this product.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because of its size, and amount of storage! It did not disappoint. It took me about an hr to assemble. I haven't ever built anything before. But I made this happen...I measured my space, several times to make sure. Bought ur, abs walla. Perfect fit. Good abd tall as well! Love the color. And had a perfect price!! It hood alot, and seems pretty sturdy. My son and I carried the box to the car. But he carried it into the house alone. He's 13. So not to heavy. Love it! Highly recommend ..",

                "reviewText": "i am so disappointed in this piece, i dont know if i just got really unlucky or what but this thing is awful. ive put together tons of this style of mdf furniture, and usually its pretty decent for the price and i don't have issues putting it together. for over the toilet organizers, this is more expensive than other ones i own, so i was hoping it would be better quality, but its genuinely worse than the $60 metal one i got from a big box store.firstly, the larger of the two back board is not solid. it is two rectangles held together with TAPE. literally thats all thats holding them together across the entire span of the middle, a big piece of tape that youre meant to leave there. as you can guess, that makes the whole thing wobbly and provides little to no support, and also makes it a real PITA when installing it into the grooves, because it wants to fold and flop out. it also appears to be sized too small, since once fully constructed the whole piece came unseated from the groove almost immediately and now just flops around in there. so thats fun.the doors are another major pain- adjusting them so they are sitting level and look even is an exercise in frustration, and there is no way to make it so there isnt a pretty large gap between them that shows into the cabinet. the screws meant to loosen so you can move them left or right are very imprecise and if i move them any further, they fall out, so theyre at their limit. theres also the annoying fact that the only thing keeping the doors from bowing into the cabinet is that shelf inside acting as a door stop. the loud CLONK they make hitting the shelf is annoying enough, as is the force of them knocking things over inside of it, but it also means that if you didnt want the shelf in there, youre SOL.the worst part though is that the whole thing is so, SO wobbly and rickety. even double checking every single screw, the thing wobbles freely left to right in and out of square so badly that just trying to open the doors makes it shift. in an attempt to make it less wobbly i bought some plastic corner brackets and installed a bunch, and that seems to have worked for the time being, but cmon. i mean you cant even level the doors like the instructions say until youve used corner brackets, because moving the door at all is enough to shift all the pieces.i wish i could return this awful piece of furniture, but we had already recycled the boxes and now drilled more holes trying to make it workable. so annoyed that i paid a hundred and thirty dollars for such a garbage quality product, absolutely avoid this or at least keep the boxes and everything until you see it fully together.",
