Before this unit, I had to put extra tp, kleenex, and my wax scents on top of the toilet back or on the floor. This is so lightweight (you could say cheap) and easy to assemble and fits absolutely perfectly in this tiny slot between the wall and the toilet. Everything I need fits on and in it! I have two oversized to rolls in it. You do have to slightly squish them to get them in, but I'm quite happy with how they work. Even though the material isn't real wood, it is sturdy and held firmly together with interlocking joints and 10 screws.I'd been searching for a year for something that would work in this space and this little unit is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the more unique pieces of flat pack furniture I\u2019ve built. Although it has screws to finalize when assembled, they are not needed as this piece fits together like a 3d puzzle that is actually kind of fun to assemble. The material is super light weight but still sturdy and I think it will handle moisture very well. Taking off one star as the edges are a little rough but not too bad. Overall, a good value and a good little piece. Kudos to whoever came up with the unique design assembly. I would buy more from this brand.",

I don't use it as a roller just storage. It's the only cabinet I was able to get that fit a very small area. It's surprisingly sturdy given it's size. Great value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "With that being said, this cabinet is such a space saving addition 2 my bathroom. There's always that space between the toilet & the vanity & its a perfect fit. It's functional....2 a point. Remember I said u get what u pay 4 & it is functional but it's construction isn't what I expected. This whole thing only comes with 6 screws. As u can see in the pics it's held 2gether with slots & tabs. The door hinges is a pointed tab inserted in a hole. I have yet 2 establish what funky polymer this thing is made of. So, I can't speak 2 its sturdiness. But I think it will hold up 4 my needs holding tissue rolls, kleenex & a candle. Good value 4 the money, looks good, functional. A win-win here IMHO. I'll update later if the need arises.I also bought the wicker front cabinet 4 my other bathroom so I will copy & paste this review when asked 2 review it. So, yes, I would purchase it again & Yes, I would recommend it 2 others.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to snap together. The bottom shelf doesn't hold large toilet paper rolls very well as it's too skinny but if you squeeze the roll slightly you can shove it in there. I can fit 2 comfortably standing up and one on its side. You have to do the same for the square tissue - once it's in there it's good and when you pull for a tissue it doesn't pull the rack down or wiggle. I'm happy with the purchase for what I needed it to do.",
