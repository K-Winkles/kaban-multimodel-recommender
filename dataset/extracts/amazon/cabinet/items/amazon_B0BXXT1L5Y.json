                "reviewText": "Whew. That was brutal. If you have a power drill, you definitely want to use it for this one. Without one, it took me over 2 hours to construct.Oh but it was well worth it. Quite pleased with the final outcome. Sturdy, roomy, functional tidy. The aethetic provides a gorgeous, sleek minimalist taken on mid century modern.VERY nice materials. Excellent design. Well engineered. Solid. Very solid. Excellent instructions. Clear, easy to see, thorough.The sliding drawers are tight and move smoothly. No wobbling or clacking. No slouching tracks etc. The raw wood drawer walls are lightweight and solid. The bottoms of the drawers are decent quality compressed board. Not that flimsy glorified cardboard. Attaching the installed tracks to the finished drawers is an end step. It was tricky at first. But my solution was to lightly mark the hole drilled in the wood above the track ditch. Then I used a screwdriver to pull the metal track forward and align it with the mark. Pushing the screw into place from the inside per instructions, while gently wiggle pushing the metal track with my thumb into fine tuned alignment would provide a \"click\" sound as the screw and track hole aligned. After messing with a few techniques to get the alignment technique figured on the first drawer, and finding this method, the remaining drawer to track construction was very fast and efficient. That was the only \"frustrating\" part of the build. Finding the process that worked for me to align two small holes, on a side wall, with a well engineered, snug track ditch offering snug resistance to the metal track inlay. But! The way the drawers and tracks are designed like this - makes for an exceptionally smooth and secure push and pull action! It was worth the mini patience hissy fit at first.Same excellent quality with the hinged door. It does not wobble or smack shut. The hinges are quality and have good resistance, providing a very nice \"controlled\" open and close.The wheels are in the better end of the \"okay-good\" spectrum. The metal mounting plates are excellent quality. The wheels function well. The plastic material is sturdy. The locks hold well.I did use an appropriate glue product in the predrilled holes and along flat sides of contact pieces as added measure. After finishing the build I thought the stability and structure would have been fine without the added measure.I think I want to get the matching 7 drawer piece. I expected it would would be a reasonable solution to my needs. I did not expect to be so pleased with everything. Aesthetic, space, solid, functionality.",

I have a large amount of manicure & nail art supplies that I had stored in a Stanley FatMax tool box but wanted something nicer to keep next to my work table & easier to find what I needed. This has plenty of room for everything, was easy to assemble. The shipping packaging was the best I\u2019ve seen. Nothing was damaged when opened the box. I do wish the drawers opened a little further to be able to see what is in the back of the deep drawers. My only other complaint is it came with corner bumper guards(which I appreciate) but the double stick mounting tape was not strong enough to hold them in place. But I am loving this cabinet.",

You will have to take out a measuring tape, square, a pilot punch, and a pencil and figure out where the holes should be.If you have no experience working on these types of corrections , save your time and energy and buy something else. You will not get this to work.If you have woodworking skills, you are also better off buying from a different manufacturer.If you enjoy wasting time fixing a poor product from a company with no quality control, then by all means order this mistake and get your tools ready.There is no excuse for craftsmanship this poor.",
