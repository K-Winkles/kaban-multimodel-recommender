                "reviewText": "We're using this buffet under our wall mounted TV and it looks great, highly recommend.The grey model looks exactly as pictured, very happy with the overall design. The materials certainly aren't extremely high quality, but certainly better than you'd find at most big box stores. According to the product description the top is wood and the other parts are HDF (much better than MDF - medium density fiber board).The only thing I didn't lock are the used of cam connectors for the bigger pieces, they don't give me the feeling of reliability. Also, the dowels are very loose, they more-so function for indexes the parts to match up correctly than to actually enhance the structural integrity. All that being said, if you're handy you could easily make this into a solid piece of furniture by getting bigger dowels and gluing them and I'm sure small high quality screws in the right places would really help.To be clear, it's solid as of the day it was built, but with 2 wild kids, I'm sure they'll find some way to break it eventually.It takes about 3 hours to assemble if you're hand screwing, but if you're careful with an impact driver you might be ok. DO NOT use the impact driver on the cabinet door knobs, the threaded on the knob side is good but not great.",

Very sturdy except for the drawers, which could have a little more support to hold in place but don't think they will fall out or anything. Had a friend's 16-year old put together for me.
