This fits on the counter but doesn't take up much space, and holds a surprising amount. Plus there is extra storage on the top of the cabinet. The doors and hinges are put on well, and all in all we were very pleased with this. It's a distressed gray right now but can be painted -- I'm going to be painting ours next week and was happy to see the hardware (hinges and handles) can be removed and re-installed after painting!",

                "reviewText": "This cabinet is the perfect size for storage in a small space, and it is an excellent value for the price (at least at the time of this writing). Mine even came with little foam pads in case you wanted to put them on the feet of the cabinet and protect the surface you place it on. The only thing that potential buyers should be aware of is that the inside of the cabinet smells strongly of wood, which may seep into whatever you store inside of it. I think that it\u2019s a nice smell and am very happy with my purchase.",
