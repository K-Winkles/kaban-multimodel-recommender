It takes longer then the 30 minutes it says but no longer than an hour. Some of the directions are weird but if I can figure it out anyone can. The material is cheap but nothing major. Definitely does the job and worth it. If I has a bigger wall space I would probably order another one. I wear a size 4-5 in kids and only was able to fit 3 sneakers at the top and then some sandals at the bottom. Not a lot of storage but it\u2019s cute and pretty sturdy.",

I had to use a mallet to push in some of the inner pieces and I could not for the life of me do it, my husband had to help me. The other difficult part was attaching the drawers to the said inner pieces; it was just a really tricky angle to see. Definitely have another person to help you once the drawers are ready to go in. I would definitely use the wall anchors even if you don't have little kids because it's a little mis-weighted.",

                "reviewText": "So I live in a compact apartment and a pile of shoes just inside the door doesn\u2019t work. This cabinet does the trick. Super cute, slim design is perfect, and just one cabinet works as it\u2019s just me and my shoes - although these photos of two look amazing. The price is ok for what it is, but honestly a bit high- keep reading for why.The downside? The instructions say it will take 30 minutes to put together, but with all the missing screws, it took 2 days so I could run to the hardware store. And the missing screws are not listed by their correct size; they are listed by some kind of serial number so finding the right screws was a bit of a chore. But at least with a few missing screws, I could match up to a screw that I had in my hand. The two that were completely missing were the only two and I had no idea the size. I had to improvise. Also the top of this is not secure. It will require some glue to keep it from coming off if I move it.All in all, I do like it and it\u2019s exactly what I needed in this small space. I\u2019m just not sure how long this piece of furniture will last or if the journey was totally worth the destination.",
