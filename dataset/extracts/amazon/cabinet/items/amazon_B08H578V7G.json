I believe all these cabinets in this price range would be of this quality, so no surprises here.UPDATE: After assembling this cabinet I raised the rating and would like to add that I'm impressed with the precision of all the components. With care and patience, it assembled seamless, perfect fit of all parts. All the panels were obviously CNC cut with tight tolerance. I added glue to all the dowels and it is super sturdy now. However, the press fiberboard is not durable.",

The color is perfect.The magnet that holds the doors is not great as the strength is weak; to mean one door will not hold latched to the magnet but just kinda \"balances\" there.Putting it together was a pain in the butt simply because the directions were overdone with do this - do that and it took almost 2 hours and I am a direction wiz.The drawers are not deep and that is okay but because they are short there is no balance for them when pulled out and that means you have to hold them or they will fall out. However, the stand itself is balanced and is level on the floor - no wobbles.The inside shelf is fine as all I have on it are DVDs. The pieces that are there to hold the shelf can be adjusted.Was it worth the money? No, not at all. At best it should be priced much lower.Will I keep it? Yes. For what I got it for it will simply do but if one is looking for something to constantly be in use in and out of then this stand/unit will make you quite grumpy.",
