This little cupboard was the perfect solution and we couldn't be happier with it. The assembly was painless and went together perfectly within an hour. All the pieces were in great shape and everything needed was included. There is a shelf inside that we keep light weight items on like hand weights, yoga blocks, and shoes. The bottom shelf is able to support 25 lb kettle and dumb bells with no issues at all. I also like the slatted doors because if anything gets put away that might be a little sweaty there is still some ventilation. We have purchased other items from this brand before and are always really satisfied with their quality.",

This shelf was easy to assemble, in fact the hardest part was the cabinet section. Once built however this thing is sturdy. It's not going anywhere. The shelves are roomy as well.If I had anything negative to say about it, and this isn't an issue for me but could be for others, it's that this shelf is small. I had assumed it would be larger but it ended up being about a foot shorter than I expected and about the same width shorter. Ended up perfect for me though at existing spec. It also arrived with a small dent in one of the metal side frames. It's hardly noticeable and didn't interfere with assembly or compromise the sturdiness in any way.If you need a cute, fashionable industrial style shelf for a smaller room, get this one...it's great.",

Thankfully a reviewer here noted that the wheels can come out longer if you use the screwdriver (thus the doors finally fit in the grooves, instead of falling out).It really is solid and quality. Laminated on all sides (even the sides you cannot see). They did not cheap-out on the design and worksmanship, (like so many do to save a few pennies). My advice though if you are going to purchase different pieces in this style is to order separately on different days. My order of 2 different items was lumped together in this software and so assigned a single tracking number. Only 1 arrived and I freaked out. But this software does not let you know about the other tracking numbers for the other pieces coming your way. It is a critical flaw in the Amazon App, which they have yet to de-bug. So only order 1 piece at a time to be sure the orders are not lumped together under a unified tracking number (which would be incorrect, as a result).",

It made the assembly go very fast without issue, but I could see if you were doing it manually with a screw driver that would be very difficult due to the fact there are no pre-drilled holes in the back. Other than that it is straight forward and easy to install.***Size*** Always go to product details and check the demensions, then measure out the area you are planning to put it in to make sure it's a good fit. I've read reviews saying it's too small, but that's your fault if you don't check specs before hand. This was a perfect fit for our area and allowed me to make a coffee bar along with soda storage and other snacks.Overall great purchase. Highly recommend.",
