Despite some review last to the contrary, I found assembly instructions to be easy to understand and accurate. I did end up with extra hardware but it was clearly included as extra; I felt more confident about that due to another person\u2019s review noting the same, so thanks to that person! This thing does need to be secured to the wall, as it will tip when you open the magnetic doors if you don\u2019t. But the included hardware did the job and all is well. Makes me smile every time I see it.",

                "reviewText": "This cabinet provides a lot of much needed storage for my tiny bathroom, but it is extremely wobbly and the instructions don\u2019t consider the fact you have to build it around a toilet. My recommendation is to read the instructions thoroughly before assembling and figure out what you need to build first so that you can install it around the toilet. Note that there\u2019s a step on the last page to secure the backing that is very difficult to do once the shelf is on the toilet. Once built, I was able to store a lot of items in here but it is still very wobbly and I am not able to secure it to the wall since I live in a rental. Additionally as I have molding around the floor of my bathroom, it cannot rest flush against the wall. IKEA shelves usually have a cutout back there for this, but this one did not.",

                "reviewText": "It was good quality and easy to assemble. I had to put the bottom part around the toilet then put the top part into the bottom part because it was too tall to just slid it down over the toilet. The only disadvantage is you cannot open the top of the toilet to fix something inside the tank, unless you disassemble the top part off the bottom part, which is not easy to do.",

Didn\u2019t list the measurements for the bottom back so it was too big to fit into our bathroom. Will have to un-assembled then re-assemble the bottom later in the bathroom!Wish I wouldn\u2019t have purchased this. Hopefully you have more luck!",
