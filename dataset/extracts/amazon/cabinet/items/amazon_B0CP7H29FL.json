                "reviewText": "For $110 you get a pretty sturdy four shelf cabinet with doors. It was not difficult to assemble, and took me about an hour. However, I'm a fairly handy retired electronic technician who has been putting Ikea furniture like this together for many years, so your experience may take a little longer. The instructions, as with many that come with this kind of thing, are just pictures. They are clear and precise however. All parts are clearly labeled, with a parts list so you can see what is what and how many of each you should have. They even include a bag of extra parts, various screws etc if you lose any while putting it together. If you look CLOSELY at the pics and match parts with procedures, you will be fine. Once you finish one of the last steps before you install the doors, that being screwing 12 small fasteners to tighten the whole back, it is sturdy and solid.So why only four stars? The main way the panels attach to one another is using these small round \"cams\" you insert a peg into and tighten 180 degrees to lock it and make it secure. About half of the time, they are so poorly made that you can't turn them completely 180 degrees. You get a little more than 90 degrees and it won't go any further. A few of them I tried to force all the way. Once in a while with a HUGE amount of force, they would indeed tighten all the way, and lock as they were designed to do. However, many would not do that. What are the consequences of that? Probably not much. If you tighten as much as you can, although it didn't turn completely 180 degrees to lock, it seemed to be tight. Once all was put together, is seems just as sturdy as it should be. I suppose the only problem could possibly be that since they were not turned in all the way and didn't lock as they should, that at some point they could work loose. At that point the panels may become loose. If you look closely at the cams, which are in my hand in the pic, you can see that the fit and finish of some of them is crude, with a bit of metal flashing that prevents them from operating as they should. Again... I don't think this would be a problem in the long run.I decided not to install the doors, as where I'm using this, opening and closing them would not be feasible. So I'm using it just as a cabinet with shelves to store electronic gadgets.",
