We have assembled MANY products over the years, and while some claim to be \"easy to assemble\", they are anything but. It took us about an hour, but all the pieces were clearly marked, and the directions were very clear and even included directions on how to adjust the cabinet doors to ensure they align correctly. Love this addition to our home and kudos to RiverRidge for making this so easy to put together. If I needed more cabinets, I would definitely order from them.",
