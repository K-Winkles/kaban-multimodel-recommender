                "reviewText": "This was easier to assemble than some of the others have said (one saying \"5 hours\", which mine was nothing like that), but not \"super easy\" as some have reported. For me, it was somewhere in between.First, the condition of the box contents ... the box arrived in good shape, no apparent abuse, no dents or rips or whatever. The box tells you not to worry if it's beaten up because the contents will be OK. Well, I will believe that the contents would survive a lot of abuse in transit, but it won't help if the stuff is already damaged before it's ever packaged, which is what I believe has happened. The contents are in a thick corrugate box with 3 standard packing straps, and inside all of the flat panels are arranged efficiently and sandwiched between two 1/8\" thick sturdy dense particle board sheets, which will be enough to protect it. Around all of the edges are some good solid metal L-shaped edge protectors that will take the abuse instead of the cabinet components. These things were a great idea, though I guess I'll see if I can take them to the local recycling yard to put into the scrap metal bin so they aren't wasted because that's a lot of extra metal.The panels on the outsides were undamaged. It was just two of the panels sandwiched between others that had large dents on the edges (not on the big surfaces), which HAD to have already taken place before packaging because there was no damage between that and the outside of the box and no way anything inside could have made such a large dent. One of these was the left cabinet side along the top, right where it actually created a serious problem for attaching the top front cross bar because the dent was pushing into the area where the parts of the cross bar have to be. It took me a good long time with a couple of sets of pliers to carefully shape this back to where it could be assembled. The other dent was the edge of one of the shelves, and that wasn't impacting the ability to assemble, and was easier to shape back to normal with the pliers. That edge went to the back so that the imperfections caused by correcting the dent aren't visible. The miscut hole is just a manufacturing defect that seems too common with assemble-it-yourself furniture and fixtures. The dented pieces that had to have happened before packaging is really not excusable though. Quality control and handling at the manufacturer's facility is obviously not good enough, and I see that some others have complained of damaged parts.Aside from this there was one defect where a screw hole should be accessible behind another piece of metal on the same panel (two metal sheets on the panel, the top one with a cutout and a screwhole in the 2nd supposedly right behind the cutout) -- the cutout wasn't lining with the screwhole so I had to use a punch and hammer to make it work, which it did in the end. What if someone didn't have all of these extra tools that I have?As for assembly, I had to consult a video that someone linked on this product page which shows two men assembling this cabinet. One part was *NOT* (!!!!) explained correctly in the instructions and the video cleared that issue right up. First, the instructions are just stupid on the first part of the assembly, It has you assembling it upright, which is damned hard to get things lined up while it's standing. Laying the parts down as if it's being assembled with its back to the ground makes a lot more sense and makes lining everything up easier. It does have you lay it down around whichever step has you dealing with the top panel. Just assemble it entirely laying down even before this and it goes much easier.In fact, for step 6 it has you putting the bottom crossbar in, but not the screws, then putting the bottom panel on that crossbar and THEN putting 4 screws in. Problem is, now with the bottom panel on, you can only get at 2 of the 4 screws and it doesn't tell you how to get to the other 2. It asks you to put the 4 in and then later you're laying the unit down on its back. The men in the video assembled it on its back all along, and that was where you can see that when it's laying down, those other 2 screw holes are accessible from underneath the cabinet. So bad (!!) BAD instructions!! Anyway, other than these issues with the instructions, the only thing that was a constant annoyance was in trying to get a normal sized screwdriver with a normal handle to lay flat enough in places to install various screws, because the holes are right next to a panel and so close to it that your screwdriver is almost certainly at a slight angle so that it's trying to drive the screw into the hole at an angle as well. This takes some finessing to get it to go in straight.That's it with the issues, though. It didn't take a second person. I'm not Superman, but it wasn't hard at all to lift it back upright when needed and it wasn't the worst project for needing 3 or 4 hands. Virtually all of it was possible to line things up and attach a screw with just your two hands. I did assemble it myself.In the end, it's also pretty sturdy, and for the $200 it's fine. You're not going to get a thick-walled industrial-grade cabinet with the high quality locking mechanism for $200. This is about as good as it gets for that much, and it's just what I needed for keeping some office supplies better organized.",

Fortunately it was in places that would really not be seen, I wish there was an option for the doors to be black instead of grey, but for the price I paid I was willing to settle. And my office is purple (with hint of black/grey).Putting it together was hard also, guess because I did it by myself my nuggets kept barking at it, it took up there favorite place \ud83d\ude0a I hope its sturdy because while putting it together it didn\u2019t feel that strong.Seriouly shouldn\u2019t take this most time putting it together and the plastic clip should been black or grey instead of white but hopefully once I put items inside they wont be seen. This is the main reason I gave the rate I did. I need another and I wont be getting the same one I\u2019ll go some where else.",
