                "reviewText": "I am a 61 year young woman of not too good of health and I put this together myself. I paced myself so it took me about 4 hours, but I was careful to be prepared by laying everything out and grabbing my rubber mallot and electric screwdriver (I have a nice blister on my hand from hand screwing the screws in so use gloves). The instructions say not to use an electric screwdriver but I did it carefully anyway, with no problems. If you go slow and concentrate, you should have no problems. The doors even lined up perfectly upon completion. Note: have some Elmer's or wood glue handy for the dowels. Grab a rubber mallot. Don't use the wall anchors unless you are in an earthquake zone, and then you will have to drill holes for them as there are no predrilled holes for the wall brackets/anchors. I wish it was taller, but it is still a nice cabinet.",

Looks nice in my kitchen and is small enough to add space without being in the way. If I had room, I\u2019d probably buy another one!! I\u2019m probably overloading the shelves. I think the limit was only 11lbs per shelf. We\u2019ll see! One day I\u2019ll get it organized but it\u2019s doing a great job hiding my pantry items for now.",
