                "reviewText": "We got this in black to complement some antique Asian painted bookshelves in our library, and it's a beautiful addition. The storage space and size make it a very versatile piece with many potential uses. There were only a few small nicks to the finish that were easily touched up with a fine black Sharpie. One person can assemble it, but it takes a long time as there are a lot of steps. You'll need to create your own drill holes to screw on the back panels or the screws may go in crooked as the wood is solid, which adds more time. I appreciate that stickers that match assembly directions are strategically placed so they will be hidden when fully assembled, so they're not necessary to remove. If you want to remove them, most will not come off easily and will require Goo Gone. If I'd realized this earlier in the assembly process, it would have taken me 3 hours instead of 4 hours to assemble. It was worth the effort, and I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "We needed a storage cabinet and had been shopping at the local furniture store for several weeks. I was reluctant to pay $700+ for a decent piece of furniture. This SIMPLIHOME Connaught Table was about half the price, so long as I was willing to spend the time to assemble. No brainer as I am pretty handy.The cabinet came very well packed, no damage whatsoever. Upon inspecting the pieces I was surprised that it is truly solid wood as advertised, (expect the masonite type back). I would say similar size cabinets in the furniture stores often have some pieces that are not even solid wood like this one.Assembly takes some time, but is not difficult if you can follow instructions. I did use a power drill to start pilot holes and to attach screws that cover the back of the unit. The only slight problem was the pins that mount in the inside pre-drilled holes. The holes are slightly undersized compared to the pins. I had to enlarge these holes slightly.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't find this very hard to assemble, good instructions. Looks very nice. Drawback is the wood and finish is very soft so dents easy. Mine came with right door scratches but not seen when closed - so kept it. Don't know how it happened because it was packaged very well. I'm satisfied with the product and its perfect size.",

                "reviewText": "The description says SOLID WOOD, but this is VERY MISLEADING. At least half of it is definitely manufactured wood and super cheap quality. And whatever is real wood is not very good quality. While it does look nice from a far, the finish on the pieces does dent and chip easily.I purchased the Amazon team to assemble it for me (they were GREAT!) but the end product, while it all fits together - isn't very sturdy. Mine is a bit wobbly so I'll have to put something under the legs. I'm also not sure if it's worth disassembling, trying to fit it all back in the box to ship it back.In general, this piece is NOT WORTH THE MONEY. You can find other similar pieces of furniture that are better quality - even though they aren't made out of \"solid wood\", that are more reasonably priced.",

As other reviewers mentioned, it was hard to get them level, which makes them difficult to open and close. The wood has 2 areas that appear almost wavy, and it scratches very easily. I'm keeping it, as it fits my space well and looks ok, but if I were buying again I think I'd make another choice.",
