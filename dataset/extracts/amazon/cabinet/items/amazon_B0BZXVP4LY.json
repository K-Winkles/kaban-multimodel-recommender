                "reviewText": "I am unsure of how to reach the seller, I have looked and do not see a way to reach the seller to discuss when buying a pair the second cabinets do not match as I have seen in another review. I purchased a pair of them to make one entertainment center console for my TV. It is unfortunate that it is the main focal point of the room. The cabinets are two different shades when you buy them in a pair. Other than that, I think these are such beautiful cabinets. It\u2019s a shame that my eyes are drawn to the different colors. You can see that one of the cabinets come with just tan woven rattan doors & the second set comes with green and brown and light rattan weaved into it instead of just tan to match the other. I don\u2019t mind either color I just would like it to be consistent. In the pictures, the cabinet on the left has greens and browns and different colors weaved into the door and the cabinet on the right just has tan rattan weaved together. I have included many pictures of them, and I have included separate pictures of them. This is just for others to be aware that when you buy them as a pair, they may not come the same color. But wow, they really are beautiful, easy to put together, the perfect height and I love them! Also, they came so carefully packaged and padded that, despite the driver putting holes in the box, they were still in perfect condition. And not at all cheap and awful looking when you take them out of the box as I saw another review. This is one of the best fake wood cabinets I\u2019ve ever seen when it comes to sturdiness and the condition of the wood.!",

It is not real wood but does not look cheap, so if you\u2019re looking for the natural look, this is it. It\u2019s a light wood and color is true to the pictures.It was very simple to put together and feels sturdy. I keep mentioning price but for the cost, I\u2019m very impressed.The inside has three adjustable shelves that can be moved around, we used it as a game cabinet which was super functional for us. As you can see in the photo we were able to fill it so it has a lot of space for it\u2019s size.I\u2019d buy again! Don\u2019t sleep on this one.",
