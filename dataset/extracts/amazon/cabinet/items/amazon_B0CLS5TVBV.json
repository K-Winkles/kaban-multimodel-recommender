                "reviewText": "Specifically bought this cabinet because it stated it had a deeper drawer for bigger shoes. Barely fits size 10 women\u2019s shoes (half of drawer is unusable unless I turn the shoes sideways) and doesn\u2019t fit size 11 men\u2019s. The drawers are very heavy when shoes are in it and it feels like it is going to fall over. Disappointed with quality and took forever to put together. Part of the leg also came missing so it wobbles. Would not recommend.",
