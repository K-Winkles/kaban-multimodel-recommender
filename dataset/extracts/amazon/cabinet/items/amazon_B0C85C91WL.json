Just snapping pieces together.You have some leeway and flexibility to assemble the boxes how you want. However keep in mind the walls are shared between the boxes so you cannot make 6 separate boxes.I wanted a open design so I opted to not use the door handle and left the back open. Also no top wall to make it easier to put my shoes/slippers and fit taller shoes. I was worried this might affect stability but to my surprise it's very stable and has little to no wobble.Overall quite happy with this and priced at $50, it was really affordable.",

                "reviewTitle": "Modular shoe cabinet but a few shortcomings leave me unimpressed",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. What's included:- Shoe cabinet- Assembly instructionsThe shoe cabinet by the Arkyomi Store offers a modular approach to organizing ones shoes.ASSEMBLYThis item requires all aspects of it to be assembled. There are a large number of panels and connectors that are required to be attached together and it took me considerable time to put it together.The panels are different sizes depending on how they are used. For example, the way I built the cabinet, the depth of each panel is 12\" while the width is 15\". Compartments can be large or small depending on how one chooses to piece things together. As my pictures show I used a combination of both to allow for both boots and shoes to be stored in the cabinet.Each panel is snapped into a plastic connector that holds each piece in place. While this works, its not the most stable and as my video demonstrates the who cabinet wobbles especially when there is not alot of shoes in the cabinet, but even filled, it would still wobble.The other thing I would point out about assembly is that although its possible customize shelf height and compartment sizes, there are no real preset levels one can use to guide the placing of shelves meaning that I had to get out a small level instrument to make sure I was placing shelves in the compartments in a straight and level manner.MATERIALSThe materials of this cabinet are all plastic and polypropylene (PP). The panels are all made of PP and it sort of feels like the surface of a drum's skin. I did tear a small part of one of the panels when I was building the cabinet.I also do not like the way the levels can bow somewhat when a heavier shoe is place on a panel due to this kind of material being used. It just doesn't look good.Additionally, the legs are plastic and are snapped into place. The problem I have with this aspect of the cabinet is that the legs can pop off, and if you try to push or drag the cabinet to another location (as I did) then its possible that a leg can pop off (which happened to me). There is no real way to secure the legs in place, other than to snap them into a connector.PERIPHERALSI do give alot of credit for the inclusion of a hanger that can be used with the cabinet. The hanger allows for several items to be hung it which adds further utility to this cabinet. I have put a few light items on this, careful not to hang anything too heavy which might cause a slight imbalance when there are few to no shoes on the cabinet. I also like that its possible to lay items on the top which also increases the utility of the cabinet.FURTHER LIMITATIONSThe one thing I did not do, was to use the doors, and there is a simple reason for this. Its not because I did not want to add the doors to the cabinet, but more because our shoes would not fit in the compartments unless (as I show in my video), we turn the shoes sideways, which is possible but then realy reduces the number of shoes that can be placed into the cabinet.As a result, I decided to forgo the doors altogether which I feel is a cleaner look than having some doors not close properly, but that's a personal choice I made.FINAL THOUGHTSOverall, the cabinet is not bad, but there are limitations and the quality of the material is not as sturdy or durable as others. I do like the fact that this can be built in several ways depending on my personal preferences of what works best for me. At the same time, there is alot of imprecision and wobble and just a generally lower quality feel to the cabinet that caused me to place this out of the way in the mud room.If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I probably would have passed on this and looked for alternatives, but it can offer some utility.Cheers,",
