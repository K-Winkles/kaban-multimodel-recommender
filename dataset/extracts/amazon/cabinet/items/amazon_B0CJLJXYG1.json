They offered a refund but I would rather get the missing parts instead, as I stated cabinets are nice. I am changing my review to 4 stars.The cabinets are actually very nice and we ordered two. One came without any hardware and directions. I contacted seller and they asked me for the photos, which I provided right away. I never heard from them again. Decided to return it.",
