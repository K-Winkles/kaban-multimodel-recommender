The silver knobs look great, and it fits the space I had perfectly.Downsides are that the paint at the edges seems to chip easily, and it could fit together more beautifully, though really it's not bad! Assembly is moderately involved, similar to an ikea dresser or nightstand. A bit more than I'd like, but not difficult.",

For the price I paid, I\u2019m not super impressed with the quality. All of the pieces arrived unharmed, which is great. The drawer and pullout cabinet on the bottom are not incredible. The drawer is very small and does not have any tracks, so it drops as you pull it out. The cabinet piece does not slide super easily and is a bit loud, it does the job, but I really wouldn\u2019t recommend this for much other than storing toilet paper.",

                "reviewText": "I have a very narrow gap between wall & dresser, plus a need for more storage. This bathroom cabinet was the most appropriate item on Amazon. It is very well-packaged. Not gonna lie, it was minor hell to assemble. Yes, the drawings were very good, each cabinet piece is tagged, all hardware is separately bagged & tagged. But there are so many pieces, so many different screws & bolts, so many tiny things that fall, bounce away & are forever lost. My advice to the not-construction savvy: put all hardware in a basket, along w/ tools. Keep everything together, always. Don\u2019t open packets until needed. If you need to reposition a bolt & it\u2019s hard to retrieve from tight apertures, use a magnet. Pulls those pesky bolts out so you can micro-align them. Also, kudos to manufacturer for including extra screws to replace the one that bounced away.",
