Some of the stickers fell off which made trying to find the right pieces to put together took longer than it should\u2019ve. Then came to the realization you are given no extra screws or pins. Other furnitures and shelves I\u2019ve order on Amazon seemed to give extra screws just in case. Not these folks. The quality of the wood (if can call it wood) was okay. A little wrapped but you get what you pay for. Would I purchase from these guys or this brand again? Hard no, even if this was half the price of what I\u2019m looking for.",
