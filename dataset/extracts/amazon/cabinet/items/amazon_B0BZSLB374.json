                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the VASAGLE Bathroom Floor Storage Cabinet, and I must say, it has been a game changer for my small bathroom. This storage cabinet is perfect for small spaces that need a bright and fresh look.One of the first things that caught my attention about this product is how pleasing it is to the eyes. The clean white color and sleek design instantly added a touch of elegance to my bathroom. It blends seamlessly with my existing decor and enhances the overall look and feel of my small bathroom space for an instant transformation!The storage space provided by this cabinet is impressive. With multiple shelves and drawers, I was able to neatly organize all my bathroom essentials. The drawers glide in and out easily, making accessing items a breeze. I no longer have to rummage through cluttered cabinets to find what I need \u2013 everything is right at my fingertips.In addition to its functionality, this storage cabinet is a nice heavy piece. It feels sturdy and well-built, which gives me confidence in its durability. The included anti-tip kit is a thoughtful addition, especially if you have an uneven floor.

                "reviewText": "This cabinet is small, 11.8 x 23.6 x 31.5 inches. Once assembled, you end up with a little cabinet with 3 relatively small drawers, an adjustable inner shelf (5 options), a door, another shelf and top. Yes, it's small, but so is the price. It may be a little challenging to assemble by yourself (I love the challenge), but it's not too hard. The only reason I slashed a star is because I do not see this able to withstand humidity in a bathroom. It has some decent amount of storage place for any restroom basic needs.",

I was relieved to see the parts were labeled with a letter and I matched them to the manual. This helped me find the parts so much faster. Everything was so easy after that. Everything fit so easily and it took me 3 hours. But that\u2019s because I REALLY double and triple checked A lot of steps since I was new to assembling. I love my furniture piece. Oh I also love the way the doors close, so smooth.",
