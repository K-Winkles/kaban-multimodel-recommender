                "reviewText": "I have assembled many furniture pieces (and I hate it!) I think this cabinet had the easiest instructions ever. My only complaint about assembly is none of the pieces were labeled but I\u2019m being a stickler because regardless it was easy. It was insanely heavy and once it was assembled I had to call someone to help me get it upright.Overall it looks good but the door handles are very low on it and I think it looks weird plus they are plastic handles. I am going to wallpaper the cabinet and bring the new handles I bought higher.One more thing I need to mention is this cabinet MUST BE ANCHORED TO THE WALL or it might tip and as I mentioned it\u2019s extremely heavy. The backing is cardboard so you won\u2019t be anchoring it thru that. I had to order separate wall anchors for this because I can\u2019t do it thru the top because of where I\u2019m placing it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this shelf just yesterday and set it up on my own in just a couple of hours. It\u2019s so easy to put together! I went a little different than what the instructions said due to lack of work space, but even then it was so easy to tell what to do and then easy to do it. I really liked that it used normal screws and nails because it really helps hold it together. Guide holes were a bonus! My only real issue with it was how easy it was to tip over, but it came with a piece to attach between the unit and the wall in order to prevent tipping, so great planning on the manufacturer\u2019s part. So definitely use that piece. I\u2019d also love if it had a couple more shelves to put inside, but that\u2019s personal preference lol. But yes, overall it\u2019s wonderful! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked.",

                "reviewText": "This arrived yesterday and I put it together this morning. I could kick myself for not wiping down each piece and inspecting it before putting it together. The way it goes together requires you to put the doors on the floor and build it up from there, which is different from any other I've ever built. As a result, there were some things I didn't even notice until I put it together. I stood it up and started wiping it down with a dust cloth, but many of the spots I thought were dust and packaging turned out to be scratches, some of them big, all over the front doors. It was built on a special wool covering that I use when building furniture just to make sure I don't scratch anything, so I know it wasn't me. Then when I wiped down one of the sides, close to the bottom I noticed a huge scratch going all the way across. When I got close to it I realized it was more than just a scratch; it was a crack in the particle board all the way across it!! I never even saw it. That was the side that attached to the doors first and the way it was facing, I wasn't looking at that side. So now I have this thing put together that not only looks bad, but is structurally unsound. I tried clicking on the link they have to contact ClosetMaid if we have any issue, but each time I've tried, I get the message that it can't be found. I'm not even sure what to do at this point. The box was thrown out this morning and it is put together, so how can I even return it to Amazon? I will try to add pics or video to this review. UPDATE: Amazon Customer Service made it right for me.",
