                "reviewText": "I was assembling a raffle submission for a memorial golf tournament. I had six bottles of nice wine that I decided would look a little feeble just standing on the table; plus, I didn't want the corks to dry out over the course of the day. I actually stumbled upon this rack from Amazon and decided it was perfect. And it was perfect! It's very, very easy to assemble. It is stylish with a slightly modern flair but will ease into just about any home or bar. The two trays stack well and sturdily. Each tray has handles for easy carrying, and the bottles fit snugly in the keepers, so there's no accidental rolling or dropping.The man who won my raffle item was thrilled with this wine rack (he knew nothing about wine and bid on behalf of his wife). When I pointed out all the features, he was even happier. A side story is that my friend who was running the raffle liked the looks and features of this wine rack so much, that she absconded with the box so she could find it on Amazon. Oh well. All in all, everyone was very happy with this little wine rack. And by the way, you can keep adding to it with a sigh of relief that the additional racks (unless you're reaching for the top of the Eiffel Tower) will seat securely on the two trays that come in the box.",

                "reviewText": "Overall I quite like it. 4.5 out of 5. It does a good job for organizing the bottles. It's sturdy and well manufactured, everything was straight and cut well. Only a couple of jagged edges which is par for the course when dealing with bamboo, after removing the splinters everything is fine.Negatives:- It's just a bit too small for my larger bottles, they can still fit on the top rack but not next to each other.- It's silly that it comes with a cheap screwdriver. The whole point of buying bamboo is that I want less disposable plastic junk in the world, but they stick this cheap screwdriver in the package that I just am going to have to throw away. If you try to use this screwdriver I can pretty much guarantee you will strip the screws. But really who doesn't own a screwdriver? The screws themselves are of good quality.",
