                "reviewText": "While my primary bathroom is pretty large, it was designed by the previous homeowner as a high-accessibility space. That's great, but it also makes the space extremely inefficient from ergonomic and storage standpoints. I got the UTEX Bathroom Cabinet Organizer (White) to help alleviate this issue.The cabinet arrives as a flat-pack box, with everything protected with styrofoam blocks and foam sheets. Most (or all) of the panels are MDF, but it's nicely finished. Assembly took me about 20 minutes, but I wasn't in a hurry. There isn't much hex hardware, but you will still benefit from using your own hand tools. The material and finish quality is good for the price. The cheapest part of the whole piece are the exposed hinges. They're self-closing, but they look like they're from a 1980's kitchen. I didn't like the included knobs, so I sourced some from a local hardware store. I've also ordered the same hinge style in brushed gold, to better match the hardware in the rest of the bathroom. The only cheesy part of the design is that two of the sheets at the back of the cabinet are joined with an I-channel plastic strip. The other seam is hidden with a fixed shelf. Also, there are plastic caps foe most of the exposed hardware, though those aren't present in the vendor photos on the product listing. Weird.While the legs of the cabinet allow space for a baseboard, my particular bathroom also had a strip of quarter round transitioning the baseboard to the tile floor. That extra 1/2\" was enough for the open toilet lid to hit the cabinet, rather than the toilet tank. I chiseled the quarter round so the cabinet could sit flush to the wall. Clearance isn't an issue now. I have to admit that I'm a little concerned about the MDF construction, since it's an area around water. Aside from the remote chance that something could happen with the toilet, there's also just the water from mopping the floor. To try to address that, I'll be caulking the legs to the floor.I'm frankly shocked that the UTEX cabinet is only $106. I would have been willing to pay up to $200 for this level of quality. If the cabinet had hidden hinges, I would have been willing to pay even more. As-is, though, this cabinet is a really good value. I'll update this review if I have any issues with the MDF in this product. Highly Recommended",

Packaging was excellent and provided good protection for all pieces. No damage at all. Very sturdy after final assembly. This unit is solid and heavy. I set the base in place first and then brought up the cabinet without the doors attached. After I put the anchors in I attached the doors. Suggest putting felt tip pads on the back corner edges to prevent scratching the wall when putting the unit behind the toilet and lining things up. Also get some thicker rubber bumper pads to soften and quit the doors when closing. Overall very satisfied.",
