                "reviewText": "So far so good with this entertainment center! It fits my apartment perfectly and was relatively easy to assemble alone. It\u2019s definitely small, so if you\u2019re looking to fill anything besides an apartment or kid\u2019s room, I\u2019d reccomend something higher quality and larger.For what it is, quality seems as good as the price. It\u2019s not authentic wood; it\u2019s laminate print over pulp sheets. If you\u2019re looking for crate & barrel style on a budget, this is for you!As far as assembly goes, I was able to do it alone (small 22 yo female) with my handy tool kit that my father was so sure I would need (and he was right). I added a picture of the tools I needed that it didn\u2019t come with. some of the screws go in ended up needing a smaller barrel so that\u2019s important to note. Also the Allen wrench provided didn\u2019t do much, my attatchment was much more efficient. I put it together over the course of a day, but some of the instructions aren\u2019t that clear. The jokes didn\u2019t bother me so much, but after some trial and error it ended up working out pretty well. I forgot to put the back piece on in step 7 (the most complicated/confusing step), but it all worked out in the end. For being a millennial/gen z cusper I like to think of myself as pretty handy, but it might help to have clearer and less concise instructions.As far as it looks, I think it\u2019s nice but in some spots you can tell it\u2019s not real wood. The doors look and authentic from arms length, but the bottom apron/legs look a lil plastic. Oh well, for the price I\u2019m couldn\u2019t ask for much better!",

                "reviewText": "I mostly like the outcome. However, the instructions were not the best and there were a few nails and wooden stubs missing to build. The legs and some pieces of the main stand were peeling back and not quality. Much of it is able to be hidden and the item was too big to want to return IMO. I would HIGHLY suggest having two people to build. There are many times you will need to hold pieces together, rotate/flip the furniture, and the instructions do not make the process easier. Enjoy the pic of the final outcome! ALSO\u2026 I am kind of annoyed that the handles are not gold but are rose gold, borderline orange. They are advertised in the label and photos as a gold, with more a yellow tint. The handles are 100% rose gold. I put something gold next to the handle for reference.",

                "reviewText": "Look and design: I\u2019m really happy with the design - our theme is white and maple so it blends well with everything. I\u2019m glad that they opted for no hardware - hardware makes the furniture unnecessarily more expensive. The white part of the table looks semi glossy and somehow it looks and feel expensive. The other parts seems OK.Materials and build: Be mindful that you get what you pay for, the furniture is definitely not hardwood. However I think the main parts are hard enough to withstand the weight of our TV with enough support to keep it from falling apart or dipping. After screwing the top part, it was solid. My main point: it\u2019s sturdy enough for a TV plus some accessories (what it is designed for) but not enough for anything heavier. (note: our TV is 43\", for your visual reference)Putting it together: So most of the negative reviews are about bad instructions. My take on it is although the manual\u2019s verbal instructions are crap, you should be OK if you just follow the visual instructions . Simple rules apply - (1) good material out and hide the raw parts, (2) line up the parts first before screwing things together and (3) be patient, you\u2019re not a full-time furniture maker so you\u2019ll make mistakes. I took about 1-1.5 hours to put this together but that\u2019s partly cause I was watching a movie while working on this and mid-way the table becomes quite heavy for me and didn\u2019t want to scratch the surfaces. I made a couple of mistakes, but it was no big deal. The hardest part was making sure the back lined up well and screwing the top part.Price: Good enough as brand new though I must confess, I got a \u201clike-new\u201d used. Zero problems with it even if it\u2019s a return. I got all the parts and nothing is broken.",
