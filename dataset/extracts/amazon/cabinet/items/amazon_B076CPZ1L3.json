                "reviewText": "I really love my cabinet! It took me a few days to put together since I did most of it alone. You\u2019ll likely need help turning it over as well as standing it up when you get to those steps. It went smoothly for the most part. If you try to do it all in one setting it might stress you out, but it\u2019s easy if you just follow the instructions and really pay attention to the diagrams and check them off as you complete them, doing the work over a few days. Based on several bad reviews I was nervous but mine came with only 2-3 very small dings in the wood that you can barely notice and as for the uneven cabinet issue people mention\u2026 my cabinet doors are straight because I had someone hold the cabinet up and I also put a small piece of folded cardboard from the box up under it while the person was holding it in place as I screwed in each door hinge taking care to not over screw so the door would stay put where the door could easily open and close. If you over screw it, the door moves out of place and out of alignment.I did have to make a run to Lowes to get a drill bit and a drill. Using an electronic drill with the Phillips head really helped on most of the screws (on low power and not over doing it because you can destroy the screw top or strip the screw. I had to buy a replacement screw when I did that!) trying to use a basic screw driver was a very tough task that required more strength (maybe because I\u2019m a woman, lol) but either way I chose to work smarter not harder so the electric route made everything go a lot smother and faster for sure. You\u2019ll also need a hammer for at certain times as well.I\u2019m very happy with the heaviness and overall quality of the cabinet and it looks more expensive than it is. Classy piece of furniture that works well in the living room, bedroom, basement or wherever you put it as long as it\u2019s up against a wall. I got the dark cabinet and everyone who sees it just loves it and ask where I got it. The storage capacity and possibilities are truly endless! Your home can be more clean, organized and minimalist with this cabinet. I\u2019m glad I ignored the bad reviews this time! Lol. \ud83d\udcaf\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Is it cheaply manufactured furniture that I could kick apart with a modicum of effort? Also yes. Do I possess the skills or ambition to custom build my own dream pantry? No. So for the price point, it is a fantastic storage addition to my formerly pantry-less kitchen. I like the organizational outcome enough to feel inspired to share a photo.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A very nice cabinet, but a lot of work to assemble",
                "reviewText": "I make my own eLiquid for vaping, so I have a lot of fairly small bottles of flavorings that need to be stored upright, gallon jugs of VG and PG, and the delicate lab equipment needed to accurately measure and mix these ingredients. Until I purchased this cabinet, all this stuff was all over the place, stored in various makeshift containers that weren't really suitable. When I saw this cabinet on Amazon, I thought it'd be perfect for my particular storage needs - a single unit where I could keep everything in one place, and keep all my equipment stored safely. Happily, the cabinet was everything I'd hoped it would be, and then some. I'm able to store ALL my gear in a single place, with room to spare.I recognized right away, though, that the cabinet could become top-heavy, and thus a hazard for falling over. At the same time, I didn't want to install the keeper strap, as doing so would prevent me from moving the cabinet easily for cleaning behind/under it, so I compromised by storing heavy books and the gallon jugs on the bottom shelves to keep the unit's center of gravity low to the floor and mitigate the risk of falling over. The books are really heavy and won't be removed from the cabinet while the upper shelves contain materials and equipment. That's not the solution for everyone; it just happens to work in my particular case. It'd be really easy to overload the upper shelves without counterweighting the lower shelves, making the unit a risk for becoming unstable when the doors were opened and thus tipping over onto the person that opened the door. It's probably a really good idea to install that strap under normal usage.I was concerned when the unit arrived - the outer shrink-wrap had been torn extensively, and the protective cardboard corner pieces where coming out. Fortunately, though, the inner box was still in one piece, so nothing inside was damaged and there were no missing pieces. That being said, one needs to VERY carefully inspect all the wood pieces against breakage in case the unit was dropped or handled roughly during shipping in a manner that wouldn't show obvious damage on the outer packaging and wrappings. Also, the UPS delivery man knocked on my door, saying he needed help offloading the box and moving it to my door; if I hadn't been at home when he arrived, he indicated he wouldn't have attempted to move the box by himself and would have taken it back to the depot to arrange a time with me so I could be there to assist him. That was kind of odd; I never had a delivery man say that before, but he was right that the box was too heavy for one person to move.Before moving on to assembly, I should also note that this is a complex piece of furniture that gives you the flexibility of having the shelf door on the left or right. To accommodate this, there are HUNDREDS of precision-drilled holes all over the pieces that make up this unit. These pieces are mass-produced, and after so many, the drills and hole-saws and auger bits that make these precision holes get dull, so they're actually 'tearing' out wood instead of cutting it cleanly, which can have a big impact on 'surface' wood being torn away, exposing the composite wood underneath, and this could wind up being exposed in your finished cabinet. My unit showed quite a bit of this condition, but fortunately, the exposed composite was small enough to be covered over by other pieces.To assemble the unit, you need a wide-open area, preferably carpeted, or covered by a blanket or even the flattened shipping box to protect the cabinet's finish as you assemble it. From experience, these pieces are delicate, and easily scratched or nicked during assembly, so take as much care as possible to protect the pieces during this stage. Try to assemble the unit as close as possible to its final location; it's heavy and bulky, so have plenty of help and be sure to protect the unit and walls/doors if you have to assemble it elsewhere and then move it to the final spot.Assembly was actually quite simple. The pieces are all clearly marked, the instruction manual was actually quite helpful, and the hardware bag was really well done - clearly marked and all pieces accounted for. There's a bit of room for improvement - calling out the shelves with lips to make sure they're installed correctly comes to mind, but generally the instructions were clear and easy to follow. I had difficulties with only two things - the 'big' door hinges were HARD to install and adjust properly, and the cabinet base design makes it difficult to adjust the support feet and and leveling pads. Mine was going to a tiled floor, and quite a bit of adjustment was necessary to get the cabinet properly leveled. That process actually took more time than it did to assemble the cabinet, and was made longer by having to lever the cabinet up to gain access to the leveling pads. After it was all done, though, the cabinet sat solidly, no rocking, and both doors were evenly seated and closing properly. Assembly was quick and fairly easy, but the Devil, as they say, lies in the detail work of fitting the cabinet to its final resting place.One other thing to consider is how delicate the finish is on these composite wood pieces. They nick and scratch easily as you're handling them, so consider investing in some filler/coloring products to cover over any ouchies after you're done. The pieces are really dusty too, so a good cleaning and polishing throughout is essential before loading it up.All said, I'm pretty satisfied overall with this Sauder product, though I believe there could have been better quality control during the manufacturing phase with the hole drilling. As long as you understand that assembling this cabinet is going to be a several-hour investment, and prepare your work space beforehand, and follow the instructions carefully, you shouldn't have any problems. You will need a drill to drill holes, but that's a minimal thing, and you can do the rest with hand tools.Hope you found this review helpful if you're considering purchasing this unit.",

After completed, it is a sturdy, heavy cabinet. Make sure to secure to wall because it could harm a child. (They provide strap and screw) the storage is wonderful, I'm using to store my grandkids games, toys and craft supplies.",

I was very upset to see 3 main pieces broken inside.Same night I went to manufacturer site to see if they can be replaced. Filled out form, very simple one, and ta-da! In the morning I got email that replacement parts were shipped?! That is a one of a kind customer service! Thanks!!! I got parts in 2 days, and In 4 more hours I finished putting this cabinet together ( yeah, pretty much by myself).",

That fact may have been the reason for the number of marks on the cabinet, or maybe it was just a poor finish. Either way I have about 8 blemishes on my new cabinet, not huge but definitely noticeable. Unfortunately I needed it asap and it is quite heavy so returning it would also have been awkward and frustrating. If I had not had these problems I would rate it a 5 and change value for the money to a 5. Ease of assembly, well we had issues with the boards lining up as intended so the 3 remains.",

All the screws and stuff are in a labeled bag.The only problem I have is with the door that has the shelving on it. We\u2019ve had this unit for a month now and the door is no longer on straight. I attached a picture so you can see what I mean. Now the bottom of the door hits the edge and the bottom. I didn\u2019t notice when I first closed the door today(July 26) so there is a scratch on the bottom from me trying to close it a few times. I will see if my husband can do anything without taking the whole door apart. I might just have to live with it",
