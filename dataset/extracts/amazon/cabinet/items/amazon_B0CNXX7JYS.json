                "reviewText": "We have a short hallway between our kitchen and dining room. I ordered one of these units after going to IKEA, Living Spaces, and At Home finding pieces that were either too deep, not as attractive, or several hundred dollars. I ordered this on a Sunday afternoon and received it on Thursday. It was very easy to put together and I am very pleased with the quality of the material. The doors slide very easily. We were able to place old-fashioned glasses three deep on the top shelf without any problems. This item is 13\" deep, so it still leaves plenty of room to get by in our butler hallway. Once we started putting bar ware in it, my wife and I agreed that we would get a second one to stack on top. I ordered the second one that Sunday and again it arrived on Thursday. Stacking them was easy - it is a little difficult screwing the screws through the tops of the bottom one into the bottom of the top one, but I was able to get it done fairly quickly. I feel it would have been fine without securing them together unless you really ran into it with some force or if a child were to try to climb it. It's a great looking cabinet and ended up costing us under $190 for the two items rather than spending well over $500 for something that would not fit as nicely or look as good.So glad we chose this item and would buy again and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy, attractive cabinet. I like the finish on it. The instructions were clear. They even included a few extra screws in case you lost one, which I did. I would have preferred pilot holes for the screws in the back, but the screws that went into the more finished sides had holes. I did have some problems getting the top of the doors to retract because I put the front door in first, but aside from that the doors were easy to install. Just make sure you hit the right track. They roll very smoothly. One of my doors has a scratch on it, so I put it in the back to hide it. Not something I am going to bother returning, though. If I couldn't hide it, I would have asked for a replacement.I bought it to be a TV stand and unfortunately my DVD player is older and larger and it is too narrow for me to fit the DVD player inside and use the doors, so I had to put it on top. That was my error for not measuring better and taking into account the cables that come out the back of the DVD player and that inch or two they need spare. If you have a smaller BluRay or DVD player or other gaming console, you'd probably be fine. I plan to put a 32\" TV on top and I think it will be sturdy enough for that. In the meantime, I put my DVDs inside. The shelf is adjustable and you could buy another shelf/supports to add more storage. Overall a nice cabinet.I did not have a drill, but I did have a ratcheting screwdriver. You will want something like that because the back in particular has a LOT of screws and it will hurt your hand after a while. A manual screwdriver will be more difficult/painful.I was able to put this together by myself in about an hour or so. Easier than IKEA and better quality.",

But I was surprised at how little space once I started putting stuff in . my things only fit one way \u2026cause when the door opens it will hit them if put the other way , yes I read dimensions and measured but didn\u2019t think about doors needing to slide open to other side . my fault I guess lol I still give 5 stars .

The product was packaged well so I assume this is a quality control issue. One of each roller, on each door, was broken and wouldn't go up, so it wouldn't even fit to stay on let alone slide. As another review mentioned about holes lining up, this was also the case with mine. One piece had no marks at all where to drill about 26 small screws to hold the back panel on. Thinner panels within the door panel are extremely thin and move. I ordered this for extra kitchen storage but it isn't wide enough for any of my pan holder or lid holder, a crock pot or kitchen aid, are too wide no matter what angle you put them in. You get maybe 10 inches of useable space on the shelf once the doors are closed, so the descriptions are very deceiving. It's so very wobbly I put my coffee pot on it and ended up moving it off because I was scared the pot would fall and break. This is currently in the basement, trying to figure out weather it's worth the extra work it to return it. Ugh so disappointed because I wanted to love it and so badly need the extra storage space.",

Got this cabinet and I have 4 dozen plus jars stored in it and there is still room for more.Pretty good cabinet for the price. Definitely sturdy and well made. It arrived quickly and very well packaged with lots of styrofoam and protective sheets. The instructions are good. It recommends at least 2 people to put together, but I'm a senior woman and put it together on my own just fine.One thing I really liked was the backing. I've put together a lot of furniture and the backing is usually thin, flimsy and tends towards warping, and is attached with tiny nails often without a mark to know where to put it in so it gets into the wood behind. The backing on this is thicker and sturdy. There are pilot holes and it uses small screws. There is a raised edge on 3 sides and it sits right in there as if framed, making it very easy to line up and have it straight. Once in it's very solid.All the pieces fit together as expected. The doors are on rollers and they roll back and forth very smoothly. You do have to be careful when assembling because it is afterall that painted particle board material so it's very easy to chip/scratch. But once it's together it looks very nice. The sides are open with slats so you can see what's inside. If that's a bother you could always insert something on the inside like opaque plastic or something to close it. I find it okay as it's just for storing mason jars of produce. Will fit 3 rows of pints or 2 rows of quart jars. A shelf in the middle gives you two layers to store with 2 height options for placing that shelf. Very pleased with it overall.",

The screw holes on one side of one of the boards were the opposite way! Seeing as it was only one side that was wrong, there was nothing I could do to make it work. Making new holes wasn\u2019t possible either or else I would have a big gaping hole that was punched in incorrectly. Taking a closer look at it, I can see a lot of imperfections and chips. I would have been able to look passed that and touched it up myself if I could actually build the thing. Now after lugging it all the way up to my condo, I have to lug it all the way back to return it.
