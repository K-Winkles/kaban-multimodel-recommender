(Not a coffee bar) it is really nice looking and seems sturdy for being made from pressed board, the only disappointment is the back has a piece of white tape holding the 2 pieces together. That could have been made to look a lot better! Over all I really like it and would not only buy again but I would recommend this product.",

Other than that it\u2019s pretty stable and looks like the picture.Also would like to mention that the first one that was shipped was a disaster. The box had a huge piece cut out (clearly opened before) and they taped a random piece of cardboard on it to close it. Once I opened it all the pieces were smashed and damaged.

It went together very nice and directions were just fine. We added a stick up light under the shelf and it works perfect to organize and fine our movies.",

The pieces were made in bulk you can tell the holes didn\u2019t line up so we had to drill new ones. The screws didn\u2019t match and were missing some. The whole assembly was a mess.
