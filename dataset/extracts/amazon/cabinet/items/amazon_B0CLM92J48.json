I didn't hear him complain too much.It isn't the highest quality but it works. I'm not sure if the value is there for how much it costs though.",

I bought these and it changed my room completely, they were so easy to build. The first one i built with a friend took about 1.5 hours. The next day i built my second one alone. They are sturdy, beautiful and deep shelves. I was so close to spending 2000$ or more on custom made built ins. So happy i found these. Looking to buy two more soon.",
