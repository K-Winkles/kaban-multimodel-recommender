                "reviewText": "So the reason for the four star is because it didn't come with instructions to install it. I straight had to wind it and it took a lot longer than if I had a diagram or something. Basically I looked at the picture on Amazon to figure out where pieces went.It did come with extra screws which is nice if you know where you are putting them.All in all it was easy enough to build...from the bottom up is how I did it. Not saying all packages will come without instructions just saying mine didn't.It is a bit smaller than I thought but thats what you get when not looking at the dimensions before buying...my bad so it doesn't effect the review at all.It is Hella sturdy though...not like those Walmart cheap bookshelves. This one I could do a balancing act with my husband on top and I know it would hold.The drawers are your basic fabric and look kinda cheap but when they are in it doesn't look bad. I may paint them with fabric paint later to make them black instead of the weird brown shade they are.For the most part I am happy and would buy this again. Everything was nicely wrapped so it wouldn't get scratches are damaged in the shipping.I am not sure if the price is worth it since I'm a cheap person, however I didn't break the bank to horrible for the piece.",

Pictures are very deceiving. Even the ones other people took this self looked a LOT bigger. My 5 year old is taller then this thing so wasn\u2019t to impressed with that and the cubbies are very small I was at least expecting regular size cubes. But they are the really small ones. The Assembly was fast with a screw gun. Wasn\u2019t really looking for this small of a shelf but I have it and I guess I\u2019ll make it work somewhere just not where or what I needed it for. Lesson learned, Don\u2019t go off pictures",
