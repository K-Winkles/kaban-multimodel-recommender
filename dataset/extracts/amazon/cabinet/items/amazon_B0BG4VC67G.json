It is very unstable and for the money you spend it is not worth it. The max I would pay is $60\u2026. I went to use it for bathroom storage and as soon as I put about 15 items (bath soaps, hand soaps, etc) it wobbled side to side. It is extremely difficult to put together, but to take it apart and return it is a breeze. IKEA offers better quality storage cabinets for way cheaper fyi\u2026..",

It looks quite cheap next to my other unit, but all the time it took to put this together, I'm not sending it back. Screw it. It's also not very simple if you're doing it yourself.Buy at your own risk.",
