Using this high quality material makes the grill both sturdy and highly resistant to rust and corrosion. Includes a full size removable grease tray for easy cleaning. Dual Lined, Single Piece Hood The hood on the Bull Grill is a dual lined single piece construction that eliminates weld spots which could potentially cause rust, helps insulate the grill to keep the heat tapped in, and keeps the grill looking great by protecting it against heat discoloration which is achieved by keeping the external surface away from exposure to direct heat ensures the grill will stay beautiful for years. Solid Stainless Steel Grates The Bull cooking grates are solid 304 stainless steel all the way through. Solid 304 stainless steel construction, as opposed to hollow, transfers heat better for more consistent cooking and will last a lifetime and are guaranteed for life. Piezo Igniters On Every Burner Piezo Igniters are simple, independent ignition systems that are designed with the least amount of wiring to directly ignite each burner. Each Piezo Igniter is protected by a stainless steel housing so food drippings do not interfere with the spark igniting the gas from the burner.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely the best grill I've ever purchased, and I'm comparing this to Napoleon and Vermont Castings Grills, which are also terrific! Great design, construction, materials and other elements such as Piezo igniters for each burner. But I have one suggestion.... I found it difficult and expensive to obtain the grease tray liners. However, for the Steer Cart model a 16 x 16 x 1 inch Sicilian Pizza Pan fit perfectly and makes clean up a snap! Hope this adds to your enjoyment....",
