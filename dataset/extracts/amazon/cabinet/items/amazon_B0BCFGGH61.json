I don\u2019t know why it took me so long because this piece was so affordable and it looks so cute in the bathroom. It took me about 2 hours to build alone but it was pretty easy. It\u2019s not as heavy as it looks but it\u2019s still good quality. It didn\u2019t have any missing parts, they actually send a few extra screws just in case AND as a bonus, it comes with a screwdriver. Plenty of storage, and the shelves of different heights help accommodate all the bathroom amenities.",

                "reviewText": "I never write reviews but I thought I should make an exception for this - I was worried about putting this together because I\u2019m a not mechanically inclined and I read that some people had trouble. I really agonized over whether I should get it, especially since the shipping was twenty bucks. But I\u2019m happy to say, it\u2019s totally worth the price, even with the shipping. I just laid everything out, identified all the pieces and little packets of hardware, which were labeled (sometimes I had to look a bit to find the little sticker) and followed the directions. It was a little tricky in some places so you really HAVE look at the directions closely. If you do that, it comes together relatively easily. I didn\u2019t have any trouble with holes not lining up. I only made one mistake by putting one of the shelves upside down so you can see the little screws but I didn\u2019t bother to fix it because I would have had to take it all apart again. You can\u2019t see it unless there is nothing on the shelf and the door is open anyway. I did it ALL BY MYSELF except for having my 78 year old mother hold the doors so I could screw in the hinges. It took me about 3 hours- a far cry from the 30 minutes for 2 people it said, and my hand hurt from all the screwing, but I was very proud of myself and happy with the product. It is quite sturdy. And once I secured it to the wall, it wasn\u2019t tippy at all. It has made a huge improvement in the look of my bathroom.As far as smell- if you have chemical sensitivities, you should probably give this and other furniture like this a pass. It does have an odor that isn\u2019t pleasant but it\u2019s not super strong to me and I expect it will fade with time.The one thing that I don\u2019t love is the drawer, which doesn\u2019t pull out too far, making it a bit difficult to reach into the back but that is a minor concern.",
