                "reviewText": "The price for these cabinets was right. They were among the cheapest on Amazon for this size and needing multiple cabinets I took the plunge and hoped for the best.... and it paid off. The packaging was incredible to the point that I was shocked at how well protected the contents were.The instructions weren't the best, but I've certainly had worse ones from Ikea (and many others). You can get the general idea of what you're supposed to do with them.Assembly was easy. It took about 40 minutes to put together the first one as I was going back and forth with the instructions and finding the panels and parts needed. The second one probably took about 30 minutes since I had a better idea of everything.Once everything was together I couldn't have been happier with the purchase. The exterior looks great. Inside allows for all kinds of storage and shelving (which is adjustable to your liking).I will almost certainly buy at least two more of these in the next few months as I attempt to get more organized.",

                "reviewText": "This cabinet is made of aluminum and has four adjustable shelves. It does require assembly, which isn't too difficult but is easier with two people. It is black in color and available in a variety of sizes. I don't have a garage, but I do have a container that I use for storage of everything from tools to Christmas decorations. I wanted a method to organize it a bit, so I acquired this cabinet to help. I like that it can be locked, which allows me to keep others out if I wish to hide Christmas gifts in it.This shelf is composed of cold rolled steel and is reinforced, making it sturdy and long lasting. It also had a layer of protection that increased its service life. The shelves can handle up to 150 pounds each, but nothing I'm putting on them comes close to that. I got this one for small hand tools, screws, bolts, nuts, and things of that nature.The cabinet is not difficult to assemble, but I must admit that the directions are a little confusing and caused me to install pieces backwards a few times, forcing me to redo my work. It takes some time to put together, but it is well worth it because this is a well-made, high-quality shelf and cabinet that works perfectly for my purposes.",

                "reviewText": "So this product was advertised as metal storage units for garage however they are very versatile and can be used in the home, and look beautiful. I do a lot of cooking so I got these to place my culinary items for organization and easy access. I was very surprised how much fit into these storage units which makes me very impressed. The installation from beginning to end for one person took me about 1.5 hours. Great quality storage unit. The value for my money is worth the purchase. The only issue I can come up with is the locking mechanism as you have to push the door that has the lock in a little in order for it to latch. I also wish it was one key for entire unit but each lock top and bottom has its own key so don\u2019t lose them. However that is not a deal breaker and I plan on ordering me 2 more. You also need to be careful not to ding or dent them as I had a door that wouldn\u2019t go in like the others and it slipped and dinged my bottom door but that was on me.",
