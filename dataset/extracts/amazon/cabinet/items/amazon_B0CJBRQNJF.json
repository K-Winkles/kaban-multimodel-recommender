                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this cabinet for a span of six days, and I must admit my excitement upon its delivery. My spouse shares in my enthusiasm for this new addition to our home.As has been previously noted by others, the assembly instructions are straightforward to follow. Given my proficiency in assembly, my wife and I managed to put it together in a mere 35 minutes. However, for those lacking assembly experience, the process might be a bit more time-consuming. Nevertheless, it's worth mentioning that the cabinet boasts a simple structure, making it suitable for beginners as well.The storage capacity of this cabinet is truly impressive, and it is entirely devoid of any unpleasant odors, which we find quite pleasing.It's important to mention that the protective film on the acrylic glass panel requires removal. Initially, we overlooked the fact that one of the acrylic glass panels had a protective film that was tightly affixed, resulting in a mismatched color with the other three panels after assembly. Fortunately, I contacted a customer service representative who promptly and effectively assisted us in investigating and resolving this issue, for which we commend their excellent service.This cabinet is undeniably beautiful, and we are already considering purchasing more for our kitchen and bathroom.",

That said it's very attractive, and the doors you have to really get up on it too realize their metal because they look like furniture, especially with the handles. I needed a storage cabinet for my finished basement and this was perfect. Very solid and can hold heavy things. It's about 5 feet tall. I would buy again.",
