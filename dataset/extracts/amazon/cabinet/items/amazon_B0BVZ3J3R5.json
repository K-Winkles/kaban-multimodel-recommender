                "reviewText": "Its decent but took a while to put together. Its all composite wood so screwing in all parts can be challenging if you dont get it right the first time. Even after tightening all parts,it still wobbles.They delivered VERY late and seller never contacted to give any update on the delay.Despite all this, the handles are missing and seller didnt respond to missing part request so far.Only reason im not returning is because i cant carry it again to the center. Packaging wasn't great and will take two people to lift it.Hold upto size 11 decently.",

Such a chic way to hide your shoes but also keep things nice and tidy. I put this together by myself in about an hour. Directions were clear and straight forward. It\u2019s sturdy and functional. Definitely recommend for anyone with a smaller space.",

Also, it\u2019s hard to use. The drawer latch to keep the doors close works too well and makes the drawers difficult to open. Lastly, be ready to nail the whole thing to the wall, because it will fall if you don\u2019t",
