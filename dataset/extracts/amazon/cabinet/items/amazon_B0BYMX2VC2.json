The material is a mixture of plastic and paper and is very brittle. The door snapped in half during the assembly of the product. Once assembled it looks terrible on the sides as it is SXmade with puzzle pieces that snap together. The puzzle pieces show on the sides so it looks very cheap and unattractive. Skip this product and pay a little extra for something made that is more durable. It looks like a craft project and not as nice as the photos show.I recommend skipping this product for something that will last more than a few months or in my case didn't last assebly.",

But- it is cheaply made, not sturdy, breakable. I do like the size, it is what I wanted, but instead a better quality item. I wouldn't recommend for value but I would for it fitting the description.",
