Our master bedroom is very small so we needed something narrow to go under our tv and also create some additional storage.1. Putting it together: I really recommend two people, a drill and a hammer. It was pretty easy to put together with those 3 things. I felt like the pieces were nice. No cardboard surprises! :)2. Holds about 6 medium sized pair of shoes on one side! So roughly 12 all together!3. I wish the brackets to the wall were black! We broke the rules and flipped them around when mounting it so the metal didn\u2019t stick out more than it needs too. I recommend this! I plan to paint the brackets to conceal them.Overall, great little cabinet. I would recommend this to a friend.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe cabinet took me and my boyfriend around an hour to assemble. It's not difficult, but it is important to follow the directions carefully. While it is made of fiberboard or particle board, it feels sturdy and well-made. The finish is very nice and doesn't look \"fake\" or feel like it will scratch easily. Overall, for the money, this is a nice piece of storage furniture. Its slim design holds a lot of shoes and doesn't take up too much space.",
