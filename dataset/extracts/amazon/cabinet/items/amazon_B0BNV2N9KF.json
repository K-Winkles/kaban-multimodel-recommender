                "reviewText": "First off, in constructing this cabinet you'd likely need a power tool. I've put together a lot of pre-fabricated furniture, and built some other pieces for my living space. The holes in the cabinet are pre-made, but they're not pre-drilled, so it'd take some effort to assemble this by hand.Upon putting it together I realized I was missing two pieces- the parts of the cabinet door that allowed for it to close magnetically. Apparently I moved too quickly when putting the cabinet together, as I expected to find the piece when taking all of the other screws/fasteners out of their packaging. The missing pieces were labeled in a package with other pieces.As for quality of material, I found that the bottom of the drawer and the backing of this piece of furniture is such thin plywood its just a few degrees off from being classified as card stock. Literally the cardboard box this came in has more integrity than those two pieces.The last straw was when I finished, put it in the bathroom, then went to wipe it off with some pretty diluted vinegar before putting anything in it. The paint came off when I wiped it. Now there's faded streaks on it from where the paint came off. So much for this thing being suited for a bathroom?? I know this isn't a top-tier cabinet, but do I have to worry about paint coming off onto my belongings?Looks like I have to disassemble and just get a refund. This thing is awful, I'd be suspicious of all the reviews that repeating how \"sturdy\" this thing is",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a temporary solution for a cabinet and I found it. The box arrived on time and in good condition. After following the directions, the unit was a little wobbly, but I got what I paid for. I ordered the white cabinet and found the color to be just as advertised. It looks nice and is functional. The inside of the cabinet is a little smaller than I anticipated, but it'll work until I find a more permanent piece of real furniture. Overall, it was a good purchase for the cost.",
