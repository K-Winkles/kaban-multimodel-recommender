There is a slight misalignment of the doors but it is only aesthetic and does not affect the functionality at all.",

Took me about an hour. With the LED light strips, and the color of the wood veneer (I ordered the dark brown), once it's assembled, this piece looks fantastic. You could hardly tell it wasn't purchased in a high-end furniture store. It's so roomy, too. It holds all of my various and sundry wine glasses AND alcohol in the underneath cabinet and it's fun to display your pretty unopened wine bottles in the top wine storage. Then, how cool is it to have a multi-color LED light with remote to play with, too?! I really like this piece. One of my favorite Amazon purchases from this past year.",

Assembly took about 45ish minutes, which isn\u2019t that bad! Instructions mostly make sense and the pieces are mostly clear as to where they go.My cat kept climbing on my liquor bottles, so I purchased this to keep him off of the expensive stuff ;)Would buy again!",
