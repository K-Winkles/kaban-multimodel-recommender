                "reviewText": "I live in a 400sq foot tiny home. I made a lot of changes to my lifestyle in order to do this. But there was one thing in particular that I would not compromise on. I wasn't going to give up quilting. Storage in my home is a luxury. I needed somewhere for my machines, tools and fabrics. I looked at a lot of cabinets before I settled on this one. I am really happy with my cabinet and will be adding another one soon to hold my crochet supplies. This cabinet arrived in a very sturdy box. Inside the box there were double reinforced metal corners with Styrofoam padding to protect the cabinet pieces. I'm going to upcycle this into some bird houses. There were layers of foam wrapping and sheets of Styrofoam between all the pieces. I only found one bent spot that split the coating. It's shown in my pics. It was an inside spot so not a deal breaker. The only other glitch I found was one of the neodymium magnets was cracked. Again a minor detail and not a deal breaker. I assembled the cabinet by myself in just over an hour and a half. When I got to the back panels where I needed an extra set of hands I just used masking tape to be those hands for me. All the screw holes matched up well enough. The shelves are lightweight but sturdy. Fabric weighs a ton so I needed shelves that would stand up to the abuse. I really like the corner protectors as they really added to the sturdiness and I won't be stubbing my toes on sharp metal. The doors hung easily and are inline. The wheels are great and roll very smoothly. The lock functions well and it's nice to have handles on both doors. The white finish on the cabinet is smooth and looks so clean. Now they don't make furniture like they did back in my day anymore. So I take extra precautions when assembling things like this cabinet. For this I used Vibra-tite blue threadlocker in gel form on all the screws. I've used this product on a lot of my projects and it has served me well. You can buy it here on Amazon in a pump bottle. It's great stuff and will make my cabinet last a long time. You only need simple hand tools to remove the bolt or screw you put it on. The one con with this cabinet is really just a personal preference thing. The screwdriver they include is too small unless you have tiny hands. That thing belongs in Munchkin Land. So to sum this up... I'm an old woman with a really bad back. I got this put together with no trouble. The instructions are well diagramed and easy to understand. I can't wait to get the second cabinet. This is a great product and I'm extremely happy with the purchase.",

Some of the parts were bent despite really excellent packaging. But it still went together ok.The company should improve on the yellowish plastic parts on the white cabinet. They really make the cabinet look a lot worse than it needs to look. Metal corner pieces and some kind of decent handle would be a huge improvement.I\u2019m happy enough with the cabinet. I might spray paint the yellowed plastic parts.",

This definitely takes two people to assemble, in my opinion, so I would plan for that ahead of time. Wheels make it easy to move around (even on carpet) and the locks work very well!",

These are super thin and bendy compared to the metal cabinets of yesteryear.They are convenient in that they roll around the garage and will store your items. To be fair, the shelves are reinforced just enough so that I think they would take a little bit of weight as long as it's distributed, but definitely not a lot of weight in the middle. They say as much in the product description. I wouldn't push it. These are not heavy duty by any stretch of the imagination.I give them 3 stars because the finish was fine, they did not come significantly dented, and they are pretty much what the product description says they are. However, they are not nearly sturdy enough to justify the cost. If I had to do it over again, I'd either wait to get these for a significant deal, or spend a little more and get something sturdier.",

I quickly determined it was and ordered the second.Very solid cabinets. Easy to assemble! Extra pieces! Even tools! Rubber padding on the corners!Only minor negative is that the rubber padding also holds them together. Which means when you mount them to the wall they stick out a bit. And the metal is spaced a bit from the wall so the screws pull the metal to the wall. It might be better with a thinner option for the rear.Also, imo washers for the screws is a must to attach it firmly to a wall. In my trailer I might put some anchors up in to the ceiling just to be safe and reduce bouncing.",

I want millionaires to experience weightlessness as much as anyone but it cost sixty dollars more. Purchased the other one anyway. Very fast delivery arrived in great condition despite one box being horribly damaged...I think forklift drivers must be underpaid or just angry who knows.
