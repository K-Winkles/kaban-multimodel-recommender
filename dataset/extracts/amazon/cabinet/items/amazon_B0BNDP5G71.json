                "reviewText": "I\u2019d read a lot of reviews on lateral files. Either they are relatively cheap with complicated assembly or very expensive but pre-built. I took a gamble on this item, and have been pleasantly surprised. Came very well package, but it is a very heavy box. I assembled it without by myself, taking care to understand the instructions.Took me about 2hrs from unpacking to finish. One key to the assembly is when the drawers are placed on the rails, you do have to push down on each side to click/lock them in place. Final product is excellent, robust and much better than I expected. One nice benefit is that if you\u2019re storing letter files, you can arrange them left to right, and use the full width of the drawer with no gaps. This allows for many more files and no loss of space than arranging them front to back. Of course its early days and we will see how this holds up with use, but for now, very happy.",

The color is more of a grey white than pure white. Assembly was a bit involved. I may order the other model. I wish it came with both left and right side 2 drawer options. Unfortunately the locking mechanism inside broke after a week, which is why I\u2019m taking off a star.",

All good quality and arrived with no shipping damage.Pros:Plenty of space with easy access for my hobby supplies.Cons:Had great hopes for the peg board sides, but the holes are square and require a special peg. It came with a couple but extras or different sizes are expensive in the range of $7 each peg/hook. Not a deal breaker as the steel construction means magnetic accessories work just as well as their pegs.Haven't decided to put the doors on yet as once the go on they don't come off.",

                "reviewText": "Great manufacturer to deal with as they promptly return all calls & email inquiries.Assembled on my own and had to turn over against directions for easier screw hole access. That said, many holes are hard to navigate and sometimes too small for the screws especially the rear panel. My major complaint is that when inserting or taking out a Pentaflex file the space is not wide enough resulting in bending of the file-not a deal breaker. Had many types/styles of file cabinets over the years but this one has ease of access to files as the drawers open & shut rather well.",
