                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the pull-out trash can rack and it has completely exceeded my expectations! Here's why I'm giving it a solid 5-star review:Durable and Reliable:The rolling trash can slides are constructed with high-quality steel and boast a chrome-plated surface. The smooth rolling action not only adds a touch of sophistication but also ensures that hiding and recycling kitchen trash cans is a breeze. It's a game-changer in keeping my home consistently neat and clean.Adjustability:What sets this trash can holder apart is its incredible adjustability. With 4 adjustable lengths (11.89\", 12.60\", 13.50\", and 17.76\"), it effortlessly accommodates various trash can sizes. No need to worry about compatibility \u2013 it's designed to fit most trash cans seamlessly.Easy Installation:I appreciate products that make my life easier, and this one certainly does. No assembly required for the base \u2013 it comes pre-assembled, requiring only 4 screws to secure it in place. A hassle-free installation process that anyone can manage.Perfect Size:The size of the pull-out trash bin is just right for my kitchen. At 16.22\" L x 11.22\" W x 16.18\" H, it fits snugly into my cabinets. The minimum cabinet size requirements are reasonable, ensuring that it can accommodate 7-11 gallon trash cans without any issues.Clear Note:I appreciate the transparency in the product description.

                "reviewText": "This pull out trash can holder from Socont is reasonably well made. It has full extension glides and the glides do detach with the typical plastic finger ( pictured) you push up or down on each black finger and pull the whole drawer unit outward. The specs state that the cabinet needs to be 11 1/2 wide - I believe it could be slightly narrower possibly 11 3/8 \u201c The pull out can also be floor mounted meaning that if your cabinet was wider instead of using wood cleats and building out the sides you could simply screw it down to the floor of the cabinet. It also indicates it accommodates a trashcan I believe under 16 inches tall and I found that to be a bit of an understatement. It will hold a full-size tall trash can that we use at work. That trash can is 22 \u201c tall 11 1/4 \u201c wide and 15 5/8\u201d deep. This is a typical trash can that fits the normal tall kitchen trash bags. The second photo is a black trash can and it is slightly smaller than the measurements this pull out recommended. I really think it comes down to the height of the cabinet but typically if you\u2019re doing this under your countertop,\u2026it might even be worth taking this mechanism shopping for the trash can, along with a measuring tape to be sure you don\u2019t exceed your height limitation. Keeping in mind what might be above this like a drawer \u2026or cutting board pull out, and being sure to allow for the cabinet face frame.I think if I installed this under the sink, I would actually box it out and make a wood front to go in front of the forward frame, I don\u2019t think this would stand up to being pulled out by the frame itself repeatedly. Otherwise I think it will do a fine job riding along as you pull out your drawer or door front by the knob built into your cabinets.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Insanley easy to install and holds a variety of can sizes",
                "reviewText": "Very well made unit - very sturdy tracks frame. Installs with 4 screws - I mean how much easier can it get? The wire bars (very thick gauge but still springy) included are used to lock the can in place so it does not flop around and can be easily adjusted for 7 gallon to I am guessing maybe 13 gallon depending on the shape. I am not sure what that one review is talking about how it arrived dented (not possible unless it was run over with a truck as there is nothing to dent) or that it does not \"fit\" standard cabinets as it is not \"long enough\" they must have some really bizarre cabinets and delivery people. It fits fine with loads of room to spare in my junky old 1980's pressboard kitchen cabinet and I even have a quarter shelf on the back wall that stops me from using a larger trash can but the track itself has plenty of room to spare. The bars do a great job of locking the can down and you can easily reverse the front bar (it pops out if you squeeze it together and remove it from the track) if you want to install it with a very close (almost full contact) to the cabinet door and still hold the can in place. Highly recommended.",
