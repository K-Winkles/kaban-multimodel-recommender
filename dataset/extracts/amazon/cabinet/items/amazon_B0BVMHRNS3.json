The thicker, squared edge drawer it is a snug fit and works beautifully.However, on the tapered edge drawer, it is a nightmare. The interior is just too small to keep it on the drawer. I was able to bulk it up enough with tape to keep it in place.If you have squared edge. This is a great value item.If you have a tapered edge, this is not a good choice. The interior needs to be as low as the towel bar to stay on the drawer.",
