It came boxed really well with corner guard, a lot of foam blocks/spacers, and foam sheets to protect from scratching. Pretty well made and easy to put together. The modern knob was nice but the edges were too sharp, so I replaced it with a round and smooth knob. Really happy with the purchase. Definitely recommend purchasing.",
