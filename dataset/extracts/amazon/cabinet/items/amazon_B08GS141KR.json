More colors and designs would be great too. Worth the money for sure!",

                "reviewText": "I'm stuck between horrible to assemble (1 star) , and liking the finished product (4 stars), so it get's 3.Assembly:- Comes with extra pieces, because you'll need them when the connectors break (several of them). Inevitably it will be on a lower level than the one you're working on, or in the middle and a pain in the butt to replace the broken connector and get it to \"snap in,\" so expect some re-work and frustration. When I say broken I mean just that, the plastic is brittle and will literally snap and fly off.- You will soon come to the realization that you will never get all of the corners or sides of every connector snapped in, so you get as many as possible (still sturdy enough). Be advised this is not engineered to exacting tolerances.Once you get it together:Fits a lot of shoes, and I like that the front covers close (can fit 2 pairs in each cubicle if your shoe size is small-medium (up to mens 9 1/2-10 size). If you have big feet expect only one pair to fit per cubicle The closing \"flip up\" covers make the garage look cleaner than just having a bunch of open show racks.End of the day, pain in the butt to put together (think tinker toy but with connectors that break), but the conundrums that I like the finished product and the price is reasonable Hopefully no one will ever walk into this (not sturdy), cuz I'll cry and be looking for where I put those extra connectors, but it does the job of un-clustering my garage.",

                "reviewText": "I never think I have as many shoes as I actually do until I reorganize my closet- and that's when I started looking for shoe storage that wouldn't also take up my entire closet. I love this organizer because it's sturdy, but also easy to move, and I can adjust it to fit my shoe storage needs. It does come with the covers for the sections, but I decided to leave them off when I assembled mine because my closet already has a door so I didn't need the extra coverage- but if I were to move it and put it by my front door then I would put the covers back on. I also split the organizer in half so that it wasn't as tall, and that ended up creating one of the sections to be a little taller than the others, which was perfect for my taller boots! If I decided to change my mind and wanted to make it taller, I could easily stack both halves. I'm thinking about getting another one so I can make room for even more shoes haha",

None of the assembly videos show them being used. I also couldnt get the hooks on, but i dont intend to use them so i didnt try too hard. Its a little rickety for my crooked old house, but its made of inexpensive materials and pretty much snaps together. It isnt entirely what i wanted for its purpose, but for something more solid id have to pay over $100.. u def get what u pay for... it would be good for a closet shoe storage (or even a shelving unit) instead of a decorative shoe hider that i had intended.. it is slightly bigger than the specs due to the pieces sticking out. I also dont care for how those mentioned pieces look sticking out as well as the shelf clips. Hopefully it at least will keep the kittens from fighting with my shoes and holds up to my boyfriends heavy work boots",
