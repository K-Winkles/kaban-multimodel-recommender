No way you can just use a screw driver. But beware, adjust your settings on your drill or you'll strip or break the boards. I only felt like giving up a few times. Luckily I was able to get it together. Surprisingly, it's very sturdy and has a cute farmhouse look to it. It works for the space i need it for. Using as a linen cabinet and has a lot of room to fill. Overall, really happy with my purchase considering the price point.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First, I specifically ordered this cabinet because of the size. I have a very narrow area in my bathroom I wanted to use this for with a 16\" wide opening. Based on the picture, the dimension across the front would be 15.2\" wide and the top supposedly has a piece with an overhang that makes it 18.2\". THIS IS NOT CORRECT. The actual measurement across the front is 17\" wide. It also does not show that there is a slight lip on the front panel that makes it wider than the back of the cabinet.Second, this is an extremely cheap piece of furniture. I knew it wasn't going to be the greatest quality based on the price and the description but but it's flake board and basically pressed cardboard. It really wasn't even worth the amount I paid for it. The pieces don't align well once it's put together and the magnets to hold the door shut do not line up with the metal part on the door. It wobbles and none of the screws get tight enough to keep it from wobbling - not to mention I would never want to tighten them too much because I would be afraid the pieces would split.Third, there is an imperfection right on the front.And last but not least, it took entirely too long to assemble. I'm not Bob the Builder but I'm also not inept. This should not have taken almost 2 hours to put together. The directions weren't great and some of the pictures were backwards.",
