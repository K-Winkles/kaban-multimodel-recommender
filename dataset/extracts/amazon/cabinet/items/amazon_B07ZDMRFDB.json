I have a small 7 x 6 full bathroom that lacked storage and this is a winner. It is taller and deeper than any other unit I\u2019ve seen. I am no carpenter and I have old wall so hanging it wasn\u2019t easy for me and it is heavy so have help. I had a problem getting the.screws for the very bottom to stay so I used construction adhesive. I\u2019ve had it for two years now I think. Was my first attempt at hanging cabinets and doors but the end redo were worth it.",

Dowels are so loose they need to be glued, two cams bent, (fortunately two extra were supplied). Using the predrilled holes for assembly resulted in uneven alignment of the door in it's opening. The quality of the paint work was not good, see pictures. Overall, the hamper looks decent and will do what's is advertised to do, but for the price and the assembly issues I would not purchase this again.",

After taking a closer look I found an old used ziplock bag with random screws and hardware, the box which was supposed to have the hardware and screws organized was open and tampered with. It seems I got a return of someone who tried to put it together but wasn't happy with the purchase! So disappointed.",
