I have decent cabinet space for day to day but needed a little more that scaled well in my space and allowed me to start stashing more non perishables. This measured perfectly and satisfied my need for too much color!Now, the instructions really do suck (people aren\u2019t kidding), and good luck finding a useful YouTube video to help. The instructions are sequentially awkward and if you\u2019re like me and a slightly below average DIY talent then you\u2019ll need to 1. Move even slower than you usually do. Yes you\u2019ll hate it but it helps. 2. Look up the instructions on their website so you can zoom in SUPERCLOSE. I don\u2019t have vision issues but I needed this.There are tons of random extra holes in this thing and you\u2019ll want to just jam things into them. DON\u2019T. This might be fun initially but will prove extra frustrating later when you actually need the things.It took me like 2 hours. I still had an issue getting perfect alignment on one of the doors (as you can see) but it\u2019s fine. One of the other reviewers recommended different hardware which I also scooped up and loved. It adds a little sparkle which I appreciate.I love this thing - great price, super useful and pretty cute! Buy it. And if you\u2019re good at giving instruction please create a decent YouTube video without terrible smooth jazz elevator doodley -do music. Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "We got this to use as a shoe cabinet for our front hall.It's a great size, very attractive, easy to clean, easy to open and close with the magnetic doors, and seems stable.It took me about 10 hours to assemble. I love assembling stuff so I wasn't turned away by reviews saying it's hard to assemble. I'm not the fastest, I take my time. Most of the holes seemed too small for the screws, but a lot of them could be forced through with enough elbow grease and a regular philips screwdriver. One or two holes I had to use an electric drill to open up a bit more.The included magnets didn't seem to work for the doors, so I bought some stronger magnets at Lowe's for about $5 and they work fine. My cats haven't gotten into the cabinet yet.I debated about whether I wanted to use the wall anchors and decided not to. It doesn't seem to need them since it's against a wall and I didn't want to mark up my wall.It does look a little stark in white. I might put some stickers or hang something decorative above it.It's a bit of a project but it's the perfect size, looks good, and functions well!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two of the peach colored cabinets and love them. They had some of the best packaging I have ever seen for furniture and arrived in perfect condition. While the assembly instructions could be a little clearer in places, it\u2019s pretty easy to assemble. I don\u2019t understand the reviews saying things didn\u2019t line up, that they needed to drill holes, etc., as everything fit together perfectly on both my cabinets. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that some of the ends of screw stick out a bit, and you are supposed to cover them with these little rubber caps so the sharp ends are covered. It works okay, but I think the caps will eventually fall off leaving the screws exposed. But overall I am very happy with these cabinets and think they look really pretty and will last a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cabinet because the exact matching items I purchased before are no longer available. It is (almost) identical to previously purchased ones from another vendor. I have put together a few of these style cabinets previously. I will admit with practice it does get easier. Illustrations are made to be somewhat universal (I think) between extremely similar products. That might add some confusion. Extra hardware is appreciated but does not help if you are not sure what you are doing. I think they are very well made, for what we are using them for (in our clinic/office). I was not a fan of the provided handles, so I found some different ones that would fit. It really made the cabinet look way better. See the attached photo of the handles I used to replace the originals... Cabinet is way better than the other 6 I bought before. YMMV. I will purchase more of this item and reccomend. If you are not good at putting this type of thing together, just get help. Take your time. Pay attention to the drawings. The screws would be useless if they were not tight. Do not drill new holes (if you think you need to, you put it together wrong). Back up or start over. Be prepared to flip it around, lay it down on carpet, to get a solid surface to get good leverage on the \"tight\" screws. It is a bit if a \"knuckle buster\" if you get in a hurry. Go slow. You can do this! I love mine.",
