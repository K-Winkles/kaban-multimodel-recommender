                "reviewText": "I've been looking for tilt drawer shoe storage for a while and have looked at options at IKEA and Wayfair as well trying to find the perfect one for what I needed. I needed one with less than 7 inches in depth, a reasonable amount of storage, a reasonable price, and the right wood tone. This one checked all of my boxes! The hardware is ugly silver plastic and I was looking for black to match the rest of my hardware but while the spacing of the screw holes is a standard size it's not the most common so there were less options available. I ended up just painting the plastic ones black and they look fine. The instructions were easy to follow and two of us put three of them together in an hour and a half. We did mount them flush to the wall but the drywall plugs included were garbage and we used other ones we had on hand. The materials do feel a bit cheap and are particle board but for $100 each that's what I expected. I think $70 is a more reasonable price, however I do think they will hold up great.",

It's extremely sturdy. And easier than using the wall brackets included with the set, we were able to open the top drawer, and drill the back of the piece directly into the wall, so that the top of the shelf was all level. The natural color goes well against just about any color scheme you have. It's roomy. I highly recommend this piece. Well worth the $$ I paid for it.",

I now have my shoes neatly organized near the door so I can easily grab a pair and kick myself in the ass for not ordering this sooner! Even Jesus Tap Dancing Christ would love shoe organizer to keep all of his tap shoes in place! It's narrow and fits snugly against the wall, so it's unobtrusive and not a bulky, obnoxious piece of furniture like the elephants you inherited from your grandmother. It was easy enough to put together, although it took this assembly-challenged woman a few more minutes than the directions suggested. TOTALLY worth it, though! This one has the wicker front. I'll probably get the plain white one for my bedroom. (I might even use it for more than shoes in there...)",
