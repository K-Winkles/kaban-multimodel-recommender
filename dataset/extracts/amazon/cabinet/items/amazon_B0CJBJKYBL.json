                "reviewText": "We had a big open space in our bathroom but needed more storage so bought this cabinet! It\u2019s great for the purpose we need it to. We use the top for every day things and the bottom for our stock storage of stuff.Super easy to put together. My husband put it together by himself in like an hour & a half. Very detailed instructions he said which was a plus.About the smell: I was hesitant to buy this product based on people\u2019s reviews saying it smelled terribly. It did have a strong smell, but the smell was like new furniture. I didn\u2019t think it was so terrible that it should give me a migraine like some people stated\u2026 has no one ever thought to clean the piece of Furniture to get rid of the smell? I wiped it down with Clorox wipes, scent lemon, and the smell was POOF! Gone! I didn\u2019t heavy hand rub to clean it or anything just lightly wiped it and the smell went away. Would recommend purchasing this.Height measurements: I took a picture to show how tall it was. People said the measurements were off. They were absolutely correct. You can see it comes up to mid shoulder. This worked for us because we didn\u2019t want something so tall.",

                "reviewText": "The day I bought this I was rushing because we had company coming and I wanted to finish my bathroom upgrade before they arrived. I used the product photo as a reference (dumb, I know) and quickly scanned for depth of the cabinet but didn't do the math on the actual height. *facepalm* The photo is SUPER (like 100%) misleading unless you're buying this cabinet for a child. If I were to hang a picture and a mirror in the same placement as shown in the photo they would be about chest high on the wall in reality. This cabinet is only 4' tall. Yep. I know....it says it right there in the title: 50 some odd inches tall. No one to blame but myself. Let me be your cautionary tale kids, ALWAYS read the description, take time to do the math. I was so incredibly disappointed but had to laugh at the same time. Aside from that, the cabinet is actually cute. Fairly easy to assemble and despite its diminutive size, it serves the area well.",

                "reviewText": "to put outside our tiny bathroom. We desperately needed more storage and had a shallow space outside our bathroom door that was perfect for this cabinet. It was easy to assemble; I used a drill but made sure the clutch was set appropriately so I wouldn\u2019t drive the screws all the way through the chip-board. (That is so easy to do so be extra careful if you use a drill for assembly!). The instructions were clear and easy to follow and there were a couple extra pieces of hardware, just in case. This cabinet is beautiful and sturdy enough for what I\u2019m using it for. Don\u2019t expect it to be as sturdy as real wood or drag it across the floor fully loaded, you get what you pay for and you\u2019ll damage it. This was a great addition to our house and with a plant on top it fills the space we have for it very nicely.",

                "reviewText": "Let's be honest, this isn't an heirloom quality piece of furniture. It's composed of the same materials that all modern furniture at this price point are composed of. It's functional, packaged well for shipping, and incredibly easy to assemble. An already assembled piece at a local furniture store was on sale for about $600 before shipping and taxes.The labeling of each piece and bag of screws is spot on. Take your time and follow the directions.Tips to make this solid if you're sure you are about to connect the correct pieces1) use glue (I used Elmer's) for the dowels, screws cams, and back board.2) use a level. The doors will line up perfectly if the cabinet is level. If it's off a little bit, your doors will reflect that3) LEAVE IT ALONE AND LET THE GLUE DRY ONCE YOU'VE LEVELED ITThe glue makes all the difference in adding strength and structure.I upgraded the handles and it looks even better.Happy with the outcome. I would recommend it.",
