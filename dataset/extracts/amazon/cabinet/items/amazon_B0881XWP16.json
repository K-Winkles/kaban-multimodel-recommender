Why a company would put stickers on the outside of a cabinet is crazy. After fighting with these very well stuck stickers it was pretty easy to assemble. It\u2019s sturdy and nicely made. So unless they made a mistake on placement of the stickers be prepared to give it some much needed work to remove them before assembly.",

I didn't measure the dimensions of the product description beforehand... but knew it would fit the bill even if a bit smaller. Turned out to be a great size. I could store spray dusters, Krylon art spray cans, WD40, and a plethora of other things. There is sufficient vertical space inside to put cans on the bottom or the shelf, or both. Advice: Hand-screw the screws in with a screwdriver. I started off by trying to use a power drill with screwdriver attachment and stripped the hole and/or screwhead a little. (Can't remember which.) It's decent quality, but not quality enough to use power tools for assembly, in my opinion",
