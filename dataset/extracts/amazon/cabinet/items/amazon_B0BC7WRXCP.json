It took 2 people a little less than an hour to put together, and it was not difficult at all because the directions were clear. There were a lot of extra parts including a replacement magnet for the doors, which was a nice touch. I was happy to see the shelf heights were adjustable since I have some odd sized bottles. Highly recommend!",

The only part of putting it together was the first screws for the magnetic closers. The holes weren't drilled out all the way. I just put the screws in without the brackets to make the hole. Other than that it was pretty straightforward. It has plenty of space and seems pretty sturdy. It's a perfect size and I have room for more items too. There wasn't any damage and all the parts were there. They even gave me a bag of extra parts. It came with some small tools (Allen wrench, philips screwdriver and flathead) but I used my own. I'd call this an excellent purchase. I'm so happy!",
