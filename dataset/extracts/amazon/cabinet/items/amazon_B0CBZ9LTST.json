This cabinet brought my room to a whole new level. Take note my husbands size 11 did not fit unless you lay them down which means you have less storage in that bin. My size 8 I can fit 4 pairs standing up across. 5 or6 if it\u2019s fit flops or flat sanders as you can stack! As for my husbands shoes I had to go with under the bed storage. Amazon has a nice selection. What I chose for him was delivered yesterday. Stay tuned!!",

This shoe cabinet is exactly what we needed. It holds lots of shoes (not boots though) and now our entryway is neat and uncluttered. The dual layers inside each drawer, let you store the shoes in pairs. The style fits right into our decor. It wasn't difficult to assemble, yet not simple either. You just have to pay attention to which piece connects to the next one(s).The only thing which you might want to pay attention to is that they recommend screwing it into the wall.",

                "reviewText": "Super stoked when we purchased this it did in fact help clean up our front door shoe section however we had multiple complaints from the moment of assembly first off being storage space you can barely fit shoes that aren\u2019t like the ones featured in the photo (ie my toms fit perfectly my running shoes didn\u2019t). Second the design quality is cheap which led to the shoe compartments to breaking with a few weeks of assembly so clearly wasn\u2019t designed for long term use. If we had paid like less for it I may have excused it but I feel like for the price the compartments and it\u2019s attachments should be much sturdier maybe made of metal instead of plastic so that they don\u2019t break. Overall concept is great just would recommend a different/more sturdy brand.",
