                "reviewText": "I searched for hours trying to find the perfect pantry to put in my laundry room because I needed extra storage space in my kitchen. So many products have mixed reviews it makes buying anything online stressful! I went with this pantry because it was the exact size I needed and I love the look of it. It's perfect! I don't understand the bad reviews! First, it comes in two boxes and is very well packaged. I had one small scratch on one of the pieces but it's not a piece that is seen once put together so it wasn't a big deal to me. Second, I am a 34 year old female and I put this thing together by myself! It took me about 3 hours with breaks in between. I saw some people having trouble putting on the doors but I didn't have any trouble at all. Just follow the instructions. One piece of advice I can give is to take the screws you use to put the door on and screw it into the door a little before you actually try to put the door on the pantry. This makes putting screws in once it's in place a lot easier. The instructions are just pictures but they are super easy to follow. I laid all my pieces out in my living room floor before beginning so it was easy to see all the parts. I suggest putting the cabinet together where you intend to put it because it is heavy to move once assembled. I am VERY happy with this pantry and highly suggest it! It's a super nice piece of furniture and it holds a lot! I cleaned out several cabinets from my kitchen and still have plenty of room for more. Just buy it! You'll be glad you did!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great cabinet. Took me about 1.5 hours to put together because there was an ungodly amount of pieces. But everything was very clearly labelled which was great! No guessing! One step in the assembly made no sense. When you assemble the top cabinet, it wants you to attach the top and bottom cabinets and then put the back panel into the top cabinet which requires you to slide it into a slot from the top. But with both cabinets assembled, it almost touches the roof and there's no room to slide the back panel in without tipping the entire cabinet over and hoping for the best. It is also very easy to fray the ends of this back panel and then it doesn't fit into the slots right.Other than this, the cabinet is great looking and made out of real, albeit very cheap, wood. But the back is just cardboard which looks really cheap and it has a giant taped crease in the middle. Also one of the doors for my cabinet came with paint chipping off all over, but all the other pieces were fine.Overall, love this cabinet, but not sure if it was worth the $320 I paid for it. Maybe $200.",

                "reviewText": "After I ordered this once and some of the pieces arrived damaged and missing one piece all together I contacted the company for replacement pieces to the damaged and missing pieces. They agreed and we stayed in touch for over a week and the pieces kept getting delayed so they finally offered me a full refund which I accepted and purchased this same product again with hopes of a better turn out. Upon unboxing the second time the pieces were all there and (mostly) undamaged aside from minor chips in the paint and tiny dings on unseen areas. It went together alright, had a bit of a struggle at times trying to maneuver it but I was doing it by myself. I changed the knobs and drawer pulls to match the existing vanity and cabinet in the bathroom but I highly recommend (unless you're OCD like me and willing to fight for perfect, lol) just use what they send with it lol. I had to drill separate holes for the drawer handles I bought and the screws were too big that came with the handles (washers work miracles lol) they do look nice and are sturdy still and nobody can see the extra hole I drilled in the wrong place underneath it lol.All in all the cabinet itself is nice and exactly what I needed for the great lack of storage in our new house. Took a month pretty much from the time I first ordered it but it was satisfying to finally get all the stuff out of boxes and on a shelf. The company kept up with communication and was very helpful.",
