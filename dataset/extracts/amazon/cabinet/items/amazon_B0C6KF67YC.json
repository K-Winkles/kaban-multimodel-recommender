This shelf is perfect for my needs.It came very well packaged. Every single part was labeled with an easy-to-remove sticker. (Where possible, the stickers were on the sides of the boards. Look for them.)This was the easiest cabinet I have ever assembled. I am a 65-year-old lady and I assembled this by myself in less than an hour. All I needed was a standard Phillips head screwdriver. Every screw hole lined up perfectly. The directions (pictures only) were very clear. Sometimes assembling furniture is a nightmare -- I kept thinking I must be missing something because this was so easy.The cabinet looks nicer than I expected. It has a bright white finish and it is sturdy. The back is screwed on, instead of nailed on with small brads like so many cabinets.I store extra tp in the bottom drawer (8 rolls fit), towels on the other two shelves, and a basket of guest toiletries on the top. Perfect for a guest bathroom.I highly recommend this product. I absolutely love it.",

They assembled flawlessly - instructions were clear, all hardware and panels were numbered and accounted for, and went together quickly with a #2 Philips screwdriver. My wife loves the look, the drawer storage, and shelf display. They are also very solid and secure. Definitely recommended for anywhere that needs slimmer cabinets/shelving.",

                "reviewText": "Update: They replied quickly to my email and sent me the missing screws that week. The bathroom storage piece is nice, just how it looks and the usual good quality from vasagle, especially for the price.Normally I love Vasagle. And the piece itself is great. But it came without an entire pack of the screws necessary to build the drawers.This put a direct halt on my cleaning/storing/organizing for the day. Went to buy the same screws from the hardware store--the rest of the items on the \"make sure everything is there\" chart drawings are to-scale with the actual item in real life. Apparently this one isn't--both screws I got from the hardware store are too thick, and split the wood.So I have emailed Vasagle support to get the pack of P screws that were supposed to come with this but didn't.Until I hear back from them and get a pack of screws from them, this item gets one star. Will change the rating based upon the customer support response. I hate to rate an item for this reason because of a mistake, but the item is useless without the screws, and if they don't send me the missing pack, they deserve 1 star so I will leave it as such. I have spent so much money on past Vasagle items (not that this makes a literal difference, I've worked in retail plenty) that if they are unwilling to ship me a single pack of screws I will go back and change all my vasagle reviews to one star.Hopefully, when you order this, it comes with all of the tools to put it together!",
