Nothing near the corners to get damaged in shipping and every piece protected from the other pieces so no scuffing.Assembly was easy but as they suggested in instructions it was easier with two people. One person could do it but an extra hand here and there helped. All holes lined up perfectly and all hardware was well labeled.Fit in room is perfect! Fills a need we have had since moving in 3 years ago. We are happy with the look and the construction. Would recommend and buy again.",

Maybe with two people, but one person and instructions that are like pictures, frustration! Just take your time and know this will go together but it is awkward on someways you have to build it, but it took me a good 5 hours to do this one. I really think it is sturdy and space to store what we needed it for, and also very pretty and good addition.",

Did not jiggle once put together, seems solid. Inside is roomy, better than I thought it would be. Would recommend!",

While assembling, a strong chemical smell was in the air from the parts. I though little of it as many new items have strong smells from the paint and or glue. The smell seemed unusual though. I place the piece in it's position and went to bed. My eyes were iching badly. I could smell the odor through the closed door. It was worse in the morning and my eyes were swollen. My child eyes started running. I had to put the item outside. I decided to write a review because I want this item recalled if this is a common problem. I not just want to be refunded, this item is not healthy to be in an enclosed space",
