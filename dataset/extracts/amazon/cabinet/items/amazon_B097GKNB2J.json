                "reviewText": "In my laundry room, I have a piece of marble for holding clothes and beneath it is just a dead space. I have tools taking up space on the clothes folding area and it was just a mess. This cabinet without its feet fit perfectly under the clothes folding area, but it is shallow. No worries, I store items behind the cabinet. Those items are not of sight of people, but when people open the laundry room door, they see this beautiful cabinet. The packing of this cabinet, is so well done. The end and top are reinforced with metal and each layer has a protected packing material. Not a scratch or dent anywhere. The instructions were super easy and I had this constructed by myself within 1 hour. I lined the shelves with white liner to protect them and to prevent sliding of things that I store in this. I love that there is a key if you want to lock this cabinet. This is metal, not a very thick metal, but a good prices compared to MDF cabinets that I was considering.",
