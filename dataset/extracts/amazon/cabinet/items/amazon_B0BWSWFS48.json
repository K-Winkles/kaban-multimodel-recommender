                "reviewText": "This kit was amazingly well organized. I was truly impressed. Ive put together many of these over the yrs and none has been so well organized! That being said it did take all of 3 hrs to put together but i managed it just fine all by myself bcuz it was so well organized. Just lay everything out and follow instructions. The instructions are all illustrations. No words. But that was fine. The illustrations were good and easy to follow. Now as for lasting a long time........i cant say im expecting that even though it was well made. The materials are just not something i expect to last the test of time. 2 things i didnt like. The 2nd shelf is not adjustable and the screws for the drawers did not tighten. I was careful not to strip them. They just never tightened up. Dont know what is wrong there but eventually the drawers will loosen on me bcuz of that. Overall im happy and i like the cabinet. It looks very nice in the room.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought three pieces from this company to redo my teenagers' bathroom, and of the three - the other two of which I am very happy with, also skein in this video - this is the one I'm least impressed by.I really do love the esthetic for what it is, and the size and storage for the bathroom are just fine. The problem is with the sturdiness.After assembly, as I pointout in the attached picture and describe it in the video, one of the sides is not securely anchored. It is simply slotted into place with a number of dowels, and this means at every time you pull the drawers open or closed, or try to move the cabinet, it starts to pull apart on that side.If it pulls too far apart, it makes the drawers difficult to open and close, as they fall off the tracks. This issue also meant that when I assembled it in a different room than I intended to use it in, it was really hard to move it in there once it was conplete. I couldn't just pick it up and move it, as I would have fallen apart.I ended up setting it on furniture sliders to get it from one room to the other even though it's not extremely heavy and I could have otherwise moved it on my own (probably jist under 50#.)Even with the furniture sliders, I had to slide it by applying pressure at the base, because if I applied pressure at the top it would still fall apart on that side that I'm pointing to in the picture.Anyway, having said all of that, I really am fine with it for what I needed it for, which was just a refresh to my teenagers' bathroom and a pleasing esthetic overall, which I think it does achieve.The assembly did take me a while, so be prepared for that, but I was able to accomplish it all by myself (although I did have one of my kids hold the cabinet doors in place when I attach the hinges\u2026 it could have been done with just one person, but was easier with someone else to hold them in position.)Initially, I was shipped the wrong piece - the black version of this instead of the white - but I will say that the sellers were incredibly responsive and extremely easy to work with, and replaced it very quickly. In fact, I think I got the replacement shipped to me much faster than the original piece arrived \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.Overall, I'm torn between a 3-star and a 4-star rating, but I'm going to go ahead and go with 4-stars because I am happy with how it looks in the bathroom as a whole... but I may come back and downgrade that if the way it constantly pulls apart on the drawer side becomes too annoying.",

This one has drawers to organize all of those and a cabinet with shelves. It\u2019s a nice height and we dressed it up with a tile topper and hung a front and back lit mirror over it and it looks fabulous. It\u2019s very sturdy and good quality for the price. I am not super handy and it only took me an hour to put it together. The instructions are were straight forward and easy to follow. Love it!",

I\u2019ve had it assembled and airing out for over 3 weeks and it still smells so badly of chemicals. I\u2019ve tried wiping it down, cleaning spray, airing it out - nothing has worked. I bought it to store towels but the towels start smelling extremely strongly of the chemicals after being in the cabinet a short while and I had to rewash all of them. It was that bad. The smell saturated the towels which were dry and clean. This is after being cleaned and aired out for two weeks. I\u2019m so disappointed because this was basically a huge waste of money. I can\u2019t even return it because it\u2019s fully assembled and I threw the box away thinking it just needed to air out. I will probably end up donating or disposing of this because the smell really is that bad that it\u2019s unusable. Huge waste of money. Really wish I hadn\u2019t bought this.",
