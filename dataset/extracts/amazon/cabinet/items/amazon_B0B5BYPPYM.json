My husband is super handy so putting this together was his jam. However, when we got to the file drawers came the challenge. The first drawer doesn't close completely and we can't figure out why. The second drawer he had trouble with the rails not lining up with the screw holes. Even using a magnetic screw driver he had a terrible time lining the rail up to put the screw in. He finally got it in but both drawers do not close flush to the cabinet but they don't look terrible they do seem to lock in place when pushed in, but they aren't flush. I liked the style and I figured if this one goes well I would.biy another one, so I'm still thinking.",

The arrow in the instructions look like you need to push in on the rail, but that's not it. Also, the instructions state clearly on the 2nd page to not use a gun to construct this unit.
