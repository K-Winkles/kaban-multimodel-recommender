I was surprised by how nice the faux bois finish felt, and how sturdy they seemed. I really like that the insides of the doors also have the finished chevron pattern and the cabinet door hinges are really solid and smooth. The cabinets were easy to build, took about 1 hour per cabinet. As I was building them, I kept thinking that whoever works in quality control should get a raise. EVERYTHING went together smoothly and lined up perfectly. That is no easy feat. I think the instructions could be improved with larger print of the letter labels, but that\u2019s minor. 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to be for a little coffee station and it works well so far. I still need to get a mat for the top otherwise it holds all my coffee and accessories with no issues. It was pretty easy to put together. It comes with a small screwdriver, but you may want to get one a little larger in the handle so you don't get hand cramps from the twisting. I like that the hinges are adjustable so you can make the doors fit better versus just simple hinges that aren\u2019t adjustable. Only downside to this is that there is not plastic or felt covers for the feet. There\u2019s a hole for you to nail in plastic covers, but it does not come with them. I think I also would\u2019ve liked the metal piece that the door hit (in the middle) would\u2019ve been magnetic or something to keep the doors firmly shut. Overall I am still really happy with this purchase and how it looks.",

The shipping speed was decent, I ordered Dec. 24 and it arrived Dec 29/30. The two units shipped separately and arrived within a day of each other, which I appreciated because it was nice to have a break in between putting them together. It was quite easy to assemble, we had no issues with the hinges or doors like the other reviews suggested, a drill was much more efficient vs a screw driver. We had all the hardware needed. The pieces were packaged very well and did not get any damage during shipping.I love the soft close feature of the doors. I highly recommend this unit. Great storage space and very aesthetic.",
