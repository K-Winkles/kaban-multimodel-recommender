Easier to assemble with two people, but I managed on saw horses and used masking tape to hold some parts while I lined things up.All parts were in great condition. Fit and finish were good. I could not insert door lock rod bushings, but it works fine without them.Weighs about 95 lbs. Sturdy enough to store misc office supplies, but not likely to serve as a storage spot for cases of papers or heavy tool chests.Nice and deep; about 18\" interior depth. The shelves are adjustable.I would buy again.",

It's clear that it's designed to withstand the test of time and daily use. It has a sleek and professional look thanks to the black finish, which compliments a variety of situations, from the office to the garage. Because it has four shelves that can be adjusted, I was able to personalize the inside so that it could hold objects of varying sizes, ranging from office supplies to power tools. This adaptability is a real game-changer, as it maximizes the utility of the cabinet. The locking mechanism is a valuable feature. It ensures that my confidential files and valuable items are safely stored and can only be accessed by authorized individuals. This extra layer of security brings peace of mind, especially in an office or school setting. I feel that this cabinet is incredibly spacious.

During assembly I kept think if it will be sturdy as the metal is very flimsy. As it kept getting assembled, it kept gaining strength. In the end, it is a very sturdy cabinet with so much space to store everything you have. I used it for my medical spa and it held everything with more room left over. I have placed 5 big boxes of 12 1000cc saline in each box in the bottom shelf. And it holds it with no effort. The doors are strong and solid. The handle and locking mechanism is very strong. Overall, I was very impressed with this cabinet.",
