                "reviewText": "This cabinet is absolutely gorgeous! I did swap out the knobs so they would look more seasonal. Aren\u2019t the little rabbits so cute?! The original handles were small black knobs, so they tie in the same dark tone to match up with the black primary coloring.The cabinet came together pretty easily (I did it alone, though two people are recommended). It is very sturdy and has one shelf dividing the inside. It has a few different height adjustments available with the little notch pieces.The instructions were very clear and it came out beautifully. The doors are the best EVER! They just slip into place once you put the hardware on. Other doors need to be held super specifically and drilled in and usually come out uneven. This was so easy and simple to slip on. There were no major chipping spots and the pieces were well packed.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this little entry cabinet! It is beautiful, matches multiple decoration styles, and is so simple, yet so elegant.I can\u2019t recommend this one enough and it will FOR SURE be a talking point for guests and family visitors.GET YA ONE! 5/5",

Once opened and preparing to assemble, my fianc\u00e9 actually took notice of the tools included, mostly the screw driver. The screw driver that comes with this buffet is a unique two in one screw driver that goes from flat to 4 way in seconds. He really loved the screw driver. That attention to detail is appreciated.For the buffet itself, it is beautiful. It took my fianc\u00e9 maybe 35 to 40 minutes to assemble and the instructions were pretty straightforward. It is great quality, even being that it is not a real wood piece, it is sturdy and well manufactured. The cane webbing is in perfect condition. This buffet has added a lot of character to our kitchen. I love it. It holds more than I expected and looks stunning. I love the cane webbing and the different toned color of the rest of the table. Overall, this is a perfect piece for me and my home.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this buffet cabinet to replace a shelf I use as a coffee station and cup storage. The screw driver included is a great gift, really handy and comfortable: though I was able to use the bit on my handheld drill to make things faster.The assembly was fairly easy once you remove everything from the packaging and sort. I would say this took my spouse and I about an hour start to finish. The packaging makes a lot of waste, so I recommend sorting and disposing of the packaging first. The instructions leave something to be desired, but the images are pretty clear at explaining assembly.Given the price range for the single cabinet of 59.99, I would say the faux wood is acceptable and of decent quality. This cabinet is a nice piece but not designed for excess weight. I would definitely recommend this is as a temporary replacement, but not something likely to last a lifetime because of the faux wood and thin paneling.",

The two shelves each have so much room for stacking or for standing up tall books on etc. It is all deep enough that you don't have to worry that the most standard games boxes will fit - or anything a little wider or taller than normal. It took a bit of time to put it together but only because it is super sturdy and well built. Very happy with this cabinet!",

                "reviewText": "I do like this buffet cabinet, so let me start off by saying that. It looks nice and it\u2019s fairly sturdy and has plenty of storage inside. The only reason I really deducted a star was because assembly could have been a bit easier. They could\u2019ve used a little bit higher quality hardware. However, it did come with one of the nicest included screwdrivers to do the work I have ever seen. However none of my drillbits really fit the hardware in this piece of furniture and so I was forced to use the nice screwdriver to assemble. Overall assembly was easy but if you have problems with your hands like I do then you might want to know that a power drill or power screwdriver may not work for you.The other thing I did not love is the faux wood around the wicker. The black wood looks great, but the lighter color wood looks a bit faker up close than I would have liked. I also am curious if the door hinges will hold up overtime they seemed a little flimsy but they\u2019re not holding very heavy doors so they might just be fine.Overall good product with lots of storage inside. Looks nice but we\u2019ll see how it holds up durability wise and I\u2019m still on the fence whether I like the lighter colored wood, because it just kinda looks fake up close.",
