I had purchased a covered shoe rack that zipped on both sides less than 2 yrs ago, but that material began to disintegrate and ripped, so I went in search of a shoe wrack and storage to replace it. So far so good. I have 6 lbs worth of folded sweaters and hoodies in a storage bag on top of this unit that has boots and shoes in each of the cubes. I love this purchase and recommend for bedrooms, mudrooms, small kids toys and of course shoes. Well worth money paid.",
