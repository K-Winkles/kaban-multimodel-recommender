                "reviewText": "I live in a small apartment and I needed a nice sized bar for a corner in my apartment. I did not want to spend a lot of money, but I was looking for something that would hold tall bottles. This was a great option for the price. Yes, it comes in several sections - and this might be easier put together with two people. However, I am a 5 foot woman and I had no issues putting this together. You just have to be a little bit creative but the end product is lovely.This is a very sturdy white material. It\u2019s not glossy - it\u2019s more on the textured side. However, I like this because it gives it more of a high end look. I was also pleasantly surprised with the doors because the pattern also gives it an upscale look. I actually did not put the door knobs that came with the unit \u2013 I purchased some gold knobs and it looks lovely.I also like the fact that the shelves are removable. Therefore, I only used one which allows me to have tall bottles on both shelves. Overall, great quality for the price.",

However the product looks really nice once its put together. I set the thing up by myself and it took maybe took a total of 3 hours to put together as the instructions were not very clear when they arrived, would recommend having two people if you have the option to do it. I also received some of the parts damaged as you can see through the pictures. Luckily most of the items we're damaged that faced the inside of the cabinet or the bottom so you don't see the damages. When placing in the shelving as well, it does recommend using an electric drill to put in the screws they provide you into tiny holes that you can barely see if you don't have a lot of light. The electric drill didn't do much for me so I did everything by hand as it was easier. It does provide screws for you to place it into the wall to make it sturdier. Overall, I would say its a decent item, I love the mesh doors but I wouldn't recommend putting anything on top of it thats heavy unless you screw the item into the wall for more support.",

I almost didn't get it because of the complaints about how hard it was to put together and you have to buy different screws and the holes don't match, etc.I decided to give it a chance and bought two blue ones because they matched my paint perfectly. All the holes match up. The screws work just fine. I will say that the directions are very confusing.. very short sentence and the drawings leave something to be desired - BUT - if you look at the pieces at the top and bottom and match the screws holes, you can almost do it blindfolded.One truth about the difficulty is that parts C and D are swapped in the directions. If you put D on the left and C on the right, it's a piece of cake.Love them. May order more in black.\u2764\ufe0f",

We love it and worked perfect for us.It was difficult to assemble and instructions were not clear.Put the screws for the legs first to hold it together.

I appreciate how high the cabinet is. He assembly was pretty easy despite what some people say in their reviews. No more complicated than IKEA furniture. The levelling legs were an added benefit, ensuring that the cabinet does not rattle or wiggle.I will say, though that this is metal and anytime you are opening a metal door that has a magnetic clasp. It\u2019s going to make more noise then something like a wood, which will not produce an echo. I notice it more so when I\u2019m closing the cabinet versus opening yet.The mesh doors are nice but it definitely doesn\u2019t hide things at all.My one disappointment is how easy this cabinet can scratch. I put a ceramic pot on top of it, and slid the pot over , because there was a rough granular piece of the ceramic. It\u2019s scratched the top of it. The scratch was minor but obviously when you have something brand new, you\u2019d like to keep it looking that way. Regardless, I would still buy this again as we are very happy with it.",
