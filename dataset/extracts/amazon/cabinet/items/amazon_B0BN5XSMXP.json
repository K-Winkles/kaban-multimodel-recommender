It\u2019s as sturdy as any of these kind of self-assembled furniture are and it looks really nice. Not sure if I\u2019d want to put anything super heavy in it but I\u2019m using it for a linen cabinet. If you use it as kitchen storage maybe keep the cast iron pans and Dutch ovens somewhere else. Or at least on the very bottom shelf.It was missing the little dowels that hold up the adjustable shelf but everything else was included. I had to pick some up at the hardware store so annoying but not the end of the world. If not for that I\u2019d give 5 stars.",

It took a couple hours to put together by myself because of the sheer number of pieces. This cabinet is the typical fiber board material, you have to be careful not to over-screw in the hardware. -I only did that once, on an inside area that no one will see. I was missing a couple \"N\" screws, but luckily I had some of my own. One of the cabinet doors is higher than the other because the predrilled starter marks are off center, I will have to go back and fix that next weekend.. but it is in the utility room, so no one is going to care.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these units for my mom and dad to use in their large bathroom. When they arrived I was worried as one box was very dirty and looked like it sat in water and had dried out. Once I got the box opened, everything was good. The instructions are easy to follow and the only thing I suggest is a third hand when you go to install the doors. The value and sturdiness for the amount paid is very reasonable. The materials are what they are press boards and very thin backing, however, they make up for this with hardware to stiffen the backing and the rest of the materials are supported by additional hardware as well. I found screws that had no threads, however you are given extra of just about all hardware, one to two pieces, so assembly should not be a problem once you get started. As long as you are not in a rush and follow the applications, you get a very worthy product at the end. I recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "Once assembled the cabinet is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. It took me about 3 hours to complete. I could have assembled it quicker but I screwed in a couple pieces incorrectly.There are a few issue:1. This cabinet has a VERY STRONG chemical odor. Thankfully I could store it in my garage it took a week for the odor to dissipate.2. A couple of the screws tops weren't aligned and made it difficult to screw into the board3 Just a note for step 9 don't use a drill as you can see from my picture even on slow speed the nail will pierce the other side",
