                "reviewText": "We have a small kitchen that has very few cabinets and no pantry. I have been looking for the perfect size pantry cabinet for quite some time to fit next to this minuscule kitchen in the only spot available. It needed to not be very deep, but tall, at least 7 ft, to give us plenty of storage space, because this was going to be a tight fit. I also wanted it to look nice, preferably wood and have a modern look to it, but not cost an arm and a leg. I had spent about six months looking and could not find anything with those specifications. Time to settle for function over form. This is a great cabinet! Yes, it\u2019s metal, which isn\u2019t great for in the house, but it really doesn\u2019t look too bad. It is very well-made and I was able to put it together without any help from my husband. The directions were understandable and all the pre-drilled holes were actually lined up right. It is very sturdy, and each shelf can hold a lot of weight, as you can see in the picture where some of the shelves have a lot of canned goods on them. I love the fact that it has a small cabinet on the top that can be locked, so I can put goodies in there that can be kept secure from kids who like to raid them. Could see it being used for other things, such as alcohol if you have older kids in your home and don\u2019t want watered-down vodka. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase.",

I think each one took me about 30 minutes start to finish. They are sturdy and good quality and provide a TON of space. I love the extra top space for the added height and storage space. I also like the option to remove it if desired. Great cabinets!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased 3 of these cabinets for our new house June 2023. My husband is VERY handy and fully capable of most house-related repairs etc. He *HATED* these instructions to put these together. He said he was very tempted to send all 3 back as he tried to get the first one together. He luckily managed to just work his way through the parts on the first one and got it built by figuring it out himself. He could then put the remaining two together from memory. He started at 7am and wasn't done with all 3 until 2pm. He had to take breaks to cuss the cabinets out several times. The last box was an obvious return and one portion of the metal was bent. (Assumed that's why it was returned by someone else.) He refused to send it back because of the effort he'd put in so far that day. He managed to unbend that section and make it work. If that had been the first box we opened, he would have sent all 3 back to the vendor. Now that all 3 are put together and in the garage, they are beautiful, sturdy, and exactly what we wanted. If you chose to order these, just know that the headache to put these together may not be worth it to you.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a locking metal cabinet to keep organizations documents in. A safe would have been overkill. Looked at Staples and cabinets were way more than we wanted to pay. Then looked on Amazon and the thing that caught my eye was that this one came with 4 keys. That was a major advantage as our group leadership needed keys so we didn't have to keep arranging to get a key.The package was very heavy (79 pounds) but I was able to maneuver it with a small hand cart. Once I got the box open I saw it was very well packed with steel end caps and hard board sheets on all four sides. Inside everything was incase in a filmy material and foam.It was very easy to assemble. Only difficult parts in the assembly were:1. the doors which are supposed to be installed after the bottom and top of the cabinet were fastened together and the shelves installed. That made it impossible to fit the door pivot pins into the holes at the top and bottom. I ended up removing the top pieces screws fitting pins into the holes and then reaffixing the screws.2. the small plastic wedges that were supposed to snap in above every shelf to hold it in place. I just couldn't get them to fit into the slots so I gave up. As long as we don't knock it over the shelves should be fine without them.So this cabinet will meet our needs for the time being with 4 shelves and lots of space to keep our required documents reasonably secure.",
