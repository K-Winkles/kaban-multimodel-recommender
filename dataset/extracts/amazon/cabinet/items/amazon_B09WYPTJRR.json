It was a loose base but once you screwed to flat piece was very sturdy. Rest of pieces was breeze to put together. It cam out beautiful it is heavy and has anchor screws as well for the wall. I wanted extra space on my bathroom counter and to draw your eye up this was perfect. I will be changing light fixture so it fits better. But overall great buy for the money.",

I gave 4 stars because one of the panels came damaged with a small crack in the corner. It was not worth trying to replace so I put it together as is. Directions were not the greatest, but just take your time and it goes together pretty easy. I had all parts needed and all holes where they needed to be. So far it has been working out great.",
