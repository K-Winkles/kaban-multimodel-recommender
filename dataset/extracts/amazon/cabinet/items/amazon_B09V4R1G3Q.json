                "reviewText": "I don't do a lot of product reviews, but felt the need to say something about this product and the company. I was nervous about ordering this shelf online,as you never know what your going to get these days, but haven't had a lot of time lately and needed a solution that I didn't have to spend a lot of time shopping for. So I read reviews and took a chance.This product was delivered very poorly by the delivery service that brought it to my house. It was literally thrown out in the middle of my driveway and pieces of the packing were all over from the bottom of my driveway to the top. The box was ripped open and heavily dented on one corner, there was a pile of small metal pieces unceremoniously dumped on the top of the box. Many were heavily dented and damaged. Some of the shelves were literally falling out of the box. I contacted this company right away to explain the situation. They asked me to send pictures of the packing, labels, ect., I was surprised and skeptical when they told me to set up the product and let them know which pieces were actually damaged so they could send me replacements. Here's the thing. Many of what I thought were damaged pieces were actually metal encased packaging blocks. I've never seen such thorough packaging . I can't imagine what condition this piece of furniture would have been in without those.We were pleasantly surprised when we assembled this cabinet, to find that even with the gross mishandling of the shipping company, the actual unit itself was made of very heavy duty, quality metal and was in very good structural condition despite some scratches and dents. Upon opening everything up, my husband was ecstatic to find easy to follow assembly instruction AND all of the parts separated and meticulously labeled to match the instructions. They even included the tools needed (a screwdriver) and a few extra parts for assembly. This used to be fairly commonplace, but in my experience as of late, these little details have been sorely lacking in many furniture items I have assembled.The next thing that struck me as above average was the quality of the paint job. Despite dents and scratches (again, not the company's fault), the integrity of the paint job stayed in tact. Many units would have chipping paint with that kind of damage. This one didn't. Long story, short, once I had it all put together, it still looked pretty good especially considering everything it had been through. So I contacted the company again and told them I would keep the cabinet. They still gave me a refund for the damaged pieces and were very pleasant through the whole process.The delivery service problems weren't the company's fault, but they did everything I asked to make it right and I'm really happy with the structural quality and packaging of this product. Thank you for a great cabinet and a great experience with your company. I would definitely purchase from this company again. They are definitely an above average seller and make a very quality metal cabinet.",

                "reviewText": "I am glad I opted for a metal closet over a wooden one, because this is far more sturdy compared to a wooden closet that I would have to build myself. It holds quite a bit, and it was not that hard to put together. I have minimal furniture assembly experience and I put it together with my sister in about 4-5 hours. The only thing that bothers me is that the door does not close until you completely lock it. If you don\u2019t lock it, the door stays slightly open, and it can be a bit annoying. Plus, the doors are quite hard to lock, you have to kind of push the door so both the bottom and top locks line up. Also the material catches fingerprints pretty easily, but it can be easily wiped down.",

This thing is pretty sturdy and once it's full, it's more than heavy enough to stay put. It also holds more stuff than I thought it would. I even put about 30 extra pounds plants on top and it's not bending. I havent completely organized the closet yet, so this pic is not the final. I'm pleased to have enough space, where I don't need two of these for my clothes. I had someone put it together for me because I'm lazy. It was only one person and he was done in like an hour or so. He said it wasn't hard to assemble. I do have to say that there were a few dings that came with the first cabinet. It wasn't unbearable, but when you buy new, you expect new. The sellers were extremely kind and gracious. They shipped me a replacement and quickly! It is very hard to find great customer service these days! This company took care of me. I'll be using this seller again!! Trust me, buy the storage cabinet.",
