A couple do the diagrams took a little bit to figure out. Once done, this thing looks great! It feels super sturdy. One important thing- the hinges are adjustable and include directions so you can make the doors fit in just the right positions. The shelves are also adjustable so I can actually fit my large rotisserie in the bottom of one with more room!",

Originally I thought I was missing a part but just needed to read the directions more closely. Adjusting the doors is a pain! I eventually just gave up and will live with the slight gap between one set of doors.Piece looks nice despite the wood not being the best quality.",

I did have my older teen daughter help for a little while, then my husband helped some, but it still took about 5 1/2 hours to put together. And the doors are not even and one drawer is wonky. It is fine since we still have little kids in the house that will be using it, so I'd rather not spend a lot of money on something they will probably not take great care of, but overall it looks good in our dining room. I'm using half as a coffee bar and the other side for homeschool storage. It works for what I needed. It does provide a good amount of storage space. I was able to put mugs, syrups, and coffee pods on one side, and plenty of room in the other for all their school and art supplies. I will definitely upgrade at some point, but it does the job for now.",

Instructions were easy to follow and the smaller assembly parts had extras in case of loosing one which is always a relief. Once it is put together it looks very nice!! It really is perfect for what we needed. The seller was also very helpful, we had an issue with FedEx delivering it to the completely wrong address and the seller kindly shipped us a new one. Excellent all around!",

The packaging was fantastic and no damage in shipping even though the outer box was damaged. I love the overall look of the furniture. My don\u2019t likes are the drawers don\u2019t line up great and neither do the doors. I know there is a way to adjust them but I haven\u2019t figured it out. The knobs that were included are a cheap fake gold color not black like shown in the photo. The drawers are narrow, I was planning on putting my table placemats there but they did not fit. I would say the unit feels a bit flimsy but what I put in it is holding. The finish gets damaged very easily especially durning the process of putting it together.",
