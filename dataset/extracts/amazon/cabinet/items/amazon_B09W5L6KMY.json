                "reviewText": "The cabinet is nice. It was easy to assemble - it took me about an hour and that's because I went slow. I wanted to make sure all the screws were secured properly to prevent the cabinet from feeling wobbly or falling apart under the weight of being used for storing toiletries in the bathroom. I did notice that you have to be careful when moving the cabinet, as it can easily scuff and scratch. I gave the cabinet 3 stars. The reason is - the photo used to depict/sell the cabinet is not accurate. The base of the cabinet that I received was Black metal, not Gold as pictured on the Amazon site, which I think is pretty deceptive. I'm kicking myself for not looking more closely at the posted reviews with photos from prior purchasers AND for not reading the product description, which says \"steel legs\". Had I caught this significant difference, I would not have purchased this cabinet. Although I debated returning the cabinet, I didn't want to go through the hassle of reboxing and lugging it to an Amazon drop-off. Again, it's a nice cabinet, it's just not the one pictured.Update: after posting my review, the photo was updated to match the cabinet received. The seller was very responsive and reached out to offer assistance on making things right. I'm satisfied with the the seller taking action to post an accurate picture of the cabinet. So I've updated my rating to 4 stars.",

I needed a shorter cabinet to fit under some floating shelves, and this is the perfect height to fit underneath the shelves with room to spare for my bar tool set and shaker.",
