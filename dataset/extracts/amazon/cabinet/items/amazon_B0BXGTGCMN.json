This holds many bottles of wine and other supplies. It is sturdy and feels much more stable than expected. It was easy to put together with my 8 year old helping. Door hinges are adjustable and soft close, bonus! Only downside was the tabs to hold the upper shelf are a little small. Sturdy enough but we bought some shelf stabilizers to use instead. Overall, great purchase and so happy this corner of my house is complete!",

I did need assistance with the doors but mostly because I\u2019m very pregnant and couldnt see the screw holes comfortable. And extra plus that it comes with wall security latches, so if you have littles ones who like to climb you can use them to secure the cabinet to the wall.",

                "reviewText": "The sellers are absolutely amazing and made an incorrect delivery right. Hence the reason for a hiccup in the title. But they fixed it ASAP. So wonderful! I recommend them so highly!These two cabinets fit in my kitchen perfectly so I can store my extra holiday/serving ware. We have a lot of windows in our kitchen/nook that we needed a narrow/specific height furniture piece and these two were PERFECT! Even with the delivery hiccup it made it right before the holidays so I could also place food buffet style on top which made the dining table feel more comfortable with no clutter.We have another piece previously purchased (the shoe cabinet I\u2019m using as our coffee bar, just thinking outside the box and it has been a hit) that\u2019s also in our kitchen too. I love that piece so much I just had to add these to this space! This style goes perfectly with our home.All items we\u2019ve gotten from them were well packaged and easy to put together. I do recommend using a drill if you are familiar with using one. Your hand may get tired screwing the pieces together.The boxes they arrive in are heavy(to be expected), so if you have a hard time lifting items you may need some help.Thank you for the lovely customer service and for the beautiful pieces.",
