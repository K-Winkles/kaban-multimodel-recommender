                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Well, at least the directions were pretty clear and easy to understand as the parts were all clearly marked. Also, they give you 1 extra of every screw, washer,bolt and so on. The biggest issue-the ratan on the doors ins not on straight, some areas stretched and on some of doors popping off the backing -like there is no glue on some spots. Also, as previously in another review mentioned-the trim of door/insert ratan is not painted well and see dark spots. And of course-the doors don't quite line up to frame but a plus for having adjustable screw on bottom of legs to prevent wabbling. All and all-for $80\u2010its ok",
