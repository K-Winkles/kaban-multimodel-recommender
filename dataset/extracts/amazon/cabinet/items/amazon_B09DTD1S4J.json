Decided on these cabinets for both bathrooms, and they look great!My brother put them together and installed them. Seems like they were pretty easy.Minor quibble(s): on one, the doors firmly stuck to the magnetic backplate when closed. On the other, one of the doors wouldn't firmly click closed but kept popping back off. Eventually, I had to fiddle with unscrewing the magnetic pieces and slightly fiddling with placement [there was slight play in the positioning without having to completely remove the pieces]. Managed to get alignment \"just close enough\" that the door seems to actually stay put now and not click off the magnetic back plate, but it was tricky and I had to fiddle with it a couple times.Also, just inspecting it, after my brother installed it, it serms like there's only two attachment screws connecting it to the wall. Not sure if it comes pre-drilled that way, or not? But, I feel like it may need a couple more screws anchored into the drywall or whatnot, in hopes that more attachment points might make it less likely to somehow come off the wall?Overall, nice cabinet, classy, seems reasonably well-made from my layman's perspective. And matches the color scheme of the other decor / cabinets pretty well...",

                "reviewText": "We needed a spot to put our tools, because they pile up in the kitchen. I figured out that the issue was we needed storage that was in line of sight from the front and back door. Wall mounted items are critical in our house and they keep our horizontal spaces clean. It holds the drill, several screw drivers, a drill battery charging station, etc and then screw boxes etc on the shelf. I added a battery operated light to the underside of the shelf. Works great for our needs! I plan to add a little dollar tree peg board so that it is less messy, but for now, it keeps tools out of sight and away from our toddler. Oh, and we did drill a hole in the back so we could run the charger cord down the wall. It makes a messy and dirty set of items a lot more organized and helps me breathe in our space!",

Amazon is the cheapest price.. u can get this to home depot and target but those are much expensive for the same model.",

                "reviewText": "This is a cheap unit, as expected, not a good solid wood piece\u2026but that part is pretty obvious. The biggest issue is the pre-drilled holes are all either too loose, (for the dowels and cam locks), or too small, (for the screws). This would not even be a huge issue IF the screws were not so cheap. The screws strip out constantly (even with hand tightening them all), and they don\u2019t give you any extra, meaning you WILL have to go to your local hardware store and find some matching tiny wood screws to finish assembly.Additionally they include no plastic screw head covers for the cam locks and 4 large silver screws on the bottom\u2026looks cheap, and unprofessional. Would NOT recommend.",
