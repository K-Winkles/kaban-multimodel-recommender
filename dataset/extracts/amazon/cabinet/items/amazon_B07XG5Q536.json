                "reviewText": "This is a nice looking cabinet.And the instructions are pretty good even though I somewhat didn't really assemble it well.When you are building it, on step one, don't fully tighten the two sides together without going to the next step and putting the wooden strip across the front. You will have to loosen one of the sides again to get it on. Just putting that tip out there to save someone else a minor bit of hassle.Anyway, it's ok in terms of sturdyness. There is nothing wrong, and it doesn't wobble. It's not really tall enough that you need to bother fastening it to a wall unless you have children who might pull it over. There is a bit of weight on it, especially on the top so that's something to consider.The back is just that cardboard type wood and you screw nails into it. That's about what you get with most furniture items anyway so that's ok.The shelves are held on with little metal plugs and you slot the shelves in on top. That's nice because it allows you to easily adjust them.I'm personally just not a fan of those cams we have to use to get these in. I don't mind screwing in from the top and covering it up with a plastic plug. The cams are a nuisance to use.But it seems to have a decent quality and look to it.Why only a three, then?It's about value for money. We are looking for storage space and this is $250.00. I mean it's nice to look at but it's not like we can get much in there. Looking around Amazon you can get more storage in nice looking cabinets or closets for about the same amount of money.If you want this for the aesthetic of it then maybe you can use this. But then I can't see how it's worth spending that much money on it for that reason alone.Don't get me wrong, I like this and it's fairly solid. But I wish it was a bit taller or perhaps wider.",

                "reviewText": "I've assembled a lot of furniture in my life, and although this was not THEE worst, it's up there.I'll start out with some nice comments: the hardware was neatly packaged and nothing was missing. You only need one philips screwdriver to assemble this. All the furniture panels were packed carefully and nothing was damaged.There is a booklet of instructions, but unfortunately some parts are so vague they are useless. I had to do some trial and error to find out which way certain portions were to be oriented, and at one point I had to take half of it apart and start over.I used a hand-held screwdriver to assemble the entire thing, rather than a power drill, because the particle board was so soft I could feel it crumbling and giving way from just gentle hand-screwing of the screws. Multiple areas developed fine, long cracks in the material while putting the screws in.It was heartbreaking spending an hour and a half assembling this only to realize how wobbly and flimsy it is. This is probably the flimsiest piece of furniture I've ever had. I've picked trash furniture off the side of the road that is far, far sturdier than this. I've purchased furniture kits from many inexpensive retailers and nothing has ever approached this level of shoddiness. This is a new low.This is so flimsy that when I moved it from one room to another, I had to squat down and wrap my arms around it in a bear hug rather than picking it up like a normal piece of furniture; I was afraid it was going to fall apart on me. Scooting it around would loosen the screws, which are already in super soft, crumbling particle board that has cracks.The paint finish is applied very poorly; it's inconsistently smooth and downright textured/see-through in some areas. It's especially bad around the door trim where there are big cracks and pile-ups of sawdust that have a half-hearted, incomplete layer of paint sprayed over them.The door magnets are basically worthless; a person walking past would blow these open. Either they are too weak, or they are set back too far from the doors.There's a gap between the doors when they are closed.There's a gap between the two back panels of the cabinet, which is supposed to be covered up with a super cheap plastic strip, but the strip leaves a gap of its own at the top and bottom of the panels.There's also a slightly ominous label on the back panels announcing that the product contains chemicals known to cause cancer. I guess I'd really like to know which chemicals those are and which areas of the product contain them. Lead based paint on the exterior is a whole different ball of wax than say, a little copper or cadmium mixed into the metal components.I guess worst of all is that this is grossly overpriced. It's overpriced even if it was a stable, sturdy piece. In it's current state, I might guess it was some kind of super-economy thing that was selling for $50-75. And at that price, I'd still be kinda mad and complaining.But it's retailing for $242.I just CANNOT.The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because:1. It looks good from a distance2. The top is really nice: thick and dimensional with attractive trim; it feels substantial3. All the holes were drilled precisely so that the parts lined up without fail during assemblyAlso, just a P.S.: the product information lists the cabinet dimensions TWICE as 15\" x 34\" x 10\". Obviously, that's not correct. I measured it and it is 34 x 26 x 13\".AND, it states that the door knobs are \"clear.\" No. They are shiny chrome finish.",

                "reviewText": "I got this great little cabinet for my bathroom at a deep (72%) discount because of a few small imperfections that are super easy and in expensive to fix. It lists at $135.56 and I paid $40.37 through Amazon used. As you can see from the photos most of the imperfections are tiny. The larger ones are still easily fixed. The inside of the cabinet fixes I will be addressing with white contact paper from the 99 cent store-yep gonna spend a whole buck for that! The cabinet is surprisingly sturdy if you tighten down the screws really well and I\u2019ve also glued the dowels with wood glue. The only other issue is that they are prehung doors and they will have to be tweaked a little to align perfectly and look level. I also have an extra cabinet magnet which I will be attaching to the bottom to make sure that the cabinet panels remain flush when they are closed. That said a great little product! Made with MDF and not particleboard sets this product a little higher and on the affordability scale. I have purchased an expensive furniture before and it is so much better than those particleboard versions. I can honestly say I am very happy about this product! I\u2019m not sure what sharing this means so I didn\u2019t read it for that. It is white and it is a solid white.",
