                "reviewText": "This corner cabinet is compact in size so if you\u2019re looking for something with a lot of storage space, you won\u2019t find it with this item. The overall look and feel of the cabinet is classic and simplistic in appearance. The detailing on the cabinet doors is a sophisticated design and the hardware has that distressed metal texture to it. I bought this item in a previously used condition which was an affordable option. I\u2019ve had good luck when buying products from the marked down/used section of item listings on Amazon though. Every time I have, the item was brand new and had just been an open boxed item the previous customer returned. This product was no different and arrived in brand new condition. It hadn\u2019t ever been taken out of the box before and was in perfect condition. The reason it was marked down to $28 from $89 was due to it missing a piece. Easy fix though because this company has incredible customer service and were happy to send me the piece I needed rather than having to deal with the hassle of returning it. I would definitely recommend purchasing from UTEX and will continue to do so in the future.",
