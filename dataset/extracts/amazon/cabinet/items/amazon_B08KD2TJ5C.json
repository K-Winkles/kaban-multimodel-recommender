It was easy to assemble and fit perfectly in the corner I wanted it in. I love that I can change the height of the shelf inside and it looks so clean. My only issue is that the door doesn't latch well. It has a magnet latch but it must not be strong enough as the doors tend to swing open. I'll probably just see about adding on a magnetic child lock as I don't want my kitten getting into it.",
