                "reviewText": "WARNING!:The Review you are about to read was not paid for. This product was bought with the reviewers own money and the reviewer is giving their own honest opinions and on this product. With that out of the way... Let's begin.I got a new desk recently. An elephance black oak corner desk And while it is really nice.. I needed a small filing cabinet to go beside it to hold a few books, my sketchbooks, and a few other useless office knick knacks. Because I went with a slightly modern looking steel and black oak veneer particle board desk, I needed a cabinet that matched. After spending an eternity and feeling like I aged a hundred years in a couple hours time, I came across this filing cabinet. It matched the desk in design and colour. I instantly fell in love with it.However, I almost didn't buy it because their was not enough reviews about it. I will be honest on that. It is always a gamble and I was heavily debating on it for this reason alone. But I decided to bite the bullet and give it a shot. And I am glad I did. The packaging is phenomenal and perfectly protects all the parts for the filing cabinet. Once opened, you will find m everything is labeled. It comes with all the tools you'll need. Including a Philips head screwdriver. I mean, no company I have ever bought a product from gives away a free Philips head screwdriver. Free Allen wrenches? yeah. They are always willing to give those away because they are just a piece of cheap metal. But free Philips head screwdrivers? who is going to complain about getting a free Philips head screwdriver? Not me.The installation instructions are all on one single page and are well detailed. You can get this thing fully assembled in 30 minutes. It is that easy. Every single screw hole seems to be correctly placed though you will need to fenagle a lil with the main cabinets top and bottom assembly to align screw holes and peg holes. Honestly... what product seriously doesn't have you fenagle it a lil' while assembling it? Everything does. So yeah it should not come as any major surprise that you got to do it with this too.My only slight pet peeve is that they didn't provide drill holes to screw the cabinet door lock in place. Instead it relies on you to screw the screws in place. That is annoying but it came out alright in the end. Nothing to really mark this down a star. But best put some oomph into getting those screws to screw into it.The cabinet is quite sturdy being a combination of steel and particle board. I was quite surprised. But then honestly I shouldn't be. I've dealt with particle board products for years. While it is not perfect like real wood. It still take on a decent amount of weight. I am a tad heavy set and so to test it to see if it could live up to it's particle board ancestors... So I sat on it. It took the weight like a champ though I really think the steel took more the brunt of my weight. So the particle board was able to handle me with ease. If it can handle my weight, You could set an old 32\" CRT TV on top of this and it will handle the weight.One of the other nice features about it is that you have a built in 2 -electrical outlets with 3 USB-A female charging ports. It makes it far easier to hook up things like a a TV, lamp, mini drink fridge (like the fridgidare ones) or a printer.The charging ports a nice touch. But do not have enough wattage to charge my pixel 6 phone or iPad tablet. Maybe enough for charging a fitbit watch. But that is about it. Their is enough to power a USB light or run a small USB fan. That's all I can recommend doing with those ports.Overall, I am extremely happy with this product! Unikito made a great lil filing cabinet. That is not just tough, it was built to last. If you have a desk that matches this filing cabinet, then I will highly recommend that you get this! You seriously will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Browsing for a printer stand I came across the Unikito File Cabinet. It has a practical and sleek design, offering both functionality with its spacious storage and lockable doors for security, and style that complements any office setting. Additionally, the emphasis on mobility and ease of assembly with its rolling casters and straightforward instructions would be commended for adding flexibility and convenience to office organizationAssembly is straightforward if you are used to doing some IKEA stuff. Took us about an hour with 2 adults.At our home office it acts as an excellent charging hub for a family's tech needs, with its built-in power outlets and USB charging ports. These features make it easy to simultaneously charge multiple devices such as printers, tablets, phones, and smart watches, keeping everything organized and accessible in one place. This convenience is especially beneficial for a family looking to centralize their tech in a neat and efficient manner.",

This frustrated me during assembly, but the good news is the \"C\" panel, which apparently is one that other reviewers have had this issue with, is simple enough to drill holes in at the proper location. The better news is that the unsightly holes are on the underside of the cabinet, so at the end of the day, it's a minor gripe.Incidentally, I had written customer support during the peak of my annoyed phase, and the response was quick and ready to help. They were going to mail me out a replacement panel and asked me to check for any other errors. I confirmed all was in working order, including the power strip, which some had issues with.The only other slight setback is that the cable organizer puck is not a tight fit- it slips right out. I fixed that issue with Superglue. The center of the puck can still pop out to accommodate more cables.All told, I am really liking the setup.",
