Spoke with Amazon to solve problem and no one is trying to help. This is the a picture I took From being annoyed with having to do extra work to make this product work. Holes didn\u2019t align properly. Had to make extra holes to make work. Product was very difficult to put together since items were missing but the most irritating part is not knowing until you are halfway or almost done. Looks very cheap and very upset with the product and the customer service",

                "reviewText": "The delivery was fast and it's easy to assemble. It also looks sturdy and great. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the missing screws. I didn't realize that until I had moved everything upstairs and halfway through the steps of assembling. I didn't want to undo everything so I had to use my own screws. Other than that it's a good product overall, and I would give it 4 or 5 stars.",
