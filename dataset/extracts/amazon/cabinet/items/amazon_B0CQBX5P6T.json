We had a plastic drawer storage cart, but the bins were breaking and I wanted something that not only stored a lot, but looked nice too. This looked promising and I am so happy with it. It holds tons of stuff and looks so, so nice once assembled. It took over an hour to get all of the pieces together, but that was simply due to the number of pieces not the complexity. The directions were mostly pictorial. If you have ever assembled IKEA furniture, you will be fine. The assembled cabinet is a little wobbly when opened, not like it's going to fall over, just a little wiggley. For the price though, I sort of expected that. It's not the highest end cabinet, but it services its purpose well.",

                "reviewText": "To start, the listing did not lie when it said this item has lots of pieces. It's got a ton of pieces and it's a project to put together. I'm a small person and it took me a few hours to do by myself. I'm not really good at following directions and I only had to redo a couple of things.The back is cardboard, but it's thicker than some other cardboard backs you might get with budget furniture. And, instead of nailing it on, it slides into a groove.Overall, this cabinet is really nice looking and has a lot of space.",

Took my husband an hour or so to put together and we are very pleased with the quality. The instructions for putting this cabinet together was the absolute easiest too follow. All parts were there, every piece was labelled and they were illustrated as well as clear! It gives me large storage space with variant size! Highly recommended!",
