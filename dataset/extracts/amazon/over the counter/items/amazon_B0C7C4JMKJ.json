I have it holding a microwave and a separate convection oven, and a large Excalibir dehydrator on top. The shelves are adjustable in height, so you can customize the rack for what you are putting on it. I like that it has a side rack for holding cutting boards, plus a towel rack, plus two sizes (8 each!) of hooks for holding additional objects. It is so convenient to have things handy. I added a magnetic paper towel rack to the side also.I definitely recommend this rack for any kitchen! It certainly cleared up a lot of counter space and looks great, while making appliances more convenient to use.",

                "reviewText": "Living in an RV, counterspace is at a premium, and the designer\u2019s choice to put the microwave over the stove is a hazard for hubby and I having to get on a ladder to get items in and out of it. Yesterday I had an idea that this might work, so I ordered it. Stand arrived this morning, went together in less than 30 minutes and it fits perfectly where I needed it to. My unit is a microwave/convection oven so it\u2019s larger than most so it was very helpful to have the adjusting width. Now we can keep our toaster oven out also, instead of having to keep it in a cupboard. Can\u2019t wait to start baking my pumpkin pies and be able to get them into the oven without spillage.Only issue is that when I ordered the unit, I got notification that seller was no longer stocking this item and to choose another seller. I did (costlier) and imagine my surprise this morning when I got notice that the original one I wanted (this unit) would be delivered within an hour. The second one wouldn\u2019t be here until Wednesday. Luckily, I wa able to cancel the order as it hadn\u2019t yet shipped.",

The biggest complaint was that I had to straighten parts of it (as best as I could) from the damage done to it during shipping. Two of the end panels were significantly bowed in and one of the screws had no threads. Luckily it came with an extra screw. Also the small hooks that attach on the end may as well be trashed when you open the box. They are plastic and wont last long. Go get something better at you're local hardware store.",

However, the shelf unit inside was not damaged at all and it had all the necessary parts (and a few extra hooks and screws). It was quick and easy to assemble and will make the perfect shelf for my Cricut machines so that I can run more than one at the same time. I am glad that I didn't give up on the product based on my initial experience._______________________________The item arrived in a sealed box which had no damage or evidence of having been opened previously. However, there were pieces missing, specifically all the screws, that are essential to being able to assemble the shelves. It was also missing all of the levelling feet, the wrench and all of the hooks.Initially I hunted for screws locally that I would be able to use to assemble the product, but quickly realized that spending additional money on something that I had already paid a good price for was ridiculous. Therefore, I have opted to return the product and reorder it. Hopefully when the new one arrives it will have all the necessary pieces, otherwise it too will end up being returned.",
