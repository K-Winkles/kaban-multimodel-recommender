The stain has a nice color to it.There is still a \u201cfresh out of the wood shop\u201d smell to the boards, but that\u2019s to be expected.Pretty happy with this cutting board set.",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings on this board. I love that it\u2019s bamboo & very large. I did try to find one without the \u2018drain\u2019 at the edge because I have other boards for slicing wet meats & roasts. I wanted a completely flat board for sliding cut up items off the board. Not possible. So I bought one that would hold cut items & just put up with the groove.Didn\u2019t know what \u2018compartments\u2019 meant until I received the board. There was no rear view that I could find. So far I haven\u2019t found a use for them, but I figure I will at some point. It\u2019s pretty heavy with all the thicknesses & I think the seller tried to show that will several \u2018end\u2019 views of the board, but now I know. The board will probably last forever as it seems very well made & bamboo is a good product for cutting boards. All in all I\u2019m pretty satisfied & would be very happy if the drain channel was gone & the board was only half as thick as it is",

                "reviewText": "For $15 more, BUY THESE! I bought a cheaper bamboo set (with stand) a few months ago and they warp, they slide (must use towel under for safety) and now slightly crack with use (I hand-clean and dry).In THIS set, each board is exactly double the thickness of those in my cheaper set (.8 vs .4). Huge difference! These are also designed beautifully with under-grips and a pitched juice collection channel. They don't slide and due to the thickness (which is same as others I've had for 10 years), I know they won't warp.The stand is very attractive, but I wish it were a bit narrower, taking up less front-to-back space. It measures 5 3/4\" front-to-back and I feel under 5\" would be ideal for countertop usage.They're even boxed as a gift. These boards are fantastic! I couldn't be happier and plan to gift them to a friend or two as well.",
