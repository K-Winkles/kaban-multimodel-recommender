I've resisted buying stainless steel dish racks because I knew that those would start rusting after a short time but when I saw that these were aluminum, I decided to make the investment. I just had my kitchen remodeled and now with my large sink, this rack can sit on the bottom but I prefer to extend the handles and sit it on the counter top. It looks tiny but holds an impressive amount of items - this is designed very well and while it is pricey, well worth the cost!",
