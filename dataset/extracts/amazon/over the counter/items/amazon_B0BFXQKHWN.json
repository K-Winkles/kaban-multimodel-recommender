                "reviewText": "With an undermount sink and granite countertop, I hate having water collect around the faucet every time someone washes hands or does dishes - especially when you can't see it.THE GOOD: I can now see the water collect there and not worry it's going to leave hard water deposits there. When I rinse a cup, but not wash it yet, I like resting it on the mat. Same for a wet sponge, etc. It looks nice, I like it, and am keeping it for that reason. It looks nicer than the towel I kept permanently wrapped around the base of my kitchen faucet.THE NOT SO GOOD: Seriously, why the raised vertical bumplines and tiny drain spouts? Unless you flood the mat, it's flat...nothing \"drains\" off of it. The raised bumps make it harder to dry off with a towel - which you have to do. But those bump lines make it look a little nice than if they weren't there.",

The 3 stars are for an average, 4 * for 18\", 2 * for 24\". The 18\" is nicely designed and sloped well. The slope is on the bottom with fins that keep items on top level. The 24\" is not sloped at all and the drain tabs are much smaller, both of which causes more standing water. If they had taken the 24\" and just extended the ends, it would be at least a 4 or 5 *.",

(2) i'd like it to be just a wee bit thicker in the back, for better drainage; i put a plastic shim under the back, but it'd be cool to not have to deal with that. but those are minor issues, and overall i'm really pleased.",
