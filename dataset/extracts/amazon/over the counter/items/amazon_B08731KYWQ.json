Mine isn't overly curved, only just slightly at the edges, so the tray sits mostly flat on it and I'm content with it, but it's something I wished I had considered before purchasing as I would've maybe bought a smaller tray.Still, the product itself is great and does exactly what I need it for, and for that I'm thankful!",

They are substantial in weight, strong, and sturdy. Very well constructed.The wood of each I received are a little different in shade and markings. I didn't want to have two that looked exactly the same. It's easy to see that they are made with pride and care. They are a good size as well. I couldn't be happier with these.",
