                "reviewText": "Perfect when the kitchen trash can is too far away.My husband hates cooking with the trash can in the middle of the kitchen, or touching it when he has to take it out to scoop vegetable scraps into it. So he has developed a bad habit of piling the scraps on the counter instead of cleaning them right away. I hung this little can on the drawer below the counter where we cut vegetables. He likes it, and the counters aren't a disaster after he cooks anymore.The lid does get very dirty from stuff dropping down from the counter, and has to be cleaned often. I also don't like that we have to use yet another trash liner for this, although they're biodegradable I guess. Lastly, I find it difficult to change the liner, which does encourage us to re-use them until they stink. It's also easy to forget to empty it until the smell announces it's time.It opens and closes easily. I do feel some care is needed to avoid breaking it when changing the liner or cleaning. I don't think this would last in a kitchen with a large family. However, in our 2-person family it should be fine. It was more expensive than I wanted to pay for a trash can, but I reasoned that it was worth it to encourage a perpetually clean kitchen. It's easier to work around another person's bad habits than try to force them to change (and, Hay! He cooks for me. I can't complain.)",

                "reviewText": "We really like the size, construction, and material. The unit fits nicely behind the cabinet door, and doesn't take up too much room in the cupboard, but holds a week's worth of compost. We really like the function of the lid, it's a beautiful thing.The bad part is that the hook isn't long enough for the cupboard door to close when you suspend the container from it. It comes with an adhesive mount, which we used, and made it possible to mount the container low enough so the door could close. But... The adhesive failed after just two weeks.",

It does the job well, looks great, hangs easily and securely inside my cupboard over the door and the dual opening lid makes tipping food inside so easy. Really easy to clean too and the caddy bags fit neatly inside the bin under the enclosed rim. Please see attached video but excuse the filming as changing the bag is a little tricky with one hand! Two-handed is super simple and efficient.( I also have existing stuck-on hooks underneath the bin that I can\u2019t remove).",
