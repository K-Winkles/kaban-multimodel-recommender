                "reviewText": "When I first opened it I thought to send it back because it looked so small, even for my farm house sink. Duh! It's adjustable and collapsed for mailing. Like so many others, there were an insufficient number of screws but it worked out because I needed only four (there were five - there should always be an even number because of the even number of predrilled holes).Its hard to find an in-sink dish drainer with a level area for glasses. Most manufacturers center the rails for holding dishes. They put \"helpful\" glass holders along the edges but when it's a tight squeeze in a small sink, it is impossible to use the glass holders. We need a flat space in the front (as this one does) for glasses or off center dish rails which leaves room to one side for glasses.People complaining about the screw placement - get over it. Its in the pictures and the screws present no problem with putting dishes in the drainer.I've never had one with grips that hold onto the top of the sink as this one does. That's what pleases me the most. With the drainer elevated, the dish scrubber easily fits between the gaps of the rails to stay upright. I've struggled for years trying to fit the dish scrubber into a space to hold it upright so it doesn't tilt and drain the liquid soap inside.Had I needed to expand this thing to a larger size, I would've knocked off a star or two for the missing screw. On behalf of those who do need it expanded, this company really needs to look at their quality control. I don't recall any review mentioning that they have an overage of screws and it's suspicious that the drainers arrive missing screws. Dudes, charge an extra 50 cents and put the correct number of screws in the package instead of saving a few cents and disappointing your customers on something so minor.Since I just got it, I can't say anything about durability but since I really like it, I hope it lasts.",
