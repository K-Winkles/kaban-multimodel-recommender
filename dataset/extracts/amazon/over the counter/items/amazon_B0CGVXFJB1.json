                "reviewText": "I've been there, you've been there. Sink filters, under sink filters, endless pitchers. Brita, Pur, various generics. All make the water somewhat better, but do not make the water \"good\". ZeroWater does just that -- it makes the water \"good\"For ten years I've purchased ZeroWater products and I cannot accept anything else. It's one of those products -- once you start using it you realize how less than stellar everything else you've used before was in comparison. ZeroWater takes bad water and makes it taste better than bottledI live in an area with awful water and this house has awful old pipes. The tap water here tastes very similar to how a toilet tank smells - somewhat musty, somewhat off. It reads in the high 200s on the included meter. ZeroWater takes that down to 0 and removes the awful taste completely. If you put this in a bottle and told me it came from an industrial purifier I'd believe youEvery friend I've introduced to ZeroWater has been shocked by the difference coming from other brands. In my opinion Brita and Pur still leave lingering traces of nastiness even though they filter the harmful stuff out. You can make water safe without it tasting good -- ZeroWater makes it safe and good unlike other brandsThis large dispenser with two filters works wonders in solving how quickly my family goes through water -- not only does it filter faster than regular single filter dispensers, it manages to hold over three gallons. I can pour a gallon at a time up top and will have plenty of water without needing to sit and refill it constantly. It takes care of my only complaint -- the other previous ZeroWater products needed babysitting somewhat to fill to a usable level. If you have room, this is the one you wantI was concerned about filter lifespan and needing two filters until I realized each filter is effectively doing half as much work. I will gladly pay for a two pack of filters since this purifies so much faster than the others in this rangeHaving the pull lever instead of a button on the dispenser nozzle is very much appreciated as well. I had a smaller version that only had one filter and a push button that required you to stand there and hold it. This is so much easier for people who may have difficulties like arthritis or other issues. Pull the lever down, it fills. Push the lever back up, it stops. It's as easy as flipping a light switchI find myself drinking more water now that I have this dual filter tank. I keep a gallon pitcher on standby and can quickly fill this to capacity -- I really cannot give this dispenser enough praise. They really listened to their audience and fixed any complaints I would have had with previous models being slow or annoying to use due to needing to hold a buttonI'll borrow a quote from the old Packard car company, \"Ask the man who owns one\". I own one -- this is the one you want. Once you get used to the convenience there is no going back",

                "reviewText": "I live in a 1950's house with galvanized pipes. It's discouraging to put rust-tinged water into anything white, like this filter, but the end product is amazing! Filters out all the visible iron and the city chemicals. This water tastes fresh and delicious! I avoided drinking water at home because I hated the flavor. This filter makes you really want to drink more water. It's not super fast, but I think it's fast enough for one person easily. Love having the digital meter attached.One thing...I left on vacation and drained the filter so nothing grew while I was gone. Had to replace the filter when I got back because when it dried out it stopped sending water through. Fair enough. I'd rather that than icky stuff growing.",

It was super easy to put together (We have not figured out how to use the gauge) and we filled it all the way up day one.The water tastes great!

Also has a zero taste except for a clean water. Makes tap water clean to drink and saves me from having to carry cases of water up 3 flights of stairs.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Couple Major Design Flaws",
                "reviewText": "So for the most part, this water filter is stellar. The taste of the water takes some getting used to (I primarily drank tap water for years) and tastes almost alkaline. But once you get past that it's ok. Would be much nicer if it filtered faster as well. Takes a while between filling the top and it filtering the water before you can refill the top.So the two major design flaws:When you fill this, YOU NEED IT TO CREATE A VACUUM IN THE PITCHER. If you don't, it will stop filtering correctly. Easiest way to do this is to fill up the top tray, let it filter, then immediately fill the tray again and lift the top off and rotate it so that the air can get out. From there when the top tray is almost done filtering rotate it back and fill the tray all the way up again. DO NOT LET THE TOP TRAY EMPTY AFTER THIS POINT, if you do it'll stop filtering until you repeat the process. This could be fixed by creating a vent at the top that allows air to leave the tank (air cannot be compressed which is what causes the water to stop filtering).Second flaw, the TDS sensor attaches to the spout but there are two contacts that go through the spout and are supposed to test it as it dispenses. The issue with this is that the contacts (at least on mine) do absolutely nothing. This causes the TDS sensor to not function when mounted to it. Each time I have wanted to check the water I have had to remove the TDS sensor and check manually. This could be improved by completely forgoing the probes and just design it so that the TDS sensor is incorporated into the tank so that it can be checked at all times.",

                "reviewText": "I was attracted to the Zero Water versus the other popular filter system due to the complete removal of 'Forever Chemicals'. Easy to fill and the best part is the gauge to test the water each time. Just a matter of pressing the button. When I tested my bottled water it was very high in solids measured. So surprised. That is why I bought in the first place. My tap water tested better. Although my cities' water is fairly good, the taste of it with Zero Water is so much better.",
