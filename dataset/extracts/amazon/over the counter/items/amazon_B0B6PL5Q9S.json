It's very sturdy, frees up counter space, keeps everything organized and at your convenience. Overall, very satisfied. The only disappointment being the knife holder only works for large knives. Smaller ones and table knives flop sideways. A second or larger utensil holder would be much better. There was no information included as to how to order additional accessories.",

                "reviewText": "We have a larger double sink, but one side has a basket and drying rack and is always full of hand washed items. We wanted something more and found this.Assembly was pretty basic and easy, took maybe 15 minutes.I extended it further than the edge of the sink to allow for space to set hand soap and dish soap in between the sink and the side frame of this storage. This also allowed me position the upper baskets away from our tall faucet.Just finished cooking 4 pies for Thanksgiving and this allowed for us to hand wash and store all sorts of baking cups, sheets, bowls, spoons, mixing attachments etc. It worked perfectly and I am extremely happy with it.It seems sturdy enough to last a long time as well. I'd buy again!",
