                "reviewText": "The racks are sturdy but I found them frustrating for my purposes. The slots are wide enough for single sheet pans, cookie sheets and cutting boards, but when removing a sheet pan, for instance, the pan next to it gets in the way. There just isn\u2019t enough room for my hand to reach for a pan without bumping into the pan next to it. Also, it didn\u2019t feel secure as a freestanding rack. The whole thing tends to move when pulling out a pan. Since I am using wire shelving for storing my pans, I didn\u2019t have a good way to secure the rack.So I decided to try an expandable rack that allows adjustment of the slots. I already had https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TQF57WS?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details for storing fry and saute pans and knew it was sturdy and versatile, so I ordered another one for my sheet pans, cutting boards, cooling racks, pizza pans, etc. It turned out to be perfect for my needs and easily holds everything. I still think this product is fine and works ok, especially if all you need are narrow slots, but the heavy duty expandable rack is so much better that, if you have the space for it, I would recommend it over this product.",

I set this organizer up and it holds the cutting boards sit perfectly in the dividers and they don't fall over. Very happy with it! \ud83d\ude0a",
