                "reviewText": "I was looking for a way to neatly store V60 filters to reduce counter clutter and keep the filters dust-free. This plastic filter holder fit the bill. Empty or completely full of filters, you can use one hand to open the front door and the holder does not tip over (like some others) and does not require applying adhesives to the unit to keep it from tipping (like some others). It is stated to hold 100 filters but I put 100 V60-02 filters in the box and there was still room for some more. So 100 filters is not a tight fit and you will be able to easily remove one filter if you load it up with 100 filters. I can easily store V60-01 and V60-02 filters together in this box. I don't have any V60-03 filters to try at the moment. The box is light weight but I have had no issues so far.",
