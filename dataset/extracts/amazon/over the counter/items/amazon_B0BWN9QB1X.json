                "reviewText": "Pros: Very easy to assemble. Looked at the picture and could figure it out. Beautiful in appearance and very sturdy. Already had gone through two others (one stainless that rusted) and another that just never went together well. Cheaply made. Lesson learned. I did not mount it to the wall as it would have to be drilled in concrete (basement bathroom), but the adjustable feet were easy to maneuver and it isn't going anywhere.Con: Yes, there is only one con. The shelves are hinged in the middle. The hinges for each shelf are on the underside of the shelf. If the top one could have been all one piece, the hinges would not be visible. Not sure why they cannot be one solid piece for all three but maybe shipping was a factor.",

                "reviewText": "This over the toilet shelving unit is nice and good looking. The assembly was easy and everything went together well. I agree with one of the other comments made by a purchaser. The shelves are foldable so there is a visible hinge when you open and attach the shelves to the unit. Unfortunatley, I think this minor flaw detracts from the beauty of the shelves. It probably would be better to have the shelves made to regular length. ( I will probably buy some nice wood and do a hack to change out the hinges.) We also secured the shelving unit to the wall with the provided attachments. This made the unit much more sturdy. We are very pleased and love our shelving unit and are keeping it.",

                "reviewText": "Bathroom storage is a premium we generally don't have (main bathroom is currently tiny). We were looking for an over the toilet shelf to add some much-needed space to accommodate just that, but they were either extremely pricey or looked to be cheaply made (every metal shelf I've ever had has been a rickety mess). I decided to take a chance on the AmazerBath Over The Toilet Bamboo Storage Shelf, and it was honestly a great choice. It's much more stable than the metal shelves I've had in the past, but the price is comparable (actually cheaper). The screw-in installation is easy, but make sure you start at the bottom (being the smart guy that I am, I didn't bother to read the instructions and started at the top, only to have to completely disassemble it to restart from the bottom...don't be like me, read the instructions). The shelves have a hinged design where they fold open to form the shelf. I was a bit worried that might result in a weaker or unstable product, but it's had no problems holding up towels, bins with random toiletries and heavy bottles of shampoo and condition. The bamboo itself is pretty lightweight, but the shelf is quite stable and a bit more water resistant because of it. I like the product, and will be getting a second for our other bathroom.",

It is just useful and snapped together easily, with a hinge to fold on each shelf. Shelves are wide and deep enough to place folded bath towels easily, the legs are perfectly spaced to create a sturdy stance. (This is a bit expensive for a utility need but serves so well I now have 3 of them!) Highly recommended based on 2-4 weeks of use.A delay in shipment on one of the items was fairly short, and a friend saw this in my place and ordered one for herself.",
