                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with this dish rack. It's pretty well made for a \"flat-box\" item. It's better made than a lot of things you'd get at IKEA. Easy to put together and looks nice in my little kitchen. Frees up so much counter space too.Mine came well packed, without scratches or anything bent. All the hardware was labeled and easy to put together. Didn't really need the instructions. It was intuitive. The little suction cups that are on the bottom of the stand are cheap little things that will not seal to a clean, flat surface, but the rack itself is built pretty stable so you aren't relying on those little things anyway. Honestly, they are probably more useful in keeping the rack slightly elevated so that water doesn't get trapped between the metal of the rack and your countertop. If you look at them in that light, they are perfectly designed. I would recommend this rack to anyone who is considering getting one of this style. I looked at several that would fit my space and I'm not disappointed that I chose this one.Merrybox also reached out to me via email the day my package was delivered to make sure I had no trouble with my product. I appreciate a company that is proactive in its' customer support. I would buy from this company again.",

                "reviewText": "I have a galley kitchen. As the cook in the house, I'm always complaining - actually, more than that at times -about the lack of counter space. I've installed spice racks and shelves, but I thought that there was nothing else I could do except move until I saw this product. This product has given me some counter space from dumping my dish rack! I watched the video for this product. The guy is fast. He puts it together in no time on a counter. However, there are two problems with that video: (1) Chances are, you won't put it together that fast, and if you try to, you'll probably make a mistake. (2) There's no sink, and they don't put it over a sink. My advice that I learned the hard way is to always lay out and confirm your parts, and this manufacturer is smart enough to include extras, was when they don't, you'll invariably drop one or more and then won't find it for a few years, by which time you're wondering what it went to/came from. The other suggestions: take your time and, for this product, give yourself plenty of floor (or counter, but I don't have any of that, remember?) space. Here's the big suggestion: only put together the frame: the two sides and the back. Ideally, the holes for the snaps face away from you, but also don't snap them all in, as you'll probably be adjusting the width. The suction cups for this - and they provided extras - worked the best of any I've ever had. As for why only assemble the frame first, that's because your sink may have obstacles in the way of where the pics for this product intended them to go and it's also much, much easier to adjust the width of this product without all of the other paraphernalia attached. My sink's obstacles: I already had a sponge holder that I bought here at Amazon, and it happened to be the same color, rare luck. I had to move this product's sponge holder to the other side, the aforementioned knife holder to the side sink. I had a specialized faucet and a back wall, so I had to shimmy this product in. This is where you might have to return the product.There was no picture with or on the packaging, so I had to go back to this Amazon page to see it with \"stuff\" in it! I couldn't figure out what the knife holder was! I still don't know if I'll use it, as the knives that I use don't have huge handles. You may also find that you use parts of this for different purposes: for instance, we rarely use goblets, but that part holds other things, such as measuring cups and dish towels, well. I'm still experimenting with the various hooks. Decisions, decisions.Altogether, if you could use more counter space, this will do the job. It is set back enough from the front of your sink(s) so as to not interfere very much, though as you can see from my picture, it does not - unfortunately - prevent the sinks from filling up. Now if they only had a product that did that...",

                "reviewText": "We have a small kitchen and counter space is of a premium. So not having space on the sides of our sink, we always had a dish rack in the one side of the sink. This over the sink drying rack has been a great addition to our kitchen. It gave us back our sink and looks good too. The rack itself matches all our appliances which are black and our accent pieces in our kitchen which are wrought iron decor. It's very easy to assemble (I'm 60+) I did it alone. You can re-arrange the baskets to your liking. the cup rack can go on either side of the baskets. I have since moved mine to the middle, so it drains into the sink and not on the counter. there are 6 hangers for your utensils to hang anywhere you like. It is also adjustable and very sturdy. This unit is one of the best purchases I have made. I've recommended it to several of my friends. If you're questioning whether or not to buy this unit.....BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.CDL Tavares FL",
