So I was like well, I like them so let me get another set for the new space I was looking to make levels on.Something was defective with this order, or they just don't make them good quality any more. I'm not sure. But I am returning them for sure. The bolts were too big!!!! So you couldn't screw them together. Very defective. Hopefully they're not all like that and maybe I just got a bad one.I really do like them though. The other two sets I've had for 5+ years now and they have seen three states/kitchens. Super helpful when needing/wanting to make levels in a cabinet/shelf.Snippet from original review:They're sturdy, good size for what I need. They work, they make sense. The price is good! If you're looking to make levels in any cabinet I would say grab these ones.",
