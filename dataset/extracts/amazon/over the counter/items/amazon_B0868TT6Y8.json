                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the over-sink drying rack, which has been a game-changer in my kitchen. The design is sleek and minimalistic, which I love. It fits perfectly over my sink and saves so much counter space. The rack is sturdy, and I use it to hold pots and pans that I wash by hand. The water drains directly into the sink, which makes cleanup a breeze. I also appreciate the added bonus of the dish rack being rust-resistant and covered with silicon. Because it is covered in silicon, it can handle very hot pots, pans, and dishes right from the oven. I highly recommend the over-sink drying rack to anyone who wants to streamline their dishwashing process and save space in their kitchen. It has definitely made my life easier.",
