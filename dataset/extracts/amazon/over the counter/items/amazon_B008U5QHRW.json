However, I will no longer be buying it from Amazon, as they have raised the price significantly since I 1st purchased it. When I say significantly, I mean it has doubled in price. I can now buy it locally much cheaper than I can get it from Amazon. I enjoy the convenience of Amazon, but not to the point where I will pay double for an item. The pain relief it brings is worth the price, so if you can't find it cheaper locally, I would recommend the product. I know prices go up, but not double in a short amount of time.",
