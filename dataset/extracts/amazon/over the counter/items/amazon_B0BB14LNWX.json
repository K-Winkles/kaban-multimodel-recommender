More or less a miniature roll up ladder, laid on its side and positioned over your sink. The hollow slats make the rack super like and the silicon sides grip counters well.More often than not I leave mine in place folded in half; I roll it all the way occasionally (still leaving it in place at the edge of the sink) and, of course, extend it fully for washing and drying dishes and fruit. It\u2019s a simple item and pretty much as advertised on the product page, so I\u2019ll forgo a detailed description of slats and silicon strips.This enables my bachelor habits; use \u2013 rinse \u2013 air dry the same 4 implements until company compels me to do otherwise.All that said, value-wise \u2013 I balk at the price a little. I definitely like it, but not sure I\u2019d shell out full price.",

The flatness of the tubes used are perfect for setting a flat glass or cup on. The round tubes only give you a small spot and glasses and cups can tip over. This one works great.Just measure your sink area and purchase the one that best fits your area. Roll it on and enjoy. When you need to use the sink underneath, just roll it to the side. DYNAMITE!Try it, if you don't like it, return it....Amazon policy for returned items is terrific! Buy with confidence!",

                "reviewText": "I got the 17X17 version. Sometimes I need extra space for drying dishes when I've been putting off doing them and my dish rack can't handle the backup. I use it on top of my wash basin. What I like about it:- Seems decent quality. Very lightweight. The bars are square so that probably adds some rigidity strength to them.- Rolls up very nicely. I use a random rubberband that came with some brocolli to tie it up. I don't really need it but it's nice to keep it from unraveling when I move it around. Could imagine it coming in really handy in an RV or while camping.- I'm glad that the material at the edges that holds the whole thing together is silicone so it doesn't have any rough edges.Seems a bit pricy but is a lot more reasonable with the current coupon code that basically gives you 33% off.",
