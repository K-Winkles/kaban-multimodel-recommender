                "reviewText": "My mountain cabin has a rustic kitchen and no dishwasher. My typical plastic dish rack was gross and didn\u2019t hold much. On Thanksgiving I put this one to the test. It did well. Granted it didn\u2019t hold the platters and pans etc but I can see for a small crowd it will do nicely. It looks clean which I like as well as the drainer spout feature. I did find it a little difficult to attach the top rack until I took a photo and zoomed it up. Hook goes under the bottom of rack over in the middle through to the top rack with all hooks pointing out. For attaching the top rack, hold your breath, hold one side then kind of force it into place on top. Once in it\u2019s very secure. I think it will work well for me.",

The cup holder is sturdy, it has a tray underneath and a drying mat, all for a good price. I'm happy with this purchase.",

Good design, even has a place to put a cutting board where it drips into the sink. The biggest problem is that the legs are only a couple of millimeters long, so if you have even a low lip around your sink, you'll have to block the rack up in order for it to drain to the sink. We have it perched on a couple of wooden blocks.",

After reading tons of reviews on several different racks I ended up chosing this rack. I really like the style, the knife compartment part, & the way it strains the water. So far it's been great. Enough for my dishes and ended up being the perfect size. Of course, after having it for several months, the water marks are there, but that happens to all racks. I would definitely recommend this rack. I will purchase again, when I need to replace.",

                "reviewText": "Recieved the product very fast after purchasing. Arrived in excellent condition. It took a little time & patience to assemble. Instructions weren't the worst I've seen, but not exactly straight forward with every step. Works great so far & feels sturdy, even with having 2 levels. Overall a little more compact than I was expecting (and much more than the last drying rack I had) but gers the job done, just won't be able to hold as many items.I deducted 2 stars because - 1. The water drain spout is not NEARLY as long as they make it look in the photos. I purchased the two tier drying rack and no matter what direction I rotate the spout, it barely reaches the end of each edge. This means you have to put the edge of the rack right up against the edge of your sink, unless you'd like to have to wipe down your counter every single time. I strongly dislike this short spout and didn't appreciate that inaccurate advertisement.2. My dish rack did not come with the cup holder. Definitely disappointed with that.All-in-all, it's just okay. It'll do the job for now, but for the price, I expect better. Not something I would repurchase.",
