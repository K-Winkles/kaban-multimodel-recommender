I mean, I can put cups there but they end up dripping dry onto the countertop or floor and not the tray it has under it since it's too narrow.The only other con I have is, how to clean under the drip tray. I can't figure out if that comes off without feeling like I'm going to break it.Overall, it's great, I love that silverware holder, it drips perfectly into the main part and holds plenty.If I can't figure out how to clean under the main drip tray, then I might have to get a different one next time.",

I chose this because I can put my 16\" pizza pan, or a large cutting board, vertically on the side drainer. The flatware drainer is a bit small but I only use it for cutting utensils (steel knives & peelers) that shouldn't go in the dishwasher. We are very happy with this product.",

                "reviewText": "This rack looks nice, fits well in our kitchen, and seems fairly sturdy. However, there are some design flaws that need to be worked around to make this functional. The cup rack causes glasses to be angled away from the tray, so they drain onto the counter. The plastic tray under the cup rack doesn\u2019t fit well into the metal frame. This is a cosmetic problem, not a functional one. Lastly, the silverware rack tips away from the base, so water can\u2019t drain out. I fixed this by putting a paper clip against the back of the rack on the base, but of course, I shouldn\u2019t have to be modifying a new rack to make it work.",
