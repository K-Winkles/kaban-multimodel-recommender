                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Assembly Tips and Vertical Space Recovered",
                "reviewText": "***** ASSEMBLY TIPSSome reviewers stated they had issues with the pre-drilled pilot holes, wobbly legs and the screws themselves. I had none of these issues with my order.Others mentioned there is not much clearance to place a screw driver between the top of the shelf and the bottom of the leg. This is true. There is no cheapie short screwdriver included such as may be the case with other products. You will have about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 inches to work with. It is easier to use a stubby or offset screwdriver. A number 2 phillips screwdriver tip works best. See photos #3 and #5. Photo #3 is the shorter leg. Photo #5 is an optional offset screwdriver.To make the screws easier to install, before attaching the legs screw in the screws about three quarters of the way into the shelf and then remove the screws. When attaching the legs only screw in enough to make the legs secure.The pilot holes on my shelves did not line up exactly center to center, but the entire holes were visible. The legs attached without issue.***** OTHER DIMENSIONSIf you have a tight fit for some objects here are some dimensions not shown in the Amazon product page:The inside dimension between the legs on both shelves is about 10.0 inches (+/- 1/16 inch). See photo #4.The inside dimension from the bottom of the leg to the bottom of the taller shelf is about 5-5/8 inches (+/- 1/16 inch). See photo #6.The inside dimension from the bottom of the leg to the bottom of the shorter shelf is about 4-15/16 inches (+/- 1/16 inch). See photo #7.***** VERTICAL SPACE RECOVEREDI have a boat of spice containers in a kitchen cabinet resulting in wasted vertical space. These shelves solved a lot of my problem. I placed a turntable/Lazy Susan under each shelf. I settled on a Copco 9 inch diameter turntable. There were some other brands available in ten inch, but that may have rubbed on the shelf legs. See photo #8.***** OVERALL THOUGHTSThe shelves look good in just about any place you will use them. The quality is decent. The shelf dimensions are clearly given on the Amazon product page so there should be no surprises such as they are too small, too short, etc.***** MINOR ANNOYANCESEach shelf has paper labels attached to bottom of the shelf. Some paper and glue residue may be left on the shelf when the label is removed. See photo #9. There are labels that can be easily removed from wood, but this type was not used.I wont let packaging affect my overall review. It's worth mentioning. My order survived shipping thru delivery. Some reviewers complained about the shelf arrived broken. The shelves are packed in a box with no inside protection such as styrofoam. See photo #1. My box arrived in a gray shipping plastic bag.",

                "reviewText": "Love this product for my cabinets!However, the screws are very hard to tighten into the wood with the Allen screwdriver it comes with. I highly reccomend using your own screwdriver and using small WASHERS (not included with the cabinet stands) (see photo) to elevate the hard to tighten screws. Without the washers, the stand may be very wobbly and difficult to tighten all the way down.The metal washers made installation so much easier and made the product even sturdier.",

I was able to fit them into our pantry without any issue, and have been using them to store my cups on top of each other. This shelf divider is very easy to assemble (everything you need is included with the assembly), the measurements for it are accurate (since I was looking for something to fit snuggly), and it is sturdy.",
