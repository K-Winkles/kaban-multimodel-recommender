                "reviewText": "I really like the expandability of this drainer. I love that it's fairly sturdy and I can take it apart to clean it pretty easily. The main drawbacks are 1. It's easy for the silverware holder to come loose and suddenly plummet to the floor/counter. We've had that happen more than once. It's meant to be removable, and it just sort of perches on the top crossbar. It has to be set in one particular spot so its bottom can be braced against something. 2. The metal loops sticking up on the sides of the main part seem like a natural spot to hang cups and glasses, but they are too short. No regular cups or glasses stay; they have to be set solidly on the rack or on the extension. Aside from these, it's a great dish drainer. I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried several styles of dish racks and none were ever right. They took up too much room on my counter, and the fabric pads eventually got some mold on them since it takes awhile for them to dry.This has been the BEST dish rack that I\u2019ve found! I love that it is expandable when needed, and has a small footprint when it\u2019s not expanded.The drain can be positioned in different directions, runs the water off into my sink perfectly *as long as you don\u2019t pull the trough out to its maximum*. Like another reviewer, I pulled it out to its maximum and it leaked under the rack. I pushed it in about a 1/4-1/2 inch and no leak and it still reaches my sink just fine.The rack is strong enough to hold my enameled cast iron pots and pans, so it\u2019s strong.I never knew I could like a dish rack so much, but it has solved some frustrations I\u2019ve had with other racks and I have more counter space.",

Also the water drainage is poor. There's always a puddle of water under my dish rack and I know it's coming from the dish rack. Not even sure how to clean that little drainer thingy (it's not easy to remove and I don't want to try to remove it and end up breaking it)",

There is a bottom piece that turns so the water makes it back into the kitchen sink, the dishes dry much faster, the bottom extends out for extra drying space, and there is also a silverware holder. The only downside is you can\u2019t put too much in the silverware holder or it falls over. This comes pre-assembled and you can move the silverware holder to it fits on your sink.Overall I recommend. Very good quality.",
