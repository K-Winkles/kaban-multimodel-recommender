                "reviewText": "I ordered 4 stools. They arrived in 3 days! They were carefully packaged and easy to assemble (one person can do it). The base is sturdy, floor protectors are already installed and level. Excellent quality seat. Cane is beautiful with slight variations of color which make them look expensive against the solid wood back. Height is as described. When the stools are pushed all the way forward, the fabric seat touches the island instead of the legs, so it will never scratch! I figured I'd only need 3 stools based on counter length calculations, but the package of 4 wasn't much more. Once assembled, I actually like having 4 since the stools are narrow! Another bonus: my dog is blind, so the simple c-shape base prevents injury. We love them!",

                "reviewText": "I like these barstools a lot and I will be keeping them because they are perfect for small spaces. They have clean simple lines that keep a space from feeling cluttered. They are super cute and the rattan is real, not plastic imitation. The seat isn\u2019t very plush, but it doesn\u2019t hurt either- which is hard to come by when you have chronic back pain. I give four stars because although I feel that the quality is passable on these chairs, the cantilever nature of them have a natural sort of \u2018give\u2019. So they kind of rock a little bit like an ikea poang if you\u2019ve ever sat in one of those. I personally like it now that I\u2019m used to it and confident I\u2019m not going to fall or break the chair. But I was admittedly hoping for sturdier construction. And despite all my measurements they are still slightly smaller than expected. All that being said, they are cute, functional, comfortable, and lightweight. I\u2019m happy with my purchase.",
