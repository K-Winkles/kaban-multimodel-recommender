Needed additional counter space, and I do like that you can extend out for additional dish drying, and it extends across the sink to drain water.It's sturdy for holding larger plates, but IMHO, it's not an \"overnight dish drainer\" or made to drain larger dishes or pots/pans, due to its smaller size. I normally have a saucer and a cup sitting on the rack daily, and that's it.",
