                "reviewText": "Purchased the 20.8 in x 14.2 in for my Blanco Silgranit single bowl kitchen sink and I just love it! Sink outer dimensions are 33 in x 22 in. This sink rack fits perfectly. (Make sure to measure your sink and allow for at least 1 inch to rest on front and back of sink for adequate support.) It is great for prepping/drying fruits, veggies, etc. Also great for drying dishes, pots and pans. This rack expands the use of my sink and counter area for food prep or clean up. Can be folded up to reduce space and allow use of more sink bowl space but still have the use of the rack. Cleans very easily with soap and dish brush. Have not washed in DW yet but will try this soon. Only three sides rest on sink but it is still strong enough to support a cast iron skillet. I\u2019m very picky about kitchen gadgets and am very pleased with the quality of this rack. No rust after three months of heavy use. No warping. This is the next best thing to a workstation sink! (If you\u2019re not familiar with these, look them up - very cool!)",

Easily rolls up and placed under counter or in a drawer, perfect for me. It's stainless steel so no rust, discoloring, or moldy surfaces, washes/wipes off easily. Big enough for large frying pans, just right for laying plates, bowls etc. silverware lays out just fine. It has rubber ends so it doesn't scratch my granite counter top. Yes, after you take dishes off of it you should wipe water off counter, but it's the same for those other dish racks. I love this stainless steel flat dish strainer/rack.",

You might have one or two dishes left over from coffee or whatever. You don't have to pull the dish rack back out. You can just wash those little bitty dishes and dry them over the sink instead of on the counter.On a paper towel for a kitchen towel. When i'm not using it it won't take up much room at all.",

I don't make many dishes and this is perfect for a plate, bowl, maybe a small sauce pan, and a couple cups.I also use it to water my plants and let them drain into the sink. It easily holds everything I've put on it - from 3 gallon jugs to heavy pots and pans. It's easy to clean and very light.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a used one from Amazon Warehouse. It arrived missing the silicone mat and with water stains from prior use on the aluminum mat. So I returned it. The company's customer service contacted me via email and offered to send me another one at no charge. I assumed that some dishonest customer had returned the item in this condition, and Amazon hadn't caught the issues when restocking. Not the fault of the company distributing the item through Amazon but they took ownership anyway and reached out. Pretty awesome, esp given the serious decline in customer service everywhere these days. I took them up on their offer and a new one arrived in a few days. So 2 thumbs up for service.As far as the mat goes, we love it. It's a great way to air dry a few things, esp glasses whose insides don't dry on a traditional fabric mat on the counter. The silicone edges of the mat cling to the countertop and don't slip. It can roll up and sit next to the sink when not in use, but we've gotten in the habit of folding it in half and leaving it on the sink all the time. The bars are then spaced closer together so we can hang kitchen knives through them to air dry. The stainless steel rods do show water spots so you have to clean it with soap and water every now and then to keep it looking good. The silicone mat allows us to wash berries and drain them all in one step over the sink.Great kitchen gadget!",
