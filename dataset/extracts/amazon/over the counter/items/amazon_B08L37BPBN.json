Mounting was super easy (I used the adhesive mount) and the only drawback (if there is one) is that you are not supposed to use the towel holder for at least 24 hours after adhesive mounting. But it has been up now for nearly 2 weeks and seems sturdy, looks great, and I LOVE it!! It also comes with additional adhesive strips for the future, just in case!",

                "reviewText": "I got this product to save space on my kitchen counter. This product met my requirements very well and is made of high-quality materials. The adhesive is very strong so be careful and plan your sticking by imagining a full-size paper towel roll to leave enough space between the wall and the holder (and not a half-empty one). Also, use the adhesive option if you do not plan to ever remove the holder once it is stuck to the underside of the cabinet as it doesn't look like it will ever come off. If you plan to move and take this holder with you, then use the screw option. Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend this to anyone considering an under-the-cabinet paper towel holder!",

It\u2019s lightweight and will stick to just about anywhere. I love mine and have mine placed under some cabinets (hanging horizontally). My only issue is that since it\u2019s very lightweight, it\u2019s not quite as sturdy as I\u2019m hoping it would be. Sometimes i try to pull a paper towel quickly and feel the bar is going to come off the cabinet. It hasn\u2019t yet but it feels like it will - not sure how long it will last until I need to use another Mount sticker to put it up again.",

It also looks nice and matches the hardware on my cabinets.",

The bottom of my cabinet was way too thin to screw into without breaking through the top and having a screw point sticking out. I ended up getting a 1/4\" piece of plywood cut to about the same size as the mounting plate and glued that to the underside of my cabinet. Then screwed the towel holder into that. It has been fine since. It is not the must sturdy still, but serves its purpose just fine",
