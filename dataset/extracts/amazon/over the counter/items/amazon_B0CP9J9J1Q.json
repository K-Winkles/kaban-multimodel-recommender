Note: The memory function only works when the light is powered, if you unplug it, the setting will back to default.Easy to InstallNo need to hire anyone to install the lights, just use the screw or 3M stickers, you can mount the LED counter lights anywhere you need.Are you tired of not having light to brighten your keyboard up at night without the ceiling light on?If you have a standup desk and it is hard to see the keyboard. This LED light bar works out perfectly. You just mount it above the keyboard on a sliding keyboard shelf under the desktop and it works out great. You can have it plug into your docking station so when you turn off your computer the light goes off as well. Great notebook computer keyboard downlight. If your work/study bench is always in shadow when you work/study in this spot and bothers your eyes?The desk light bar lit the whole area perfectly. It is much superior to fluorescent lighting and is dimmable so that the lighting can be adjusted to its most attractive setting. The cabinet light is perfect for meeting your different needs during homeschooling or working. The plug-in LED lighting will be much better for video calls, lectures, and reading. Could be used as a portable light with a laptop because of the USB power connection.",

                "reviewText": "There's one place in my kitchen where there's always inadequate light, regardless the time of day or how many lights are on.I installed this under the cabinet and the problem is solved. It's very bright and comes with a more than enough cord to reach the nearest outlet (I ran the excess cord back and forth under the cabinet to keep it out of sight).I was skeptical when it arrived because it's so tiny but it works great.I gave it 4 stars because the on/off button is hyper sensitive.I'd buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "2nd order of Under counter \"kitchen\" lights, and we Love them!The double sided tape holds everything securely, the included clips are low profile and work great to tuck and hide the wires, and the plug in links of wires, switches and lights are a simple install.I bought 9 kits, and I installed 6 in our living room built-ins as well as 3 under my kitchen cabinets.I did give a 4 out of 5 star rating, simply because of an issue with the on/off/dimmer when used in conjunction with a timer or smart plug: The description says \"The lights will automatically come back on to the brightness level you last had it at.\" and that is misleading; if you plug into a timer or wifi outlet, they will not turn on after power is cut; you have to go to each light kit and push the button on the on/off/dimmer. This didn't work for us, since we installed 6 sets in the living room, and we were not about to get up and feel around for 6 buttons in 6 different places every night. My work-around was to leave the on/off/dimmer links out of my living room setup. We plugged the power sources into my smart plugs, skipped the on/off/ dimmer and went from there directly to the first light. Now I can turn all of my built-ins lights on/off through a smart plug group on an app! But we did give up the ability to dim in doing so. My wife and I like the level of brightness in my built-ins on each side of the fireplace, and it doesn't appear to be distracting while watching television. But if anyone ever thinks it is, we can simply turn the lights off through the smart plug phone app. It would have been nice had the dimmers come on after the power was cut, but not a deal breaker.The cool white lights make our shelves \"pop\" and looks really clean! My wife said everything is beautiful!I did install the on/off/dimmer links on the 3 kits (containing 9 lights) I used in the kitchen. We needed to be able to just reach over and flick them on and off when preparing meals. I installed two lights from a kit on the coffee bar section, 5 lights on the main section, and 2 lights at the adjacent office nook... Utilized 3 kits, using all 9 lights, in the configuration I wanted, and everything worked Perfectly!And the level of brightness is perfect for use under the kitchen cabinets as well as in the office nook!I just wish they offered the ability to order extra segments of different lengths of wire if needed. A few of the wire links were stretched to the max!!!Highly recommended!",
