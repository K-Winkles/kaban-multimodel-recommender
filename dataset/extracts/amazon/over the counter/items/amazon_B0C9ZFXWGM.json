                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this 3 tier drying rack from LIVOD! It has been life changing!! It freed up my 2nd kitchen sink as my other drying rack was always in there. It's great having two sinks clean and clear of dishes during the day. It is very sturdy, even the top rack holds my big cast iron skillet without wobbling at all! There is a spot for all my dishes and odd shaped items with no issue! I have had it for a few months now and still no rust. This rack is made from quality materials. I looked at other, cheaper versions, but ultimately decided to pay a bit more for better quality and stability as life is too short for cheap junk! I am so glad I did, as this rack is definitely worth it. I would recommend this specific dish rack to my family and friends looking to purchase a similar item. Thanks LIVOD for going above and beyond with your products and their amazing quality!!",

They are absolute junk. Go to the hardware store and buy some nice screws and nuts. For $130, this absolutely irks me. The shelf holes do not line up in the front. I ended up using a clamp to spread the shelves apart far enough to get the two front bolts in both shelves. They were off by at least 1/4 inch. I do not notice the shelves being out of level with the eye test.",

Accessing the location to tighten the screws/nuts is a challenge.Some of the screws are different sizes but the instructions lump them all in together.Overall, this isn\u2019t worth it even with the lightning deal discount.
