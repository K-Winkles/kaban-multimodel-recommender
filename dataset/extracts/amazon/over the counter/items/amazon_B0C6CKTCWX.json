But I have a double sink so I just put on end on the sink rim and the other on the split between the two sinks. I thought this is good because then it is also at an angle so the water will drain off it better. I used it for a few dishes, it is on the small side so it won't fit a ton of dishes, when I put the dishes away the next morning it was still wet and then later in the afternoon it was still wet. Even at an angle the water just sat on it. I guess it just didn't work for me.",

I ordered this drying mat and I really just set the part with the metal bars on top of the silicon mat. This makes it possible to get dishes dry and it is just more convenient so that when I don't want anything in that space I roll it back up and put it under the sink. I think that is the beauty of this product it's so versatile. The parts are easy to clean and can just be wiped down if needed.",
