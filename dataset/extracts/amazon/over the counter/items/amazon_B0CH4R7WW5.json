                "reviewText": "* Addendum: Added under counter lights which helped a lot also I'm adding rubber edge protector, like the kind you put on car door edges, to the rims of all the baskets. I grew a little concerned for my ceramic dishes when putting them in the strainer that they may fall over and chip or break on the hard metal edges of the baskets. Not a big deal and I am still loving this strainer...Really like this product though it has some drawbacks. I like all you get for the money though it would be nice if they offered you the ability to buy some of the parts separately. There is room on this rack for more of the components such as I would like another cutlery holder, hooks, cup holder & storage basket. It does have some issues such as it is quite tall even at it's lowest configuration for those of you that are vertically challenged you may want to take this into consideration. Also if you have cabinets on either side of your sink, I put mine up against the cabinets on one side to stabilize it more, make sure you have room. Also if you have an overhead light this may block your light to the sink when it's full of dishes (I'm adding undercounter lights to combat this which I wanted to add anyways). It's nicely adjustable so if you have a window over your sink it can be set up to block as little of it as possible also having your dishes in front of the window allows natural UV light to help sterilize them (an added bonus). This rack could also be more robust, the bars are a little on the thin side, it does stabilize pretty well once completely assembled. I did hear a loud crack from it the first time I used it (it wasn't overloaded either since I didn't have many dishes to wash and just wanted to try it out). I checked all the welds and they seem to be intact so I'm guessing it was just a screwed connection \"settling in\". I would be nice if the bars were a little bigger with two screws on each end. If you want a good laugh look closely at the pictures of this product some of the hooks seem to be magically floating in the air and the utensils are hanging from the top of the hooks not the bottom. Just a poor morphing job on the pics they faked which is quite common these days. They do show the cutlery holder on the left side with it's knife holder in the back which is not possible with the one I received, not a big deal, either have the knives in the front or put it on the right side which is what I did. There are many possible configuration options with this so find the one that works for you. I do like this product a lot and would buy it again. It cleared up a lot of counter space in my kitchen and made good use of unused space. Anything that helps clean up and organize my kitchen better is alright with me and this rack does a bang up job. Gave it 4 stars which is my highest rating, for something to get 5 stars out of me it better wash my truck and give a good massage as well ;)",

It\u2019s well made and holds lots of things. I purchased the double rack and glad to have it for double space but we also have a large family and lots of dishes.",
