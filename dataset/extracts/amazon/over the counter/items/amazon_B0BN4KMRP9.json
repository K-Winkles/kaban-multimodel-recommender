                "reviewText": "I thought the width was adjustable, but it isn't. Maybe I read it wrong, so I'm not taking stars away for that. Regardless, I hit the lottery on this rack; it fits my sink (exactly 33 inches wide) so perfectly, it's like the engineers came to my house and took measurements with space age instruments! The assembly directions are a joke, but it's very easy to see how it all goes together. I had mine assembled in about 30 minutes, and I'm an old lady with arthritis. I was worried about purchasing this, as I have never had one before, but it's one of the best things I've ever bought through Amazon. I absolutely love it!",
