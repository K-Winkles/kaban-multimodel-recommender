The instructions were included and the bottom and base didn't really need any attention with exception of the drain spout.NOW I absolutely hate to admit this, but no matter how much I looked at the instructions, I could not for the life of me get the 2 sides to hook on. I will say I would have liked a bigger picture. Finally, I was so frustrated, I asked my husband to do it. I tried for 15 minutes and he did it in less than 2 minutes \ud83d\ude44.The dish rack itself is solid and in no way flimsy for me. You'll see see have dishes in it that my husband did. I did mine a little different than he did. You have the option to hang the racks where you want and works best. The way we have our extra racks, you'll notice they hang past the dish drain, so you may have drips on your counter depending on the way you set it up.The overall size is a bit smaller in person than I had invisioned, but it definitely does the job!I do see it working best for a smaller family, or a family that has dishes that aren't dishwasher safe and need to hand wash. It has a nice look to it and price was, I thought it was fair. I have replaced my plastic one with this one, and it just has a nice sleeker look' as well no further concern for broken plastic slots thay don't keep my dishes upright4 stars... as it's a wee bit smaller than i anticipated, even though the dimensions were displayed. Also the fact the instructions could have been clearer for me!",
