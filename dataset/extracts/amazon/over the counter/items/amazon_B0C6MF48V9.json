                "reviewText": "I'm using these on the back of my workbench in the garage. Yes, these are overkill but I don't have to worry about them bending or breaking with all the tools and equipment I have loaded on them.Are these expensive? Yes. Are they too expensive? Commercial shelving such as in kitchens need to withstand lots of abuse and still be cleanable to satisfy safety standards. So for that environment, the cost is reasonable. For home use though, less expensive options exist.These are high quality shelves without doubt. I just wish they had included a piece of paper with the assembly instructions on it so I didn't have to save and print out an image from the product page :-(",

There's also a white stripe running down the center of both shelves I couldn't pull off, so I'm guessing it's supposed to be there? It's not shown in the listing photos. I was able to assemble this by zooming in on the listing photos to figure out how the bolts are supposed to be put in place. Another thing to note was that some of the holes on the legs were not fully punched out, so I couldn't put the lower shelf at the level I wanted, because I didn't have the strength to punch the hole open. These can hold a lot, and I was able to replace two different shelves in my art room with this single shelving unit. Just wish it was made better and came with instructions.",
