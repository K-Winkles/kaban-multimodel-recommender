I am so glad I did! The little rubber stickers that go on the bottom ensure the board does not slide around. I love that it is clear as well so there is no eye sore there. I have chopped several things on it with no harm done. It is so sturdy and definitely a great new addition to my kitchen tools.",

The plastic shreds across the surface show deep missing portions after first use and are non traceable in eating after cooking but obviously going into our stomachs and are not safe for human gut or digestive system. I\u2019m disgusted thinking of the shred plastic particles in my family after I try so hard to cut vegetables for healthy foods to help guard against cancer but the plastics are going in! I destroyed the box or I\u2019d return immediately! Don\u2019t buy this poison plastics chinese board!",

These are perfect for work areas so I do t have to worry about chips if I put something on counter for food/ coffee prep etc. these are great. When I first received them I thought I was missing acrylic tabs in one box but they were there. Be careful when unboxing because they may fall out of box. These are perfect. Wish I had them before chipping counter.",
