                "reviewText": "The hall bathroom is my son's primary bathroom. He's a teenager, and thus a slob. But it's also the guest bathroom. While we're working to keep him on track with picking up every day, even if it's just for five minutes, he's still getting the hang of it. One of his problems is keeping organized. He does so much better with things in view, whereas I prefer them tucked out of sight to make things look cleaner.But I thought that this shelf looked pretty nice and that it would be useful. I so glad that I picked it up.It came with all the hardware and with a screwdriver, so it can be set up right out of the box. There are no instructions, but it's super easy to figure out. The two short, fat pieces are the end pieces. There are indents to fit the two shelves into on either end piece, and there's no way to get them backward or upside down, as long as you match up the tops/bottoms of the end pieces. The skinny pieces that are rails for the top shelf fit have dowel rods installed, so they push right into those holes. The easiest way to do this thing is to fit the bottom shelf to one end piece and screw it in. The holes are predrilled and lined up perfectly, so it's not super hard to do. Except the screwdriver is very slim, so grab a fatter one if you have big hands, or you'll be cursing that screwdriver after the first screw is fully fitted in.After the first level shelf, screw in the second level shelf. Then the top rail with dowel rods pop right in the holes. Once all that's done, line up the other end piece to the other shelves. It might take a bit of work, and one of my shelves had a slight gap, so the screws didn't go in all the way, as it was already tightly screwed into the other end piece. Not a problem for me, as the screw went in 3/4 of the way or more, and it didn't rattle or wobble and felt very sturdy.Once it's all fitted together, it looks awesome! I guess it's a farmhouse look, but I'm not a decor expert. While it's a pale gray color with a streaky, whitewashed look, it also has a pale beige color to the wood. So, it's very versatile. The colors that shine through are going to depend on your decor, as they're blended very subtly.I fit in a spare toilet paper roll and a packet of cleaning wipes on the bottom shelf, instead of packing it with toilet paper. Up top is his toothpaste, skin cleaning products, brush, a decorative sign, a mirror, and a few other small items. It's gotten everything up off the counter that I needed up, plus is extra storage for toilet paper that isn't in your face for guests who use up the end of the roll on the hanger.It looks really nice. It's useful. I only spent ten minutes putting it together. Price is great and it looks awesome. If it wasn't so darn efficient at storage, I'd pick up another!",

                "reviewText": "I really love the look of this little shelf that you put on the back of your toilet. It has the old farmhouse rustic look. It was really easy to put together. Then when I tried to go put it on the back of my toilet I was bummed because it didn't fit luckily it fit the back of my upstairs toilet. So just beware that it only fits on top of the back of certain toilet lids. It would also be cute to put on a desk or shelf or uses a decorations so doesn't just have to go on the back of your toilet. I really liked it though so yeah I would definitely recommend as long as you get the measurements and make sure it will fit if you're going to use it for putting on the back of your toilet.",
