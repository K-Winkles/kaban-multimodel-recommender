I use them on manual mode and they are very easy to turn on and off and are the perfect brightness.I did use additional 3M double-sided adhesive (that I purchased myself) on the magnets and I think that's why they are still stuck firmly in place. This is my only suggestion to improve these!Overall I am very pleased with these lights and would recommend them 100%.",

So glad so many products are being made rechargeable now.These are much brighter than the battery ones. They have a nice feature of being red when you plug them in to charge and turning green when they are done so you don\u2019t have to guess.The sensors are good. Not too sensitive but work in a reasonable amount of distance. No hand waving because they went off before I was done with them. They stay on as long as something is moving.LOVE that the metal they stick to has sticky on the back. No drilling to mount them. They are super lightweight. Even without the batteries in the old ones these are still lighter.If you are having trouble deciding between your options, you\u2019ll be pleased with these.",

I've had one go out, but this week all three went out within minutes of each other. The 3 pack only offers one recharge cord. Maybe if 2 where offered it would be better?As it is, I'm currently searching for a different solution to my kitchen lighting issue and will then just toss these as they just won't work for me.Initial Review: Comparing this item to something similar I purchased pre-Sandy storm, I So Prefer the pre-Sandy purchase that's NLA. I used the pre-Sandy units to not only light my walk home from work but also light the inside of my home for the 10 days I was without power.Purchased this item to give me a little more light in my kitchen, thought the 3 pack would suffice, but I'd recommend purchasing twice as many as you plan.Admit that I like the USB recharge option of this unit vs battery only option of my pre-Sandy unit and don't recall my pre-Sandy purchase offering a remote device (on, off, or motion detection).",

Compared to battery powered small lights which are very cheap, these are literally twice the price.
