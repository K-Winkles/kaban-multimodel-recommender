This looked like a great solution the rack is okay in design but it\u2019s too long for my bathroom cupboard doors \ud83d\ude16 I could mount it to the wall but that defeats the reason I bought it in the first place. For now it\u2019s hanging on the outside of the cupboard but I really hate the look. So before you buy measure to make sure it will fit inside the cupboard.",
