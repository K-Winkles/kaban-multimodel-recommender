                "reviewText": "3 PACK 14 GRIDS Travel Pill Organizer Box w/ 294 Brand LabelsThe first thing I tested on these was whether the lids would \"drift\" shut rather than staying fully open (a big problem with plastic containers). I bent the lids fully open and they stayed there.I received 3 sheets of Mon-Sun stickers, and 21 sheets of brand-name med labels. (I think it was supposed to only be 20; the last one had a double.) It's a pretty impressive array of labels, and many of them have different labels for things like \"chewables\" or \"kids\". Most are alphabetized, but a couple are out of alphabetical order and are instead stuck with other similar meds. There's even generics in there like Equate brand.In the bigger slots I was able to put in AND close with a full snap (see pics): 4 fish oil pills, 20 ibuprofen MINI gels.In the smaller slots I got 25 adderall and 30 zyrtec (could've put more zyrtec but that was a full month's worth so I stopped).I *really* recommend scanning all of the label sheets so that if you need to switch things around later, you can print them out on your own sticky paper and re-label.",

                "reviewText": "What I like:The best part of the whole package are the labels. I'm not sure how they're able to provide so many recognizable labels without some sort of copyright issue, but they sure are handy! They fit nicely in the boxes as well and make things easy to sort/find/use.What I don't like:Aside from the possibility of a copyright issue on the labels, the boxes are a bit too cheap in overall feel/quality. They feel like they were meant to be small fishing tackle boxes, more than pill boxes. The hard plastic hinge looks suspect, and the clasp can be tough until it's 'broken in' a bit. That said they are a handy solution for travel and first-aid kit use.",

It holds way more than we take regularly, so I doubled up on the Halls because the bigger compartment only holds two.If I could ask for one label it would be for Children's Ibuprofen. There's a label for an infant liquid, which is not even useful. I would also like a blank sheet of labels so that we can add our own in case one is not there, I had to use my label maker for the one it didn't have. And I have one empty for my husband's prescription med.Overall, it really holds a lot of your everyday medicine, and I like how compact it is, an it even comes with a soft pouch to keep it in.",

Goodness comes in groups of three? I love that I can have different items in each of these. Sized nice for portability. Easy to access. Added benefit was the preprinted labels to aid in easily identifying what is in the compartment if you are using it for non RX pills. The latches seem to be well made so no worries of an accidental spill of your medicines.Thank you for reading my review.
