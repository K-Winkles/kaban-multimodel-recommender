                "reviewText": "This is a very nice sized cutting board, sits over 1/2 a double sink properly and leans on the counter away from valuable counter workspace when not in use. Very flat and rubber corners keep it in place while chopping, cutting or whatever you may use it for. The reason for only 4 stars is the strainer does not fit very snuggly into the contoured hole, a little annoying for smooth scraping of scraps into it for disposal.Overall I am pleased and recommend you can give it a try.",
