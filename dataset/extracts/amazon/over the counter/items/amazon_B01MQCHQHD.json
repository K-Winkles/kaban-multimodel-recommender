Only thing that should be improve is an easier way to clean underneath the bottom of the colander (metal rim underneath). Sometimes I have pasta that sometimes gets lodged in there and it can be a challenge at times to get it out. I would buy this again and I wish I got this sooner. Game changer!",

I'll not make sweet pickles with out it again. I've also used it when washing potatoes and other veggies and for draining pasta. Very useful!!",
