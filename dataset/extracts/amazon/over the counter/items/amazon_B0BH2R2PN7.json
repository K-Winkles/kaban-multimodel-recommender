                "reviewText": "Nice little light for illuminating my stovetop that's way better than the tiny light on the bottom of the microwave. Brighter than the rechargeable type I tried first. Vey easy to install.The warm white color temperature provides excellent color rendering, similar to the type of lighting found at cosmetic counters. This is an important feature for me, to help see exactly what's going on in the pan. The price of this lamp is less then the cost of replacing that incandescent light under the microwave, it uses less electricity, is brighter and it will last a lot longer I'm sure.",

                "reviewText": "I really like these little lights, the two brightness modes are great. They can also be turned off and on independently of each other when linked. I bought a 2 pack of lights and then a 3rd to link to the existing ones. Unfortunately, I need a linking cable which the single light does not come with.It says that 2 more more can be linked but how can we link more than 2 with cables if there is no way to get additional cables? Very disappointed in this discovery.",
