I am very much satisfied with this item, and assembly was so easy and quick! Definitely recommended for anyone who tends to have a lot of dishes and a small kitchen!",

However, it is only for very small quantities of lightweight items, perhaps a few glasses and dishes -- and I mean lightweight dishes, not heavy stoneware-type plates. The utensil tray is **extremely** shallow. I put steak knives in with the sharp points at the bottom of the utensil holder, and it is not even deep enough to conceal the entire sharp edge of the blade. Also the utensil holder is far too small to hold more than a few items. Unless you are using plastic utensils or tiny dessert-sized forks, etc. they will be falling out of the holder because it is not deep enough to hold any weight.Okay for the price, but I use it as an additional drying rack for a few glasses etc. I would not trust its stability for anything more than that.",

                "reviewText": "This rack is sturdy and a perfect fit for my counter. I just wish I had the option to hang the utensil holder on the outside of the rack to maximize rack space. The holes won\u2019t let water drip due to the angle it leans when it is hanging on the outside. I love everything else about it so definitely not a deal breaker.",
