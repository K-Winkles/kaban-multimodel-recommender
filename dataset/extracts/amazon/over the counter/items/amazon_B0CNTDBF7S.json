                "reviewText": "I bought this pill organizer recently as a way to take a variety of medications with me out and about while on a vacation. Overall, I'm happy with this product. But depending on intended use, there might be better options.How I used this organizer: I used each compartment to contain a different medication so that I could have a variety of potential needs at my fingertips--Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Antacids, and some of my needed daily medications. I then taped the medication label to each of the organizer tabs so I could identify what it contained. This organizer worked well for this purpose to have a significant supply of my smaller pills and a couple of doses of larger pills. Basically, it could get me through a couple days of being in motion and away from my hotel room without restocking.What this organizer won't be good for: I typically take a lot of vitamins that are on the larger side. I simply couldn't fit these and left behind for this trip. Another example is a standard tums--I could only fit 2 tums in the compartments I had available, so I committed a couple of compartments to Tums. If you are someone that has pills on the larger size, this just isn't going to work well for you. Admittedly, I haven't found a good compact option when large pills are needed.Overall, very helpful to have an emergency stash while out and about on vacation, and a high quality compartment that seems like it will hold up to daily use.",
