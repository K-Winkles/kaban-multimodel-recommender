                "reviewText": "I have tested a lot of these types of under counter lighting units and this one definitely rises to the top of the best list.PROS: after moving the mounting location around quite a bit (using the very strong, very cool looking magnetic mounting option included), I've settled on the outside of the lower drawer of my oven so as to light the flooring in my small kitchen. I'm super impressed with how strong the magnetic mount is.I also particularly like having a remote control to easily not only make adjustments to all lighting features but also includes a timer option (15 min, 30 min, 60 min). Given where I've opted to place this light, the remote is super handy as I don't have to physically have the light in hand to make changes. The three light modes (blue-ish, white and \"yellow\") combined with the brightness and trigger options make this a stand out under counter light. Each light option is bright and clear and the range from brightest to lightest is noticeable and helpful for all types of situations.I can absolutely see the benefit of the \"day motion\" feature although I don't use it as such - I've set it for \"night motion\" and it hasn't failed me in any way, shape or form. It's holding a charge very well, the motion sensor range is spot on (not overly nor under sensitive), and the light responds well to the remote from quite a distance.CONS: only one - and this is purely an aesthetic \"me thing\" - the total length of the light is about 16\" and 3\" of that is dedicated to, I presume, the mechanisms, housed in a silver band (i.e. does not light up). When you mount the light and center it over the magnetic mounting piece and turn the light on, the light is not centered - it's off because of this 3\" portion that's not lit. If you care about this detail: you have to either mount it so the entire 16\" unit is centered to the eye (when NOT lit) OR mount it off center so that when lit, the lighted portion is centered. This drove me absolutely crazy because neither is ideal, which is why I opted to place this in a location where you don't notice it when it's not on - you only see the perfectly centered lighting when it's on.",

                "reviewText": "There are a lot of under counter motion sensor lights out there, but this one is more versatile than most and it works really well. First of all, it has a remote, which isn\u2019t usually the case. Next, it\u2019s round rather than flat. Then it has a magnetic piece that attaches to it and is shaped so that you\u2019re able to turn the light around to face different directions while it\u2019s still attached to the magnetic piece as it turns. For example, if it\u2019s under the cabinet and facing outward to give light as you walk into the room and you decide to walk to the counter and do something, and it\u2019s shining right in your eyes, then you just reach over and turn it so that it adjusts the light downward out of your eyes and onto what you\u2019re doing on the counter in front of you. That\u2019s a really nice feature that\u2019s unique. You can attach it to something metal using the magnet or use the sticky patch on the bottom and attach it to other surfaces. I like this one better than others I have. I highly recommend it.",

It stopped working, so I assumed the battery was dead. After a full charge and set back up, it wouldn't work. The sensor turned on randomly, but not when I would try to trigger it, and the remote stopped working completely.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because every time I would get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I would fear turning on the light because it would feel like the lights would bounce off of everything and be brighter than the sun.So when I got this I was very excited and found out that it has a magnetic mount! It also came with a remote which was very necessary because I have a cat that would absolutely set off the motion sensor nonstop if I were to keep it on. So I set it up and put it on the lowest level of light that I could and put it on a towel rod that wasn't being used. Lo and behold Mother Nature called again in the middle of the night and I walked into the bathroom and used the remote to turn the light on and find that I could see without having to squint and try and navigate the room from memory.",

The light is bright and adjustable on the type of white. I love the more warm white so this is great. I will say, the battery doesnt last long when its set on motion detection. I probably got 4 days worth and then it started flashing for about a day and then died. So I am taking a star off for this but if the battery lasted longer, it would be a 5 star!",

I don't use the motion sensor much but it works well. I like that I can change the temperature and brightness, it can get very bright, depending on the task. To be able to move the direction of the light is another great thing. Is easy to take the light off the magnet if you need it somewhere else. The remote is a bonus but is good to have the button on the light itself, not all of them do. If you lose the remote you can still use the light. Is a good light.",
