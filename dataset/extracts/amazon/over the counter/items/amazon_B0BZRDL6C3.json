                "reviewText": "Works well in a smaller kitchen with limited counter space. Been using it for a bit now and I haven't noticed any issues. Assembly is super easy, I can start using it right out the box, which is good because I made sure to do just that. Even if something pops off, it isn't too difficult to fix. It's held up to everything I can throw at it and it's still standing",

                "reviewText": "It's competitively priced, when viewing others.I do wish it was a tad bit bigger. However it's perfect to hold dishes from a typical night's dinner, provided I wash my bigger pots and pans after use and let them dry while we eat, or pull out the dry mat that I have. Plus it's advertised as a space saver, so makes sense that it's not huge. Just know that you're not going to easily slide anything too big into the bottom portion, as bigger pots and even dinner plates do not fit through the opening. So plates go on top, for sure, and smaller stuff in the bottom. Thankfully it is very sturdy. It's not going to collapse, and my teenager has already tested that capability \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude06I apparently had mine put together wrong, which is why I couldn't figure out how to hang the basket where the description shows. So make sure you piece it together properly \ud83d\ude01It's very easy to take down and put up, therefore going to be very easy to keep clean. Having the extended water spout is a huge plus and great addition to this piece.As long as it's true to it's word, about being rust resistant, this thing should hold up for years. At this price, it's definitely a bargain.",

                "reviewText": "This drying rack is outstanding. There are good instructions for assembling it, but I didn't even need them. It goes together easily, and with both a wrench and screwdriver included, tightening the screws is a cinch.The drip pan is very well designed. The drain is at a slight depression and the drain tube can be shifted to drain from any of three sides, depending where you want to place it next to your sink. The drain tube also telescopes, so you can place the rack right next to the sink or up to a couple of inches away from it. My husband poured water onto the drip pan, and it drained immediately into the sink.At first I thought that the utensil rack did not hang properly, but then my husband pointed out that I had the screws and nuts turned the wrong way. He took them out and put the nuts facing inside the rack instead of outside, and then the utensil compartment hung flat as it is supposed to.My only criticism is that the outside of drinking glasses which are hung from the glass rack actually drip outside the drip pan. That necessitates wiping up the counter.Otherwise I think this works perfectly.",
