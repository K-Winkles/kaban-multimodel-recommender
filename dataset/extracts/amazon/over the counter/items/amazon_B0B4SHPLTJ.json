                "reviewText": "I loved these lights so much, I bought another pair. I have other types of closet lights that are motion detect on/off lights. They are ok, but the batteries tend to die quickly because the motion sensors are always powered. These Amazon lights are touch button, so they are much kinder to the batteries.One thing of note: The on/off buttons are not temperature sensitive - it requires a tiny bit of pressure to trigger the button. I've found there are three spots along the light panel where the light switches click on/off very easily. It takes very little pressure to trigger the buttons and its not annoying in any way to me.They are very bright with 11 LEDs. The mounting panel is a good addition, and makes replacing the batteries much easier. It can be screwed in using supplied hardware, or stuck on the wall. The battery panel lid is a little tricky, so be gentle with it. One minor gripe that is not a dealbreaker to me: One of the mounting brackets seems to not hold the light tightly enough, so that when either of the two buttons at each end are pressed, the whole light moves in the bracket. I remedied the problem by taping two little rubber spacers/feet on each end against the back of the light which presses against the wall. Now it doesnt move when pressed. Yay. Amazon should consider redesigning the plastic back of the light accordingly... or at least provide two little stick-on rubber spacers in the hardware pack, IMO.Minor gripe aside, I love these little lights, and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This light is works exactly as expected it's a motion sensor light so when someone is moving it STAYS on. You can change the color of the light which is cool and it's NOT too bright so it will not disturb the spouse with a bright light. To change the color push the little button on the side. I'm very happy with the purchase and feel great about how it works... I saw these at a house and have been wanting a set of them and I think not turning on the bright light may help me get back to sleep quicker.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Shih Tzu that's getting old and developing cataracts. She's developed a heart murmur and is currently taking medication. She's fine and we do the very best we can do by her. She's very comfortable.Lately she's been refusing her food and it's become concerning. I noticed she would approach it as if it were questionable. I've tried everything I could to get her to eat. Then I thought she might not see it very well. I placed a light high enough above her food that it's not in her eyes while providing ample light to see.She's begun eating her food again and gaining weight and it's the very best thing in the world to me!They stick to the surface of my dresser very well. It's impossible to remove them without some serious effort. I wouldn't use these on drywall or painted surfaces unless you're absolutely certain that's where you want them to remain forever!I originally purchased these to light up a couple bookshelves, but now I'm gonna have to buy more. They're not extremely bright, but they're mostly great for nightlights or display lighting. They've helped my dog, so that deserves 5 stars in my book!The color changes are super cool! Timers and brightness levels make it fun and customizable. The remote is excellent and you only have to be close to it in order to activate it with the remote. I can do it from the side of the dresser out of line of sight. Maybe a foot or two, but that's pretty impressive.I really do like these little puck lights and I'm interested in finding it if they have a rechargable version with brighter lights.Overall I love them and I plan to buy more very soon!",

We installed a total of eight of these items, 2 per cabinet. Read they are hard to remove. I am renting and can't damage the underside of the cabinets.Bought box of batteries from Amazon too. More than disappointed. I feel stuck. Amazon better not expect me to pay to return these things, if they can be unstuck with no damage. If not - then I am the one stuck! Reviews real confusing as they are about 4 diffirent types of lights. Not many on under the cabinet - not motion.",
