        "description": "Advil Dual Action Back Pain Caplets combine two top selling pain fighting ingredients to fight back pain in two ways: acetaminophen blocks pain signals and ibuprofen targets pain caused by inflammation. Each dose contains 250mg of ibuprofen and 500mg of acetaminophen to quickly relieve tough back pain and provide 8 hours of relief. This pain reliever provides relief from upper back pain, lower back pain, and a wide variety of other aches and pains, including, headache, toothache, muscle pain, and minor aches associated with arthritis. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the caplets allows you to take a lower maximum daily dose of each pain medication, while still having 8 hours of powerful relief. For 35 years, Advil has been a top selling over the counter pain reliever, providing safe and effective pain relief when used as directed. Advil is tough on pain, not the planet (1). We reduced the plastic in over 80 million bottles by 20 percent (1). Advil is committed to your health, well-being, and the environment (1). (1) In 2022, Advil changed its technology to keep more plastic out of the environment, resulting in a 20 percent reduction compared to the previous 2021 bottle. We continue to use the same waste reduction technology today.",
