It works OK and serves the purpose of enabling more things to be stacked on my bathroom shelf, but it doesn't look very good. At least it was easy to assemble.",

It was a snap to put together IF you follow the instructions\u2026put it together upside down then you don\u2019t have to worry about having a third arm to hold it. It\u2019s perfect, another great Amazon purchase.UPDATE: For those of you that want to use it in the bathroom and barely have enough room around the sink for it to sit on\u2026I just put a very small dab of hot glue on the legs that are perched precariously on the edges of the sink and they aren\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere. Now they are even more perfect!!",

                "reviewText": "This thing looks just like the picture, and is fairly nice esp for the price. Unfortunately, it only really works for a right sided corner or it kinda looks funny. The main complaint is that it was a pain in the butt to put together. It required a husband's help as it came in many pieces that required many steps. Otherwise, I love it. Amazon suggests I mention its sturdiness or ease to clean. Its a little wobbly so I wouldn't recommend it for a spice rack that will hold lots of small things you will be shuffling often. And its pretty easy to clean cuz im short and its a shelf that i can reach.",
