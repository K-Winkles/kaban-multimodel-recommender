                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I am NOT a doctor so please check with your doctor first before use! Okay so I love diurex; my roommate & I both use it for different reasons. I have edema (severe water retention) of both legs, my roommate has high blood pressure. Be very careful with this if you have low blood pressure, fyi! Anyway, it helps my legs stay normal and it lowers my roommate's blood pressure but also BE SURE to take a POTASSIUM CHLORIDE supplement and get some ELECTROLYTES too as water loss also means loss of potassium & sodium so we both take a potassium supplement as your body NEEDS it to function properly. That being said, it's very useful for both water retention & high blood pressure. AGAIN, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE USING THIS. This is just my experience & my roommate's with it; we both see it as helpful. Be sure to eat something & also drink lots of water with it which sounds stupid but when your body is retaining water, it's because it thinks your body needs more water which is why it holds on to water in the wrong ways which cause bloating, cramps, etc. So if you take this AND drink water, you'll feel and look better because your body will not retain water, knowing that it's being hydrated as the diurex releases that bloating. I'm not sure why it lowers blood pressure almost immediately but it does. Just be careful if you have normal blood pressure because low blood pressure can also be quite dangerous. Potassium and water with electrolytes along with this is my go to the ease my edema effectively but everyone is different! Also, I much prefer this over the kind with caffeine in it. I don't feel that the caffeine is necessary for me as I get that with my morning coffee, so that just depends on your preference.",

I started taking these yesterday, I already don't think I will they will be working. I only took two yesterday. I took one in the morning and one after dinner, I didn't take any afternoon ones because I wanted to see what the two would do for me. However, I did drink fluids throughtout the day. Well, I am still waiting to go to sleep because I never went to sleep last night because I was up all night long throwing up. Just the two pills made me so sick ! It threw my balance off. I could hardly walk.",
