It is also very sturdy, as it routinely holds my large cast iron dutch oven with no problems. It is easy to clean... I usually just wipe it down, but also have thrown it in the dishwasher with no problems. Lastly, it rolls up nicely when not in use and stores easily under the sink. Totally recommend the product for anyone who needs a space-efficient drying rack or extra counter space.",

Fits our sink perfectly (good to measure before you buy) and clears our counter for more work space. I dry and roll it frequently. It fit 3 pans and lids and some utensils and bowls, carefully, tonight! My only regret is not buying it sooner.",

The rods are solid steel, not hollow, and the silicone coating all over makes it totally non-slip; that's exactly what I need so I can put pots of boiling water, etc on it when camping and have no worries about it failing on me. I went out on a limb and bought the green one - if it didn't work I could return/exchange for grey, but it's a beautiful, stylish green with a nod to teal and I'm definitely keeping it.FYI I ordered the Large for a 20.7 inch (at widest) camping side-stove-table and it works. My sink, also pictured, is 17\" wide and it also works fine there.Worth every penny! Top quality and will last years I'm sure.",

I have a single sink and the rack covers half of it, which makes the drying function a little difficult\u2014I have to wash pots, etc., set them on the counter, drain the sink, and then rinse them and set them on the rack to dry.

                "reviewText": "I have a relatively large sink, but a small kitchen with limited countertop space so I am always looking for ways to add extra space anywhere I can. I also LOATHE drainers on my countertops because they take up room and are ugly. This roll up dish drying rack provides a solution to that and so much more! No more puddles of water under your dishes, it all goes right into the sink. You can have dishes drying and still have some sink space left to wash. I use this rack to rinse off my veggies and fruits and the water goes straight into the sink. I can have dirty dishes on one side of my sink under the drainer and still wash and place clean dishes on top giving me more time and space when baking as I use every dish in the house when I cook. The drainer will roll away and store easily under the sink. I don't usually do that because I always have dishes needing a good wash up. Additionally, it is not unattractive when it is unrolled so I don't bother putting it away, I just roll it up and let it sit as seen in the photos. Admittedly, it works better with larger sinks, but there are several sizes so look them up and give it a try. The material is rubber coated and heavy enough not to bend when weight is on it. I can't think of anything that could be better about this except maybe if they had it in the color of my sink! (Coffee) You will not be disappointed if you buy this drying rack. Promise.",
