                "reviewText": "This product is a nice alternative to chemical-laden products for the same purpose. It appears to work, which is exactly what it needs to do. It is also a good value for the money. There are some issues, however, that bring it down to a 4 star product. First of all, it is old-school in that it is not an immediate cure. For those accustomed to the \"one day\" products, this one might disappoint in that way. Secondly, it is also old-school in that you use it at night and have to stay in bed until the morning. And please wear a pad or be ready for wetness. These things are not daunting enough for me to refuse to purchase it in the future.",

I used two nights in a row, slight burning but it subsided. It said it may burn a little. The next morning the skin was red, inflamed, and burning. Not worth it !!!!",

                "reviewText": "This was an interesting thing to try for sure. The concept is simple. It\u2019s a syringe with a rounded top that\u2019s easy to insert. To be honest, I really didn\u2019t feel it being administered. I had to double check if it was actually dispensing anything. The solution is lightweight and almost oily. I found it easy to dispense, though I had some trouble getting the last bits out. It has to be used laying down to avoid leaks, so make sure you have a trash can next to you. They also suggest using a pantyliner for leakage, but I would suggest taking it further considering the amount of residual wetness I woke up to. It can be a bit convenient to have to stay still for the night, but it\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t have an urgent situation. It doesn\u2019t solve my problems overnight, but it did get me through the night. I like it enough to use again.",
