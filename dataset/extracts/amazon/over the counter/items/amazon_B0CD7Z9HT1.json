                "media_text": "Why Litever Plug-in Under Cabinet LED Lights Kit ? 1. Power Adapter of Higher Power Load. While many other competitors are using a much smaller 24W or even 12W power adapter, this Litever Under Cabinet LED Light Strip Kit adopts a Class 2 Certified 36W power adapter. Higher power load allows us to make the LED light bars of higher power and thus brighter LED light bars.Plus, this higher power load power adapter allows you to add extra LED light bars to this Litever 6-Light-Bar Under Cabinet Lights Kit to match different layouts. 2. More Reliable Power Adapter of Longer Lifespan. While many others are using power adapters of standard components and can only last for maximum 6000~8000 hours (or even less), Litever choose power adapters adopting more reliable core electrical components (capacitors) and can last for more than 20,000 hours. Many others are saying that LED lights can last for more than 50,000 hours. Actually, that\u2019s not true.Though the LED light strips or bars (as well as the dimmer or cables) themselves actually can last for more than 50,000 hours indeed, the power adapter, which feeds them, can NOT last for 50,000 hours.Many others are using power adapters of lifespan less than 6000 hours but still declaims that their lights can last over 50,000 hours. 3. Extendable and Easy to DIY to Match Your Cabinet Layouts. Many other similar under cabinet lights are NOT extendable at all. Or, they do not sell extra parts for DIY. However, following \"Recommended Layout\", you can buy extra LED light bars, extension cables, power splitters to add into this Litever Under Cabinet Lights Kit for DIY. Plus, you can buy Litever compatible motion sensor switches or door-activated switches to DIY them into motion activated or door-activated lighting kits for more applications, i.e, closet lights, safe lights, wardrobe lights, night lights, etc.",
