                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve been struggling for months to find a dish drying rack that will fit my unusually odd sink size, and have had no luck. My sink measures 14.5x16 inches, which I didn\u2019t think was an unusual size, but I can\u2019t seem to find anything that fits!!! Our countertop has become the drying rack. When I found this roll up dish drying rack I was skeptical, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I just received it today and it\u2019s definitely worth it, unbelievably sturdy, and super easy to clean. I still haven\u2019t put a lot of weight on it yet, but so far it can hold a few mugs, 3-4 small ceramic plates, and different utensils. I\u2019m most excited to use it when washing fruits and veggies, because now I won\u2019t have to take out a million bowls and colanders just to wash and dry them. The stainless steel rods look pretty good and legitimate, but I just wonder if over time they will magically begin to rust like other \u201cstainless steel\u201d products I\u2019ve ordered in my lifetime.As of right now, I love this thing and I highly recommend it if you have a tiny kitchen like mine, with minimal counter space. I\u2019ve included a few photos of what it looks like!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased the 16.2\" W x 17.7\" L roll-up dish drying rack for use over the right basin of our twin-basin kitchen sink to help combat the never-ending stream of bowls, cups and bibs that accompany having a 3-year-old and 1-year-old in the house. The combination of our dishwasher and previous counter-top dish drainer simply couldn't hold it all.We have stainless steel appliances with black accents, and were attracted to this rack because it appeared to match this color scheme quite well. I'm pleased to say that the appearance leaves nothing to be desired, and does nothing but increase the appearance of our sink area.Our sink is a drop-in unit possessing raised edges, as opposed to an undermount style. Because of this, I did a fair amount of research in an attempt to identify a roll-up dish drainer sized such that it could be positioned so the silicone end caps would contact the sink lip to avoid slipping. For sake of reference, the interior of our sink measures 13.5\" W x 13.5\" L, and the raised lip dictated a drainer measuring 16-17\" W x 16.25\" L. We purchased this rack because the width was perfect. I planned to simply cut down the length by removing one of the silicone end wraps and cutting 1.5\" off of the rods with my dremel tool.The 16.2\" W x 17.7\" L rack we purchased actually measured in slightly differently than advertised, at 16.625\" W (perpendicular to stainless rods), and 17.625\" L (parallel to stainless rods). Both measurements were taken from one end of the silicone end cap wrap to the other, as opposed to measuring only the length and width of the exposed stainless rods.The additional width was not an issue, and I was able to trim the anticipated 1.5\" of extra length in about 15 minutes with a dremel without issue. I was impressed to find that the OD of the stainless rods at the ends had been reduced and deburred, enabling a smooth fit into the end cap. After trimming to the desired length, the stability of the rack greatly improved since the silicone end caps could now contact the sink lip on both edges. It does not easily slide out of position, and feels much sturdier overall than I thought it would be. I've included a photo of the rack over our sink at the original length, and then again after trimming.The final product is aesthetic, much more hygienic than placing clean dishes directly in the sink to dry, and multi-functional. The roll/unroll feature is incredibly useful, and we find ourselves changing its size constantly as our need to use our right-hand sink basin fluctuates throughout the day. It is very handy to be able to soak a crock-pot or other pot/pan under the rack while drying dishes above it.We will be using ours to air-dry dishes and baby paraphernalia, drip-dry fruit and produce, and as a trivet to hold hot items above the countertop. We couldn't ask for a better or more functional kitchen accessory. Paired with our new over-sink dish drainer that replaced our old counter-top unit, we now have 3-4x the storage space while consuming far less precious counter space.I always read product reviews when contemplating a purchase, but seldom write one myself. I was so impressed with this simple tool that I felt I was obligated to do so.",
