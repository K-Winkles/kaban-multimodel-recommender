                "reviewText": "These lamps are very clean and simple looking, which I appreciate. They are also very thin and compact. If I weren't planning on using the motion sensors, I'd be unhappy with the switch set up\u2014multiple presses to go from on, to sensor, to off\u2014but since I am using the sensor, its a moot point. The second button controls brightness, alternating from ramping down and ramping up with each press. I took a fine sharpie marker and drew in the recesses of the on off buttons, since it was hard to see which was which where I have the placed.These come charged, but I emptied them (not knowing how fully charged they were) and recharged them completely. Leaving them on, they were still at about 80% of maximum brightness after 6 hours, and I got another two hours until I felt they were at a point where they really needed recharging. So\u2014for my use as in closet light, these should not require constant charging. Of course, I don't know how much of a battery drain the motion detector and switching circuitry are, so I expect that in use, I won't get 6 or 8 hours of usable illumination out of them. On the other hand, given how short closest visits usually are, I'm expecting at least a month between charges, which is fine.The light is close to around 6000 Kelvin, \"daylight\" which tends to be the brightest\u2014I haven't checked closely for color retention, but it seems to be reasonably accurate. While these emit light at close to 180\u00ba they are strongest over about 120\u00ba arc and I've decided to make a bracket that holds them slightly angled downwards (they are being mounted in a closet above the door) to make best use of the light. I will be using them on at full brightness, but the dimming does work fine.If these fail to last as long as they should, I will update this review.",
