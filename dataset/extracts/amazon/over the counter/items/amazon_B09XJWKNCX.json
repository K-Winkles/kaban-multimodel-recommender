                "reviewText": "First, this is surprisingly sturdy, especially given the price. Once you lock the main pieces in place there is no wobble, and the drainage tray slides out nicely. I don't like to read instructions or watch videos so I was confused at first about drain tray - then I realize it doesn't sit under the rack, it slides into the structure so it is raised about the counter (I eventually had to read the instructions and watch the video to get there).Mine sits partially under a cabinet so I can't use the top rack for dishes; instead I am using it for utensils, and I am using the utensil tray to hold my sponge, scrubber, and brush (I positioned it on the sink-facing side). It looks like the cutting board holder could also be used for pot lids.My only quibble is the draining spout isn't quite long enough for the design of my sink - my sink has a lip around it so the rack is set back from the edge by about half an inch, and the spout and tray barely cover the distance. I placed a felt dish-drying counter top pad underneath the whole thing to catch any stray water. Since the sink lip is a touch higher than the counter, the dish rack might not sit level - but it has little adjustable feet so I was able to compensate for the incline. Adjustable feet is a nice touch.The wire and metal components are strong, as is the rubber coating in places where dishes/glass might come into contact with metal. Its a very good value for the price.",

Aesthetically pleasing to look at vs other dish racks. It is sturday and holds dishes in their place as advertised. Making it easier to stack correctly for more room. I would recommend and purchase again. The only thing I would change is possibly more storage for glasses and utensils to dry. Otherwise I really like it.",
