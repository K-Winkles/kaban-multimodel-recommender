                "reviewText": "OMG, I am so in love with this shelf. If have a standard double stainless steel sink with a standard faucet (not one of the tall looping ones). There is a fluorescent light above the sink, and that light was being so wasted because I couldn't put plants under it. But NOW I have four quart-sized widemouth mason jars planted with herbs (google it) arrayed in the center of this shelf. There is room for one half-gallon mason jar on either side of the herbs, so I've got my kombucha to the left, my sugary kefir grains batch on the right, plus two pint-size jars with either milk kefir or seeds sprouting at either end. With the jars pushed back to the back edge of the shelf, there is also room in the front of the jars for half-pint jars all along the front. I've got my baking soda and coarsely ground egg shells (for Dom's sugary kefir grains recipe), plus there is plenty of room to put other things in those jars as well. I cannot believe I've got all of that in such a tidy, neat little space. And it looks so pretty!The shelf is plenty strong for holding all this stuff. It's like one of those big chrome shelfs you get at Lowe's or Home Depot, and it goes together the same way. Just be sure, when you put it together, that you have the plastic holder thingies with the top part on the top, not upside down. Also, you can put the holders for the top shelf up as high as they will go, and it makes for a very clean and stylish appearance. As with anything like this, count all your pieces before you begin assembly. They sent me two extra plastic shelf-holder pieces, so I'm saving them in case I need them at some future point, but these things are strong when the shelf is assembled.I wish now I had gotten another one of these to extend along to the right of this one, under my cabinets; eight more quart-sized jars will fit on top with eight more underneath! So that's my next purchase.",

They were also hogging some counter space. I thought I'd go with this since it was silver and bamboo, which are themes already present in my kitchen.The package came well; it was longer than I expected, but the shelves itself were intact as far as length (they're pretty sturdy which I appreciate now. My double sink is also longer than I estimated, so it was the perfect size. There are 6 pieces of metal: the 4 bars, the top shelf, and the bottom thing, which I placed on the sink with the back flush to the wall.I have a double sink with a spout where you have to lift a handle to get water; not the ones with knobs on either side. At first, I put it together, placed it behind my sink and when I lifted the handle, it hit the shelf! I saw that I was able to adjust it and made it at a length so it was level with the window sill that is behind the sink. I'm sure it will clear most sink handles. Mine is a little cozy, though.The bamboo plank that goes in the top shelf is not attached to the top shelf itself, and I actually liked it better without it so I'm using it without the bamboo insert. It made my kitchen look pretty (with the basil in front of the window) and not overly crowded, since the shelf has silver bars running across the entire length of it and has the see-through look. My orchid has joined the party and there is plenty of room.We'll see how long it lasts and how it holds up, but as far as appearances, ease of assembly, and practicality goes, 5 stars. Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "The reason I am giving it four stars is, first, the quality and strength of the metal shelf and bracket are weaker than I am used to with this type of chrome metal shelving. The supporting bottom bracket is also a little warped but it still works fine.Secondly, the screw in one of the leveling feet is a hair too small in so it fell out a couple of times. I had to screw in it a little more than I had to do with the others to keep it from falling out. But once I did that, it stayed in. I also used a bubble leveling bar to make sure it was perfectly level. I highly recommend doing that.Thirdly, the legs need to be a little longer than they are to accommodate most newer faucets. But, that was an easy fix. After reading all of the reviews, I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and used upside down 1.5 inch tea light candle votives to raise the shelf. The votives are glass and very well made so they work well. They also add a pretty little splash of accent color. I got them on Amazon as well as the caddy that sits on the self and the triangle rack in the corner of the sink. The sink mat is also from Amazon.I also put some vinyl shelf liner under the plank to protect it from water splash. The plank itself is beautiful birch, I think, so I want to make sure it stays dry.But other than those cons I mentioned, the shelf is really beautiful. It's simple and elegant with a bit of a professional chef kitchen look to it. And it is very long. My sink is 32.5 inches wide from outside edge to outside edge and the shelf's width is a perfect fit. I love how it clears my counter top space. My house is a 100 year old inner city duplex. The kitchen is not huge by any means but having the shelf really opens up the countertop space. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it. I tried to attach photos but the photo attachment thing doesn't seem to be working. I do wish I could show how beautiful my kitchen sink area is now with this shelf but you'll just have to take my word for it!",

The shelf was obviously a snug fit, so whoever popped the shelf in, forced it, and 2 small chunks of wood were splintered out. I have turned the shelf upside down so it is not noticeable but that was a little disappointing.",
