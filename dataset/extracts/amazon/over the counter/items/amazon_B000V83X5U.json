Cough When you're healthy, the cillia in your airways move mucus toward your through to either be coughed up or swallowed. But with a respiratory tract infection (like the common cold), mucus can build up in your airways and lungs, so your body has to cough to get rid of it. Chest Congestion Chest congestion is what happens when the mucus membranes (mucosa) that line your airways jump into overdrive. When you breathe in an irritant (like dust, bacteria or a virus), mucosa cells are attacked causing inflammation and extra mucus in your airways. This extra mucus is one of the ways your body tries to remove an irritant. Bi-layer Tablets Unique bi-layer tablets - One layer for immediate release, the other layer for extended release.",

                "reviewText": "Moved from east coast to west coast & developed seasonal allergies for the first time in my life. Constantly trying to cough up phlegm & clear my throat. It\u2019s really bad this year. I can\u2019t sleep or lay flat due to choking/coughing trying to clear throat. Tried various OTC \u201callergy medicines\u201d which relieved some of my nasal congestion but did nothing for constant throat phlegm. Took 1 of these tablets late last night & finally was able to get a good nights sleep. Woke up this morning with very mild nose congestion. No throat phlegm. None. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! I will be reordering this product, for sure.",
