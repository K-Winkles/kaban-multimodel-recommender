                "reviewText": "I wanted to add some second and third level space on my counter for my coffee station and this did not disappoint.This piece was easy to put together in under 30 mins while watching TV. I am also happy with the durability and versatility of this item it is just as sturdy fully extended as it is more compact and the hooks on the side I though I wouldn\u2019t use were immediately useful.Overall I have priced comparable shelving units for a while before I purchased my new coffee maker and this one stands out as a good buy.Hope this helps!",
