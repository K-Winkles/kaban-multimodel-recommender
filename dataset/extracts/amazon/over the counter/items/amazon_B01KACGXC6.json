The drainer is not plastic coated as someone else wrote in their review, but is powder coated paint over metal, which means it will eventually crack and rust. I expect it will last a year or 2 before that happens. It was a replacement for a rubbermaid drainer I had that was plastic coated, but even that one rusted after a couple years.
