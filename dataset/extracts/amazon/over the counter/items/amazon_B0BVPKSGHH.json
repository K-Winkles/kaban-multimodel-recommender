                "reviewText": "CA is recycling compostable food waste. Recycling in CA is made very easy by providing us recyclable-specific cans and curbside pick up. We already had a yard cart for yard and food waste for years but more recently it has become required. The garbage service thought they would provide a container for food waste in the kitchen - obviously the people who selected it don't spend time in the kitchen enough to recognize that many would not put what they provided in our kitchen because it is ugly, we don't have space for it and will quickly become a moldy mess in your kitchen! (Mine is in the garage unused as I write...but maybe those who want to keep rotting food in their kitchen for a few days might be Ok with it.) I found this and decided to try it out. It worked perfect to hang on a drawer next to the sink where I wash and prepare veggies to put food waste in and it has a good capacity for what I need as long as I walk a few steps to the outside can to empty at least daily! I line it with a bag that I reuse to keep it clean and I can collapse it when I don't need it!. My daughter saw what I was using and immediately had to have one too! (unknown to me, hers was banned from the kitchen after becoming disgusting) Don't get me wrong I agree with the idea of composting food waste rather than it going to land-fill - there are real issues with old landfills and we have 40 million residents producing trash daily! ...This container makes it simple! The only down side to the container is the door that is supposed to hold bags on the front fell off more than once when I was unpacking and setting up the container...since I am reusing bags it is not a problem for me.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased to use as indoor composted container. Originally selected because it could compact down but realized you can collapse it with the lid on. May have decided to go with something else had I realized this 1st (gray side panels aren't my favorite), but keeping because it is doing a great job!It was easy to put together. Love the way the top opens 2 ways. The sticker that comes with it is convenient for guests to know this isn't for trash. I put mine on the lid rather than the front (easier for people to notice). Also does a great job keeping the smell under control with the lid closed. The bag container is nice, but doesn't hold a lot.The extra piece is what to use if you want to be able to collapse the bin but keep a bag secure (when you can't have lid on).Overall recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I have limited mobility due to arthritis so carrying large trash bags downstairs to the dumpster is just too much. I use smaller bags so I can easily manage them and my cane.I live in a one bedroom apartment with a teensy weensy open concept kitchen. It suits me just fine but has some drawbacks with space. I tried storing a trash can under my sink, but it was messy and awkward to access. I tried putting the trash can out on the floor and I was constantly moving it out of my way. I knew there had to be a better way. And here it is!This clever little trash container fits over my kitchen cabinet doors so it's out of the way yet easy to access. I actually found it works best when I slide it over the handle to my oven door. I can toss food scraps right in the container as I use the cook top. (Of course I remove when using the oven.)The lid fits snuggly so smells don't leak out and it helps to stop the pesky fruit flies that seem to come from nowhere. Plastic grocery bags fit just fine, but since they often have small holes in them and leak I bought scrap bags to keep things tidy.While this is a wonderful thing for small kitchens I can see it working well in larger kitchen when you don't want to be walking back and forth from the counter to the trash can while prepping food. All the scraps that end up stinking up the kitchen can be wrapped in a plastic bag before tossing in the larger trash can.I'm so happy I found this helpful addition to my kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "I've been in need of a compost bin with a lid for a long time. Tired of the fruit flies! I was way excited when I got this. First and foremost, it is sturdy. I like the 2 ways to use the lid. The size is small so it doesn't take up much space, but I've found the last couple weeks that I've had it it's quite large as well. I originally hung this on the wall by the garbage and recycling cans, but that didn't take long for to the adhesive on the back of the hanger thing to decide not to hold it. So it sits on my countertop. The main thing I was happy for was how it says it stops the fruit flies. To my dismay, that is not true at all. The first couple days they were inside of it, laying eggs and all. Good thing it is easy to wash out, but don't buy this in hopes of no more fruit flies, it does not stop that. And so my search will continue and this will be used elsewhere as it is still a good can.",
