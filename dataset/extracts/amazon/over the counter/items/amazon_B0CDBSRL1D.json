                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this under-cabinet LED light for my home office, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance. The installation was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and the adhesive backing that came with the light.The light it emits is bright and clear, providing ample illumination for my workspace without being harsh on the eyes. It has a sleek design that blends well with my decor, maintaining a professional look. The energy efficiency of the LED is also a huge plus, as I have noticed no significant increase in my electricity bill, even with daily use.One of the best features is the convenience of the on/off switch, which is easily accessible. No need to fiddle with cords or remote controls; a simple tap is all it takes to light up my work area.However, I did notice that the light tends to get warm after prolonged use, which is something to keep in mind. But so far, this has not affected its performance or caused any problems.In conclusion, I highly recommend this under-cabinet LED light to anyone looking to enhance their workspace with efficient and stylish lighting. It's a solid product that delivers on its promises.",

They are good sized, much larger than similar priced ones. Bigger battery too so they should last longer between charges.
