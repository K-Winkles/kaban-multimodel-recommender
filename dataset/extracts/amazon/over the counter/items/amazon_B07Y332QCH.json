This rack fits perfectly. It actually is a little small so we used to the adjusters on it with ease and it holds lots of things. The silverware rack can be moved to either side as well.",

They should have used smaller spacing between the mesh because the end of the utensils are constantly going through the space on the sides and then get stuck when trying to pull a bunch out at once. I don't want to have to consciously think about placing them in absolutely perfectly every time. And while I like 3 sections for utensils, the unit is too small for 3 sections.",

Sturdy and has NOT rusted which is very important. My total came to $75 which is way too expensive for a dish rack (with free shipping). But I just wanted something that won't rust.",
