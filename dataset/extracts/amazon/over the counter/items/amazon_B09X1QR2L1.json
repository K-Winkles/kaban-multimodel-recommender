The buttons are hard to press. Sometimes I have to press more than once for a number to appear. The cheap tinfoil grate underneath keeps falling out when I open and close the door When I put food in and set the time but wait to push start until I am ready for it to cook, it not only cancels the time that I input but I have to remove the food and put it back in. Ridiculous. It did not come with a charcoal filter but I don\u2019t know if that is something you always have to purchase separately. If that\u2019s the case, it is very inconvenient since you need it. I will probably replace it soon. Total waste of money.",
