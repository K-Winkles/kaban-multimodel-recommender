                "reviewText": "We have an incredibly useless two bowl kidney shaped stainless steel sink, that is difficult to work in. We finally decided that one side was really only useful as a drying area, and I bought this roll up device. I like the way it looks, it fits perfectly, and it's easy to roll up halfway from either side if something manages to get in the sink. We have relatively hard water so once a week I wipe it down with a sponge on both sides and it looks great again. It seems to have the right degree of rigidity, the finish is non-slip, and if we ever figure out what to do with the second tiny bowl, we can whisk it off the sink easily, roll it up, and store it. Great device, and not very expensive IMO. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I tend to hand-wash a lot of our kitchen stuff, even when it says they are dishwasher-safe. In the past, I would wash an item, rinse it, and then turn off the water to dry it right away. That was driving me crazy, though not crazy enough to stop hand-washing. When we got a new double sink recently, I was cruising the aisles of my local \"big box\" hardware store, looking for a new faucet, and other things to make life easier, when I saw one of these racks in a sink that was on display. It was love at first sight. My wife usually rolls her eyes when I bring home a new gadget that she would never use, and this was no different - until I showed her how I was going to use it, and how it would make her life around the sink feel more fulfilled. Now, we both love it and wonder why it took us so long to find something like it. We didn't need a new sink. This would have worked fine on our other one.It is SO multi-functional. I've put hot pots on it, waiting for them to cool down before rinsing. She's using it right now to drain veggies she's cooking for dinner. I put rinsed-off cutting boards between the slats, to hold them upright to drain and let them dry after using them. It rolls or folds out of the way if we need to do something that requires both sinks. We don't have to look for a clean place to store it between uses - we just leave it there. It doesn't need to be screwed-down or glued-down. We just love it.There are a LOT of different racks like this on Amazon and in stores, but I recommend looking for one that is coated in silicone. Completely covered in silicone. Some of the choices I found had bare stainless steel with silicone on the ends of the rods. They might look pretty, but things will slide around on them. Silicone is very flexible, keeps things from sliding around, and can take pretty high heat. Make sure you measure your sink carefully. The main reason I chose this product over others is that it had the size I needed. You don't want it to hang over the edge of the sink or countertop too far. Since it is coated in silicone, you could trim off some excess if you needed some extra room for a smaller sink, but you'd probably be better off just folding or rolling it up to make room.Otherwise, I think you're pretty safe with many of the products. It would work best with an undermount sink that has a lip that goes all the way around it. That would be a cleaner look. I'm not sure how it would work on a sink that isn't undermounted.(Pay no attention to the unfinished look of the sink area. We are remodeling and haven't chosen a new backsplash yet).",

                "reviewText": "Of all the dish drainers, mats and racks I've purchased over the years, this one is the most helpful. It can lay across my sink to help wash veggies. It can spread out and become a cooling rack. But mostly it rolls out and holds my drippy dishes until they are dry. Then, I just roll it up and put it away, and unlike some of the others that take up space, this thing can slip behind or in front of most any cabinet or drawer. I love this thing. And the fact that I can put it in the top rack of my dishwasher, is the headline. Plus, because it is silicone coated, means it's not going to rust. I would definitely buy again and way sooner than I did!",
