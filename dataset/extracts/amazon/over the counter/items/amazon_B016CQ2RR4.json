Besides, a jumbled pile is a bit risky; one wrong move and the entire thing will come crashing down. This dish rack is the one thing you can depend on to do this task for you. Now having dishes in the sink really is no big deal. You simply wash \u2018em, plunk \u2018em on the dish rack and move on to the next thing.",

                "reviewText": "I like this dish rack because it is made from bamboo versus plastic. It is very sturdy, the adjustable parts fold outward or inward as far or as little as you want them to go, depending on what you need to dry. There's an upper tier for larger items such as pans, plates, and bowls. The bottom tier folds out for smaller items like cups or utensils. I fold this bottom tier back in when I don't need to use it, and it takes up less space. If you have very limited counter space I would get something smaller. Easy to care for, has instructions included. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "... it needs a little attention before you use it. The basic construction is good, but the edges of the bamboo have not been eased. You'll need to sand them to keep splinters out of your fingers. Everything is tight. Too tight. It is hard to get unfolded. Then it is hard to fold back. A little candle wax on the opposing surfaces helps. This rack will need to be dried regularly as mold is a problem with bamboo that stays wet. On the plus side, I like the sturdiness, design, and slot size. I like that it can be folded, laid flat and used as a drying surface. I like that it can be put away, will not rust and doesn't wobble. I think it is worth the price.",
