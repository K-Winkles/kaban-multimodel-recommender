I needed something space saving and durable. This had worked out perfectly!I love my new dish rack. I forgot how relaxing washing dishes can be and this new addition to my kitchen adds to it.It was easy to assemble. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I actually had my 11 and 15-year-old boys put it together for me..It's not at all heavy, but it's sturdy.Very well constructed..well-proportioned, maximizes the space that it takes. I love the over the sink design- when I open the window, It helps to dry the dishes faster.the excess water conveniently drips right Down into the sink and no more nasty, slimy, moldy, rubber mat underneath your clean dishes that you find with traditional countertop styles.Overall awesome space saving solution, versatile and a place for everything!!Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1. **Space-Saving Design:** The over-the-sink configuration optimizes kitchen space efficiently, making the MOUKABAL dish drying rack a great solution for smaller kitchens or those seeking to maximize counter space.2. **Two-Tier Utensil Holder:** The inclusion of a two-tier utensil holder adds an extra layer of organization, allowing for the efficient drying of various kitchen tools and utensils, enhancing overall kitchen functionality.3. **Large Stainless Steel Build:** The robust stainless steel construction not only ensures durability but also adds a sleek and modern aesthetic to the kitchen. The material is resistant to rust and corrosion, contributing to the rack's long-lasting performance.Cons:1. **Size Limitation:** While suitable for sinks up to 33 inches, the MOUKABAL dish drying rack may not be the ideal choice for larger sinks. Users with oversized sinks may need to measure carefully to ensure a proper fit.2. **Assembly Required:** Some users may find the assembly process a bit time-consuming or complex, and clear instructions would be beneficial to streamline the setup process.3. **Limited Color Options:** The availability of the dish drying rack in a single color may be limiting for those who prefer more variety to match their kitchen decor.4. **Price Consideration:** The premium stainless steel build may come with a slightly higher price point compared to other dish drying rack options. However, the added durability and aesthetic appeal justify the investment.Final Statement:The MOUKABAL Over-The-Sink Dish Drying Rack proves to be a valuable addition to any kitchen, especially for those with limited counter space. Its space-saving design, two-tier utensil holder, durable stainless steel build, and modern aesthetic make it a practical and visually appealing choice. Despite some considerations like size limitations and assembly requirements, the overall functionality and quality make it a recommended investment for an organized and efficient kitchen setup.",

I love that u can move the hooks, I put all, but 2, on front rail, since, back sits over back edge of my sink where faucet n handles are--in an old trailer and not that big of a sink or counter or kitchen. And you can change where the racks the dishes go on easily, since, they just hook over rails. They are 3 different designs. Only thing I didn't like is -the side rack for silverware and knives is over the counter and I don't have room to put the cutting board holder on outside of frame on the other side. So-I put it on inside and put my old silverware holder on it-lol. Gotta get a different one tho. Mines square and need an oblong 1. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to put together and move and I like the design. I bought it for the 2 layers so I could get some things off counter.",

It\u2019s kind of hard to get my plates in and out. Also the rack that holds the soap isn\u2019t big enough for a big bottle of dish soap so I just put my sponges in it.",

This was super easy to put together. Took about 10 minutes. Everything needed to assemble was included. It holds alot of dishes. (We are a family of four). We put the hooks on the front and use them for hanging the cutting board and such for drying. I was worried about the sturdiness because this one cost way less than some of the others I saw, but no need to worry at all. This is definitely worth the money! I am super happy I finally bought it.",

Las instrucciones f\u00e1ciles de llevar, f\u00e1cil de armar. Lleg\u00f3 con una bolsa abierta y vac\u00eda, quiero pensar que es donde estaban los tornillos, afortunadamente no falt\u00f3 ninguno.
