The function of this rack is not only over the sink dish rack, but also a cutlery holder, kitchen utensil holder, and a utility cleaning holder that can be used for cleaning supplies and brushes. Super sturdy and quick to put together, and Well packaged, no scratches or bend parts. At first, I was worry about the dimension of the product, sometimes it is incorrect with whatever adverting on the page. However, It freed up counter space and the black color matched perfectly to our kitchen. I was concern it wouldn\u2019t be tall enough for the shape of our faucet and the cupboards above but it fit perfectly.",

I had to fiddle with the connectors to get them to fit in the tubes. One of the legs was dinged when I took it out of the package.It looks nice in my kitchen. It is not adjustable (not sure why I thought it was). My sink is within the dimensions listed, but it doesn't fit on the sink frame nor straddle it. I had to secure a block under one leg for stability.That's a lot of complaints, but overall, I'm satisfied enough to not go through the hassle of returning it.",

Just be certain that you measure the distance for your sink facet. Mine just barely fit under the rack, but my facet has a hose/nozzle end so it wasn't a problem. A standard facet would have been an issue. Recommend this item for small kitchens with little countertop space. Great spacesaver!",
