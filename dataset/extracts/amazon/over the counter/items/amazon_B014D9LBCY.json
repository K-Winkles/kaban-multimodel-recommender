                "reviewText": "This thing is a BEAST! I purchased this because I have no oven in my apartment and wanted the option to be able to cook and this toaster oven does NOT disappoint. So far everyone that has been over to my place has complimented on how awesome it looks. Then I cook them some bomb food and they love it.The buttons are a little mushy and require a little more pressure then I find is necessary for a touch sensor button. Also the power cord is pretty short so make sure the outlet is close by or you'll need an extension cord. Two prong so no biggie.I've noticed that the toasting option doesn't visibly display a countdown to let you know when it's done. I've tried different options and can't seem to get a counter going. It does display a shading number though starting at 4 and then automatically shuts off when it has that shade. I think it does it in terms of quarters. So 4 is pretty much whole thing toasted. 3 = 75%. Etc. I usually stick with 3 since 4 sometimes overcooks just a little.Baking is a lot simpler. Set the temp, lights come on to tell you it's preheating. Lets out a chime when it's ready. From there it gives you an actual timer that you can feel free to set to your liking. Default is around 20 minutes or so. Just add or subtract however much you need. Lots of room in this behemoth. Doors stay open automatically once you've open the doors to their full swing. I saw another reviewer saying they shut on their own but that's not the case. Just open them up all the way and they'll stay open.The clock seems to work fine. Have noticed other people saying they've had issues with theirs but mine seems to be okay and I've had it for a bit now. Will update should anything arise.Overall, this thing is absolutely amazing.UPDATE 10/20/2021I'm noticing some other reviewers complaining about exploding doors and doors not staying open. I can comfortably say I've been using this toaster oven pretty much every day for 3 years and have not had a single problem with it. No exploding doors and the doors stay open as strong as they did 3 years ago. The only reason I can think of for the doors breaking is if you slam the doors shut or allow them to. If you repeatedly treat the toaster oven like it's your personal gimp, of course it's not gonna last. Just treat the oven well and it will last you as long as mine has.",

                "reviewText": "*Update*12/01/16: I've recently baked a brownie cake, a fruit pie, pork belly and a big spiral sliced ham in this toaster oven and they all turned out wonderful. The spiral sliced ham was a hit since it was a dish for our Thanksgiving get together, was so juicy and tender, not dry at all and there were so many compliments. We also baked a big slice of pork belly for two hours, the top was so crispy and bubbly brown while the pork meat was tender and juicy just like the ham, I wasn't expecting that so I was amazed. Still very happy with my purchase!------------I've been looking for a toaster oven for quite some time since I moved out. I almost settled for a toaster oven that was around $40 but realized that since I wasn't using my oven, that I needed a bigger toaster oven since I love baking and definitely wanted something with a lot of room to fit a 13x9 pan and so on. It took me about a week to receive this which was amazing because I was a dummy and waited after it almost sold out to buy one and was notified that it would take approximately 2 -3 months to ship to me. So I was really happy when Amazon notified me a few days later that I would receive it so much sooner.After I unboxed it and set it on my counter, I admired how nice it looked in stainless steel with its french doors which made it look so fancy. I read over the manual and then set the clock which was easy to do. The first thing that I cooked in this toaster oven was a rack of ribs split into two pieces that was marinaded, I used the aluminum pan that came with it and the ribs turned out amazing. I've only used the broil and toast function so far and am looking up ideas so I can use the dehydrate option. It's so easy to use it too, from choosing the function, setting the temp and timer to starting and stopping the cooking process, also love how it has a light inside when food is cooking and it does stay on the entire time until you turn off the toaster oven. Now I cook all sorts of things in this toaster oven, it's very roomy and gives me the light-bulb that I need to make and bake my own pizza.This toaster oven does create heat when in use and the outside does get hot so I just keep everything away from it. The cord is also short and I do wish it was longer but I use an extension cord to fix that. The inside is very easy to clean and so are the glass doors. I have yet to bake any sweets though because I haven't had the time and usually just cook dinner after work and such but Thanksgiving is coming and I need to start my pie practice so I will be baking some goodies real soon. I'm overall very happy with my toaster oven, absolutely love it and am so satisfied that I made the purchase and a big giant thank you to Amazon for shipping this out to me in a week instead of the 2 -3 months that I was told.",

Tener este horno en tu cocina suple perfectamente el tener un hornito, un horno normal, una tostadora dan y un grill.El tama\u00f1o es grande entonces caben dos pizzas chicas-medianas (no individuales). El color lo esperaba un poco mas plata pero es mas gris claro pero no es problema. Si estas viendo esto, compralo no te vas a arrepentir.",
