They initiated contact with me to try to make things right. I would definitely do business with them again.This item performs poorly. There is not sufficient slant to make it drain properly. It won't fit around some of the larger faucets. It description is deceptive. It shows the back of the splash guard folded up. It won't stay up unless it is resting against the wall behind the faucet (but the splash guard isn't deep enough to reach the wall. ) I bought a different splash guard & it is much more functional. It has an actual lip around it, and the water doesn't run off the back or the sides. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJQKKP83?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the few sink guards that had a back wall. I wanted this so as to not let water find its way behind the guard as easily. It's wide and deep enough that I can put a few small bottles of dish and hand soap on each side without it being cramped.This fit my kitchen sink spout well. I could have cut it a little wider, but I wanted a tighter seal around the hole so as to prevent water from sneaking though.I have yet to clean this thing, though I imagine even with its ability to help drain water that slashes, it should probably be cleaned once a month or so. For $10 bucks this gets the job done well.",

I have a craft kitchen in which the counter for the kitchen sink backs to a La Qutina window, so there is a space between the counter and the window to allow the window to open. I saw this and purchased it to keep water from going down the back of my counter. and it works like a charm.....since ther I have purchased 2 more for gifts for friends....",

I like that it's big, and goes end to end with my sink, but it doesn't have a slope or a gradient. things don't really drain well. It's cheap, only $10, so if you want something cheap you got it. But I don't recommend this one.",
