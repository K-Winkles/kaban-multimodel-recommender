It did have a slight vinegar smell, so I washed it with a cloth using cold water and a drop of dish soap on both sides, then rinsed well and dried with a clean towel. After it was completely dry, I used a new clean dry cloth and rubbed food grade mineral oil into the board on both sides and the side legs. Rubbed in well and it will protect the bamboo much longer. I only re-oil the board when it looks dry again. Always do this with all of your bamboo cutting boards & utensils. I never use hot water, I use cold or Luke warm with a drop of dish soap to clean the board.Please note: The photo of the board is darker because I took photo after I added mineral oil.",
