                "media_text": "Makes Cooking Meals More Enjoyable This versatile cutting board will certainly be your go-to when you're slicing and dicing, but it offers so much more than that. It's a multitasker that bridges gaps, like over dual sinks or that tiny stove nook (just ensure the stove's cooled down). Whether you're in a big house, tiny apartment or simply on the hunt for clever ways to maximize space, this board's always ready to offer that extra inch or shield your precious counters. Uniquely Designed to Hide Scratches No one likes to look at those unavoidable scratch marks that develop on a cutting board with frequent use. With our innovative acrylic cutting board, that's no longer an issue. Now, we can't make them magically disappear but we have the next best thing. The brilliant design features a smooth top, perfect for prepping, while the textured back quietly hides the scratches left behind by the knives. Larger Size for More Surface Protection Working on a small cutting board can be a pain in the you-know-what but dealing with one that's gigantic can be equally challenging. Our acrylic countertop cutting board is a perfect balance. It measures a manageable 24 x 18 inches (with a convenient 1.5-inch lip), giving you plenty of space to prepare food while providing some serious protection for your surfaces in and around the kitchen. Tools to Inspire Cooks of All Skill Levels Our top-notch culinary products are designed for everyone, whether you're taking baby steps or you've been at the stove for years. We're all about nudging folks to cook a bit more at home and save those restaurant trips for special occasions. Honestly, there's just something heartwarming about whipping up your own dishes. It feeds the stomach, sure, but it's also pure comfort food for the soul.",

While it's sturdy and all, please keep those piping-hot pots and pans away from it. Anything up to a warm 85\u00b0F? Totally fine. But scorching hot, let's not. Non-Porous, So It's Easy to Keep Clean Our acrylic board has a leg up when it comes to cleanliness. Unlike wood, it's less likely to trap all of that icky stuff. Cleaning's a snap, too - just a simple hand scrub with soap and water is all it takes. Plus, its sleek design and clarity mean that you might not be so eager to tuck away when you're not using it. Will Not Slide Around While You Prep A cutting board that is slipping and sliding all over your countertop is bad news. We made sure that won't be a concern with this one. Our cutting board comes with anti-slip silicone pads, ensuring it stays right where you want it. So, chop away with confidence and leave the sliding to your kitchen drawers!",

Not only is it larger than others that I have own but it's thicker and heavier, plus it has an underside of bubbles that hide any surface scratches on the top of board. The best feature is that the lip of the board is also thick and fits snugly against the countertop with the use of the included adhesive circles for mounting on board's underside, securing it from ever moving. I strongly recommend this product!",
