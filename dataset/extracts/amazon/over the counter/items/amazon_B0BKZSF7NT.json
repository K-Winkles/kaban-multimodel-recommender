We can't have many dishes and I needed something that would hold the clean dishes as well until we build cabinets and everything. It's perfect.Anyone who lowers stars based on basic dimensions that are clearly stated needs to invest in a tape measure. Luckily the bad reviews about how it must be made for a trailer or a dorm assured me it would be great. Also a tape measure confirmed that before I purchased it.Sorry for the mess in the pic.

I like the design, water drips in the sink now, as it should. my previous one spilled water on counter constantly. I also like that you have option to spill water on one of the 3 sides. the top rack is live saver.Not much to say here. stores lot of dishes and keeps the counter dry by dumping water in sink properly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my father (his request), and it does a great job, is sturdy, and easy to assemble, I'm not entirely sure if it's great for small spaces. The two tiers and side rack means it can hold more dishes, but that also means it's a bit awkward as you can't just simply slide it back on a counter if there's a cabinet above it, aside from that though he is enjoying the dish rack.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the X-Large. it's still fine for small places and works ok. My only complaints are the tray that collects water could be a little more inclined or slanted down because normal drops of water from the plates stay on the tray instead going towards the drain. The other issue the spout that emits out into he sink is too short. Third problem but not a major problem is that the second tier rack for plates it a little wobbly and super sturdy. If they fixed those 3 things it would be perfect.",

                "reviewText": "Fits all my plates and bowls on top and even larger/taller items on the bottom. I always had to turn my nutribullet tall cup on its side. I can easier turn it up side down and get it thoroughly dried. Same with tall cheese graters, and tumblers. The only thing that sucks is the utensil holder. It hold very few items, the side does hold additional knives but not well. The hooks work but only for smaller utensils like mini tongs/spatula.The cutting board rack works to hang however it shifts easily and since it's on my counter all the water from it just goes on there too.Overall though for $20 it works super well, and looks 10x better than all the other stainless steel/plastic ones.",

Only thing I don't like, is that the two addition racks on each end are easily bumped off. I was able to fix that with zip ties. So, no major problems. I let my bf pick this rack out and he is so happy with it that he actually does dishes sometimes. It's a win all the way around!",
