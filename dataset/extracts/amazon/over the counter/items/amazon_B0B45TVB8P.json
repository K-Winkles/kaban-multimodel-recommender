Either the cross bars would come out when a pan was placed on it, or they would start to rust a few months in. This silicone covered drying rack is so much better. Sanitary, I can easily disinfect it knowing there is no where it can rust! It dries perfectly as well and fits in a drawer if you don't want to leave it over the sink! We leave it, it matches our countertop really well!",

I would recommend it is quite sturdy as time go on I would see how long this remains the same.I would highly recommend it to assist in having additional surface or a drying area on your sink in the kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "Having used a couple different types of over-the-sink, roll-up dish drainers, I came to Amazon to find one that also incorporated a utensil holder. I was excited to see this model because: 1. It is totally silicone coated; 2. It has flat rather than round slats; and 3. It has a small, built-in utensil cup. The problem is, it is just 1/4\" too short to span our kitchen sink. I noted before purchasing that it is only 12\" wide, but I failed to consider the depth, thinking it would fit a standard sink. Alas, it doesn't. I would love if this company made a similar version of this same item that is just an inch deeper - then it would work for me and check all the boxes on my wish list.",
