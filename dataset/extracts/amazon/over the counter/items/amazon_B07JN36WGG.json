                "reviewText": "We bought 4 for our kitchen. No problems for delivery. All parts were neatly packed. Assembly was a bit tricky because the 4 legs on each chair are mounted independently yet tied together at the top under the seat and at the bottom foot rest. My suggestion is to not tighten any screws until you have the chair mostly together, then tighten them one by one slowly. Some times tightening one, will cause other to be too loose or too tight. Be patient and it'll be fine. Once assembled the chairs look beautiful! Nice material and very solid. Great height for our kitchen counter. Really nice for the price. Highly recommended.Update: there's stools are holding up well after a year. But, the bolts will back out with time. I highly recommend that you use Blue Loktite when you assemble the chairs to prevent this from happening.",

It didn't feel too sturdy to sit in, but it wasn't too bad and it sure looks pretty. The little foot caps to prevent scratching the floor immediately got stripped and left shavings of the cheap paint on my floor, though.When I tried assembling the second one, not all the screws would go in -- I screwed in the legs successfully (the holes on the second stool were even more unaligned than the first stool), the foot rest screws would remain loose and fall out, AND it scratched up the inside of the legs. When I started over and managed to tighten the foot rest screws, the inner screws on the legs would not tighten AT ALL -- flipped the stool around as a sanity check and 3 of the leg screws just fell right out.Wasted 2 hours disassembling and reassembling this one stool hoping to make it work, and clearly it's just not well-constructed. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk.",

                "reviewText": "When it said 26 inches, I assumed it meant from the floor to the top of the seat. But it's more from the floor to the top of the leg. The top of the seat is another couple of inches, so this stool is too high for my counter. I actually ordered it twice. The first time, I thought they accidentally sent me the 28-inch stools, so I sent them back, but the replacements are also measuring at 28 inches. I'm just going to hire a handyman to cut off a bit of the leg from the bottom. I'm disappointed because the second time I bought them, they were $25 more expensive, and now I'll have to pay even more for a handyman to get them to a usable height.Also, I'm a furniture assembling pro. Every piece of furniture I've ever bought, I assembled myself and love doing it. These were pretty difficult and frustrating because of the metal bar. Getting in place and holding it while trying to line up the screw is exhausting, and the legs got all scratched up in the process. One of the screw holes is a little wonky, too, so getting that one tightened was really tough.",

If you don\u2019t tighten the screws for the legs all the way, you leave enough slack for the footrest to slide easily in place. We did not have any issues with the holes lining up properly with that method. Once everything was in place we tightened all the screws and the stools are perfect! Total time for 4 stools was maybe half an hour.The quality of the stitching on the seats is beautiful. The stools look like I paid much more for them. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase.",
