The heads feel sturdy when moving them around, the paint feels to be of good quality. My husband was worried about the gold trim looking cheap and tacky, its totally the opposite, its really nice and gives them an upscale look. Overall it feels like a well built good quality light. We liked them so much that we might get one of the 3 light version in white to replace the guest bathroom light over the mirror. My husband liked that although they are really bright the light color is soft and it wont blind you.",

This is supposed to be dimmable, but I guess my switch box does not accommoate that. Otherwise, it's great, and seems to be a good value for the money. It looks sharp, and I really like the brass/gold accent inside the cans. I find it hilarious that one of the things it wants me to rate is \"suction power\". This light fixture has zero suction power. :D",
