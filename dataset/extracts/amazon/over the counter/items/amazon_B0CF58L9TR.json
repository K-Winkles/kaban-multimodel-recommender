Since the glass top needs to remain covered, at least I can use the top as more counter space This product is perfect for additional counter space",

                "reviewText": "Needed something to provide some protection after dropping a coffee cup and smashing the stove glass. Ugh! $400 down the drain. Size fits perfectly, looks nice, neutral gray color and easy to clean. I was a little sceptical, so I turned on the stove for about two minutes to check out how durable it was. Passed the smoke test! It buckled a little bit but returned to normal after it cooled. Many old folks, like me, drop stuff all the time. This helps a whole bunch. Absolutely worth it.",

Although, in time, I think I might because the feet will make it easier to move the piece as it goes on and off my stove. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of wood. There are many stove top covers out there, with many different price points. Maybe I\u2019ll get fancier in the future, but this piece is pretty, functional, and I\u2019m thrilled with it!! Add a ++ at the end of my 5 star rating! You won\u2019t, at least you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed if you purchase this \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f++",
