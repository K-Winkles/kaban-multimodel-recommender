                "reviewText": "I ordered this metal dish drying rack to replace an old plastic one I\u2019ve had for years. The plastic one has a very large footprint, and is only a single tier. This dish rack has a much more compact footprint due to it being two tiers, and looks much more attractive and modern.Assembly was fairly straightforward following the included illustrated instructions - took less than ten minutes including time to unwrap everything and review the instructions. The finished product is quite sturdy and stable, but as I mentioned in the title, there is one flaw - whether the glassware holder or the utensils holder is used, the one installed at the back of the rack hangs beyond the drip tray by about two inches and allows water to drip onto the countertop surface (pics). A larger drip tray would resolve this and the manufacturer should consider it for full functionality.The capacity looks good, easily fitting my plates and bowls with enough room for the blender jar and then some. The wireframe tiers seem strong enough to handle being fully loaded, and the base squares up and sits solid with no wobble.Overall it seems like a well made, functional (mostly) and modern looking drying rack. Taking into account the overhang and countertop drips, I\u2019d still recommend it with four stars.",

This really does the job and I like the color and it\u2019s metal and very sturdy. This is very thick material and rust proof so that is a big plus.It was very easy to put together, although you did have to put everything together. I found it very simple to do. The drainage function is really cool. I never had one with one of those. It was very easy to just put the pipe towards the sink so it drains right there. You have several options which direction you wanted to go. I definitely recommend this and I see it has a coupon right now so that\u2019s a really good deal.",
