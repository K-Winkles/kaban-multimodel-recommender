                "reviewText": "I LOVE this trash can and would highly recommend it. I searched through many similar products and returned one that was inadequate but this is just perfect. First of all the lid can be opened to hang down the back which gives a completely open top for inserting messy items, but then the lid easily swings back for a secure fit. This also comes with a scraper which is held in a very handy place. Thirdly it's easy to affix bags inside the can AND it came with two rolls of bags. Also it can affix or hang to your cabinets, be placed in side a cabinet or sit stably on the floor. It is sturdy but lightweight. Lastly, the price point was lower than many similar items. So I highly recommend this item!",

                "reviewText": "I never knew I needed a hanging trash can until I did! I have been spending a lot of time in our spare bedroom with our new baby to allow the rest of the household to get some sleep. I end up changing diapers in there and eating in there and just generally producing a decent amount of trash for a bedroom. So I wanted something in reach of the bed that I could dispose of things in with a lid to keep any odors contained. This bin mounted easily to the side of a desk I have by the bed using the adhesive clip and has been up there for some time now (often with heavy diapers inside), and it hasn\u2019t budged. It\u2019s easy to open both ways that it does (which is a cool feature btw) and seals nicely. I\u2019m so so glad I found this after browsing similar items for ages. It was the best deal by far and is a high quality product.",
