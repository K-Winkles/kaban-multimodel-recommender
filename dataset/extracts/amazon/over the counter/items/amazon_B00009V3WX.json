It did yeoman's duty for lo these many years then started sparking and catching fire inside. Well, how long are microwaves supposed to last these days, anyway? Whatever I expected, the fact was that I needed a microwave with the exact proportions and hardware. With some trepidation I check online. Thankfully Sharp still makes the exact same microwave! Could I have gotten a bigger or fancier one with more features? I don't know. This has inside and outside lights, settings for reheating and frozen foods and water. And it's really big inside for its size. Besides, what do you usually do with a microwave? You melt cheese and reheat soup and yesterday's stew. It works great and cleans up very easily. Plus it fits in the hole where the old one was. Perfect. By the way, it showed up in two days.",

                "reviewText": "I gave it 5 stars even though we've had a problem with it. We bought it to replace the dead 24\" over-the-range microwave in our motorhome. It was the only 24\" over-anything I found after hours of searching. We had to slightly modify the opening but the install fits perfectly.NOW the problem. I would NOT recommend this for installation in an RV even though it's the only 24\" model out there because, being 1100 watts, it draws 13 amps. If you are on a 30 amp service and have both A/C units on and you start the microwave you will either pop the shore power breaker or the main power fuse in this microwave will blow. (That is the voice of experience speaking.) It may be ok on a 50 service. We solve the problem by turning off the compressor on the back A/C when we want to use the microwave. Inconvenient but no more problems.",

Also, this is a somewhat unique size. Most installable microwaves are 30 inches, this one is only 24 inches so works well for small spaces.",

                "reviewText": "This Sharp replaced a 20+ year old 700 watt J. C. Penney/Panasonic convection/microwave oven which was the first kitchen appliance my wife and I bought together. We try to take care of our appliances, read the manuals, and follow the instructions; funny how that's consistently brought us good luck. I've been cooking exclusively on it for the past three weeks while we waited for our countertops in our kitchen rennovation and my Jenn-Aire has been disconnected. The only reason I'm giving the Sharp four stars instead of five is because I can make no real comment on its durability and longevity in three weeks, but its performance to date has been 5-star. I picked the Sharp over similar Panasonics because current production similarly sized and featured Sharps weigh 25 to 30 percent more than Panasonics; they seem more sturdy to me. I've owned several other Sharps for office and cabin use and have had no problems with any of them. After reading other reviews here, we did purchase an extended warranty along with the oven, although we live in an area with fairly stable mains electricity and we don't put stuff in the microwave that tend to wreck microwaves.The Sharp over the counter micorwave came well packed with all necessary mounting and hook-up accessories. Our cabinet installer was impressed with the mounting hardware, design and instructions. Final mounting was solid, flush and professionally \"built-in\". I've ordered the accessory bars and hooks for hanging some other kitchen equipment from the bottom of the oven.There have been significant power and feature improvements in microwaves. This Sharp O.T.C. works perfectly in our corridor kitchen rennovation and effectively gave me one third more useable counter prep space. While there are other microwaves for over the range mounting (incorporating exhaust fans we did not need), the Sharp was the only microwave I found with over the counter mounting and controls. The sensor cooking and reheat functions are easy to use and work very well. The automatic popcorn function leaves more \"old maids\" even on the \"more cooking\" setting, but popcorn popping is so fast that I just monitor it manually. Steaming vegetable and cooking rice is also quick and perfect. Reheating coffee and beverages is flawless. Door mounted controls are clear, intuitive, and lend a sleek and uncluttered look. Operation is fast and quiet. Built in task light illuminates what use to be the darkest corner of my kitchen quite adequately. Recommended.",
