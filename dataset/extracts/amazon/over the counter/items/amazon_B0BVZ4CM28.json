Yes, it gets a bit greasy when I am frying, but it comes clean with either a quick wipe or a quick wash if needed. I don't keep bottle in it, Just spices. I am amazed at how useful I find this. (If you have ever had a small spice jar fall behind your stove you will understand). This fills that gap between the stove and the backsplash so I don't have to worry about chasing those small jars anymore. It holds a lot and stays firmly in place. I will be giving a few of these out to my home cook friends.",

                "reviewText": "We live in a TINY apartment with very little storage, so for us, this was the perfect kitchen addition, and it was super affordable. These silicone \"shelves\" are really well made, NOT flimsy by any means, and the magnets are strong! Truly, you are NOT wasting your money on these. The 2 packs fits across the top absolutely perfectly! Order with complete confidence. I love them!",
