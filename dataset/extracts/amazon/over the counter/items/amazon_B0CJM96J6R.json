                "reviewText": "I ordered this because I have a limited amount of counterspace and didn't want to take up a lot of the useable area for a dish rack I don't always need. I have a dishwasher that does most of the dishes but I needed something I could use for the items I hand wash. Putting this together has a few moments where it was a little tricky mainly being the bars to attach the sides together. You have to get the inner pole out and situated in a way that allows you have the right amount of space for screw to secure it. There was no mention of these inner poles in the instruction or how to get them out so it took me a few minutes to realize they even were there. Once that got settled it was fairly simple to fully assemble. My next issue came when I went to situate it over my sink. I did not even think to measure the distance before ordering this so was a bit surprised that it wouldnt fit assembled the way it was shown. So I had to move some of the hanging pieces around which also took away some of the drying areas in order to get this to fit, barely.Now it is a solid enough build and can handle some weight as I use this for a lot of my heavier cookware. But I have to constantly pull it forward that way it's posting over the sink enough that the water drips there instead of all around on counter.",

                "reviewText": "I am so glad I got this drying rack. It has become so useful is more ways than I expected when I ordered it.I have a dishwasher but there are times, especially when I am cooking, that I want to wash dishes as I go, or at times I have more than what will fit in the dishwasher. Well, the most irritating thing when I do the dishes by hand is having that drying rack taking up so much counter space. So when I saw this I figured that would at very least free up some counter space. Well, it does do that and more. Its high enough and pushed back far enough it does not get in my way when working in the sink. There is so much room that I can wash a lot of dishes and they will all fit in it and I dont have to do a balancing act like I would with the counter one.The other use I found for it that I wasnt expecting is how useful it is for short term storage when I am gooking a big meal. I can create a sauce and need to set it aside and before hand I would have to just push it over and lose some counter space. Well after having a few dishes like this that I am preparing to all work together in recipe, my counter space becomes very sparse and very valuable. With this rack, I can put these dishes up and out of the way. It not only frees up counter space so i can continue working, but it also greatly reduces the chance I am going to hit one of those dishes with my arm and knock it on the floor. That part is really a saving grace.The material of the rack is very tough and sturdy. It does not wobble at all and the adjustable width let it fit perfectly across my sink. Not to small, not to large.I would highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I honestly have no complaints about this dish rack.Not only has it trippled my space avalable on my countertop but I no longer get the odd puddle on my counter from dishes drying.The rack itself is easy to assemble and incredably sturdy even fully extended as I have it.Some parts such as the cup drying bars don't work In my situation but that's souly because of the space I have avalable.The modularity and height of the rack itself has been a massive help to me keeping up with dishes as either my choices were before to lay out towels to add space or simply do many smaller loads at a time.I highly reccomend this for anyone with limited counterspace as this has been a massive help to me.",

There is a designated area for plates, cups & utensils. The rails seem to have strength & overall this will help us to have a better organized kitchen because of its spacious layout. I haven't put it over the sink as yet because we are doing repairs but it looks very good so far.",
