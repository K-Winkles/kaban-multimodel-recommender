Even in motion mode you can still use the hand wave feature. Nice brightness, very easy to install, and very strong and sturdy. Very good quality. For charging I recommend charging them at night while your sleeping or during the day. They do take a few hours to charge. Highly recommend these lights for anyone who is looking.",

                "reviewText": "Packaging is good. Features described work well. I like that it has a hand wave that will turn them on even in lit conditions. (Some will not light in auto if more than 10 lux). I like the three color modes and the variability control of the brightness. Also, the USB-C charging is a plus. However, max brightness is claimed to be 400 lumens, but both were not even close. Maybe they mean both lights together is 400 lumens, but even with both lighting at the same time, not bright enough for my pantry. (I have found other magnetic light bars to be able to light up the same area with a single device, even some shorter in length). If you don\u2019t need a lot of light, and the other features look good, should work well.",
