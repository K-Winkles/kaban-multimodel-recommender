                "reviewText": "When I first took this out of the box I thought it's going to be a weak cheap useless waste of money. It's not until you assemble it and you realize it's actually a quality product. Ounce built, it's study, and offers a lot of space for drying dishes. I'm able to put many things on it that use to pile up on my side sink dish rack. I like the storage for the soap bottles and sponge. The suction cups that hold it in place work well on my quartzite countertops. So far the coloring has not come off (been a few months now) and there's even a section that is set up for holding plates vertically to dry. There's also a utensil holder. You can resize it for different size sinks with adjustable thumbscrews to the max allowed in the specs. I still think for larger pots, pans and trays the side rack is needed. I can put some of my pots and pans on the rack securely enough but when I went to take my pan down from the top rack I dropped it on to my counter by accident. While no fault of the rack, it was potentially an issue for those who cannot grab such things lightly before taking them off the rack. It could cause injury if falls on that person OR damage the expensive countertops. I prefer to put these heavier items on the side rack now (again no fault of this rack) but more of a precaution. I've gotten use to having this extra space around the sink that I'll never be without it now. I highly recommend this product if you're looking to add some extra space around your kitchen sink.",

Normally you have a tray and rubber / plastic Matt that sits beside a sink and drains into it. But as time goes by it leaves water marks and doesn\u2019t stay put. While this is tall, it stays puts and drips directly into the sink, plus is offers storage spots for your soap, sponges etc etc. Was pretty easy to assemble, just make sure to measure your space and that it can fit over / around your sink faucet and handle.",

                "reviewText": "I love this rack. It was a little confusing to put together. Some parts are inside of others, so at first it seems like they are missing, but it turned out fine. I was able to adjust the width. It makes my kitchen look a lot better. I think it needed a vertical element. The frame is pretty heavy duty. The baskets are a little less so. I have had about 6 plates in it with no problem, but not sure if I will use for my cast iron pans, for example. However, in the interest of saving space, I will probably combine this with a roll-up over-the-sink rack for those items or things that are too tall for the space between the basket and the bottom of the cabinet above.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is great for saving space. We have an extra large faucet so I wasn't sure it would fit but with the adjusting shelves we made it work (sometimes the large faucet will still bump that middle shelf out of place when turning though). The sturdiness is concerning. We had to reinforce it by screwing it into our cabinets so it might not be renter friendly in this case. We had concerns about weight tipping it forward especially towards to top until we reinforced it. We had no trouble getting it to fit however our cabinet door swings outward so cup and anything on the edges can get knocked down if not careful. Some of the extra features are nice like the removable cup rack you can adjust around. The paper towel holder is very annoying because it doesn't have anything to secure the towel roll down so it slides off everytime you get any, we stopped using that feature early on. Same with the cutting board rack, it only holds a smaller cutting board, at least at the angle we have ours installed. I imagine if you have a deeper counter behind the end of the rack, it might not be an issue for you. However the overall space saving features are great and worth the purchase, just measure measure measure to make sure it will fit first. Assembly was a bit of a pain and took over an hour with just one adult. The parts were not labeled (not a huge deal for the accessories) and the rubber bits on the bottom kept falling out so much we had to resecure those too with our own materials.",
