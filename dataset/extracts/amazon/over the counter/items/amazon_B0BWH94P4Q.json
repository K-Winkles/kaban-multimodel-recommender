The instructions come as one piece of paper with vague instructions. If I didn't look at the product image on the listing here I probably would've never figured out the top basket. I was red hot angry crying at one point because it looked like I was doing it right but the basket would always fall if I tried to move an inch from the thing. Also mine came looking a little dirty in the utensil holder and I haven't been able to get it out even with a scrub daddy. The product itself is okay and seems to hold a lot but the draining tray is pretty flimsy. If you're a single household like me you shouldn't have a problem, but I don't know if it's big enough for a small family.",

The only down side is water drain holes started to plug up after a week, maybe because of hard water in our lines?! A quarter cup of diluted vinegar and water directly on drain holes cleared it up in seconds. Happy with this purchase!!!",
