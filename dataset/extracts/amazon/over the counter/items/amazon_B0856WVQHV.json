                "reviewText": "So happy to finally find one of these bad boys. My mother always had a Rubbermaid one in the 90s. Once I got my own place, I could not find so wound up with a large countertop version which was an eyesore and took up valuable space. A few years ago I searched again and best I could find was those bar things that go across your sink but meh. Lo and behold my search a few weeks ago found me this! The measurements were perfect and in my cart it went. It is sturdy and shiny and fits perfectly. I gained my countertop space back and this isn\u2019t an eyesore since it\u2019s somewhat hidden in the sink. LOVE IT! My only gripe is the larger opening on the one end that the small items I\u2019m trying to let dry, often fall out of and back into the sink. I solved it with 2 zip ties and so far so good (see pic). Just wish it wasn\u2019t there to begin with. Didn\u2019t deduct a star for it as it may work for someone else\u2019s needs but not for me. I mostly dry small Tupperware lids and containers that seem to never get fully dry in the dishwasher.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
