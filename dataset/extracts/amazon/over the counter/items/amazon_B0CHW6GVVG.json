                "reviewText": "My wife often has needed more room on the bathroom counter. I have seen her struggle many times with finding a place for the blow dryer, curling iron, makeup mirrors etc. In steps this product providing a place to set all the extras. It is made of a heavy silicone material that rolls out and rolls back up very easily. You might think it's placement over the sink would be an inconvenience with regards to accessing the sinks primary function. Not so; the product is designed so you can easily pick it up and move it out of the way with your extras still upon it.It's important for me to mention this actually fits over 1/2 of our standard kitchen sink way better than it fits over the sink in the bathroom.",

Sturdy enough to use as a prep area or put our smaller things like bag of bread/fruit/etc.Even a gallon of milk isn't too heavy.Rolls up into a storable item, fits in with the pots and pans or towels.Materials are kitchen-esque, happy enough with everything.",
