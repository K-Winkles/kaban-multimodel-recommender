                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Hearing Amplifiers But Just Not True Hearing Aids...",
                "reviewText": "As Hearing Amplifiers go I didn't find anything that would make me not like these hearing devices by Audio Basics. Based on their current technology I would consider this a fair price for a set of entry level hearing amplifiers. The sound is good and the fit I found to be very comfortable. Their extended battery life and it rechargeable carrying case makes it a great feature to travel with. Also most sellers do not include a charging cube that plugs into your wall outlet and allows you to plug in the USB Type C charging cable for their charging case but this seller does. I also really liked their manual since most sellers for these types of hearing devices usually print their manuals in tiny print and very little pictorial descriptions but I found this manual from Audio Basics to be easy enough for even us elderly to enjoy reading without having to use a magnifying glass. Let's face it you will find their controls very easy to understand and even easier to use to turn the amplifiers off and on as well as select your hearing mode and the volume level that works for you...Since I've been wearing true hearing aids for over 10 years I believe I can recognize the good and bad issues with these amplifiers. The first thing I did after reading through their manual was to remove the tape on the bottom of the amplifiers, reinsert them into their charging case so I could get them fully charged with the supplied USB Type C charging cord and charging cube. When all of the blue lights on the charging case quit flashing you know that these devices have been fully charged along with the case. The only issue I had was that the sound clarity was good but not great but for an entry level set of amplifiers these turned out to be better than most that I've tested over the past year. I also couldn't perceive any real difference between their regular hearing mode and their noise reduction mode but since most of my time that I spent using them was in my living room while watching TV or in a conversation with my wife in our home or in our automobile maybe I wasn't putting it to a true test as far as background noise goes...These amplifiers are what most would label as PSAP's (personal sound amplification products). These hearing amplifiers are sufficient for helping the elderly with mild to somewhere below moderate hearing loss. True hearing aids amplify only certain sounds based on your hearing profile, but PSAPs amplify all sounds equally so if you use these aids to assist you with your hearing loss just be sure to start your volume level at the lowest level possible that offers a benefit to your hearing because if you crank them up too loud it may sound good at first but you will probably, over time, lose what good hearing you have left...If you're not looking to pay thousands for true hearing aids then these hearing amplifiers would definitely assist you with your everyday conversations with your family and friends along with being able to sat down in front of the TV and listening to your favorite shows with your family without subjecting the family to overly loud programs just to allow yourself the pleasure of listening to the program due to your poor hearing. Audio Basics has provided you with a means of filling the hearing gap between you and the rest of the world for very little investment on your part...",
