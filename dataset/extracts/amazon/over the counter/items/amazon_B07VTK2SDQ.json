                "reviewText": "I am allergic to red dye. When I came down with a cold/ sinus thing in early 2022, I had a hard time finding a medication that didn\u2019t have red dye in it. I also can\u2019t process sugar so if I found a medication without red dye, it inevitably had sugar. This product DOES NOT HAVE RED DYE or SUGAR!! It worked really well. I was able to go back to work and everything cleared up quickly.",

                "reviewText": "But when nothing I had in my natural medicine cabinet eased the horrible flu symptoms I had for a month and a half recently, I surrendered and bought this. The first night I took this I finally slept through the night. I kept taking these at night and when I felt body aches coming on, which was sporadic. This helped tremendously every time I took this. I hate all the chemicals and lab-made food coloring this stuff has. I wish they didn't have to add all that toxic stuff. It's so unnecessary.",
