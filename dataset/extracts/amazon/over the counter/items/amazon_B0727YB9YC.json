There was nothing wrong with the old ones, but I thought the black would be less conspicuous than the stainless steel ones. They come folded, so getting them to lay flat and getting the piece on the bottom to sit between the stove and counter took some time and patience. However, the next day, the fold crease had flattened out and they were well situated. They don't move around like the stainless steel ones did. Since they are silicon, they \"stick\" in place. They are a little harder to clean than the stainless, because the dish cloth doesn't run over them as smoothly as it does over metal. But they come clean and that's what really matters. These gap fillers really do help to keep food and drips from falling between the stove and cabinets, which can otherwise only be cleaned by moving the unit out. Measure first to make sure you get the right size. Good product!",

                "reviewText": "The silicone stove counter gap filler has its pros and cons. On the positive side, it effectively fills the gaps between the stove and the counter, preventing crumbs and spills from falling into hard-to-reach places. The silicone material is also easy to clean, which is a big plus for maintaining a tidy kitchen.However, I found that the fit was not always perfect, and it tended to shift or move over time. Additionally, the color options were limited, and it didn't exactly match my kitchen decor. While it serves its purpose adequately, there is room for improvement in terms of design and durability.In summary, the silicone stove counter gap filler gets the job done but falls short in some aspects. If you prioritize functionality over aesthetics, it could be a practical addition to your kitchen.",

I had a metal gap cover that was horrible and didn\u2019t stay in place and it didn\u2019t go around the back of the stove to the wall. It was useless and it didn\u2019t look good. But this is great.
