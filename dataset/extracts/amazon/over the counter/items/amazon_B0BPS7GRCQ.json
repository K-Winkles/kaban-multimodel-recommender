I had never seen a drain board with this little spout and this one has it! It drains right into the sink instead of just sitting stagnant. It's super sturdy (not cheap-made) and easy to assemble.",

You can only put a cup on every other slot. They were not spaced out, but everything else on here is great. I love this dish rack, it keeps the water off my counter. It even has a draining slide to go straight into my sink. It looks great in my kitchen and honestly it doesn\u2019t take up that much room on my counter, but it holds a lot of dishes. I do not have a dishwasher, so this is been a game changer And I no longer have to play dish Jenga.",

I love the way the drain is adjustable and empties into the sink. The sturdiness criticism comes from the cup holder. I wish it had some sort of snap to hold it in place better. It falls off easily if there is nothing in it, and I'm afraid if it gets bumped while holding cups, it will break. So, I'm not a big fan of the detachable cup holder. Otherwise, this does a great job and I really like the knife holders.",

So I\u2019m ok with the price. No retuning something. I have returned so many things this year because items were broken, missing parts or were garbage. So this is a large and sturdy dish rack. It\u2019s big enough for a family of dishes. Love the knife holder and how many items can fit without it collapsing, Drain spout is nice. I live in a house that was built in the Stone Age so this rack helps me by utilizing my small counter space so I can cook and stack my bowls and stuff so they\u2019re out of my way,I\u2019m happy with this purchase and rambling :)",

                "reviewText": "This is clever and someone put a lot of thought into it but it's a little over engineered and rickety. The plates: in the photo fit in it pretty well but yours may not.The rotatable drainage trough seems to work pretty well. You have choices as to where to place the rack next to your sink.The drain pan extention may not work that well, and the silverware rack is a bit challenging.The knife rack may not drain at all. You have to empty it later.You can use the different components separately such as putting the dish drying rack in the sink. I can see doing that while you let the pots dry in the regular rack.I'm keeping this as a back up for clean up after large dinners.I also bought the large, expandable Kitchen Aid drying rack and seem to like it better. It's big and simple and easier to wrap your brain around.",

                "reviewText": "I placed ours vertically instead of horizontally on our counter and it fits perfectly, and because it's not that wide, I was able to free up a little extra counter space too. When you first open up the box, it looks like there are a lot of pieces but there really isn't. I opted not to use the cup thingy. The sides are a little low so I had to get used to stacking dishes a slightly different way, but other than that, it's been working out great for my household. After reading some other reviews, I tested out the drain spout by pouring multiple cups of water over the basket but it never leaked on me. Sometimes it will drain, then slow down and then drain some more which is funny to look at but everything has worked as described. It doesn't mention it in the description but the extendable part interior is on a slant which forces the water to not be stagnant which I like. And you can't really tell from the product pics but the utensil holder has drain openings on the one side so you don't have to worry about water staying inside the holder. I wish it came in a more glamorous color than black but that's just me being picky. Besides it fitting my counter completely how I like, I think my favorite feature is that the inside part doesn't have huge wire racks. It allows me more freedom to use that space without wires getting in my way. I can still stack plates and lids if I want but with the lower interior, I can put my pots and pans however I want.",
