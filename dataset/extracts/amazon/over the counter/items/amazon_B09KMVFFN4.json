                "reviewText": "No assembly instructions provided - there's little notches at the corner and edge of each shelf, where the verticals of the two metal sides slot/snap into; they rest on the horizontal part of them near the bottom, on the bar just below the top, and any other pair of horizontal bars in between (the middle one, as shown). I found it helped to tip the outer edge of the shelves up to get them into their spaces, then push them down into position, once the bottom shelf was on and I had to do both sides at once.I got it to use in the bathroom, as we haven't got nearly enough counter space for how many of us share the one sink. We got lucky: the cream shade of the plastic shelves actually matches our marble sink/counter perfectly, and it's the perfect size for the available space, so it looks decent in here - but the plastic shelves aren't going to win any awards for beauty. In a kitchen I'd go with an all metal or wood shelf model instead, and in a bathroom that isn't cream/beige, I wouldn't go with this one even if you go for plastic.Probably less an issue with spices, but in the bathroom, many taller products (mouthwash, some facial cleansers, hairspray) don't fit between the lower shelves. I might try moving the middle shelf up a \"rung\", if we find we need more room for that taller stuff, but fortunately we all seem to be using hair goo that comes in tubs, and those can stack 3-4 high between shelves no problem.Bottom line: I can now use the sink without knocking things off the counter or moving them first. It fits where I wanted to put it, and does what it needs to. In MY bathroom, it looks pretty good, but I would only recommend it for a similarly colored space.",

                "reviewText": "My home was recently renovated & the tension rod corner shelf I had been using for years on my sink no longer fit so I had to find an alternative. I\u2019m very partial to my tension rod corner shelf so it\u2019s been hard to find something suitable. This is the 2nd shelf I bought & it\u2019s the next best thing to my beloved tension rod corner shelf. The other shelf I bought (not this product or company) was too big & bulky. Anywho it\u2019s a great space saver nonetheless. I\u2019m still going to have my husband try to rig the tension rod back onto the sink counter but that\u2019ll probably take a couple of years to get him to come around to it so until then I\u2019m rocking this shelf",

There were no assembly instructions but thankfully I am pretty good at putting things together. I did struggle a tiny bit to snap the shelves onto the metal parts but I did finally figure it out. When it was all put together, it felt quite sturdy. It wasn't wobbly or loose. I put it on my bathroom counter and put bottles of vitamins, pain killers, etc., on it and it held up. Overall, I'm happy with this shelf even though it's overpriced.",
