It was pretty easy to assemble, just follow the pictures and make sure you have all the tools and screws, and that the holes have been drilled in all the right places. Some holes might be slightly off, I put the screws in and aligned it with the rack parts and that helped a lot with assemblage. Overall it didn\u2019t take too long, looks nice, functions as it should and worth its price.",

So it\u2019s easy to wipe and clean. The colour is just perfect for the coffee area set up I was aiming for.
