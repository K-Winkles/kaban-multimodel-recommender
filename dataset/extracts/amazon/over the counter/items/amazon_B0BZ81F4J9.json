                "reviewText": "Do not buy these lights. They do not work as advertised. The motion sensors on both do not work when installed under the cabinet with the light facing down. The battery does not last long so forget using them as night lights. Every time they have to be charged, the light must be removed from their magnets, charged, and then put back onto the magnets which are not strong enough. Very frustrating product. I am not returning them simply to avoid the lights being repackaged and sold again to the next unsuspecting customer. So whoever that might be, you are welcome.",
