How long it\u2019ll last I don\u2019t know, I really only needed it for the week and for that time it worked great, fit perfectly over her apartment sink, let the few dishes I used dry quickly, was sturdy enough for a heavy dinner plate and glass\u2026 glass. I never worried it would collapse under the weight and break her dishes. It didn\u2019t rust. It rinsed, dried, and rolled up again easily for transport home and doesn\u2019t take up a ton of space that way, so it was easy to tuck it into a corner of a cabinet for next time I may need it. I\u2019m thinking I might pull it out for the holidays when there\u2019s always a ton of extra pots and pans around, and use it on the washing side of the sink when everything\u2019s clean and just needs to dry.",

When I'm not using it, I can conveniently roll it up and store it away, which is great for my small kitchen.Not only is it super functional, but it's also easy to clean. I can quickly wipe it down or even throw it in the dishwasher. This has made my dishwashing routine so much more efficient.I would highly recommend this over the sink drying rack to anyone looking for a space-saving, easy-to-clean solution for drying dishes.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little on the fence about this product, but I'm glad I made the purchase, it has become a permanent fixture in my sink and I've used it every single day since I bought it. Simple and effective, it allows your dishes to dry over the sink, just as advertised.One thing I have considered is bacteria transfer from the kitchen sink, and the possibility that my dish soap water is splashing back up to the dishes resting on the rack... The thought makes me just a little bit squeamish, but in truth, most drying solutions will suffer from the same issue (being close to the sink) and we do have immune systems for a reason. ;D Maybe not the best pick for germaphobe, but practical and effective for the rest of us.",

                "reviewText": "I've used every other design besides this one until now (the side sink rack with drainers, the microfibre matts, etc.) I recommend this design over all of them. Just measure your sink and what will fit and you're good. I saw an \"expandable design\" as well so if you ever move and end up with a bigger sink, viola!(I under-measured and wish I got a bigger one. My mistake was thinking the faucuet/dishwasher compoennts on my sink would get in the way - it doesnt. This is a very studry product that doesn't need much \"ledge\" to hold just great.)Now my dish washing is so easy and efficient. I was inefficient before without it b/c I woudl tend to wait until I had a whole dishwasher load before i washed/dried and put in the dishwasher. But that meant things i use daily (like my water shaker bottle for my nutrient/protein drinks) would sit there and do a \"need now\" wash with a semi-full sink of dirty dishes (but not enough to run a full dishwasher load).This rack has freed me to wash my daily things and dry them, even while i'm waiting to run a full dishwasher load. (The other thing i was running into was using the dishwasher as the dryer rack, but then i'd get confused which i washed already for next use vs waiting to be washed with a full dish washer load).yes.. i have to keep it super simple at my age. But this allows me to easily and visually know what's what. it's been much more of a game changer for me than i expected in my situation.",
