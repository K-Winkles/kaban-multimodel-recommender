                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not designed for standard American interior doors",
                "reviewText": "This over-the-door rack of shelves is definitely heavy duty! Because all the weight-bearing parts are strong metal, it can handle a LOT of weight. I was pleased that both the shelf sides and bottoms are sturdy metal. The clear plastic fronts have supports only on the ends, but are protected from being bowed out in front by a metal lip on the front of the shelf bottoms that restrains contents. I like that they are clear so you can easily see shelf contents, too. There are no backs on the shelves, so your door acts as the back, so you have to keep this in mind when filling them.This unit took longer to put together than it should have. The instructions lack a few details. For example, they don't call attention to the two support pieces that are finished on the bottom, which go on last. There is also no mention of why two of the \"adhesive pad screw disks\" have longer screws, so don't screw all the way in, nor is anything said about the two screw caps, which don't seem to belong anywhere. I also ended up with THREE extra discs. There were a number of extra holes where I could have used them, but they were all too large. I'm usually pretty good at this kind of simple assembly, but had to fight inserting one shelf into its slots for over 10 minutes. The slots were on either side of a junction. The rest were fine. When assembling this, getting the screw discs really tight makes a difference in stabilizing the two supports.As far as improvements I would appreciate go, the first would of course be either a way to adjust the spacing on the hook at the top, or to have it fit a standard interior door without all the overhang. It's nearly 2\" wide on the inside, and my standard door measured 1 3/8\". Second, when attaching the rack to the door, having something like a 3M removable tape strip would be so much nicer, since it would not cause damage when removed. Third, having more slots (where the shelf hooks attach) that are spaced a little closer would have enabled me to use all 6 shelves rather than just 5.Other than those considerations, this is a strong unit that holds quite a bit, and at the current price seems to be a good buy as well.",

                "reviewText": "Item: DAOTENGQL 6-Tier Over the Door Pantry OrganizerPrice: $29.99We've just added-completed a small walk-in pantry in our kitchen. I\u2019m using Amazon vendored and independently standing 12-inch deep metal-wire shelving units. This provides good storage capacity for larger boxed and bagged items and flexibility in moving the storage units around. But those shelves are deep, and the only available wall space I have left required a wide (16-inch) system, but also shallow, like under 6-inches. This so we could have room to work our large item storage on the opposite wall.I\u2019m going to mount this unit directly to an un-used wall section in the new pantry. The minor modification I\u2019ll be making is to delete the \u2018over the door\u2019 clips. I\u2019ll be fastening the rails to the wall directly. In my humble opinion, it would have been great if the manufacturer had made the \u2018over the door\u2019 feature \u2018included but removable.\u2019 Then there'd be an option to either direct mount to a wall or \u2018hang on a door.' That, in my opinion, would allow changing the installation without having to do any 'physical reworking' of the unit.As an organizer I found that it\u2019s actually fairly priced. Had I purchased six individual containers of the same size and then used wall-mount hardware, my expense would have been greater than the storage unit\u2019s current price point. So for me, this was certainly a good value item.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this to use on the back of my linen closet door. It is somewhat useful, but not as much as I would have hoped. The instructions were terrible. I lucked out and randomly put the support bars together in the right order. I have finally figured out what the different lengths of screw on adhesive disks are for, but of course I did not put them where they needed to be. The longer ones can go in any slot using the little metal cap to secure them to the supports. This will take care of the issue with door panels being uneven, as they can be put in numerous different positions to account for sunken surfaces where the normal connection point is. With only two long \"accessories,\" I cannot affix it securely because of where my door panels are, as I would need four (standard US door). I am actually afraid to use their adhesive, anyway, as I do not want to take the chance of it not coming off without damage (no information is given on that). The hooks at the top are also much bigger than my door, and stick out a fair bit into the hall. It is adjustable in that you can choose to put the shelves in multiple places, but the supports are too short to give viable options. I need one shelf a little taller to fit spray bottles, so that means another shelf can only hold extremely short things. It really needs one more extension on the supports to make it truly adjustable and useful. The shelves are thin metal with an acrylic front piece. Some of mine were already a bit bent up when I got it. There is a slight gap at the back because it cannot fit flush with a paneled door.",
