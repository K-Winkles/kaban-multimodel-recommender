                "reviewText": "I was very excited about this. I have no counter space. What you see is what I have. This is such a wonderful space saver.I bought this version because it has a paper towel holder. Plus I liked the curved legs instead of the straight, boxy version.Pros: Space saver, easier to organize dishes and other items, it looks nice, it's sturdy, it doesn't slip, it's fairly easy to assemble (I suggest a helper to hold one side), you can move attachments around, it is adjustable, your faucet should fit, even if it comes up between the baskets on the top, lastly, this one has a paper towel holder!Cons: It has a few down points. Such as the drips falling into your sink and some on the back of the sink. It can drip on you when you're doing dishes a little. But it's a minor inconvenience if you need space. Cosmetically, unless you have all matching dishes it can look like clutter. Because it's a focal point when you walk in the kitchen. But only slightly worse than dishes piled up in a drainer on the counter! I had an issue with placement of the cup holder, silverware holder, and the cutting board holder. I have cabinets on both sides so the cup holder had to go on the inside due to no room. My counter space didn't work quite right for the cutting board holder. Luckily, they are movable and I was able to make them work. I have also heard from some that these can rust over time. I'm not sure about that yet. But so far, so good.All in all, it was a wonderful purchase and worth the cost!",

                "reviewText": "All is good except the glasses wont stay on the part for glasses. Its pretty much useless except maybe for hanging a towel to dry on. Wish they would improve that part. Another thing is that i have to lay numerous different dishtowels underneath behind, & under each side of the sink because water dripping off of dishes lands mostly on the counter that next to the sink. However the rest of it is really awesome. And saves a ton of counter space! I would never go back to my old dish drainer! The part that holds my cutting board is so great that its turned into my new place to store it permanently! I like the black color too! It goes great w the new back splash my landlords put in.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit worried to buy this at first with concerns of stability and size. The pics made it look small but I promise it's huge. There's a basket for plates and a separate basket for bowls. A cup organizer that i wouldnt recommend putting glasses on but plastic and lighter cups are fine, a knife and silverware holder. The added paper towel holder is added bonus. May come off easy if you pull the towels but i love that it keeps my roll off the counter! I love it! It fit my 33 inch double sink snuggly. Great quality and an easy build. The price is right! Works great for my family of 3.",

Wish I'd had this years ago. It was delivered from Amazon timely. There were easy to follow picture instructions included in the box, along with a couple tiny tools and one extra each of the hardware used to connect the pieces. It took less than 10 minutes to put it together. It seems pretty sturdy. I love the paper towel holder and the cutting block holder. I wish someone made extras of the baskets and accessories that could be used interchangably, based on your needs. At least, I haven't found them yet. I am super satisfied with this purchase.",
