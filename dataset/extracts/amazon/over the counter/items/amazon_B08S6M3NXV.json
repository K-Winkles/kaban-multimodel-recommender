                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Great affordable product! I love using this product when I only have a few dishes to wash, and I can just let them dry on the roll-up drying rack. It keeps my countertop space nice and clear since I used to put a towel down and let the dishes dry on the towel (before I bought this drying rack). I can place wine glasses upside down on the rack without having them tip over. I haven't placed anything too heavy on the rack yet, so I am not sure what the weight capacity is, but it holds cups, mugs, wine glasses, bowls, etc. very nicely!It rolls open and close easily and is aesthetically appealing! It is easy to clean and easy to store. I bought a second one of these for my sister-in-law to give to her for Christmas...I think she will enjoy it!",

                "reviewText": "This rack has become my absolute favorite, and I use it almost every day. When my larger rack is full, this one comes in handy. It's not limited to just utensils; I also use it to dry vegetables, fruits, and more after washing. With some large mugs in my collection, the regular dish drying rack from Walmart takes up a lot of space, leaving little room for other utensils. However, the roll-up rack has made my life so much easier. I love how I can place my mugs on it after washing, and they dry up quickly. The airflow from both ends ensures that the insides dry up rapidly as well. While I can't guarantee it fits all sinks, it fits well in my standard-sized sink. Cleaning it, especially the crevices, can be a bit of a task at times.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised that I can utilize this rack for a few different things. Drying dishes of course, but also washing fruit and veggies easier, using a colander more easily, just set it on the rack instead of using another dish to dirty to catch water, less splashing of dirty water on food/dishes, less food wastage. Also it helps us personally keep up on dishes more. If we keep it up we fill up 1 side of the sink quicker, but then was them sooner, but not feel stressed that I only have 1 sided of the sink....the other clean sided is always there if needed. The lenght was a good fit and rubber edges really help slipping of rack, even with our tight spaced faucet. Time will tell how it holds up with use and water.",

It has been a really useful little thing I was quite shocked I got the smallest size because I like to have an opening into the sink I would totally recommend it it's one of those things you didn't know you needed until you have one but I knew I needed it or thought from the reviews that I would most likely agree and I do.",
