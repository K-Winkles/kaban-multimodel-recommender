During maintenance, do not scratch the surface of carbon steel, and do not use the steel wool or bleaching detergent for cleaning. 2. If there is a lot of dust on the surface, you can use weak detergent to clean it to protect the carbon steel from being damaged. If you accidentally leave grease stains on the surface, you can wipe it with a soft cloth and then clean it with a neutral detergent to ensure a beautiful effect. 3.

It came disassembled but took less than an hour to put together. My only feedback is the video you watch that shows assembly needed better centering & longer views on the parts before adding. However, it was not difficult (& I am NOT mechanically inclined at all).I have a cabinet in the right side of my sink so my advice is to be mindful of anything on the upper end that may limit room for this item. It ended up working out!There\u2019s room for 3 stemmed glasses to dry.I\u2019m very happy with this item in general! It\u2019s given me an entire counter to use, which prior held dish towels and dishes.It\u2019s a great price and feels sturdy!Photos include empty and with a few dishes to show how it functions in real life.",

                "reviewText": "If you follow my reviews you know I recently moved, and my kitchen design had been a challenge. Limited cabinet space in particular.I didn't purchase this for what it's designed for at least not just that purpose.I organized the dishes that I regularly use on this rack so they're always accessible. I use them, clean them, and put them back on the rack. This freed up a whole cabinet for other cooking supplies I needed to store.Everything is at my fingertips now, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, cleaning products, etc. It is working exactly as I imagined, so I'm super happy!This was easy to assemble. The suction on the legs doesn't really work, but it's positioned so it doesn't slip.These tray are truly strudy. I was initially worried about my plates and bowls. This is a pretty heavy dish set, but the trays are holding up perfectly, and not giving me any reasons yet to worry.The glass holder I had to play with, and never really got it right. It doesn't really hold 4 regular size glasses. I have two regular and two small and it's still not perfectly secure. To address this issues I was able to positioned my other organizers right next to it, so it keeps the glasses secure and ensures they don't tip over-- if yours has no support just be careful or put less glasses on it.My cups are a little small, so they fit perfectly.The knife rack is odd, none of my knives really fit, but I made it work. Again this keeps things I regularly use right at my fingertips, and I don't have to go searching for them in a drawer.I still have a few unused hooks, so this is very efficient. Got this one on sale, so super great value in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what we needed. Cleared so much space for us. We didn't use some of the attachments due to where our cupboards sit or had no use for. It is quite sturdy when assembled and in place. (Watch the video instructions to make your life much easier during assembly. Made it easier to understand the picture instructions).It did have one scratch on a bar but very minor. I also found the suction chips did best with a bit of moisture on them then pressed firmly. Very impressed they included extra suction cups as well!The only note I would mention is that they advertise being able to hold plates and bowels and cups in the top tracks but I found the inner corners sagged and this has probably led to the complaints in other reviews. I didn't have plans to put that up there though so it is no issue to me. I put tupperware lids and small hard to dry plastic items in the baskets. See my pictures. The knife holder needs a review by the company as the slats are easy too big for knives to sit in it. They slide right through the top.Those are the only two notable mentions and drew off 1 star in sturdiness. But as I said it didn't affect my use. Really good price and fast shipping.",
