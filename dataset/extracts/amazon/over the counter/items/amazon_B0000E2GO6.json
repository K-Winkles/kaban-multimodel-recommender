        "description": "Product Description A fusion of artistry and functionality: Our knives and kitchen tools are created for expert chefs and home culinary enthusiasts alike. With designs as diverse as the professional and household needs we supply, Lamson products are at once high-performing and stylish, traditional and innovative. As we move toward a third century in a business we\u2019ve long exemplified, our mission remains steadfast: to aim for nothing short of American-made perfection. Amazon.com This silicone countertop cover offers a resting spot for hot pots to keep Formica or Corian safe from melting or blistering. However, it also protects counterops from scratches; prevents mixing bowls and cutting boards from sliding during use; and functions as a pot holder, jar opener, and garlic peeler. Measuring 11-1/2 by 11-1/2 inches square, this trivet provides a large surface area that can fully cover the bottoms of most round or square casserole dishes. The silicone material is heat-resistant to 675 degrees Fahrenheit so heat won\u0092t transfer through the cover and a patterned surface keeps the trivet from slipping or sliding on any counter surface. This counter cover is flexible enough to roll up and store compactly in a drawer or has a hole in one corner to hang from a hook. This product is dishwasher-safe.--Cristina Vaamonde",

                "reviewText": "I just spent $7k on new quartz countertops and needed a silicone mat to protect them from the heat produced under my air fryer. I watched countless YouTube videos of people's air fryers causing their quartz countertops to crack. I was looking for something thicker than this model, but this is the only one that was the right size. My air fryer max temp is 400 degrees and this is rated to 450 degrees, so it does the job.",

                "reviewText": "We looked in the big box stores for a high-heat silicone mat to place on our countertops. Not finding what we wanted, we checked on Amazon. The description of this silicone mat and the size seemed perfect for our new Air Fryer. This was the perfect size for the Air Fryer and am now using it under my Instant Pot. The mat is easy to clean, easy to move forward when using appliance, and easy to clean. What an assurance to know that this mat will also protect our counter top from higher temperatures. This is a quality product that I would definitely purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "This product is excellent quality and I've ordered quite a few more. It is perfect for the countertop to save from burns and scratches. I have the smaller size, but these work so much better if you are using them as a counter-saver. They are thick and heat-resistant and even large pans will fit on a single trivet. I used them to line my counters when cooking for the holidays and moving hot things in and out of the ovens. I use them every day.",

                "reviewText": "Nice deep color, the raised \"bumps\" on this silicone mat separate your hot cooking vessels from the table or counter tops. I purchased mine for Sous Vide cooking because I never felt very safe putting my large pot of hot water on an overturned baking pan... many people suggest the low (maybe 3/4 inch) sided baking sheets flipped over can be used for Sous Vide, but 1) It's not pretty and 2) The metal to metal contact between baking sheet and stainless steel pot is not secure if I should accidentally bump into it. It's a small price for a daily use item even if you don't have all the time in the world for Sous Vide cooking. You can use it to protect your surfaces when pulling any hot pan out of the oven or off your stove, or, if you are like me, any one of your Ninja cooking appliances.",
