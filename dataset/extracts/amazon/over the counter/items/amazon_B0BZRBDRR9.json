I would say the water drains out pretty well there are a few spots where it lingers. It has plenty of space and fits while still fitting nicely on the counter top. If I had to change anything it would definitely be the cup drying rack the hooks on the front side. It doesn't stay hooked on the rack well and you can only utilize some of hooks at a time unless you have very slim glassware. All in all It is a good purchase for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This strainer has an enormous amount of room for all kinds of dishes and is sturdy enough to handle the weight of heavy pots and pans. I like the somewhat industrial/farmhouse look and color. The ONLY improvement I would make is that the lip on the water collector is a little close to the counter level so that if you have a drop-in sink the water doesn\u2019t always drain and remains in the collector. However, slightly tilting the collector solves the problem and there are no leaks on the counter tops.",

The only downsides are that a number of the elements hang over past the bottom pan, so it does end up dripping on the counter. And the place to hang glasses, glasses end up falling off (but it is perfect for pint plastic containers!). It\u2019s simple to put together and clean and fits my space that has a cabinet right above. I\u2019m glad of this purchase because of how much it holds, I recommend if you\u2019re like me and procrastinate washing dishes.",
