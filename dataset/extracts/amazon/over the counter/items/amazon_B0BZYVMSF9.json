We have some small jars that fit just fine under it and the distance from the shelf to the underside of our overhanging cabinets is just great for other kitchen bottles like grapeseed oil, a tall pepper mill, etc. It works exactly for what we need. No problems.",

They look great, they were easy to put together, they are multifunctional, and work for many different things you need to organize. The instructions say you need a bunch of tools to put them together, but you ONLY need the Allen wrench that they provide!! Lol",
