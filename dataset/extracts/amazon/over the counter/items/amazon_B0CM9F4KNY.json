The width is not as wide as previous one, but holds as much and allows to get our hand down into the sink area. The less than desired feature is the slits for plates is too close to one end allowing the plates to lean over.",

                "reviewText": "The photograph makes the drying rack look larger than it actually is. In photo, the plates are like 6\" and 4\" plates, the glasses are like juice glasses. and the utensils are like appetizer utensils. The written description is accurate, it is certainly \"SPACE SAVING!\". Works OK for two people, so I kept it. It also works well if you don't like clutter on you kitchen counters tops. Fits well in the sink and fits well for storage under the sink.. It would work well for a small kitchen so I gave \"size\" 5 stars as the drying rack meets the written description. I'll reuse my large old one when I have big jobs like cooking a dinner recipe from scratch or having company for dinner. The size would certainly be a problem for a family.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a bit old school when it comes to dish washing, despite having invested quite a bit of money in a dishwasher that's a work horse and does cool stuff, lol.In 39 years of marriage, I have always - ALWAYS - had a dish drainer on my counter, next to my sink. I grew up with the same thing, lol.And, let me tell ya, I can stack a LOT of dishes into a dish drainer. It's a bit of a super power.But, recently, I have developed a need to declutter my home and my spaces. Not a week goes by that I am not pulling up to the donation center with an entire SUV cargo area stuff to capacity with donations.The kitchen has been my challenge (well, that and the mud room but don't get me started y'all). I have no issue paring down my items, but it still looked cluttered.Then I realized: the dish drainer is really cluttering up my counter.But, the problem is that I am of the \"clean up while you cook\" school of thought, and I tend to wash dishes as I cook dinner. As I start dinner, I fill the sink with hot soapy water and then get to work. As I dirty up a dish, I put it into the soapy water and let it sit. Once the dinner is cooking/baking, then I pop over to the sink and wash up the small bit of dishes I dirtied while cooking.I need a dish drainer for that.Well, this in-sink dish drainer got my attention because it can be used in-sink but also has a tray for use on the counter. The tray is cool because it has a drain hold and channel for water to be diverted to the sink.I have used it in the sink for two days now.I love it.I can still put quite a few bit items in it. I can't really use the glass holders on the outside of it, but I don't really dirty up glasses doing meal prep, so it's fine.I feel like I am saving water because now I only fill the sink half-way with hot soapy water. I wash and put the soapy cleaned dishes into the drainer, over the sink, and then use my hose sprayer to rinse them all off - right in the drainer.So far, it works pretty good.The material of the drainer is pretty thick. It's not a flimsy metal that bends. It can hold quite a bit of weight (two cast iron skillets and two enamelware over cast pot).The ends pull out to expand the handles, but not the drainer itself. That's the same size, no matter what.But the handles do extend out and rest nicely on your sink edges.I'm pretty happy with it and have already come to enjoy coming into the kitchen and not seeing the big old dish drainer on the side of the sink.",
