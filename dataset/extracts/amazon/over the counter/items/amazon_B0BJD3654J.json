I've grown to love this rack, I've been surprised by how much weight it holds, and it's not cumbersome to have on the counter. We've since removed the dish strainer / drying rack and put new crap in its place. We couldn't have put more crap on the counter without this rack. Thanks so much (sarcasm.) Really, I do like this product.",

                "reviewText": "This is a game changer. I am so happy with this purchase. The product is awesome. I use counter space now that I did not have before because of the old dish drain. My husband told me to get this, and I hesitated, but now I am so happy I have this. I wash dishes more because it is so easy to stack in front of me. If you need additional space in your small kitchen, because I definitely have a small kitchen, then this is the perfect dish drain solution for you. Just get one, you will not be disappointed. It's study too. I got the extendable because I have odd sizes in my kitchen. Because this is extendable, it fits perfectly in my kitchen. Get the two tier or the three tier, depending on how much height you have to work with. It is amazing and my kitchen looks awesome. Measure your area before you buy. I love my dish drain. Thank you for this innovative gadget for my kitchen!!!!!",

Other than that it fits perfectly and it does what its supposed to and easy assembly. Leans a bit when it\u2019s unbalanced but that\u2019s probably common sense",
