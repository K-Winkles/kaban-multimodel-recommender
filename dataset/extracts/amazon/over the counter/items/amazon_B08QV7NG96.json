                "reviewText": "Used these to replace old fluorescent fixtures that were beginning to fail. They are small and unobtrusive, very bright, the right color (I chose warm white), easy to install, and very satisfactory. As they make the remaining old fixtures seem dark, I intend to replace all of them with the Yescom. If they last, I will be a very satisfied customer.",
