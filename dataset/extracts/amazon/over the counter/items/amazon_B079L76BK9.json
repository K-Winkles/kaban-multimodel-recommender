There are 30 pills in this pack, which means you will finish this in 5 days so it is something to keep in mind. It's not meant to cure any UTI's, but I used it long enough to relieve myself of it so it does work well. You just need to remember to take it often.It also stained my pee a bright color and I found some stains in my underwear so be wary if you wear a lot of white underwear.",
