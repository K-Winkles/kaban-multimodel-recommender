                "reviewText": "I already had an old wooden over-the-sink shelf rack. I bought one of these and I attached it on top of my old wooden one. I realized it didn't interfere with my view. Then I got the Idea of getting another one just like this expandable self and attached it to the 2nd wire self. Now when I don't have things stacked or hanging on them I can still easily see out my kitchen sink window.Then I soon realized that they make a WONDERFUL DISH STRAINER and I no longer need to use my elec big Dish Washer anymore. Now as I wash dishes by hand and rinse them I just drain the dishes on these over-the-sink shelf racks that I have stacked and secured over my sink in front of my kitchen window. I live in AZ and my dishes dry quickly. It is easier to unload my dishes off these over-the-sink shelf racks then loading and unloading my dishwasher.I just thought I would share how I have stacked and use these over-the-sink shelf racks as a dish drainer drying rack. If anyone does decide to do the same, besides securing them together (I used black ties) I also had to secure the bottom wooden over-the-sink shelf rack on the bottom with black duck gorilla tape to keep it from falling over because one time I accidentally dumped the whole rack over and a few dishes got broke. Now that things are secure these attached over-the-sink shelf racks are beautiful to look it whether they have dishes on them or not and I can still see out my window with or without dishes drying on them. They are practical and very useful as a dish rack dryer drainer.",
