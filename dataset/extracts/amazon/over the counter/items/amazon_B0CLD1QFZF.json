                "reviewText": "These lights emit a soft, white light that's not too harsh, making them good for various applications. What's great is their versatility \u2013 they come with two hooks that can be easily installed under cabinets, and the lights attach magnetically to these hooks. Personally, I got creative and placed one light on my hallway wall close to a bathroom entrance. Thanks to their motion sensor activation, they automatically light up as I approach at night, eliminating the need to fumble for a light switch in the dark.The other light is installed in a stairway, and it provides decent illumination in the dark, as you walk by. However, in well-lit areas, they might not seem as bright. The recharging feature is a plus, and the fact that they're rechargeable is convenient. They offer three modes: on, off, and auto. I primarily use the auto mode to enable motion detection, which works like a charm.",

Problems for this one include: - Light beam is soft and definitely not BRIGHT. - GESTURE switch, tho a nice idea, just doesn't seem to work, very well, unless you're RIGHT ATOP the light - MAGNETS are a bit weak for the weight of this light (and there are only two of them, so if you happen to be slightly off center from them, the light could FALL)All in all, I can't rate this higher than about 3.5, which rounds up to 4 of 5 stars...",
