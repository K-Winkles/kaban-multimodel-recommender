                "reviewText": "The Over the Sink Dry Rack has proven to be a true lifesaver in my tiny kitchen, where counter space is virtually non-existent. With a dual sink setup and no dishwasher, this foldable and stainless steel dry rack has become an indispensable addition for efficient dish drying without the need for counter space.The standout feature of this dry rack is its ingenious design. Able to fold into thirds, it maximizes space when needed and neatly tucks away when not in use. This flexibility is a game-changer for tiny kitchens, providing a practical solution for drying dishes over the sink, utilizing space that would otherwise go unused.Crafted from stainless steel, the dry rack strikes a balance between being lightweight and sturdy. It can effortlessly hold all my dishes without the worry of breakage. The durability of the materials ensures that the rack withstands regular use and stands the test of time, making it a reliable companion in my kitchen.The convenience of having a dedicated space for dish drying directly over the sink cannot be overstated. It eliminates the need for a separate drying mat or counter space, streamlining the dishwashing and drying process. The over-the-sink placement also allows excess water to drain directly into the sink, keeping the kitchen tidy.In conclusion, if you find yourself with minimal counter space and no dishwasher, the Over the Sink Dry Rack is a practical and space-saving solution. Its foldable design, stainless steel construction, and lightweight yet sturdy build make it an ideal choice for efficient dish drying in tiny kitchens. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to optimize space and streamline their kitchen routines.",

It folds into thirds, and is on the thinner side without sacrificing any strength in the stainless steel, making it great to store when not using. You can use on your counter or over your sink-- it fits on both sides of my sink (I have one square sink, one long rectangle shaped one). It saves a lot of counter space using over your sink, which I love. It has silicon sides, which make it easy to fold and also won't scratch your surfaces, as well as hold the rack in place. My husband normally does the dishes, and was really intrigued and excited about using this drying rack. This is a great rack and I recommend getting one if you're in the market for a sleek looking, easily stored drying rack!",

                "reviewText": "The bars are a little longer for our sink but they can be easily cut since the rubber parts can be removed and reattached.This will not only be great for dishes too big for the dish washer and the regular drying rack but also for veggies and other items that need to be set out for a little.It looks easy to clean and might even go in the dishwasher (I will have to test). My hope is the rubber part doesn\u2019t stretch easy or dirties irrepairily over time.",

                "reviewText": "My kitchen is very small, and I have almost no counter space. I do have a double sink with no dishwasher. I placed the rollup metallic drying rack on top of the second sink. This allowed me to get rid of my old drying rack that took up the small counter top. Any water left on the dishes after washing them drain inside the sink. I doubled my counter space by using the drying rack as a place my for my cutting board. I cut vegetables, fruit, bread and cheese. Easy to clean.",
