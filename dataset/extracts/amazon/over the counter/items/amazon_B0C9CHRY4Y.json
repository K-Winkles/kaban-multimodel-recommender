All replacements work now (with a couple of magnet issues), but the battery lasts only a couple of weeks (after about 20 minutes of total lighting). These are used in Bedroom clothes closets so it\u2019s nota lot of use. Has high hopes but look elsewhere if you want something to work properly.",

                "reviewText": "They don\u2019t really brighten up our large area but for small closets medium size closets it\u2019s sufficient. If you have them in the closet for a time and don\u2019t open the closet door much, it will last for quite a while without having a charge. Of course if you are in an area like I have mine in the kitchen underneath their cabinets and they go on and off at night when I\u2019m walking around. You will have to charge them a little more often maybe every four days five days. Easy to install great sticking material 3M. They have two settings stay on and where you can have a motion detection. I am now finished, and I will say it was well worth it, and I would buy them again when I did actually.",

But the battery life is very very short. I bought these because our kitchen it fairly dark so they are used often. I have to plug them in once a day to recharge. The one, I just keep plugged in all the time for convenience and reliability. Which makes the light noticeable with a cord hanging down. Look for something with a longer battery life. You\u2019ll be happier.",
