Don't know about longevity yet.These seem like they're designed to bring a small diameter wire in from your home wiring, as there isn't room for the wire nuts and heavy wire inside the light housing. I was lucky enough to have room to push the wire nuts and house wiring inside the wall and bring a small diameter wire out to the unit. I also had a phillips driver that fit in the holes to install the mounting screws, so mounting to the cabinets was easy.Overall happy with purchase.",

Full disclosure, I don't even begin to consider myself a handyman, rather just a husband with a to do list. These lights weren't difficult at all!We love the 3 color options: 3000, 4000 and 5000. We ended up choosing the 4000 kelvin natural light option, but that is sheer preference.We also like and appreciate the swivel design. We have one under-cabinet area in the corner much deeper than the rest. The swivel allows us to evenly light it up, without it looking dark.And lastly, we so appreciate all of the installation options. You can plug it right into a wall outlet, or you can use and adjust your current wiring to make it all work right. All in all, we are very pleased with these lights, and we would buy them again if needed.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I got these lights to put in while we were remodeling our kitchen. We wanted the lights to be hardwired in. Installing the lights was somewhat straightforward but the included screws to mount them up underneath the cabinets were too long so we had to find shorter screws so that they would not puncture through the bottom of our cabinets.Also there is not much room to work with when your hard-wiring the wires. You cannot have much wire left or it will not fit in the Box even having the minimum amount of wire is hard to get into the box.The lights are all interconnected with the included jumper cables. We got two 8-in lights and 6 12-in lights. When using the cables in between the lights we had to connect two together when we were doing the inner corner cabinet, so keep that in mind. One cable was not long enough to reach diagonally for the light that we put underneath the inner corner cabinet.I also have noticed flickering of the lights since we installed them a couple months ago. The flickering actually started soon after they were installed, if we have the brightness turned all the way up with the dimmer switch (not included). They do still occasionally flicker even when we have them on other settings but more so if they're turned all the way up. I don't know if this is a dimmer switch issue or the lights themselves.The light modes/color (warm/cool) work well and the brightness is good. The make working at the counter much nicer with the light. I also like to leave the lights on the lowest brightness in the evening so that there's a little bit of light in the kitchen when I go in; instead of, it being completely dark.",
