You can press the aid button 5 times in order to adjust the volume that you need. it comes with several assessories, hearing aids case that recharges itself. Has extra Cerumen caps, ear domes. usb cable and a easy manual to read. They fix perfect in my ear. Now when I'm out at Restaurants I can adjust my hearing by tapping my aid. These are hearing aids works better than amplifiers. I highly recommend them. The price is great!!",
