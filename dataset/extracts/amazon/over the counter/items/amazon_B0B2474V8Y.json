The touch lid is a very nice added feature. It is easy to use and closes securely. It is very sturdy. Not flimsy which I thought it might be since it was so cheap! It come with an added ring in the inside of the can to hold the bag in place. It allows you to fold the top of the bag back down into the can so it does not have to hang over the edges. It makes for a cleaner look which I have not seen in other cans. It is very lightweight and come with a cutout that can be used as a handleFor easy carrying. This is the only thing that needs improving. You cannot fit your fingers inside to grasp the can so this feature does not really work that well. The van is so lightweight that you really don\u2019t need to use this feature anyway but it was a good idea. The price for these are so cheap. You get two larger cans and one smaller size. I also wish that they would recommend what size trash can liners to purchase for these. I hope I\u2019m the future that they will come in multiple colors. I would definitely love to see this style in different colors and more sizes. Thanks!",

Plastic shopping bags would be perfect but I live in a state where supermarkets only use paper bags. I love the way it opens from the front or the back. It is extremely sturdy and easy to clean.
