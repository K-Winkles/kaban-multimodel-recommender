                "reviewText": "I really like my stools. They are exactly as described, a smooth tin metal with a wooden seat. The stools took some minor assembly and included screws and key of which were simple to put together.I like the fact that you can leave the back off of the stools if you wish and they will still look great.The wood seat is a little rough however and I could see how a snag on clothing would be a concern however at the price, I am sure you could pick a sealer of some sort up at a hobby store and fix that issue.Stools are sturdy and look appropriate to the picture. I chose the copper color and am very pleased with it. I was having a hard time deciding between that and the bronze and I am definitely glad I got the copper. At a glance it looks almost black but still maintains an aged look that is more of a dark brown and definitely NOT BLACK so if you are looking for black, the this color isn't for you. Again, at the price and the material the stools are made of, you could probably paint them whatever color you wanted and it still look wonderful.Fast shipping as promised and delivered right to my door via UPS. I ordered the 2 stool set and they came in one box. I definitely am happy with them.",

                "reviewText": "Most of all, perfectly convenient! Just over 5\u2019 and I can\u2019t reach my top cupboards. Ugh. Hated going to the garage for a step ladder when I just need something quick from high up! This is so handy to have right in the kitchen. Middle aged and I feel perfectly comfortable climbing up on this. The back is higher than most step ladders of this size and I appreciate that to use to hold onto.As another has mentioned, it\u2019s a narrow step up. Most times I do not care and this does the job. But do be careful, I scraped my ankle once being in a rush.My least favorite thing and this is just decor preference: The frame of it as a whole is petite. It looks kind of funny next to my other basic counter height wood chairs when I use it as a seat at the table. Not a problem when it\u2019s set on it own away from those chairs.The wood seat ain\u2019t comfortable and anyone who thought it would be has to rethink that complaint. My only opinion to share on the seat, is that it startles the crap out of you when it slams down unexpected. Not complaining, it\u2019s a solid wood seat.Overall, I LOVE THIS STEP LADDER CHAIR and would buy again.",

I assembled the backs on two of them and left them off of the other two. The seat part is kind of small compared to most barstools at restaurants. The back part may not be comfortable for larger guests, but these work for me and my house. Leaving the back part off gives me options for different types of seating while also matching. My bar is super high at 42 inches or so and these are the perfect height (30 inches from seat to floor). I recommend these!",

However, I have a bar style kitchen counter and needed something to put there.On the upside these chairs look really nice and fit perfectly at just the right height. The legs have a decent quality rubber on them that is easy to drag across the wood floor and doesn't make any annoying noises.On the downside the seat is so small! I knew it was on the small side but in person it is just tiny. 12\" by 12\" is very small for an adult to sit on. It's possible but only for a short period. No adult sized person is going to get comfortable on these. If you have larger sized people visiting they will NOT be able to sit on these which could cause an awkward conversation.However, for the price they're a decent temporary option if you need to make a bar style kitchen look \"right\". If you expect most of your guests are going to be on the thinner side it will be fine.",
