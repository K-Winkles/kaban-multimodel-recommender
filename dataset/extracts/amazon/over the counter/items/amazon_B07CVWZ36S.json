I received them on 8/2023, effectively giving my batch 9 months before \"expiring.\" While that is a very short expiration span, I am not worried about them 'expiring.' Based on my long experiences in first aid training, reading research papers on the expiration date dilemma on drugs, and working in the pharmaceutical sector in my younger years, these Advil packets that are sealed tightly in foil packets will last for a few years.This product is good for 'multi symptoms,' which is why I selected these for my first-aid kits. They key is the ingredients. Heck, the formula is the exact same for some Advil products under different naming schemes. Another reviewer said they received some 40 packets. Out of curiosity, I counted mine. All advertised 50 packets were included.",
