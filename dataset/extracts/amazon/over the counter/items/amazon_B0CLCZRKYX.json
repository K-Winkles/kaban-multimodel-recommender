The adjustable design is dope \u2013 fits my sink perfectly, and the stainless steel is legit sturdy. No more rust worries! Plus, since it's over-the-sink, it keeps water from messing up my counter and makes it easy to dry without needing a tray to divert water to the sink. Easy to put together, easy to clean \u2013 just what I needed. With all the extra holders and hooks, it's basically the kitchen MVP, saving me space and keeping everything in check. Highly recommend it to anyone tired of kitchen chaos!",

This is my favorite part.-it's pretty sturdy I think.-hangs over your sink and you save more counter space.-the price seems somewhat reasonable.-worth it. Just buy it.Also the only con I have: there's a few black plastic pieces that the instructions aren't very clear on where they go. But other than that. Super easy and straight forward.

                "reviewText": "Hate countertop dish racks so had an in-sink rack. Not ideal, as I lost half my sink. Decided to try this, thinking it\u2019d be too bulky.I love it. It\u2019s sturdy, holds a lot, looks nice (though I expected it to be stainless in color, it\u2019s actually matte gray, which I prefer). Mine came with a knife rack that\u2019s a little dented / wonky on top, but it doesn\u2019t affect functionality so I don\u2019t mind. It also dries my dishes faster than the in-sink rack because it\u2019s gets more air flow.I\u2019m grateful!",
