It's the perfect size for the items and even has a tray that fits underneath to catch excess water that's easy to slide out to clean. It's big enough to hold all the items in the description picture but small enough not to be too bulky. Happy with this purchase.",

There\u2019s a plastic piece underneath that collects water. It\u2019s a little inconvenient that it doesn\u2019t have a drain spout, but not a deal breaker. There\u2019s also four black rubber pieces on the bottom so the caddy doesn\u2019t slide around easily. 9/10 recommend.",
