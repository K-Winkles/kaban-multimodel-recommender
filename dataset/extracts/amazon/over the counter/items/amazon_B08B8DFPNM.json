One is used straight against a wall, the other 90\u00b0 in a corner. They both provide a lot of storage and still leave room under. Sturdy, not wobbly and pretty. Surface wiped clean from a butter smear and a honey leak. Pictures are not staged but how we actually use them.",

I\u2019ve included a picture, but disregard the white jewelry displays because they don\u2019t match. I was just using it for the photo.This was extremely easy to put together in just minutes. I usually have a hard time with small screws, but this was very simple. I like the look, the color was rich, and the unit was very sturdy before and after I put my jewelry displays on them. The hooks were missing in the box but I called Amazon and they are replacing that.I really recommend this for its intended purpose in the kitchen or bathroom but also for display at craft shows and my retail space and a local boutique ,etc. I would definitely buy more.",

The directions were super clear - no need to turn them upside down to figure them out. And wow, done!Only thing - make sure to measure that you have enough space where you want to put.

Chipped corners, rusty fixings. It looks cheap and nasty, something I was hoping to avoid seeing as this costs nearly \u00a340!!!! I was, stupidly, expecting a decent quality product. I would have been better off going to my local b&m and seeing if they had a similar item. It would have cost a fraction of the price.I put it together hoping it would at least be strong and sturdy as advertised, but the legs are wobbly, two of them are different lengths so that end is unstable.Honestly, save your money, please do not buy this item. Frankly, I'm ashamed of myself for thinking it was going to be anything less than rubbish and I can't believe I paid 40 quid for it. Shocking.",
