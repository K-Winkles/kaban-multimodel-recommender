Affordable price, its super sturdy and easy to put together (My husband usually does the handy dandy put together stuff).

Only bad thing is that I didn\u2019t have it sooner\ud83d\ude1c. I have a VERY small kitchen. With the 2 little sinks. So I was worried on finding one that would fit. Bc I also have 2 cabinets above each side of the sink. But it fits just fine. I love how u can expand it or make is smaller for the perfect fit. The water doesn\u2019t drain down all on my counter either. I was worried it would drip behind the it or something. It doesn\u2019t. It frees up so much counter space. I also have a very nosy kitty, who loves to get on my dishes. This helped that as well. I really do recommend this dish drainer! It seems sturdy and perfect for my small family. I\u2019m a single momma with 2 sons and it\u2019s plenty big for us. If u have a large family I\u2019d get one with 3 levels instead of 2. For me, this size is perfect and I couldn\u2019t be happier! Was worth every dollar!",

                "reviewText": "So unfortunately, I bought this without actually measuring my sink and I was just like whatever the hell with it. By the way, bad idea. Nonetheless, I still made it work, what I did was added some castor wheels that I got from Walmart. My daughter and I also added an old top to a storage bin to catch the water. So now, when I wash dishes, I can just roll it over to me. The top to the plastic bin makes it easy to wipe it off, no spill no mess. I will say the only thing that irritated me besides me not actually measuring before I bought, was the bottom bar. If you look closely you can see it\u2019s kind of bent, but again that might actually be my fault for tightening it too tight. Everything else fit in place but that bottom bar. One last thing the stars that they have me grading it on says suction power. No clue what that is for so I\u2019m a put it at a one star. Not trying to bring it down. I guess the grade of it is very good,I just don\u2019t know what is considered suction power if that makes sense.",

I love it in the space and think it adds character.Other reviews mention the knife holder\u2026that piece is completely useless. Horrible design and not functional at all. I have yet to find a use for it. I just put my knives in the utensils holder and that seems to work fine for me. I also forgot to put the hooks on as they need to be done during putting it together and I didn\u2019t realize that. And it wasn\u2019t important enough for me to take it apart to put them on.

                "reviewText": "If you follow the directions as exactly shown on the picture, everything should fit properly together and no swaying whatsoever. I thought the sponge holder I got must have a design flaw because it doesn't stay upright; it turns out I needed to place it on either side of the rack, so it'll sit on top of the bottom, adjacent, horizontal rod of the legs. The first big mistake which caused many of the bad reviews/videos about the shelves not fitting also happened to me until I figured out that the Flat horizontal railing (A1) for the left and right frame should be on the Inside and Not on the Outside, also the same reason for the Swaying. Once this is corrected, everything fits together perfectly and steady. Two things I missed but easily corrected was forgetting to put in the hooks and the rubber cushions for the bottom rod (maybe someone can explain to me why only the bottom rod needs the cushions, but not the other ones?) Yes, the height between the bottom and top shelf is too low for dinner plates, so I just moved that shelf to the top instead. I'm getting non-slip dish drying mat to place under the shelf to catch water that doesn't fall in the sink and to better hold it in place since it's so close to the edges. The utensil holder is just way too small, but my plastic utensil holder from my countertop dish rack fits on it perfectly, so problem solved. Update: My dish washer is on the fritz, so there are a lot more dishes than usual, but makes for a good picture. Again, the utensil holder is too small, so I squeezed the cup size utensil holder into the bottom ring instead of the top ring (slight bending of the top ring is needed to get it to fit between the rings), this made it perfect for holding long handle spatulas and ladles. Instead of having all the hooks on the bottom level, I put 4 of the hooks on the top level; this way they would all be on one side and out of the way of the faucet and washing. The dish drying mat does catch some of the water and also helps to keep the rack from being accidently push out of place, but still have problem with too much water collecting near the back splash. I would move the rack closer forward toward the sink, but the bottom horizontal rod behind the faucet (where the soap dish is hanging) is just a tad too low and would get in the way of the faucet handle. I'm tempted to make my own holes and move that annoying horizontal rod higher up and hang the soap dish on the rod just below the black utensil holder...Overall, it's a very decent over the sink rack for the price. It's my first and definitely helps in giving me more counter space for my very small kitchen.",

I gained so much space, everything sits nicely and drains into the sink. I use the books for my dish cloth and dish gloves and when they're dry, you can slide the hooks over to the side. This rack makes me happy to clean and organize! And the plant on top makes it look nice (I was worried it would obscure my window and look junky). 100% recommend. The only thing I can't comment on yet is the cleaning when water buildup starts. I am hoping this will be a breeze, but that remains to be seen.
