                "reviewText": "This nifty organizer for the bathroom counter is a game-changer. No more morning chaos \u2013 everything's neatly in place. The design is genius; it fits snugly in the corner, saving precious counter space. Plus, the tiers make it easy to categorize my stuff \u2013 toothpaste, brushes, skincare \u2013 all have their little homes. It's like my own little clutter-free zone.Assembly was a breeze \u2013 no engineering degree needed. Sturdy too; it's taken a couple of accidental bumps like a champ. The clear acrylic gives it a sleek look, blending seamlessly with the bathroom decor. What I love most is the stress it saves me in the AM rush. No more searching for that elusive lip balm or dealing with a toppled toothpaste tube. It's a small investment that pays off big in terms of sanity. If you're on the fence about decluttering your bathroom space, this organizer is a solid win.",

They work great on one side, but the other side is slightly off because one end is designed to be fatter than the other and it doesn\u2019t quite clear the edge of my sink. I think it would be awesome if the seller offered a \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d version. You can kind of see this in the photo. Only real qualm is that the color is not as pictured. I still like the color enough, but it\u2019s darker and not as vibrant as the jewel-tone green that\u2019s pictured.",

                "reviewText": "The shelves arrived with no scratches. The polls and handles came carefully, wrapped to help protect the shells from being cracked during delivery. This was very easy to assemble without directions. The product is acrylic not glass or crystal. It\u2019s lightweight so it may not be as sturdy as glass but I would rather it be lightweight and portable. As you can see, I have three shelves and I have room for even more product on the shelves. There was plenty of storage space. If you are concerned about storage space get the three shelves. The size is advertised as 10 x 6 in the illustration. But as a smart consumer, I read the reviews before I ordered and saw that it was 10 x 10 by reading the comments and looking at their pictures. I am pleased with the size even though it does come close to my outlet but I have an outlet on the floor that I can also use. So that is not a problem for me. Give the price point of this product. I think that it was a good deal. It also arrived within two days with no shipping cost. So yes I would recommend this product. I am considering getting one for my daughter.",
