                "reviewText": "I was SO excited to get this dish drain. While it\u2019s not meant for draining large amounts of dishes, it is perfect for a few and takes up so much less counter space. The color is beautiful and true to the image in the listing. However, the chrome bolts are low quality and the top of one popped off while tightening. The directions are a little wonky, but I managed. Unfortunately, the accessories only hook on loosely and first thing I bumped in to one of them and it fell off and onto the floor. The corner shattered into a million tiny little pieces so I couldn\u2019t even glue it back together. I had to put that basket on the other side out of view, and it\u2019s not very functional for me there because I wash my beechwood handle utensils by hand and put them there to drain and the basket it hard t reach.Looks pretty, but disappointed in the quality.",

I'm a total clutz and it took me five minutes to assemble it! And it's beautiful in my blue/checkerboard retro kitchen. Very sturdy. After reading some negative reviews, I had somewhat low expectations as I thought it would seem 'cheap'. Not at all. I had realistic expectations -- as it is plastic after all plastic-- but it superceded the expectations I had. If you want something beautiful in your kicthen, do not hesitate to purchase this eye-appealing, practical, kitchen-enhancing item.",
