But they do make me feel better and pretty quickly too. The only thing I will say is that, although the flavor isn't a bad one, it's not great when I'm feeling nauseated. The sweet lemon is kind of sickening. I haven't looked to see if they have other flavors yet but I would love maybe a mint one instead!",
