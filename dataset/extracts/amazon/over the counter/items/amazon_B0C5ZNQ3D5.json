                "reviewText": "I got the LED light over my sink from a big box store. It was nice and bright but it also hit me right in the eyes no matter where I placed it. I got this as a replacement to address that problem.My light is hardwired and this light also allows for that. It can also be part of a string of undercounter lights (cord included) or plugged into an outlet (also cord included). It was easy to wire. My only problem arose with the front of the light not hanging flush. No matter how I adjusted the mounting screws, I couldn't find the sweet spot because they are located toward the back of the light and usually, they are centered to avoid this. No worries. I had a piece of heavy duty double sided tape that was extra from when I installed my dashcam. Now it hangs perfectly.I like that you have a choice between color temperatures. I wish it were a bit brighter but that's because I'm old. Nonetheless, this gets five stars.",

                "reviewText": "Pros-1. Bright diffuse lighting covering pleasant amber to near daylight coloring.2. Very easy installation.3. All the cords necessary to setup.4. Screws included.Cons-1. Wall cord might be too short for certain applications.2. Two screws may not be enough.3. Only one small light switch on one end.Summary - The lighting is bright enough for installing over my kitchen sink and countertop but unfortunately the provided cord was a bit short to do proper cable management to my outlet. I'll have to either get a short extension cord or use this somewhere else like my workbench. It's touted diffusion pattern is supposed to be the main selling point but most lighting of this type that mimics fluorescent tubes are already diffused enough so you may not tell the difference. The included wood screws is a plus but I feel like the light might need about 4 screws to properly distribute the weight. The whole light isn't heavy though. Perhaps 2 screws is all that is needed but my kitchen cabinets are press board and I know overtime press board is not that strong for load bearing stuff. If my cabinets were true wooden ones, I'd have much more confident in having just two screws. There are additional knockout holes if you want more mounting options. To mount the light you have to temporarily remove the long panel to reveal the screw holes for mounting. You can also do some daisy chaining the same type of light, a linking power cable is provided. The CRI rating of 90, I'll have to take the manufacturer's word for it. Who knows maybe I can use it for product photography lighting.",

Initially I had replaced the old time model with puck lights that didn\u2019t provide enough light and ran through batteries quickly. This new fixture gives the brightest and most consistent light on the sink and countertops.. I got the plug in model and liked it so much that I bought a second to go under the cabinets over the countertops to the left of the sink. I like that you can choose from 3 levels of light on each fixture by sliding a button.",

                "reviewText": "I used to have a 24 inch flourescent light under this cabinet you see in the photos. It was fine, but I really wanted to try an LED since they require so much less energy to use, and I've read they are brighter.This light is easy to install. There is instructions included that are actually usable. You can either hard wire it or use the included 4 foot cord (this is the method I used, since my last light was installed this way by the previous owner.)This light is very low profile, and wow is it bright. Not so bright that it is offensive, but it really lights up a workspace. The switch is fairly easy to locate (it's that small white toggle on the same surface as the light, you can barey see it in my first photo at the far end.)Room for improvement: I wish the cord was a little longer, but where does that end; 6 feet would be nice. Also, the switch could be a little larger. Otherwise, this is a great light.Thanks AKIHE!",
