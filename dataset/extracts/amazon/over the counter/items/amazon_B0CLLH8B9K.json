Not too big, not too small \u2013 just perfect for my daily fruit slicing adventures. I'm the unofficial fruit salad master in my family, so this board has become my trusty sidekick. When it arrived, both sides were covered with a protective film, which I thought was a thoughtful touch. It keeps the surface pristine and scratch-free. The thickness is just right too \u2013 it feels durable without being bulky. It's like the Goldilocks of cutting boards, not too thick, not too thin.",

                "reviewText": "The acrylic cutting board is a versatile kitchen tool that suits various purposes. One of its notable features is its substantial thickness, making it an excellent choice as a temporary cutting surface for fruits and vegetables. Its thickness adds durability and stability, enhancing its usability in the kitchen. The ease of cleaning is another advantage, offering a hassle-free solution for maintaining a hygienic kitchen environment. The black color, which I opted for, not only imparts a sophisticated and high-end appearance but also exhibits resistance to stains, making it a practical choice for daily use. Furthermore, the anti-slip design is a thoughtful addition, ensuring that the cutting board stays securely in place on the kitchen countertop during food preparation. This feature adds an extra layer of safety and convenience, preventing any unwanted movement while chopping or slicing. In conclusion, this acrylic cutting board stands out for its thickness, easy cleaning, sophisticated black color, and anti-slip design. It proves to be a valuable addition to the kitchen, providing a reliable and aesthetically pleasing surface for various culinary tasks. Whether you're chopping, slicing, or dicing, this cutting board offers a practical and stylish solution.",

                "reviewText": "This cutting board really solves a small problem for us - our other cutting boards are not always big enough, and none of them look good left on the counter. This is both attractive and large enough for almost every use and can be left out. The non-slip \"bumpers\" that come with it work like a charm, and seem impervious to being cleaned.As expected, and ass you can see in the photo, the board scratches with ease. Just setting expectations.",

                "reviewText": "This acrylic cutting board is a great choice for anyone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen. The 17x13-inch size provides plenty of room for all my chopping needs, from vegetables to meat, making meal prep a breeze. But what really sets this board apart is the counter lip, which hugs my kitchen counter and ensures the board stays in place no matter how hard I chop. Acrylic materials are not only beautiful; It provides a clean, hygienic surface, is easy to maintain, and doesn't dull my knives.",

My husband likes to use the cutting board to prep his meats and vegetables before he heads to the grill. This board is a good cutting board. It does a good job protecting our counters. It is also lightweight enough to be easily carried out to the grill fully loaded. The board looks and feels like it is solidly constructed and should last a long time. A great option for a cutting board that does a good job protecting our counter surface.",
