This design is modern and has a variety of colors if you want to change it up. The material is flexible, but sturdy! And is very easy to clean either by hand or dish washer! My dish drying rack fits perfectly, and it catches any water that drips down. I would love to get a few more colors of this product to change up the look of my kitchen soon! Amazing!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really like this mat. It\u2019s flexible which makes it easy to clean between the raised parts, and it\u2019s elevated just enough so that it can hold quite a lot of water while letting your cups and glasses and even dishes drain properly. Since it\u2019s silicone, which I\u2019m a big fan of, you can also use it to place hot items on it That came off the stove or oven. But I use it predominantly as a low profile cup and dish rack when I\u2019m doing a quick wash for a handful of glasses. Really well-made and I expected to last for a really long time.",

The material is great and I love the design.Con: I shake off dishes, etc. that I wash and rinse and then put onto the mat. The little bit of water that collects in the grooves doesn't dry up. I can leave a few dishes in it for two days and that little bit of water will still be there. So it holds the water rather than a cloth dish mat that would absorb the water.",
