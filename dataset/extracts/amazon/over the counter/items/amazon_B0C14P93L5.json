The fit is okay, just a pinch shy of the end of stove width, more like stops right when the burners stopped, (no overhang) but that might make it more steady this way. The demension is probably an a half inch off, measurement is at the middle of board which is longer than the ends. It does not reach to the back of the stove. Think of it as a burner cover. I like how there is no grooves but has a nice smooth top so no crumbs or anything can hide in. I have a smaller cutting board that matches this and it holds up great. All in all it does the trick and covers the whole gas stove top. My fault about the color.",

                "reviewText": "This came on time and exceeds my expectations. It\u2019s super smooth and elegant looking, as well as being very useful as a cutting board. I dont really want to use it as a cutting board though, as it\u2019s too pretty to scratch up, lol. It\u2019s very heavy duty too, not cheap or lightweight.",
