                "reviewText": "Few reasons to give this a 5 star.1) I appreciate no batteries needed. It has a cord with USB port for charging2) they are held up with magnet strips w/adhesive back. So you can take the lights off and on and don't have to be too exact when positioning under the cabinets. Made for super easy install - Also makes for easy RE charging. It has a button that is red while charging and turns green when fully charged.3) the motion detector works well. it is a little slower than would like, but overall pretty reactive.4) you have different levels of brightness, which I loved having the control over - under cabinetry was more dim, or closet area where i prefer brighter light, adjusting was easy.",

                "reviewText": "Comes as a pair. Charges quickly. Using one to light a basement stairwell with the other in reserve. It's been going on and off religiously at least 4-5 times a day for 3 weeks and still hasn't required recharging.Has two short charging cords, extra magnetic mounting plates, screws and decent instructions. The light is bright and adjustable. The motion detector is sensitive enough to do the job but not annoying. And the light turns off in 30 seconds or so if unattended. Excellent value!",

                "reviewText": "These were easy to install and work really well. I have it set on auto, so they light up each time I walk by or even when pets walk by. The only downside is that I have to charge just about every day, so the charge does not last that long, and I don't want to keep them plugged into the outlet.",

The dimmer button is an awesome touch!If you\u2019re mounting directly to something magnetic just simply attach. Or if you need light elsewhere, the mounting plates are easy to install.Ordering another set for the toolbox!",

                "reviewText": "I needed lights in my stereo cabinet to illuminate my albums. These were very easy to install, look good and do the job. The \"auto\" mode is excellent -- the motion sensor turns on the light when I open the cabinet door and then turns off in about 15 seconds after it's closed. I liked them so much I bought two more for other cabinets. I was concerned about recharging but that's no problem since they're magnetic. So once you mount the metal plates, the light is easily comes on and off. Tip - - The plates are already installed on the back and it appears they are adhered - they're not - - just pull them off for installation - - they're only magnetically placed there.",

I bought these for under my kitchen wall cabinets and they work well. I can relocate one of them as needed. They are thin so you do not see them tucked up under framed cabinets. The light isn\u2019t super bright but bright enough for reading a cookbook or doing tasks. They charge very quickly and you can either turn them off and on as needed or set the auto feature which works well. I'm very happy with them.",
