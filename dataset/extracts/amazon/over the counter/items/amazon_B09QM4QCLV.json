                "reviewText": "Fits perfectly over our sink. We have a double sink so I was worried it would not fit but it's just long enough. We have been using it for just over a month daily- we do not have a dishwasher atm. It's very sturdy and the dishes dry very fast. There is also a surprising amount of room for drying. With that being said if you have a lot of larger dishes that need to dry, especially pots and pans it does fill up fast. We also have very large dinner plates, they fit but we do have to put them in at an angle.I was also worried that the top rack would get in the way while washing but that is not the case. There are no issues using the sink or our hose attachment which is on the side of the sink. Most of the water from the dishes will drip back into the sink which is great- no more soaking wet dish mats or towels! We do place towel on the edges to catch the drips from the pan holder, silverware and cups but it's minimal.",

All sections (shelves, holders, etc.) are optional to include when building but everything shown comes in this kit.We do not have a dishwasher and also have a very small kitchen so this is a lifesaver. It even has a compartment where we now store all of our knives - further saving counter space. The rack also extends to a wider width. Completely collapsed it fit our sink perfectly (standard small sink). Will fit much larger sinks if needed.",

It holds up when I have 2 stainless steel pots and a large frying pan, and a bunch of dishes on it (although I avoided placing cast iron pots on).The design is what got me to purchase, because having water drips right back into the sink makes sense. Dishes seem to dry quicker than on-the-country racks, perhaps because mine sits right in front of window and gets airflow.If you have cats, this is the best dish rack. Cats won't walk all over it leaving hair on clean dishes, and this dish rack saves counter space for them to walk on, so they love it too!I recommand this product. It is slightly pricey, but the fact that it holds up to weight, saves counter space, and overall has a good design, it's worth the price.",
