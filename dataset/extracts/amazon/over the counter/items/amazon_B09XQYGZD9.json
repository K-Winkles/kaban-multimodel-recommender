                "reviewText": "Easy to install. I ended up hanging them horizontal instead of vertical due to my cabinets have a lip. I couldn't fit a mug on the 4th hook because of it. I ended up using the 3rd one for hanging my mixer attachments!! Since I only had 3 attachments and didn't really need the 4th hook I was able to mount this one vertically. Over all these worked exactly what I needed them for. The hooks are a little close together for my comfort causing mugs to be right against each other so I ended up rotating the ends of the mugs for a better fit.",
