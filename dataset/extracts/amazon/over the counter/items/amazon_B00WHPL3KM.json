Even though I have a dishwasher, I like to wash some things by hand, especially pots and pans that take up too much space in the dishwasher. Also there are a few things that might not do well in the dishwasher. The one that I have had for so many years is a white, vinyl covered drainer. It has recently begun to show a little rust in a few small places....still useable but I wanted to replace it.I looked at all similar drainers that were available and read the reviews on them. This one was less expensive than the others that I was considering. It looked the most like the one that I'm used to and know works the way I like. I measured my sink and ordered the correct size. It fits perfectly, looks nice and I'm confident that it should last for a long time. I like the fact that the parts that aren't covered in the black vinyl (plastic or whatever) are stainless steel and I'm hoping that it doesn't rust. I also chose this one because it doesn't have the adjustable end pieces and feel that it is more sturdy because of this. This little sink dish drainer comes in handy for so many things!",

                "reviewText": "There\u2019s only two of us in our household and not always a reason to run the dishwasher (often weeks go buy without a need). I hate the clutter of a large dish rack draining on the counter. This is the perfect solution. We have a double sink and this only takes up half of one side, leaving plenty of space to still rinse whatever I want or still use the other sink (and disposal) in its entirety. This item is coated so should not rust easily but that said, eventually I would suppose it might possibly in some areas after a few years but for under $20 I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s a huge issue. Be sure to measure your sink as it is not adjustable. It would be even better if it had devoted space for flatware but it\u2019s still a very good little space saver and handy item for any kitchen. I also use it to defrost items from the freezer so the drip directly into the sink rather than leave on the counter. I definitely recommend this item as long as the dimensions fit your sink.",

Because the sink has only one big opening, I would have to put a dish drainer on my kitchen countertop, which I absolutely despise. So in comes this sleek, narrow dish drainer that goes over our sink! It looks amazing, it functions perfectly, and stores more dishes than one would imagine. Best of all, it doesn't take up too much space, so I still have plenty of room to wash my dishes and large pots without bumping into it. I bought an extra one just in case they stop carrying them..the last one lasted us for over 5 years.",

The rubberized bottom and handles are great for preventing it from slipping and scratching against our countertops. We have a dishwasher, so we use this dish rack to dry out hand washed dishes. It\u2019s quite small so I would not recommend this to someone hand washing all of their dishes.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item mainly to hold my sponges and dish rag. I have two sponges, one that I labeled to clean the cat's feeding/water dishes and another one to clean the sink. Also, with this sink, I can't put the dish rag over the center because water tends to drip on it so this is a perfect solution. It keeps everything out of the sink and off of the counters. It fits perfectly and is very sturdy. I don't really use it for dishes. The inside measurement of my sink is 16.25 inches. I also love how it looks in the kitchen. It is very stylish and should last a long time. (I purchased my hand soap and hand lotion dispensers from Amazon as well. They are the Godinger Dublin lotion dispensers.)",

We have a large sink, not a double sink. but this gives room to walk and dry. the annoying but is our plates dont fit in the slats and there is no where to dry the silverware so they just fall through the cracks. i do like the rubber on the drain portion so it will limit rusting. i think if i add a little holder for silverware then its more useful. will keep because its the perfect wee size. its narrow, but unless you just hosted 10 people this drainer does fine for a household of two.",

                "reviewText": "My partner and I bought this as a temporary solution for our very strangely-sized double sink, but I've mentioned to him many times that I'm actually very happy with it. It is very sturdy and is holding up very well. I really like that one side is slotted for plates, and the other is flat for glasses/whatever else. It is a huge difference when it comes to safely stacking clean dishes to dry (we don't have a dishwasher, so that is LOTS of dishes, pots, pans, and cups a day...) My only criticism would be that it doesn't come with a cutlery compartment, but I understand that not everyone wants that. We ended up just getting a plastic container at the dollar store, and we can remove it if we're not washing cutlery and need more space in the actual rack. But otherwise, we're very happy with our purchase! :)",

It'll hold a few things at a time for some quick dishes. Doesn't take up a lot of space. It feels sturdy and clean.Can definitely recommend the product.
