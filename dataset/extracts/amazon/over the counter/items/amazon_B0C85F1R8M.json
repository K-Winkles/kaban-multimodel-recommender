Perfect size from view and bright enough to get job done. The fact that you can simply plug them in with the included usb cord is a bonus! I have shown these to my friends and family and they said they would be buying some in the near future. These are nice little LED lightbars with 3 brightness levels, motion detector, and a sticky strip to attach it with magnectic connector. I love how they automatically come on when I walk by. So far I haven't had to recharge them, so the charge goes a long time!",

I ordered my set as soon as I returned home. These lights are wonderful!!! I used 5 of them under my kitchen cabinets and one is under my hutch. Charging is a breeze with the stand that will charge 3 of the 6 units at the same time. They show red when you put them in the charger and once they are fully charged it changes to blue. Installation was so simple and only took a few minutes. I wish I had found this product sooner. It has changed my kitchen for the better.",

When he played around with them and saw all the light they gave off, he said never mind returning this, I know what to do with them. I took a nap and when I woke, I went looking for hubby and noticed that he had been busy putting lights under the kitchen cabinets, in the bathrooms, and in closets. I love that if I wake up in the middle of the night, I don't have to put the big light on. Instead, as I start walking toward the bathroom the two lights give me the exact light I need without totally waking me up.",

I have gone through a lot of cheap motion sensor lights and they have either broke from falling or have to be charged very frequently that its not worth using them any more. I splurged on these and they haven't let me down. They hold their charge a very long time, I have yet to charge on and it has been over a week. The coolest feature about these lights is that you can set them to turn on only in the daytime, only in the nighttime or any time it senses motion. I set it to only turn on at night so it doesn't waste battery during the day when its light out. Another cool feature is that these lights will turn back on immediately if needed. My other lights just stayed off and I stood there in the dark waving my hands around trying to get it to come back on again. These have quickly become my favorite sensor lights.",
