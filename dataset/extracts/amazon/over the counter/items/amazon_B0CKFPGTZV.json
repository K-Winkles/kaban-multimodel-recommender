It is necessary for calcium and phosphorus absorption to help build and maintain strong bones and teeth, provide immune system support, and for healthy muscle function. Vitamin D3 is synthesized when bare skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) light. However, studies show that most people do not get the recommended amount from sunlight alone. NatureWise Vitamin D3 delivers the same biologically active form of Vitamin D produced in the body as a result of direct sunlight - without the risk of unprotected UVB exposure. Since Vitamin D is fat-soluble, we include certified organic olive oil as a healthy fat source for better absorption. NatureWise supplements are proudly manufactured in USA-based facilities that comply to the strictest cGMP standards and are carefully tested by third party laboratories for purity and potency, as well as physical and chemical contamination, guaranteeing the highest standards of quality and safety.",

The soft gels are easy to swallow, so no hassle there. Plus, they're gentle on the stomach, which is a big win. Since I started taking it, I've felt more energetic and just better overall. It's a lifesaver during those dark, sun-deprived months. And it's not just about feeling good; it helps keep your bones strong and your immune system in top shape too. What's cool is that NatureWise is all about quality, so you know you're getting the good stuff. And the price won't break the bank either.

                "reviewText": "A little over a year ago, I had to quit taking the gel caps due to an esophageal stricture, caused by a sliding hiatal hernia/acid reflux. This was so hard on me. I never found anything that took the place of these excellent vitamin D3 gel caps. I would give some to my husband, then forget. Recently I noticed my husband sneezing a lot (and it's not allergy season). I looked at our bottle of vitamin D3 (I always loved the 5,000 IU amount), and I gasped. They were waaaay outdated. So I ordered a new bottle of these Naturewise D3. Wow! For one thing the bottle is smaller but there are still 90 capsules. When I took one of the gel caps out of the new bottle, I noticed it seemed to be slimmer and I wondered if I could swallow it. Yay! I CAN SWALLOW IT! I put one side by side with one of the older ones. The new one looks more elongated and thinner, but like it has the same amount of content. Because of this thinner design, I am able to easily swallow the new ones. Now I'm going take one *every* day, and give it to my husband too. We are retired and I've noticed we've seemed weaker with less energy. I'm thinking that now, after starting to take this wonderful vitamin D3, once again, we will be faring much better. My husband has gout attacks and most of the things that have vitamin D in it, he can't take. He's also less mobile, so he doesn't get outside as much. So I'm hoping these will give us much of our vitality back and take away our sneezes and runny noses, as well as making my husband less pale. I'll get back, once we've been taking these again for about a month. I would highly recommend this vitamin D3 supplement by this amazing company. And my thanks to the makers for making it easier to swallow!.. Oh and the price of 90 capsules is amazing, for such a high quality supplement! You can't go wrong, here. This from a woman who takes most of her supplements in liquid form. Happy buyer, here:)",
