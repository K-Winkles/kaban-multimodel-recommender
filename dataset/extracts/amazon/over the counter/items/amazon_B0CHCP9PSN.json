I was a little hesitant about the temp. of 800 degrees - and possible smoking, but it was never an issue. The first pizza got a little too done on the top, but this pizza maker comes with individual dials for the top and the bottom. Once I adjusted the top a little lower the following pizzas were PERFECT. The dough recipe in the booklet is easy and delicious as well. The bottom crust was done to perfection. I can't give it enough stars. Well worth the money",

                "reviewText": "Forget making your own dough unless you really know how. My first attempt was horrible. The unit was heating up for the second use and I guess I did not clean the brick enough the smoke and the bursts of fire on the debris left on the brick were very upsetting and scary. It was my error, however. I got a wire brush and used it to get as much of the remains from the last pizza off and it was fine. The brick will stain, no problem it is supposed to, but you have to clean any leftover dough or anything off of it before the next use or the smoke will drive you out of the house. I love the way it cooks the pizza and it tastes delicious, as good as any pizza I have ever had. I got the ready-made raw dough from Trader Joe's and it is delicious and less than a $1.50 for the dough. That is well worth it. The crust was crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. Trying to make a yeast dough myself was too much trouble. Highly recommend and am so glad I did not return it. Also, my neighbor who is a chef told me to use grits or corn meal on the slider. He was right, if you don't flour and grit the wooden slider your dough will stick and that is not fun. You won't be able to get it off the slider and on to the brick. The brick is very hot (800 degrees) and you don't want to be playing around with removing the doughy pizza. Made sure you shake the slider while preparing the pizza and keep the raw dough from sticking. I use a good amount of flour and grits. The grits or the corn meal act like a ball bearing to keep the dough from sticking, use flour too though.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this because the temperature was high, it could be used indoors and the price was reasonable. I've only made a couple pizzas in this so far. The first pizza I made was a flop. It was a far cry from pizzeria pizza. The second one was much much better as I had a better sauce and the dough rested overnight. I could tell I was on my way to making excellent home pizzas. Home pizzas are a bit of a pain to make, though. Unless you use store bought premade dough and sauce it takes a while to prepare everything. Most pizza dough recipes are about the same, though, consisting of flower, olive oil or honey, salt and yeast. Which ever way you make the dough be sure to let it REST IN THE REFIGERATOR OVER NIGHT. That is the difference between a good tasting dough and a blaaaah dough.The Granitstone pizza oven has its quirks. First, if you have the temperature all the way up to 800 degrees after putting the pizza in it the temperature will show a drop to about 500 degrees and stay there. I don't know if the stone is staying hotter or not as the temperature gauge is measuring the air temperature above the pizza. I also found that you may want to turn the upper burner temperature down a little to keep from burning the top. This is because if your pizza is a little thick or the dough rises much, like mine did, you may find the top burning in spots before the crust is done. I wish the upper element was about an inch or so higher so toppings don't touch it resulting in burnt spots. This also mean you can't cook a deep dish (or even a medium thick) pizza in this oven. But this is a good starter oven to see if you really want to get into cooking pizzas at home. I'm thinking they taste so much better made at home than bought from a pizzeria or frozen.",

                "reviewText": "My family loves this gem. Bakes pizza in minutes. The more stained the stone becomes, the better the flavor for the pizza. Just be careful to make things pizza, and poke some holes. The pizza maker is not very tall, so there's not much space for the pizza to grow, and if it does, it will hit the top and burn. Love the window on top and the dual temp dials. Got it at a great price, too!",

                "reviewText": "So after prepping the Piezano (Love this name! If you ever watched The Mario Brothers cartoon you'll know why) like the directions suggested, it is fairly simple to use. The thermometer didn't work and pretty sure it was broken from the start or broke during the first heating. It also did not seem to heat up to 800 degrees. Nothing cooked in 8 minutes time, hence thinking it doesn't heat to the temp it is supposed to. We've tried it four times and our gas oven with a stone works better and is just as easy. They both heat up the space you are using though the piezano is less., is you are thinking it would be better than your oven during hot weather. There is a steep learning curve not getting your dough to stick to the pizza peal so it slides off onto the stone. It is easy to clean. It has a terrible chemically electric burning smell that is eye burning and off putting. It does give you a very crisp bottom crust! If your dough is thin enough it can get cracker like. There is a learning curve to using the top heat element. Too hot and it will burn your toppings because the bottom is cooked, ect. We decided to return it due to it's price point and not being entirely happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing that really impressed me was the window. I can't imagine cooking a pizza this way without one. No need to constantly open the cover (and lose heat) to see the progress.Then, the two separate heating dials, one for the top, and one for the bottom. Again, not all pizza ovens have this, but this is a winner.Next, the very fast preheat time and that it can reach 800oF. It took only 10 minutes to get to full heat. When it's reached the red lights go out and we're ready to go.Baking for me was only 5 minutes and the pizza turned out perfectly. The bottom crust was crisp and nicely browned, the top was perfect.This morning I made a tuna melt on some homemade bread. I set it to 600oF and put it on parchment paper. That wasn't a useful idea as the paper that extended past the bread burned, but no big deal.I have always made my homemade pizzas in my wall oven at 550 on a pizza stone. That required preheating the stone for almost 50 minutes and then baking was around 8-10 minutes. This little oven does it all in 1/4 of the time and does it perfectly.I understand why this pizza oven is a best seller. The features are terrific and the cook has full control. Highly recommended.Oh, and they also offer a free one-year warranty with registration. Bravo to Piezano!",

                "reviewText": "Very easy to use and professional results. With an easy to use machine like this one, you will never order pizza again. It is fun, and the results are amazing. I have tried one working with wood pellets, and it was never as easy or simple as this one. You just adjust the temperature control on top and bottom and that's it . Don't forget to put semolina on the bottom and it won't stick. The accessories (included) are useful. Great value compared to the other pizza ovens. The only other electric pizza oven that could reach this high temperature is the Breville which is almost 9 times this price.",

We ended up making 3 pizzas the second time we used the oven and they were all delicious, well cooked, and took little time since it's at high heat. Maybe it will take a bit to get it a pizza the way you want it, all depends on your own tastes, but this oven is definitely worth buying... and it's at a great price too.",

                "reviewText": "This appliance is very efficient for baking a single 12 in diameter pizza and has independently controlled upper and lower heating elements for ensuring good results depending on crust thickness and toppings. I like the viewing window on the top to determine the best cooking time and when to turn the appliance off. Although the appliance comes with 2 bamboo laminated leaves for transferring the pizza to and from the cooking surface I prefer to use a separate light metal tray to ensure efficiency and safety. The cooking surface in the appliance is not suitable for cutting the cooked pizza with a metal wheel and the pizza must be transferred to a separate ceramic wheel to cut and serve. Overall, I find the cooking oven very good for making a pizza for two and have had really good results so far (10 pizzas). I have found that the cooking time for a thin crust pizza, made from scratch, is about 4.5 minutes and I do not open the oven during baking. I also have a really good pair of oven mits which I think you need when opening the appliance to transfer the pizza to and from the oven.",
