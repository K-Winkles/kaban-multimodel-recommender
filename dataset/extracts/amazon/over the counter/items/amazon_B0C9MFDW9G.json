                "reviewText": "I wanted to find a \"strainer\" for my son who has a dreaded \"corner\" sink in his kitchen. These seemed like a good solution. And they are slender... so slender that if you put a full size dinner plate in one they struggle to hold it. It works fine for salad bowls, cups, saucers, or lunch plates but anything larger and it's just overwhelmed. The base is a rubber mat so nothing drains - it evaporates. My son has hard water so the crusty buildup is irritating- not the strainer problem just a problem to deal with since the water stands in the mat. It's better than using a towel....",

So this was perfect!It comes with the silicone mat for dripping water, actually came with 2 mats. The rack meets all my needs and serves the purpose for what I ordered it for. I folded a drying mat and put under just in case because I'm extra but there is no leaks or anything. I have had it for a few months now and no signs of rust either!",
