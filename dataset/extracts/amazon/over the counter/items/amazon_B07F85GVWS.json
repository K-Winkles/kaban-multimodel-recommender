Now, after just a week of use, this has been used more than the other dish rack. It is important to measure the sink so that you get the right length and width. I bought another product and it was too big for the space. This one fits perfectly and is very stable. I have put plates and pans on it and it has held well. Super easy to put things on this and not worry about them toppling...saves cleaning the counter top often too. I have not had to clean it yet as it seems to not get dirty easily. It takes very little space when folded so you can stash it easily too.",

                "reviewText": "I'm one of those bear types that loves cooking. It is a safe bet that you will find me in the kitchen working on something or another. When I get busy, I may have three or four things going on all converging towards dinner but especially on Fridays. Bread rising, soup on the stove, chicken in the oven, get a salad started ,maybe bake a cake. Everything I make is from scratch so sometimes I get pressed for time but I also get pressed for a little extra counter space when I'm staging my dishes for preparation.I had been looking for a cutting board to fit over the sink but I have all the cutting boards I need. And the idea of something plastic was just a turn off. But then I saw this dish drying rack and started thinking about how I might utilize it for my purposes. Besides it wasn't going to break the bank when compared to many of the other options that my search presented. So I ordered it and received it today. I am overjoyed with my purchase primarily because it fit my sink perfectly and it folds up very compact ....so it's easy to store. But the one thing I really like is that it is sturdy. I was a little concerned of the sturdiness factor because. it would need to be sturdy to withstand my chopping and dicing.on a cutting board over the sink. I can be brutal while chopping meat or veggies primarily because .I use a meat cleaver for all my chopping chores...whether it's meat or vegetable....I know it's different ...maybe even a little weird ...but it is ...what it is..different strokes for different folks I guess.I live in a rural location so I just want to say thank you to the Amazon driver for delivering my package per my instructions. Plus I received it as promised. I want to add that I have found Amazon to be a pleasure to do business with during these challenging times and I am very grateful for the services they provide especially for all of us living in the rural areas. Thank you.Months have passed. The leaves are falling all around and the autumn moon lights my way...... I need to report that this rack is both durable and worth every penny. I have found it to be great for defrosting meat, preparing salads over the sink....and you know what? it's a nifty way to dry dishes...oh wait a minute..that's what it's sold as ..a drying rack. I have found so many uses for this thing that I don't know how I did without it before. I particularly like useful kitchen gear that is simple in design but turn out to be indispensable after they work their way into your routine.One of the best purchases I made this year. It's all good..",
