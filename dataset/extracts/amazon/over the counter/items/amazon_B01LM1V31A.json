                "reviewText": "We had a GE microwave from 2009 that worked flawlessly, but it was time to upgrade to stainless steel. Since we had god luck with the prior model, we stuck with the same brand. The new microwave is very sleek and clean, straight lines that gives it a very, very modern look. The display is very clear in bright blue. There's multiple options and settings (clock on or off, multiple speeds of the fan, and a cooking light and night light). Overall we are incredibly happy with the appearance, functionality and quality.Since we stuck with the same brand, it made installing the new one an absolute dream. For once, a company decided not to change what was never broken! So while it's an entirely new microwave and looks different inside and out, we thrilled that GE didn't make any changes to the mounting brackets. The mounting kit, templates, parts and installing bag were never opened! We literally set the new microwave on the old wall plate, raised it up in place and screwed it in with two provided screws (even in the same holes, above). It took 7 minutes--not an exaggeration!",

                "reviewText": "We just installed our new unit. It requires basic carpentry skills. You will need a tape measure, a level, a drill and possibly a reciprocating saw or the manual equivalent. It fits well as the instructions say, snug up against the bottom of the cabinet above. The hardest part for me was the connection to the vent duct outlet. I found that standard sheet metal ducting adaptors designed for a range hood are compatible with the oven vent. If you go on line to find such an item, measure the output flapper gizmo that comes with the unit to be sure it is 3 1/4\" x 10\", as mine is .. and you will find multiple adaptors if you search for range hood sheet metal ducting. Here is an example that is available on Amazon: DGT35 Galvanized Round Transition (5\"). It is for 5\" circular duct but there are other sizes and types with the same 3 1/4\" x 10\" rectangular bottom that fits the microwave exactly. If you have to install all new duct, you should probably use the same size as is used with clothes driers, which is 4\".The photo is of the install. It is the second one we have done, this one is in our son's house but we installed one in our kitchen also. a couple of years ago.",

                "reviewText": "Install was very straightforward if you follow the instructions. The templates for the wall plate and top screws/plug hole were spot on! This unit cooks much faster than my old one but a couple of minor complaints 1) it is loud when running. When you use the microwave the vent fan runs as well, sounds like an F-16 waiting to take off. Not sure why this unit does this and my old GE did not? 2) this unit sticks out of my 12\" deep cabinets several inches. I expected this and it is a common look in new kitchens but why doesn't GE make a shallow depth unit anymore? 3) when you close the door the mechanism is louder than it should be and resonates through the door, making it fell 'cheap'. The fan works well and the lights are bright, the clock is very visible.",

Very happy with the function, looks and will cross my fingers on the longevity. I purchased the exact same newer version again only due to the size of a built-in.

                "reviewText": "This is my 3 GE over the stove microwave. The first two I had were wonderful and lasted a long time. We moved recently and the Frigidaire that came with the house quit in 4 years of use. I like this one better but we did hire a carpenter to install it. If you replace an over the stove microwave make sure you get the right size to fit the opening which I did and it fit perfectly.",
