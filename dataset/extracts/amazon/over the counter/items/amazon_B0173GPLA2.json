Everything got caught in those grooves, drying it was a pain, and it was too time consuming and frustrating to deal with on a daily basis in my kitchen. So I got this over the sink style of rack and haven't looked back. It saves counter space, easy to clean, easier to dry, sturdy, easy to store. Love it.

                "reviewText": "Great! Exactly the right size and function I wanted for revamping the available space in our kitchen! This works exactly as shown in the advertising photo. It rolls up and down easily. You can put this on your sink and leave it there (we do) because you can partially roll it and put just one of two items on it...or fully unroll it to do many dishes at once.The main thing I wanted to mention is that we have a small kitchen and do NOT have a double-sink. We have a single, standard-sized stainless sink (and a dishwasher)....so when we hand-wash dishes, we have to put them on a regular \"drying mat\" (that get damp and gross) and this drying rack DOES fit on single-sinks and still allow space for washing dishes and putting things in the sink. I was unsure when I purchased it if it would be useful on a single-sink, but we use it all the time and it's best for our wineglasses and bar-ware that is crystal and we don't want to/can't wash in the dishwasher. I can dry it safely, quickly and reuse as needed easily.The rubber that makes it \"cling\" to your sink really stays put and I haven't found any amount of weight that makes it slip or fall yet. It settles easily into any stainless sink and as much as I'd LOVE a double-sink....I don't have one. And this is a great addition to your single sink for things you don't put in the dishwasher or rinse and reuse frequently (I'm thinking of new moms with baby bottles and tops that are constantly washed and reused).This is a simple, cheap, and effective alternative to drying every dish right away or having a stinky \"drying mat\" sitting out all of the time taking up counter space. I really love our purchase and thought I wouldn't use it much. But it's a permanent fixture of convenience for us now. Highly recommend regardless of your sink size or counter space.",
