It has its own draining board with a spout to drain rinse water right into the sink. The only assembly I needed to do was to add the soft covers to the feet of the drain board so that it does not scratch the counter or the sink. It is sturdy and attractive. I am very pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "Very versatile dry rack for kitchen.It can be set directly into the base of the sink itself, including the drain pan (so you do not have to find space to hide the drain pan if you just use it in the sink.)It also has little arms that extend out sideways so it can hover over the base of the sink as well. It is adjustable so it can fit different sized sinks that way.When fully compacted it is small enough to fit in my kitchen sink (which I have an older home with \"stock stainless\" kitchen sink of average depth).Also, the drain pan will allow you to set it on the counter next to the sink and drain the excess water into the sink at the same time. So if you prefer to dry and leave your sinks empty, it has an option for that too.Overall, makes life easier having a dry rack. Its not extravagant, but its solid and works well for that purpose, easy to fit any way you prefer.",

                "reviewText": "This has worked well for my kitchen. I like that I have several options for placing this drying rack, either on the side or hanging over the sink. It holds my chunky square plates and lots of silverware. It holds my breakfast dishes, containers from my lunch, and dinner dishes. I usually have to wash the cookware from dinner separately or dry on a towel but that's a lot of dishes for a space saver rack. Constructed well and does not feel flimsy.The only 2 things I didn't like about this rack tray were the feet and the length of the drain. The rubber covers for the feet don't fit snug so I have to be careful when moving it or they fall off. I wish the drain was a little longer because the shape of the lip of my sink meant I had to keep the tray right on the edge. I would buy again.",

Well designed, sturdy, and holds enough while also not taking up too much space.Unfortunately, which is in no way the products fault, the lip of our sink is TALL. So the spout feature will not work correctly until we find a way to raise the product an inch. This is something to keep in mind when shopping for a dish rack! Learn from my oops!Other than that, it's a great product and looks very nice.",

Doesn't take up too much counter space, and the drain works exactly how it should.These aren't complaints, just something to mention. It definitely looks smaller in person, and if you're trying to dry multiple pots and pans...good luck. Even getting one in there is a challenge. But I still think it's totally worth the money--heck, it was an early Christmas gift and he LOVES it. (This man is excited when I buy him toilet paper, he's not difficult to please thankfully.)",

                "reviewText": "As described, black with coated handle to cushion against counters. Works best, but not exclusively, with an undermount sink that has faucet installed with single hole directly into counter. It's workable with a sink with a faucet that has a metal plate mount, but the extended support bars will either rest on faceplate, making it uneven--or if not, it will not have as much room to perch (this is the option I choose, and I'm careful). Wish I had this years ago! It holds my cutting boards vertically, it holds my largest pots and bowls. It would not hold those AND dishes, it's more for a person with either a dishwasher or household of 1 or 2 without dishwasher, in my opinion.",
