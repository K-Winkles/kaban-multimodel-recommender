Pieces do not all line up well for assembly. Legs are uneven and on 2 of the 4 I purchased we needed to put pads on the bottom to try to level them out.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered one to see the quality and how it looked in my new kitchen. It took about 15 mins. to put together and is very sturdy. The cushion is much larger and thicker than I thought, but very comfortable. The bronze is almost a dark grey/bronze and looks great. I'll be ordering two more.So...I ordered two more. They were obviously made by a different factory. The second one had very rough welds (a piece of wire sticking out too), did not align and was missing one of the plastic pads on the bottom of one of the feet. Additionally, the fabric of #2 and #3 is slightly lighter in color and the cushion a little less square and thick than #1. #3 went together fine and I will be keeping that and returning #2 for a replacement. It's too bad there is no quality control (and Amazon should get after companies that they stock and ship to do a better job), but as my husband said, just keep ordering them until you get a set you like. It took a little glimmer out of my love for these stools so I changed my rating to a 3 *.",
