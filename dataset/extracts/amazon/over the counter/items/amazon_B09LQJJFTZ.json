                "reviewText": "I had trouble putting this together the first time. So I emailed the vendor and was amazed that they got right back to me as quickly as they did. They even contacted me a 2nd time to check that everything was ok! Turns out this unit is very easy to put together. it took me about 30 minutes and that is with looking at the diagram and watching the video that was provided as I put the shelf together. It probably could have been done in less time, but for some reason, I had the dropsies and kept dropping if not the screws the hex tool to screw them. It was amazingly simple but you have to lay your pieces out like in the video so you don't put things backward or upside down as I did. I discovered these things before I tightened the shelf for the final time so it was no problem to unscrew them and place them correctly. One other thing I found useful was a measuring tape to make sure the legs were even and that I didn't overextend the shelf. I think that if you overextend the shelf and while it would work for holding lighter items it wouldn't keep the 55lb capacity. I could have used a level to make sure it was balanced but I couldn't find it. One thing that might have helped the first time was to have known that the C and D rods are switched in the instructions.For the price, it seems like a decent and sturdy enough shelf. My heaviest items are on my counter while I put medium-weight things on top. I think I could use heavier items but don't have any plans to.I am pleased with my purchase as it satisfies my goal of clearing space on the kitchen counter of my tiny apartment.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to house my microwave, electric tea kettle, and toaster oven. However, I misunderstood the measurements. I thought I could adjust the vertical height of the frame. Although the width of the unit is adjustable horizontally, and shelf placement is adjustable vertically, the total height of the unit is not adjustable. I did not have clearance underneath my cabinets to accommodate the entire unit.Because I don't have vertical space near the only electrical outlet in my tiny kitchen, I am using it to open up counter space where I do have more vertical room.I'm still giving it five stars. It is a solid product. It was easy to put together and it is built to last. It's extremely versatile and can be used in all kinds of space-saving placements. The included hooks hold my keys and utensils and dog leashes at the end of my counter. Overall, an excellent product.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: works great as a space saver in my small apartment kitchen. My toaster oven fits the bottom area perfectly, and my microwave utilizes the top space just fine. The appliances are able to be stored on this rack without compromising their functionality.Cons: kind of wobbly, very difficult to assemble. Honestly, the assembly wasn't \"technically\" difficult as a whole, but the instructions SUCKED. There were just photos and numbered parts, which is fine, but it felt like the instructions were incomplete and lacking info. Once you figure it out though, you got it. The wobbliness could likely be fixed fairly easily by using a leveling device to level out the rack. Since it stretches to expand/collapse as needed, it does not lay perfectly - which is where the leveler could make a difference.Overall, the value for the money IS THERE. If you are looking for a way to save space, THIS IS IT. I love the versatility of this rack, and the ability to expand/collapse as needed for size requirements.",

This shelf is sturdy and gave me the space I needed. The width is adjustable so really helpful in saving a few extra inches on my counter and provides the flexibility to rotate different appliances under and on top. The instructions were a little vague but it wasn't difficult to figure out. It was a little awkward building it but didn't take very long. I'd recommend measuring your height of the items to ensure proper fit. The top shelf has three heights available but if your cabinets are low the top settings are not ideal, unless your storing flat trays. Overall I'd say it was well worth the money.",

Not that you can\u2019t figure it out, but a tiny bit more effort to improve the instructions would save time for the customer assembling it. One of the plastic pieces that screws together two bars broke while I was tightening it. I turned it too far because it didn\u2019t seem tight. It should hold together since it is screwed in on either end, but I used some tape to be sure. Fortunately it is behind the microwave so it\u2019s not seen. Now that it\u2019s set up it is nice to have the shelf space, and we\u2019re not using it for anything heavy. But it\u2019s not the best quality. We wanted to use the 24\u201d width but if you want to use it for a smaller space it might be sturdier.",
