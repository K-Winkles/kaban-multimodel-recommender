                "reviewText": "Product sides and back bars seems pretty strong. The racks, and especially the wire-only ones, a bit on the lightweight side, so don't put heavier items in them, for sure. We have some hefty dinner plates / bowls, and I would not put more than 4 to 6 on this rack. For thinner / lighter-weight plates, especially plastic ones, this should be fine.The black finish is nice - hopefully it holds up over time with repeated water contact. The instructions are a bit lacking in places, as some of the descriptions do not fully detail what the picture shows, so you do need to use a bit of thought to get it together by both reading *and* fully studying the diagrams for each step.One thing that is not really done well is how to handle adjusting the width. The inner \"middle\" bar is just set in each side with no \"stop\" unless you lock one side first. If you are going at one of the wider settings, be sure to lock one side down first, and then move the other side to adjust rack width.Be sure to measure carefully, and not just the width, but also the height of your faucet and anything else on the back of your sink.",

Now I can actually put a coffee maker on my counterthe quality of this product is excellent. I'm not worried about it falling when I put my dishes on it. This is 1 product I had no idea existed until I saw it on Amazon, and I don't know how I never did without it.

It came with a one page instruction and the parts aren\u2019t labeled. After figuring out which parts went where and the rest was an easy assemble. It looks really organized over the sink and you can reconfigure the parts and accessories to your liking. I would recommend giving it a quick wipe down to make sure every is clean before using.",
