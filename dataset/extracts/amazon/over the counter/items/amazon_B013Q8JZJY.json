But things like allergies or cold viruses can thicken it, making it interfere with your breathing and well-being. Dull, throbbing pain located at the front of your face. The pain may get worse when you lean over or bend down, when you touch your face (especially your cheeks or forehead) and might also feel more severe in chilly, damp weather. If your sinus headache comes from a cold or flu, you\u2019ll have other symptoms, too. If you have a sinus pressure and nasal congestion, you might develop a sore throat and experience dry (nonproductive) coughing, or develop a wet productive chest cough. This is due to the mucus running down the back of your nose to your throat, where it can cause additional irritation. If sinus pressure and nasal congestion are caused by an infection, arise in temperature may soon join the mix of symptoms. A sinus infection can trigger some whole-body symptoms as your immune system fights to keep the infection at bay\u2014which may cause fatigue or a fever.",

In this case it worked in my favor though. This Sinus Max has the EXACT SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENTS as the Fast Max product both by Mucinex. So why am I happy? Well this box cost me only $13.04 while the Fast Max would have cost me $15.24 for the exact same thing.Still, I'm a little disappointed that they couldn't figure out a way to name the product in a way that communicated it did cold and flu and sinus all at once, instead of trying to dupe us. Whatever, the meds work so I'll let it slide...this time.So the Day use pills don't make you tired, do relieve stuffiness, sinus headaches, and have an expectorant(which I expect from something with the name Mucinex) the night time pills, will help you sleep, get rid of sinus headaches, and reduce stuffiness, however there is no expectorant in them. Mildly disappointing but oddly my sinuses did still drain at night, so the end result was the same.Overall, this medication worked great to relieve my sinus pain and worked great on a standard cold as well, plus it cost less. A win/win for me.",
