                "reviewText": "Had a nice shelf over my sink however, this just took its place and already had two people ask me about it today. It is such a clever, well needed product for people like me. I love to cook and juice, always having extra dishes. I also like keeping my sink clean and dry. This solves so many issues for me. The product fits perfectly over my sinks. Now i can let things dry while keeping my sink clear. It seems to be well made. Holds quite a lot of things. Was pretty easy to put together. I do wish the rack was more level or at least half level as far as holding dishes, yet it is still very nice. Things outside flat dishes can still go on this rack and it is still a good design. The hooks are a plastic and not metal, yet are strong enough to hold cooking accessories. it holds knives well and is made so that silverware bottom of holder does not get stagnate like some holders often do. All in all I love it. It is really worth getting. I am very pleased and give it a thumbs up!",
