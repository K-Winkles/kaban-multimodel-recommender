It's very modern and sleek. We replaced our faucet about a year ago and they are awesome together.

With that said, I would do again in heartbeat, really transformed kitchen. Deep sinks, awesome!!!!!!Do need 2 to install and is as complicated as it would seem but very doable.",

                "reviewText": "With the final installation now behind us, I am pleased to report this sink, in a splendid way, enhances the overall appearance of my former kitchen. I am so pleased. For the countertop I opted to increase the width to 25 inches to allow for greater clearance for the front and back of sink. The individual sinks are large and are able to accommodate my rather large 14\" diameter iron wok for cleaning.This sink does have zero radius corners which was new to me. My solution is to use Mr. Siga, heavy duty scrub sponge that have cleverly cut corners for cleaning such corners. For cleaning I use baking soda and sometimes add vinegar.The sink does lay flat meaning you really should have a faucet with a retractable nozzle to reach all corners of the sink. I will say more time is needed for cleaning but that is small price to pay for having such a beautiful and accommodating sink to meet my everyday cooking needs. Thank you so much.",
