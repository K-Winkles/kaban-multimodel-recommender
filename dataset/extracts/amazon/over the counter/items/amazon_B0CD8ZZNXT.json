                "reviewText": "This diclofenac works as well as any I have tried. It definitely helps in specific spots and is much better than taking pills. This is easy to apply, it does take a while to dry though. When I\u2019ve use Voltaren, it usually takes 1-2 minutes to dry, this can take up to 10 minutes. Other than the longer drying time it works just as well.",
