                "reviewText": "I was looking for a slim, dimmable light fixture to install on the underside of a top shelf that extends over my desk. Because its slim, I was able to recess it by routing a ~1cm deep slot on a 1.9cm piece of cabinet grade wood, and the light-fixture fit neatly into.It's motion ON/OFF and dimmable, and color-selectable via a slide switch. It mounts with two screws, that are then hidden by covers (included) I had to shorten the screws a bit as the board was thinner where I routed it, but the fixture is very lightweight, so the shorter penetration of the screws was not an issue. I got the 24\" black fixture.I really like the simplicity of this and hope it lasts a while! (only had it a week so far, but use it a lot!) So far, its been perfect!",

They tuck under our cabinets completely out of sight because they are so skinny and the motion feature works like a dream. My husband had them up in a matter of minutes. The plug that goes into the light itself can go on either end of the unit, allowing you to get closer to the wall plug. I love the easy accessibility of the light temperature slider. These lights were a real find for us, great quality, and we highly recommend them!",

Did not use screws, because could not drill into the mounting surface. Used velcro tape. Works fine, but had to boast the adhesiveness by applying \u201cno nail\u201d glue to the mounting surface before placing the tape. Let stand 24 hours before attaching the light fixture (that has a strip of matching velcro tape across the back surface). Happy with purchase.",
