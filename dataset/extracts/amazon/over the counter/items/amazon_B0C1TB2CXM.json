I had taken Tums and drink more Pepto-Bismol than I ever wanted to in my life. I was stuck on the couch, unable to leave because I was so nauseous.I had honestly never heard of Emetrol until I was desperately looking for nausea relief. I found it on Amazon and was able to order my first bottle within a day. I was skeptical about some thing that supposedly relieved your nausea within 15 minutes, but it worked. I still need to take it every so often, but I have regained the ability to live my life thanks to this.",

We have tried some pills and chewables without success or sometimes ability to swallow them while nauseous. I will definitely keep buying Emetrol for my household!!!",
