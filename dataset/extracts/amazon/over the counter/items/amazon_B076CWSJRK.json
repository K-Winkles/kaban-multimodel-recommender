An elephant? Run over by a truck?\u2026 Anyway, I sent it back for a refund (good luck to the next customer who decides to buy \"used\u201d).I spent the extra few dollars and bought new. It fit perfectly, with no space to spare. I put my digital scale on top as planned. I have a small kitchen, so counter space is precious. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

You've simply put it together incorrectly & then blamed someone else for your incompetence lol.With shelves like this, it's important to LOOSELY attach ALL the pieces & make sure it sits evenly on a flat surface BEFORE you actually tighten the screws. K thx.Anyways, I bought this because I have a vintage piece of furniture I use as sorta an extra pantry, but the inner shelves were removed by the previous owner so its just a big empty space and I was stacking things awkwardly until I had a \"DUH\" moment and realized I could just buy a small metal shelf for the inside of it \ud83d\ude02Easy to put together & it feels sturdy. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
