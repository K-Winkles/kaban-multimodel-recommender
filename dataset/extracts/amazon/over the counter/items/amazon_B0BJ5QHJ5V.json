                "reviewText": "Before I bought this over-the-sink drying rack, a large portion of my kitchen countertop space was occupied by a bulky drying tub that couldn't hold many dishes. When I saw this rack for under $30, I figured I'd give it a try, because at worst, I could just combine it with my tub and dry more dishes at once.Assembly of this unit is very easy, and it comes with the screwdriver and spare screws, nuts, and washers in case you strip or round out a couple during assembly. In all, I needed about ten minutes to put it together, and the easy-to-read instructions made it a cinch.The unit itself sticks well to my non-textured countertop, and its adjustable width allows it to fit over narrow, standard, or double sinks. Its three racks hold a surprising amount of weight without bending or toppling the unit, as its center of gravity is on the rear legs and weight is spread to the front legs if the largest of the racks is filled up. I've fit about twenty-five pounds of dishes, pots, and pans onto the rack at once, and that should be enough even for an average-sized household and their daily dirty dishes.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, as it has saved me valuable counter space in my small kitchen, and cleaning the drying rack has only ever required a quick rub with a damp cloth and some dish soap. With the rack designed to drain dishes directly into the sink via gravity, my dishes also dry much more quickly than they did in my tub. This rack is a great value, especially if your kitchen space is at a premium.",

                "reviewText": "I love how this dish rack sits over the sink so the water drips into the sink instead of dealing with a tray under the dish rack. Most importantly, it saves precious counter space. It was easy to set up and it feels pretty sturdy. My dish rack arrived missing a plastic cap on the top of one of the posts but I didn't notice until I had assembled it so I didn't return it. The missing piece doesn't affect the function of the product but I hope it doesn't cause the metal to rust more easily to have the end of the post exposed to water. Overall, I'm very happy with this dish rack.",

                "reviewText": "Works great for what it is, Metal is a little thin so some of the parts may come slightly bent but they\u2019re easily bent back. Personally I use it for plastic plates so I\u2019m not worried about the weight. If you use heavy glass plates I could see the metal thickness being an issue. Building was also super easy although the parts do not have letters on them you have to identify them using the pictures provided. Suction cups also dont really press down unless you have weight on the rack either so it does slide a little if you do not have anything on it. Overall I do still like it!",
