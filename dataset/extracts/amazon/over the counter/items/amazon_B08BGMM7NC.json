I do find that if I can take them right when the migraine starts, they seem to stop it from getting as intense and make it go away faster, but even if I can't do that for some reason, they help reduce both the intensity and duration of the migraine. They don't taste like anything and dissolve quickly; if you get severe nausea with your migraines that might still be a no-go, but I find them easy to tolerate.When possible, I combine them with rest and use of a neck/shoulder heating pad (which by itself helps only slightly but seems to be a really good combination with the medicine), and my migraines -- which left untreated would typically last 6+ hours (sometimes even more than a day) -- are usually done within 3 hours. Moreover, within 30-60 minutes, the medicine makes my migraine manageable enough that I can enjoy a quiet activity and even comfortably eat.Hyland's continues to be my go-to for over-the-counter medicine!",

It helps with the regular headaches as well as the intensity of my migraines. I use in in conjunction with my onset medication or before I start getting a migraine if I feel aura or a headache that will trigger one. It\u2019s not a strong flavor at all, if you even taste it. You dissolve it under the tongue for maximum sublingual absorption. I love that it helps with the sharp pains I get before a migraine attack as well as nausea. It\u2019s something I always keep on hand now.Personally I prefer the old packaging. It\u2019s less bulky and more compact. The new bottle leaks some of the dust in the bottle, the old packaging doesn\u2019t.",

I have migraines probably 3 to 4 times a week. Very debilitating. I swear up and down by these. Please try them. Every person I\u2019ve told about these and has tried them has had excellent results too. Migraines are miserable",

                "reviewText": "I just finished my bottle. The taste was decent, but I won't be purchasing again. The downfall of the product is it's failure to do the one it's intended for- relieve migraines. This product does NOT RELIEVE MIGRAINES! Can you imagine having one of the worse migraines, taking these pills, only for them to not relieve the pain, it really sucks. I see many reviews expressing how well the pills worked for them, I like to believe they have minor headaches or migraines because this product is ridiculous. As instructed on the bottle, I placed two tablets under my tongue, had it melt in my mouth, and every 15 minutes I repeated for 4 doses maximum. Unfortunately for me, even after following the directions on the bottle, my migraines still persisted. Not once did this product work for me",

                "reviewText": "I took this when my migraine started like I knew the signs .. It worked for about an hour . Two hours later - my migraine percolating. Took it again - it took the edge of the migraine but I still felt the pressure of the migraine slightly . I waited and took two every two hours with lots of water .. By the end of the day it was gone .. it\u2019s not as fast as say iburophen . However if you just have a headache this works well. Migranes you have to be patient with the process \u2026 Thst being said - I rather this product then aspirin or ipruphen with all their chemicals abs side affects I prefer this product. I gave it a four because if your a migraine person this product will work but you will still be left with the mild onsets of migraine .. However , prefer this then the alternative \u2026 Also, since taking this product I haven\u2019t really had any recent reoccurring migraines like I did in the past.",
