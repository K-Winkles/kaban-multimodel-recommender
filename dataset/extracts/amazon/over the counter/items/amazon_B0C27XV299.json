                "reviewText": "First off, I want to say the adhesive that comes with the product is amazing! It took a while to pry the product off from its original location. I wanted to move it closer to where our cleaning supplies are. I included a photo of my original placement, on my cabinet.The product came off clean once I got some leverage. I did place it on finished wood, on a cabinet I had, so I'm not sure how it would have been on painted wall. However, im sure the same would occur.I believe i could have just reused that same adhesive, but i wanted to try command strips to make it easier to remove next time. When it came to removing the adhesive strip, it came out like command strips. I tugged on it and it came out mostly in one part.---- about general use--------I use Bounty rolls. They're fairly large but fit just fine inside the holder. The roll never comes out unless i want to take it out. I believe this has great value and is really nice quality.This is super apartment friendly, and I'm happy that it is able to be placed at a variety of angles.If you want a cheap but quality paper towel holder, this is the one!",

Upon looking at the adhesive strip, it made perfect sense and actually made it easier to install. The protrusions holding the paper towel tube are sort of small and the roll really slides too easily meaning I have to hold onto the roll to tear off a sheet. Overall it works for me because it is black with a simple minimal design and hangs under the counter. P.S. I live in my Motorhome, so when I travel I use a small bungee cord across the towels so they don\u2019t completely unroll while moving. \ud83e\udee4",

I was worried it wouldn\u2019t hold a very large roll of paper towel from Costco, but it works just fine. I love the fact that I don\u2019t need to have a paper towel holder taking up countertop space. Highly recommend.",
