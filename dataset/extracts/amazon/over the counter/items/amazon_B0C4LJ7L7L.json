                "reviewText": "I wanted to use the limited empty space above a new microwave to store a box of appliance booklets and loose-leaf recipes. This shelf fit the bill, almost, that is.The adjustable width of the shelf bracketed the microwave perfectly but the height at the first level was too low (about an inch below the machine's top) whereas the next level up was too high; none of my items would fit properly due to a low-hanging cabinet blocking them.Fortunately I had the right drill bits to bore holes between these levels to place the shelf at the perfect height. I noted that all the original holes were punched through neatly. However the vertical legs on one side were indented a little due to too much pressure from the punching machine. I can live with this since you can't see it once the stand was placed behind the microwave.In summary, a third set of holes punched in the legs would increase flexibility of the shelf's height. I really like the matte black finish and the metal alloy is nice and sturdy. The assembly was not difficult. It is handsome storage unit for my needs.",
