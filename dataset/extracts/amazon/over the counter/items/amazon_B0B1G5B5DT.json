During the same project we removed a stainless steel sink that had a drying rack as part of the sink. It was while using the former rack that I liked the functionality of it and purchased this rack. This rack is of much better quality than the one we got rid of. Only word of caution--Please measure your opening as our rack just barely rests over the sink opening. This product is well made and a good price.",
