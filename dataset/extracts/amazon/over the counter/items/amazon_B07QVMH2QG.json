                "reviewText": "I love my Kohler Stages 45\u201d Wide Workstation sink, but it was *very* disappointing that Kohler failed to offer a custom fit drying rack for this expensive sink. The Kraus drying rack fits perfectly on the inside tracks of the Stages sink, and I\u2019m so thrilled. It seems like a quality product. I like how the size of it covers my 12\u201d sink shelf. The slats of the rack are set closer together, which keeps smaller items from falling through. This makes it more versatile for me. It folds up and stows away nicely. For me, this sink accessory is a necessity, so I\u2019m definitely ordering a backup. Shout out to Kraus, for fixing the Kohler issue.",

                "reviewText": "Our kitchen sink is a big, single vessel in our kitchen island. I have always hated having a big, bulky, ugly drying rack sitting there taking up space, collecting mildew, and it seemingly invites piling wet dishes on top of dry dishes. Not anymore! This is really a novel, low-profile solution because it rolls over the sink \u2026 and take up sink real estate while things are drying on it. This is actually a good thing! Because it forces me to put away dry stuff more frequently so I can roll the mat out of the way. It works great, is very sturdy (you can put pots and pans on it), is much cooler and futuristic looking than an old wire/plastic drying rack, and it collapses and rolls out of the way wh en not needed. Just a really well-designed product that solves a nagging problem for me!",

Needed one for my trailer so i cheaped out and bought one without silicone coated bars, which turned out impossible to keep it rolled tight and small. This Kraus folds up pretty narrow and is the right size for the small rv sink. Love that it stays in place, can put a cutting board or hot pans on it and will even work well for draining plates and dishes. Well worth every cent.",

The companies that make & sell these need to do a much better job marketing.I caught a glimpse of these racks on a vanlife YouTube video, The Queen & Bob, and immediately went online to find them. My sink is HUGE so to get full coverage, I had to buy two. As you can see in images, there is a little overlap. I haven't snipped them to fit perfectly because I'm undecided if I like or dislike the overlap or not. I use these in a camper van and with the silicone coating, I can set things on top, drive, and they don't slide. The overlap by having two racks acts as a stop. If I cut and don't like, then Im buying a 3rd so, I'll wait and see.I like these so much, I bought a 3rd rack to put in the sink, replacing the raised metal rack. The metal rack had hard plastic feet that wee marring the stainless plus the new in-sink rack is coated with silicone too so, I can having things in the sink and drive and the stuff will stay put.I love these Kraus racks!",
