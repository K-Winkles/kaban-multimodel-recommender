Magnets are included with no additional purchases. It is the seller and the product that are considered from the customer's point of view. Does anyone know the difference between these under cabinet lights and similar looking lights? From Customer Adeliciasyd: Yes, the cabinet lights are longer than most and are of quality workmanship. Another to my surprise, there are three different color temperatures and three modes that can be selected according to my different needs. How do you feel about this lamp after using it? From Customer Naba : The cabinet lights have larger battery capacity, more LEDs, and longer life. More importantly, they can change color temp and adjust brightness. How long does the battery last after fully charged? From Customer Semie: I think it depends on how often you open the cabinet and if you leave it open for extended periods. The ones in the garage 1 month, the kitchen 2 weeks maybe more.As far as I know,this closet light built-in 2000mAh high-capacity. Is there a guaranty on these? From Seller kenaS: Yes. We will provide a 12-month service for every closet light we sell. If you encounter any problems during use, just feel free to mail us, and we will provide a satisfactory solution for you within 12 hours.",

Things I\u2019d highlight about the product are:* 2 charging cords! (one for each)* Surprisingly very bright but not too much* comes with helpful lengthy stick on magnets\u2b50\ufe0f* Perfect way to save some electricity since it is rechargeable and motion reactive* Lights up dark areas like closets and bathrooms fairly well* Surprisingly far range in terms of the sensor(works better in the dark)* Simple instructions and little packaging wasteI also wanted to mention it works as a regular lamp if you intent to keep the light on for a long period of time as well~ It\u2019s a shame a lot of the time people avoid products with few reviews because this one is actually worth it",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Delivered 7/29/2023 and I\u2019ve been playing with them for a few days now.When I first picked up the delivery box I thought for sure I had the wrong item, it felt much too light. With the box open I was reassured when I saw the packaging. I was totally shocked by the size and weight of these lights. I see that the dimensions are in one of the product photos and in the amazon listing details, but I must have missed both of these. The product photos make them look much larger. However, this is actually a plus. I found these to be quite bright given the size.There are a couple buttons on these lights:Power Button: Short Press: light turns on for a few seconds then back off. Long Press: Light turns on indefinitely.Color Temp Button: Short Press: cycles through three temperature settings (warm, neutral, cool) Long Press: Adjusts brightness up/down.(Check for my video showing the color temp and brightness selections)In my testing I found the sensitivity of the motion sensor to trigger once I am within about 5 feet of the sensor. The light turns off after 10 seconds. It is not extremely sensitive, so when I stood still in front of the light, it would turn off and I\u2019d need to move a hand a bit to get it to turn back on.The light is nice, soft and uniform. I can\u2019t see any individual LEDs. They have good diffusion between the lens and LEDs.In a dark room these put off a good amount of light. I jerry-rigged one in the bathroom for a night light and had to turn the brightness all the way down so it wouldn\u2019t be blinding in the middle of the night. It worked really well for this usage.I charged one up all the way and took it to work with me so I could monitor it. I turned it on with a long press and the battery outlasted my patience. After about 3 hours it started to look like it might be dimming a bit. At 3/5 hours in it was definitely dimmed a bit, but still noticeable in the well lit office. By 5 hours in it was still on but I had to hold it under my desk in the dark to tell for sure it was still on. I thought it was a pretty great battery life, especially considering how lightweight it is.With as small and lightweight as these are, they will easily be able to go in a lot of useful spots with little mounting effort.Overall I am more impressed with these lights than I expected.",

My husband gets up when it's still dark out and normally turns on the bedroom light in my eyes to see what he wants out of the closet. Now when he walks over to the closet...his light turns on and I'm still able to sleep for a bit longer! The best part? They recharge? I had another set that had batteries. I finally gave up because they didn't stay stuck anyways. These are a far better design. I should have cleaned the surface before I stuck the adhesive. One of these stuck and the other didn't but I put it back up with 2 sided tape and now it works just fine. I like that I can easily pull these down to charge them. They really do work great and the different light color is a nice feature too!",

With no outlets nearby, I debated between battery or rechargeable as both are inconvenient. I am pleasantly surprised at how easy these have been. They came with adhesive strips as expected but also optional magnets and metal plates. This way the lights can be easily taken down and recharged with no hassle. I\u2019m also very pleased with the length of time they hold a charge as in the closets they\u2019ve only needed a charge once every couple months. The only con I\u2019ve found so far is that it does take several hours to fully charge each light. But since it\u2019s so infrequently it\u2019s not much of a problem. The motion sensing is pretty accurate and has decent range. The light doesn\u2019t stay on too long after it stops detecting motion, perfect for areas where you\u2019re just in and out. Overall I\u2019m very happy with these lights and they\u2019re a great choice!",
