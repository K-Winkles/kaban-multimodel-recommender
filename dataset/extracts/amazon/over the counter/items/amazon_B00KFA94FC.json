Ice packs are your new best friend. You realize you may not have felt your age up until this signal shut off and on starts and then? 0-60. Mid life chaos.Pure bodily betrayal.Ladies...you know as I do, these are only a few of the symptoms to partake in.I tried this on pure chance, fingers crossed, after searching for the best non hormonal treatments.Less than a week in, I feel the difference.Sweats and flashes of light have decreased, with sleep becoming restful again. I am still hot and cold shifting but it is noticeably more tolerable.Over time, I hope the swelling and weight change goes back to \"normal\".I plan on continuing to take.Only negative is the price. Not cheap....however certainly worth it at this point.I rarely leave reviews but if this encourages another woman to try this and it works, this is time well spent.I was NOT compensated for this review and I paid for the product myself.Update....a few weeks in....I have discontinued use. Side effects were too much to tolerate-headaches and fingers so swollen they were painful.I am very disappointed as this supplement was helping.",

                "reviewText": "So far, so good!! I've been battling hot flashes for the last 3+ years (after a hysterectomy) and I've been miserable! My Dr put me on a testosterone hormone cream last year, and while it worked to stop the hot flashes, it left me with some undesirable side effects. The worst was that I lost all vocal control. I LOVE to sing. I was a decent vocalist, but since the testosterone thickens the vocal cords, I had lost all control in my upper register and became totally unable to sing anything above G below middle C! It sucked. I had almost accepted the fact that if I wanted to control the hot flashes, I wouldn't be singing again. I was mad and scared and devastated about it. I was complaining to a friend about it one night and she recommended the Amberen. I looked at their web page, read all the information,and contacted my primary Dr to see if Amberen would be safe to take along side my other meds. I even called the nurse they have at Lunada Biomedical to ask some questions. The the Dr seemed to think I could use this in addition to the meds I was taking, but the nurse at Lunada said that I shouldn't take it in conjunction with the testosterone cream and the progesterone cream I was using. I had to make a gut decision, and I fearfully discontinued the creams so I could let the Amberen do its thing. The first week I took it, I had just a few moderate hot flashes, enough to spook me, but not enough to bail the new efforts. By the end of the second week, I hardly noticed any hot flashes. I have completed my third week on the Amberen and I'm happy to report that the few hot flashes I've had lately have been quite mild and pass VERY quickly. It is recommended that you take a full 90 days of the Amberen and then go off it to see how long you can go before symptoms return. The friend who told me about it said she was symptom free for over a year. If the symptoms return, they recommend another 90 day course. I like that the IDEA is to get my body back on track so it can regulate itself, and the goal is NOT to have to take the Amberen as a supplement for the rest of your life! (WAY different philosophy than big pharma thinking!) I have high hopes for the success of Amberen. I feel like it has already made a big difference for me. The best part... my vocal control is returning!!! I can actually carry a tune, and I'm regaining the ability to sing in higher registers almost every day! I'm probably about 75% of the way back to normal and improving daily. I can't even express how delighted I am to be able to sing again! By taking the Amberen, I am able to get the excess testosterone out of my system and get back to being ME!",

I would toss and turn all night awaking several times and at least 2-3 times a night awaking due to night sweats. Not to mention moodiness and other issues that come with perimenopause.I started Amberen and immediately the night sweats disappeared and I was sleeping through the night again. On days that I have missed a dose, I end up with night sweats. It's crazy how well this stuff works for me. I highly recommend it to everyone who is starting perimenopause.I have tried a competitors product and found it did nothing to help my sleep or nightsweats. So I am devoted to Amberen.",

May be a better deal on here but feeling disappointed as I Love Amazon for other things. Just maybe not something that I'm putting in me. Maybe It's just me but really feel like it wasn't the product I ordered from the original website although it appears the same and packaging I'd exactly as it was strength etc all the same. Bummed.",

With the exchange it works out much more affordable to get it from the US but I don't have that luxury at the moment. It 1as $159.00 for the 3 pkgs and it's only 109$ with the exchange when I get it in the US. Lets see it go down in price, that would be a bonus. It works for me, and has for over 10 yrs. I have no symptoms, I'm 55 and had a total hysterectomy in 2013 so I have no hormones at all kicking around, but whatever is in this...give me no symptoms what so ever...All my friends are sleepless, hot sweats, cold sweats, no sexual desire etc....Me...I'm ready to roll at all times.
