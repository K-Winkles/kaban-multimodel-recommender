                "reviewText": "I recently moved into an older apartment. It's cute and charming, but the kitchen is small and there's very little counter space for someone who really likes to cook and also hates clutter. Since my microwave takes up so much room on its own, this was a perfect solution to save space and add some additional storage and organization to my kitchen counter. I can now prepare food much easier without having to move stuff around to make space. It was very easy to assemble and everything you need is included. It's also easy to adjust for different sized microwaves (or whatever else you'd like to use it for).",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I needed for my toaster oven. So far it's sturdy, adjustable and clean looking. Two tweaks I recommend: 1. I didn't like the holes in the metal where I didn't choose to insert screws so I cut out some UPS label white sticker packaging into tiny round stickers to cover them. It has worked well and is unnoticeable. 2. I read about the top shelf conducting heat, so I put a rectangular green marble cutting board there. ( my adjusted size happened to fit a board I had ) . The board has small feet so heat dissipates safely. The marble weighs the shelf down and stops any scratches. It is cool to the touch and looks very nice. I have my electric kettle and a plant on top. For me, these two tweaks elevate this item from good to great!",
