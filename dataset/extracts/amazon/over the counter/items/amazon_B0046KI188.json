If you have a sinus pressure and nasal congestion, you might develop a sore throat and experience dry (nonproductive) coughing, or develop a wet productive chest cough. This is due to the mucus running down the back of your nose to your throat, where it can cause additional irritation. If sinus pressure and nasal congestion are caused by an infection, arise in temperature may soon join the mix of symptoms.
