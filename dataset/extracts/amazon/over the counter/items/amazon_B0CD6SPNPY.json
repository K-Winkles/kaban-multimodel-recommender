                "reviewText": "I have a reception desk which is awesome with 2 spaces but makes the lower desk space very dark for working and taking pictures. This lamp is AWESOME! It comes with MANY options. It can be powered by hard wiring OR by simply plugging into an outlet. It also comes with hardware to screw it to the underneath of the counter or desk, but I chose to use double stick tape (not included). On the face of the light are 2 additional options. The on/off switch can be turned to dim to bright (and several steps in between). It also has several different color temps of light. I've shown an image of the desk prior to the light install, then one with the fully bright yellow light, and finally, one with the fully bright white light. Personally I prefer the white light. The dim to bright options are noticeable in person, but less obvious in pictures, so you'll just have to trust me on that. The user manual claims 50,000 hours of life, which obviously can't be assessed. I am very pleased with this unit and anticipate many beneficial hours and uses. I don't think you could go wrong with this item!",

                "reviewText": "This reviews the 24 inch model of this light, which is bright and has nice manual features, such as dimmability and color temperature adjustment.We got it to replace an old 24 inch fluorescent fixture under a cabinet. This meant the option to hardwire the light in using the existing wiring, which led us to discover a couple of minor concerns. One is that the slim and sleek design of the light means that there isn't much room inside for additional wiring. For us, we had to find some way to deal with the extra wiring coming out of our wall.Second is that the two mounting screws are quite thin and so seem to be at their limit to secure the light.The screws also have ~1/2 inch that sticks out beyond the light to go into the bottom of our cabinet, which is 3/4 inch thick. That may be the minimum thickness required to prevent the screw from poking out into the cabinet.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased 3 of these units of different sizes. All provide excellent light. Direct wiring installation is a pain but this was mostly due to the existing wiring. My main complaint is the switches. They are cheap and difficult to use. The color change switches are the most difficult to use and sometimes are impossible to move. Granted, once you have the color you are happy with, you would usually not need to change color.The on/off switches can be troublesome and we use them daily. I hope they eventually do not fail from daily use. The switch issue needs to be addressed by the manufacturer.Edited Review: I left a 3 star rating several days ago primarily complaining about the switches. Within 2 days I was contacted by the vendor/manufacturer addressing my concerns. I was astounded by their response and communication, never expecting a response such as that. I would rate this company 5 stars for customer service and would highly recommend them. I have purchased a lot of \"stuff\" through Amazon, and never been this impressed with a vendor here. I still have an issue with the switches, but feel confident they will improve the switches.",
