You can use a pair of scissors to easily cut the silicone ends of this dish drainer rack to make it fit the exact size you need for your single bowl sink. Want to be hassle-free? We have 20.8'' x 13.4'' or 20.5'' x 15'' size for your choice. Can the dish drying rack fit perfectly around the faucet in my sink when I lay it flat? No problem! You can take out several stainless steel rods as you like to make this roll-up dish drying rack fit perfectly around your faucet and suit different usage scenarios. I have a double bowl kitchen sink, will the 20.8'' x 18.1'' extra large sink plate drying rack work? EMBATHER mat over sink 18.1(L) x 20.8''(W) x 0.36'' (H) is the largest size you can find online. It works for sinks up to 20'' width. You can cut the sink drying rack into two so you can use it in double bowl kitchen sink. Pay half, get two! How to choose the size of the EMBATHER roll-up dish drying rack? Where to measure? Measure your sink ring (or mounting) , NOT the inside of the sink. Make sure you measure sink length and width to find the correct size. When you measure your sink make sure it\u2019ll have a good more than half-inch on each side to grab onto. Are the stainless steel rods rigid or flexible? How much weight can EMBATHER foldable dish rack hold? This kitchen dish drying rack is pretty strong and rigid enough to hold a bunch of heavy pots and dishes while also being very easy to roll up and put away. EMBATHER multipurpose sink rack for kitchen counter can safely hold up to 80 lbs.",

                "reviewText": "Love this product!It seems like no matter how much counter space you have its never enough. This definitely solves that problem.I have a LARGE country style kitchen sink and this is perfect! All the other ones were just to small.(LOL that's what she said, I know dad jokes, Ha Ha, sorry). This one fits perfectly, so its not barley holding on while your straining HOT pasta for instance. The rubber on the ends hold so well. I have pit full size watermelon on it and it hold it just fine. Have not had it move any while using it. Works great just for extra space, washing produce ( just put it directly on the rack and rinse. even cherries don't fall through, letting a strainer sit after rinsing. Heat does not bother it at all. I've poured boiling water over it and its strong enough to handle it, also does not affect the appearance. ex changing color, not looking \"new\". Made from stainless steel so it will not rust, which is great! Not using it at the moment? don't worry about that either. It rolls up nice and tightly and fits just about anywhere. can keep it in a drawer, under the sink etc. rolled up its about the size of an aluminum foil box. I keep mine rolled up and between the sink and backsplash for easy access. I tend to use it every day for one thing or another.This really is a great product! Could really be used for anything. Need to pour a glaze on a dessert? need to rinse fruit? need it to hold that hot pot? it works for that!!! I'm sure you could use it for just about anything if you got creative, even outside the kitchen. Oh you could also cut it if it doesn't fit just so perfect. I am definitely so happy with the purchase and will buy again if I should ever need to, but don't really see that happening.",

                "reviewText": "When I bought my new sink, I saw these on farmhouse sinks & loved the concept. I use it for drying if I hand wash just a few dishes & I lay the dish cloth, sponge or towel over it to dry. It is great for rinsing fruits and vegetables, even cherries don\u2019t fall through it. It gives you extra counter space if needed. It\u2019s advertised to hold 80lbs, but I haven\u2019t tried anything that heavy on it just because I don\u2019t want to chance it, but I have set a strainer full of spaghetti on it to drain with no problems. It seems pretty stable if you make sure that you measure your sink and get one large enough so that it doesn\u2019t slip off the edge of the sink. It rolls up tightly at the edge of the sink if you want to use the sink or you can tuck it away out of sight under the sink. If you are on the fence, try it, I think you will be glad you did.",

It rolls out over my sink as described and withstood the weight of a colander as I poured out the pasta and boiling hot water into the colander- so awesome! I had put the drain mat in the dishwasher- top rack- when I first got it, then again after draining the pasta- came out perfect each time, no issues- love how it folds for easy storage- placed it on a shelf in my appliance pantry\u2026.great product!Caution: do take accurate measurements of the sink area you\u2019ll be using- must be accurate\u2026.side note: I have a double sided sink- it fit across the the 1/2 of the sink that I intended and fit was great- just be sure you place the mat the right direction\u2026.1st time usage, I placed it the wrong direction and of course it didn\u2019t fit, I was so frustrated, but placed it in a different direction-grate facing up and down towards me- worked perfect!",
