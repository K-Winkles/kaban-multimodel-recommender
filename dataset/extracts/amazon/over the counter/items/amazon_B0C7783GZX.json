The hooks to hang it on the door are too short, so the hair tools prevent the door from closing. I had to attach wires to hang the basket lower, then it slides side-to-side, so I had to attach the stick-on hooks that are meant for wall hanging. I would not recommend this item unless you have room for it to just sit on the counter.",
