Easy assembly, nice price point, sturdy, can hold a ton of books of all sizes (see pic for side view). The bedroom door closes with ease and still allows space to open the door completely. The rack doesn't move around, the plastic barrier suction type things help the bottom stay in place but are more buffers than anything. The white rack has a pleasing look next to floating white shelves, in other words it doesn't look so out of place in a room vs pantry. Now the books are visible while saving floor space :) The bottom 2 shelves can be easily reached by a small child. Super happy this worked out so well for our needs, 10/10 would buy again.",

This one is great the one draw back is the screws to help tighten at the top are super long and stick out alot once it\u2019s closed. It holds everything I need mostly spices and has room for some more. The black is perfect with my kitchen decor. I would highly recommend this one it\u2019s a good buy and it\u2019s working great.",
