Please note these don\u2019t come with remote, but they have a sensor that works well. When I want them to stay on for a long time a just turn them to the on position. Also note the photos were taken during the day.",

This light can be manually set to stay on, it\u2019s just that you have to be able to get to the switches to do that. I be started using these motion detection lights in dark kitchen cabinets and they are perfect. They come on quickly when the cabinet is opened and usually you just need that to find what you are looking for and the it turns off. I\u2019ve only had a week, so don\u2019t know how long before I need to recharge, but I\u2019m so glad it don\u2019t have to keep buying batteries. The initial charging (usb-c. Cord included!) seemed reasonable, didn\u2019t take long. Light is more than adequate for a closet or cabinet, maybe an entryway\u2026..",

                "reviewText": "I Bought a twin pack of these lights, and after fully charging both lights, installed then under a counter in the kitchen. Using the stick on magnetic mounting method, the install took maybe 5 mins, with half that time used in deciding how to space them. After a few days use, I decided I needed a bit more light at the counter, and bought a second package of two lights.And so now, with four lights covering a 7 foot counter, the light output is perfectly adequate. However, the battery life has not been good. Many reviewers indicated that their lights would run at least a week between chargings. But I'm getting, while using the motion sensor, 2 days battery life...tops. If I forego the motion sensor, manually turning them on and off, I get 2 to 4 days. While they are quick and easy to pull of their magnet mounts and plug into the supplied VERY short dual 8\" charging cord, they'll recharge in a pretty fast few hours. But for me, going to the work counter, and having two or more lights running dim of completely dead, is not what I expected at all.Mine are coming down and I'll try moving them into service within a lightly used small pantry room and into a seldom used, but pretty gloomy closet.",
