                "reviewText": "If I could give this product 4.5 stars I would. The product is great, it gives me way more room on my desk and looks great but the construction is not as simple as I had anticipated. The two things that stuck out to me were the hook bar and screwing the legs into the bases (not the center pole). The hook bar was a bit difficult to attach since the metal hooks cannot be hung after it has been screwed in. They kept falling off as I was attaching the plate and were rather cumbersome to work around. As far as the actual legs went, I just found the instructions confusing. None of the screws have a head, everything is double sided and that caused a few technical difficulties. Not an impossible feat, but IKEA furniture is definitely easier (in my opinion at least)",

I thought it might have been just the insert itself but when I usedan insert from an unused 3rd level piece it turned out that the hole into which the insert was placed was drilled in at an angle and there was no way to fix that.In fairness the other 2 shelves were O.K. but I had to be VERY careful screwing in the threaded bolts to make sur they wouldn't get stuc and misthreaded. I chose not to return the one bad unit since I found a way to use it where no one is likely to notice the wonkie leg but be careful if you buy one.",
