Normally, the body maintains a perfect balance between the various bacteria and works to prevent certain types of bacteria from getting out of hand. However, this subtle imbalance can lead to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal infection caused by bacteria. This is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in women of childbearing age (women who are not yet menopausal). Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include: \u2022 Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green. \u2022 Foul-smelling, \"fishy\" vaginal odor. \u2022 Vaginal itching. \u2022 Burning during urination.",

It seems to have helped my ph get back on track because it resolved my symptoms but I'm still going to see my OB for a check to make sure I'm in the clear. Some people say that there could be some burning but the package does warn of that in advance--I didn't experience that. I will purchase this again. Since there's only 7 applications, I will probably buy more than 1 package.

I\u2019m not sure what it does but you could have a higher chance of getting pregnant or getting an std. I didn\u2019t see anyone else posting about that though it was important.",
