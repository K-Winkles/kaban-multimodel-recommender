I always keep a lot of drinks on hand, sparkling water, Coke, etc. The boxes took up so much room in the bottom of my pantry and I got tired of fishing cans out of boxes. I ordered this and loved it so much that I bought a second one! it was super easy to assemble... took about 5 minutes total. I will update with a photo later but these really helped organize my pantry and they look so much better than a bunch of drink boxes. They are sturdy and roomy. These would be great for bathroom under-sink storage, kitchen, wherever you have stuff you would like to neatly organize and have easy access to. I will likely get more of these for my bathrooms. My kitchen has a built in one under the sink, but if it didn't, I would get one of these for there too! Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this two-shelf organizer not knowing where I would use it. After moving it several times it landed on my grooming table and a light bulb went off. This is exactly where it is needed. I have a three-shelf rolling organizer but seem to run out of room or can't locate what I am looking for. During the Covid pandemic, I began grooming my Shih Poo at home. It began to be a calming experience for my dog and me. I decided that I would keep doing it and accumulated so many things that were great to use. Many things were very expensive and needed to be taken care of, not buried under a pile of dog hair as sometimes happens. The lower shelf is great for my shampoos, conditioners, and other needed items. I like the top to be devoted to my clippers and scissors, nothing else. Since the top shelf doesn't slide out, the things I need are right there and I don't have to look for them. I can easily locate other items and keep cotton balls and other necessities in the lower drawer. It looks very attractive on the grooming table and I have finally found something that works to keep my grooming supplies organized. I would think of where it would be used to determine whether to purchase or not. If it will be seen, does the black and wood suit your decor? Don't limit yourself to one room. I think this could be a great organizer for many different areas and I like the ease of assembly. I have not had any problems with the unit and would purchase this again.",

It moves well, and once you set it, it holds... until you add weight to the top shelf.The photos in the product description show a full gallon of water on the top shelf, which weighs just over 8 lbs. We had much much less weight on there (maybe a pound) and the shelf scissored itself down and was resting on top of the products on the bottom shelf.If the photos are to be believed, I got a defective shelf. I guess, take the 100lb weight capacity with a grain of salt.",

                "reviewText": "I have an extremely small kitchen with limited counter space. This space saving storage is exactly what I needed to organize my pantry and counter space. The shelves are durable and the plus is it genuinely holds a lot of weight. I don\u2019t fear any of my mason jars crashing to the floor by this item falling apart. It has made grocery shopping more enjoyable. In the past it was a task because after the trip to grocery stores I spent so much time trying to figure out where to store the groceries due to limited space. This solved that problem! It\u2019s now happy grocery shopping for me!!! I\u2019m very happy with this item. It solved the problem I had with limited space. Thank you! Very happy!",

                "reviewText": "This shelf is very handy and the fact that you can adjust the height makes it great for a variety of uses in the kitchen and out.-Instructions and assembly were very simple-All the materials seem pretty sturdy and hold up to a decent amount of weight without bending or bowing.- After the initial super being stuck the drawer slides nice and smoothly.-The wood handles make it much easier on the hands as opposed to some of these that just have you grab the metal.-The top can flip up if need be.- There are notches/hooks on the bottom to adjust the height of the top. Once set will not move of its own accord.- The legs and feet are very sturdy and it stays in place great.Great addition to any space that could do with a bit of organizing. The quality of the materials combined with the versatility of the self and the price make this a decent buy.",

                "reviewText": "This shelving unit is exactly what I was looking for to store my coffee mugs and all the accessories for the coffee area in my kitchen. I REALLY wanted to like it. The overall aesthetic is nice. One shelf pulls in and out for easy access and I love the fact that you can adjust the height to 3 different levels. However, as soon as I opened the package I was disappointed. As you can see in the photos, one of the \"wooden\" pull handles was completely broken into 2 separate pieces. I was frustrated but kept moving forward. Following the included directions, it was relatively easy to put together by myself. All of the walls are held together by popping into clips. As I was putting the last wall together on the bottom shelf I ran into another problem and this one couldn't be overlooked. One of the clips was installed incorrectly or is just plain faulty. It's shown in 2 of the attached photos. The wall will NOT stay clipped in so the entire bottom shelf falls apart and makes the unit useless. I tried using pliers to push the metal clip together around the corner of the wall, nope still wouldn't hold. It looks like the clip was attached at the wrong angle so there's absolutely no way for the wall to clip together \ud83d\ude1e",

It is pretty large in depth and width be sure to measure where you will put this. The bottom slides out like a drawer and the top will swing up so allow a little headspace for that if needed. Very easy to put together. Love it!",
