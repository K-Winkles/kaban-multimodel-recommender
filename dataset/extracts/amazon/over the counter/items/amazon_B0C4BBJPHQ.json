            "DETACHABLE LEGS: We have installed 4 detachable legs for this type of cutting board, allowing it to be used as a traditional cutting board on kitchen counters, as well as placed on gas or electric stoves, provide security protection performance.",
            "PRACTICAL AND MULTIFUNCTIONAL: The front 90 degree corner design, with a height of 3.3 inches, allows it to be firmly placed on the kitchen countertop. Thanks to its oversized size, it can also be placed above the sink and fully cover it. It can also be a beautiful cheese plate or food tray.",
            "SOPHISTICATED CRAFTSMANSHIP: The very flat surface is not easy to damage the knife, and there are no cracks or dullness, no bamboo chips when cutting, and no scratches and marks on the cutting board.",
            "EASY TO CLEAN: Simply rinse under warm water and a mild detergent, dry immediately, do not soak or wash in dishwasher.Occasional use of mineral oil on the inside will help maintain its appearance."

                "reviewText": "I love the size of this. However, the functionality is not great. In order for it to sit level I have to install the \"legs\" that came with it. The issue is when you need to take it off to use your cooktop you can't just sit it on the countertop. You have to take the legs off for it to sit flush. The legs are very annoying to position so they stay. So taking them off & on multiple times a day is a no go for me. So as you can see from my pics I leave the legs off now. But it doesn't sit evenly like this.",
