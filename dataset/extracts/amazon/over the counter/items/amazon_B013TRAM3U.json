I am pleasantly surprised that they work! My daughter has a UTI (diagnosed by pediatrician) and I got these to track her progress. Photo is of her test result compared to mine (I do not have a UTI). Hers changed color within a second (confirming what we knew). I'm looking forward to using these over the next week as she gets better. Peeing with a UTI can be uncomfortable and she's a toddler so this has also helped with getting her to pee (she wants to pee in a cup and see the color change). Whatever works to make her feel better...these work great!",
