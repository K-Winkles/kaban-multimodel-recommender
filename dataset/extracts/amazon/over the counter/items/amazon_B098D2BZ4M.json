It's worth every penny. It opened up the whole corner of my counter which gave me so much more space to use. It doesn't get water anywhere but the sink so it's designed well. It holds a lot more then it seems too. I love that this includes the pan and lid drying area, so many don't have that option. My sink is a double sink that is 33.5\" wide, I had trouble finding one of this quality that extended wide enough. This one expands to 35\" and has suction cups to keep it from sliding around. It just fits. The pot and pan section has dividers that can be moved to fit the size you need. This is definitely high quality for the reasonable price. It would make a great gift too. Just make sure your sink is 35\" wide or less. It even has a dish towel drying bar which is really nice because it keeps it from dripping on the floor or counter top.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! I have a garden window that faces our bird feeder that I did not want to obstruct, but did want to clear some counter space in a key area around our sink! This foots that bill wonderfully! I was concerned about how sturdy it would be. So far I have loaded it up with no problems there and all of my cleaning tools and products are close at hand and organized! Gotta try this if you are looking for a great way to organize an otherwise messy area of your kitchen!",
