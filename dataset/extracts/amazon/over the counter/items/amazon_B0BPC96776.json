Sticky pads are super strong and assembly is really easy just make sure you have all measured out before you stick the pads on, they really suck on the surface strong! From a far you can\u2019t even see them because they are transparent, really neat, the hooks are narrow so you can\u2019t hang anything that has too big handles. In my example I overcame this by just using zip ties for my measuring cups, looks anyway better when they dangle freely. Super useful 5 out of 5",

It will get warm, not hot, less than 100 degrees. As far it appears to be adhering well, but it has only been a couple of days. I will update this review if that changes over time. The two racks come wrapped separately in one package. Each comes with two adhesive patches to have it with and one extra patch per rack, so there are two extra adhesive patches if the ones initially installed loose their adhesion.",
