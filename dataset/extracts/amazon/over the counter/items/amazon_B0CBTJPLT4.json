As soon as we slide the door open, the light turns on and we can see exactly what's inside. The light is bright (but adjustable). The fact that they are cordless and rechargeable is great! And the slim design is nice, too. I would definitely recommend these lights, in fact I already have to my neighbor :)",

I\u2019m waiting for a replacement to see if this is just a fluke but I have a feeling this is just how it is quality-wise. It is convenient when it works so I may just keep them turned off and only use as needed.

Works fantastic and stays on just long enough for me to get what I need and go back inside the house. I used the remainder of my two sets under the kitchen cabinets. It's so nice to have some soft light in the mornings and not use the harsh light of the overhead fixtures. There are different light brightness options and you can set them to steady on or motions detection. This was a really fine product at a very, very reasonable price.",

Luckily, some 3M mounting adhesive squares did the trick and we were good to go after charging the lights.This is a handy item and I heartily recommend. Overall, a very high quality product with several brightness and time settings. The charging cable could be longer but that was not a deal-breaker. 4 star rating due to mounting trouble and cord length, but lighting performance is top notch.My best advice is to have some 3M mounting squares at the ready to ensure adhesion or gravity will win.",
