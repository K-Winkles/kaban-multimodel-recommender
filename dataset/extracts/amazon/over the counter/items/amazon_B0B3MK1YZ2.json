                "reviewText": "This bucket is easy to use and IS SURE TO BE USED (the most important factor!!) due to its ability to be hung just about anywhere that's convenient, thanks to its dual hanging system. I have mine hanging on a drawer adjacent to the most used section of the kitchen counter, so it doesn't take up any counter space (a guarded commodity in my home, due to lack of it). It's a perfect size (will hold all scraps and peelings from a large vegetable soup), has a good size handle that keeps your hands clean when emptying it, it cleans up exceptionally well (no odors absorbed or left behind), it's light weight, the lid controls odor very well (even from onions!), and, something the description doesn't mention, there is a handy removable insert that easily fits on the rim to hold a plastic bag liner in place, if you want to use one. I find this bin cleans up easily and doesn't absorb odors, so I don't use one (wasteful, anyway). I also love the color- a gorgeous green. I am very happy with this recycling bucket!!",

For me this is the perfect size for that use and because the lid is a separate piece there is no hinge to fail and no little nooks and crannies around the latch and hinges that can collect waste while being very difficult to clean. So much happier with this simple little container. The collar that holds the bag is simple and effective. This container completely meets my needs in a simple and easy to clean product.",

Comes with adhesive & hooks if you want to mount it on the side of a cabinet. I just keep it below my sink and grab it when I need it. It has a rim to place over the bag so it doesn\u2019t slip down and the lid is easy to remove. It\u2019s a perfect size because you really don\u2019t want anything larger and then need to wait until it\u2019s full to remove it \u2026. That may get stinky. Highly recommend, made of durable material and I love the color.",

                "reviewText": "Got the teal blue version. 1.3 G size. It hangs inside our cabinet door under the sink from top edge of door. The door doesn't quite close with the hanger in place, but I am okay with that -- our kitchen is not super fancy. This replaces an aluminum flour bin that we kept on the counter. The first bin rusted out. This gives us room on the counter. We have had no issues with smell. We maybe go up to 5 days or so between emptying the bin. The cover is not air tight by any stretch, but it closes well enough, and in conjunction with being under the counter, behind the door, keeps the smells at bay. It has a handle which makes taking it out to the compost bucket much nicer. The handle doesn't feel like the most sturdy thing, but so far after 4-5 months, no issues. There is a ring on the top edge that you can use to keep a small bag in place. We dont use that feature, and the ring adds an extra step to cleaning, but it is is minor inconvenience. For what we were looking for and how we use it, it's a solid 4.",

                "reviewText": "I previously had an OXO compost bin that I liked, but my cat figured out how to nudge the lid up and eat dangerous snacks from it. So I got this one, which requires human fingers to lift the lid off, and the cat has not gotten in. It's slightly larger than the OXO one too which is nice. It seems less sturdy (plastic is lighter) but it is holding up fine so far. I really like the hook on the lid so you can rest it on the bin when you are actively using it.",
