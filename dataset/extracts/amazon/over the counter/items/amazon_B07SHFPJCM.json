                "reviewText": "This product is well designed, likely not stainless steel as advertised, but chrome plated. It fits well in a traditional sink, and many users will not use the expandable facets of this strainer. The rubber on the expandable arms is a nice feature. Be aware-that the utensil holder is only secured by two points. Placing larger untensils, or too many utensils in the holder will cause it to \"flip away\" scattering your items in the sink or onto the floor. This is easily fixed by making a hole in the bottom and adding a cable tie-but this prevents the holder from being removed for washing. In a larger sink, the holder can be mounted on the outside of the strainer, creating more room for items to dry. Overall-a good product, but not perfect.",
