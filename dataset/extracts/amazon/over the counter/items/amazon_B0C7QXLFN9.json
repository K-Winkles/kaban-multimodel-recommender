I was able to make it work by moving the base squares out so they only use 2 poles each rather than 4 and create a wider base. Either way, like that or as pictured and instructed,I found it to actually be very stable,easy to build, and held basically as much as my generic wire shelf did. It's a big upgrade and I'm very happy.",

I personally chose the Narrow, over the faucet, tiered organizer due to having limited space. The organizer was very easy to assemble - just pop in the sticks as shown in the accompanying diagram and voila! It is a sturdy product so long as you don't overload it with weight - I have about 4 full bottles of perfume on the top tier and it holds steady. Great selection of organizers available.",

This is better suited for a single faucet sink but I'm still quite happy with the item. Very durable plastic with heavy pins. Had it together in about five minutes. Tip .. insert the metal rods into the two smaller pieces first. Flip the larger section upside down and insert. Otherwise, you'll likely become frustrated trying to line it all up. Would recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I want to be honest. There's a constant battle with my wife over the living space in our bathroom. I don't know how or from where, but new jars, tubes, brushes, and other items that my wife claims are vital seem to appear on the sink with remarkable regularity. What you see in the photo is only a tenth of what is stored under the sink and in the bathroom itself. According to her, each jar and tube is essential and she uses them multiple times a day. So, getting them from the drawer or under the sink is very inconvenient for her.When I found these shelves, I was incredibly happy. The thing is, I constantly knock over these jars, and some of them end up on the floor or even in the sink, either spilling in the sink or breaking because my wife forgot to put the lids on. This purchase has been a lifesaver for me. Now, the space around the sink is clear, and I can wash up without fearing that I'll drop something on the floor, only to hear my wife later complain about the cost and how crucial it is for her to look beautiful every day.Men, if you want to make your wife happy, buy these shelves. Women, if you want to calm your husbands, buy these shelves.P.S. The assembly process took less than 3 minutes, and even a five-year-old can handle it.",

This makes it so that this holder doesn't fit firmly against the whole counter. It is very easy to assemble, but it honestly is not very sturdy at all. If you try to lift it up from anywhere other than the bottom pieces, whatever you're lifting it from will just come out.",
