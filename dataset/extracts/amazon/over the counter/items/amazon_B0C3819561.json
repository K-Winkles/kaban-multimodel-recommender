They are packaged well and there are no chips on any of the coasters. There are 2 of each slogan. The stand it comes with does NOT have non-slip feet but it is also sturdy and looks nice. I'm looking forward to giving this to my friend.Update: Friend loves them.",

I got them so people would see them and clue in that i want them to use a coaster and it certainly works well for that! The only thing is, one slight bit of juice or something colorful and its stained. I wiped mine down minutes before spilling juice on it and it didnt come clean.I do have to say, i\u2019m impressed with the quality. My cat dropped one off the table and the top part cracked completely in half. The bottom of the coaster (the soft part that sits on the table) stayed perfectly in tact so it was easy for me to super glue the two pieces back together. You cant even tell it was broken.",
