                "reviewText": "I just purchased a house that has a smaller kitchen than I'm use to and needed to find a dish rack that doesn't take up much countertop space. I'm so glad I found this over the sink rack! It opens up so much extra space and adds a new shelf to store larger kitchen items (or oddly shaped items)!Three small things I love about it:-This rack comes with a small basket for sponges, soap, etc. which keeps my sponges clean & dry when not in use-There are separate slots to keep utensils from kitchen knives so you don't have to worry about your kiddos accidentally grabbing the wrong thing and cutting themself.-It comes with a spot to put cutting boards/lids vertically which helps them dry quickly AND keeps them from taking up a lot of unnecessary real estate",

                "reviewText": "So glad I bought this gadget.Pros:More counter space now that I don\u2019t need drying racks taking up space.Looks awesome, makes me feel like a middle aged boss lady.Once assembled, seems pretty sturdy.Dishes, cutting boards, knives, etc all have a convenient home and place to air dry without making my house look extremely disorganized.Makes my adhd cleaning fits 10/10 more fun when this thing makes my kitchen look this sophisticated.Cons:I cut the crap outta my hand pulling this guy out of the box. It\u2019s clear that manufacturing is speedy and cheap, as there are MANY sharp corners on parts, so assemble carefully. The metal is strong and seems sturdy, but also the screws dented screw holes just from hand-tightening them with the provided Allen wrench. I\u2019ll definitely be avoiding any overloading, but then I really only wanted it for the dishes that don\u2019t make it into the dishwasher when it\u2019s full or already running.I haven\u2019t needed to yet, but I imagine that the plastic/clear panels will require cleaning and I can already tell just by how lightweight they are that it will require extra care to avoid damaging them by mistake.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this dish rack frees up a lot of counter space and is one of the nicer designs compared to the rest on Amazon. However, the dish rack itself doesn't fit large plates, and doesn\u2019t look like it can hold a lot of weight.Assembling was not a breeze! There were some panel gaps about 2-3 millimeters on the shelf and door. As much as I tried to disassemble and reassemble, I came to conclusion the screw holes must be misaligned. Although a minor design flaw, the worse part was the plastic drip tray which was completely warped and not at all useable.",

This is the best product I have bought in years! It's very sturdy! The suction cups on the bottom of the legs work to well! We tried to move it after putting it together and it was hard to get the suction loose!\ud83d\ude02 It's very sturdy! Its also super easy to put together! It took me probably 15 minutes at max! I moved all my dishes to it and put my mixer and coffee pot on top. I'm not worried at all! I believe it can hold a lot more weight! I love it has a spot to store my cutting board. If you have thinner cutting boards you can store multiple! I love all the extra little storage spaces that comes with it, the knife box, the soap tray, the box for other utensils, and the hooks I hang my measuring spoons from. I definitely recommend this strainer! I use it as a strainer and a cupboard for my dishes.",
