                "reviewText": "This organizer shelf is a BOMB because it\u2019s adjustable, and you can use it turned like a 3-tier white corner shelf or straighten it out and use it as a regular tiered shelf. I was surprised by its versatile design and the way I could choose to add space through its arrangement or let it be. It\u2019s made out of bamboo, which is a lot better than cheap MDF, especially in humid environments like ours (Caribbean) It looks really pretty and holds up a lot of jars and bottles.The entire set-up came with easy-to-follow installation directions, making it possible to arrange it in minutes. I like the hooks added to the side that improved the storage options considerably. And for so many functions, it\u2019s surprisingly cost-effective.",

The only gripe I have is that it stains easily and I don\u2019t like that, I wear make up and sometimes when I am washing my face off and go to grab a cleanser, my makeup could get on it. And when I clean it up it won\u2019t always come off easily. If it keeps staining I will probably use contact paper or something similar to decorate it because it is very durable and sturdy and as I said, looks good on the bathroom counter. And it was VERY easy to assemble",
