The corner shape makes the whole space on each level accessible for frequent use, so no losing things in a hard-to-reach void.Setting it up was the easiest thing in the world, the legs pop out like they WANT to be in the steady position.Another benefit of the triangle shape - incredibly stable with no wobble, even if the legs might sit a little unevenly in grout lines on my ceramic tiled bathroom counter.I've been on an organizing and de-clutter kick, and this is one of my favorite purchases because its usefulness is more than worth its reasonable price.",
