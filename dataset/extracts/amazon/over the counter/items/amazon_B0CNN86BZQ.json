                "reviewText": "I debated on whether I wanted a slim dish rack or a full size and I'm glad I went with this slim one. I use a dishwasher most of the time so I really only need a small rack for the few occasional dishes I clean by hand. This takes up hardly any space at all so it's perfect for my needs. It looks nice too. I like that it comes with a rubber mat, which you could even use separately from the rack to dry more dishes like cups, while the rack sits on the sink with plates and utensils.Even though the plates overhang from the sides, the water drips down to the middle of the plate and lands on the mat, so no problems with larger dishes.I like that the rack can sit on the sink with the utensil basket removed or even hanging from the side. This little rack is versatile.Everything feels very durable. The mat is quite thick and strong. And there's nothing to put together, so you just take it out of the box and it's ready to use.One thing that might have been nice would be if the mat was angled to pour water off the side and down into the sink, but I personally don't need it. Just something I thought worth mentioning.",

Dishes, saucers, bowls all fit fine. Since my mobile kitchen is stocked with plastic, the fact that the rack is hard metal isn't an issue. There's room for dishes for 2 or 3 people most of the time. The silverware holder is big enough. The only problem would be if your sink is not flush with the counter. Setting this rack on the counter with the silverware holder over the sink (which is one way it can be used) will tilt the catch tray, perhaps enough that it wouldn't hold enough water, creating a mess on your countertop.",

Moreover, it does have sufficient space for a significant amount of dishware and silverware. The current price point of $17.99 is extremely reasonable. I highly recommend purchase of this product.",

                "reviewText": "This dish drainer is great for my tiny kitchen. It takes up so little space beside my sink. It is well made with stainless steel covered by a heavy plastic. The silverware drainer is removable and easily usable on a table or counter top. It has a heavy plastic tray to collect the water drained. I would like it if there were a spout or opening in the tray so the water automatically drained into the sink and so you don't have to empty it.This is very useful and I like the way it looks, the black against my steel sink. It is very durable and will likely last for a long time. It is a good value and worth purchasing.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am temporarily living with my father. Recently, his dishwasher stopped working. In the meantime, we are hand washing dishes (a tedious task let me tell you!). I got this drying rack cause before we were putting dishes on towels to absorb the moisture. This drying rack is not bad but also not the best. I find that most plates don't stand up straight (like shown in the stock photo). If you put bowls/cups on this then it takes up the space where you would have put plates on it. So basically you can either put plates on there or bowls/cups, not really both at the same time. You can slide the silicone tray out from underneath this and put the drying rack across your sink if you chose to. It does have plenty of space for silverware though. I feel the size of this would work well for a small countertop.",
