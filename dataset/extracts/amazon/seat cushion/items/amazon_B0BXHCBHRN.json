But I haven't been disappointed. The fabric is good and appears to be of good quality.The bottom is non slip so it doesn't slip off the chair which is good. The cover can be removed to wash the cover which is very hygienic.All in all I would highly recommend purchasing this chair seat if you are interested in improving your posture and making your workspace more comfortable.WFH has become a lot easier now. Thank you.Was also delivered a week sooner than anticipated initially.",
