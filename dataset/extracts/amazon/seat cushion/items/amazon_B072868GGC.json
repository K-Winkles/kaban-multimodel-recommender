After a few days of using it while driving I noticed a huge difference my back was not hurting alot and my butt felt better after those long drives.

So, I was happy to try this Fortem seat cushion!Immediately I saw the innovation and different approach to offering comfort. I also liked:* fairly light weight* handle to easily carry* non-skid bottom surface* washable cover* use for business or social occasionsWhile the above is all true, where I am usually seated for long periods, I have already purchased seating with extra cushion already implemented. So, for me it was overkill in my car or office chair. But\u2026Excellent for wooden or metal benches and other hard surface seating \u2014 like my patio chairs.It\u2019s a good product and good value for the price.",

The size is ultra generous & conforms perfectly relieving me of leg numbness that I get from sitting . It aligns my hips by its shape . The material is breathable so It stays cool . I used it as a neck support one evening & it worked great for my aching shoulders & neck from gardening . It may not fit everyone\u2019s neck . It\u2019s perfect at the office & super convenient with the carry handle. It fits my cars & with the non skid grippy back it stays right in place . I\u2019ve enjoyed its benefits at the side of my pool also & look forward to bringing it to the bleachers at my grandchildren\u2019s soccer games . This seat cushion has made a huge difference for me . I would recommend if you have sciatica or numbness in your legs , sore hips , if you sit all day , travel . It will make you so much more comfortable.",
