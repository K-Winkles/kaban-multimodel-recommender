The bottom is supposed to be non-slip, but I am constantly adjusting the cushion and moving it around on my chair all day long. I suffer from severe back pain and this didn't help with my pain, nor relieve it. Also, make sure to let it air out before using it as it smells terrible when you take it out of the package due to it being foam.",
