It stays put and that is what I wanted. I am very satisfied with this product. I use it on my office chair at home and I recommend it to those who are looking for a comfortable cushion.",

Seat cushion is thin and I feel the attachments underneath, so had to purchase a cushion. Although it was a good price, next time I would have gone to a better quality and comfort. It says \"excellent support\" -- there is no support.",
