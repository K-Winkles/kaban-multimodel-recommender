To my dismay the gripper underside was showing at the top of the cushion. The color is more of a tweedy brown. I am returning these. Next problem, I have to pack and tape the box. Only the cushions won't fit the box, I called customer service and was told I have to provide my own box. The FREE RETURNS is wrong, unless one can vacuum pack the cushions to fit the original shipping box . UPS will SELL me a box.",

                "reviewText": "These are not too thick and not too thin. The bottoms have non-slip material on them, and it really works. These don\u2019t slip and slide on my wooden chairs. The color is ivory, and it has some dimension to it (which I\u2019m hoping will help hide any stains!) the only thing I\u2019d change is the tie straps. They have both pieces of the tie on the same side of the cushion - but for my chair it would have been better if each side of the tie was on either corner of the cushion. That\u2019s really a very tiny suggestion and not a complaint though. My adult daughter came for dinner and did a butt wiggle and then a smile of approval.",

Be careful that the chair isn't too tall then there would not be space for your legs to fit under while sitting. Additionally, they were vacuum packed well so the box was not as large as you would think.Pros:- easy to install by tying on the back on both sides of each chair- soft but not too soft, and thick enough- non-skid backing so they do not slide offCons: none so far",
