                "reviewText": "I injured my tailbone recently and my Dr said to get a pillow like this. First I bought the least expensive one I could find, figuring I could scale up on quality and price if it didn't do enough. It didn't. So I got this one instead, which at the time I ordered it cost almost 2x what I paid for the first pillow.Sadly, it's a lateral move, not an improvement. It just doesn't cushion enough to protect my injury and the foam seems to compress too much. It's far better than no cushioning at all, just not enough for my needs. And annoyingly, since I ordered it the price has dropped to match the bargain-quality pillow, further proving that this is on a par for quality with the first one I bought, not an improvement.But on the positive side, the strap to attach it to a chair is really helpful for keeping it in place, as are the non-slip dots on the bottom. The cooling gel is nice too, and it does seem to help keep me a little cooler than sitting on the plain memory foam cushion. Overall, I'd say it's probably better for helping to prevent tailbone pain from developing than for protecting a tailbone that's already injured.",

                "reviewText": "I have a mesh office chair that is supposed to be ergonomic but at the end of the day, it isn't comfy. Adding this cushion, I can tell I'm sinking in almost the full height of the cushion (I'm 5'5 and about 170 lbs.). Besides being comfier, I can also feel the cooling gel which given it's in the high 80's where I'm at, it's a nice touch. If you find your car seat, office chair, or any other chair isn't quite cutting it, I highly recommend adding a cushion to bring new life to it and extend it's functional time in your life.",

I sit at a desk for approximately 40 hours a week so my desk chair needs to be comfortable and this cushion has made it so much better! The combination of gel and memory foam provides support while contouring to your body. I do wish it was just a little bit firmer, as I think I \"sink\" down just a bit too much and would be more comfortable with a bit more firmness.",
