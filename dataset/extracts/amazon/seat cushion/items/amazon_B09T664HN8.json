                "reviewText": "My office chair at work is 12 years old and perfect for me. But due to COVID-19 restrictions, I can't be there and am trying to make due with my home office chair, which is comfortable, for an hour or two, but not well suited for all day support. Things were getting sore, really sore, by the end of each day. Limited shopping for a new chair revealed that most are still way too big for me, and more money than I want to spend for what I hope is a temporary situation (four months in). This mesh back support has an elastic strap that slides over the back of the chair and is adjustable up/down for wherever you need it. It's not too bulky and gives a little under the weight of my back when I lean into it. It doesn't make my back sweat. And I can work without getting sore. That's the best part.",
