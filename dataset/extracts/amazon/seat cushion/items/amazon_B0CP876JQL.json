The first day may be tolerable, but the next days are soooo hard to get comfortable! This seat cushion is the perfect solution. I love the fact that it's foldable and light so it's easy to carry. I appreciate the handles, they've come in pretty handy.So I've tried this little thing a few times now and low and behold~ I don't get back pain when I use it! The gel cushion is very comfortable! The black side has a non-slip friction that prevents the seat from shifting which honestly is so needed when sitting.Overall this seat cushion is very practical. I love using it and I can tell it will last quite some time.",

I put the non-skid side down, and can kneel comfortably while bathing the dog. Which is great, because I have to wait 10 minutes with flea soap on him to get it to work properly. Yes, it does fold up and have carrying handles, so I could take it if we go on a trip as well. Is perfect for me, and would be perfect for mom's/grandma's etc. who have to kneel next to the tub to bath children, but have a hard time with their aching knees. Much better than being on the tile floor! The gel is very thick and accommodates for the knees perfectly. Might even (with its carrying handles!) work if I wanted to take it to church and kneel there! They have kneelers, but they are no way as comfortable as this gel. I'm very happy I ordered it, and even if I just use it once a month to give the dog a bath, it's well worth it to save my arthritic knees from further pain and injury. A+ awesome from this gal.",

The cushion folds out to a decent size for one person. One cushion could also work for two children to share if need be. The gel is noticeably soft to sit on. It is very comfortable. I appreciate that the cushion folds up smaller (in half) for traveling. The handles attached to it are also helpful for grab and go situations and easy to pick up off the ground.

Its has a unique structure ensures that helps keep the softness and breathability. I am looking for something to reduce sweat and discomfort during my daily prolonged sitting, but more so the portability.The cushion comes with a removable cover, helping to keep it clean. Its compact design, with a handle means it will be easy to transport and then storage. The non-slip bottom design adds when on more slick surfaces.",

It\u2019s just the right size for the chair and has adequate cushioning. I also found other uses for it such as athletic events where bleachers and stadiums are uncomfortable and sometimes cold.",
