The extra inch would've given the coverage I really needed. It is still better than the other ones I have which are around 17\".",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cushion to make a car seat more comfortable. I drive a 2006 Honda. The wheels haven't fallen off yet, so why is the driver seat so uncomfortable? Maybe it has always been that way, and my younger self didn't care. That said, I had a long drive to make, and I just didn't want to do it. So I bought this cushion based on all the other good reviews, and I was not disappointed. It worked great!Pros: it fits the car seat well. It has this nice handle, making it easy to care to the car with my stuff. Didn't spill the coffee. When I got out of the car after an hour and a half travel, I DID NOT have to stand for a couple minutes to let my hips and legs quit aching. Okay, it's an old babe body, but we don't have to look like that, okay?Cons: I'm not mad at the Honda anymore, which means I won't be buying a new car anytime soon. Hmmm. Maybe that's not a con. . .Others have noted an offensive smell associated with this cushion. I didn't notice that. If I do, I'll be sure to revise this review.",

                "reviewText": "This vision is a lovely bright purple just like the picture and does have the handy handle on its own carry bag. Very nice to take anywhere you need to sit. My spine is basically shot and my bones are too. This cushion works well in my recliner chair and relives pressure on the spine and you get to feel lot better. It will work on any chair and your buttocks feel very comfortable. I also have a rollator walker and works good for it too. Ihaven\u2019t squashed it and the cushion is still doing its job. It does squash and when you get up it goes right back in place. I\u2019m amazed as lim no twig. Hope you will enjoy for a long time. \ud83d\ude0a",
