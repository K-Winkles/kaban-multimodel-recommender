                "reviewText": "I'm a teacher, and let's just say that my district doesn't provide a generous budget for teacher desk chairs, so the padding on my chair left a lot to be desired. While I don't spend a lot of time sitting during instructional periods, most of my planning and grading time are spent in the chair, and this cushion is a game-changer.The cushion adds a lot of padding and provides a much more comfortable experience, but it does increase the height a bit, so the chair and armrest heights needed to be adjusted to compensate, but the comfort was worth it. It's squishy but remains firm and supportive, and it molds well to the somewhat awkward shape of the chair's padding. The strap works well to secure it to the back of the chair, and grippy bottom keeps it from sliding around.This was a great option for turning my uncomfortable desk chair into something I can actually use.",

                "reviewText": "I appreciate that the seller packed the cushion well, and it came in a reusable vacuum seal bag. The cushion is soft, yet it has some support. I am heavier than the 200 lb limit so I will have a different result than someone within the weight limit.However, the size is slightly shorter than I expected. I am not using it on a wheelchair, but as added height padding for an office chair that lost some height adjustment capabilities.The cushion comes with removable webbing that hooks to both sides and has a quick-release connector to keep the cushion from slipping off the chair as you get out. It is created to connect behind the back of your chair. The package also has an extra cushion cover; one side is smooth and soft to the touch, and the reverse has small plastic dots to help with airflow. The covers have a zippered closure, making removing and replacing easy.Besides being smaller than expected, this is a good cushion; just be aware of the weight limit to get the best cushion size needed.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this type of cushion for a while now for my sciatica and decided to treat myself to a new one for Christmas.It came vacuum packed in a very compact box which was impressive to start with so had high hopes. There was an odd valve on the package to inflate the packaging and remove the cushion which was also fascinating. No instructions are given so it took a moment to figure it out.Once unwrapped you notice both sides have a different texture with the bumps acting in an anti-skid feature. This also came with extra cover and a strap to keep it in place if used on an office or wheelchair.I was eager to give it a go but was quickly disappointed unfortunately. It collapsed immediately and offered no support. I guess it would make sitting a wee bit more comfortable but it did not meet my expectations for support and ease the pain from sitting. If you just need minimal support, or comfort, this might do the trick. If you need medium or more support I would suggest looking elsewhere.I would try another product from this supplier if they enhanced the foam to be more supporting but as is I would take a pass on it in the future.",

I have those industrial cafe-style chairs, that are \u201cpadded\u201d but everything hurts when I get up from them. The cushion does add some height and at 5\u20195, my feet were no longer sitting flat on the floor (important support), but a small 2x4 scrap piece of wood as a foot stool fixes that.",
