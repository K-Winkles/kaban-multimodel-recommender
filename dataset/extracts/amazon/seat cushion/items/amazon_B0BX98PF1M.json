I am in constant pain and will clutch at almost anything I think will help.This cushion offers some small improvement simply because it adds extra padding. However it is too small; it only covers about 2/3 of the surface of my chair seat.It is also very firm, which doesn't help the comfort level. A little bigger, a little softer, this rating might have been 5 stars.I expect that if your problem is associated strictly with the coccyx it would supply more relief due to the cutout in that area.",
