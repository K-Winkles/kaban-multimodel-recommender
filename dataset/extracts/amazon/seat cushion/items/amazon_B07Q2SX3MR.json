                "reviewText": "Pleasantly surprised by this product. 1) Packaging was well done. Since its memory foam it has some weight to it, so it came vacuum sealed in a plastic bag to reduce weight and package size, and then placed in a reuseable cloth, zippered bag that can be used to store other items. 2) Fit nicely in a midsize SUV and also a sedan. The bottom as little rubber textured 'dimples' to it stays in place in the car seat, and it also has an elastic strap to secure it to the bottom of the seat. No need to reach under the seat to clip the strap, and it's designed to strap around the back. I thought this was well thought out. 3) It made the seating position for the driver much better. 4) Only one thing to be aware of is that if you are in a very cold climate area, the memory foam does become firmer/hard, and cold, so you may not feel comfortable. Otherwise a good product. Would recommend.",

This is important because the passenger seat air bags wouldn't engage until it was tight. Maybe just my Kia Telluride though. Better comfort than just the plain passenger seat. Elevates you some. Others who have ridden in that seat don't realize its there until I tell them. Still using it after 7 months. No wear or tear yet.",

I chose these because they weren\u2019t TOO thick and wouldn't cause my feet to dangle. (I\u2019m short. 5\u20193\u201d). It felt great. And I liked it so much, I ordered a 2nd one for my car. It stays in place without having to tie it on, which is great when I want to use the seat warmer. It\u2019s easy to move. But it stays in place when I sit on it and it is preventing my hips from shifting and pinching when I make turns. And it helps reduce my hip pain on longer drives. It\u2019s just what I needed at a good price.",
