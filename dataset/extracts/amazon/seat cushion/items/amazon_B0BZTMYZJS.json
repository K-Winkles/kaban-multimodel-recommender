                "reviewText": "The product feels very well made, and the fresh cloth feels very nice unlike some rough mesh that I've felt before. it also comes with a second velvet cover that is silky smooth. The foam insert feels very supportive and is comfortable to sit on and the back pillow supports my lower back very well. One thing I'd like to mention is that swapping out the cover is a bit tricky. You'll want to bend and shape the foam insert so it fits as far forward as possible into the cover (kind of like putting a foot into a rolled up sock ) but once you fit the insert into the cover, the fit is nice and snug. Overall, I'd say I'm happy with this purchase.",
