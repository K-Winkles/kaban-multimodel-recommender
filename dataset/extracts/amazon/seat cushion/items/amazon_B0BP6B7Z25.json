                "reviewText": "I was very disappointed when I unpacked this thing. I use a lift chair and with just me sitting in it in the same spot all the time the cushion has become very uncomfortable. I also sleep in the chair so comfort matters. I remembered how comfortable the gel cushion my mother had was, and that is what I thought I was buying. I looked at this and decided to try it. It is not thick and it is not gel, but it does seem to cushion the seat in my chair so that I am comfortable again. I keep a towel wrapped around it, and I pick it up and flip it over and around frequently. It is not heavy. It is two layers of honeycombed flexible plastic. I'm not sure how or why it works but it does seem to work well.",

Tried these for several days but they still felt uncomfortably hard after 30 minutes. Even my husband disliked how uncomfortable they were.Wanted some cushioning due to c cancer issues but found a pillow offered more comfort. Tried the cushions on my bed but threw them on the floor after 10 minutes. Ended up putting pillow inserts in the covers and throwing the inserts away.",
