                "reviewText": "The first thing that impressed me about the cushion is its superior build quality. The 3-inch thick cushion is generously sized at 20 x 16 inches, providing ample room for comfortable seating. The thick gel padding is strategically designed to distribute weight evenly, relieving pressure from sensitive areas like the coccyx, sciatic nerve, and tailbone.One of the main reasons I chose this cushion was its ability to alleviate discomfort and pain. I suffer from occasional tailbone pain, and the seat has been a true savior. The gel-infused foam conforms to my body shape, providing gentle yet effective support and reducing pressure on sensitive areas. Even during extended periods of sitting, I no longer experience the pain I once did.Beyond its pain-relieving properties, this cushion excels in terms of breathability and temperature regulation. The gel material allows for better airflow, preventing any buildup of heat or discomfort during warmer weather. Additionally, the soft and durable cover is easy to clean and maintain, ensuring hygiene and freshness over extended use.As a bonus, the cushion's non-slip base prevents it from sliding around, providing a stable seating experience. This feature is especially helpful when transitioning in and out of the wheelchair, giving me added confidence and security.Overall, the cushion has exceeded my expectations. It delivers on its promise of exceptional comfort and pain relief, enhancing the overall quality of my daily life as a wheelchair user. Whether you're seeking relief from tailbone pain, sciatica, or simply looking to upgrade your seating experience, I highly recommend giving this cushion a try. It's a small investment that will make a big impact on your comfort and well-being.",

                "reviewText": "I previously bought a different wheelchair seat pad and immediately returned it because the cover tore the first time my husband sat on it. Its cost was only $10 less than this one. That makes this pad look even better for the price since it has a nice nylon top cover and a slip resistant bottom cover. It also has a sturdy zipper for easy removal of the cover for washing. It is heavy, but has a nice carry handle.",

I have to bolster it with other cushions to \"fill in\" where it has completely compressed and changed shape so it really isn't comfortable to sit on. Where I need the most support and comfort it has FAILED. I have tried pivoting it 180-360 degrees to find a spot that hasn't lost its volume, but no luck. I would not recommend this item. I have tried other gel cushions, but they all seem to have the honeycomb design, which IS NOT adequate. I want a solid 2\" thick gel cushion, but I've had no luck finding one.",
