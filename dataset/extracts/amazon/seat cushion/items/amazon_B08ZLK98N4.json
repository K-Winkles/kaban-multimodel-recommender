It is memory foam but thin\u2014it adds comfort, though it\u2019s not going to make a hard chair into a cushy throne. The cushion itself is fine, but beware of ordering unless you are CERTAIN it\u2019s what you want. I purchased this to add a little cushioning to a wooden chair I was going to use with a desk. Unfortunately, the chair ended up being too low to use comfortably and was replaced. When I went to return this, it\u2019s only free return if I take it to Kohl\u2019s, not UPS. I do not shop at Kohl\u2019s and it is out of my way to go there, so my alternative is to box the item (which came vacuum sealed in a bag to begin with, so no original packaging available) and pay 6.99 for UPS to send it back, which is one-third the price of the item. This is not the manufacturer\u2019s fault and takes nothing away from the cushion\u2014it\u2019s very nice and as advertised. Just be sure it\u2019s what you want unless you want to jump through hoops or pay to send it back.",

I haven't had to remove the covers to wash them since we are generally neat and haven't had spills. They grip the wooden chairs very well, even without being tied to the backs. We occasionally have a 3-legged dog over that needs a chair as a boost to a bed, so I bought another one for that chair to take away any slipping and sliding as she jumps up. They are super comfortable, and I'm a comfort princess! I also love the little bit larger size to fit my chairs.",
