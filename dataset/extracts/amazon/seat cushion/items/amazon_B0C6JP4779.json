It isn't perfect, but definitely worth keeping. It isn't too hard, nor too soft. It is relatively thick and has the right amount of \"give\" IMO to provide very good comfort and tailbone relief. The only thing I would have done different, if I had designed this seat, would have been to make the cutout [at the tailbone] a bit wider...but so far I've not had any tailbone issues with this,....so it may turn out to be \"perfect\" after all.Updated: It's odd. I purchased another one, because I liked the first. But the second one seems to be made a little different. It seems to be getting flatter as I sit on it [I'm 160 lbs].",

                "reviewText": "I ordered one for myself as I felt I sat too low in the seat. It not only blocked the sun more it is extremely comfortable. I just drove 3 1/2 hours to my sisters and I was the most comfortable as I have ever been on that trip, and she tried it and fell in love with it too so I bought her one.",
