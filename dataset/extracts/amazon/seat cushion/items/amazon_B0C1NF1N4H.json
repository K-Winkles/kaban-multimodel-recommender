This raises you up off your seat a good bit, obviously, but if you have limited room under your desk for leg placement, or the arms or headrest of your chair cannot be raised to compensate, you may find that the new seat height is not conducive to a good seating arrangement.Instead of looking at the center of my computer monitors, I was looking at the top.The memory foam is decent, but is VERY stiff; feels like sitting on a board, in firmness.All of these were helped by reducing the height by 1.5-2 inches with a really long, and very sharp, knife; cutting off from the flat bottom.I also opened up the hole in the center and cutout in the back at the same time.The top is very ergonomic and supportive of my hips. I am fairly skinny, at 5' 8\" - 160# and the seat fits my bottom well. Someone with wider hips & bottom; the seat will not be wide enough.The seat cover is removable and washable and is a nice material with little nubbies on the underside to keep it from sliding around.The design is nice, it just didn't work for me without modification.
