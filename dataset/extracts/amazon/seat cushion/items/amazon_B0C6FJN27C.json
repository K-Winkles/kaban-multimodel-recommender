Obviously, to save money, but also because I could tell it was going to be a lot like that other brand that costs an arm and a leg.Mine got misplaced, but Amazon took care of it and had a replacment sent right away.Ever since I got it, I've been using it for my computer chair. What I've noticed is, I sit up straighter. It is quite comfortable. I sit at my desk for hours at a time. This cushion really helps with keeping my back from hurting from hunching down.I'm definitely a happy camper and feel like I'm the winner as I didn't have to fork out over $100 for the other one. As far as I'm concerned, this is the one best for me and my pocket book.Original Review Done: 6/04/2023",
