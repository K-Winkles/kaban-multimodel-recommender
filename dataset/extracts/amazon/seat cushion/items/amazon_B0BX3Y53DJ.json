                "reviewText": "I bought this for my computer chair because the chair i have was hurting my behind if i sat too long. Was looking for a little more cushion. This does pretty good. The only thing I don't like is that you kind of need to line up with it every time. You can't just plop yourself down whenever. Plus after a while it does flatten out the way you're sitting and the memory foam doesn't quite go back to where it was to 'recalibrate' unless you get up and let it puff back out. Overall it's comfortable and works, but it's annoying. Might look for something more solid next time.",

I have to sit at computer for literally 8+ hours with very few breaks, and this is a life saver. Very comfortable, fits well in chair -- I got the XL size (measured chair which is a big wooden kitchen chair that I'm using in my home office). Thickness is good, cutout for sacrum is excellent, VERY happy with purchasae.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a number of these. I've unfortunately been in two car accidents in the last ten years (both times I was stopped at a light and struck from behind) and they caused back and neck injury. I've not been able to sit comfortably since and really need the extra support when sitting for a long time. I have cervical cushions from medical supply stores and this is by far the best one I tried. For me this really gave a cradle for my tailbone and the suspension gave relief to my spine. My posture was better because I wasn't actually sitting on the coccyx and I was able to work for an extended period without having to shift or adjust my position. I think the raised curve in the front also helps tilt your pelvis at the correct angle and I like the non-slip bottom because when I did wriggle/adjust my seat it didn't slide around underneath me. Some older ones I have will be replaced by this as I like to use one at my desk, another in my car, etc. It's lightweight enough to carry/move but I prefer not having to bring it in and out every time I want to use it. There's tons of these out there and I've only tried about five different ones from Amazon this one is my favorite and I will be ordering another one! (Maybe two)!",
