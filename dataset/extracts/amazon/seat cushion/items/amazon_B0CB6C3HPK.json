                "reviewText": "This cushion is nice and thick, has the superior combination of gel AND memory foam, and is substantial. The cutout design totally eliminates pressure on your tailbone. Which is everything when your tailbone hurts. It's worth its weight in gold! It's very comfortable. Now, I'm not gonna lie, because of it's height, it can take some effort to get positioned properly on top of the cushion if you're sitting on a bed but once aboard, the payoff is more than worth the extra effort. This cushion is definitely not inexpensive but the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" certainly applies here. Well made, comfortable, and does what it's supposed to do. If you need a tailbone cushion, look no further, your search is over. This one is the one to purchase.",

It keeps my butt cool it keeps me cool and I don\u2019t have a sore butt when I get up and I sit at my desk 10 hours a day. So if you\u2019re looking for great cushion, get this one.",

I just received it last night and sat on it for a minute and literally I was shivering. Not my thing really but if you like to keep your hip area cold; this is a great item for you.",
