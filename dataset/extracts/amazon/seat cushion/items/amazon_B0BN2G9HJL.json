            "\u3010large enough\u3011 Compared to the ordinary cushion, this larger one achieves 19\"*17\"*4\". wider, deeper, as big as a car seat, and perfectly compatible for use on large pickup trucks. It also fits most office seats and wheelchairs. The anti-skid rubber particles can fit firmly with the seat and even the leather seat\uff0c it will not slide at all.",
            "\u3010Helps to see over dashboard\u3011 The thickness of the seat is more than 3 IN. So, it can make people with short stature sit at the height like a six-footer. Very easy to see over dashboard without trying to crane neck for height.",
            "\u3010Solution for back problems\u3011 Filled with filamentous polyester the inside of the cushion is divided into several areas for excellent stability. The front end is relatively soft, does not raise the legs, and the rear end is soft to medium, which improves comfort while relieving the pressure on the tail vertebrae and reducing back pain caused by sitting for a long time.",
            "\u3010Removable seat cover\u3011 Very easy to machine wash. Open the zipper, then take out the cushion inner and throw the seat cover into the washing machine just like you would normally wash clothes.",
            "\u3010Protect your car seat\u3011 You won't be afraid of hot seat in summer and cold seat in winter. Whenever you enter the car, this cushion will always give you a proper temperature."

                "reviewText": "Bought this to make driving our new motor home much easier for my wife. The current seats do not adjust up so this seat pad allows her to sit 3 inches higher. It stays in place with non slip surface and is very comfortable. Just what we needed to improve her posture and driving experience.",
