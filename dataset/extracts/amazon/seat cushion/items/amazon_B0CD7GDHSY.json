While soft, they are much firmer and give better support than stacking the thinner ones. I had assumed they would be just thicker, the added support is a bonus!***************************************I neither received nor solicited recompense in any form for this review. I am a retired computer/network/telephone repair technician with more than 35 years experience. I have taught all these subjects at my employers in-house trade schools in addition to my field experience. Currently I repair/restore guitars and guitar amplifiers to support my guitar collecting habit. As such I perform electronics repair as well as some woodworking involved in repairing guitars an amplifier cabinets. I attempt to repair most items if they fail out of warranty, so my reviews may contain information you will not not find in other reviews. Solicitations to change or \"enhance\" reviews are always reported to Amazon without exception. Free items or money are joyfully accepted, THEN IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO AMAZON!! THANK YOU!!!! The observations are my own without any outside influence or input. Your experience may differ from my own! Do your own research and comparisons prior to purchasing, don't rely solely on my observations. I recommend purchasing only from Prime sellers as much of my experience with \"marketplace\" sellers has been negative. Often drop shipping from China to the USA, and reshipping so it has a USA postmark. That said, do your own research prior to purchasing any products from the Internet!?",
