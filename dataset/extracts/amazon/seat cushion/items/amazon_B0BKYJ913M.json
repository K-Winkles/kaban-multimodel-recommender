                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Crafted from a combination of gel and silicone materials, this cushion offers an exceptional level of elasticity and comfort that has greatly improved my sitting experience. One of the standout features of this cushion is its unique construction. The gel and silicone materials used in its design provide a remarkable level of support and cushioning, making my chair instantly more comfortable. The cushion adds approximately 2 inches of extra thickness to my seat, which has made a significant difference in alleviating discomfort, especially during long periods of sitting.I have found that this cushion is particularly effective in addressing issues such as butt-soreness and back pain. The added height and supportive materials work together to distribute my weight more evenly, reducing pressure on certain areas and promoting better posture. This has been a lifesaver, especially during those days when I'm required to spend extended periods at my desk. In conclusion, the gel and silicone seat cushion has proven to be an indispensable addition to my workspace.",

                "reviewText": "It didn't do the best job for what I needed at first. I had to partially heal before getting any benefits. Now i can use it happily and with relief. It really does a good job of spreading out the pressure of sitting a long time. I have to sleep sitting up too. The therapeutic cushion I had to get to allow me to heal is too bulky to allow me comfort in sleeping. This one does the trick just fine. I will also be using it to NOT have this problem when i am completely healed, so i don't get it again.",
