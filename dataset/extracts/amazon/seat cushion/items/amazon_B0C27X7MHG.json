                "reviewText": "Got this for those long, 10+ hour car trips, where having a nice supportive cushion means making less stops to stretch legs and get blood flowing. Worked great. I appreciate that it comes with buckles in the back to prevent it from sliding around, and other than when it's left in the sun it feels quite cool to the touch. Shallow enough that it doesn't raise your seat height too much, but thick enough to give that much needed cushioning.This review is for GSPSCN Car Seat Cushion Memory Foam,Heightening Wedge Chair Pad for Short People Driving,Butt Pillow Pad for Coccyx,Tailbone,Sciatica,Lower Back Pain Relief in Car Seat,Wheelchair,Computer Desk,Office",
