The approximately 2\" thickness of this cushion is plenty. It is comfortable and the non-slip underside keeps it in the chair (I also scoot the cushion against the chair back).The rear side of the cushion does not seem to be contoured as described, and there are no straps or tabs to fasten it to the chair, but those things aren't deal-breakers.",

I was getting desperate so I looked one more time to see if i could find another one to try. I ended up finding this one but the price was so low that I hesitated to buy it, but I did.I could not have been more surprised to find it was absolutely perfect for me! This chair cushion is great and gets mi highest recommendation!!",
