The more comfortable they are, they more I need a better stiff back and for my behind.The use of lumbar support pillow is recommended for back pain and other ailments. I have used a regular pillow which is silly and now a days visible to my Zoom audience. They really hope I do not fall asleep on my pillow. The problem is aggravated now because of a high-end mesh chair, which makes my pillow trick look cheap and obvious.This product aims to improve the posture by providing the necessary support both for your back and lower part of your body.This two -piece package consists ofa. The top portion that attaches to the back of the chair using an adjustable strap and clasp.b. The bottom part is shaped like a seat cushion.The build quality is strurdy and the foam filling can be removed for the covers to be washed. The contours hold well as you can see from our picture. The pillow set definitely improved my posture, elevated my eye level and provided a better support for body.One problem I did notice: the seat portion is for regular sized people and not people who want to cover the entire seat, especially if your chair is larger. The second issue is that the bottom cushion is not secured and can move in the initial days until it is 'set'. Not withstanding these problems, I still believe this is a must-have for IT workers who sit all day in a chair and need better back support.On balance, I think this is a well-made product deserving four stars.",

Let's start with the seat cushion. Crafted from high quality memory foam, it contours perfectly to my body, providing unparalleled support to my tailbone and hips. The ergonomic design promotes proper spinal alignment, relieving pressure points and preventing discomfort, even during extended sitting sessions. But the real star of the show is the lumbar support pillow. Its adjustable straps make it a breeze to attach to any chair, ensuring a snug fit that stays in place throughout the day. The contoured design provides targeted support to the lower back, effectively reducing strain and promoting a healthy posture. I've noticed a significant reduction in back pain and stiffness since incorporating this lumbar support into my daily routine.",

                "reviewText": "This seat cushion is very comfortable to sit on. The memory foam is cushy, while still being supportive. And the bottom has little beads so it won't slip.I wish it was a little larger. It's roughly 18 inches wide by 14 inches deep by 3 inches high. So it could fit on almost any chair. But I would like a couple of extra inches in each direction so it would fit me better.However that being said, it is lightweight and compact so it's easy to take with me. And there have been so many times when I was eating in a restaurant sitting on an uncomfortable wooden or metal chair or bench, and I couldn't wait to leave because it was so uncomfortable for my arthritic hip. And I was wishing I had brought a pillow to sit on. So this would be a great cushion to leave in my car and use for situations like that. It turns a hard flat chair into a padded chair.And it's a nice feature that you can take the covers off both cushions to wash them.I tried the lumbar support cushion and it was not comfortable for me. But I am never comfortable with an extra pillow behind my back because usually it makes the seat feel shorter. But I believe that someone who likes to have a lumbar support cushion would really like this cushion.The back cushion comes with a strap in the back so I guess you could strap it to a chair that had some openings in the back. But I don't think it's necessary.So all in all a good set of cushions for anyone who needs a little extra support.",
