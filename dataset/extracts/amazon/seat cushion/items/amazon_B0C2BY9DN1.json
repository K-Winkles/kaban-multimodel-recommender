Most backaches can be prevented or cured with the correct sitting position. Even the back pain felt in bed can be traced back to incorrect posture during the day. How do these cushions help? Our cushions helps you sit straight with your back aligned, preventing slouching of the back or anterior tilting of the pelvis which most commonly lead to back pain. With these cushions, you won't have to constantly think about correcting your posture\u2014they do the work for you. Are 2 cushions better than 1? Our cushions complement each other. The Seat Cushion (the one you sit on) helps distribute the weight evenly over the buttocks and prevents chronic tailbone pain. It also encourages the right amount of pelvic tilt to keep the spine straight. The Lumbar Cushion also keeps the spine straight, providing support and comfort to your back. Are the cushions hard or soft? The cushions are hard enough to provide support and maintain their shape, but soft enough to be amazingly comfortable. Can I wash these cushions? The cushions are enclosed in a machine-washable cover, which can be easily removed by opening the zippers on each cushion. Always wash with cold water and air dry. The memory foam core itself should never be washed. Are these cushions waterproof? The cover of the Seat Cushion is waterproof, meaning it won't let fluids sink into the memory foam inside. The Lumbar Cushion is not waterproof \u2013 it does not need to be.",

                "reviewText": "My husband is 80 and recently had 3+ months going through surgeries and time in a Rehab facility. He found that when he had to be in his wheelchair for long, his rear and back would ached and sometimes even hurt. the usual cushions just didn't do enough. I went on Amazon to find a better cushion. This one seemed to offer the most comfort. The nurse he had at Rehab said it was the Cadillac of cushions! When he had to endure long rides in the transport ambulance to the hospital, he would be uncomfortable by the time he arrived. Traveling around the hospital in the chair in addition was very hard for him to endure. When we got the cushion, he said it was such a relief. Of course, he would rather not have to be in a wheelchair at all, but until he is fully recovered, it is a marvel. I can take him to his doctors appointments without worrying about his comfort. This cushion comes with a back cushion also which is such a comfort for his back. He gave 5 stars on this!",
