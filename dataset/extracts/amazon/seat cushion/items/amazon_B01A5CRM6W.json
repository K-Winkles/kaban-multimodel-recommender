The form inside the cushion is pretty hard so it's not very comfortable.3. The size of cushion is pretty small compared to other cushions I have owned.4. Only 75% of the price will be refunded since the seller requires me to pay for 25% restocking fee to return this item.I hope this review is helpful.",
