                "reviewText": "This cushion is an amazing addition to any vehicle!!! I always suffered from tailbone pain and lower back soreness after sitting in a vehicle for extended periods, until I started using this cushion. My first test of this cushion was a 7 day 3500 mile drive and I had zero tailbone pain and no lower back soreness at all. Even with 12 hour days sitting behind the wheel I was pain free. These cushions are so amazing I bought one for my other vehicle and recommend them to my parents for their road trips. The removable cover is nice too, for washing if/when it gets spilled on and the non-slip bottom keeps the cushion firmly in place while driving. For anyone questioning if this is as good as it sounds, this is worth every penny and then some. With as good as this is in a car I am sure it will perform just as well on an office chair for working long hours too.",

I decided to use it on my task chair at my computer and it has been perfect! It increased the comfort of my task chair so much it\u2019s like I\u2019m sitting on air. Plus the material has even support so my sit bones aren\u2019t feeling any pressure crom the seat. So glad i have this! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I want to start my review by saying that I have recently made several upgrades in my life, including a new bed and pillow, which I got a few weeks before getting this pad. Those things seemed to be helping my chronic back pain slightly, but sitting at my desk at work was still killing me.Today is my first day using this pad and after 10 hours sitting most of the time, no pain. I am going to see what happens and update over time but first impressions are that this thing is extremely comfortable and may have just fixed a problem I've had for years.I've tried lumbar supports and stretching routines, but today I am pain free for the first time in many many years.Only downside is that the pad is a little narrow for my wide butt. It doesn't seem to matter much, but an extra couple inches wouldn't have hurt.",

We had a few of those sciatic nerve cushions where there is a cutout in the back, and that seemed to work fine, but they are a bit bulky.So I started looking for something a little more practical. I found this one, which is not so thick, and covers the office chair fine, but sadly is no different than sitting in the chair by itself.I'm sure once my bottom gets a chance to heal up, this will be useful for using at event where we are sitting on benches, and so on... but as a treatment to lessen the pain as I heal, it does nothing.",
