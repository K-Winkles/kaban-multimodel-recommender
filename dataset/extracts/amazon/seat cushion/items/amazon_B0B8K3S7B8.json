Its soft material and double-layer honeycomb design provide super comfort and breathability. The gel seat cushion is suitable for any place such as home/office seats, truck seats, and can provide services for the general population. The customer is most concerned: 1. A lot of people feedback that cushions are so hard, not soft enough, but the seat cushion need to give us enough support to relieve the pressure on the ischial bone, so its not very soft, suitable for most people, and its not that the softer the better 2. Products allow 1~2 cm manual measurement error, a lot of people said not as description, I understand the feelings of customers, but this 1~2 cm error does not affect the use of the product. 3. Many people said its so small, so please refer to the size carefully, you can measure it with a ruler before buying, so that you can better confirm whether it meets your needs. Finally we always try our best to let customers get the best experience and give customers the most authentic experience. We don't want to exaggerate the products, just hope that customers can understand, we are the professional sellers that sell gel seat cushion, you can trust us without hesitation.
