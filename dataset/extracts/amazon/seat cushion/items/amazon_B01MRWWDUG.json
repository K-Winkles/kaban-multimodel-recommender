I purchased it because we were driving across the country (27 hours 1 way), and the seats in my friends vehicle weren't very comfy for a larger person like myself. This cushion was a life saver! It was extremely comfortable and held its shape the entire trip. Since it's so thick, I was a little closer to the roof of the vehicle, but it wasn't that big of a deal after I got used to it.I used it on the way, while we were there for a week, and on the way back. It kept its shape and I was comfortable the entire time.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this item because it claimed to be a good fit for \"heavy people\".Instructions on bag that contains this compressed cushion say to shake the item vigorously for 5 minutes then put in a dryer with no heat and 2 clean tennis balls for 5 minutes.Don't have a dryer or tennis balls. Shook the item vigorously, albeit not for 5 minutes. Let stand for about an hour before using.Definite improvement over the hard bench I've been sitting on. Provided sufficient cushion and did not completely compress after sitting on it. Seems to be fairly well made and of reasonable quality.",

                "reviewText": "Finally an advertised 'Firm' cushion that lives up to its claim. Sadly, I sit for most of my work day and the prolonged sitting causes my lower legs to swell and my varicose veins to worsen. I've experimented with different chairs, cushions, wearing compression socks and the bottom line is, the human body was not indented to sit on one place for hours on end but I need to pay the bills so I have continued my search for the perfect solution. This is as close to perfect as I have found. It is larger than my chair but with its perfect amount of firm cushioning, I am making it work. I'm going to buy a second cushion just to have on hand.Side note, if they made a smaller version I would take it on every flight/vacation ... it's just that comfortable",

Going to test it on a long road trip soon. I\u2019m actually looking forward to the trip because of this pillow. I can highly recommend!",
