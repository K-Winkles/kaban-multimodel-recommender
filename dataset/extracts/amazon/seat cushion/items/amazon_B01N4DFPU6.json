                "reviewText": "I chose this one because it is narrow enough for my car seat + thick enough to elevate me, keeping my knees level with or below my hip line, for optimal lumbar spine comfort. It's tapered nicely so my legs aren't also elevated - just my 'posterior' is. Happy with how firm it WAS and that my lower back wasn't tense & achy after driving. Non-slip grip on the bottom holds it in place really well when I'm getting into/out of my car. The problem... I'm in my car only 2 or 3 days weekly and 2 hours on each day, yet in less than 2 months it's noticeably less firm and therefore thinner. I'm 5'9\" & 135 lbs so my weight or center of gravity isn't to blame. Don't want to have to buy another but will have to soon at this rate! However I won't buy this one again.Size, shape, design, fabric: 5 stars / longevity: 1 star",

It helps by putting extra cushion under my hamstrings and also elevating my hips. 10/10.",

                "reviewText": "OK, so I was a little hesitant to buy this product because of the reviewer who said something to the effect of \"perfect if you are an aesthetic and want to sit on a rock.\" That review seriously cracked me up. Yes, this thing is firm, but I like it. I\u02bbm not an aesthetic, but rode street bikes for many years with a thin seat. You sit on your sit bones and its fine. With this, its the same concept. I got this because my 2020 4runner seats are ridiculous- tilted so your knees are raised up and you are forced to sit in a seat the shape of a half-closed laptop. Even with the seat adjusted as level as possible, it was so uncomfortable. This cushion makes it do-able. This cushion is softer in the summer and harder in the winter until it warms up. It stays put and does not slide around, even when you scoot over it to step down out of the vehicle. I have used it for 5,000 miles and its still like new.",
