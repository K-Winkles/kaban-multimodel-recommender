                "reviewText": "I have hip pain stemming from sitting on hard surface wooden chairs too much. I bought this 18 x 16 size, as well as one of the gel type cushions from Ergo21. Both are kind of expensive and highly rated. After a month of using both on a daily basis, I have some observations.The Roho is a winner. It's thick enough, it's adjustable to whatever your weight happens to be, and it really does relieve the pressure points. As for the Ergo21, it just seems too thin, despite their claims that thin works great. Well, hmm, I beg to differ. I am left wondering, how can a single Ergo21 pad accommodate people ranging from 100 lbs or less up to 200lbs or more? Can't really unless it's adjustable, and these air cushions are adjustable. (For the record I weigh about 160.) On a hard surface chair for me at least, this Roho comes out a lot more comfortable, with the Ergo21 I still get that old butt ache coming through. The Ergo 21, it turns out is mostly a foam pad, with a very thin gel layer sandwiched sealed in vinyl on top of the foam. The gel pad is maybe 1/8\" thick at most. I mean if it were a 2\" or 3\" gel layer, I would be very interested to try that. But honestly, fail to see what that minimal gel layer is really supposed to do. You sit on it and it just squishes around and you are really just sitting on a piece of foam. A pretty expensive piece of foam.Back to this Roho. You basically pump it up til it's firm, sit on it, and let out some air until you sink in a bit. First time I let a bit too much air out and my butt was hitting wood. Had to pump it back up a bit. But that's pretty much what you want, just enough air so you don't sink all the way down. The Roho is slightly odd in that when you shift your weight the air slowly moves from one chamber to another. It's a bit like being on a slowly rocking boat. But you do quickly get used to that and forget about it.I find the 18x16 to be too big for my wooden dining chair and kitchen high back stool. 16x16 would be about right. I will probably buy another Roho in that size.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this for my 93 year old grandfather who lives and sleeps in his recliner. It was recommended by his PT to replace the stacks of pillows and pads he'd concocted.I got him to try it once and he sat on it for 2 days before cussing it and everyone around who suggested it. I sat it aside for a few days, attempted to try it again, same results. He hates it and says it's uncomfortable. It's also nearly impossible to keep inflated using the included pump, which constantly falls apart and doesn't make enough pressure to inflate when someone is on the pad, which should be expected considering its intended use! Since I spent $100 on a seat cushion, my 95yo (but far more mobile) grandmother attempted to put it in her seat on the couch. She hated it too.It was delivered on Dec 28, now it's only Jan 12 and I'm being told it's ineligible for return, despite being within the 30 day returns window.This has been a horrible experience and waste of money all around.",

I had been using a waffle cushion and the Roho Mosaic works much better albeit at a higher price. It is well thought out, for example with a carrying handle built into the cover and an accessible but non-interfering air valve. It comes with a small air pump and reasonably good instructions. I like the diagram on the side of the cover that shows how to orient the cushion before sitting on it.Con: You have to repump it some every few days, but that's not all that important as long as it is not too flat. Mine sprung a leak somewhere, I think in the air valve, after three weeks use making it totally unusable. I have no idea how that happened nor how often it happens. So, try to buy from somewhere that will replace it if you are unlucky.",
