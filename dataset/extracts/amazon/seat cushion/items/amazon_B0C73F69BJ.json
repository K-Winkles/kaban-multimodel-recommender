This involves a great deal of sitting chatting with your friends while also doing some paper crafting. Often these events are held in local churches, libraries, etc. and good chairs are not to be seen anywhere. I\u2019d like to have this cushion and I can take each time I go to one of these events so I can be comfortable without causing pain to my hip and knee. I like that this seems to stand up very well, plus size frame without flattening it. The cover is able to be washed easily with a nice zipper in the back of the cushion. I did spill some soda on one day when I was able to blocked off the soda as the material seem to repel water. I think everyone should have one of these is a truly makes a difference in your day.",

                "reviewText": "I really wasn't sure about where to start searching (brand wise) for a seat cushion. I work an office job and I sit in my chair for long periods of time throughout the day. I have been experiencing lower back pain after sitting for a while, so I knew something had to change. I thought I would try this before I invested in something significantly more expensive. This is actually an incredible cushion, its firm but squishy at the same time. I have a lot of back relief from this and I would say at least 80% of my back pain is gone now all due to the posture support this provides.",
