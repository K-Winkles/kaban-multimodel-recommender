Also, the memory foam gets ROCK HARD when it's really cold outside, so be aware of that. (I'm not judging this cushion based on that; that's just a memory foam thing.",

Before I got the chair cushion, I was having difficulty sitting at the desk for extended periods of time due to right hip joint pain cause by a minor accident. Now I can sit for about an hour or more and there is no pain! My wife also sits at the desk on the chair cushion for periods of time when I'm not home. This really speaks to the quality of the cushion. Also, we like that the cushion has a cover with a zipper so it can be removed and washed.",

                "reviewText": "When I first opened this item, I was hit with an extremely strong chemical smell, almost like paint. It started to give me a headache within a few minutes so I put it outside on my balcony for a few days in hopes that the smell would dissipate. This helped some, but after using it for a full day of work, my clothes started to smell like it! I would go into a completely different room and still smell it on me.The cushion does help with neck and back pain from extended sitting and working, but I was disappointed with the smell. It appears to be an issue with the cushion and not the cover, so it's not an easy fix to wash. I would recommend the manufacturer finds a way to let their product sit and offgass before sealing and sending to the consumer.",

Rather funny in the vacuum packed state.'Setting it free' from the vacuum it came to the full size in short order and has been comfortable to sit upon. I battle sciatica and piriformis syndrome and this has been helpful.They says it's portable - which is true, but not sure how you'd ever get it back into the compressed size save a vacuum sealer. The name is boldly embroidered on the front: UEUHFKTS. No idea what that means but I'm sure someone can come up with a funny sentence that covers it all. If so - post it please. We all gotta laugh more.",

                "reviewText": "I have a shop where I do occasional artist markets and vendor events, and sitting for 6 to 8 hours on questionable seating arrangements was killing my back. This cushion really helped preserve my back and improved my overall experience at the events. I will say when this arrived it had a very strong smell and I had to keep it outside for a few days until it dissipated. I love how soft the material is, and how thick and squishy the cushion itself is with the memory foam material. Definitely recommend if you need to sit for extended periods of time.",
