                "reviewText": "I finally found the cushion that provides the right lift and support that I'll need after my hip replacement surgery! It gives me excellent support without being hard as a rock! I've tried foam and gel cushions, but they have either been too hard or too squishy. With my 180 pound body on top of this cushion, it raises me about 3\" from the top of my chair while remaining both firm and comfortably soft. When I get up from the chair, the cushion immediately bounces back to the height that is stated on the website. The website shows the cushion with the curved side facing forward, but I find that it is more comfortable on my chair with the curved side in the back.",
