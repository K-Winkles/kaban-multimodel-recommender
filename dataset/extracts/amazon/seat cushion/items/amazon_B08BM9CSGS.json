                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Seat Cushion & Lumbar Support, and it has been a total game-changer for my daily comfort. The cool gel memory foam is a revelation \u2013 it adapts to my body's shape, providing an unmatched level of comfort during those long hours at my desk. I can genuinely feel the difference it makes, especially when compared to standard seat cushions.What I appreciate the most is the thoughtful design \u2013 the rectangular shape ensures comprehensive support for both my seat and lumbar region. Plus, the fact that it comes in a 2-pack is a fantastic bonus. I can now switch between my office chair and home seat without compromising on the comfort I've grown accustomed to. And let's not forget the sleek black color \u2013 it adds a touch of sophistication to my workspace.Durability is another highlight. The high-quality materials used in these cushions give me confidence that they'll stand the test of time. It's an investment in both comfort and longevity. Whether I'm in my office chair, car seat, or even on the couch, these cushions have become my go-to for promoting better posture and reducing discomfort. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Amazon Basics Seat Cushion & Lumbar Support, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable seating solution.",

Everyone in my family had to try it out and they all loved it too! Great price and value! So, SO comfortable, plus I don't slide off the chair with this cushion because it has tiny rubber spots on the backside! I've only had it a short time, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up, but it's a beautiful, comfortable thing now. Worth it!!!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I have since removed a star. The pillow has become squishier over time. While it provides support, it does not provide as much as I would like. Because a person's physical attributes and type of seat play a role in how this cushion works, I can't say anything bad about the pillow, but it's just not the pillow for me. Keep the squishiness in mind when purchasing this.One review said this product was \"squishy\" and I was worried I wouldn't get the required support for my back. Driving has been a difficult task since I had back surgery a decade ago, but I am happy to say this cushion has helped IMMENSLY with my back pain while driving.I am 6 ft, 200lbs and this cushion provides all the support I need to keep my back aligned properly.Thanks to this cushion I noticed an immediate and significant reduction in pain when driving.I would recommend this cushion to anyone that needs more support from their driver's seat.",
