                "reviewText": "As I write this review, I am sitting on this cushion. In fact, I've been working from home at my kitchen table and have been using it all day. Its 100% better than trying to sit on my thinly padded kitchen chairs all day. I have a degenerated disk in my back that I herniated last year, so I don't do well sitting for long periods of time. This cushion is a very good option for this price range. Is it as good as the brand name purple colored cushion? No. But it's also not $100-$150. If I could afford to have one of those on every chair I sit in, that would be great. But I'm quite pleased with this option. One thing that I especially like, that is different from the name brand ones that I have, is the cutout for your tailbone. With this, there's no pressure on my tailbone at all, which is great for the kind of back problems I have. The cushion is supportive enough that I don't crush it down to a flatness that would put a pressure on my tailbone. I am 160lbs, for reference. If you're looking for a good mid-priced option for this style of seat cushion, this is a great choice.",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple of older \"honeycomb\" 18x18\" square gel seat cushions. I used to drive long distances in a car, and needed the extra support to stay alert and comfortable. I notice this newer design HealthMate cushion has a different support structure with a different underlying and variable honeycomb pattern. I like the way this supports both my coccyx and upper thighs. It feels just right when put on a hard chair, cushioned office chair, or car seat.My only concern is comparing it to my larger cushions mentioned above. I prefer larger to provide more of an enveloping effect, and this Healthmate could be a bit larger back to front for my personal comfort. In a car seat, with bolsters, this is not an issue, but in a larger flatter position (like a wheelchair) some might have the same preference. It is a nice cushion, and I can speak from experience with similar materials of construction, used over a decade, that it should be durable.",

                "reviewText": "I was suffering tortures sitting for long periods of time when I had to work from home. My back and tailbone ached. I am too uncoordinated to use a standing desk, and standing for long periods of time was not an option for me anyway. This HealthMate IN9115 Comfy Gel Coccyx Seat Cushion has made all the difference in my pain. The seat feels so good. It elevates me in my chair about two inches which also makes working at my desk feel so much more natural. The cushion does not move around in my chair. There is a grip to the underside which I like. The seat is also breathable. It does not make me hot or uncomfortable.This was an easy fix for a very big problem. I love this cushion, and I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "What's very odd about this seat cushion is that it feels like it would be soft and cushy when handling but is actually very firm when sitting on it. I was hoping to \"sink in\" more like a soft cushion. The honeycomb design is perhaps a bit TOO effective at supporting weight. Or... maybe not at all? Maybe it's completely flattening so that's why it feels firm? I'm not sure, but either way it's not as soft as I would like. It feels like sitting on hard rubber.That said, it's still a decent quality cushion and does have a gap to take any pressure off your tailbone. Someone who doesn't mind a firm cushion may like it for this reason.It's also quite affordable, seems durable, will conform to the shape of your seat, breathes very well and has a convenient carry handle to take with you when you travel. While it's not quite what I was looking for, I still think it's a decent enough cushion.",
