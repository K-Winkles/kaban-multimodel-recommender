I've tried 4 brands to help relieve my painful sciatica, and although they were all okay, this one has been the best by far -- firm enough but not too hard and with a comfortable front edge that doesn't bite into my legs. I've actually bought a second one so I don't have to keep moving it from room to room. I have one on my computer chair at the moment and it's so comfy, yet sturdy. My tailbone doesn't get sore at all any more when I'm sitting. The extra long cut-out helps a lot since I'm kind of \"squirmy\" when I sit. Yes, there will be a bit of that \"foam smell\" at first -- every single brand I've tried plus my mattress topper had it. Just unpackage it and stick it in a spare room for a few days before using. It's worth the wait to relieve your pain.",
