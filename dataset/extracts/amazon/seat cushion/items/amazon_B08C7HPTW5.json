I cannot sit on the bleachers without support & this was something I could easily pack into my suitcase to fly without being bulky or weighing the luggage down. This is super comfortable for those with back-pain, leg pain, sciatica, etc. It\u2019s light weight and easy to carry for elderly or weak people. The only thing that would make it better for me is if it had a seat back as either an option as well as the ability to purchase additional covers and colors to support your favorite teams! Worth the money!!!",

                "reviewText": "This cushion has been used for a week now. I work from home and my shifts are ten hours long four days in a row. I get a 30 min for lunch and three 15 min breaks. So I sit in one place for long periods of time. My lower back, tail bone and bottom always hurt. This cushion worked from day one. It doesn't get hot and it keeps all of me from hurting. I am impressed.",

                "reviewText": "i bought the smaller one 1 month ago. it had the purple silicon as pictured. i really like it, but it was smaller than i would have liked. so last week i ordered the larger one from this same company.i noticed right away it wasn't as soft and comfortable. i unzipped the cover and there is a different color of silicon. Blue, not purple. who cares what color it is, right? well... i used both hands at the same time and did a pinch test between the 2 cushions. the blue one is DEFINITELY not as soft. soooo...they changed their formula and didn't tell anyone. the cushion is just OK. i may keep it or may send it back and 'hope' i get one with the original formula. <sigh>",

I purchased this cushion hoping it would help. I just returned from an 8 hour long drive and am very happy to report that I had not one uncomfortable minute. I have my love of road trips back and can\u2019t wait for the next one.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cushion for my Mom who has a pin in her hip after a hip fracture repair. Riding in a vehicle for any length of time becomes uncomfortable and sometimes downright painful. With this cushion, discomfort/pain has been dramatically minimized. She can now endure the drive to/from our house with very little to no complaints. I\u2019ve bought her one to leave in our truck and also one that she can transfer from vehicle to vehicle when riding in other peoples cars. It really has made such a difference in her comfort level, so in that it was worth every penny I paid for it.",
