Sitting all day makes me crazy sore and \"locks\" my hips up. Before I got this, I had to go on walks every other hour or so. Now, I can sit and focus without feeling like the bottom half of my body is actively dying. It does not stay in place though, so I'm often standing up to adjust it, but I'd take that over not having this.I'm a plus size person and my butt fits just fine on this, it doesn't feel weird or too small for me.4 stars because it gets annoying to have to adjust the damn thing every 30 minutes to an hour, but again, is rather have it than not",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a topper to my office chair that could get uncomfortable after a bit. I didn't want anything thick and seeing these for some time now I decided to give it a chance. THe results were meh at best. Truthfully I ended up abandoning it and just going back to the normal seat without any added cushion. I found that I had circulation issues and other discomfort while using this that I never encountered prior to using it. I now use it on a chair I regularly sit in to eat meals from and it is great on the hardwood chair surface. Although I am rarely using it more than 20 minutes at a time in that capacity so as a long term solution in such a case, I can't attest to.",
