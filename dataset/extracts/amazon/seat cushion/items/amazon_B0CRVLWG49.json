I decided to try this donut to help alleviate the pain and take some of the pressure off sitting on my tailbone. I use this on my couch. Even though my couch is soft, I know I need a little more support. I've never actually used one of theses types of pillows, so I have nothing to compare it to but, it seems to do the trick. I don't feel like I'm compressing my tailbone, and it gives the break it needs. It definitely can be a problem if you have a bigger backside, as I don't think it would be ideal for heavier people. I myself am a little thick and fit on it ok, but I think I could definitely use a bigger cushion. I would not recommend if you are a heavier set person.The quality seems good. The cover is soft and has a grippy bottom so it stays in place. In the end, it serves the purpose intended.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this cushion, but I don't. It's just too small and not comfortable to sit on. Starting with the size, it's just very small compared to my other cushions. The dimensions are clearly stated in the listing, but I didn't realize how much of a problem this would be until I received it. Sitting on it feels like a balancing act. Possibly due to its size or shape, it also digs into my thighs and is uncomfortable to sit on in a chair. It's not just me, my 60-pound 9-year-old son also finds it uncomfortable to sit on. Ironically, it's quite comfortable to sit on the floor and can be very good for yoga or other floor activities. I understand the cutout in the back, but I don't know what the cutout in the front is for. There are some real positives about this cushion. It comes beautifully packaged, including the nicest retail box of any of the cushions I have purchased, excellent instructions, and a very nice message about the company, which is a small outfit out of Florida. It also has the nicest, softest cover of any of my pillows and a very nicely embroidered logo. It's very good-looking. It has a really grippy, non-slip bottom, and the memory foam is a nice balance of soft and firm. While this pillow has many positive attributes, the size and shape make it uncomfortable to use, so I can't recommend it. I give it 4 stars because it's very well made and may fit other people better. It's also very useful for floor activities, such as yoga. Also, the company reached out to me to resolve and issue and their communication and customer service are excellent.",

I\u2019ve been sitting on it over a week and feel relief.It doesn\u2019t slip on your chair because of the non-skid surface on the bottom.I\u2019ve been sitting on old flat pillows, and trying different things to give my lower back some relief for months. This is definitely better.It\u2019s firm yet squishy (memory foam). I\u2019ll be taking it with me on a trip this weekend when I\u2019ll be doing a lot of crafting and sitting.I don\u2019t currently have tailbone issues, but in the past I bruised my coccyx when I fell down some stairs. I can see that using this pillow would be helpful with tailbone (coccyx) pain because of the cutout area.I haven\u2019t added heat or ice to the two areas that are left open for that, but I\u2019m keeping it in mind if the occasion arises that heat or cold are needed.Outer cover zips off and is machine washable.",

                "reviewText": "I did not get this for its intended purpose. I\u2019m using this as a pillow for my head. I have a Meta Quest 3, and I like to watch movies on it. With the strap that comes with the Quest, it\u2019s easy enough to lay back because the strap is just cloth. However, for normal use, the strap isn\u2019t the best. I have several other straps available, which are far more comfortable, especially for extended use. However, they all involve cushions that go against the back of the head, and those cushions are attached to hard plastic, including a knob. That makes it so that it\u2019s not comfortable to lean back or lay back. I thought, maybe, a donut pillow might solve this issue as it would have a hole in the middle where the back of the headset could fit while my head rests against the cushion. Is it perfect? No. However, it is better than nothing. If I were using the cushion to sit on, I think I would be happy with it. It\u2019s a firm piece of memory foam with a removable cover, but it does have some squish. Best of all, it did not smell when I pulled it out of the packaging.",

I got another donut shaped pillow for my home office chair, and that helped me a lot, so I got this one for a second chair that I use often.This pillow is 15\" x 12\" x 4\" and it is perfect for my condition, because it provides enough support while sitting without letting my problem area touch the chair. The base of it is made up of a non-skid fabric and it has a zipper all around it that can be unzipped for the cover to come off for cleaning. Since this pillow is perfect for my condition, I give it a full five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I found the seat pillow to be a standard size, donut pillow, soft outer covering and a firm cushion for support. I like the instruction card as it gives suggestions such as a hot or cold pad in the center hole if needed. I like that you can zip the cover off and wash it if needed. As a personal preference, I did not like the 2 side indented sections as my hips seem to sway from one side to the other and I would either feel uncomfortable or come off of it. I have become accustom to a solid form seat pillow. There is nothing wrong with the pillow. I tried using it for a little support of my degenerative neck discs while laying down and it surprising gave me that firm support on my neck joints. I tired using it with my Oculus Quest 3 as a pillow to support my head with a contour strap and it helped for some easement to watch movies with some neck support while laying down too. It came nicely package with some good instructions on its uses. The price appears to be fair market value.",
