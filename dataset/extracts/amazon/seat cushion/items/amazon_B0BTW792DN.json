                "reviewText": "I always thought that this kind of cushion was for lower back pain from sitting at a computer, but it is so amazing for knee and hip pain!!!My knees are super messed up. The pain radiates up to my hip which makes it hard to sit comfortably. This cushion offers fantastic pain relief for me!!! It's great at my desk, but also at the dining room table and in the car. I thought that the seats in our car were very comfortable, but this offers a big step up in relief there too. Try it; you'll like it!!!I think I'll get one of these for my mother-in-law too, because she had a not very successful back surgery and it's hard for her to sit, especially on a hard surface. She tried my cushion and was surprised at how much pain relief it gave her. I'm sure anyone in your life with pain in their lower half would appreciate this cushion as a gift. They just don't know how much they need it because they haven't tried it yet!!I would say this cushion sits nicely in the balance between firm support and soft cushion. Too soft and it wouldn't give pain relief. Too hard and your rear end might object. I like the size too. Our dining room table is an antique and the the chairs are quite narrow. It fits just fine, but I think it would accommodate a larger chair too. It's absolutely perfect in our tiny commuter car, but great in our big SUV too. The surface on top seems well made and so does the bottom of the cushion. It doesn't slide around on our hard dining room chair. I think it will hold up for quite a while.I can't see any flaws and the price is competitive. I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "My mother has a recliner that she loves but it\u2019s gotten hard and uncomfortable over the years. This cushion has made it possible for her to sit in it for long periods again! It\u2019s thick and soft with good support and a quality cover. The bottom has non-slip grippy \u2018dots\u2019 and the cover unzips for washing. The cushion is molded for comfort and even includes a gap for tailbone relief for people who have issues with their tailbones. Adding to its ergonomics is a slight forward tilt to keep the spine aligned. It\u2019s comfortable on her recliner and would be luxurious for office chairs and might even work on a wheelchair in a pinch. (I\u2019m pretty sure wheelchair cushions are slightly larger, but it varies). My mother loves this cushion so I recommend it highly for people who need a bit more cushion where they\u2019re sitting!",

I have an auto immune bone disease and am generally uncomfortable. This cushion has hills and valleys in all the right areas. The only thing I don't love is that the texture has little holes in it like a jersey material. Anything and everything gets stuck in them if you just look at it wrong. I ended up putting a pillow case over it, which I don't love for the look of it. I'd be super stoked if they busted out different covers to buy for it.",
