                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a 1,700 roundtrip road trip. We have a Ram Promaster that we converted into a camper. Our seats are tall because we put in a swivel device. The seats are not very comfortable and my husband and I both decided we needed to do something to save our butts on our long road trip. I really like the feel of this cushion. It does add a little more height to our already high seats than I would like, but if we had a regular type of seat, I don't think it would be that noticeable. We both felt the ride was much better because of this cushion. I didn't have the leg pain that I normally have on long trips. It is has a strap that locks it into place. My husband didn't use that, but I did. It could easily be used to a camping chair when we are sitting outside. I am happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have lower back pain from an auto accident but I need to work so I looked at various cushions as I was having problems sitting at work.This cushion would be perfect if it was thicker on the narrow end. I realize it is more geared towards car use than office chair. I do use it facing either way at work.I prefer it the direction it is meant to be used in but I slide forward and have to use the footrest under my desk. Otherwise the density of the thick end is perfect for my back. It is firm but just the right firmness for me.I like the clip on the back of the cushion. I keep it clipped to my office chair so housekeeping doesn't drop it when they come in at night although it is pretty skidproof.It would be nice if the elastic was a little longer because I usually have to pull it forward another 2\" so I'm not sliding forward.",

I have 5 ruptured discs in my lower back and find it very hard to be comfortable driving for very long with the way bucket seats are designed. This was my 4th and I'm very glad to say final try as this is PERFECT!!",
