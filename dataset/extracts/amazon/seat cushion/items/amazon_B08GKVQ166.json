Score!It fits across the YUDA Triangle Bamboo Bath Seat For Elderly and Adults almost perfectly, but I need to note that I am not elderly and I have danced (in dorky cultural ways- nothing marketable, lol) my whole life, so I will feasibly NOT meet the hard tile floor if this cushion ever slips because I lean too far in one direction. I don\u2019t know if the elderly would need to secure it!!It hasn\u2019t slipped me backwards yet (my one danger direction!), which means the silicone hexagons provide a better grip than I\u2019d expected: yay!The pain relief is beyond compare. I never comprehended or imagined what my body -could- feel if the pain evaporated. I have inborn mobility issues corrected in infancy in exchange for lifelong chronic pain because the method was new and Modern Medicine didn\u2019t know what would happen as the body matured. I\u2019m obviously a bit defensive about it when it comes to \u201cSo why IS an attractive, youthful, slip of a thing like you using geriatric accessories?\u201d :)If your mom still enshrines the metal bar that was on your feet in the 1970s or early 1980s, and wants you to STFU about pain because it means you\u2019re questioning this miracle, I Highly Advocate This Silicone Cushion!After 2 showers with it, I swiftly ordered a 2nd one for the car!! That was last night.I will try to provide the link to the Shower Seat For Hip Young People I use this cushion with.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FDBNDYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1",

I sort of knew gel was what I should have gone with from the start (memory foam - may be great for a bed, but for desk chair comfort it was useless). This item may not impress at first - it feels flimsy in hand but perfect once your weight is on it/across it. One warning - it's small (which I wanted) but if you're a larger person you may find it too small. I'm 165lb and it's a perfect fit (my desk chair is small so I didn't want some 21\" cushion - smaller is good for use in your car as well).Exactly the size and thickness I wanted - thrilled it's large enough and thick enough to get the job done - while keeping the small form factor I wanted. Previous purchase was 3\" thick foam and hurt my legs/circulation... 1\" gel is perfect. Slip cover is well made and attractive as well. 100% happy with this (half the price of the others as well \u2665)",

                "reviewText": "my mother at this point in life spends most of days in a hospital type bed. she thankfully can sit in her wheelchair but it was too uncomfortable for her to sit in for any length of time. that is before i got hold of this and another pad to use in her chair.now instead of being uncomfortable after thirty minutes she can sit without pain for as long as 4 hours. for most that might not seem like a big deal but for us with her situation it was a God send. thanks to these pads she is no longer confined to bed and is able to sit in her wheelchair on a daily basis.this made a world of difference and i highly recommend it be it for a back pad or for seating in a wheelchair.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I thought this was the purple Brand - but it is only the color purple. It isn't that it is bad or anything, but I don't know how it compares, except it was less expensive which is why I purchased it. It is genuinely helpful and makes a difference sitting in my desk chair at work! (slides somewhat but I also move somewhat) I am ultimately glad I have it and really don't have anything bad to say except maybe trying calling it Not-Purple Purple... I don't know, just saying that if it was not so intentionally similar to the band Purple and I bought it knowing this - my review here might be short and sweet, only.",
