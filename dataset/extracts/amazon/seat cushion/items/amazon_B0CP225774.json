It's very spongy but firm enough you will not find a hard spot, or one that is cold in winter or hot in summer. Now, I know you probably got by with a piece of foam to sit on. This is much better than that. A piece of foam doesn't give you much cushion. This is ample cushion. Unlike foam, it weighs a lot more so you're going to be hoofing the cushion and a cooler and whatnot so be mindful of that weight. Overall, this is a really nice rump saver and worth the coin.",
