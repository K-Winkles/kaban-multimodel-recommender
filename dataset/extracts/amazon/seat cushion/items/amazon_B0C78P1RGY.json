                "reviewText": "I received this cushion about 30 days ago and wanted to test it out for a bit before reviewing it, and while it hasn't completely transformed my life, it has made a noticeable difference in my daily comfort. Here's my take:I've been dealing with occasional lower back pain and spasms, and this cushion does offer a degree of relief. It's not a miracle worker but I didn't expect it to be. The ergonomic design and memory foam provide a comfortable seating experience, especially during long hours at the desk.Relieving coccyx discomfort intrigued me since I'm pretty sore after multiple hours at the desk, and I can say that the cushion does contribute to reducing discomfort in this area It's not a total solution, but the added support does make a noticeable difference.One of the features I appreciate is the non-slip bottom. It stays securely in place on my office chair, and I don't find myself constantly readjusting it. This feature adds to the overall convenience of use.So far, the cushion has held up well. The build quality seems durable, and I haven't noticed any significant wear and tear despite daily use.Overall, I like this cushion and will continue to use it. While it may not be a perfect fit for everyone, it's a practical solution for those seeking moderate support during extended periods of sitting.",

It makes sitting in your office chair way better! I would definitely recommend this one over the other cushions that have barely any form to them.",

                "reviewText": "I have had lower back issues for several years. Not bad enough to really want to \"do something\" about it, but a nuisance nonetheless. I have known, especially through work from home the last few years that I need to improve my posture at my desk; it just comes down to doing something about it. This pillow is an attempt in that direction.Thoughts:~The pillow is firm. This is good for posture, but it does take some getting used to. Candidly, it is tougher to slouch. Do I like that? I should.... but...~I definitely sit up and type better when sitting on the pillow.~When I first sit down, my rear does not match exactly to the contours of the pillow. I guess that is to be expected, but it wears in over a few minutes. I do think the gap in the middle helps with this.~I don't really have any dislikes, other than I know I need to use this, but it is not what I am \"used to\". I am used to slouching, and that is not good for me.Overall - I recommend this product if you are committed to helping back posture when sitting on the job.",

Once I straighten up, it is much better.I like the thickness of this cushion. I had gotten a \"bamboo\" cushion and that went flat very quickly (I think my cat liked it more than I did.) This I can sit on and it gives me some cushion and support. It does take a little fiddling to decide which way is more comfortable, bit hole toward the back or front. I have the big hole toward the back, that works for me.",

I've tried various cushioned foam and I have them in all my office chairs, whether at home or in the office. This particular seat cushion may take time for you to get used to as its shaped differently with a hole in the middle, but that in general will force you to sit in proper posture. It definitely alleviates a lot of my back and hip pain. It took me a month before leaving a review as I wanted to see how it is after a month of use, still good as new. The foam is firm and sturdy and the cover can be easily removed and pop in the washer. A little bit on the expensive side, but totally a game changer and highly recommended.",
