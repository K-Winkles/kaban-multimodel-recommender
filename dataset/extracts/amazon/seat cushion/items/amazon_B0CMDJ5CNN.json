The honeycombs collapse when you sit on the cushion, but of course they don't collapse straight down. They lean to one side, which makes her lean to that side a bit, and she says the sensation of sitting on the honeycomb is \"unsettling.\" I tried it out on a regular chair, and I see what she's talking about. I didn't dislike it as much as she did, but I also didn't sit on it as long. Mom said it would be a good base pad with a soft, and more conventional pillow-type pad on top of it so you don't feel the honeycomb. 3.5/5 for us",

The design is particularly good at staying ventilated and cool unlike memory foam I\u2019ve tried before. The silicone mesh stays firm enough to support you while sitting, but has enough play to provide a comfortable experience for prolonged sitting. The mesh sits inside a zipper closing bag, with gripping material on the bottom. It feels high quality and is much cheaper than paying for a name brand, similar color solution. Highly recommended!",

Maybe I'm oversensitive, but I could feel the gel cutouts of the cushion when sitting for very long.It worked much better for me when I placed it under another cushion that has a softer flat surface. The two together were quite comfortable.Maybe you will find this to be useful and not even notice the bumpy surface!",

                "reviewText": "I got this gel seat cushion for my 16 year old son. He uses it in his desk chair, in the car on long journeys, and even when go to a football stadium on the bleachers. He has a very thin, bony frame and needs some extra cushion and this gel seat cushion gives him that. He says it is very comfortable and amazingly doesn\u2019t sink in when sitting on it.The washable cover is very nice to have to keep the cushion clean and protected. It has grippers on the bottom and a good zipper.",
