This cushion is designed with strategic shaping and some resilient softness that helps correct the chair seat's tendency to turn the thighs inward. The cushion also has a notch to take pressure off the tailbone. The cushion is not perfect but it is an improvement and my pain after prolonged sitting is less than before.",

I have a plate and screws in my lower leg that cause nerve pain when I sit on hard benches with no back. While this is way too deep and I am petite, I put the back along the back edge of my bleacher (not hanging over behind me) and the front flaps just easily bent down, comfy under my knees. It is wider than some marked bleacher seats, but was not a problem where I went. It stayed put, too. Not only did my leg do great for the first time and the longest time, but my back and my rump were fine too! My posture was better. I'm short so it raised me to other's heights. And it has a great handle. Other people were complaining about painful aches from the LONG day sitting, while I was comfy. It's not helpful for my desk chair (my individual needs), but it's GREAT for bleachers, its intended use. My grandma-body was just fine next day too: the key positive result! Worth every penny for me!!! (Just be aware of arena seat width restrictions.)",

                "reviewText": "I fractured my tail bone in a fall about 1 1/2 years ago. I tried \"donut\" cushions and other homemade ideas, but was still miserable. This Bliss Trends Seat Cushion has enabled me to sit without pain! It is very comfortable. I did have to try it in different positions from back and front to find My perfect placement. It is holding its shape and is made of quality materials. I can't emphasize enough how much I love this cushion!",

                "reviewText": "Tough to shop online for items because you can't touch or try out the product. This seemed like it checked all the boxes. The foam is very soft. On a hard chair it compresses to almost no padding. Probably ok on a firm sofa for a little more support. The size fits a mature woman. That's a good thing. And the covering is soft. I would compare it to a car wash sponge.",
