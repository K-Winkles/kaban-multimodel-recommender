                "reviewText": "I have used this cushion in my office chair at home because my chair doesn't have much cushion or give. The cushion definitely helps with some of the problems I was experiencing with discomfort in certain areas. However it is not the best, and could be designed better.The pros--My butt doesn't get too hot as this thing has decent airflow. The cover is breathable and the grid allows for breathing.-It does help with cushioning a little.-It has held up for the past year and looks and functions like newThe cons-I weigh 200lbs and its to thin to provide the support I really need. For shorter usages its fine, but after 8 hours in the chair, there are some hot spots.-It slides around on my seat. It has little grip beads in the material but they don't stop it from moving, so I have to adjust it several times a day to keep it in place.- It's too narrow for my body. another inch or two would be betterI will continue to use it for a few more months, but if I were to do it over again, I would spend a bit more and get a thicker, higher quality cushion.",

The size is good and the comfort is excellent, watched a double header and the cushion did not fail. The cushion is a gel that is very comfortable that comes with a cover and a carrying case. The case is ok it\u2019s just a piece of plastic but the cover seems durable and has raised dots to help prevent the cushion from sliding. I would recommend this product without hesitation.",
