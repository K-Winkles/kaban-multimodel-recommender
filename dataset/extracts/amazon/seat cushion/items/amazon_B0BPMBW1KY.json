                "reviewText": "I've been using this cushion for 3 months in my office chair at home. Sometimes I'm working for hours before standing up to walk around and this cushion saves my butt and back. The thickness is just right and doesn't squash down flat when I'm on it. It bounces back quick when I get up. The little grippies on the bottom really keep it from scooting around when I'm moving. I think people underestimate how important a comfy chair is when you work at a desk or in front of a computer all day. This is definitely worth the price and now I want another one for my chair at my work office.It's the right size for me, but I think someone with a larger behind might find it a little on the small side. Looks bigger in the pictures though.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this cushion for a few days and I have to say it seems to deliver on its promises. The cushion is firm without being stiff & soft without being flimsy. It definitely adds a layer of comfort if you spend a lot of time at your desk, as I do. The price point seems very reasonable too.My biggest issue with this product is that I wish it were about 25% larger. As you can see in the picture I've uploaded, the cushion is smaller then is represented in the for-sale posting and doesn't fully cover the entire area of a standard desk chair. That is not a huge deal, but because the cushion is smaller, it does tend to shift around when you readjust yourself on your chair. That all could be corrected with a larger surface area. Of course, that would raise the price too. As for me, I'd rather pay a bit more and get exactly what I want. Without that complaint, I'd have absolutely given this product a 5-star review.Bottom line - It seems to help with \"chair fatigue\".UPDATE - After using this product for a few months, I changed my rating from 4 stars to 3. Why? Because, as I mentioned in my original review, the surface area of this cushion is just not large enough. When I first started using it, I didn't think that would be much of an issue, but since then I've found it to be kind of a pain to have to constantly readjust every time I get up or sit down. All of this could be rectified by just increasing the surface size to standard office chair dimensions. Oh well...",

                "reviewText": "I have a cheap office chair that I got for my home office and I really struggle with sitting in it as even though it has memory foam in the seat, it is not comfortable and feels hard in spite of that cushion. I also have issues with the slope of the front where my knees hit making my knees lower than my hips which causes stress and pain for me. This cushion will not correct for that but, what it does do, is provides relief in so many other areas that it makes this issue less noticeable and not as unpleasant. I work from home and spend 7 hours in my chair, it really does need to be comfortable. This cushion came nicely packed, (picture #5) folded over and took it\u2019s shape quickly after unpacking. The first pic shows the top view, 2nd is the bottom of the cushion, 3rd is the side view for depth - it is about 4\u201d deep I believe, and the 4th pic shows where the zipper for the cover is and you can see the construction of it al is very well done. I have used this for a week now and while I can\u2019t speak to how ergonomic it is, I do feel it is doing what it should to make my seated position be more in line with ergonomic concerns. And, as for pain relief, I am not there yet but, I do feel improvement daily so, I feel that will come in time. As far as comfort goes, it is100% comfortable and I really am glad I got it if only for that alone. I felt it the instant I sat down and it definitely did provide a good start to my day. The pain may still come but, it is less and less with each day. I hope the memory foam will withstand the daily use and last for a long time as I look forward to many comfy days ahead!",
