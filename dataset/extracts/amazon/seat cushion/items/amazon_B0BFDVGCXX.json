                "reviewText": "My recumbent bike seat was killing my coccyx (tailbone). The pain was so bad after 15 minutes of a workout that I could barely stand and then it took a few seconds before the pain subsided enough to walk. I looked at replacement seats, but so many people had issues with them fitting that I decided to try a regular cushion. I purchased this one because it has the grippy dots on the bottom. I figured that if it slipped around, I would secure it, but it holds in place very well. I followed the recommendations in the reviews to get the extra large and it is perfect! The extra padding (see bump in my photo) really helps cushion the tailbone. I had no pain after a 30-minute workout this morning and plan to continue to extend my workout time now that my poor rear can tolerate it. The cushion hangs over a little in the front but it causes no problem while working out. Money well spent!",
