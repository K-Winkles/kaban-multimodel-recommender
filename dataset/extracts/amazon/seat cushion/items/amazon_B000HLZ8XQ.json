I use it in long car drives, bring it inside and use it on my couch for movies, even take it to the movie theatre. We recently did an international trip and I used it on the airplane also. After years of use, it's lost a bit of support but still does the job more than adequately. I hope they don't stop making this because I want to buy it again after mine eventually wears out. The quality, shape, comfort and the price are perfect for this cushion.",
