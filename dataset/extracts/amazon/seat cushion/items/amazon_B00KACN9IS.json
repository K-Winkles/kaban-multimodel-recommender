                "reviewText": "It's a decent pad but it's cut small and if you do not have it perfectly seated in a chair of equivalent size it becomes very unstable to sit on and you will wobble. The corners also become crushed in shape rather quickly so it's fine for short term item but I don't recommend it for somebody that needs it regularly. The zebra print cover is more like a square of flannel sheet with a little bit of netting and a fitted back so the bottom is in exposed foam it will be difficult to clean because it's definitely not water resistant.",
