                "reviewText": "So Thrilled with my New Cushion, I let Alison Know what it feels like to have RELIEF after so many years of pain and trying every cushion out there.Hi Alison,You are so right \"Comfort Hunter\" I have two online stores and I realize sitting is not the best way too work, but your right our Mill and Industrial, Physically Exhausting Jobs are over and forced to do other things for a Profession has led to a lot of sitting people. For years I have literally tried all sorts of cushions and I had bought chair after chair after chair. Consistent Back Aches have been a norm. I even sent away for a Cushion for one of my Chairs recently that had a 5 year warranty and it did come, and I'm not good at tools, so I asked my husband for help putting it together and he actually thought I was trying to bully him to put it together. I asked only twice and explained my reasons, physical pain, but he many times interprets that as Crocodile Tears. He even threatened to throw the chair out the door. He was either tv watching or playing games on the computer trying to veg out and relax. He is an OTR Truck Driver having only 34 hours home a week and work is not what he wants to do. I even cried at one point and attempted to do it myself to no avail. So back on the computer and checking out Amazon again for what seemed like an impossible search for comfort. When I saw your Cushion. It was in the car delivered, but my hope had been deflated a long time ago. So later that evening when things quieted down; I went out to get the cushion. What a Big box I thought, but I knew it was the cushion. Amazon said it was delivered. Opening up the box, it did look like the one that one reviewer had left an awesome review when he and her husband bought one for Mom. The guy in the video who also tried the cushion said, he loves his Mom. His wife certainly went right along to get her Mother In law the cushion to make her life more comfortable. All of this blessed my heart and I loved the way the woman demonstrated the cushion. The top is really so so soft and she unzipped it too and showed the memory foam, a nice thick piece. I do feel the limit on weigh should be about 250, maybe you do need to make cushions for those that are about 500. There are no doubt are people out there that are tall and may in fact weigh that much. In any case. It was perfect for me. I loved it ! I wanted you to know so that you could tell your boss how happy I was. I really truly searched and searched and spent so so much, way too much for the comfort I got from your cushion and such a reasonable price. It was that Wonderful Loving Family with the Mother In law that helped me to give it one more try and I'm so happy I did. Thank you. I'm going to leave you 5 stars for sure. I'm totally 5 Star Plus Thrilled about my Wonderful Desk Jockey Cushion and may get one for my back as well for the car or to take along with me wherever I go l Keep up the Great Work and Thank you so so much for this cushion. Sincerely Denise McleanI guess that pretty much said all that was needed to be said. I am so Glad I gave it another try.",

                "reviewText": "I will begin by stating that I am 6'9\" and 530 pounds. This is by far the most supportive and overall size that I have found. All their claims are correct. At first use it seemed hard but after a couple days softened up a bit increasing its comfort. Excellent craftsmanship and visually appealing. Being my size and weight I flatten it almost completely and find it slightly narrow, however do believe, for a slightly lighter (500 or less) person, it is a 5 star product. I place it under my couch cushion and am much more comfortable now. Also constant back ache has now gone and my bottom feels much more accommodated. I would definitely recomend this to other big guys/gals out there. The up to 500 pound rating and wider width is what attracted me to this unique product. The world just doesn't build for us giant folks and I appreciate that Desk Jockey has. Thank you. I feel the only way to improve on this product would be to either make it an inch or so thicker and a couple inches wider. Or a couple inches wider and put a heavy duty air bladder in it. The air bladder, I would say, would make it the most ULTIMATE cushion out there including price. I am satisfied!",

I am older with osteo and RA, it has been difficult to find that just right cushion that supports and gives enough to be comfortable, nothing gets rid of all the pain but this helps a lot. This pad fits the bill for me. It is thick and I am short so does not work as well in my office chair until I find a foot rest to put my feet higher. I do love the cushion overall and highly recommend it to my friends and family.",

I was very pleased with the quality and comfort, so I decided to order this larger one with one of the back support cushions. The back support is great, but this seat cushion is nowhere near the quality of my previously purchase one. Cover is color is totally different than what is pictured (not the issue), but the supposed \u201cmemory foam\u201d is no better than a piece of foam rubber! Was expecting some firmness, but this cushion is very squishy, and basically adds little to nothing in terms of cushioning and support. Will probably swap this for the cushion I have at home because was really needing that little \u201cextra\u201d for my office chair!",

Even more, I\u2019ve had it for a couple months now and it\u2019s held its shape wonderfully, not breaking down at all. 10/10 Would absolutely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "TL/DR: This cushion will go flat under your weight after a very short time.I purchased this seat cushion for my home office chair. I work from home two days a week and needed something to cushion the dining room style chair I use for my desk. After reading many reviews for this and other seat cushions, I thought this would work for me. As a heavier person, finding seat cushion that can support my weight is challenging and this cushion claims to support up to 300 lbs (I am under this weight limit). In the first few days, I thought it would work okay but as time as gone on, I find that the cushion goes completely flat within minutes of sitting on it. No support, no cushion. Just flat squish under my butt and legs. I will continue to use it until I can find a better option because it's better than nothing. Very disappointed.",

So I shopped around and did my research and finally bought this cushion. It is very big and very thick. When I sit on this cushion, my butt is in heaven. No more pain. I am a big guy so this cushion handles my 315 lbs very well. And when I get up, it always springs back up to its normal thickness. Well worth the money.",

When I use ithe riser for her, she starts screaming. Recently, after a fall, she finds it difficult to get up from the chair. She weighs around 67kg (10.5 stone).Therefore, I decided to try this cushion in order to raise the seat cushion height. I will report again, in due course, regarding the cushion's effectiveness.",
