            "Comfy & Ergonomic Support: Our powder-free high-resilience cushion foam is a leading filling that has excellent resilience and durability and can offer even support. Therefore, the D-shaped chair cushion, 2\" in thickness, can provide a comfy surface and ergonomic support, protecting your tailbone, reducing pressure, and relaxing your muscles. With it, no more hard chair surfaces, and no more constantly adjusting your sitting posture to relieve the stiffness of sitting long.",
            "Non-slip Bottom & Ties: The chair cushion has a bottom with plenty of non-slip dots and also two 23.6'' ties to keep it absolutely in place during use. In the beginning, the bottom has an adequate non-slip effect and for aesthetic purposes, you can remove the ties (removable). But as is known to all, the anti-slip particles may gradually age after long use, affecting the non-slip effect. Then you can add the ties and fasten the cushion to your chairs.",
            "Easy to Clean & Wash Tips: With a removable zippered cover, our cushion is very easy to clean. Unzip and remove the cover and wash it by hand or with a washing machine (wash cold). Then just tumble dry with no heat or air dry. Please note that do not iron or bleach the cushion, and do not wash the foam insert.",
            "Durable & Attention to Details: Made of 250g/m\u00b2 polyester fabric (a bit thicker than common fabric), the cushion cover is breathable, skin-friendly, and very durable. All the fabric edges have overlocking stitch design and won't get loose/broken easily, making the cushion more durable. In addition, the horizontal zipper of the cover, wrapped in the cover, won't scratch the furniture surface.",
            "Suitable for Most Chairs: The horseshoe-shaped cushion measures 17\"Lx16\"Wx2\"H, suitable for most chairs such as dining, kitchen chairs, folding, rocking chairs, and bar stools. Besides, the simple solid-color style makes the cushion a perfect fit for furniture of various styles. Please measure your furniture before ordering, and after receiving and unpacking the package, please allow about 48 hours for the cushion foam to rebound to its normal shape."

Nice and comfy.Added note: they come with strings to tie them to the chairs but we don\u2019t use them as they stay put on their own.",

I\u2019ve bought several sets of cushions for my Amish cherrywood chairs over the years, but none of them fit exactly right until I found these! They\u2019re wider at the front than the back. They look great too, the burgundy is a very rich red. I also like that the covers are washable. I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase!",

I wish they were a bit thicker, but that's just my personal preference. Would recommend.",
