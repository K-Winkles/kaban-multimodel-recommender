                "reviewText": "Want a gel cushion that is big enough for a real seat (not those tiny ones), that is incredibly comfy & has a true non-slip cover? This is the one. After two other previous purchases which most definitely did NOT stay in place but slipped all Over & the cushiness was nut there, I ordered this one & boy am I happy now! Order this one & save money by trial & error.",
