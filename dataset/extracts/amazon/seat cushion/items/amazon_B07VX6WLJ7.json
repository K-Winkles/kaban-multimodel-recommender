I am 4'11.5\" and before the cushion, I felt as if I was sitting in a hole and could barely see over the hood of the car. I also use the cushion at my dinette table in my RV. I am now at the perfect height to be able to comfortably use my computer and eat my meals! It appears to be a good quality cushion.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for a thick, very soft cushion--this is a good cushion.If you are looking for a height boost, not so much.This cushion is 5 inches thick... until you put weight on it. As near as I can tell it then compresses to about 2 inches. The cushion is very soft.I'm a 6'3\" 190 pound male, and after hip surgery I wanted a cushion to bring chairs up to a more comfortable height. 5 inches would be about right. I've been using this cushion in combination with a 2 inch dense memory foam cushion that I already had, and together they do provide about the right amount of lift...But really this is not a booster cushion. It's just a squishy chair cushion.As far as the price/value ratio. It seems reasonably well made, but it just a fabric shell over some sort of fiberfill stuffing. The price seems high to me for what it is, when other similarly priced cushions use more expensive memory foamI don't hate it, I don't love it.It might be exactly what you are looking for, but be aware it doesn't give as much lift as it implies.",

If you're hoping for an actual boost, keep looking. Gave it three stars only because it arrived quickly and the material was nice.",
