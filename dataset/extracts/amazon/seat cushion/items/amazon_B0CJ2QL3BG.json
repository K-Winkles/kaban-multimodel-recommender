The pad also tended to walk out from under you as you shift around in your seat. It did look nice but I didn't try it on my face the overall size was fine as it cover most of a regular chair seat. This was near the lower price point for cushions so maybe to improve I will need to pay more. The initial quality seems good but lacks a comfortable design pattern. If this pad was to be inserted in a larger cushion and restrained it might add to the comfort of the seat so long as there is a different pad between his one and my back side. I will send it back and continue to look for an extended use seat cushion.",

                "reviewText": "It's a cheap way to add a bit of cushion to your chair. The problem is it will not stay in place whatsoever. The material lends itself to slide all over the place and has zero grip at all. The moment you get up, it will slide right off the chair with ease. The material should have some sort of friction barrier on the bottom to make sure it stays put.Comfort is fine. The \"cushion\" is easily removed from the sleeve , so the sleeve can be washed.",

                "reviewText": "Trimmed easily with a pair of scissors to fit the shower chair and, at us$18, less expensive by half than similar products I saw on Amazon so I was willing to try cutting it at all. Water will run through it and that\u2019s a really good thing. We put wash rags to be between it and the bum cause it feels a little weird to sit directly on and since the cover it came with obviously isn\u2019t going to work for this. We\u2019ve only had it for a couple showers but so far so good!",
