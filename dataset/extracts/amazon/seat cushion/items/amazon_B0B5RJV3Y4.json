                "reviewText": "Ok so i got this cushion becuz i sit all day, i try to kneel on the floor, sit in a kneeling chair and stand at my desk throughout the day so that i am not sitting all day. If i sit all day my sacrum is killing me by the time i get home. about 15yrs ago i had surgery for a herniation between my sacrum and L5. I've been fortunate becuz only since last yr my back has been causing me alot of problems, probably becuz of being locked down and staying home more due to covid. Fast forward....This cushions works, it is firm, it keeps it's shape, it is comfortable, it absolutely helps, i can sit on it all day and my back doesn't hurt.When i first sat in the cushion the first day it made my lower back hurt, however i very quickly realized that IF that happens to add sum lumbar support. I hav a lumbar pillow so once i put that in place i was VERY comfy. I now see why two pillows are shown when u order. i think the lumbar support is key here, when using the cushion.I do understand that the cushion was NOT causing harm to my back, becuz i was sitting differently other back muslces needed to be engaged more. Im happy that using that extra lumbar support worked becuz it really does feel so much better. Feels like normal, when you were young and didn't hav any back problems.i am very happy with this purchase, it is exactly what i needed and the best part is my back doesn't bother me from sitting all day.P.S.1. Play with the adjusting of the cushion, just sit it in at first,2. then get up and push it all the way back in the chair, then sit down in it, see how u like that.3. Then get up and move it forward in the chair and see how you like that. (note if the cushion is more forward in the chair the lumbar support is most useful for that perfect form of sitting up straight and tall in the chair.4. most importantly is to play around with the positioning so you find the most comfortable position for you.I was so happy with this purchase i had to write a review!Thanks for reading and have an awesome day!!!",

                "reviewText": "I got this a few years ago and tried to use it with an office chair that had no more cushion left in the seat. Unfortunately, the seat was much larger than this cushion, so it never felt right. Very uncomfortable. So I put it aside as \"one of those\" purchases.Years later, that old POS office chair is long gone. New chair is smaller, and this cushion fits perfectly! I've not been using it for about 4 months straight, every day, and it's really made a difference, especially on my tail bone and sciatica. The memory foam used is very firm, as it should be. Very happy now.",
