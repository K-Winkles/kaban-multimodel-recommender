(As opposed to traveling for the first 5 or 6 feet before I can straighten up.)I know if my mom was still alive, She would have loved this cushion, I highly recommend this.It has a zip off cover. And so far, there's no dirt on it from even being transported back-and-forth. I think is well worth the price... And it came in 2 days!",

You see, even my motorized wheelchair in the home which has a nice comfy seat, after about 30 mins the pain was horrendous but then sciatica would jump in.Since I started using this I can sit for I don't know how long in my wheelchair. It's longer than before and my trips to Dr appts are so much better. I never mentioned how much better my butt feels! Wow! I'm not constantly repositioning myself.
