                "reviewText": "I do ridesharing on the side and or days off. My car has heated seats, I could feel the wiring and was hurting my arse. I bought a different brand and it worked for a bought a year, before buying a pillow and putting it on top of the seat cushion out of desperation.I searched for something better than what I had and came across this brand. I thought wow who better to know what a person needs than someone who's already is a seated postion/wheel chair. I bought both the memory foam and cooling gel cushions to test out which would be better for my needs. My friend was over when the gel on arrived and he was telling me how he's been in extreme discomfort by his tailbone doing ride share. So I let him have the gel one and I used the memory foam one when it arrived 2days later.I bought it in the middle of summet and the memory foam is just that, no support and made me hotter sitting it in on hot days. Tried it for about 10days and had to return it. I asked my friend how his was and he was raving. His butt don't hurt anymore, he can driving wo having to adjust and or worry about the pain, and thanked me for it. I returned my memory foam for the gel and couldn't be happier. Been using it for at least 3-4 months and it been a pleasure. I don't dread getting into my car anymore. I like that cool feeling when I first sit, that it doesn't heat up from driving for hours. Love that it's thick, I'm small 5'2, so it may not work for a tall person in their car (mini van yes) 250lbs, and it holds it shape and durability! This a a must have for anyone who drives for a living, car/van/truck, DEFINITELY worth its price so you can concentrate on driving and know you won't feel all twisted up/stiff when you get out of your vehicle.",

                "reviewText": "I had been having severe pain in my bottom just taking short trips in the car. I can only assume it is because of my back issues. I have tried other seat cushions with little to no success in lessening this pain, and some increasing the pain. But I gave this one a shot because it is made specifically for people who have pain from sitting for long periods of time. I thought if it could help them, surely it could help me, and it did! I have absolutely no more pain in the patootie or legs, for that matter, while riding in the car.On the down side because if the boost, the lumbar support of the seat is no longer in the right place, so I do get back stiffness and pain in the back when getting up from sitting too long, but that would be without the cushion too. So I will happily take the pain free car ride.",

                "reviewText": "My aging father had so many clinic and hospital visits while battling cancer. For much of it, he was able to walk to and from the car, and walk into his appointments. However, once in a chair or a wheelchair, he became so uncomfortable it was akin to torture for him to sit. He battled cancer for over 4 years and had lost almost all of his padding (fat) during chemo. This pad was the perfect solution for his comfort during all of those follow up appts and treatments.",

I decided to test it out and thought it was a bit high also but the comfort level was really outstanding! The support felt great and there was no pressure on my tailbone, which was the main reason for purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This cushion is very supportive and comfortable to sit on. However, with it's thickness and very sloped front edge, I find I tend to sit very high in my chair and I slide forward and down as I'm moving around and doing things sitting on this cushion. I have to occasionally adjust my position back in the chair as I have the sensation of falling forward and sliding off. It's significant enough that I'm thinking of getting a non-curved front cushion like I previously had. Maybe it's my short stature that contributes to this.",
