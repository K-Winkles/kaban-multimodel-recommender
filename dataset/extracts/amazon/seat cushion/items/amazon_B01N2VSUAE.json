                "reviewText": "I purchased this because I wanted something that was portable, convenient, and of course-- alleviated back pain. The cushion itself works just fine and is supportive. My criticism comes for the value for the money, as I paid over $30 for this item, I would say the investment in cost seemed to be more for the elaborate design than overall functionality of the item as the fabric is beginning to pill and the functionality of the item is basic. I did not have a giant blue handprint design on my cushion, simply a raised, sewn in design as pictured, however the \"look\" of the item was not why I purchased this. The back has a simple clasp and is slightly stretchy, but overall I feel I over-paid for this even if it works, estimating the cost to be more a greater value if there were more functional elements to the cushion.Overall point: Works fine ( not a miracle worker), supports but could probably find a comparable one for less money, Average quality of outer material, Decent-quality cushion comfort. Wouldn't re-purchase.",

                "reviewText": "When this arrived rolled up like a swiss roll I thought 'If this can be rolled that tight its not going to provide much support' & I wasn't wrong - very thin cheap foam cushion being sold as supportive. If I could give this ZEROSTARS I would & for the price it's an absolute rip off!! As a wheelchair user I'm fed up with this cheap unsupportive foam rubbish being sold as something comfortable to sit on or providing any kind of support or relief from seating discomfort!!",
