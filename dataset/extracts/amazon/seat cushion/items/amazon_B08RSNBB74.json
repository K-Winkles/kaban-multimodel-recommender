                "reviewText": "The 2022 Toyota Highlander Limited has the most uncomfortable driver's seat I have ever sat in. Unfortunately, with the current car supply problems I wasn't able to sit in one before ordering. Even though it has an 8-way adjustable seat, I can't find a position that is comfortable for my low back. It's hard under my sits bones, it doesn't tilt up high enough in front to support long legs, it's shorter front to back than either of my Honda vehicles, and the adjustable lumbar support hits at the bottom of my rib cage instead of supporting my lower back.I ordered the Lofty Aim Premium Car Seat Cushion and it improves all of the above issues. It's soft under the sits bones, it provides additional length front to back, it provides additional height in front to support my thighs, and it raises me up so that the seat lumbar support is lower on my back. It's very well made; the material on the bottom keeps it from sliding around, the foam cushioning is soft yet supportive, and the dimensions are larger than others I considered on Amazon. This cushion has greatly improved the comfort of the seat, and has eliminated the back pain I experienced without it.",

I have another one (black color) in my pickup truck...been using it for years. Same memory foam/style...no real problemsThe GOOD- very good blend of support and size, thin but supportive- latches front and back and doesn't bind- using the factory heated seats does not affect getting your butt warmThe NOT so good- using the factory seats ventilation is comprised- could use a little thicker memory foam section where your tailbone sits (spinal support)CONCLUSION- solid buy, good quality, does the job, need a little more butt-bone thickness, needs more color options",

The straps and the texture on the bottom side keep the seat cushion in place when entering and exiting the vehicle. I agree with others who've said that it could be a bit thicker. I think the front pocket is handy but could be a little deeper. Good value overall but giving it 4 stars for these reasons.",
