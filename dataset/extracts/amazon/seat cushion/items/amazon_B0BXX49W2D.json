                "reviewText": "I suffer from tailbone pain whenever I sit for a while so I have, and have had, a lot of seat cushions. I think this is the nicest one to date. It came rolled up in a canvas bag and was rather difficult to get out. Once out, it was two parts - the cushion itself, with a carrying strap, and the cover, also with a carrying strap. The carrying strap on the cushion was not removable, so you have to be careful when putting the cover on that the strap is tucked into the hole in the back or it could be uncomfortable and/or damage the cover.The cover fits perfectly (a bit difficult to get on and zipper up; it helps to have an extra set of hands to assist) and it is nice to have a carrying strap. The cover can, of course, be removed and washed.The cushion itself is not terribly soft (which works for me but some people might like it softer). The first thing I noticed when I sat on it was that it did, indeed, feel cool/cold. I didn't know the \"cooling gel core\" in the title was anything more than just a selling tactic, but it is indeed surprisingly cool. I think this will be a nice feature when the hotter summer months come around.",

I just started a job where I spend the majority of my time sitting in an office chair and by the afternoon the end of my tail bone starts to ache. This does the trick to take that ache away. I do have to get used to raising my bottom to get over the top of the cushion since it makes the seat so much higher, but after that it is super comfy. It came vacuumed sealed in a bag and once opened popped right up. It has it's own cover, that fits just right. The cushion and the cover each have a belt that ties around the chair. I am very pleased with this purchase.",
