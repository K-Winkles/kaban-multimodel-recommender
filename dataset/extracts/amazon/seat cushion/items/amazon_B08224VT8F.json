Pushed the straps down the back of the seat as directed, and it's held firmly in place. I was worried the shaping and stitching would be uncomfortable or too thick, especially sitting on it in shorts or a thin dress. But turned out to be really comfortable - not too thick to bother the back of my legs but thick enough to provide the cushioning I need since I have arthritis and hip problems.I've had this since April 2023, and even with regular use it's held up and still looks as good as new. It's a good product, does the job, and as an added bonus my seat doesn't get hot in summer.",

                "reviewText": "This cushion is perfect. Fits my set perfectly, and it's not to thick. I got it for the driver seat of my 2010 Ford Flex. My car is in fabulous condition for a 13 year old car. I never have anyone in my car, but the driver's seat I'm starting to feel it on the butt. It also has the straps that go through to the back, and the round things hold it in place perfectly.",

It is thin so I was worried it wouldn't be comfortable enough to help my cars cheap seats but it did and didn't raise me up much. Also unlike some it doesn't start off firm then go flat, yeah it squishes out a little but not much. It will shift a little but not bad, totally worth it. I also put a cover over my seat and this pad which adds a little more wear protection, stability, and comfort.",

Yeah it still has its cushiony feeling but i dont know how much longer itll last. Maybe im too fat for it, i dont know . Plus side is that it doesnt slide around much on the seat itself so thats a plus for sure, because my old one always moved around and needed to be readjusted constantly.",
