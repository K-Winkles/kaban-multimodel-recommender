                "reviewText": "Just got it so I'll update after a few weeks of use.First impression is that its well made. High density foam pillow feels like it will return to original shape and not form depressions and lose support as a cheap pillow or cushion will over time. The grey cover is not at all unattractive especially in a business environment such as an office, which is where I use mine. It looks like it belongs and not something I brought from my dining room chair at home. The foam core takes some getting used to...specifically how to place your derriere on the cushion. At first I sat on/over the center hole cutout. After pulling my underwear back in place several times I scooted back towards the rear of the pillow and discovered I had been sitting on the cushion incorrectly. You straddle the center hole and make sure your tailbone is over the coccyx cutout. The hole appears to create space for the side supports to expand into so don't sit in the center hole. Once I squirmed around and discovered how to sit on it, this cushion seems really comfortable and encourages good posture. So far...so good.Update 10/28/13This cushion has made a difference. I'm able to sit much more comfortably given my lower back muscle spasms. I've upgraded to 5 stars.Update 12/5/13I ordered another one of these cushion rings but didn't pay any mind to the seller since the prices were identical. The second cushion came from a different seller and arrived with a sub-standard cover compared to the first one. The cover on the first one (September 27, 2013 review) was well made, had a good fit and a zippered back to remove the cover. The second one arrived with a thin, cheap cover with a sloppy fit and no zipper...just a slot where the cushion fit through. The finish on either side of the opening is nothing more than stitches running the length of the opening and the seam created is already coming apart right out of the box without any use of the cushion. I bought the first cushion with the nice cover from Medical Department Stores. The second with the cheap flimsy cover came from International Coffee and Books (probably should have paid more attention to that one...!). I've returned the item and reordered from Medical Department Stores and emailed the seller to make sure I receive the zippered cover. You should do the same.",

                "reviewText": "This was a lifesaver! After losing 150 lbs, I lost my butt, and as a result, my tailbone is pretty exposed. Sitting for any length of time gets it sore, and we had a 3000 mile roadtrip coming up. I got a lot of recommendations, and the Kabooti was commonly recommended. I purchased it, and set out on the trip.The cutout shape saved my coccyx. Before, I couldn't drive more than half an hour before I got sore. With this, I had a couple of 12 hour driving days that were just fine.There were only 2 minor drawbacks. First, this was almost too tall for me to use in my car (Jeep Liberty). I have a pretty long torso, and when I sit on this, the top of my head sticks into the sunroof area. But fortunately I could still see ok through the windshield, so it was only a minor annoyance. The other negative was that after a few hours, my butt cheeks would start to get sore. The foam is kind of solid, which is a good thing overall, but after a long time, there was some muscle fatigue that set in. I wonder if a different pillow with a different top (like gel or something) would help alleviate this. However, this only happened on the really long driving days, and I'm sure I would've felt fatigue no matter what I was sitting on.If you are prone to tailbone pain, I highly recommend this pillow. I'll continue to use it a lot in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I use a recumbent bicycle to help manage low back pain. Unfortunately, all the gyms in my area have bikes that aggravate my hemorrhoids, so I'd had to quit using the bike. A regular pillow or cushion didn't help, as they didn't negate the center ridge that all seats have. The Kabooti has allowed me to resume using a recumbent bike. (It obviously wouldn't work with a regular bike because of the narrow seat. Seats on recumbent bikes are wide enough to support the entire cushion.) I'd also noticed before that my feet were often numb when I finished a bike session; this problem appears to have gone away with the Kabooti. I don't know if that's because of taking the pressure off my tailbone, or because of the slanted seat front taking pressure off my thighs.There is a small mechanical difference when using the Kabooti in this way. The seat being higher requires me to adjust the seat position a little backwards to avoid my knees hitting the console, but that hasn't been a problem for me.I originally purchased the XL Kabooti with an extended seat. I'm overweight (5'11\", 275 pounds), so I thought I'd need a wide seat -- not so. I returned the XL, and replaced it with the regular Kabooti, which fits just fine.The Kabooti also works just fine in a chair. :)Some people have complained about the hardness of the cushion. It is firm, but not uncomfortable for me. The indentation, though, seems a little narrow (it's the same width on both cushion sizes). If I don't sit exactly in the center of the cushion, and miss the indentation, then it is hard for the problem area I have.",

On balance, it is the most versatile effective product of a dozen or so I have purchased over time, (many much more expensive,) or DIY, improvised for \"sitting pain\" issues. I have purchased 3 of these. One for home, one for the car, and one for loan to my father-in-law. The cover washes well and fairly easy to put back on. The cushion is firm, lightweight and does not appear to break down. The only problem I have is a tendency to forget it, leaving it in restaurants. But the trip back to retrieve it is well worth it!!!",
