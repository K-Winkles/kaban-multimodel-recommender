I'd say it's worth the price but the pain relief and value will take time to validate. As of right now, since it wasn't quite what I expected, I rated it 4 stars.",

What makes it harder to sit just the right way is it slides a little each time you get up. So even if it's positioned perfectly, it will not be when you get up and sit back down. I really do not recommend.",
