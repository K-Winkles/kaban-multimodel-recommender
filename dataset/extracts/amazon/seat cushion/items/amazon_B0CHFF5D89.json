The doctor did not believe that it was something that needed to be treated and recommended using a seat cushion. After reading a lot of reviews, I bought this one because I liked the shape of it. Right out of the box, the cushion was too firm to sit on. But after a few days, the cushion softened up and became very comfortable to sit on. It definitely helps alleviate the pain and makes sitting in front of the computer much more bearable. Money well spent.",
