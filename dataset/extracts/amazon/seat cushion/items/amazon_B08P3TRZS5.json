You can fully crush it with your hands, so needless to say under full body weight, its not doing much. I am thinking about grabbing one from the 'more expensive' brand to see if those are any different. But this isn't great.One or the other will get returned. I guess we'll find out later. But for now I don't know if all of these mats are the same, or if there is some difference from one brand to the next. What I do know is that this one didn't perform as expected.***UPDATE***I bought the 'name brand' version that costs ~$100ish after being disappointed with this one. I have them both here as I type. The name brand one is vastly superior. It is thicker, denser and more comfortable. SO if you're on the fence and can afford the other one, just save yourself some headache and do that. While it may not be 3x better as the price is 3x more.. It is at least twice as good. I'll be returning this one and keeping the 'name brand' one.",

I myself have been having problems getting up after sitting down to work for extended periods. The SelectSoma Large Gel Seat Cushion really came to the rescue. After trying it out for a full week of desk work, I can say that pain from standing up from the seated position is almost gone. I need only do a little stretch and I'm good to go. No pain. I also noticed that the pain I used to have from sciatica is also gone. I will be buying 2 more for my uncle and aunt and another one to use in my car as well. What a wonderful product! I give it 97/100 points! If it could be increased in size by 10 cm more, the score would be 100! Thank you SelectSoma Large Gel Seat Cushion!",
