My friend suggested a pillow would provide a better alignment. So, browsing my daily shopping site (Amazon), i found the Pamasana cushion and, without hesitation, placed an order for it. WOW! It raises the derriere for comfort alignment and there is no pain when cruising, accelerating or braking. It also provides that extra seat height needed to ease sitting and standing from chairs. Such a perfect, economical solution for anyone experiencing similar lower-limb discomfort.",

The seller sent a proactive email asking how I like the product, and to contact them if I had any problems or questions. While I've never had any comparable seat cushion, I've nothing to compare it to. That said, it appears to be a good size to fit on an office chair and it has a nice thickness. One side has an anti-slip, grip surface to it. So far it's comfortable, and the price seemed reasonable. The choices on Amazon can be mind-boggling, as you know if you're reading this. I appreciate that the seller is conscientious about the product they're selling. That feels rare in today's world.",

I'm sway back and sitting for long periods of time produced stiffness and made it hard to get up from my desk chair. This was works. It does not slip around on the chair and does adapt to shifting position.",

                "reviewText": "I received the cushion in a timely fashion. The first item had a broken zipper but the company sent me a new product to replace it the next day. Excellent customer service. The cushion is quite thick, so it does add some height along with support. It\u2019s also firm and doesn\u2019t feel like it will flatten out too quickly and become useless. The bottom of the cushion cover has little rubber circles so that the cushion doesn\u2019t slip off the chair when you sit down. I got the cushion because I\u2019m five feet and just missing a few inches to be sitting in an ergonomically correct fashion with a 28 inch heigh desk. This cushion fit my standard size office chair and also gave me those extra inches to be able to work correctly. The cushion could also work well for driving. Just a yell out to my fellow on-the-small-side peeps. Would recommend.",

In addition, this cushion seems very well made. The zipper for the cover is hidden and worked well and the handle is most welcome if you want to use the seat everywhere you go. However, it is very firm (hard), very thick and did not position my butt/lower back in a proper place for my concern which is scoliosis and sitting on this for even a short time, made my ache worse. I can see how this would be ideal in some cases but I apparently need softer, supportive cushion.",
