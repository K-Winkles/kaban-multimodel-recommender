I can reach the pedals and everything just fine, but I hate feeling like I can't see over the dash and hood of the truck. I wish these came standard in all trucks. This cushion is thick, but it isn't hard or anything. It's supportive and soft, great to sit on, but it also keeps me sitting up high enough that I can see a lot better over the dash. Since the truck is critical to keeping our business going, it's really important that I be able to drive it in instances that my husband can't.I feel a lot safer with this cushion. It is a bit wide, so I'm not sure how well it will fit into buckets seats on smaller sized cars. It doesn't 'sit' down into my Mini Cooper's seat, but it fits well enough in the seat of my SUV and the Ram, with its bench seat. It's helpful for my son to use as well, and he's about 5'10\". He can see fine, but he feels safer and better about moving the truck around our driveway to hook to the trailer while sitting on this.For the added feeling of safety that I get, this is great. Plus it's supportive and soft at the same time. Can't beat the feel of it verses the stock seats in the Dodge.",

It really increases my comfort while sitting and I think also improves my posture. The memory foam cushion happily molds itself to my personal shape, and I greatly prefer it to the underlying chair cushion. It is tall though, so the chair height had to be lowered to keep an appropriate height for sitting. The cushion fabric seems like a good choice, breathable on the top where one sits but with more rubbery feel on the bottom to help keep it in place on the seat without sliding. And its larger size is a big plus.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't a users of the chair cushions - then I tried one while WFH. My desk chair was not the best and I needed something while I spent 8 hours a day sitting in it. A co-worker suggested a tailbone cushion. I've been a convert ever since that first one. After several years of consistent use, it was time to replace that beloved cushion. Enter Zikee! This one is great! I love that the cover zips off and can be washed. The tapered front edge throws my legs into a natural slope. Don't let the 3\" height throw you off. Even the tiniest of hineys on it compress down to a very comfy size. The cover is well made and doesn't slide around on my mesh chair. I'm using it right now and my backside isn't touching the mesh chair anywhere. It does it's job comfortably and reliably. I've already told my co-workers and sisters about it. Great cushion Zikee and I'd give this to anyone that I feel is close enough to get a butt cushion.",

                "reviewText": "I tried to like this thick, heavy cushion, but it has two major drawbacks which affect its rating. Maybe three if you include the $30 cost of entry, too.If you read the description, it's supposed to be good for airplane and car use, i.e. travel. So where's the little loop handle that practically all of these \"portable\" cushions have for carrying? None here. Not very handy, I'd say.I ordered it for a permanent job on my office chair, so the travel handle isn't an issue. But I don't always wear long pants around the house, and its cover fabric is coarse and rough on skin. I've never encountered any pillow-like device with this kind of scratchy material. A real bummer.Thick enough that I lowered my chair for use. Not the feature set I expect for $30.",

                "reviewText": "I have an office chair that isn't so nice to my bottom anymore, this cushion fixed that. I'm a pretty big guy, and I can spend a lot of time in my office chair. This cushion is making it much more comfortable for me. It appears to have pretty good stitching in the seams, but only time will tell if it can handle my weight for an extended period of time. But right now, I'm very pleased with this cushion.",
