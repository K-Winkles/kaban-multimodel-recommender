This cushion was just enough to get my thighs off the edges and soften those pressure points, while being thin enough to maintain the original ergonomics. It also makes unconventional positions much more comfortable.I don't think I'd recommend this for a wooden dining chair, but for my use case it is ideal. It may also be suitable for an older desk chair where the existing cushion is worn out.This is my first impression but I will update my review if it changes with long term use.",

                "reviewText": "Greetings Reviewer,I shopped and compared several foam and gel seat cushions made by many companies. My goal was to reduce the hardness of my old office chair where the chair cushion gave way and is ;hard' to sit on for any length of time. I chose a gel seat as it is softer than memory foam, foam retains body heat where as gel offers air cooling vents/cones, and it supports the tail bone much better for longer use in comfort. Plus the pricing was reasonable for this product to help extend the life of my office chair.",

                "reviewText": "I worked very hard, and have lost 90 pounds. Who knew that besides having nothung ti wear, my biggest problem would be a boney butt! However, there it is. Tried more wedge shaped pads, but felt I was slidding off the chair. So after more looking I found this and it seems to be about right. The gel pad schmooches in the right places so I am secure in the chair and there are no other pressure sites. There is a small cut out for the tailbone, but it isnt quite as deep as I had hoped iit would be. It is much better than anything else I have tried. If I need more, I would definately repurchase. I like that it doesnt have a have a high lift. I can still sit in my recliner, my feet touch the floor, zand it diesnt cut circulation at my thighs. Goid purchase, and would reccommend.",
