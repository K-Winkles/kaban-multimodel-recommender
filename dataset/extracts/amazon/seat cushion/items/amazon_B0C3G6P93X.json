The 20\" length from seat back to seat front is perfect but I would like if the width was about 24\" side to side to better fit in the seat. On a PU leather chair the cushion tends to drift from side to side and the extra 4\" width would tend to cut down on this drift. The gel is adaptive to the user but a bit thicker memory foam pad on top would cut down on feeling the gel cells underneath and would make it more comfortable. I've tried several different cushions and this one is, by far, the best.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this pillow. It is gynormous, comfy, and makes my office chair much nicer. It really helps relieve my tailbone, low back, and hip pain. It has a nice case with a handle and anti-slip sticky dots on the bottom. Inside it has a blue honeycomb gel pad with another smaller pad on top. I like it better without the extra pad (it\u2019s a little too stiff for me with both pads). It is a little too long for my office chair, but it is still comfy on the back of my legs. It is a little pricey, but for the pain relief it is worth every penny. Overall a great pillow. Would make a nice gift too!",

                "reviewText": "I was really looking forward to this Gel Pad that appeared to be great quality and comfort. The minute I sat on it, I was very disappointed. Usually, gel products allow a bit of sinking into the cushion and then you feel the support all around on your tailbone, lower back and glutes.This gel cushion makes you feel like you're sitting up high and there is no \"give\" or flexibility to relax into to provide relief for sore tailbones and sciatica pain. This will probably end up being another cushion for our cats to sleep on since returning things to Amazon can be a hassle.",
