                "reviewText": "the specs say this is 21\"long x 19wide. i wish. it is actually 19 long by 19.5 wide. i tried it once so i have not used it very much. it seems to still fit ok and it is comfortable. some people complain about the thickness but that is correct. i didnt want too thick myself. well see how the foam holds up. i do wish it was longer as stated bc my seat is longer in a 20 durango. it comes up a little short in the front so i could use the extra support under my knees. the width is good which will give you some extra bolstering. this is just about the biggest one sold here i can find compared to other brands and similar models. in fact most are wider than longer which is not how car seats are made, so measure yours. the only thing i see that is longer are the full coverage faux leather bottom covers that go over the sides. those seem to have better sizes thus tempting to try, but i dont think they have much padding and are more protective covers than pads. ill prob stick with mine bc im not seeing anything longer but wanted to write the review bc the description is wrong. please make longer at 20.5-21\"",

Adding the cushion was simple and the anchors were perfect to keep it in place. The chair stands quite tall, so we wanted a slim cushion to avoid excess height. This fit the bill. We did not expect it to add as much comfort as it does. By all accounts, it feels like a completely different chair with the cushion in place.",
