                "reviewText": "As someone who spends a significant amount of time sitting, whether it's driving while making deliveries or using the computer for business or personal purposes, I have tried several different options to alleviate discomfort and improve posture. Unfortunately, most of these options have been ineffective, making it an ongoing and almost impossible task to find a comfortable solution. I had been looking for an item that could serve multiple purposes in one and make sitting more comfortable, which led me to request this cushion that seemed like the best option.However, upon receiving the cushion, I was disappointed with the packaging as it came in a plastic bag that looked more like a vacuum-sealed steak you would find in your freezer than a cushion. Nonetheless, I cut open the bag and allowed the cushion to decompress as instructed in the included paperwork. Although it stated waiting 24 hours, I decided to wait for an additional 24 hours to ensure that it was completely decompressed and would be effective in the long run.Once I tried the cushion, I could feel the difference right away, even after sitting for an extended period. I then decided to test it while driving, and although it made the drive more comfortable, it made me sit higher up, causing my head to hit the roof of the car, which was uncomfortable and unpleasant. Although it increased comfort while driving, I was unable to drive for long using it.To further test the cushion's effectiveness, I used it on an old wooden chair with no cushion, and it made sitting on the chair much more comfortable. The only drawback was that it slid around, and it would have been helpful to have some sort of strap or velcro to keep it in place.Overall, I found the cushion to be well worth the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who spends long periods sitting. It comes with a handle that makes it easy to carry, a removable case to keep it clean, and the durability to stand up to a hard wooden surface without any additional support. However, if you plan on using it while driving, I would recommend testing it while parked to avoid any potential issues.",

He says it's more comfortable than just sitting on the wheel chair seat or a regular pillow. I sat on the cushion and I also thought it was comfy I would order one for me to put in a regular chair to sit on.",

                "reviewText": "Full disclosure: I've never been a big fan of this type of cushion. For some reason they make me sit in a way that makes things hurt more than before. I blame this on blue-collar genetics in a white-collar job to tell the truth. My ancestors hoisted heavy things for a living and walked to work up hill both ways. I probably just wasn't meant to sit in a chair all day.With that out of the way, this particular cushion is better than others I've tried.It came in a small package and, once opened, had to be left out for 24 hours to fully unpack itself.My office chair isn't \"terrible\" but sometimes I just need to change sitting positions. That's where this cushion comes in for me. I'll set it up with the gap facing forward most of the time. After a few hours, I usually go back to just the bare chair. Not because the cushion is \"bad\" but because the chair feels better to me after spending some time on the cushion.I weigh a \"tad\" under 200 lbs and I feel like it's \"mostly\" compressed (though not quite completely - and still comfortable). If you weigh much more, you may not get much \"cush\" from this cushion.",

                "reviewText": "11 years ago I went to Cherokee NC and I went tubing and lost my tube and had to walk bare foot through a slippery rock bed. While doing so, I slipped and landed directly on my tailbone which split it. I was told by my doctors that there was nothing to do, basically to sit on a pillow until it healed. Since then, it basically sticks out like an actual little stubby tail (literally), especially when sitting in a normal chair. To this day, it hurts more than words can explain while sitting in a normal chair. That being said, I\u2019ve been a cushion freak since. I saw this show up and wanted to test it out since I am a Vine reviewer. I expected more to be honest. It\u2019s not awful; it makes sitting in a normal chair more comfortable. It\u2019s just not as thick as I expected, for one, and it\u2019s a little too soft. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t want a solid block of stiff foam. But I wanted something a little more firm that way it didn\u2019t fully flatten out while sitting on it. I\u2019m only 192 pounds and for my height, that\u2019s healthy. So, if you\u2019re near my weight or more, it\u2019ll do the trick, but there are better options out there.",

If your tailbone gives you trouble, I'd recommend trying out this pillow. It's a comfortable thickness, it's not too thick or too firm like some of the others I've tried that made me feel like I was sitting in a booster seat. I might get another one for the car!",
