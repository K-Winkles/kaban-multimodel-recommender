Tried it out and was so happy I ordered 2 more for the loveseat and another 3 for the sofa. I now have a comfortable seating area that we can enjoy. Love the way the set looks and feels now. Didn't want to have to replace the whole set if I could avoid that, and this did the trick! If you want to buy this to use as I did, just note that you may have to play a bit with the positioning of the cushion under your existing one to get the best look and feel. Very happy with this purchase!",

The size is a little too small for the seat of the chair, but not terribly so. It has a nice cover over the waffle pattern and does provide a fair amount of relief. The one thing that I do not like is that the depth of the waffled pattern is a bit high, and the sides tend to fold over en masse. Not a deal breaker, though, and I am please with the purchase.",

It does have a bit of grip on the bottom. Sitting directly on the seat cover is a little uncomfortable material so I wrap it in a jersey cotton pashmina a few times to thicken it up a bit. Works great been sitting on it every day for 8 hours each no problem.",
