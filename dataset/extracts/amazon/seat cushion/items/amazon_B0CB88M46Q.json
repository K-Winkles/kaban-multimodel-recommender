It has gotten bad enough where I basically can't sit unless I have a lot of padding that is soft enough to compensate for the incorrectly distributed weight on my hips and pelvis, but still firm enough to offer support (pads that are too soft don't help me). This pads density and shape fits the bill! I've had plenty of seat pads over the years and this one has been by far the best. I carry it around with me from chair to chair as I can't sit for even a few minutes without it. I'd purchase more for every seat in the house but I'm hoping to correct the underlying problem instead.",

I have tried five different seat cushions, and this is the only one I can sit in. It is soft and squishy and supportive, and just right. All the others, even though they are memory foam, feel as hard as a rock. I like it so much, I\u2019m buying another one. I hope my second one is just like my first!My second arrived very timely. And yes, it\u2019s just as comfortable as the first. They are thick, too thick to use for the car. But now I have one at the kitchen table and one for my office desk.",

                "reviewText": "I have been spending more time at our kitchen table, my new office, but the chair is starting to feel very uncomfortable. After a few hours, the chair feels like there isn't any padding at all, so I needed to find a solution. Luckily, I found the WANTELL seat cushion for desk chairs. Based on my usage and review, I am giving the WANTELL seat cushion a 4-star rating.The WANTELL seat cushion has a non-slip bottom which worked well while getting on and off the chair. And the cushion provided a lot of cushion which eliminated my sore tailbone. The seat cushion is fairly thick, so make sure you have enough space between your chair and the bottom of the table. It was not an issue in my situation, but could be a problem for some desk/table heights.The seat cushion contour made a surprising difference. The contour ensured there was extra cushion where you need it. The WANTELL seat cushion is a simple solution for a not so simple problem. Don't let the simplicity of the cushion cause you to overlook the design benefits. I recommend the WANTELL seat cushion if you need added support to eliminate chair fatigue.",

                "reviewText": "I am in the process of doing my research on buying a new office chair, since I work from home and spend so much time a day sitting. It takes a lot to determine the right chair, so I decided to get this Desk Chair Cushion in the interim. The cushion is comfortable, but it would better if it was larger as it doesn't cover my entire seat. I do like the back side is coarse, so the cushion doesn't slide around in the chair. I have to position it just right for it to become comfortable. It's doing the job until I can get a new chair and then perhaps, I will find another use for it. I really don't have any pains to test it for pain relief, but it doesn't cause any. I felt it was a little pricey for a cushion, but it seems everything is high these days!",

I personally like this, but know it might be a problem for others. The bottom of it has a grippy texture so it doesn't slide around in my office chair. Really like this! I'm a heavier person so can vouch for it if you're also heavier since it can be tough to find a cushion that can handle extra weight.",
