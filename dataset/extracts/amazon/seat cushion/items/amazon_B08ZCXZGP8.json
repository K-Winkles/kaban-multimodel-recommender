I considered buying a cushion that is self-lifting but all the reviews say those cushions are hard and I felt they would not be comfortable to sit on for hours. Then I saw this gel cushion which has memory foam which would be softer for sitting, with a handle so I could take in the car - another plus as I am only 4\u201910\u201d and seat belts don\u2019t fit where they are supposed to across my chest.

It\u2019s gives about 2\u201d when I sit and I only weigh 100 lbs. the previous one hardly gave in at all, but was still comfortable. But it is an excellent product.",

                "reviewText": "Nice cushion seems even bigger than it really measures to be. It makes it hard to keep it on a chair that doesn't have arms. It will stick out over the edges many dining room chairs for example, and get knocked off when pets or people brush against it. It is very comfortable and really helps with low back pain. The only thing that might make it even better is if it had a tailbone cut out, but that's a different product. It helped my mother-in-law's back pain right away, and even raises her up in the chair a little bit, so she can reach better when we play cards. It makes a hard chair far more comfortable for longer periods.",

                "reviewText": "This cushion is excellent. I will be having hip replacement very soon. Sitting is the best position at this point. But a regular chair or even a recliner doesn't provide sufficient support and comfort. This cushion does. I tried several, but this one is the only one providing comfort. It seems very heavy and really thick (4 inches) and once you sit down it seems really high, but as soon as you sit on it you it feels as if you are melting, while it slowly encapsulating your buttocks and hip in soft but yet firm comfort. The cushion supports and relieves much of the pain. In addition, it cools while sitting on it. Excellent, highly recommended. Worth every penny.",
