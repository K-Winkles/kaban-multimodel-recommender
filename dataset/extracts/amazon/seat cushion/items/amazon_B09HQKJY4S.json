Theirs did not have a way to inflate it, so when it went flat I found this similar item on Amazon and ordered it. After a few weeks of use it also went flat because of a small puncture. I tried to patch it but it didn't hold. I then ordered 2 more so I would have a spare in case one developed a leak. He uses this pillow to relieve some of the soreness of sitting while he is undergoing wound care. He takes it everywhere including driving. I wish it was a little more durable, but it's inexpensive to replace, so that is a plus. I recommend this product for medical use and for comfort.",

Didn\u2019t even receive the upgraded pump. I got the cheap red one. Product worked great for a week or so of light use, then got a pin hole in a seam allowing it to deflate. Tried two of these with same results. Hard pass on this item.",

I personally highly recommend it.",
