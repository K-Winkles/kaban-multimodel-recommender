                "reviewText": "I'm a larger person. I bought an office chair that also accommodated larger people, however the seat compressed very quickly. My husband had a Purple mat like this, but it was much smaller. I liked the support it gave and decided to find a bigger one for myself. I love the size of this, and if you are on the lighter side, it's probably fine. The cushion just collapsed when sat on. Beyond that, the front would squish out and was uncomfortable below my legs. It's not a bad cushion, and the size is great, but for a larger person, I don't recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I immediately noticed the comfort this cushion added to my desk chair. The concern is that the cushion slipped as I shifted in the chair. When I rose from the chair, it would slide forward and often fall to the floor. I solved the sliding issue by purchasing stretch cords with hooks on the ends. I placed one vertically across the center of the cushion, then stretched it under the chair and hooked the ends to each other, then I did the same horizontally. I don't notice the cords when I'm sitting, and the cushion can no longer slide around.",
