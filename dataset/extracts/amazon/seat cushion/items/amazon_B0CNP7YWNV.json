It included a strap for attaching it to the wheelchair.It feels very nice, providing a lot of cushioning.There is a cutout for the tailbone, so that you aren't pressing on that part, which can cause your feet and legs to fall asleep.Suggestion: The manufacturer should consider providing a similar cutout at the front, for men.The only problem is it increases the height of the seat, but that was an easy fix -- I just had to remove the current cushion.This cushion is also a good option for office chairs.",
