Unfortunately, I had to return it because it does not provide any cooling/ air flow between my butt and the chair. It was comfortable to sit on though, being the perfect balance between stiff and soft. I would recommend giving this cushion a try for those that don\u2019t mind a more firm cushion to those gel cushions. But if you\u2019re looking for air flow, this will not do.Good:- Comfortable, not too firm or soft- Came in it\u2019s own bag- Good qualityBad:- No air flow- Mesh material can be uncomfortable to bare skin",
