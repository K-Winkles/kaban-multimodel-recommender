They have nice long chair ties and a non slip bottom to keep them in place. Extremely comfortable and the color is perfect. Will definitely be ordering additional cushions. I highly recommend purchasing these cushions.",

I ordered the brown color and it's not a dark brown nor a light brown, but in the middle brown that blends nicely with a natural wooden chair color. These were not cheap, but I would say worth the money.",

But the packaging is amazing!!!!! 6 cushions come vacuum packed so thin you can't believe they could spring out to 2 inches, but they do! The ties are well sown in and long enough to reach distant spindles, and the cushions are comfortable enough. 6 cushion option is great for a 6 chair dining set. I could use 2 more, though, for my 8 chairs, so I wish I could buy them individually.",

I selected these for our arrow back chairs because the color was the least offensive for our d\u00e9cor and because I thought they would meet our immediate needs. While they are not the exact shape of our chair seats, they do work. I love that they stay in place without the ties, and they are comfortable. The appearance isn\u2019t too bad either.They are well-made with no strings sticking out or seams about to split open. In fact, I believe them to be durable cushions. After two months of twice a day use, they have retained their original form.",
