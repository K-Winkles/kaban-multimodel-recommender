Be prepared to be noticeably raised up from your normal seating height. Also, the cushion is an odd shape and I had to look at the product page to know which was the front versus back. If you don't mind the thickness, it is a sturdy, well-made and comfortable cushion. I just found it too thick.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good seat cushion if you have back pain. I have had several surgery\u2019s on my back and neck. I went threw a few seat cushions . This one is a little on the big side and little odd shape from others I have used, but this one is the most supportive and comfortable . Just the right firmness where it helps your lower back and it\u2019s not to hard to be sitting on for hours. I use it to drive mostly. Since it\u2019s a little on the big side it\u2019s perfect for driving . Your not sinking down into the cushion or fidgeting around trying to get comfortable . I can honestly say I have notice when am walking I have less pain in my back and hip. Since I been using this cushion. (Bone taken out of hip) and it\u2019s only been a little over a week since the first time I used this cushion.The cushion made very well not cheap at all. The only thing I would like to have on this pillow is some type of handle or strap. It\u2019s a bit hard to carry for me . Little hands .So yes I like this cushion very much and highly recommend to anyone with lower back pain.",
