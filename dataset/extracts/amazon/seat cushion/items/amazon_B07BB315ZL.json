                "reviewText": "In retirement I spend a lot of time on my porch rocker watching to world go by. The Wally World traditional tufted seat cushion served for a few years until I found a large variety of memory foam coccyx sculpted cushions being offered. This item is simply the cat's meow.First, very competitive pricing. Second, a full 3\" tall providing ample cushion. Third, immediate relief and immediate improvement in posture just have a firm, sculpted throne upon which to settle my tailbone.Previous reviews have complained about the stiffness of the memory foam. It is a true memory foam, and why else buy one but to have firm support where needed? This comes with a zipper to remove the cover for washing, and my experience is cheap zippers will eventually disappoint, but not here! Clearly well made and durable. The pebbled bottom grip surface keeps the cushion where I place it in the rocker, I cannot \"scootch\" down to shift position - I have to stand up and adjust the placement. Where it stays where I put it. The traditional flat cushion would cover the entire surface of the rocker seat, and would uncomfortably press against the inside angle of my knees, cutting off circulation and making me shift position to relieve the tingle. Not this Plixio! It fully supports my bottom, and extends only to mid-thigh underneath me, so my knees are in the open air and not impeded in the slightest.Finally ... the cards and literature included show this is a small, friend run business in Tampa for the past ten years. The owner included a card with a direct (814) area code number to contact him directly for any product problem or question. It was a small delight to receive a photo of the entire staff wishing me well.GREAT find, which is harder to do on today's Amazon than it ought to be.",

                "reviewText": "I sit a lot. My day job is computer programmer, and when I'm done with that, I write novels.This cushion is thick and cushy, as advertised, and the cutout does a good job eliminating tailbone pain.However, it's not perfect, and I don't think any of the competitors will be, either. In short, it's just not the right size. It seems to be designed for the smallest chair you're likely to put it on and not an average office chair. As I'm sitting on it right now, if I position it enough it's under my all the way at the back, then it's 3 or 4 inches too short towards the front. And it's about 2 inches too narrow.Furthermore, it doesn't tail off in a sort of waterfall design the way my chair does, so the support of my legs just stops suddenly rather than curving down. The end result is uncomfortable pressure partway down my legs. If I slouch around or move the cushion on the chair, it only moves where that point hits.For me the end result is:-A cure for tailbone pain-But otherwise not as comfortable as my (pretty decent) office chair is without the cushionIt might be a perfect fit for a smallish to average-sized woman or maybe even up to an average-sized man. But I'm 6-2 and broad.If they could fix these things, they'd get additional star for each:-Correct size-\"curve off\" at the legs to match the curve of the chair I'm sitting onI don't think any of the competitors will be any better. I have to decide if the no-tailbone-pain is worth the added discomfort otherwise.",
