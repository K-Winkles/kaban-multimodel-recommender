I didn't even realize that I was uncomfortable in my seat before until I sat on the cushion. I felt less pressure on my back and I was able to sit upright but not rigidly. It was soooo comfortable that I even forgot I was sitting on it after 2 to 4 hours of driving-and I was in the passenger seat.Very soft, there will be height difference- a minor boost, but definitely a boost regardless. The instructions are clear and not difficult at all to follow. My knees were relaxed because of the accommodation and I just implore you to get it. Just get it. Don't hesitate and don't think twice. If you made it this far in the review, then this is a sign to GET COMFORT.",

It strikes the perfect balance between softness and support, alleviating discomfort during prolonged sitting sessions. The pricing is reasonable, making it an affordable solution. With a number of positive reviews backing its effectiveness, I was confident in my purchase decision. However, it's worth noting that the cushion could be slightly larger to fit someone with longer legs. Overall, a solid choice for those seeking relief without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "Practice playing a lap steel guitar requires me to sit on a stool approximately 17\u201d high with no arms. Although the stool is padded to some extent, it does not protect my tail bone from becoming painful after a few minutes of sitting. After considering similar products, I settled on the ComfiLife Gel Enhanced Seat CusThe Comfilife does not collapse under my weight, and never gets warm. Because it is non-slip, I do not have to change my position once I sit. It includes a cover which can be removed, and hand washed. It provides 100 percent protection of my tail bone and remains very comfortable throughout a complete session. I purchased it for this specific purpose and have not tried it in office, or lounge chairs.I give it five stars, with only pros and no cons, and I highly recommend the ComfiLife Gel Enhanced Seat Cushion if you need something to protect your tail bone and provide superior comfort when seated.",
