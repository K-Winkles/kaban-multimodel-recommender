These maintain a consistent firmness that provides just the right amount of both comfort and support, and the contoured shape is much more effective that just a rectangular or round cushion. I have one in my car and another on my desk chair, and they have been a significant improvement in the quality of my daily life.",

                "reviewText": "So this seat is pretty good as far as softness and comfort goes. But... it's very shocking \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05 for weeks (apparently since I got this cushion), the static in the house has been crazy. Every single time I sat down and got up from my desk chair, I or whoever I touched would be shocked by static electricity. Sometimes painfully. It was driving me crazy. I finally figured out that this cushion was the cause, the cushion cover specifically. Without the cover, the foam doesn't make the static. So, I guess I will be making a new cover for it. If static electricity is not for you, then this seat cushion is not for you unless you can make a different cover.",
