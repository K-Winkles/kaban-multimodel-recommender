                "reviewText": "I basically have to sit and sleep in a recliner, and because of the poor quality of padding, I looked for something to sit on for comfort. Am 75 and for the 1st time have a bed sore on my posterior. It can be really painful. I bought this product, and it improved my situation 95%! I have encountered one small issue. If I end up sitting on the edge, obviously the honeycomb design will fold. When it fold, the edge puts pressure on my sore and it is extremely painful, because of the material if I scoot to change positions, it creates drag and worsens the pain. I have found that to be really comfortable, I need to not sit all the way back on the cushion. My suggestion would be to have a larger slip on case, but in that casing attach a border made of another material and is firm, but soft, so the original product sits down in it. That way, there would be a little more support and the edge of the original would not bend down so much! Also, if the case zipper was on 2 sides rather than one, it would make it a lot easier to remove for washing. I do love it, and plan to get the larger size, to maybe lay in my chair with the pad curved up a couple of inches on back of chair to avoid edges. Other than this, I found this pad to be extremely comfortable and I use it also in my wheelchair when I have to go somewhere.",

Ford Econoline and other dodge etc... I'm only 5\"6 with a 38-40 wasit and as much as my full butt does not get accommodated I'm not going to sit here and return the item because I already got rid of my memory foam sadly on each side I have to try to center this and hope to get my butt sitting in the middle it does not cradle my butt as good as the memory foam where it has more support I'm losing a little bit of inches on each side that's why I said 19x19 is perfect for my van and still be able to put a larger size if they come out with 21 in by 20 which still work as well I guess they don't realize not everyone drives a compact car with small seats they should let you have a couple of options but without losing the thickness like it is right now but I would love to see a 3-inch thickness in the future to give you that little bit more raise in the seat and I bet you it would also still have a better increase of the functionality of support",

Why don\u2019t people think of discomfort as a possibility with seemingly naughty or hyper kids? I think I would have performed better in school if I had had a cushion in my chair.",

                "reviewText": "Im giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the quality is inconsistent. I\u2019ve ordered 2 so far:The first one I ordered is perfect. Im sitting on it right now and it delivers everything it promises. I have hypermobility (my doctor thinks I have EDS) and have struggled with piriformis syndrome which causes a lot of sciatic pain whenever I sit.I sat on a cushion from a brand that rhymes with \u201cblurple\u201d and it was AMAZING, except for the expensive price tag. I scoured amazon for the closest affordable dupe and chose this one. The cushion is thick, comfortable, and cradles my butt bones and evens out the pressure of my rear end when I sit. I\u2019ve taken it on airplanes, in the car, and when I\u2019m sitting at work. It makes sitting bearable for me, so I can\u2019t recommend it enough.Around 2 months later I ordered another one for my mom, but when it came it was much stiffer and not as comfortable. They might\u2019ve changed the material that the insert is made of, but it\u2019s nowhere as squishy as the first one I bought.So, if the odds are right and you receive a cushion like the one I got the first time, you\u2019re in for a treat. If you receive a cushion like the second one I bought it\u2019s not as good.",
