Usually when I get off the flight I have tailbone pain for a few days, but using this cushion made a night and day difference. It is a little wide for the seats so you do have to squish it a little, and it is very unwieldy to get through the airport with, but worth the challenge! Also, I am a larger person (5'9\", 250lbs) , but was still able to put my seatbelt on no problem.Looking forward to using it with my desk chair, but haven't tried it yet.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for driving, I sit in a bus most of 8 hours during a day and although this is super soft and cushy it is not deep enough for a bus or even a car seat. Your thighs hang over the front edge and it creates a pressure point. I tried it in my jeep as well, no dice. I would return it but I already wrote my name in black sharpie on the side. I kinda bought this one because of reviews and that it was pink and wouldn't blend in with the actual black seat so I wouldn't leave it in the bus and night. Back to the drawing board. Note the depth and get the right size or you will be sorry.",

There are cheaper pads available, but I wanted one that would last.",
