For some reason our buddies in Beijing feel like they need to apply a 2 inch by 3 inch sticker with what must be Gorilla glue on the suede top of the cushion . It doesn\u2019t have any important information about the cushion , it simply lets the new owner , this side up , I\u2019ll admit to only a high school education but really , if I was not able to figure that out then I should not be behind the wheel of the truck I installed this in . I spent an hour trying to get all of the sticker off without tearing up the cover .. can\u2019t really say after picking , scraping, brushing , hot air and ice cubes I failed to get everything off . Please call our buddies and tell them to put the sticker on the plastic bottom . At least there , it really doesn\u2019t need to come off . The cushion does work fine though and the seller has been very responsive.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know how else to say it. I work from home so I'm sitting quite a bit, I got a standing desk, which helps, but was dealing with cumulative soreness in my hip joints that made the end of the work week terrible. I tried replacing my desk chair but as anyone knows that's really hit or miss, dropping a bunch of cash on something that you hope will work out...well, this time it didn't. The chair I got is not really that comfortable or supportive. Womp womp. I had a similarly shaped regular foam cushion that was getting flat and warped and hard that I've been using to try and make this loser chair work, but it was clear that it wasn't getting the job done. The backs of my thighs would be sore from the pressure of sitting on the edge of the seat and it was just overall miserable. Rather than buy yet another new chair I found this seat cushion. I have come to really love memory foam, it is magical stuff in a mattress so I thought I'd give this a shot.Let me just say from the very first time I sat on this cushion the difference was night and day. It feels very firm initially, but as your, um, tuckus warms up the foam it molds into the shape of your peaches. The edges of the cushion compress without lacking support, ending the cut off feeling I would get in the backs of my legs my from the edge of my chair and my old cushion. The more I sit, the more I don't feel any soreness. It is just short of a miracle. If I can use this cushion to get some more value out of this cruddy chair I bought it is well worth the cost.The best thing about memory foam is that it springs back up when you're not using it, so when you sit again later you sink in all over again. These magical cherubs fly back up and gently lift your hiney, cradling it so it's kept snug but without the pressure on your hips.I would say if you are at all on the fence about how good this cushion is, especially compared to others that may look similar but aren't made of memory foam, go for it. You have nothing to lose and cherub bum to gain.",
