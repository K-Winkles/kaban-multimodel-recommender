                "reviewText": "I'm trying not to get carried away, but this is a back changing, if not life changing cushion!The padding on my desk chair was worn out, and I was getting back pain from sitting on it. This FIXED that! It's a serious cushion, up to four inches thick in some places. It's got a dense foam inside that's still doing it's job a month later. It's got a grippy bottom, so it doesn't slide around on you, although it's easy to pick up and adjust the position. I think the serious cushioning AND the ergonomic shape work together to give you better posture while you're working, and it makes a huge difference if you put in hours seated at a desk! The only caveat is that for someone my size ( I'm tall and my legs don't fit the chair the same ) it can cut off the circulation in my legs, so I get pins and needles after too long - I take that as my cue to get up and walk around. I've never had a cushion make such a big change for the better in sitting comfort. Not only do I love it, but I'm getting some as Xmas gifts!",

                "reviewText": "I got this, because I work from home and after a few hours of sitting my back and legs get very sore. After a long day, I started to get sharp pain in my lower back. After a few months, I was starting to get neuropathy in my feet that was so bad, when I went to bed at night. After only a few days of use, the pain in my lower back and in my seat, started to go away. I also began to notice the the foot pain I had in my feet has almost went away completely! It is very firm, and I like how it molds to my bottom. There are only two things that I really don't like about it, but it's not a deal breaker. For one, it does create some space against the back part of my chair, so I will use a small pillow in the back. The other is that if you are a male, the part of the cushion in the front tends to be rather 'uncomfortable', if you know what I mean. I wish that it didn't have the large 'bulb' part in the front of the cushion. Other than that, compared to the other seat cushions that I have tried, it is AMAZING! The pain relief that it provides is fantastic and the cushion doesn't become flat and useless after a full days use!",
