I get injections but they don't work well. Sitting is very very painful. I needed to find relief and researched cushions. I'm telling you how wonderful sitting on this cushion is a life saver. I'm a large woman and it is a great size, extremely comfortable and sturdy. Three days after I received it I bought another one for my car. I'm telling you it's the best.",

                "reviewText": "I've had horrible pain from sitting and wasn't sure why. Apparently pain in the \"sits bones\" is a thing from what I've googled. Anyway, the pain is awful so I looked around and discovered these cushions with the double holes. One I saw on this site was ridiculously expensive and I refuse to be extorted for that kind of price but this one seemed more reasonable in cost, so I ordered.I first tried it in my office chair, which isn't a traditional office chair on wheels but more of a sitting chair/recliner that I use at my desk in my home office to watch TV on the PC. The chair is firm and has a relatively flat seat cushion, so I'm very surprised to say it works terribly in it. I don't understand why. At first I blamed the cushion and just assumed it didn't work.But then I tried the cushion in bed (I do a lot of sitting upright in bed to read or draw at night) and to my surprise it works great in bed. My bed is also firm (it's a thin Japanese style futon mattress) so I honestly don't understand why there's such a difference, but there is. So now I keep it in the bedroom and it works good, but I'm out of luck for my office chair, which is where I do most of my sitting and where I watch TV. It may be the chair or it may be my posture; I may slump or sit in a way that makes it not work as well, I can't say for sure. I do know I've tried various positions in the chair but the cushion just makes the pain worse, so I can only use it for sitting in bed.So, it does work, but it can apparently have a very different effect depending on what type of seat you use it on. The quality feels very good and it has a good grip on the bottom so it doesn't move around. It's quite heavy, almost too heavy - if I was able to use it in both rooms as I was hoping to do, it actually would have been annoying to carry around due to the weight, but it's okay since it stays in my bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "With a torn tendon acting like ischial bursitis, I chose this cushion based on its design and purported ergonomics. After using it for 1.5 weeks, my pelvic pain was healing much faster! However, I began developing strain on the outer sides of my thighs, mostly on the right side (torn tendon is on my left side). The right-side pain seemed to be greater trochonderic pain syndrome. But what caused this pain on my right side? Nothing in my daily routine had changed---all my daily exercise regimens were the same. The only change was the cushion! Sitting in it this AM, I felt aggravation of pain on both the right and left sides of the greater trochoter at the top of the femur (thigh bone). I am debating returning the cushion. I am 98 lbs, narrow framed, small to medium boned, and for anyone else, I should think this cushion would be too small---especially as it curves up on the sides, apparently to be more ergonomic ... but for me ... it seems to be the reason for my upper-outer thigh pain at the top of the femur. Before I purchased the cusion, I suspected a possible ergonomic problem from it---perhaps lower back pain, but nope, it seems the culprit for causing my new pain. All that said, I do want to reiterate that it did help immensely with the torn-tendon at the base of my pelvic bones both in healing and in terms of pain when sitting.",

Unfortunately I need to drive a few hours a day and this was becoming increasingly difficult to do. I ordered a few different seat cushions but they were all too hard or didn't have enough support in the tail bone area and still had too much pressure on the sit bones. While I was waiting for this one to arrive, I used rolled up towels which helped some. This cushion is soft enough that it's comfortable but firm enough that it's still supportive. The holes lined up nicely but I do need to adjust myself to make sure it's just right. I don't feel like I'm sitting on a booster seat and it's has really helped me stay comfortable when driving.",
