                "reviewText": "So i recently had hip replacement surgery and am waiting for my other hip to be replaced. Sitting on my computer chair while trying to work can be a nightmare so before i got a new chair i figured i would in the meantime get a cushion. Well, I'm going to have to get something different. It's not comfortable and seems to only stay in place or not hurt other parts of my body like my back if i sit up on it instead of how i should sit in it and then it slips away and the cushion seems to be not very good because after about an hour it feels like I'm sitting on a hardware floor. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't hurt my hip. but just my butt. So it kind of worked. Just not for me so I'll be searching again for something else.",

I was struggling with my tailbone pain for 2 weeks and when this came in the mail and I put it on my seat at work I felt so supported with the perfect amount of give. I will say that if you have a wider backside you might need to get the bigger size as the small one fits me perfectly but if I was any bigger it would be too small. I have legit recommended this to coworkers and friends because I want the best for them any myself so if you\u2019re struggling with tailbone pain pls do yourself a favor and buy this I promise it\u2019s worth it. \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I took a cross country road trip this summer. While my car is comfortable, I knew that after about hour 3 in the driver's seat, the gluteus maximus would protest. Before the trip, I tried many different cushions. My only misgiving was that it was thicker than any other one and I sat a little higher in the seat. I lowered my chair as low as it went and test drove it for a week before I left. In combination with a lumbar pillow I strapped to the seat, this seemed like a winning combination.I drove 9-12 hour days. It was like sitting on a cloud. When I would sit on the edge of the hotel bed at night and assess if I needed any Tylenol or Ibuprofen, I would realize that my back, shoulders, and rear end were not in pain. I would wake up in the morning and I knew it was the crappy hotel bed that made me achy and I would hurry to get in the driver's seat to relieve my pain. I do wish it was thinner so that I could take it on a plane and not feel like a toddler in a booster seat. But in the car, I sit like a queen on my throne.",

Whereas before I would be feeling twinges after about 20mins of sitting, I can now sit for 1/2 hours before experiencing any pain.I also appreciate the little guide included with washing instructions and some exercises/holds to help alleviate pain by strengthening the glutes and lower back muscles. I haven't checked out their site but they have video tutorials available too.",
