I would recommend adding a strap that would fasten behind your seat to keep it in place when entering or exiting your vehicle. It's annoying to keep moving back into place. It's comfortable, doesnt hold smells, adequate thickness and helps with butt pain on long distance driving.",

Its grate for another chair that I have downstairs that is smaller. Highly recommend the seat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a Camry hybrid last year and it makes no sense to me why Toyota would make a car with such great mileage and poor comfort. I decided to give this cushion a try because if I can\u2019t take a road trip then what was the point? Previously driving past 3 hours was pretty uncomfortable. I drove to New Orleans in two 5.5 hour shifts on consecutive days because I still don\u2019t want to be in the car too much. Well it\u2019s gotta be 2 to 3 times more comfortable with fatigue also reduced following. I actually dont really like to use on short trips when I\u2019m at home because it will move a little as it has no strap. Maybe dycem on bottom would help that. Regardless I will order another for my daughter.",
