                "reviewText": "Since I started working from home in 2020, I've gone through two chairs and a number of cushions and pillows. The whole time, I've been fighting skin irritation and soreness. I think I've even gotten bed sores. I never had this problem at work, and I think it's because all the chairs I've ever used were upholstered. It seems difficult to fins a chair with good back support (I want something to STOP me when I lean back) that wasn't vinyl. I like the chair I have now because it's high enough at its lowest level. We all know office chairs die by staying low.I tried seat cushions, but they were buttoned and lumpy. I tried feathered pillows, but they somehow failed. The irritation would almost go, but then inch its way back. I tried baby powder, Gold bond, Hydrocortisone, zinc... everything.I was about to spend $400 on yet another chair when I decided that maybe my butt can truly breathe this way. I found this cushion and gave it a try before making a big purchase. Well, I've had it a week or two now and my butt is completely healed. I can't believe there's nothing about relieving skin irritation in the hype about this pillow! It talks about breathing, and sciatica and support, but makes no hype about sensitive skin.I saw a negative review about the cushiness of the cushion. I couldn't care less about that. My chair is already comfortable in that regard. My butt can breathe now, and it 100% irritation free all the time now.I feel like I want to buy an even bigger version of this as a backup.",
