                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with my purchase. Well worth the money. It does come rolled up but it immediately decompresses as soon as you take it out of the bag. I did not notice or have not noticed any permanent creasing in the materials nor when I sit on this comfy cushion.I will say this. It is a very firm cushion compared to the others that I have tried.(Ex Serta and various gel seat cushions etc.)I have severe arthritis, herniated disc and nerve damage in my back down into my legs. This the hands down best seat cushion I have ever used!!It has relieved 90% of my pain while sitting.One key thing to be mindful of this cushion is THICK!!! But it's nice and it settles in nicely once you get adjusted to how it conforms to your butt.I did order the lumbar pillow immediately upon sitting on this cushion because due to the shape of the seat cushion it pushes me off the back of my chair because of the size and shape. *Not a deal breaker*But you will not be disappointed!!!!I'm hoping with ordering the lumbar cushion it will also help reduce pain and help my posture sitting at my desk and void the space the seat cushion creates.Honestly, it's probably a marketing tactic, but honestly I don't care.Did I mention this thing is super comfortable?Don't hesitate if you have back pain or any other type of pain associated with your hip region and legs or just want to have a comfy seat!!YOU FOUND IT!! \ud83d\udcaf",

                "reviewText": "I have the same cushion at home that came directly from Cushion Lab & I notice a difference with this one purchased from Amazon. The one from Cushion Lab is firm with nice support & is more comfortable. This one is supportive as well, but it's harder & not as comfortable. I bought the Amazon one for work where I sit at a desk for 9 hours a day so I thought that it would \"break in\" but it's been over a month & it's still pretty hard. It's too late to return it so I'll probably swap it with the one at home. This one was about the same price as the one on Cushion Lab so I recommend buying directly from Cushion Lab. On the plus side, if I didn't have the other one to compare it to, this isn't bad. It has a nice grip on the bottom so that it doesn't slide all over my chair. It does boost me up some so I sit taller at my desk which has helped my shoulder pain. I type most of the day, so when I was sitting lower, my shoulders were bunched up causing pain. I also feel like I have better posture with the cushion.",

Also if you\u2019re going to use this in your car just be ware that you\u2019ll need to adjust your seat depending on the weather. In the winter here the foam gets a little stiff so I have to lower my seat. But no biggie. I still recommend.",

I have purchased and tested a number of these cushions in the past finding that most will generally hold thier form and last for a few months if your lucky. The quality of this device is superior to any of the rest I have tried and am pleased that it is so durable yet comfortable.",

It is so good, I wanted to order one for my mum for her birthday. She is in the UK and there was only one option on Amazon UK (in the US there is a variety of colors and 2 sizes) and just going on the picture, it looks a little thinner than the one I have...but I cannot confirm this. I also work in International retail and I get it - we cannot offer the variety that we can in the US - so that didn't bother me too much - but holy hotcakes - DOUBLE the price??? Yes, 2 times what I paid. For that reason alone, I have dropped my star rating. My cushion lab cushion here in the US is completely awesome. My mum, who is 94, seems to like it - and I hope it is twice as good as mine :)",
