The little pumps that come with them are nearly useless. I finally ended up using my air compressor to force air in.Once inflated they only do a fair job of padding whatever you're sitting on. Maybe OK for kids or lighter adults but too light and flimsy for any heavy use.",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple of chairs that get uncomfortable if I sit too long. My experience with buying pillows has not been great because everything always ends up being too high when I get it, which throws my back and neck out of whack. I ordered this pair of inflatable pillows because I thought being able to regulate the height and stiffness might be a good thing.I filled one pillow for my desk chair with a small amount of air and another for a chair I watch TV in with more air. So far, the one that has the smaller amount of air is amazing and just what I've been looking for. The other one is OK but a tiny bit high.The pillows have a little plug where you insert the air. If I want to have less air, I could just leave this open and I imagine the one chair will adjust to be just right. The deflate-ability is also a nice feature for storing these pillows if you don't need them for a while.These pillows come with two air pumps, which is overkill for one person. However, if you were going to break down the set and leave one at work and when at home, it would be handy not to have to transport the air pump back and forth.This is my first experience with a refillable pillow. At first, it seemed like I was pumping and getting nowhere. Just when I was about ready to give up, the pillow magically filled with air. So, in addition to getting some pillows that will work well for me, I also got a show in the process too!I enthusiastically recommend these inflatable pillows.",
