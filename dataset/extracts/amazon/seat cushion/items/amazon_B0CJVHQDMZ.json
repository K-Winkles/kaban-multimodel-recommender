I realized the two chairs I used most frequently are not cushioned, so I grabbed this on sale. I got the smallest version and it fits perfectly on a typical dining or folding chair. I'm 5ft, 170 so my tush is not tiny. I think it does it's job. I don't see how any improvements can be made. Sometimes when you hurt, nothing entirely helps, but it is a big improvement. If you are like me and don't realize that your typing posture is less than stellar it will throw you off a day or so bc you are actually sitting his you are supposed to sit. It is not heavy so a person who has mobility issues shouldn't have any problems moving it around. It doesn't slide as it has little rubber nubs on the bottom. This would also be good for someone like myself who basically needs a booster seat to drive. I don't see how there could be any improvement, though I think a man or someone with a large chair would enjoy a larger cushion.",

                "reviewText": "No where does this say firm or any other words that would indicate this is a firm cushion.That being said, this is more on the softer side and not as thick as the 3 inch cushions I have . This cushion is 2 1/2 inches thick ,yes I measured both of my cushions. {see my review on other cushion}The thickness of a cushion doesn't tell the whole story,it's the type of cushion they use ,and by that I mean cushion density.This cushion is thinner and softer so it is less dense. My other cushion is way more dense and thicker at 3 inches {see my recent review on that cushions review}.Now, this is made well ,good construction , but if you are over 170 lbs this might be too soft for you,meaning it will flatten out some to about 1 1/2 inches to maybe 1 inch . If under 170lbs and you don't mind a softer cushion and don't like them too firm, then by all means buy this.If you like a firmer cushion and don't want the cushion to flatten out as much and over 170lbs then see my recent review on that cushion. It's not a hard firm ,just medium firm,very nice. <-------- then buy this one .As for me I use both at different times depending upon how I feel. My weight is around low 160's and evenly proportioned so both work for me.Thanks for taking the time to read my reviews ,I take them seriously.",
