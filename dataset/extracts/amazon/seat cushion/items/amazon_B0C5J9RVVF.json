                "reviewText": "I purchased this product as I have a long trip coming up and I need support on that long drive that I'm about to make. I was looking through Amazon to find one that was for a good price but also that had good reviews with a product that would deliver the support needed, and I came across this one and I like the reviews that it had which made me make the decision to buy it. I just received it today I was excited to open it but as soon as I opened it upon unzipping it from its case so that I can see the cushion it took me by surprise seeing that it looked as if it had already been used or if it had been damaged by something I don't know what to make of it but from what I've seen on the pictures of this product and on some pictures of reviews theirs don't look like that so I just don't know what to make of it. It's really disconcerting and makes me question if I received a used one when I paid for a new one or if it got damaged somewhere in the warehouse it just looks very questionable I don't know what to make it which is why I'm giving it three stars, there's also what look like tiny hairs like from a clipper which makes me think that if I did receive a used one somebody that was like a barber might have had it I don't know. I'm hoping to get an answer about it and then I will change my rating. Other than that it feels very plush I like the thickness of it, the cooling gel I like very much it feels very cool to the touch very comfortable as well to the touch which I'm guessing once sat upon will be very comfortable and supportive the only bad thing is just that used look that it has as you can see in the pictures. I'm hoping I can get a explanation because I was really excited and really wanted this one as it seemed like it was going to be the one to give that cooling support.",

You don't ever have to adjust it one inch this way or that. This is what all seat cushions should be. Thank you, Amazon, for making my life just a bit more comfortable. It came before I expected it, so I'm enjoying just a bit more.",
