The central inner hole measures 7\" x 4.5\". What weight does the pillow support? The supportive, high density polyurethane foam core supports weights up to 240 lbs (108kg) Can I wash the pillow? For optimum hygiene the pillow comes with a removable, machine washable cover. The inner foam cannot be machine washed. How do I use the donut pillow so it is positioned correctly? Place the donut on any hard seating surface (office chair, dining room chair etc) with the \"U\" cut outs placed towards the front and back of your seat. For tailbone pain relief your coccyx should be suspended over the \"U\" to provide sitting relief. What makes the Ergonomic Innovations cushion different? Over 750,000 people just like you have tried and trusted the Ergonomic Innovations pillow for superior sitting relief. Using BounceBack Foam Technology you can rely on sitting support day after day after day. Highly resilient and durable to last.",

The hole in the middle is bigger than others that I've tried, and the material is great. Some donut pillows add extra pressure but this one doesn't! I also love that you can take the cover off to wash it. Great purchase!",

And you can remove and wash the pillow casing.The center hole is retangular, and because of this you can position it as you like. If your behind is narrow you can position it with the hole elongated. If you are heavy set then you would position it the long retangular way.It is a wonderful tool!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using an old computer chair for the last 20 years and the cushioning is all but nonexistent so i bought this to replace the pillow i've been sitting on. Overall it's a very dense but comfortable foam. The footprint, or should i say buttprint, is a little on the small size. I'm not a small dude but i'm also not a huge dude. i find that it is just big enough but feels like it could be an extra couple inches on all sides. It also could use another inch or two of padding. Clearly it's not meant as a long term solution but it works and probably makes an excellent short term pad for maybe a wooden dining chair or someone working for short periods of time at a desk.",
