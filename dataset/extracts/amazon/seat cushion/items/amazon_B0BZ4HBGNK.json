The only down side is the cover for the cushion is made of a cloth that could be less rough.

I didn't expect much in terms of pain relief, but this pad actually helps - not bad for the price~",

Her desk chair is too firm by itself and she added this cushion for extra comfort and support. She uses this cushion all day every day, she says it's very comfortable and helps to relieve her pain when she sits on it.",
