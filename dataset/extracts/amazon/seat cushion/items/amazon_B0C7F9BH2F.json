You cannot put the side flaps over the sides and have it sit flush. They also slide around on the leather seats. Also the leather of the cover starts wearing pretty quickly. Was hoping for a better fit and product.Update, also just tried on in a 2000 Chevy Silverado and it's also not as wide as the seat. You won't be able to put the side flaps down. You can leave the side flaps tucked up and under and it will sit there, bit still not protecting the whole seat. If it fit I was going to look into the tan/brown ones for my truck.I would only recommend using these in small SUV's, crossovers, and mid size to compact cars.",

                "reviewText": "These were guaranteed to fit my vehicle and they DO NOT. My seats contain a hard plastic wall between the seat and floor, non removable, with no spaces; so the elastic cord on the front of the seat cushion that goes beneath the seat can NOT go beneath the seat. My seats have a flipper lever mechanism on the side, which you use when you want to incline or fold the back of the seat, forward. The cushion's sides do not fit in the limited space between the flipper and the seat; you cannot press the side of the seat cushion material into the available space as you are supposed to do, the cushion material is too thick to fit no matter how hard you try. So the cushion is entirely wrong for my vehicle, 100% wrong. I really do not appreciate this hassle. Do your homework, Motor Trend, have some professional pride in getting it right. It's a lie that it fits; in no way even comes close to fitting.",
