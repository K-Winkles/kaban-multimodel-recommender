I tried it as the cushion underneath me at first, and it worked very well for that, but then I switched it to my lumbar cushion. It has been very comfortable, and is providing nice, additional support to the standard chair that I currently have set up as my desk chair. So far, the memory foam has stayed in its original form, and I would say it has a moderate firmness to it, but it never gets so firm that it makes my back hurt from prolonged usage. The material is washable (not the memory foam itself, but that is expected), and it seems to be tough and durable with good stitching to hold up to the pressures of being repeatedly sat upon, as well as shifting yourself on the chair. It is a great option for extra back or rear support while seated. I can\u2019t find a thing wrong with it, and the price is fair as well.",

Whether I sit at my desk chair with this cushion under my bum or driving in my car with the cushion behind my low back, it creates comfort and feels great. It reminds me of a thick pillow version of a gel insole for my shoes. You\u2019ve just got to try it and see for yourself. I highly recommend this cushion! It also has a non-slip backing so it stays in place pretty well.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to help my husband's back while driving his truck. He does like it and says it helps. Very comfortable. But it kept falling out every time he got out of the truck. And the cover gets pushed down and wadded up when using. I sewed adjustable straps to the back of the cover. These go around the seat and hold the cushion in place. Now it works perfectly. Good cushion but needs some way to keep it in place.",

Unlike other items we've seen on Amazon, this cushion seems larger than it appeared in its description. In our case larger is better.I had originally ordered the cushion to be used on my recumbent trike, but it turned out to be too big for the trike. Now it's perfect for my wife's desk chair.",
