But when it reached its full size in a few hours my lower back pain finally had some relief and along with my messaging pillow and tense unit I could relax and moved better. This is just what I was searching for at an excellent price. I can put it in my tote bag and take it with me, wash it. I may buy a second for travel and purchase or make a cover that can be wiped clean. I do recommend it for lumbar cushion comfort.",

Great deal, need them on almost every chair in my house, no matter what kind it is. so important to keep your lower back supported. soft, like a cushion, not deep like an office chair. they hold their shape, come vacuum sealed and puff out in a few hours after opening.",
