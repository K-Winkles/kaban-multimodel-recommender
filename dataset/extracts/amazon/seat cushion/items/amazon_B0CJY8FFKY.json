                "reviewText": "This little \"pillow\" is more than what I could have imagined or designed.I say pillow because before this cushion, I used to use a pillow and no pillow worked well. In fact, it seemed like they made it worse. It was a toss-up on which was worse, nothing at all or the wrong one. My legs and back would hurt within 5-10 minutes and I couldn't even check email in that time!But, with this cushion, it is like sitting on clouds in comparison! This cushion is designed for my body, with the memory foam fitting perfectly to the shape of my body and especially over time, as I use it.Now, I have to admit, at first, it was not that comfortable, in the first 30 seconds and I had wondered if I had made a mistake. But, it was also cold, as I had just pulled it out of the box, and it had been delivered in almost freezing (by my standards LOL) temperature. So, that does make a difference. If you wait for it to reach room temperature, that makes a difference. Also, if you sit on the cushion, your body heat warms up the cushion AND the cushion starts to change to the shape of your body, even within minutes!The firmness of the cushion was a major plus, as well. I thought that something cushy and soft would be the most comfortable, but as we learn in life, that is the opposite of what is best for our bodies and what actually helps with the pain. Even as I type this, I can feel my back getting the support it needs, and it is as if this surge of \"thankfulness\" is going up my spine because it is the way it is supposed to be, thanks to the firmness of this cushion. If my bones could speak, they definitely would be saying, \"Thank you!\" So, I will say it for them!",

                "reviewText": "I am on a never ending quest to find the perfect seat cushion\u2026 this one isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s pretty good. Ergonomic design is supportive and relatively comfortable. It\u2019s a little firmer than other cushions I\u2019ve used, which I actually prefer because it doesn\u2019t get \u201ccrushed\u201d in the first 10 minutes. Like all cushions (in my opinion), you still need to get up and let it expand again to provide longer lasting support. I\u2019ve flipped it over and have sat on the rubbery side as well as the \u201cup\u201d side, and that works too. It has a correct orientation, but I\u2019ve found I can use it turned both ways and still have it be effective. I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d / 175 and the size if fine for me, but to be honest I have a pretty small area that comes into contact with the cushion. I would have liked to see a handle of some sort built in so could carry it with me to a sporting event or theater, but that\u2019s a small nitpick. I like to switch cushions out once or twice throughout the day, and this one is a good option to have in my stable of effective seat cushions.",

I was excited to try this and hopefully get relief.When it is positioned correctly and i sit for several hours, I do not feel nearly as sore as I do without it. It works as advertised. My main complaint is that the bottom is not quite grippy enough. Throughout the day it shifts and slides back, likely due to my chair having a slight tilt but also likely due to not having a strong enough gripping mechanism to hold it in place. When it\u2019s not positioned correctly it does nothing. If you have a flat hard surface chair, like a dining chair, I think it would work better than the mesh chair I currently have.",
