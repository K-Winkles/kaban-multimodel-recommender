                "media_text": "What are the benefits of using a seat cushion? Sitting for long periods of time can cause discomfort in the back, hips, and coccyx. Without proper cushioning, that discomfort becomes more agitated. Adding a chair pad to your office accessories lineup helps take the pressure off your lower body. Does the seat cushion help with tailbone pain? A chair that lacks proper support creates excess pressure on your back, tailbone, and hips. Adding an ergonomic seat cushion lifts your tailbone above hard seating surfaces so sitting is more comfortable for 8+ hours while you work, study, or travel. What sets this seat cushion apart from all the others? Made with our high density ComfortFoam with AdaptivTemp Tech that expertly distributes body weight to relieve pressure without ever flattening, comes with a breathable, washable cover, and is made with high quality, certified safe materials. How to use this seat cushion? Place the seat cushion on any chair with the Everlasting Comfort logo at the front and the U-shaped coccyx cutout at the back. Is this seat cushion washable? Yes. Simply unzip and remove the cover and machine wash. Tumble dry with low or no heat.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s important to understand from the start that if you suffer from back pain, this will help but it is NOT an immediate fix.Pros: Thick quality padding, no \u201cfunny smells,\u201d matches black office chairs, comfortable to sit it for a full 8-12 hour shift, does not make you sweaty.Cons: Not wide enough to cover entire buttocks area (I\u2019m a size 18), need to re-center the pillow every time I sit down again.Experience: I suffered a great deal of tailbone discomfort and pain from sitting hours a day in an office chair with nearly no padding. I did not have enough money to buy a new chair, I\u2019m trying to be frugal. After 2 and a half weeks of using this product with my office chair, my back/tailbone pain was completely gone. It does exactly what it needs to do and takes the weight off your tailbone and back.Sometimes, I have to shoo the cat off it because she finds it comforting too. I\u2019m considering buying another for my cat. She is a \u201cprincess\u201d and likes to sit on the finest quality products only. I could probably fix the re-centering issue with some double-sided tape or Velcro.Quick Summary: Worth the money, great quality, not a fast-fix for your back pain but helps greatly in the long-term.",

However, it is not soft, meaning, I don't feel like I am being cushioned. The butt doesn't hurt when sitting on it, and maybe it conforms to shape, but doesn't seem to \"give\" when sitting on it. Definitely it gives me support, and provides a good lift which is one reason I bought it - to raise me up higher in the chair. For that it is excellent. Would I purchase it again - maybe.",

                "reviewText": "I have a seriously ill lady, with many major problems. She's been in hospitals now for several months, and has become extremely deconditioned. To get back and forth to doctors, when she's out of the hospital, we use a medical transport system. It's an important service, but there's often a wait of at least an hour. KF, as I'll call her, has no body muscle, no subcutaneous fat, and no padding at all. She has to sit in a wheelchair, waiting. Then there's the bumpy ride, then the doctor appointments, a ride back and so forth.This lady has so much pain in her tail-bone, it's excruciating. She's in tears after about 10 minutes, and can hardly bear it during one of the appointment days. It's terrible! Then there's wheeling to meals at the facility, PT and other sitting events. She can't stand up, and never gets a chance to build muscles before the next medical crisis.Why the long story? Because today, we gave this cushion a test run. KF was in the ICU for 4 days, and released for transport, scheduled at 1:30pm. They got her into the chair with the new cushion, using a power lift, at around 1:15pm. We sat for 1 hour and 10 minutes, before the transport showed up. I kept asking her, \"How's your tail-bone?\" \"Fine!\"The ride was about half an hour, then a bit of wait until she could be lifted out of the chair, back to bed. By the time I showed up, about 3 hours had passed and I didn't know what I'd find. Usually, she's in such pain she gets a Vicodin, and can hardly function for the rest of the day. Not this time!Using this cushion, KF was about as \"normal\" as she'd been prior to getting into the wheelchair! Unbelievable! No tail-bone problems, no muscle cramping, no leg pain, no shoulder pain, and no arm and elbow pain, from trying to constantly adjust in the chair. Since she can't move much, it's very hard for her to even squirm around at the moment, but she didn't have to!This is a superb pillow. We've had it only one day, but I can't believe how much we're pinning our hopes on something so basic. Back at the facility, I showed it to a guy who's lost a leg and had major cellulitis. His spine has degenerated to bone-on-bone, and he can barely sit in a wheel-chair for more than an hour. There's nothing he can do, but he's robust, has a solid body with a lot of padding, but has almost no spinal support whatsoever. He was astonished at how comfortable we was when we tried out the pillow.Fingers crossed, hoping it lasts. I've rarely seen something that provides so much relief in such a basic way.UPDATE: This is absolutely a lifesaver! Within 1 week of using the cushion, KF's tailbone was mostly healed. She can now sit for the many hours in waiting rooms, PT or other problems.TIP: If you're using this with incontinence situations, definitely by two! If there's an issue, the outer fabric covering is easy to wash. But the inner memory foam isn't so easy, and takes forever to dry. MAJOR TIP: You can take off the outer casing, then cover the foam cushion with a 13-gal trash bag. Replace the casing, and the plastic bag isn't noticeable at all when used for sitting. However, it prevents liquids from soaking into the foam. The cushion is so critical you'll want a backup while the outer casing for the soiled one is in the wash.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had a lumbar spinal fusion and have bought several different types of seat cushions. I also went to three different medical supply stores. I found a seat cushion that did a fairly good job, but then I found this one! They are so comfortable that I plan on buying several more so I have one in my car and craft room. The gel infused cushion has just the right amount of give, but still provides structure making you feel well secured. The coccyx cutout is the perfect size to keep pressure off you tailbone. I am not one to take the time to write reviews, but if you or someone you know has had back surgery, they need this cushion. It is extremely difficult to sit comfortably afterwards, often times you can only stand or lay down, but this cushion allows you sit and be pretty dang comfortable while doing so. I was also really happy to see that I could purchase it with my FSA card! Worth every penny and then some!",
