                "reviewText": "I loved this product when I first started using it. It is very comfortable and helps with my lower back pain. However, after about 2 weeks of using the product, it no longer holds air. Once inflated it deflates in about an hour. I tried to return the item, but it was outside of the return window. Disappointed as it has the potential to be a great product, just not durable long term.",

                "reviewText": "Despite the product's advertised description and dimensions, it was incredibly uncomfortable to sit on, and wasn't usable. It didn't \"give\" in the right places no matter the inflation, or sufficiently at all, and the material and construction of it was harder and rougher than expected. I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this thing to anyone.",
