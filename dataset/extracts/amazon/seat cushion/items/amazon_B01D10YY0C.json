Die heutige Einheit von 50 Minuten war kein Vergleich zu vorher.Das Kissen erf\u00fcllt voll und ganz seinen Zweck. Es rutscht nicht weg und polstert gut.Wie es nach einiger Zeit vom Schwei\u00df her aussieht, kann ich nat\u00fcrlich nicht sagen. Der Sitz l\u00e4sst sich ja gut abwischen, das geht beim Kissen nicht.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung.",
