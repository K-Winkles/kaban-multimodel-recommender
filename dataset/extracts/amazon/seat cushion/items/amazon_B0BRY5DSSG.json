I had a hard time getting on the pillow while trying to get in our Jeep. It does have the separation in the front for your legs to be a little lower. It has a carrying handle on it which makes it easy to take anywhere. Soft on the butt. I don't like that it is 4 inches all the way around. It made it hard for me to touch the floor with my feet. Seems to keep its shape. It did take about a day and a half to get it totally expanded. I would highly recommend this pillow if you were in a car where your getting in and out closer to the ground. it would work for me then. I am now using it on my office chair at home where I can lower the chair and it is great.",

                "reviewText": "The size of 16\" x 17\" is quite small. I am 6' tall, 222 lbs. but I am not \"wide\" in my seat, I am narrow even. I hang off every side of this thing. I feel like I'm trying to balance on it and not just fall off. The manufactured depressions for your sitting side are tiny. It may be better suited to a much smaller person, perhaps best for a child. If you are a small person, It may be pretty good. If you are not, I wouldn't buy this product. It is not comfortable for me.",
