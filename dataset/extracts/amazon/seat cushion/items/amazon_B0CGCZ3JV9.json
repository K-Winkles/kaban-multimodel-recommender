                "reviewText": "Got this TPE Seat Cushion primarily to use for road trips in my RV. The RV is on a Ford Transit chassis and the stock Ford seats are not known for being comfortable. I've only been able to do a few short trips (30 minutes or less each) with the cushion so far, but this cushion is significantly more comfortable than the stock seats!The non-skid bottom keeps the cushion from sliding around on the seat, which is good because it's a few inches shorter from front to back than the stock Transit seat. This actually makes the cushion not quite as comfortable as it could be, because my thighs angle down from the cushion to the original seat before the drop off to the floor. (Hopefully that makes sense!)Keep in mind that this cushion with its memory foam is thick! 3+ inches tall means you may need to adjust your seat down. Unfortunately, my seat was already adjusted down all the way, so now I'm sitting a little taller than I like. Not a deal breaker for me, particularly because of the added comfort, but something to consider.",

                "reviewText": "This adds a good level of support but I wish it was overall a bit bigger, as it sort of leaves my front legs dropping down with a few inches left of the chair, and because of the slope, it sometimes feels like you're sliding out of the chair. The cover feels like it's just a little too small for the foam & silicone like material inside though, as it is actually more comfortable without it on, but then it looks bad and probably wouldn't hold up as well. The correct way to sit on it is like in the pictures, with the gap in the back (for your tailbone) and the hump in the front so that there are grooves for your legs.For someone like me with barely any \"junk in the trunk\" it can be very uncomfortable to sit on chairs without enough support or cushion, and this does the trick. It's much better at dissipating heat as well, so no more sweaty feeling after long office days or gaming sessions. I also probably need a new chair as the material is cracking in spots, and this elevates my legs away from that spot, which is a nice bonus.",
