                "reviewText": "Oh my what a difference this seat cushion makes. Given the fact that my office chair is 7 or 8 years old. I use it everyday for work. Sometimes if for an hour or two others I\u2019m in it for 8-10 hours with breaks of course. I need a new chair\u2026I know. But until then, the chair\u2019s seat cushion padding has bottomed out. At least that\u2019s what my butt tells me and my lower back confirms.I have come to terms that I am getting older (51) and refused to be that way. But I am to the point. I need to be comfortable. So here I am!This Seat Cushion Pressure Relief for Long Sitting Home & Office Chair Cushion is been a world of difference. It\u2019s like a cloud. So much better than sitting on pillow, for sure. I have no issues with sliding out from under me. The cushioning so far seems to maintain allowing for constant relief of pressure. The memory foam is of excellent quality, the ounce back is memorable and quick. I am able to get up from my chair, go grab a drink from the kitchen, or what ever it is I am doing, and then return to a heaven of softness. Wow! So great!!!I\u2019m getting one of these for the truck, its so fantastic.The memory foam is of wonderful quality, like i already mentioned, great bounce back. The top and sides of the exterior pillow case is constructed of durable stretchable fabric. The bottom is stitch to the upper and side portion of the pillow case making it a one-piece cover, that is removable from the foam cushion. A zipper closure allow the cushion to be fully encased providing a sleek stylish design also presenting a clean modern look. Super ell constructed and extremely easy to care and maintain. The removable case allows it to cleaned and washed separate from the foam cushion.The cushion has a small foot print and easy to transport from office chair to car or where ever you need it. Fits nicely to any condition needed.So soft and heavenly. A relief of comfort in any situation.",

My only complain is how slippery it is, even though it has a grippy material underneath. I swear every time I get up from my desk I have to readjust the cushion, which is a pain. Eventually I got tired of it and just decided to put it in my car to use from road trips instead. It doesn\u2019t seem to slide nearly as much when I get in and out of my car!",
