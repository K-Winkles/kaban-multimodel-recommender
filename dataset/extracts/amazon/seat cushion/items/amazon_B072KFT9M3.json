I could not drive more than 45 minutes before the pain made me ask my wife to continue. Now with the cushion I can do much better. We drove about 275 miles last weekend with only one stop for lunch and during the trip I had NO problems with pain. It takes a little getting used do as the pillow or cushion makes you sit a little higher than normal and is a bit strange feeling at first but after about 15 minutes you'll get used to it. I rated it a 3 for pain relief because I still haven't tried it on a really long trip but for my most recent one it worked fine.",

                "reviewText": "This cushion has saved me-It is excellent. I have had relief from the first day I have cancer in my lumbar spine L2 & L5- and a hefty compression fracture on L5. Ive just had it for four days and my pain has been cut by half- 7-8 level pain to a 3-4 on the usual scale zero to 10. Oncologist says it\u2019s the impingement from the compression fracture. The pain starts at the lumbar sacral juncture & radiates thru hips into both quads. I reckon it must be like severe sciatica with lower back involved 3 fold. My feet & toes also affected- it was brutal. but improved since the cushion. I sleep in a recliner - which was my only relief- but with this cushion - I can sleep and the agony has stepped down to moderate aching pain that is tolerable. I have been able to reduce the pain meds by one dose at least in a 24 hour period. Everyone is different, but it sure helps me!Thank you for providing this. Thank you so much",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to hopefully help my butt not be so sore when i am working at my desk. I bought this pair so i could give one to my boyfriend as well. He didnt like it so I keep one on my computer chair and one in my car. The one at my computer chair I feel has gone pretty flat by now. It doesnt feel as firm or like it is doing much other than being slightly softer than what it would feel like without it on my chair. If i were to throw a plain pillow under my butt it would probably feel about the same. Just slight cushionThe one in my car though, is still super firm. The only reason for that is I rarely leave or drive my car. Maybe once or twice a month. I work from home mainly so it still has its thick firm form to it, even when it gets scorching hot in the car. I am tempted to switch them but i enjoy having what feels like a bit of a booster seat in my car because im a bit short.I would probably not buy another intentionally. If there was a day i needed one do to surgery with short recovery then maybe yeah but for long use, no. I felt it was worth buying and using for the time it lasted for the price. I doubt there are any of these made that would hold firm for a lifetime. For the time it lasted it did feel as if it helped. Best of luck to and hope this review helped others.",

                "reviewText": "My truck seat sits low so my knees are above my waist while I drive and I kept experiencing back pain while driving an hour or more. I felt that if I could get up higher it would be alieviated. I tried a regular foam pillow for a bed. It just squished down over time and only delayed the pain rather than fixing it. I tried another seat cusion for vehicles that was gel and although it was very comfortable and squishy on the cheeks it had the same issue as the foam pillow. I purchased this cushion several months back and had been ecstatic. PROBLEM SOLVED! Made a four hour drive shortly after my purchase and prepared for the worst... stepped out of the truck and my back felt no worse than it did when I first got onto the road. If you\u2019re worried because you\u2019ve read that it is kind of stiff and doesn\u2019t allow you to sink into it... that\u2019s the point! It is helping with your posture. Also if it were any thinner than it is when gives that little bit of squish it would be a pancake... again defeating the purpose like the others that I have tried. Thank you for a great product! You have helped to bring back my pleasure in road trips.",

                "reviewText": "If you truly have medical needs by which you could benefit from some relief in the sacral area while sitting, this won\u2019t be supportive enough. I suffer from sciatica caused by disc herniations and the instant I sat on the cushion I could feel where the cut out is and it felt pretty good, but in a matter of seconds the whole thing was flattened and compressed, bringing my tail bone down again by the weight of my body, and pressure felt evenly dispersed on the seat again, making the cut out useless. The cushion is a few inches thick but the memory foam is not dense enough and flattens down to almost nothing. I feel this would be the case even if I was as light as a feather. But even if your just looking for a seat cushion for mere comfort I would suggest something better.",
