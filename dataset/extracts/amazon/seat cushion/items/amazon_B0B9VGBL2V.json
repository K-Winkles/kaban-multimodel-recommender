The cover is easy to wash in the washer and dry in the dryer. It doesn't shrink or lose its' shape. I can tell a big difference when it's not on my computer chair. I highly recommend this cushion to anyone who wants pressure relief while sitting for long periods of time.",

I wanted a seat cushion that made sitting long hours more bearable and this cushion fulfilled all my expectations!The cushion is very comfortable and soft to the touch. I feel more support in my lower back and bottom. I like that I can remove the cover if it needs to be cleaned. What also stands out about this cushion is that it does not slide or slip. It stays put on my seat, despite me getting up or shifting my seating position.I highly recommend this cushion for those who work long hours behind a desk! I no longer have pain on my bottom after a long study session :)",

There also seems to be a tear appearing and seems to get bigger every day of use. From only a couple month use. However I did get a refund so customer service seems pretty good.",
