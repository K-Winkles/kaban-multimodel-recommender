                "reviewText": "My only complaint is that after a while (2-3 hrs) of sitting I can feel pressure on my tailbone due to my size and weight (250lbs) flattening the cushion. I think I would have liked it better if it was shaped to a butt instead of just a regular rectangle. Or if there was a space for the tailbone, like a little divot. When I use other cushions with it, to keep pressure off of my tailbone, it works great. Can sit longer with no pain in my tailbone. I also, wish that there was some form of material on the bottom of the pad so it would not be so slippery. Seems like I am always adjusting due to the pad slipping out of my seat. The material is strong that covers the pad unlike other pads I have used and has not ripped even with my kids grabbing it.",

These two things make it extremely easy to move around with it, as I use it as a cushion to throw onto the floor when I want to sit on the floor, as a cushion for my knees if I am kneeling on the floor, and for my walker thing with wheels if I have to sit on that for a while. As its so versatile, light, and with the handle..its so easy to use it for all of those things, and probably many more. Wheras some other cusions I tried were bulky, heavier at over twice the weight at 3-5 pounds, and usually do not have a handle on them...so those are NOT...at all easily portable and more of a burden trying to move them around. Whereas this one...solves that problem completely.As for feel its extremely comfortable. It feels like sitting on a cloud compared to the hard floor, or my hard walker seat. Surprisingly comfortable for how light it is and yet gives you enough cushioning and I feel totally comfortable sitting and kneeling on it. In sum, if you want one of the lightest, but yet most comfortable and most portable seat cushions...get this cushion.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this cushion for a new ergonomic office chair I felt was quite comfortable except for its only 'relatively comfortable' seat cushion. (note: the product page showed this cushion on an ergonomic office chair)Unfortunately, this 3\" cushion turned a comfortable ergonomic office chair into a decidedly uncomfortable experience by changing the dynamics and ergonomics of the chair itself. The lumbar and back support didn't feel right at all with the addition of the thicker cushion. (I should have seen that coming).The cushion itself arrived folded and rolled inside a protective sleeve and plastic bag. Once laid out, it took quite a few hours for the dense foam to achieve a flat surface again without a hump in the middle. But once it did, its breathable cover fit snuggly and is attractive.The double stitched handle is a real plus. And is real handy for a 'grab and go cushion' for those games on bleachers.Although the surface material and substrata breathe, the dense foam feels warm to me after sitting for a while. And, I don't like sitting on the surface material in shorts as it feels a bit scratchy. My partner found himself adjusting his clothes several times before getting more comfortable because the material pulled at his clothes as he sunk in.That said, the cushion is very comfortable on flat, or only slightly padded surfaces.CONCLUSION: I'm happy with the cushion, but not for the intended purpose. It will be good on meditation retreats, bleachers, the front bench, or sitting in a straight back chair working on a project for hours. And I have a short friend that can use it to elevate herself at the table when she visits for a more comfortable game of cards.",

                "reviewText": "This pad was ordered as a gift for my sister who is in a wheelchair when she's not in her bed. She needed a new pad and this fit perfectly. There are different sizes of wheelchair, so be careful. This won't work for a small chair, so look for a different size if that's what you need.The pad is very soft and the foam returns to shape quickly.",
