This seat cushion has reduced my discomfort tremendously. I can definately feel the difference & I'm even thinking of buying another one for my car.I also took it with me to use on a12hr flight. I can say it made a huge difference. Love it as it distributes weight evenly and minimized the discomfort of plane seats. It is a lil bulky and heavy (you might consider the lighter version for shorter travel) but it's fine if you are using it in an office chair or anywhere stationary & it does have handles for easy carry if like me you are traveling with it.I was hesitant to buy at first because of the price tag but it's proven to do what it says & I'm hoping the price and brand signal durability.-I haven't experienced the sliding of the cushion like other reviews mention.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATED: like with anything in life patience is a virtue with this wonder. As badly as I bashed the product here I am months later to sit down, have that plate of crow and like it. This item does help tremendously for long sitting. I can say without a doubt bad posture will make this item feel like a standard chair pillow. With good posture, you are literally sitting good, comfortable and pretty (handsome for men). Anyways. The gel is amazing with the right posture. It doesn't have signs of wear or whatever gel looks like with cheap quality. When I have overnight stays I take this baby with me. When is switch rooms. Guess what? This baby comes with me. You will not t go wrong in investing in this priority seat cushion. Give your posterior a daily massage.-Pros; wonder purple gel, improve posture, durable, breathable and portable-Cons: little pricey (that's all I got, really-apologies: Purple I left my original review just so you can see patience really is a virtue with this item. Take your tOne, Amazon's return policy give you a great cushion to try out the device. Really follow the posture rule of thumb.Besides the item being overpriced for what is essentially wonder gel. The egg test doesn't prove it's soft because the egg doesn't sit for hours in it. It isn't what is adveriesed when the basic memory foam offered for way less in the categories offer better cushion (I own one still). The scale in which they justify quality isn't accurate because for $80 dollars you get a basic cushion from Office Depot. My guess is the casual lax version which is in the hundreds is probably the above average cushion support that should be purchased. Don't trust the scam of the egg. Again. Eggs don't sit for hours at a time if they did they would crack. I do not recommend this price point product at all. The customer service response? \"Adjust monitor height\" that's what I was told. What does that have to do with my bottom?? Zero. Do I need to say it again. The eggs doesn't have to sit down.Cost: ridiculous for basically wonder gel. That's all. Just gel with waves.Final verdict: should be an infomercial or \"as seen on TV\" because it a low grade seat cushion for a high dollar price. Can't wait to get my money back for this near scam of wording. Don't believe the hype and keep your money AND EGGS. This company doesn't care about how much overprice an avg cushion. Remember their customer service response again \"oh well just return it\". Nice",

                "reviewText": "Guys. My butt is so happy. I'm not joking, I legitimately bought four different cushions to try to make sitting at my desk for hours on end less uncomfortable. I tried the Comfilife cushion that has awesome reviews, plus a wedge-shaped cushion and a cushion/back support combo. The Comfi-Life came close, but for me it still wasn't quite right. While it was made of memory foam, it was extremely firm. The tailbone support idea is nice in theory, and I can see how the cutout in the back would work well for someone with significant pain issues. At 5'1 and about 115 lbs, the Comfi-life wasn't right. It elevated me too much, and the cushion was so firm that the cutout in the back was very obvious. While it was a step up from no cushion at all, I did have to reposition myself frequently to stay comfortable, even after just a few minutes.The Royal cushion by Purple was a totally different feel. While it has enough structure to support you, the rubber itself is soft. Unlike the Comfi-life, it doesn't matter how you sit on it. It's comfortable in any position, not too soft, not too hard, and very supportive. Mine came in perfect condition, and the cover fits perfectly. I do wish they had replacement covers in different materials and colors so you could match it with your decor. If you're in an office with a typical black desk chair, it probably doesn't matter. My mini home office is in my bedroom, so I try to make it look as nice as I can.I paired the cushion with the Coop lumbar support pillow and a foam foot rest, and for me that was the perfect combination. While the other seat cushions weren't bad products, I think their comfort level depended on your height and weight. I would guess that the Purple cushion would work well for almost any body type. Before you buy it, do measure the chair you're going to use it in and compare it with the dimensions of different models. I can't attest to their customer service, but I love Purple's product.",
