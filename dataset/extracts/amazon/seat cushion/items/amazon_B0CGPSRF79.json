I really appreciate the larger 18\" width. The sewn-on carry handle is handy for transporting to another chair, automobile, stadiums, etc.The contour molding of the cushion was not very noticeable to me. I'm pretty sure it didn't improve my posture.I work at my desk for several hours a day and this cushion has proven to be an excellent performer. I am very pleased with it. Recommended.",
