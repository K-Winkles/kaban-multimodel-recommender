                "reviewText": "I really like this cushion. I didn't buy this to sit on (although I have and it's very comfy). I'm using it for two other purposes. I initially bought it to use with a machine I use for my back pain, in which you have to hang your bent legs over it, with behind the knees being the contact spot, but it gets painful and also, they slip. This solved both of those problems. It gives fantastic cushioning and stays put. I have also discovered that if I'm laying on my stomach with a heating pad on my back, well... that position, for anyone with lower back pain, gets very painful very quickly, but I found that if I put this cushion under my hip area, it's the perfect height to get that tension off of my lower back, and so comfortable that you don't even remember that it's there. So yeah... I'm very, very happy with this purchase. One thing I will say though, is that this cushion is probably not the best to take with you on the go, because it's quite weighty for that purpose. To sum it up, it's well made, great support and very handy, at a great price point, but a bit weighty for on the go. Thanks for reading my review.",
