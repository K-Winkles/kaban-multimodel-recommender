I used both to change feet position as my feet swell sooo bad. The foot pad is great it is like a messager as well. I rubbed my feet back and forth on it with my c-socks. I will never fly without this again. Wish they made a bag to fit their seat cushion and foot pad to carry on plane. Both are life savers. Great, amazing quality!",

It's very cozy, especially in the morning.I like that it doesn't slide around on the floor. It took a couple tries to get it in the right spot under my desk but once I got it in place I knew it. I could feel the alignment fall into place and I know that it won't drift away from me through the day.It also shipped really REALLY fast if thats important to you.Things I'd like: I'd rather it had an ivory color option and I wish it were a bit more firm. But it does solve the ergonomic issue for my home office desk and for that reason I recommend it.",
