Like trying to side on a paint bucket, you'll be sagging over both sides. Not comfortable for tubbies like me, but great for everyone else.",

                "reviewText": "I got two of these after reading the reviews since I\u2019ve been dealing with some bad sciatica recently. Pillows like this truly are expensive! I have one on my desk chair for working during the day, and one in my car. It\u2019s been 2 weeks or so of use, not daily but most days, and most of my pain is gone. I\u2019m almost hesitant to say that because when people say that in reviews, it\u2019s usually too good to be true. And maybe I\u2019ll jinx it! But I think taking the pressure off my tailbone was really instrumental to healing this pain. I\u2019m a heavier person so the cushions seem to \u201csquish\u201d down thin fairly easily, but so far it hasn\u2019t affected the comfort yet. (They don\u2019t seem permanently squished/thinner.) And actually this is probably better for my car, since I drive a Camry and it would be too uncomfortable to be lifted up higher with a thicker cushion. When I get into the car in these cold winter temps, the cushion is almost hard from the cold but it softens quickly after you sit. It does block the heat from the seat heater but the heat in my lower back and relief from tailbone pain/sciatica is worth it. It\u2019s relatively wide too (more than other cushions I\u2019ve nearly bought) so that\u2019s a plus too.",

He left it on the chair when he went home do I say on it \u2026. Well all I can say is game changer !!! I have tried other chair cushions that just did not cut it. I love my Windsor chairs they are beautiful but hard on the back side.. my chairs are black do I ordered the black they look nice hardly noticeable. Now when we sit at table for long card games or meals we are all very comfortable.. I highly recommend oh and I need to mention that they stay in place and the covers are washable \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

It bounces right back to its original shape when you\u2019re not sitting on it which is what it should be doing. Myself and my husband both have issues with herniated discs and sciatica\u2026 My husband\u2018s more chronic than my own. This worked perfectly for me on my dining room chairs, and in my car\u2026 For my husband, it was too uncomfortable, but again his disk issues are quite severe as he\u2019s had more than one ablation and a disc replacement. I would suggest try it \u2026 it may work for you. I am very happy with it, and extremely glad that I decided to buy these. Now I have one for my car and for my dining room.",
