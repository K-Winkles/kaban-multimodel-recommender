                "reviewText": "The chair I have in my office is a piece of **** it was fine for a few months and in a year it was incredibly uncomfortable and even painful to sit on. But I got laid off not too long ago so getting a new chair is unfortunately not a priority. So I did some research on sitting pillows and came across this oneAnd wow the difference was immediate.My chair is so bad that sitting on it was doing damage, it was hard to stand up out of it, it would make my butt numb, and my tailbone ache and tingle. Whenever I stood up I had to do that cliche hands on my back stretch to straighten back out to stand upright. My back was hurting in ways it never did before and my neck pain was getting worse, I work from home and other than going to the gym my hobbies also include me being at a desk so I spend a lot of time in the chair (10-15 hours)I got this pillow and gave it a go, 24hours later I felt way better, my back pain started going away, my neck pain dulled to where it\u2019s supposed to be, and I was able to stand up out of my chair again. I love this thing, I very much still need a new chair but for now this is a cheaper alternative that\u2019s working greatIt\u2019s comfortable too which is a bonus, I only have 1 minor complaint and 1 is more of a suggestionMy complaint is the rough mesh material, if you sit on it without pants on it\u2019s really scratchy, so I always feel it\u2019s necessary now to put my shorts on before I sit down. Not sure what id replace it with though since it is pretty durable material.Suggestion: get sticky Velcro strips that you can cut and place on the pillow and your chair, the pillow doesn\u2019t slide around when I\u2019m sitting, but whenever I get up it shifts and sitting back down I have to sort of grab it and adjust while I\u2019m sitting so it\u2019s in the right spot since my chair has the little winglets on the seat edge",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these for the front seats of my Mercedes C63S. It\u2019s a V-8 with a great ride, but it tends to have a little too much vibration which sports cars are known for. I was hesitant to buy the car because I knew it was going to be an issue for my butt and back, but I really wanted to see if I could fix the problem and still have the car of my dreams! I tried several cushions and they all helped, but this one was the best of all of them. It\u2019s a great shock absorber and very comfortable to sit on. I purchased the larger size and it fits the car seat well. It doesn\u2019t slip around or twist when I get in and out of the car. I got 2 because sometimes, I\u2019m the passenger as my husband loves to drive the car too! I\u2019m very happy with the quality of the cushion and would recommend it to anyone who has coccyx and back pain and can\u2019t take the vibration of a car. I hope this review helps others looking for a solution for comfort in a car - try it, it works!",

                "reviewText": "I received a new pillow today and put it on my mesh office chair. At first glance, I liked its shape. However, two things immediately caught my attention. Firstly, the pillow is quite big for my backside, but it compresses significantly once you sit on it. Secondly, it is not very firm, but it does have a nice cushioning effect of about 1 inch once sat on. It is less firm than a medical pillow. I will keep you all updated on my experience using it at work over the next week or so, and share my conclusion. As of now, I think it would be better to look for something that provides more firmness and cushioning if you want real support.",

Its firm enough to keep its shape; but feels cushiony when you have sit on it for long periods and is still comfortable after a full work day. It has a hole in the pillow just in the center in the place where you need it for air flow. It has a little tab a lower back that adds another bit of comfort that I have not seen in other pillows. I don't mind giving critical reviews for improvement...and I love giving great reviews when I believe that they are warranted. I know its just a pillow but its a happy positive game changer for me. 100% Will be buying more.",

                "reviewText": "I was pretty excited when this arrived, and it was at such a good price. I sit 10 to 12 hours a day for work and my bottom was getting very sore. I thought this may do the trick. Within the first 2 days the cushion had permanently flattened to about 2 inches thick and it does not come back to full thickness. It has a very good non-slip backing, which I do like. I am returning because it is no better or worse than sitting on my thinly padded game chair that I use for an office chair. I guess the search continues.----> UPDATE<---- So, the company reached out to me and addressed my issue REALLY FAST and their CUSTOMER SERVICE IS 5 STAR! They replaced my cushion with an updated model that is slightly thicker, but not thick enough for 12 hour workday sitting for me. With that said, the material is very nice and stays very cool. I do not get hot sitting on the material. The non-slip bottom is the best I have ever seen. The dimensions are perfect and the cushion completely covers the seat of my chair. The cushion does return to it's original shape after sitting all night and in the morning until about 1pm or 2pm it does its job. That is the first 6 hours of my day. The last 6 hours of my day I need to put a pillow on top of it. I think with a little improvement, this product can be the best on the market.",

One cushion eliminated the need to replace a chair whose seat sank to a new low. I have tried gel seats, but none of them came close to the relief from this product.",

Man sitzt wie auf Watte gebettet, sehr sehr angenehm und hat das Gef\u00fchl die Schmerzen seien wie weggeblasen!M\u00f6chte es von daher nicht mehr missen und wird nicht mein letztes Kissen dieser Art gewesen sein!Klare Kaufempfehlung!!!",
