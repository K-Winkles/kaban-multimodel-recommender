                "reviewText": "When I sat on the cushion it flattened down to less than half an inch which provided the same amount of support as a soft pillow and not the specific amount of support in specific areas that one expects from a product made to alleviate pressure on the tail bone etc... since no matter how you sit on it the support is everywhere just like it would be if you weren't using this cushion at all.Other reviews seem to be complaining about this item being too stiff. I wish that was the case. I would have been happy with that. I assume that they are selling very different cushions under this same listing? So it is hard to know what to expect.I'll add that I am not particularly over weight. I'm about 190 pounds and over 6 feet tall. I can actually squeeze the cushion down to half an inch using just two fingers and not really trying. I expect even a child would have the same difficulty with this product.",
