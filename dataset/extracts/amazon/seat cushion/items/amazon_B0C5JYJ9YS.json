Other pads were simply too small for a 6' 300 pound man.Second nice thing here is the cover that comes with it. One side is light and vented, a silky smooth. The other side is covered with little rubber speckles. The rubber dots SEEM like a massage texture thing, BUT ITS NOT. Nope, flip it over and you find they grip chairs amazingly well so the pad stays put when you get up/down from your chair. I've seen covers with straps and other awkward velcro patchs... but this is perfect.Highly reccomend.",

I found they just squashed down to about \u00bc inch. There is nothing to keep the air in the cells. I switched back to my regular foam cushion and stopped using this gel seat cushion.\u2022 The gel cushion includes a textured-black bottom cover that can be washed. If you are not satisfied, they claim they will provide a full refund!\u2022 Vine review products are sent to me without paying Amazon for it. Everything I get is reported as income to me, so I will have to pay income taxes on the list price. I pay for them, just not to Amazon. I may actually lose on the deal.",

                "reviewText": "I had gotten the \"green\" cushion. Unfortunately, it wasn't BIG enough to cover a typical Honda seat.Don't get my wrong there's just enough space for the Green one to work well and it is thinner than the largest one so it's soft to sit on.I did have an issue with the size of it. I needed larger as I'm sat in my car for 10 hours plus a day. The seller reached out to me and help rectify MY ISSUE in record time.With that being said I highly recommend getting the LARGEST one that the seller offers.Also as a side note: because the largest one is actually THICKER as well... The largest one is not as soft. I am fine with that as it's more about needing support at pressure points. So keep in mind when some of these reviews say \"it's hard to sit on\", well yeah the largest unit is also thicker therefore causing the cushion to feel harder. Don't confuse more SUPPORT for the unit being harder. It's just the dynamics of a thicker supporting honeycomb grid.Definitely get these as the seller alone is worth the price of admission. Again I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the largest (blue) one for the car. The green one works very well for an office chair.",
