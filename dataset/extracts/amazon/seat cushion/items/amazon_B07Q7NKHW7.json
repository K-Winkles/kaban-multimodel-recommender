Recently I had sciatica and the pain on the back on my leg was not conducive to sitting on my usual chair. I remember seeing a similar pad advertized on TV so I looked on Amazon and came up with this chair pad to ease my pain. It works, making sitting on my old hard chair a more comfortable experience by taking the pressure off the back of my leg. I also like the fact that the pad is encased in a zippered cover, making it easy to keep clean.",
