It's a lifesaver for those purposes, but it has a few design flaws. I considered buying an Oregon Aero seat cushion with the added lumbar support ($250 total and long wait for delivery) but chose this one because of the price.Likes:Very comfortable for sitting long periods of time. Durable so far. The cushion hasn't broken down at all over the past 6 months of use.Dislikes:A bit too thick. Slippery cover causes the cushion to slide around on seat, especially leather seats. It feels like sitting on a wood plank in cold weather (below 50 degrees F), so if you leave it in a cold car overnight, you won't like it in the morning. A built-in lumbar support (like the Oregon Aero product) would be nice also.",

This is the best chair cushion ever! I couldn\u2019t sit for more than an hour or two without pain. With this 8 hours is no problem",

                "reviewText": "I can tell by the feel that it is a good material and can be comfortable, but it's too small for a large frame person to really gain relief out of it. As with all small sized cushions the side will dig into your thighs and legs. My butt does kind of feel nice.Maybe if you were a child you could fully enjoy this size, but for something that costs almost $100 I'm really disappointed. For something that cost that much they could have at least made it full sized.Update: Gave it a bit more time. Yeah, too small length and width wise. Hurts like hell.",
