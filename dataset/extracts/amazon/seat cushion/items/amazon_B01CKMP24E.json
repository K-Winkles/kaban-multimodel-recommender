                "reviewText": "ok in short summary: feels firm but is soft enough to sit on an egg and not crack the egg surprisingly. 1.25\" thick, supports my 225lb weight, after long sitting perioids in car and office playing games and doing i.t. work, i haven't had tailbone or coccyx strain/pain. and its not heat producing. hav sat in chairs or cushions that trap and generate heat after while.so more in depth thoughts and blabber:i love this cushion more than other cushions. most are foam. but its not hot it breathes. I tried sitting on an egg even tho this is 1.25\" not the 2inch and the egg didn't crack. i did it slowly carefully but leaned back and raised my arms and legs to make sure my weight was on my buttocks and this thing is soft enough to conform to the pressure of an egg without cracking it. I'm 5' 6\" / 7\" and a bit hefty at 225lbs. so i'm not a light weight. granted the egg was in my butt crack which has a ... well crack or space to give, but i tried same thing with egg on a normal couch recliner chair with egg in a sandwhich baggy and that egg cracked and exploded.I slept on this as well just to see. i like firmer and fuller pillows , i'm a side sleeper , and threw this on top of a very thin pillow. its actually firm probably too firm for most people's heads my head didn't sink. this is very supportive of a lot of weight.I sat on this in my car and my office chair and i can tell i'm physically sitting higher like my knees almost hit bottom of my steering wheel in car and i definitely sit a lil higher. so this cushions and raises your body a good inch or so. but soft enough to site on an egg carefully without having issue.I would say its safe to assume if you're lighter in weight the 1\" or thinner might support your body. i'm 225lbs and this 1 & quarter\" thick supports my sitting weight fine.My office chair and sometimes in my car i get that Tailbone/Coccyx strain and pain. so this cushion , for me, is for providing long term sitting cushion and comfort and relive pressure and pain for me. i do I.T. work and sometimes work on my computer remotely all day, shop all day, and play games ... all in one day so this last week this thing has had a lot of use for one week.I did stretch this thing out and grabbing the ends and pulling apart, this thing stretches good. the material is like a firm jelly material. doesn't feel like typical anything really. but i've enjoyed it.i think this thing doesn't feel as soft as it is but it supports nicely and cushiony enough but feels a lil firm but so far haven't had that pain in my coccyx so i'm happy so far so good and its not hot. i live in houston its like 85-95 but feels like 95-105 with 200% humidity so i didn't want a cushion you feel as being hot and didn't want something that goes flat but can support me since i'm a bit over weight actually and i sit a lot. but no pain in the butt after long sitting period is a double!",

                "reviewText": "I have a broken tailbone, and not much helps it. Saw this, thought I'd give it a try.First of all, there is a disclaimer about how it might be damaged if used while at a high temperature, which is where it would be if left in the car during a hot summer day. That was kinda my plan. I will say it hasn't been damaged, but its cooler now and hasn't been through more than a handful of hot days.Without the cushion I might last 1-2 hours before I have to just get out and walk around. I will say that although I didn't expect this to be perfect, I can go 2-4 hours on it before I need a break. It does work and provides comfort and support. Doesn't slide around in the seat when I get in and out as well.All in all, a good purchase. I'm betting most of you will have better comfort than I, but I'm doomed to not ever be 100% comfortable on it.",

                "reviewText": "I tried a different highly rated butt cushion first. It was thicker and probably better for those that need more support. However it wasn\u2019t ideal me. It was so thick every time I sat down on it i\u2019d jump up thinking I wasn\u2019t sitting in my chair right.That\u2019s what brought me here. I\u2019ve purchased Purple products in the past and most worked out well. I took a chance on this. It\u2019s just thick enough for what I need but no much I feel like I\u2019m up on top of something. Plus this is a little wider too. Which I like. I use it on my office chair and work from home so it sees A LOT of use.The one issue I had was, even with the gripper bottom, it slides forward on the seat. But I connected a short bungee cord between the pillow handles around the back of my chair. Problem solved.",
