Without proper cushioning, that discomfort becomes increasingly agitated. Adding a chair pad to your office accessories lineup can help take the pressure off your lower body. The added ventilation holes and breathable mesh cover allow you to sit cool and comfortable. Benefits of gel memory foam? Memory foam uses your body heat to adapt and contour to fit your precise shape. A gel memory foam chair cushion takes into account the amount of weight applied and provides support where you need it most. This customized fit reduces pain and facilitates faster recovery times from lower body injuries. Added ventilation holes in the seat cushion allows body heat to escape, so you can continue to work, game, or study without worry of overheating. Will it help my back pain? Unsupportive chairs are detrimental to your back health as they put excess pressure on your spine and lead to poor sitting posture. Using an office chair seat cushion while sitting for long stretches helps to reduce compression in the spine for better alignment and pain relief. Will it help tailbone fatigue? A chair that lacks the proper support can lead to poor posture while sitting, creating excess pressure on your back, tailbone, and hips. Adding an ergonomic office seat cushion is a simple way to upgrade your chair to make it more comfortable and supportive. How to wash the seat cushion? We made it easy to keep your desk chair cushion fresh. Simply unzip the cover and pull away from gel memory foam. Toss the cover into the wash on the gentle cycle with cold water. Tumble dry on low or no heat. Do not wash the memory foam.",

                "reviewText": "After reading A LOT of reviews and part descriptions, I landed on this pad and I\u2019m glad I did. This was technically built for wheelchair seats, I believe, but this has been the best office chair pad I\u2019ve owned to date.I\u2019d bought a new monitor setup that raised my monitors higher than I prefer them and my chair is already at highest adjustment, so I was specifically looking for a pad that would also boost me up a little bit.5-6 months in, this pad has been perfect for my needs. It sits me a little higher, Its comfortable, it hasn\u2019t flattened at all yet. Someone even borrowed my chair one day while while I was out and asked me all about this pad when I got back. They wanted to know where I got it & how much because when they sat in my seat they were surprised by how comfy it was (in our office everyone has to use the same standard office chair, so pads like these are essential)..I don\u2019t foresee this wearing out too quickly. It seems like a quality product. I highly recommend this pad. Def worth the comfort if you sit at a desk for long hours.",

The chair is more comfortable, the chair has held up better, as has this cushion.",

I got this because I wanted something softer with more cushion after trying it at my mom's. Well I only started using this a couple days ago but already I am messed up with pain. Last night my sciatica was so severe I couldn't walk. However, my mother who has severe back pain uses this and loves it so maybe it's a me issue. It is incredibly soft and comfortable but unfortunately I will have to return it and go back to my firm cushion with the divet. Maybe if you don't sit a lot it won't make a difference, not really sure why this caused problems for me.",
