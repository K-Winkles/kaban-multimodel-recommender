                "reviewText": "A number of years ago, I broke my tailbone in a fall. As I've aged, it has deviated some and sitting for very long, it can become irritated and painful. I decided to try this cushion to alleviate that soreness. It does work well, relieving the pressure on my tailbone when sitting. It does not give as much as some memory foam but that is good for this purpose as it doesn't squish down to the point of not helping. I had hoped it would work in bed, as sleeping on my back can also be uncomfortable but it is too firm for that purpose. I've tried another, very soft U-cushion but I am unable to adjust to having something under me when I sleep. If you need a cushion to relieve pressure around your tailbone/anal area, at a reasonable price, I will say I think this one does that job fine.",

                "reviewText": "After my house flooded from a hurricane, I had to buy a new desk chair but the chair I bought barely had any cushioning. After a week of use, it had no padding at all. I bought this cushion to use on it and it has been great. It fits almost perfectly and I no longer hurt after sitting at the computer for long periods of time. I like that it has a removable cover that you can wash.",
