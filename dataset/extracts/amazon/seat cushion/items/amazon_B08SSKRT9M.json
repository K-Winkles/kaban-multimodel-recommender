It helped me to recover from sciatica, raising the height of the chair and cushioning my thigh muscle. I would buy this product again, possibly one for home.",

                "reviewText": "Premise: my almost 4 year old leather office chair is at the end of its life and the seat has pretty much lost its cushion (i.e. it's flat). In order to make do with my chair I needed to find an actual good seat cushion instead of the pillow I've been using.I've bought many of these memory foam seat cushions from Amazon and had to return all of them because they were either too firm, too small, had weird designs, and just didn't match the contours of my big office chair; those ones clearly had other purposes to them (i.e. designed for medical issues with the spine or something). This, however, was not one of them.This one's noticeably on the softer side, yet it does not sink down and compress to your weight. Soft yet bouncy is what I'd describe the feeling, which is perfect in emulating the soft bouncy/springy cushioning of some high-end office chairs (e.g. Serta Hensley).Not only that, but this cushion is the only one that conforms perfectly to the shape and size of my seat. The rounded contours at the back and sloped front really helps make it the perfect seat cushion for office chairs (and definitely for gaming chairs as well).Everyone has their own specific needs, but if you're like me: just a regular guy who needs to find a more comfier seat cushion for their big and tall office chair (or gaming chairs), than this cushion is the one. I'd highly recommend this one.",
