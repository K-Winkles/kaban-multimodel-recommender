                "reviewText": "It was hard to find a decently priced cushion that didn't have the tailbone cutout (I had tried that type previously and it wasn't for me). I really like this cushion - it's a good thickness and decent size. It does slightly slope towards the front of the chair, which I realized after a few weeks when I couldn't figure out why I kept sliding off the chair. I reversed the cushion and it solved the issue. It does appear to be memory foam, which means it's a bit firm when you initially sit down (and I was at first wondering if I would be sending it back), but it provides great support and comfort. I rated it 4 stars because of the sloping style and that I'd like it to be a few inches wider.",

They spend most of their time in their recliners and they complain that their bottoms get sore from sitting long periods. After reading the reviews I decided to order this cushion for each of them. Both are very happy with them. Haven't had them long enough to report how they will hold up but visually the quality seems good. The price was affordable for the quality. I would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I bought an office chair in the pandemic, and although it's structurally pretty solid, the seat padding was completely flattened after about a year of eight hour days. So, I bought one of these, thinking that if it lasted a few months, I'd be happy with it.That was summer 2021. I just realised I've had this thing for two and a half years, and it's still in almost mint condition - the cover is still perfect, and the padding just pops back up, even though it's been in extended daily use for that entire period. It's honestly lasted ten times as long as I was expecting, and shows no obvious signs of deterioration.I probably should have reviewed it sooner, but it's always difficult with something like this as you don't know how well it will last - well, now I know, and I have to give it five stars. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat... but I obviously don't need to.",
