It stays comfortable and honestly, it seems to be a little more comfortable when you sink into it and you get more side support.I think it's a good purchase if your backside fits it.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I read the other reviews on here and thought I'm not THAT wide, I should fit fine. Nope.I am familiar with the \"original\" sculpted office seat cushion marketed around lately, but have not test driven it, so I can't really compare this one to that. I will say, pay attention to the other reviews on here and mine when I say you need to be a certain size for this to fit you properly and with comfort. I'm a size 12 in women's clothing, and this just felt uncomfortable, and it fell flat - no support. I will say the material covering the cushion and its construction appears to be of quality and well made.",

                "reviewText": "This donut cushion is quite comfortable.It does a good job relieving tailbone pain I would get from setting in hard seats that had no cushion. My buttocks sometimes would get kind of numb for having to sit for a few hours while getting my hair braided.I will be bringing this the next time I set up an appointment.The foam still has its shape.It didn\u2019t flatten out like most memory foam products I tested do.The honeycomb fabric doesn\u2019t feel rough.The anti slip base kept the cushion in place when I sat in my office chair \ud83e\ude91.I never noticed an unpleasant smell when it came fresh out the box.The cover can be removed and washed once it gets dirty or gain any smell.I really can\u2019t think of any complaints besides mines having minor stitching \ud83e\uddf5 issues with the honeycomb mesh.",
