I'm pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and durable they are for the price I paid. I bought the 6 pack and plan to buy more in case they stop making this product. I have old back injuries from being in the military, and these cushions make sitting at the dining room table much more comfortable for my back!",

                "reviewText": "I did a fair amount of research while looking for the most comfortable inexpensive kitchen chair covers. I finally decided on the Sweet Home Collection chair cushions and purchased an order for a six pack of them. They were delivered promptly and in good shape. We used them for a family lunch and everyone thought that they were fairly comfortable and definitely better than just the hard wood surface. They are not super thick but really do provide some comfort. I wanted to try this type as I have purchased the puffy covers with ties in the past and have found that those tend to bunch up, pack down and the ties are ripped off in no time. These pads have a rubber backing that is supposed to prevent them from sliding. So.. they do slide on the chair easily when you are not sitting on the chair but they do stay in place well while you are sitting on them. I think they could improve the no slide part a bit better and I don't know how well the backing will hold up if you wash them very often. I do like that they say they are machine washable. It was a doable fix for our family without having to spend a lot and we are happy with them. I would purchase this item again.",

                "reviewText": "I needed black and white checked chair pad to complete my holiday decor scheme and I am delighted with these! I found more expensive ones locally but they had lumpy stuffing and no piping. These are the perfect size for my black Windsor chairs. The plaid is straight, stitching even and sturdy, and the piping is the perfect finishing touch. The solid piece of memory foam makes for a very comfortable, firm, and smooth seat. I was a bit apprehensive that with the fit of the pads and no ties, they would slide off the chairs, but the reverse surface of the cushion is non-slip and perfect. Also, the price and delivery time could not be beat!",
