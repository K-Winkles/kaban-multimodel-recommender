                "reviewText": "After almost two weeks of daily 8-hour use (with frequent breaks):Pros: The comfort of this seat is superb. I bought it to augment the failing padding of a 10-year-old cheap office chair, and it accomplishes that goal quite well. The memory foam is resilient and comes completely back up after a quick break. The soft padding is comfortable and I like how it is removable for washing. I do think that it has improved my posture tremendously.Cons: However, the memory foam compresses about 50% after about an hour of use. Of course memory foam is expected to compress, but this seems like a lot to me. In addition, the two back \"arms\" of the seat tend to flare out to the sides after compressing, which results in a wider tailbone hole than usual and causes a loss of support for a small person. I had to resort to tying a rope around mine to try and keep it together. I wish the manufacturer had sewn that handle across the tailbone cutout instead of on the side to keep it together.Verdict: I would buy it again. One million times better than my old threadbare chair and a great value.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised when I got this today for several reasons:One-there was no sort of indication of the company selling this pillow: No \u201cplease buy our stuff\u201d or any directions-not saying they need them but I seriously thought there would be something in the package. That was weird.Two-there\u2019s no emblem on the pillow like shown in the advertisement pictures. This is my own fault because I didn\u2019t look at any of the picture reviews. If I had, I would have saw that others have a plain black pillow cushion. However, I don\u2019t get why they have all the pictures of the product having a dark green emblem but don\u2019t send that product. Again: my mistake. Weird still.and for the most disappointing:Three-It\u2019s not awesome. I have recently started having serious coccyx, hip, and low back pain and sitting in our wooden chairs for more than 30 minutes was TORTURE for me. It would essential leave me stuck in the sitting position for about 10 seconds while waiting for my pain and stiffness to let up. I used a regular chair cushion, but it didn\u2019t really help. I chose this cushion because it wasn\u2019t too expensive and because the reviews were decent. This morning I saw it was on the way to me and I was thrilled that my butt hurt so I could test it out!!! My heart was as deflated as this pillow becomes after my sitting on it. It shifts all over the chair in spite of the grippers on the bottom of the cushion. It isn\u2019t long enough to cover from front to the edge of the seat. It isn\u2019t the actual size of a seat. It\u2019s just like a little neck pillow of some kind but for the booty\u2026..that tells you how little your booty needs to be for this to be 5 stars. I noticed if I shift it closer to the back so it actually supports my big butt and hips, it feels like I have a wretched wedgie from what I assume is a seated posture trainer. It really isn\u2019t comfortable for me at all.Good thing 1-3: It is price efficient for my broke, hurting arthritic butt. It didn\u2019t smell weird. It\u2019s light weight.",

I struggle with sciatic nerve pain, so it's important to me to have good sitting posture, and I was hoping this cushion would help. It does help. I wouldn't say it's incredible or that it's \"cured\" my pain, but it's definitely better than nothing. It is as advertised. I've only had it for a few weeks now, so I can't say whether it retains its shape over time, but so far it seems to be holding up.",
