                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My Comfy Office Chair Cushion is at Last at an End !",
                "reviewText": "The foam cushion I have used for 3 years is finally worn out completely so my quest began. I ordered a gel office seat that was hyped up during Amazon Prime day on promotion, the thing was like sitting on a rock! It GAVE butt ache. Next, I tried an intermediate cushion, some gel some foam - blah, and too thin, I could feel the chair and found myself standing rather than sitting just so as not to be on it. Now this one arrived today and I feel like Goldilocks, it's just right.The Pros: soft enough to sit on that does not make you sore, helps me in sitting up straighter without feeling like I'm \"perching\" on it, fits my office chair perfectly ( mines a usual size regular office-type bought at Staples) better than the gel one with the \"cut out\" U shape that made me feel I could spill over the sides if not centered right. I Have sat on a \"purple\" one at a store as I considered a \"purple\" but too expensive, and to my mind, this is every bit as good without the hefty price, in fact, it's better because it doesn't have that weird wobble I thought the purple one had. Maybe that's down to it having a cover (the store sample \"purple\" did not have a cover on). It does not squish down and I don't think it will, and for me, it's a keeper. The Cons: The box it arrived in had clearly been opened and I suspect someone else had returned it, came with no paperwork, cover already on ( maybe that's standard? for other two cushions the cover had come as separate in the box for me to insert and zip). But it doesn't matter if it's a \"return\" from someone else because quality is fine and I'm not returning. Another reviewer mentioned the smell and because I had read about it I smelled it - yes, it does have a chemical smell. But only if you put it up to your face, I'm sitting on it now and can't smell in usual use. Anyway, likely to wear off in time. I don't particularly like the feel of the ( cheap material) cover, so thin - on the other hand, same as the other cushions covers were, anyway I have wrapped it in a comfy small fleece blanket that the dog isn't using in his bed ( !) and this means it feels soft to sit on. Maybe that will affect the \"cooling\" that it's supposed to create through the eggbox airholes, but I didn't care about that feature, my office is cool, and needing air circulation in my cushion just isn't important to me - I wanted the support and comfort. I have sat on it for several hours today writing a long document and like it so much I will probably get some more for our kitchen chairs now we spend much longer around the family dinner table ( what with all the gourmet cooking we learned during COVID and better meals with appetizers etc that my fam. now regard as standard!). I Will update this review if doesn't hold up but my last one (a weak bit of foam bought on a whim in fabric store sale) was good enough for several years so I'm hoping it will provide years of comfort.For the price and the product, I wouldn't hesitate. It also says something that I came on and wrote a review because normally I don't bother unless particularly impressed or disappointed and I order quite a bit on Amazon ( not a paid reviewer or employee or anything).Good luck with finding the perfect one for you, I hope my views help with your decision, even though it's not an overly expensive item comfort can make a big difference to your office day so it's important to get it as right as you can.",

                "reviewText": "I have hypermobile joints and work long hours at my desk. The compacted foam in my vintage chair made my lower back (spine), hips and knees hurt after sitting for about 15 minutes. I'm glad I gave this type of seat cushion a try! It's not the softest, butg that's what I was looking for- not super squishy memory foam. It's pretty supportive while also quite squishy. The size is great. The cover is on the flimsy side, and it does not keep the cushion from slipping around at all. The somewhat disappointing cover, and the fact that I paid a little extra to have a green cushion but was sent a sky blue one = four stars",

I can\u2019t give it as a present in that condition and I\u2019m afraid to order another one. It\u2019s too much trouble to return it so I\u2019m keeping it as a spare (after I sanitize it).
