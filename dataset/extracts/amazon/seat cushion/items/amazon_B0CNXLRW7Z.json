                "reviewText": "I like that it\u2019s a great travel size. When packing, I don\u2019t want to deal with bulky items. When I go to conventions, the chairs provided by the facility are hard plastic and I often sit at the edge so it hurts my butt bones. I\u2019m small enough where my bones can fit onto the cushion when folded which is great if I want twice the cushion. When unfolded, it covers the center and edge of the chair so I can sit anywhere on it. The whole thing is breathable from the outer cloth material to the \u201cwaffle\u201d gel on the inside. The gel on the inside can be removed for cleaning everything. The elastic strap is also great for keeping the cushion folded. It\u2019s great for my needs.I\u2019m small so this cushion fits and can withstand my weight fine for a couple days out of the year, but I\u2019m not sure how this stands up to people who use it every day and/or weigh much more than me. I also can\u2019t speak for those who actually have pains when sitting regularly. My problem is just a light comfort issue that would resolve itself within a day or two. I\u2019ve tried things like the purple mattress company\u2019s seat cushions and I wiggle on it because I\u2019m too light, but larger people might benefit more from it than I would.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this cushion folds up, has a strap to keep it closed, a separate strap to carry it with me wherever I may need to take it, and the non-slip side is great for keeping it in place while sitting. The measurements are accurate, but I wouldn't call this \"large.\" I do not like hard seating, like wood chairs in restaurants, etc., so I use this for some relief in those settings. In every case so far, however, the cushion is smaller in width and depth of the chair, so while it does provide some relief, if it was a bit wider and a bit deeper, it would provide more comfort. I have another very similar cushion that has foam cushioning, and I do like the gel cushioning better. I wouldn't consider this for long term sitting, but for a meal or sporting event, I think this helps provide some relief from sitting on hard surfaces.",

                "reviewText": "I own several butt cushions as I have sciatica and tailbone issues that are chronic. This cushion will provide cushion for those hard chairs you may find at restaurants, ball games, etc,. I have various cushions for different situations. This cushion impressed me with the fact that it didn\u2019t flatten out like some of my cushions that are made from memory foam. The inside of this cushion is different than my other cushions and while sitting on it, it did give me support unlike some of my memory foam ones. I will use this when I am going out and want a smaller cushion to carry as this one folds, which is one of the features I particularly like. However, this will not be a cushion I will use if I have to sit for a long time as it doesn\u2019t offer that sciatica and tailbone relief as some of my other cushions as this is a basic cushion that is the same width throughout the pillow. The brown color isn\u2019t the prettiest but it\u2019s not like I want to bring attention to the fact that I\u2019m carrying it and its smaller size when folded is quite nice. A good cushion for those who don\u2019t need specific areas that are designed to help take off pressure of the SI joints or tailbone but need something that will provide good relief from a hard surface.",

I use it for my dining set chairs as they are not too comfortable, the cushion helps. It's not a large size cushion and will not hold up to hours of sitting. It's portable and folds in half with a strap to secure it. The gel cushion is removable for easy cleaning. I recommend this cushion for short periods of sitting in hard chairs.",

                "reviewText": "This portable gel seat cushion opens up like a book. When folded it measures approximately 8 1/2\" x 12 1/5\" and unfolded it is approximately 12 1/5\" x 17\". When it isn't being used, there is an elastic strap attached to it that wraps around it to keep it closed making it smaller for storage in between usage. There is also a loop to use as a carrying strap for portability. I will be using this on an everyday basis on my office/desk chair which is very hard wood and uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. This cushion is thick and has firm support making it much more tollerable to sit for a long period of time. The bottom side of it has a non-slip surface to prevent it from moving around too much while it is being used. Also on the underneath side it has what look like 2 pockets, that is what I thought they were, but they are actually openings for the removal of the gel cushions. Once the cushions are removed, they can be cleaned and the cover can be thrown into the laundry. Since this cushion is so versitle, it has many possible uses. I would recommend this item for many different things.",

                "reviewText": "I was going to take pictures, but honestly, it looks accurate. I put it on my relatively new office chair, which surprisingly helped. I also put it on a wooden kitchen chair I have. It made it more comfortable. It was firmer than I was expecting, but in my experience, if a cushion is squishy out of the box, after not much use, it'll be flat and you'll be feeling the hard surface again. The bottom anti-glide surface worked. I'm at about 215lbs atm, for reference.You can get at the rubber pad through overlapping pockets on the bottom surface, which probably would help with cleaning and drying. I also took this chance to check it did have the same pattern as the pictures, and it does. The silicone waffle material is .1\" or 3.5mm thick. The actual dimensions of the cushion fell short. The silicone pad itself is 1\" deep, and the cover barely adds any more to it, so there's no way the 1.5\" claim is true. Being generous, it's 1.25\" deep.The two styles are confusing. I see they're two different prices and the cheaper one seems to ship directly from China instead of from Amazon's warehouse. Hopefully that's the only difference.Should you buy this? If you're looking for something firmer than foam, or perhaps will dry better. I think you could. Just keep in mind it's actually more like 1\" and whatever the price is. If those check out, go for it.",
