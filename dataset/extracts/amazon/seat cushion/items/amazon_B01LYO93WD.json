                "reviewText": "Very supportive lower back, tail bone and spine cushion. It's feels like firm memory foam, so it's just the right amount of softness. Now that I have to work from home on my kitchen table f-t on my computer, I needed to make my kitchen chair more supportive for my lower back. Especially, since i have a history of lower back pain. I previously had other chair pads, but they were too square shaped for my heart shaped cushion chairs, and not as supportive. So this is so much better shaped for my chairs and support for my back, and for a great price.Just keep in mind I have not had them for that long, so can't speak of longevity yet. But the quality feels great and so I don't think it wil fall apart or loose shape through out time.",

                "reviewText": "As of late we've been upgrading our existing seat cushion to these orthopedic specific designed ones. Previous to that, our seat cushions were very economical and generic (what you normally see at your local drugstores) and we've come to learn that they serve no function other than being comfortable, but comes with no actual support. Like our other upgrades, we didn't want to spend medical grade but still wanted ergonomic features - this nailed both those requirements. Our other upgrade was a honeycomb designed cushion. That was popular with some, but not others. We find this filled memory foam design seemingly more acceptable to more of us - but that's subjective, to each their own.Although still very comfortable and a pleasure to sit on, the support is evident right away. The design (the shape and contours) in conjunction with the memory foam does a good job in properly dispersing body weight and gets you in more optimum positions naturally - eg not tiring. With this, it takes pressure away from specific areas that may cause build up after long periods of use. And of course, it makes it that much more natural to achieve better posture all the while being more comfortable. The fabric and general build quality is solid, and we've so far washed it a couple of times and it's no worse for wear. We've tried it on a few different types of chair, including a leather office chair and wooden dining chair and it fits both just as well with no sliding.",
