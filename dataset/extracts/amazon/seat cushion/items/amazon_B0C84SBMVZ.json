It is comfortable, soft, cool, well made, supportive and has made a significant difference in my back pain. Before this support seat cushion my lower back was always in a lot of pain and my tailbone was so tender that I couldn't put any weight on it. I've only had this for a few days and the pain in both my lower back and my tailbone have significantly decreased. A few more days of sitting on this support seat cushion and I think I'll be pain free. This is a must have for anyone who sits for long periods of time",

                "reviewText": "There are many products on the market, and some are very expensive I decided to save a little money and go with these not a good decision as they say you get what you pay for when they first arrive they are excellent and even for a little while they are very nice and comfortable but that soon goes away as they do not hold up, we purchased two of them and one of them is as flat as a pancake already and the other one is slowly getting there. We work at home and use these every day. If you were to use them from time to time they might last a while, but not if their daily use they are terrible.",

                "reviewText": "I own many of these type orthopedic cushions and this one is by far the best. It is a bit softer, more gel like than the others. Give it a day or so to fully \"inflate\". It takes pressure off my tailbone and helps with my sciatica. I use it at the dining room table as we have hard wooden chairs and also at work. Remember it helps to take a short walk every now and then. This cushion could also be easily packed and brought to a football game or any event where the seating is not comfortable, and will make everyone else envious!",

After a short time my back starts hurting and my sitzbones burn. This donut type pillow is just what I needed. It has a high back and contoured sides that hug your backside just right reducing the pain and burning. I can sit comfortably much longer with less pain after my task is done",
