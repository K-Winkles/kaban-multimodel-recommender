I had to find a solution and here came this wonderful seat cushion. I got the largest size they offer as my chair is quite large. This cushion instantly helped reduce my pain and fixed my posture too. The cushion is nice and thick and just feels so nice. I would compare it to sitting on your bed lol. Anyways, go buy it! You won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Bought my first (smaller) one in March of last year (today is May 2). Bought my second (smaller) one in June of last year. Just bought a third (smaller) one and a large one this month. These are great.The smaller ones are used daily on plain wooden chairs and those from last year have not flattened at all as far as I can tell (structural problems and sensitive tissues). The larger one is for an upholstered chair that I need to add a bit of height to so that its leg rest isn't too high.I haven't noticed any odors with any of these nor any ridge down the middle, as some reviews state. I find the material on top to be very comfortable (I sometimes sit around in undies and appreciate the good skin feel) and I haven't noticed the seat feeling warm.I recommend them.UPDATE: The one I use constantly has flattened out to the point where I am now in search of another one. If I can't find a brand with better reviews, I will repurchase. It was really comfortable until it started to get fatigued.",

I went through at the very least 4 office chairs and at least that many seat cushions. They would be okay for a little bit and then they would start to hurt my bottom. My thighs, my butt... I would practice standing up and moving around, using footrests. YOU name it I tried it. The chairs were not cheap yet I could not bring myself to buy an Aeron office chair. TOP of the line. I have one at work.Well I found them on sale for considerably less, so I bought one and then I needed a good cushion --- tried the gel ones, etc. FINALLY this one! PERFECTION. Soft and comfortable. I am in heaven.I don't care how long it lasts -- I will buy another one. After 3 years search I found what my body needed.The perfect combination. DID I mention I was in heaven??",

                "reviewText": "I spend several hours in front of a computer every day, and often it gets a little uncomfortable when my seat gets warm or bottomed out. So, I decided to look for an extra cushion to make it a little more comfortable. This product was at a good price when I got it and one of the cheapest, so I decided to get it.The product came in just a vacuum sealed plastic. Once the plastic is removed, the seat cushion expands to its normal form. Immediately I noticed how soft the memory foam is, it is soft enough to even use as a pillow. The fabric cover is breathable and lets air pass through efficiently. It also has a zipper to remove the foam out to easily wash the fabric cover. I\u2019ve been using this seat cushion while gaming, and I noticed that I don\u2019t sweat that much anymore down there. I usually take quick breaks every 30 minutes to let my skin breathe, but now I can sit longer comfortably. Even if I sit several hours, once I get up, the seat cushion expands again to its original form. Very good quality.Overall, I\u2019m glad that I bought this seat cushion, I now can play my video games longer comfortably. The memory foam quality is excellent and can last a long time. If you are looking for more comfort in your office chair, don\u2019t buy a new chair, just grab one of this seat cushions.",

Rather than but a whole new chair I opted for this cushion to soften things up a bit. It does the job and provides a very comfortable padding that distributes the load evenly and allows sitting at the computer for a longer period (as if that's a good thing). However, I wish it was larger to better cover the existing chair seat as it certainly looks like an add-on with about a 2\" border on the perimeter of the pad that the pad does not cover on the original chair pad. Fortunately I don't have a big butt, so it doesn't affect me that much but I do think it would look better and even feel better if it fit the chair pad better. Thickness is fine and firmness is perfect.",
