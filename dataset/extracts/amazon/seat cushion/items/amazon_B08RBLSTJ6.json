            "GEL ENHANCED SEAT CUSHION - If you want premium high-density memory foam plus gel, our pick is the Gel Enhanced Seat Cushion. The memory foam is durable, comfortable, and long-lasting while the gel prevents the cushion from feeling too hot. A soft, machine-washable short plush cover makes it easy to keep clean. Non-slip rubber dots on the bottom means it won't slide out of your chair as you shift around",
            "QUITE PORTABLE CHAIR CUSHION - The carrying handle makes it easy to move from seat to seat and it's perfectly sized for a work chair or use in a wheelchair. Great for office, home, travel, car seat or wheelchair use. You can even use it outdoors, but the cover isn't waterproof, so save it for dry weather",
            "ERGONOMIC \"U\" SHAPED CUTOUT DESIGN - Whether you're working from home, sitting in an office chair, a car or truck, or any kind of seat at all, the U-shaped cutout for your tailbone is specifically designed to maximize comfort and support while reducing pressure on your tailbone. The CYLEN office chair cushion can make your day more enjoyable and keep away those aches and pains",
            "IT\u2019S A COMMON BYPRODUCT OF FATIGUE - You might slouch or begin leaning forward at an uncomfortable angle at your desk, and you might not even register the discomfort right away because your mind is intently elsewhere. This comfort seat cushion features ergonomic design to help soothe already-existing aches and pains that came about after months or even years of slouching and leaning",
            "TIPS - Since it\u2019s made of high-density memory foam, keep in mind that the firmness of the cushion can be affected by temperature fluctuations. Especially in cold weather, many users mention removing the cushion from the car; otherwise, it can become firm and hard and won\u2019t return to its soft, supportive state until the material warms up again"

In January 2016, our customer feedback center colleague Sam feedback to the R &amp D team a common customer demand: Many customers and colleagues because of long-term sitting at the desk, driving a car, some lumbar pelvic surgery, and some long-term wheelchairs, many people feel very uncomfortable, and even lumbar pain, hope we can help them develop a product to relieve the pressure on the tailbone. At the same time our colleagues in the call center felt the same way, so on February 17, 2016 our team decided to form a Jason centric project team to find a solution to help everyone and our colleagues. In order to find the perfect solution, our market researcher Robin spent 60 days visiting orthopedic centers, nursing homes, truckers' clubs, aircrew clubs, rehabilitation centers, etc. to collect relevant data.",

As the U-shaped hollow part will not touch the tailbone point of force, to avoid pressure on the tailbone. We all believe this is a very good idea! Our engineering department started to make the mold and after 10 times of improvement we finally produced a cushion with a size that fits most of our customers, but of course it doesn't fit all people, because it's hard to adjust to all people, right?",

The handle is convenient and the cushion is the perfect size. Overall, only positive things to say at this point; definitely worth the money!",

Unlike other cushions (because we've even gotten ones doctors recommended, you know, the butt donuts.) This one doesn't just flatten when you sit on it! It stays firm but also has enough give to cradle you. I've even used it for my long drives all over the country for work. No more post-roadtrip butt pain!Dislikes? None. He's had no complaints at all over it.Over-all, this cushion is perfect for his needs, and I am just as satisfied \ud83d\ude0c",

It\u2019s super comfortable and makes sitting for long hours of the days much more relaxing.
