However, the coarse texture of the fabric is not comfortable. I purchased this seat to relieve tailbone pressure. The cushion is too firm. My butt doesn't settle into the seat. For context, I use a Purple Double Seat Cushion daily. I love my Purple cushion but it is too heavy and large to carry around on airplanes. So my search continues. I can't speak to the effectiveness of this cushion for other back/butt ailments.",
