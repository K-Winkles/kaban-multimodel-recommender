People who tried it commented that they liked the experience and it would help them sit longer comfortably, but only in contrast to a thinly cushioned hard surface. And it breathes which is good. Soft plastics tend to not age well. One could combine it with a thin soft cushioning layer on top for very extended sitting and so it lasts longer. Perhaps a layer of wool like an old sweater would not interfere with breathability.",

I have been amazed how this simple little cushion has allowed me to be either a passenger or driver in the car and can last several hours without discomfort! In fact, I purchased a second one so I could leave one in the car and take the other with me into restaurants, theaters, or anywhere I know the seating is a problem for my back and leg pain.",
