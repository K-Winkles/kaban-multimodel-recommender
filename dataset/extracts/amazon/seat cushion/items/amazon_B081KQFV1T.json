                "reviewText": "I have been using this cushion in my home office chair for some time now and it provides great cushioning without being thick and throwing off the balance of my chair and wearing it out. It is cool and comfortable for long days doing work. The only issue with it is that the slick cover of the cushion on my slick chair meant when I turned the chair without sitting in it to stow it at the end of the day the cushion slides off. This is particularly annoying on a hard wood floor that might have some dust or dirt on it, although that brushes off of the cushion easily. So I added about an 8x10 piece of some rubber non-slip matting like one might put under a tray or rug (similar to https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Preperation-Non-Adhesive-Anti-Slip-untensils/dp/B00DOYDIWQ/ but that I got a far cheaper equivalent for at Dollar General pre-COVID) and the cushion now stays in place.",

One, it tends to keep body heat in, unlike a fabric cushion. So, on a hot day it can feel uncomfortably warm. And two, it moves when you sit down or stand up. I use it on a drafting chair, so I have to hold it on place when I get into my chair. Not a deterrent....just not a five star. One thing I love is that it provides quite a bit of comfortable cushion and it's thin. I don't feel like I have to balance all day like I did with the thicker cushion I used to have.Good cushion.

However, when you are sitting with your back to the chair it's just fine, just not a stance I sit most often when working.It works decent, and the fabric/material of the product itself isn't bothersome to me and so I am completely fine with those aspects.",

I have had it for several months and it was always slipping off my chair. However, I took the advice from Mr. Roboto's review and added some rubber non-slip matting that I bought from Dollar General to keep it in place--it works like a charm!",

Putting a regular cushion on it doesn't work because it adds too much height to the seat. This gel cushion makes the seat softer to sit on and doesn't add much height. So mission accomplished on that!",

Especially the tailbone area.This cushion was definitely a significant improvement. No pain in the lower back/tailbone area. It folds well enough to fit into my backpack, and the weight is acceptable. I tried another cushion as well, but that was to big to handle while traveling.",
