                "reviewText": "I thought about getting a new office chair, but really my main problem was bad cushioning. I thought I would give this cushion a try this first. And even if it wasn't good enough to make the old chair livable, at least I could use it on a new chair, right?So far it's meeting my expectations. The size is big enough to cover almost the entire seat (larger than other foam cushions I was looking at). The cushion is thick and dense enough that I don't sink down and feel the chair surface anymore. I used to feel my hip bone poking against the hard seat, so this is a big relief.The foam seems to have good rebound. It arrived vacuum sealed and puffed up almost immediately upon releasing it from the plastic. Every time I get up, it puffs up pretty quickly. I guess time will tell on how long its resilience will last. Only gripe is it does have that new foam chemical smell, but it is lessening over time.I don't know how well the gel is working, but I haven't felt like the seat had gotten too hot while I've been sitting anyway. The grippy dots on the bottom do help the cushion stay in place, and I like the velour fabric because I feel like that also adds a bit of grip.All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase. My sitting experience is much improved, so I feel like I got my money's worth (especially since I got it on discount during the holidays).Edit: After having the cushion for a few months, I can say that the chemical smell does last quite a while. I have had a similar scent issue with gel/foam combos before. I Febreze'd the pillow with the fabric cover on a couple of times, and that did help.",

I thought it was time get a new one.It is light years better than the one it was intended to replace. And that one was pretty good at the time.It's very comfortable and supportive. It was on sale 46% off and turned out to be cheaper than my old one.If you have issues that require a seat cushion or you simply want extra cushion for your office chair, you cannot go wrong with this product.I bought a second one for me and an additional one to send as a gift.",

It has eased pressure on my tailbone and back and it is much easier to get up and down now. The cushion is nice and thick as you can see it is bigger than my pointer finger . Highly recommend this cushion for anyone with back problems.",
