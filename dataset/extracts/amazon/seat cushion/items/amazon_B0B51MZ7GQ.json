                "reviewText": "I am reviewing \u201cGel Seat Cushion for Long Sitting Breathable Honeycomb Gel Cushion Tailbone Pain Relief Office Chair Cushion Gel Relief\u201d. To be honest, I didn\u2019t have high hopes for this seat cushion, but now I am so happy and impressed! I\u2019ve had back pain for years, been to at least a half dozen different doctors, did PT, yoga, etc, but have had little relief from constant back pain, particularly while seated. This seat cushion is so comfortable and it really helps my back not hurt as much while I\u2019m sitting at my computer. I do have a good quality office chair, but my back would still hurt constantly. This chair cushion has made a big difference for me.It\u2019s not the biggest cushion at 16.5\"x14.5\"x1.4\", but it is big enough and covers my office chair seat adequately (I am a small woman and a larger person might find it to be somewhat small). I was worried it would be too thin, but the thickness is just right and adds a nice amount of softness while not diminishing support. I don\u2019t find the cushion to be hot. The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is that the cover looks a little bit loose to me and I wish it were a bit tighter fitting. Of course, I cannot see it while I\u2019m sitting, so it\u2019s really a non-issue. The cover has small grippy nubs on the underside and they do keep the cushion in place quite well.I\u2019m very happy with this chair cushion because it helps my back feeling better throughout the day. Also, it is very reasonably priced and I think it is totally worth a try! I\u2019m really glad that I tried it. I am considering getting a second one to use in a different location.",

                "reviewText": "I sit for 9 hours a day with very few breaks. I have a very nice, brand name, EXPENSIVE chair that I fight with all day long. I constantly feel as if I am sliding forward out of it and the mesh that is supposed to be so comfortable hurts after a long day. I have tried other molded cushions that have holes and splits for all your parts and bits and they are even worse after a few hours of compression. They are way too thick and mess up the height of the arms with relation to your desk. They also fall out when you get up.This little cushion solves ALL of those problems!It is slightly smaller than my seat which I actually prefer because it allows me to place it exactly where I want it (which is closer to the front edge). It is thin so I don't feel as if I am balancing on it all day. The little grippies keep it in place so it doesn't shift and slide when I get up and down. It's lightweight and easy to lift up and slide over when I switch computers and angles. I have been looking for a solution to my issues for over a year. 100% this solves all of them. I would have never expected so much from something so small and cheap. I am sharing this with my coworker who has all of the same complaints about her chair.",
