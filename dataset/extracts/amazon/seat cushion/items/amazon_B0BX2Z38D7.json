                "reviewText": "I got the larger version of the pillow. I first have to admit that the first evening I tried it, I used it backwards! The u shaped pillow is used with the legs of the \u201cu\u201d in the back. That way works better if you have tailbone pain because you sit on it and there\u2019s an open space for your tailbone so that it doesn\u2019t come into contact with anything. It makes sense when you think about it but I don\u2019t always think at first. I felt I should admit to that because I suppose there could be others out there who might not be thinking about it when they first try the pillow out. It won\u2019t work for tailbone pain if you sit on it the opposite way and could definitely aggravate it. But hopefully others are thinking more than I did when they first try this. So I normally sit on my recliner and since I\u2019ve lost 120 pounds, I ended up with tailbone pain. I asked my doctor what kind of specialist would deal with this and she responded that she thought it was probably from loss of subcutaneous tissue and that she didn\u2019t think a specialist would be necessary, that it should try a donut pillow. But Amazon has some things that pop up when you search for something that look even better and I chose this one for the description and the price. And the look that appeared to be more comfortable than a standard donut pillow. I\u2019ve been using it for a couple of days now and I feel that it\u2019s working for my tailbone pain because it prevents me tailbone from making contact with anything, which results in the pain I was having. It\u2019s a hard pillow but I think it needs to be or it might not prevent me from sinking into it and my tailbone would make contact with the seat of whatever chair I\u2019m sitting on. It\u2019s comfortable when I consider the pain I would otherwise be having. I feel this is a good quality pillow and the price is right and I would recommend it to my best friend or anyone else who has tailbone pain.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Overall, I really like this seat cushion and I'm glad I purchased it. I'm in grad school and sit in lectures for 8 hours a day. It's very soft and comfortable to sit on and I like that it has the rubber grips on the back so it doesn't slide around in your chair. I really like that it has a carrying handle because it makes it easy to take with me when I can't leave it at my chair. My only complaint is that if you are short like myself, your feet may not touch the ground anymore when you're sitting on this cushion, which can make your legs a little uncomfortable.",

This is important for keeping pressure of my weight off of my spine. It has done that thus far. I researched lots of these in other to make the right choice because I like to spend wisely. This seat is comfortable while holding its shape wonderfully. If you are very consciences of protecting your back you should be pleased with this one.",

I had a cotton covered foam donut pillow that worked wonders, was so comfy but after 30 years it had to be disposed of and I still can\u2019t find a suitable replacement. Every other one is so much more costly!",
