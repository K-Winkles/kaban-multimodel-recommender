                "reviewText": "I got this super large gel seat cushion to put on my gaming chair because the stitching in the seat is tearing apart. I have mixed feelings about this cushion. It\u2019s large! Which is awesome! I have big hips and back end, I hate the feeling of flowing off the sides of cushions and chairs that are too small. So I really appreciate the larger size and it actually fits my gaming chair perfectly. The covers for the cushion look really cheap. When I first opened it, I thought they were covers to wash the insert, not the actual cover itself. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m missing something and the cover shouldn\u2019t be used? In the pictures it shows models not using the covers, so I\u2019m not sure. The cushion is really comfortable. I can sit for extended times and not feel discomfort like I do without the cushion. I like that the honeycomb structure allows for airflow, so you don\u2019t get sweaty there when warmer. One more thing, I wish there was a way to attach this to the chair, even if there was a Velcro strap to make it stay in place when getting up and down. I am having to adjust it every time I move. I have noticed that if you use it without the cover, it stays in place in better. Another bonus is it being washable. It also adds some height to you. I\u2019m 5-10 and don\u2019t need the extra height, but it\u2019s the perfect height to work on my posture. It makes my knees 90 degrees and my elbows at the table 90 degree. I also seem to keep my back straighter. So it\u2019s worth it just for that alone. Even though I have mixed feelings about this cushion, I am still glad I got it and would probably get it again. I might try to make a cover for it to make it a little more stylish.",

                "reviewText": "I got this pad because I have serious lower back issues and I was looking for something to work on my office chair in conjunction with lumbar support to make sitting less on a torture test. This pad comes with two attractive covers. Both the covers and the seat pad are easily washable.You gotta love the folks who write marketing copy for products, amplifying every tiny detail into grandiose proclamations. This is a piece of honeycombed thermoplastic rubber with a removable mesh cover. That\u2019s all it is. I cannot attest to any magical properties claimed on the web page, nor can I determine if my buttocks have become more beautiful after using this seat cushion. I wasn\u2019t courageous enough to test this with an egg on my good office chair. But I can with certainly say that it\u2019s more comfortable sitting on this pad than on my office chair without the pad.",

                "reviewText": "As I've gotten older, I find it more and more uncomfortable to sit on hard surfaces like bleachers. I enjoy attending my grandkids games and performances, so I knew I had to find a decent cushion.This is just the ticket. I didn't want a stadium seat style, just a cushion, and this one is great. Thanks to the gripping surface on one side, it doesn't slide around. It's supportive, firm, but comfy. The material seems sturdy, and the construction is good quality. It's a little big, but that could be a plus for some people. The separate cover is a nice bonus.",

                "reviewText": "We got this for use in the car, especially for longer trips. We are using it in a Toyota Sienna minivan and it covers the front seat (Driver's or Passenger's) completely. Any bigger and it would be too big.It is comfortable. A little unwieldy when you need to move it around, but usually you are just placing it and sitting on it. I found that my rear end is much less sore after longer drivers (especially more than a couple hours) when I use this than when sitting on the car seat itself.The product description shows using it on an airplane. You could, for sure, but like I said, it is a little unwieldy and taking it on a plan would take some of your precious bag space.Using this does raise you up in the seat. This can be a good thing for someone who wants to be a little higher. It can be a bad thing if your head is already close to the top of the vehicle. If you don't have much clearance when you sit in your car seat, adding this might cause your head to hit the ceiling.It is great that it has two covers, so you can wash one while using the other.At $40 it is a little steep in price, but worth it if you use it regularly. The price is the main reason I gave it 4 stars. I think it should be in the $30 range.",
