She used it for quite awhile but then she felt it wasn't doing what she needed. My mother uses a thinner softer cushion that works better for her. I'm sure this is great for others but it wasn't the solution I had hoped for. The quality is great I can tell it will last a long time. For now we are storing it and maybe she will go back to using it in the future.",

This cushion does an overall good job at relieving any pain that comes from sitting too long and helps to relieve soreness in the tailbone area. The thing I do not like about this cushion is that it's not a full seat, so you have to sit on it in the exact area and it doesn't feel as secure as other cushions I've tried that are a full seat design. This serves its purpose, but is not my first choice when picking a cushion.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a big guy with tailbone issues, a lower back injury, piles, and a horribly bony bottom that can't sit comfortably on most seats. Hard chairs feel like concrete while soft couches put pressure on my back, so I need to have a ring cushion to help me as often as I can get one. This cushion not only provided the right amount of support for my weight with its firm memory foam, but also had cutouts in the front and back so my bottom didn't get stuffy. Best of all, the non-skid dots on the bottom of the pad kept it still on hard seats like when I'm riding the subway or bus. It's my definite favorite and offers better support than flimsy air donut-type pillows.Please see the attached photos. Pardon if Amazon has switched their order after my review.Image 1: Well-Packaged. I loved that this cushion wasn't packed flat as paper in a vacuum bag. It came as-is in a box and wasn't flattened or in need of me letting it sit for ages to puff back to shape. It was good to go fresh from the Amazon box and wasn't misshapen in any way. Fantastic packing!Image 2: The Cushion. This sweet seat is the saddle of angels. The shape of it helps my bottom get some air and not get sweaty as compared to the ring-type pillow I used to use. The taller areas also offer support right where I need beneath my upper thighs and my leg bones, keeping pressure off sensitive areas while leaving a gap as well for my sore tailbone and piles. I love this design!Image 3: The Foam. Here's my wife giving the inner foam a poke, and the stuff sure is sturdy! It doesn't flatten at all with prolonged sitting, even though I'm well over 200 pounds, the foam also shaping well to the shape of me without giving out like an air cushion. I likewise love that the outer cover can be unzipped and removed for easy cleaning.Image 4: The Non-Skid Dots. This is the stuff that made this cushion an absolute winner! I need support the most on the hard seats of subways and buses, but ring cushions and pillows I've had in the past just slip right off! These rubbery microdots are a game changer, keeping on my pillow and seat without me needing to readjust or brace myself with my feet. I chose this pillow primarily based on this feature, and it sure did deliver! No sliding even on a 2 hour bus ride! The materials are quality and work well for my large and bony body, keeping puffed even after I've used it a couple of weeks and every day.",

However, the memory foam is relatively firm, so I start to feel mild discomfort elsewhere after sitting on the cushion for about 2 hours. Although I am still searching for a similar cushion that I can comfortably sit on for at least 4 hours, I am in no way displeased with the product.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice alternative to the old-fashioned rubber 'donut' that one ends up getting for various bottom-related issues. Once you need a donut, the options are really rather limited. The rubber donut is happily easily found, and easily blown up, and it works in many cases, thankfully, but it sort of feels like you're sitting on a balloon. The donut pillow is a nice alternative that doesn't have that balloon feeling with it. It's made of memory foam, and comes boxed as-is (not vacuum-packed). It's firm, but with a lot of give to it, and has the necessary donut shaping for comfort. It feels good to sit on -- more like a cushion than a 'device', but still functional as needed. I like that it's a little more 'discreet' than a traditional donut (mine, at least, is bright red/orange), and I like that I'm not feeling like I have to maintain my balance while I sit. Long term use, or use during a more painful flare might be different, but I'm glad to have another option besides my old-school donut for sitting comfort.",

                "reviewText": "I have a similar product of another brand, and this one is comfy and a little smaller, which is much better for my wife! (She said that sitting on the other one feels like sitting on a toilet seat, so she prefers the size of this.) These are her words:\"I like the rubber grips on the bottom, because they help the cushion stay in place on my plastic office chair. The material is breathable, and the cover is removable. It makes sitting for long stretches of time more comfortable, but I honestly don't know if that's because it's a cushion or if the donut shape is helping. Ordered for pregnancy-induced hemorrhoid care, and hoping it helps for postpartum care as well.\"This definitely allows for longer periods of sitting, but we will wait to see how it fares with actual pain reduction before giving it a perfect 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I am recovering from cancer, chemo, radiation, surgeries, and a hip that is out of alignment. Needless to say, sitting is an ongoing issue. But this donut is amazing! It is firm yet comfortable, it doesn't slip, and your body fits into the donut part just right. The cover comes off and can be washed, an added bonus. It holds its form. I recommend this product to everyone who has problems with sitting. It won't cure you and it's not magic, but it will greatly improve your comfort. I have tried cushions and other pillows, but this has been the best.",
