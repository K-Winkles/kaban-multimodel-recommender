It hurts to sit on my lazy butt so it's kind of one of those things that I have ignored because I should probably walk around more anyway. But it was getting to the point that it hurt to walk because the backs of my legs, right below my rump, were hurting so badly. My desk chair at work is fine and it's not worn out. I think I just sit too much.I ordered this thinking maybe it would work. I just got it, so I have no idea if it is sturdy and will last for a while or not, but if it doesn't, then I know I just need to get a pricier version of the same thing.It is not soft like a big cushion or anything. The pad is firm-soft. So it almost feels like you are sitting on a water bed maybe? Like you are sitting on a waterbed when someone is laying on the other side so it's a little firm?I don't know if this would bring new life to a totally worn out chair, but it definitely helps with a decent but maybe under-padded chair. Worth the price.",

No problem there.My beefs are that it\u2019s not very grippy as it claims. It does slide around a bit when I get up, etc.. it\u2019s livable. And my other beef is that the description is a little confusing? It states cushionS. Shows an image of cushionS. I didn\u2019t necessarily need two cushions, but the title and description is a little misleading.So, if you\u2019re thinking that your getting TWO CUSHIONS, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re getting a cushion with 2 covers. One black cover and one grey cover.Speaking of cushions, no idea about the difference between purple, black or blue cushions. Maybe I missed that (too) in the description? Bottom line - works well. But I would imagine that all of the identical looking cushions to this on Amazon are, well, identical. So pick the cheapest one.",

I was using pillows at first but that wasn\u2019t really working very well but this cushion so far is a relief to my buttocks.It keeps in place, it\u2019s large enough to accommodate my BBW \ud83c\udf51 and is soft and relieves the ache I use to have when just using pillows or nothing.It has a zippered cover to take off for easy cleaning and you can just take it any where you travel it\u2019s flexible and easy to fit in any bag. I have use it so far on my chair and on car rides. I would suggest this product because it does give relief for those sitting on hard surfaces or want extra support and cushion for their bum. Excellent product so far.",

Though they both had that cool patterned purple inner component, the cheaper one was a bit thicker and better suited for its application in relieving sciatic pain.
