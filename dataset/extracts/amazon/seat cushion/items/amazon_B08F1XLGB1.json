Two are going back. They actually cause pain because of the cupped seat design.Like car seats, cushions that cradle your bottom hit too many pressure points.This is the only one of the four that fit in my CrossTrek. No pressure points. Soft enough. I have two because we have two Subarus. I forgot to take my cushion the other day and was quickly in pain. Now the cushions stay in each car.I must admit that another brand is the one I prefer on my sofa. I don\u2019t know what it is.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent: works exactly as described. Note that it works best when you are in a chair that allows you to sit straight, rather than slouching. The shape of the pad promotes sitting upright and straight. While no pad can eliminate pain, this is a significant reduction in sitting on a standard gel pad, pillow or soft chair/couch. I also recommend wearing loose pants/trousers. Tighter fitting clothes tend to press more firmly against the infected/effected area. Easy to clean and the cover can be removed via zipper to be washed.",
