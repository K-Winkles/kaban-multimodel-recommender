                "reviewText": "Overall these are quite comfy. I have enjoyed the seat Cushion part. The back Cushion is a bit more difficult to fit to my gaming chair as the way it curves means it doesn't exactly sit in the right spot. I have made it work but just something to keep in mind. Furthermore I will say there was a bad smell when we pulled it out of the box but that went away fairly quickly. Overall solid product.",

Only used a few times so far but seem to be a well made product at this point.",
