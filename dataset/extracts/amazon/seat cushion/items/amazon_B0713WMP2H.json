Not only is it comfortable, it keeps me from getting cold when sitting on metal chairs in the winter. The fact that it folds and has a carrying handle just ups the stars for me! I often move to multiple locations in one day and it\u2019s so easy to clip it to my bag when traveling between locations. One less thing to carry! Yay!

It folds in half as designed and fits nicely into my backpack (biggest pocket). I pull it out when and if I need it. It fits nicely on the plane seat, and I just plop myself right on top of it. It would be nice if it was a bit deeper in dimension, to cover more of the seat, but I can work around it. It is memory foamy, and does not get hot. I still need to get up and walk around the cabin to stretch some now and again - it is not a magic cushion. But sure is nice to have this handy.",

Others were not consistent, or continuously comfortable, too thick (3\"), or too heavy to be easily portable. This one is very thin and lightweight, folds nicely for transport, and fits great in the living room chair, office chair, and car seat. I turned the cushion around to have the side with the breathing holes to be under the seat bones. MUCH more comfortable. I can see using it to go to stadium games. I recommend you give it a try.

                "reviewText": "I travel a lot, and often for long distances. I also suffer from lower back pain. I have tried many seat cushion products over the years in an attempt to ease my discomfort in sitting for long periods. this device is clever and effective. It is angled so as to give maximum support to the rear, tapering to the front. It has cooling gel so it does not heat up. It has a groove down the middle as often recommended by doctors. It has built in handles and folds in half so is easy to carry, as well as place on a seat. It has a plastic bottom so it can be used on stadium seats, bleachers, office chairs, or airline seats. This is an effective product at a rather reasonable price.",
