                "reviewText": "First, please ignore the condition of my husband\u2019s office chair! :) It\u2019s like a favorite, old ratty t-shirt at this point!I gave this seat cushion 3 stars because it\u2019s made well and to me, it\u2019s not uncomfortable, although it does feel weird and you need to get used to it - but it\u2019s too small. Because it\u2019s too small it hits your legs in weird ways or if you have it the other direction, it hits your sides strange, which hurts the comfort.If it was a bit bigger, it would be more comfortable. The height, about an inch, was perfect for my needs!I have a bad back and I do feel more supported sitting on it. It\u2019s firm but not hard. It\u2019s a honeycomb sort of silicone, the listing is pretty accurate on that.I\u2019m 5\u20192, 108 lbs. My husband sat on it who is 5\u201910\u201d, 190 lbs and he actually found it a bit more comfortable than me, maybe his weight squishes it down more.I included another pad that was advertised similarly on Amazon and you can see the difference in size. I shouldn\u2019t have been lazy and measured. The gray one is too tall for me and my husband stole it for his actual office chair, that has height adjustment (terrible chair pics!). It was too tall for this chair I use to puzzle. I will try to break this one in. I\u2019m also not on it 8 hours a day.I also included pics on a pretty small cheap Staples mesh chair so you could get an idea.If this was the same size as the other to fit a standard office chair seat, I would have rated it higher. I received this through Vine for my honest review. I also picked up a seat cushion for my son at college and he loves it. I\u2019m just having less luck.",
