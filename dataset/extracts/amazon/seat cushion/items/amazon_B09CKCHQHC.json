But, I was a bit disappointed that it didn\u2019t provide more of a \u201ccushion\u201d per say. It\u2019s still very firm, which is what I assume it was intended! And I\u2019m happy with it. But it didn\u2019t improve my comfort which I hoped it would. Its not bad enough that I would return it. I just wish the middle would have had a little more cushion.",

I drive a 2013 Mazda 3. The cushion fits fine. It doesn't taper on one end and that makes all the difference.",
