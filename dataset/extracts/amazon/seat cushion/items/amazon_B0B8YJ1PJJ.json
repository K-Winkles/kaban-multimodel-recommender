        "description": "Finally there is a seat cushion which fulfilled the demands of competitive sport and hobby athletes . With years of experience in the sport of rowing our Seat Pad has been developed and constantly optimized for you. It was important for us to find the perfect balance between comfort and performance. Long sessions several times a week should be possible without the butt becoming a limiting factor. With a high training volume, painful pressure points, irritation points or even open wounds can quickly develop. This is completely prevented with our seat pad. On the other hand, we also did not want to cushion too much, that you has the feeling to lose contact to the ergometer and sitting too high. If the sitting position becomes too high, it is no longer possible to apply force to the legs at the correct angle. As a result, the performance is reduced and worst possible injuries may occur. The 0,6IN / 15mm thickness is perfect for comfort and performance. Features. - This seat pad will do your butt well - with the seat cushion even long workouts become super easy - Seat Pad has been specially designed for the Concept2 Indoorrower -12mm thick neoprene-like plastic that is non-slip - The training is becomes comfortable without pressure and sore spots - Durable and robust material - perfect for training on the Concept2 rowing ergometer - non-slip surface which prevents sliding back and forth on the rolling seat - 0,6IN / 15mm padding is perfect to cushion the buttocks very well, at the same time you do not feel too high to sit - After training the sweat can simply be washed off as water resistant material - fits in every sports bag - In the gym, you will save yourself sitting directly on a sweaty seat",

Man sitzt weich und gekauft hab ich sie mir weil mir bei l\u00e4ngeren Einheiten am Ergometer immer der Hintern anf\u00e4ngt zu schmerzen. Damit ist es zwar um einiges besser aber f\u00fcr mich noch nicht genug daher auch nur 4 Sterne. Zu diesem Preis kann man aber beim Kauf nix falsch machen",
