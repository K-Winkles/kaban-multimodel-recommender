I've been using it for 4 work days now and I just cant find any comfort. For me when I sit on it, it flattens completely and almost hurts worse to sit on than my bland office chair cushion. Very disappointed. I wanted it to work out!! :( For reference I am an 5'9\" female and I weigh 265 pounds.",

Was having some break down on his backside, so got this to try and relieve that pressure. Once he figured out how to use it and make sure it was turned the right way. It helped him very much. It has taken the pressure off his tailbone while still being comfortable. He says it doesn\u2019t feel bulky at all underneath in his recliner. I highly recommend this to anyone needing to relieve pressure due to an injured tail bone or to assist with diminishing pressure.",
