It would work well for wheelchair seats, as it is large. I was looking for a cushion as comfortable as an egg crate type. This one is. It does not have an objectionable oder as another one that I tried and had to return. I am very happy with this and intend to buy another to leave in another car.",

                "reviewText": "I sat on a Purple cushion once in a store demo and have wanted one ever since. But real people can't just throw $100 away on one seat cushion. Just bought this knock-off when I had to replace a ragged memory foam cushion. It's big enough to cover the whole seat, which I like, and very comfortable when I first sit down on it. The one place it falls short is that the gel gets softer and less supportive as it warms, which means the longer you sit on it, the deeper you sink into it. So, it's very comfy at first but after sitting for a time, I've sunk into it to the point where I'm basically sitting on the surface under it, and the cushion is no longer doing much to help. I like the feel of the gel and the fact that if I spill coffee on it, it isn't going to soak into it (Yep, that's what happened to the one I'm replacing). But the good price of this one gets a bit lost now that I realize I'll have to purchase an extra one or another memory foam layer to put under it.",

Just shifting around on the chair, the cushion somehow works its way to the lip of the chair seat and has to be repositioned or it falls to the floor. The comfort factor could easily be specific to the user, so YMMV.",

Bought the medium thickness as I was hesitant to buy the thickest model as I thought it would be too soft and unstable. Wishing I had bought the thicker one. This one is comfortable and does help with hard chairs. Washable cover is handy and seems to be durable. After pricing lots of cushions this one was one of the better options. Not a bad choice but would buy the thicker model if I had it to do over.",
