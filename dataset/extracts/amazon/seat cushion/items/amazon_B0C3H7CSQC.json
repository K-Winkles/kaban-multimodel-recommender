                "reviewText": "Finally, an ergonomic shaped butt pad that isn't crazy expensive (Comfort Lab). I purchased the XL version for my car even though I'm 5'10 and 150lbs. Fits my car perfectly and the anti-slip material actually does it's job on my leather interior. I live the way all of the curves naturally hug your lower body as soon as you strap in. As someone who suffers from herniated L4 and L5 disc's, this pillow is a game changer! Previous car cushions I have tried all slid around ontop of leather, had too little or too firm of support, or just weren't large enough. This is my new daily driver \ud83d\udcaf.",

                "reviewText": "I have degenerative osteoarthritis in my hips and spine, and also do a lot of sitting for my job. I have tried inexpensive cushions and expensive ones and wasn't able to find any that would allow me to sit comfortably for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time. After reading the reviews for this cushion, I decided to give it a try. So far, so good! The shape is a little different from other cushions I have tried. It is on the large side, so if you have a skinny tush, It might not work for you. It feels about right for me (my hips are approx. 44\"). I will update later if there are any changes, but so far I am pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Jaa, dieses Sitzkissen ist bei langem Sitzen viel angenehmer, auch und gerade, weil ich im Sessel nicht so sitze, wie bei diesem Kissen vorgesehen. (das Kissen ist eher f\u00fcr die B\u00fcrositzhaltung konzipiert. Ich hingegen habe einen Drehsessel mit Fu\u00dfhocker, in dem ich fast liege, also mit dem Po sehr weit nach vorne rutsche). Nun hat dieser Sessel aber keine Sprungfedern, da ist nur ne schmale durchgesessene Schaumstoffplatte drin, darunter die harte Sesselschale. In dieser Sitzhaltung sitze ich genau auf der Trennkerbe zwischen Kugel des Oberschenkelknochengelenks und Pfanne des Beckenknochengelenks und zerre dabei bei l\u00e4ngerem Sitzen das Gelenk, das tut mit der Zeit irre weh. Auch bildete ich genau unter dem Strei\u00dfbein bereits an kleiner Stelle Schorfige Haut, also wundgesessen. Mit diesem Sitzkissen gleicht sich das gut aus, die Schmerzen treten auch nach 10 Stunden sitzen nicht mehr auf. Die hinteren Zungen habe ich bei dieser Sitzhaltung auf H\u00f6he der Nieren, sie st\u00f6ren jedoch nicht, stabilisieren eher den R\u00fccken, die sind gut und richtig da. Also das Sitzkissen ist gut! In normaler, aufrechter Sitzposition ist es ein Sitzgef\u00fchl wie auf einem Autositz eines Sportwagens.So allerdings sitzt ja kaum wer zu Hause in seinem Fernsehsessel oder Gamersessel, insbesondere bei Auslegung mit Fu\u00dfhocker, der ja genau dazu bestimmt ist, gem\u00fctlich darin halb zu liegen im wohligem \"haaach-Gef\u00fchl\". Optisch pa\u00dft das Sitzkissen auch gut zum Sessel, ich hab \u00fcber dem einen Bezug dr\u00fcber, der sieht genauso aus wie das Kissen. Und das Sitzkissen ist sch\u00f6n rutschfest, viele sagen ja sowas und denn iss nich an dem, nein, das Kissen verrutscht wirklich nicht, egal wie viel man drauf \"ruml\u00fcmmelt\". Das Sitzkissen ist eine seehr gro\u00dfe Hilfe f\u00fcr mich!",
