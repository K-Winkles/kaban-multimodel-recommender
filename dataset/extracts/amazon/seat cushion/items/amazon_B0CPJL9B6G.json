I put down the non slip side so that I can kneel comfortably when bathing the child. Yes, it can be folded up and has a handle, so if we go on a trip, I can also bring it with me. This is perfect for me, especially for mothers/grandmothers who have to kneel by the bathtub to give their children a bath, but their knees are painful and unbearable. It's much better than on a tile floor! The gel is very thick and can fully meet the needs of the knees. If I want to take it to church to kneel, it can even be used (with a handle!)! There are also kneeling pads in the church, but they are not as comfortable as this gel.it is still worth it because it relieves the pain and injury in my arthritis affected knee.",
