The front is also dipped to about 2\" thick where your thighs rest, making a very comfortable trough. The gap in the back relieves any weight that would be on your tailbone.The bottom is covered with small hard silicon or plastic \"dots\" that grip other material, holding it in place.A detachable adjustable strap allows the cushion to be fixed to the chair or seat back, so it further resists moving. It won't be pulled off when exiting the chair.There is an attached handle for carrying that's part of a removeable cover for cleaning. The foam inside is not washable.The extra width and thigh positioning make this a great wheel chair pad.It also would make a great car seat cushion or just a cushion on a hard chair. The foam is dense enough that it gives good support without lifting too much.4 stars",

She said it is very comfortable and she no longer has a sore!",
