                "reviewText": "This is a Vine review for a unique gel chair/seat cushion. Oddly enough this was being tested to potentially take the place of a larger gel cushion I got for a wood kitchen chair. It had very much the same traction on the bottom of the cover as this one, but after three months that traction was gone. I will have to allow that the cushion was both square and too large for the U-shaped chair seat, possible leading to excessive and unfair forces. It\u2019s plausible. It\u2019s also plausible that this non-slip surface won\u2019t last. That cushion has been retired to a vehicle for long distance trips, and where slippage is not an issue. So that long story for review information done, I was happy to pick this modest size cushion based on its features.On with the review and the features:1. This cushion has one of the primary needs for a seat cushion IMHO, that is an easily removable and washable seat cushion cover. Ding!2. This cushion has a carry handle, two in fact! Ding!3. This cushion is gel, and IMHO gel seem to survive far longer than any so called \u201cmemory foam\u201d Ding!(As if any memory foam seat cushion wants to remember its past! eww! ;)In this case, the gel initially seemed a bit thin, but a measurement shows 1 3/16 vs 1 4/16 for the old one. AND with the honey comb cell walls being much tighter at about 1/2\u201d apart, this construction seems even better. See blue gel photo.4. Letting this gel out of the bag/cover, does it smell, Ludo? A little, but not a real stinker! ding.5. And last for a chair cushion checklist today, does it fit? You will need to measure for yourself, in this case perhaps, measure that will NOT be under the gel of this cushion!Other observations. The ability to fold this cushion means that a particular one sided ailment might prefer this cushion. Or prefer the other side to have the cushion. And unlike most, this allows for folding to double up one side or the other. (Turn the other cheek? :) Hey! It could happen! If so, you got it covered!Bonus fun. Thinking outside the chair here: How about a recumbent exercise bike? And with the middle fold, perhaps a saddle bag build use. Could this work on some cycle? Or for the passenger on a motorcycle? And what does gel do with those \"vibrations\" there??",

He uses it mostly but when I'm on their computer chair you better believe I use this. The best thing about it is how good it feels. It's something about the gel that keeps it cool and also forms like a soft cushion on your seat. Definitely worth it.",

I had thought it might latch or strap over the back of the chair to hold it in place but it does not. Glad to have it, but it is not what was expected, either, for full seat cushioning.",
