Are you sitting comfortably? The key to making sitting enjoyable again is to relieve pressure in the correct places. MargGona memory foam cooling seat cushion features a U-shaped design and a contoured surface. At the rear of the cushion, there is a small cut-out, which leaves the coccyx, more commonly known as the tailbone, hovering over the sitting surface. This, in turn, eliminates any pressure from the surrounding areas. Layered over the memory foam is a padded sheet of cooling gel. This added feature helps keep users cool throughout the day in summer and adds an extra layer of comfort and cushion. The well-ventilated, mesh cover allows proper airflow so that users can benefit from this cooling feature all day.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I like this cushion but haven\u2019t found anything cooling about it as per the description. It\u2019s very comfy on the buttocks though!The cushion came in a cylindrical bag and it was amazing to see it regaining its shape one removed from the bag. Not sure how easy it would be to get it back into its bag though!The quality of the memory foam is good and it acts how you would expect it to. Springs back to its shape once not sat on which is great as I\u2019ve had some so called described \u201cmemory foam\u201dcushions and pillows that are just foam so do not act in the way one expects memory foam to act!I\u2019m currently using it on my office chair which has a back support as well as I suffer from chronic back pain. I do note that although very comfy once sat on it it did not stay insitu given the style of my chair which\u2019s faux leather seat and has an opening between the seat and the back support. It therefore keeps slipping to the rear of my seat so I have to hold my chairs handles which also has wheels before sitting down.I also use it for when I have to go to meetings in our meeting rooms which have very hard uncomfortable chairs and the memory foam really makes a difference as to how long I can sit down before my back starts aching.The cushion is very well made and would be suitable for cars, hard seats, and with the straps I would hang it on the handles of my suitcase when I go on holiday for those darned hard chairs at the airport.Wish it had been around when I had my surgery. Would have made sitting down post surgery which was very painful a lot more easier.I can only imagine how long it will last given how well it is put together.Very comfy and I\u2019d definitely recommend it.I hope you found this review helpful",
