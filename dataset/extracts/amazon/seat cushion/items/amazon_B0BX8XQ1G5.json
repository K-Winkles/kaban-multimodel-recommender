                "reviewText": "I am disabled. My doctor told me I needed a special \"pillow\" to sit on so my bed sore could heal and to prevent new ones from forming. I bought 2 styles, this one and an egg crate style with a back on it to go with the seat. I'm returning these very HARD seats and buying 3 more of the egg crate so I have 1 for the car and 1 for my electric cart and my wife liked the soft one so much she asked for one too!If you're looking for a firm seat, this one is for you. If you're bed ridden or can't stand very often and/or you've got a sore or two on the southern exposure, I would reconsider and go with the egg crate style.",

And usually no matter how much \"normal\" padding is on chairs, we still start to feel our butt bone digging into the hard surface. This cushion totally zero'd that out. Comfortable and cushy.
