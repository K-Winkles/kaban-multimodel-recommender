                "reviewText": "I recently bought these for my power wheelchair as I am in constant pain while using it. This combo back/seat cushion is far superior to the previous seat cushion I bought. It really has made a huge difference. I am plus size yet they both offer great support and the memory foam doesn't squish down to a pancake. It's not perfect, I still have pain but they allow me to sit for a longer period of time and in more comfort. BUT...I have only had these a short while and I saw that one of the straps on the back cushion is almost torn through already even though it isn't even a tight fit around the back of my chair. I am going to need to replace it even though it's been less than a month and I don't know how I will manage that because I absolutely need it every day and every time I sit. So if I return it I won't be able to use my wheelchair until the replacement arrives. If it wasn't for the ripping strap I would give 5 stars.",

The sides slope up slightly and that seems to keep the tailbone centered on the opening. Also the back is just slightly thicker than the front of the seat cushion. The fabric is smooth but not slippery. I am not constantly adjusting my position. It really is comfortable. I have an attic full of cushions for coccyx pain and back pain that made the discomfort worse, so I consider this one a real find!",

                "reviewText": "I drive for a living, sometimes driving for hour-long stretches. I have issues with my lower back tightening up when driving for long periods of time, and had been using a tennis ball to alleviate some pain. This seat cushion has helped significantly with a recent roadtrip from Washington state to Nevada. The padding is thick, but not too firm. It insulates heat, which sounds inconvenient at first. But I believe the heat helps with the lower back pain. I prefer to use the back cushion more than the seat cushion (the seat cushion shifts between seatings too much for my preference).",
