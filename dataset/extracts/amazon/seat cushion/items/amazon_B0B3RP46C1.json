                "reviewText": "I received the seat cushion on time, in nice packaging, and in perfect condition. The cushion color is a soft grey and it looks just like the picture. It is a firm cushion -- not a mushy cushion. It has a good design and constructed well. I plan to use it in my car in the driver's seat. I've bought three different kinds of seat cushions this week through Amazon for chairs I must sit in alot for work and to work at home in colors that coordinate with the chairs. If you are experiencing chronic pain in the bum area, you should think of buying seat cushion to relieve the pressure. I could not find anything made so nice as the ones recently bought through Amazon. The cushion has rubber bump on the bottom of it so it does not move arount when it is sat on. Earlier this summer I bought a medical seat cushion from our local pharmacy store because I needed something in a hurry, but later on found it hard to sit on and it rolls around in the chair which I cannot stand. I hope my comments help another person to decide what they need.",

Prior to using this cushion I was getting pains in my hips from sitting long hours in my chair. Those pains are gone. My sister even asked me to order her one after i told her about it. After 2 months, it seems to be holding up well, doesn't appear to be any flattening. And best thing is that it was $20 cheaper than the well advertised brand!",
