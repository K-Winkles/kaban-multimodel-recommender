This has a nice rubber bottom to it so it does not slip and slide all over the seat. The memoryFoam hugs my bottom, giving great support! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product. I would recommend this seat over any other. Great product and great buy!",

                "reviewText": "I homeschool and use a kitchen table as the school desk.I bought this cushion because I have a deteriorating SI joint and sitting for even a short time cause's me considerable pain.I bought this size cushion thinking that it probably was better to have the cushion a little too big than too small.Recently I have lost a good deal of weight but I still have more to loose so I figured extra large would probably be best choice. I wish I had not made that choice. (for reference I am 5'3\" and 170lbs)-The area cutout to relieve pressure on the coccyx bone takes a lot of intentionality to make sure it alines with my coccyx bone.-The cushion is too large for the chair and constantly is sliding back under the back rest and sideways off one or the other side of the chair.-I figured the cushions curve at the back would keep it aligned with the matching back rest and stop it from sliding under. It did not.-I also figured the curve would add more pressure relief to the coccyx bone area while being more supportive over all. I think it does, it would just be a lot better if it was a smaller size for me.*The cushion does help with pain relief and prevention if everything lines up properly. I think I personally just need the smaller size.",
