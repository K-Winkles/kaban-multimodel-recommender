The cushion on my home office chair sucks, but it was expensive and it's a pretty new chair, so I'm not just getting rid of it.No butt pain after using this cushion all day. Doesn't slip or slide around. Folded in half, it fits in the bag I always use as a carry-on on flights. Can recommend.",

Recently had some back issues and this made sitting much more manageable. I actually purchased two of these, one for myself, and one for my spouse. The cushion has an easy to carry handle incorporated into the cover which is very handy. We take these with us when we travel and often use them at local eateries for improved seating. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the ComfortMax Memory Foam Seat Cushion while using my computer, and it\u2019s been a game-changer. This cushion, designed to be placed on a chair, offers exceptional comfort and support. Made from high-quality memory foam, it molds perfectly to the contours of my body, providing relief and reducing pressure on my lower back and hips.The ergonomic design is especially beneficial during long hours of sitting in front of the monitor. It helps in maintaining a good posture, which is crucial to avoid any strain or discomfort. The cushion\u2019s cover is soft and breathable, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t get too warm after prolonged use.Another great feature is its non-slip base, which keeps the cushion firmly in place on the chair. It\u2019s also lightweight and portable, making it easy to move between different seating areas as needed.The cushion has a durable build and is easy to clean, thanks to its removable and washable cover. It\u2019s a fantastic investment for anyone who spends a lot of time sitting, whether for work or leisure. The ComfortMax Memory Foam Seat Cushion has significantly enhanced my overall experience while using my monitor, and I highly recommend it.",

I'm looking forward to when I can use it in the studio behind the video camera this weekend. The studio doesn't have the funding to purchase new chairs as of yet so this cushion will be a great help until the management can afford to buy new chairs for the video camera crew.",

I was having shoulder, neck, tailbone, and lower back pain. My doctor suggested I try one of these. I no longer have lower back or neck pain. Shoulder pain is better but still a little bothersome. I think it is the way I type, not my posture ... anyway ... This cushion is great! It stays thick even after hours of sitting on it and the grippers on the bottom keep it from sliding on my leather chair! Absolutely has helped with my posture, too! It worked so well, I ended up with a full-length back support cushion for my chair too, and the two together have significantly decreased my Tylenol intake! If you spend multiple hours a day sitting and are experiencing tailbone, lower back, and/or neck pain - I highly recommend giving this a try!",

Before it flared up this bad and I realized something was wrong it was mildly uncomfortable and I ordered this cushion hoping for relief hoping it\u2019ll go away on its own. It did help to an extent, it takes the pressure off my tailbone which is very helpful, but because the nerve pain is affecting my whole right leg it doesn\u2019t magically make it better and I\u2019m still uncomfortable. But I can sit significantly more comfortably for a longer period of time. I\u2019m hoping as I recover I\u2019ll be able to appreciate this cushion more.When I was still able to work I toted this guy with me, the handle makes carrying it around a lot easier and my coworkers love it, I have to ask for it back several times \ud83c\udf1dI think getting a better chair to have underneath will help, I\u2019m realizing I need lumbar support more than anything else but this is useful regardless",
