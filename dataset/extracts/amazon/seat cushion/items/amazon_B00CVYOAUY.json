                "reviewText": "The seat of my computer chair is so worn down, I can feel the plastic coming through so I tried several seat cushions until I found this one. I love that it doesn't have a hole in the middle, the cushion is soft enough to not cut off circulation but firm enough to provide cushioning between me and my chair. It's 2 layered, the top layer is really soft and cushy and the bottom layer is firmer. You can take off the cover and wash it. Has a handle on the back for easy traveling and grip on the bottom so it doesn't slip and slide. One complaint is I do think they could taper a bit more at the front, it's a bit too steep for my needs. I think if it continues to bother me, I'll shave a bit of the foam off so it's more tapered. So far, very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to cover the too firm office chair cushion I had suffered with for longer than I care to admit. After using everything in the house to sit on including pillows and folded comforters of various materials and thickness, I gave up and started shopping. After researching a couple of days, which always includes reading many reviews on various styles and materials I decided this cushion looked like it fit my needs the best.The material is foam/memory foam that has enough thickness to fully support a 200 lb. man. After using it daily for several months and hours at a time it has retained its original shape with only a slightly noticeable glute-shaped impression in the foam. Instead of being too soft that is squishes down to nothing and gives no lasting comfort, it seems just right and must truly be made from furniture quality foam.In order to keep the removable and washable cover in pristine condition a folded towel is placed over it. So far washing it has not been necessary and there is no unpleasant smell from the materials. The size is perfect for the average/standard office chair seat cushion, it covers mine completely. This is a 'true wellness' office chair from Costco by the way.All my issues with the chair were solved by adding this cushion, however it is so comfortable now that I don't get up and move around as often as health professionals recommend. (still working on that :-) I feel kinda lucky that I found something that worked on my first try. That doesn't happen too often.There is no floaty feel like some people have reported from the gel type cushions. For someone like me who has trouble sitting on a variety of chair types for any length of time this has been a great find. My rear and lower back do not get sore from extended sessions of browsing, writing, or gaming and so I must recommend this cushion wholeheartedly. If you get it I hope it helps you just as much. Cheers.",

                "reviewText": "I'll be honest, I got this to try and bring new life back into an old desk chair and make it a little comfier. The chair is comfier with the cushion than without, but it's not that big of a difference. Other reviews say this cushion smashes down flat, and it's true. After sitting on this cushion pretty much every day for a few weeks, it's pretty dang felt. But there is still a little bit of cushion left to it, and it is comfier than sitting on my old desk chair where the original seat cushion is non-existent. I also had to turn the cushion around to sit on it properly. I have the sloped part facing into the back of the chair and the handle side facing out. If I put it with the handle side facing in, it felt like I was getting tipped out of my chair due to the angle. This cushion is comfy enough, but don't expect it to stay as puffy as it does on day one straight out of the package. I'm also a heavier person, and it does hold up underneath my weight, even if it is very compressed when I sit down on it.",

                "reviewText": "I spent about a month testing nine different seat cushions to try and find the best one for me. Overall, this was an ok option, but not what I chose to keep. Here are some quick pros and consPros:+ Low price+ Doesn't make a weird noise when you sit on it like the thicker \"Purple\" brand name models+ Case is of higher quality than other generic / budget models+ Foam has a reasonable contoured design that slopes in front taking some pressure off your thighs, and a curve in the back that will complement most office chairs+ Great option if you need a \"boost\" in your chair (you want to sit up higher)Cons:- Not particularly comfortable - The foam is actually mostly a \"regular\" foam and not memory foam when you take it out of the case.- If you *don't* need a boost, this can affect the ergonomics of your chair in an unhelpful way. Eg I'm tall and this made the lumbar support of my chair hit too low on my backIf you're looking for a memory foam seat cushion, I'd recommend the Milliard Memory foam instead, which is true memory foam.For a more in-depth comparison and recommendation, I posted some videos on YouTube you can find. Search for \"TravelMate Extra-Large Memory Foam Seat Cushion Review (on Aeron)\", which provides a more detailed assessment of this seat cushion and includes links to many other videos to help you make the best decision. My actual recommendations can be found at, \"Best Seat Cushion for Your Office Chair - 3 Recommendations\" and I also have prepared some tips for making your choice at \"How to Choose a Seat Cushion for Your Office Chair\"HTH",

                "reviewText": "Just saved me 300 bucks buying a new gaming chair. Bought a cheap gaming chair, the butt cushion sucked since day one. Finally decided to get a cushion. I bought a few different ones after reading through the reviews. This is much better than the other memory foam type cushions which just get hard within minutes of sitting. This cushion keeps its support and comfort for hours. The non slip bottom works perfect, it never moves or shifts. I've had them all for about a week, I'm keeping this and sending the others back.",
