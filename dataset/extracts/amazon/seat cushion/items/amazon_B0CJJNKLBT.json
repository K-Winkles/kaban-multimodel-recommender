You will still stick to it if you sit down wearing something short. The waffle design helps to prevent sweating. I think the current price point of $17 is high. It does come with a plastic air pump, but I also noted it was impossible to air it up by mouth. It is designed to prevent unwanted air loss, though.",

                "reviewText": "This seat cushion comes with a pump, which I immediately used to inflate it. It takes quite a few pumps to inflate the cushion to the desirable level. Once inflated, it provides very good cushing that is saving my tailbone and thighs from being compressed to the point of pain or numbness.The plastic is stronger and thicker than I expected. The nozzle closes tightly and does not allow air to escape even after sitting on these for a long time, and I have sat on these for hours at at time at my desk.One thing to be aware of is that the pump is small, and the back part comes off while pumping unless to press it down with one hand as you pump with the other hand. The tip stays in place in the nozzle while you use both hands to pump in the manner I just described.Overall and excellent product and cushions quite well. I hope it doesn't tear or develop a leak and will provide an update if that happens, but so far, not yet despite long hours of continuous use.",
