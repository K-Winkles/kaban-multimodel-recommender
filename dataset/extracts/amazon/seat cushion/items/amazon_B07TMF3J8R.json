                "reviewText": "I purchased this product because I work sitting on a hard chair surface, and I've been experiencing uncomfortable pressure on my tailbone and pelvic bones. I first tried another product which was a thick foam cushion, but that was too thick and rigid for me so I returned it and purchased this one. This product is extremely comfortable. It is a perfect thickness and it is soft and airy, with a really nice light, squishy, bouncy feel. The pressure on my tailbone and pelvic bones is really relieved. It feels better to me than the thick cushions with a cutout under the tailbone. I like the washable cover. The anti-slip markings are nice but there is still a little bit of movement and bunching up, so I occasionally have to adjust it. I really am very happy with this product. My only concern is that it might flatten over time, but that remains to be seen.",

                "reviewText": "I use this cushion to give rear end a break on our hard chairs. I'm a fairly small and lightweight fellow, but after many decades on this earth I need more creature comforts than in my youth. This honeycomb cushion is different from foam cushions. The cell structure reminds me of the crumble zones in packaging, crash barriers, etc. The honeycomb pad deforms quickly when you sit on it, then stabilizes almost instantly, unlike foam pads that feel softer at first but continue to compress as you sit on them. To me, it also feels a bit better ventilated and cooler than foam pads. Based on my experience with the pad over these past few months, I think the design probably loses its effectiveness for individuals over about 150-160 pounds, since the honeycomb structure would completely crumble and therefore lose effectiveness beyond that weight. One big plus is that the material rebounds instantly and fully when you stand up; unlike foam, it doesn't seem to wear out and lose its cushioning ability over time. Bottom line: This pad isn't a miracle, but the honeycomb design with gel material allows me to sit on a hard wood chair for hours at a time, unlike foam pads that lose their spring in much less time.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this seat cushion because during the pandemic I've been working from home. I sit on a kitchen chair that is wooden with no cushion. My tailbone started to complain and so I looked for something to help. I'd seen these type of cushions at Bed, Bath and Beyond and I'd tried sitting on one before so I knew they were comfy. I looked on Amazon and was thrilled to find one at a good price...Here's my opinion after using it for a while:1. If this is double-thick, I'd hate to see 'single-thick'... This seat cushion is approximately 1\" tall.2. It is more comfortable than sitting on the straight wood all day. I think it could definitely be more comfortable if it was thicker.3. You get what you pay for (I'm kicking myself right now for cheaping out).4. It's durable... It may not be the comfiest but it is handling 40 hours/week of sitting and hasn't changed form since I got it about 6 weeks ago.Overall, I am giving it 3 stars because I feel like it's satisfactory for what I paid for it. If you are looking for true relief, spend a little more money on a thicker pad. If you just need a little cushion, this will do fine.",

Personally, I prefer one of the \"net chairs\", though (including a net at the bottom, not just the back). It gives better airflow. But a whole different price category and for a collage room you still need to store the original chair somewhere to return it.",

NOTE: This seller keeps spamming me to remove my negative review in exchange for $40, which violates Amazon\u2019s Seller Terms of Service. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! This cushion promises you can \"sit on an egg without crushing it.\" However, when I took the cushion out of the box, it was so flimsy it flopped everywhere. Then I placed it on a hard surface (which is what I needed the cushioning for), and immediately the cushion went 100% FLAT. Zero cushioning whatsoever.I've never done a video review before, but in this case I felt it was necessary to demonstrate how utterly useless this product is. The \"gel\" material is about as flimsy as those gummy hands kids get out of gumball machines, the kind that stick to the wall. In fact, gummy bears have more cushioning than this cushion!Don't waste your money. This one's going back.UPDATE 03/27/23: Just received an email from the seller asking me to *delete* my negative review.",
