                "reviewText": "I did not know what to expect when I purchased the Coccyx Cushion. The lower back pain I experience can become so intense throughout the day that I decided it certainly could not cause more pain.I work on a computer network five to six days per week. The hours of work per day varies from eight to twelve depending on what I encounter and needs immediate attention. Thus the priority for me was placing the Coccyx Cushion on the chair at my desk.The continuous battle against the pain in my lower back and long hours worked per day, wears me down physically, emotionally and mentally. These factors combined are exhausting! Relief comes in the form of going straight to bed at the end of the day.Sleeping is an escape from the pain, and necessary for me to have any stamina the following day.I was not getting to spend much time with my wife in the evenings - but she understood, and we just made it work.The only thing that I have changed in the past six months is the purchase of the Coccyx Cushion. The first time I sat down on the cushion, I felt comfort from the design\u2026as if it was made specifically for me.When I was twelve, I fell off a skateboard straight down onto my tailbone - Coccyx. I broke the Sacrum which contains five (fused) vertebrae (S1-S5). The Sacrum vertebrae are directly above the Coccyx which is made up of four vertebrae. Three of the vertebrae are fused. The Sacrum vertebrae are directly below the Lumbar vertebrae \u2013 of which there are five (L1\u2014L5).A spine specialist has reviewed my X-rays and MRI. During a consultation, the spine specialist along with a neurosurgeon informed me that surgery would not be an option in this case due to the proximity of the break to my spine. They showed me the MRI, the break in the vertebrae and the proximity to my spinal column.It was shocking for me to see how close I came to something far worse than lower back pain. Now, if the pain becomes extreme, I remind myself that paralysis from the waist down could have been the result if the break had severed my spine.The Coccyx Cushion provides me with indescribable relief. The design consists of a gap that allows my spine NOT to be in contact with anything below the cushion. The mere fact that my spine is not in compression against something solid (the surface of a chair) is what provides me with such incredible relief.I am so glad that I followed my curiosity to try the Coccyx Cushion. It provides me so much relief that I purchased a second cushion. The second cushion makes it possible for me to take it with me and place it wherever I choose to sit. With this option, driving or riding in a car has become a much more comfortable and tolerable part of daily life.Today, I no longer need to take the maximum dosage of acetaminophen/day. I rarely think about acetaminophen! Taking less acetaminophen pleases both my doctor and my wife \u2013 the damage of taking too much acetaminophen can cause severe liver damage.If this all sounds \"a little too good to be true\" I would entirely agree with you...IF I was not experiencing the pain relief myself.I have no affiliation with anyone connected with the concept, design, production, sales or business marketing of this product.I am not receiving any compensation from anyone for this review. I am sharing the facts as I have experienced them personally. I provided this review for those who choose to seek the relief that this unique product can provide.",

I will purchase another one for my car. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you",

I initially bought this cushion back in 2018 and it did lose some of its firmness over time but it was not until now that I had to replace it. Make sure you do register the cushion once you receive it as they do honor the lifetime warranty and replaced it for free for me.",

                "reviewText": "Butt cushion Day 1: Not happy. I didn't have pain in my tushy until I used this cushion. Every time I sit on it for a little while at my desk, my tushy starts to hurt and I have to get up and move around. This does not normally happen when I sit in my office chair. I thought the extra cushion would be a nice addition, but on Day 1 I'm hating it. I will give it some time and update my review if I have different results.Rating: 1 Star.Update Day 5: I tried multiple times to use this cushion according to the pictures given. Every single time it caused me pain. I took a break from it. Then I turned it around, so the empty section is in front instead of in back. Now I can sit on it without experiencing pain. This is usable and I get a little bit of cushion but I still have to figure out my proper placement on the cushion each time I use it.Plus: the sitting side of the cushion is super soft to the touch, and the cushion doesn't slide around on the chair due to the texture on the back side of it.Rating: 3 Stars",
