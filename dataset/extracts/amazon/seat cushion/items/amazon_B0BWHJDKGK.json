I used the second memory foam pad for my desk chair and it feels firm. The size is perfect for both of our chairs and it's nice to be able to wash the cover and replace in no time flat as it's a fast drying material.I had a difficult time deciding if I should get a gel type or the memory foam, but I believe the memory foam pads meet our needs just fine. I think we'll try the gel cushions next time around.",
