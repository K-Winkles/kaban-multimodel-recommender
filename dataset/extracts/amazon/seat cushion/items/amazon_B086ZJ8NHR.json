I wanted something soft and comfortable but not too soft that it would squish down and not give me the boost I needed. This cushion does the trick. It\u2019s wide enough and very soft but lifts me just over 2 inches so I can see over the steering wheel more easily. I\u2019m sure after lots of use it\u2019ll squish down but this definitely helps right now. I also tried a more standard wedge type cushion which made it a bit easier to reach the foot pedals but didn\u2019t raise me up enough. With this cushion I can adjust the seat forward and still reach the pedals easily. This one also doesn\u2019t slide and I do have to do some wiggling to get seated right when I get in but that\u2019s to be expected with a giant cushion on top the seat.Bottom line, this is a giant squishy seat that\u2019s great for us shorty drivers.",

The design also has grooves that would suggest that it supports you in a stable position like a car seat. It's so squishy that this is not the case. I actually feel somewhat unstable sitting on it. If you're looking for softness, this may be a good choice. However, if you need more additional height and stable support, this may not be the perfect choice.",

With Stenosis, Spondylitis, Sciatica and S shape Scoliosis. This cushion actually feels like it helps circulates the blood flow in my pelvic and inner thighs. I cut 5 acres of farm lawn, it has many bumps. I use to have a difficult time walking afterwards so I dreaded cutting grass. With this cushion I don't have those problems. Now I look forward to cutting the lawn just so I can sit on the cushion. I recently purchased 2 more cushions to have in the house. I am hoping this seller is able to get the Lumbar cushions back in stock again. ***** 5+ Star ***** Excellent",

                "reviewText": "This cushion is so ridiculously bad, it's hard to know where to begin! It arrived promptly but that's where the good stuff ended. When I took it out of the box, it was awkwardly folded in half like the thickest taco you've ever seen. A day later it was still curled up that direction and we had to force it flat on a chair in order to even test it. And it was SO UNCOMFORTABLE AND TINY!From the description it seemed to me that this was a cushion specifically designed for larger individuals of higher-than-normal weight, with latex instead of memory foam, more dense and extra tall so it wouldn't flatten out when sat upon by larger folks. I have a latex mattress topper that I adore, so I thought maybe this was the answer to my hopes: a squishy but firm chair cushion that wouldn't just bottom out as soon as I sat down like memory foam ones always do. Here's the rub: they got the dense and tall part right.... just not the other two dimensions!Unlike their photos, and unlike the other user photos, the cover felt loose, like it was designed for something larger and now this latex piece was slipping around in there. So it feels unstable as soon as you sit down because it all might slip out of place within its own cover. Additionally, it's incredibly small in both width and depth. So as I sat down, not only did I feel like I'd slip, but also I felt like I would literally TIP OVER SIDEWAYS IN MY CHAIR! What the heck? So there was really no way for me to get comfortable at all in the dang thing. NO THANKS!I'd say the only thing it's good for is as a booster seat for a short, small person trying to drive a giant car.",

It doesn\u2019t loses it\u2019s shape or spring of the cushion no matter how long you\u2019ve been sitting on it.
