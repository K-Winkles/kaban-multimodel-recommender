The waffle is too flat, the air valve step won\u2019t close in, so it pokes up, and because it doesn\u2019t fill up well, it is almost completely flattened when I sit and does not relieve pressure -which is what it is meant to do.3) the instructions are 100% in a foreign language\u2026no English. I tried to fill this, using common sense. I can\u2019t imagine that I filled it wrong, but there\u2019s no way to know because I couldn\u2019t read the instructions. Very disappointed by this!",

You have to blow it up with your mouth by pinching open the valve you are blowing in. They do not send you the part for the pump to blow it up. But, it's very easy to blow up quickly. You can adjust how much air you want in the cushion. For a wheelchair, I didn't blow it up all the way and it was very comfortable. I would recommend that if you're short, to make sure that the pillow is set all the way back. It's a strange concept and doesn't seem like it would be comfortable, but it is for me.",

                "reviewText": "This is useless! Unfortunately, I purchase this two times for my elderly mother! The pump for the first one broke quickly. It took forever to inflate and w leaked air needing to be reinflated at least daily.The new one arrive today! Again, the pump broke this time before I could even get it inflated. I blew it up with my mouth. But there is already leaking out.This should just go in the trash, but I\u2019m going to return it. There will not be a third purchase.",

This was purchased for the car as he could only sit on the seat for about 10 minutes before being in pain. It was easy to inflate and you can regulate how soft or hard the cushion is. We can now go on longer car journeys, best purchase I've made highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The cushion does alter the seating position for patients who are sitting long term and it's been successful in relieving the pressure of being in a chair or bed for long periods. It is inflatable and it's important to play around a little with pressure to ensure that you find a comfortable middle ground between too soft and not supportive and too hard which can indent into the skin. It's not at all \"premium\" in feel - it's the quality of a swimming armband - but overall I'm happy with it and its performance.",
