                "reviewText": "Used this for a week in disney with my 7 year old. The stroller was great. The shade worked great, until it was time to fold the stroller with it attached. The shade would not fold flat with the stroller. After 2 days of holding it flat while folded it wore the plastic down enough it would fold flat and stay without me holding it. This also allowed me to fold the shade down behind the seat at night or while indoors which let me see directly in front and maneuver easier. All in all a great addition and well worth it.",

I got a replacement because the first one was no way to put the tiny straw through I hurt my hand multiple times trying and so did my family members when they attempted to help me. Just the fact that you have to put a STRAW in a stroller shade is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve had to do. I had the same problem with the replacement and eventually got them into both sides and it STILL LOOKS HORRIBLE. I need a canopy for this stroller either way and now I have to use it when it looks horrible. This company should do better. I didn\u2019t really like the stroller either since I have to hurt my hands just to open and close it and now this?! I would like a full refund!",
