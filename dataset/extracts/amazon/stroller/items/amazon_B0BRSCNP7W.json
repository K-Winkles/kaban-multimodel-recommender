Compartment zips open to allow a contained changing station or a nap area for the baby,, phone charger for mom, stashed diapers, blanket, bottles, wipes, all the stuff you need and compartmentalized to easy access to everything. Much more practical for a mom on the go instead of a bulking diaper bag. They are the bomb!",
