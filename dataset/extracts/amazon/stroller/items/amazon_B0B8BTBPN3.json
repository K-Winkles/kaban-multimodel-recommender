                "reviewText": "This stroller arrived quickly and well packaged with all parts and pieces present. The stroller is relatively easy to put together especially if you have had experience with these kinds of items in the past. It has a variety of really nice features that make traveling with your kiddo more enjoyable. You can adjust the hand bar for parents to the desired position, and the toddler foot rest is adjustable as well. It drives so incredibly smooth, which is one of the reasons I love this and it handles well on various different terrain and flooring. The seat is able to be flipped around so you can do forward or rear facing and it can be folded up easily in either position. The other great feature is that you can swap it out to use with the matching car seat or cot if you so choose to get them, giving this stroller that much more longevity. There is ample under seat storage for large diaper bags or if you\u2019re shopping downtown and need somewhere to keep some bags. The price point is on the high end but you are not just buying a stroller, it is a convertible stroller which is so useful. Overall, this is a fantastic product that would work for any gender and seems to be comfortable for both parent and child. Would recommend.",
