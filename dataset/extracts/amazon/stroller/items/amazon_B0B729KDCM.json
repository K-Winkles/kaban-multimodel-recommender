I\u2019m taking my 3 and half year old child (40 lbs 40 inches tall) on a 30 hours international trip back to my hometown in China. I was looking for a travel stroller that is 1) compact enough to fit in overhead bin, 2) light weight for me to hold single handed, 3) easy smooth folding, 4) allow my big boy to sit and sleep in it comfortably; 5) doesn\u2019t break my bank and doesn\u2019t look like a flimsy piece of sh\u2026.I did so much research and bought 3 strollers for my price range to compare: this one, Munchkin sparrow, and Harppe (or some random Chinese brand that only sells for a season on Amazon). This one wins hands down in every aspect, very solid structure, well made with good materials, easiest pushing and folding among all 3, even has a very functional sun shade, unlike a lot of strollers on the market, the shade is basically a decor\u2026 If you are looking for a travel stroller for similar reasons, this is IT!",

                "reviewText": "I really like this stroller! I bought it to guarantee it fit in all overhead compartments for all airlines, so my choices were this or the gb pockit. I read reviews that this one was slightly better than the pockit, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. I tested it on the streets of Rome and a few other European port cities. It handled well. People are typically afraid of cobblestones. The ones you find in populous cities are bumpy but if you have a good sleeper child, they will sleep through it. Might even be soothing. But, there are other cobblestone cities where the stones are different shapes and sizes, and those are probably going to be difficult for any travel stroller.About the stroller - small bottom storage but good enough for a few items, not a full recline but it\u2019s enough for child to sleep and lean head on inner fabric, not a one handed folded but still pretty easy to do quickly, canopy could be bigger but always covered my toddler\u2019s face. I\u2019m probably not doing well advocating for this item, but it seriously did all the things I needed it to and didn\u2019t break. I call that a win.My toddler was 21mo, 33\u201d tall, and about 25lbs at time of travel.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this like 1.5 years ago, I do t have time to write reviews but I purposely have gone back to do it. I bought it for my then 1.5 year old, he is 3 now. We took it to many airports, all sorts of trips to all over. I can flip it out with one hand and fold it up with him standing right by me. When it\u2019s folded it fits in overhead, even though every steward says \u201cyou\u2019ll have to check it\u201d then I file it and they are like \u201cthat\u2019s amazing!\u201d I can carry it with one hand and child in other no problem, fits on bus transport, subway, etc. Pushing it is easy for my mom, she needs a cane to walk but this substitute\u2019s for her. I go through the airport pushing it with one hand, car seat over shoulder and roll on bag in the other hand. My son finds it comfortable enough\u2026 he does slouch in it and always has so not for a child younger than a year old. Yet, he has slept and rides in it just fine. Enough space underneath for his snacks, diapers, sunblock, my water bottle etc. there is no cup holder but I\u2019m not a coffee drinker so it does not bother me at all. If you are going to travel you have to buy this! Best thing I ever bought as a mom.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is great- light weight, small, easy to unfold/fold (easier than the GB Pockit all terrain), the sun shade works well and is sturdy.My 3 complaints1- it would ideally recline more and I think all they would need is to put a just a few more inches of fabric on the sides (maybe 4-5 inches) and extend the recline strap (I think this combined would be less than 1 lb of added weight and would be well worth it.2- No cup holder for parent or baby- but this is easily remedied by many options for added storage- I ended up with \"Belle on the go\" from BuyBuy Baby. Its a soft neoprene material and it doesn't get in the way when folding up.3- the BIGGEST Fault is that there are not any conversion kits for other brands of infant carriers- if so this would end up being my only stroller and I'd get rid of the other big stroller I got from Graco- as it lays currently- I am not going to spend $300 on a single infant car seat when there are others that have just as good if not better safety ratings for cheaper.Anyways- We have had this about 2 weeks and took it on vacation and loved it. my 18 month old loved it. So it seems to be comfy the basket carries quite a bit and I am glad I made the investment.",
