The first one that came in the wheel had snapped almost completely off before arriving. I was surprised because it is such a thick plastic. I had already unfolded it before I noticed and realized they do not fold back as well as the video shows. As sturdy as it is I fear snapping something trying to fold it. But for me it\u2019s for quick in and out situations with my little one and fits fine in an SUV unfolded same as the dream on me.",

                "reviewText": "This is not your average stroller and for what it is, I think it works well after having it for a while. It is surprisingly compact for a stroller and that can be so nice to have when in a small car. It is pretty easy to maneuver around, but at the same time, I do feel like the fit for my little one is not quite the same as a standard stroller and this feels like a high chair on wheels to me. But I mean, it seems hard to beat the compactness of this.",

The wheels rotate 360\u00b0 and have wheel locks. It works and does the job it should but it is basic. No storage spaces or under storage to hold the diaper.",
