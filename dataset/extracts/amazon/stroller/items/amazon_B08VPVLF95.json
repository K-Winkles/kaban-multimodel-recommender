The car seat is very sturdy and I feel my daughter is extremely safe in it. It also assembles easily and for the price, it\u2019s the best bang for your buck. We looked into many car seats and decided on this one and were extremely glad we did!",

                "reviewText": "There are soooo many travel systems out there, I truly agonized over which one to purchase. This was one of the more affordable ones I found, and I was between it and a similar graco model. So far I have been nothing but impressed with this stroller/car seat combo.Assembly was easy, quick one hand fold action, with easy but secure transfer ability from stroller to car. The stroller is quite tall, I am 5\u20199 and my husband is 6\u20193 and neither of us have to slouch over it. It folds up small enough to fit in the trunk of our tiny sedan, and both the stroller and car seat are fairly light! The last thing I will add (as this was something I stressed a lot about) is that the car seat is great for a newborn! It has built in cushion that keeps my baby propped up and secure, which I was a lot of complaints about for other travel systems I considered. I can\u2019t speak for the toddler seat yet, but it looks very nice and I look forward to trying that out eventually.Edit:My baby is 8 months old now, so few thoughts to add to this review.We now use the stroller without the car seat and the toddler seat is great. It reclines far enough back that I can actually change our baby in it if we\u2019re out and about.My only real complaint about this travel system is for the actual carseat\u2026 the handle on it has buttons you have to push in on both sides to move the handle. For a stroller that is made for the purpose of one hand actions, this design really didn\u2019t make sense. It is very unfortunate if you\u2019re driving alone and need it moved when you\u2019re in the front. Definitely not a deal breaker for me though.",

The base that it snaps into is nice makes it a lot easier to put in and out of the car. I like the stroller it does feel really solid and seems like it will not have issues getting stuck in grass etc. the only part that I worry about that feels a bit weak is the handle. There are times you need to wheely the stroller to get up curbs higher ledges and it does flex a bit I do worry that I will break it in half I'm not careful. But the rest of the construction is nice. A lot of padding and looks like everything will provide as much protection as I could expect.",

Would also be perfect for a spring newborn or somewhere it rains a lot.The adult cup holders and storage space on the handle bar was a must have for us, and it\u2019s something some of the other Chicco travel sets don\u2019t offer.",

Installing the bases in the car was a little difficult with one because the clips are thicker and it was harder to fit in one of the cars hooks. But overall the bases sit perfectly as well. We've now been using this with the newborn for a few weeks and we love it. Love how it folds easily to open and close. Love the extra large cargo space in the bottom, which fits my big diaper backpack. The stroller runs smoothly and the carseat clicks in and out easily.Definitely recommend this for anyone debating on getting it. It's perfect for our newborn and exactly what we wanted.",
