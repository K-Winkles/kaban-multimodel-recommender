However, It really hasnt been much of a problem! Still very handy!",

I have the Graco Snugride Click Connect 35 and it works perfectly with this adapter on my City Mini GT. The adapter was super easy to snap on to the stroller frame. It attached even with the canopy also on the frame. It took me a couple of minutes to find the right way to snap the carseat on, but once I found it, it was easy to replicate. (The adapter snaps right where the carseat handle attaches on either side).The adapter does not interfere with the one-handed fold of the city mini gt. The canopy on the stroller cannot extend all the way out with the carseat attached, but it does extend far enough to reach the carseat canopy so you can get full sun/rain protection.So glad to have found this and thrilled that it will eliminate one extra baby item from our house!",

                "reviewText": "What I love about this product is how easy it is to use with the Graco Snugride 35 car seat we have. It saved us from having to buy a separate infant/newborn stroller because now we can just click the seat into the adapters in our City Mini GT stroller and go! I love how it works so easily (and cheaply!). My one complaint is that sometimes the adapters are easily pulled out of the stroller when you click the carseat's handle to remove it from the stroller. There are times when I went back to put the carseat on the stroller, only to find the adaptors had come out of their sockets and were still attached to the carseat. I don't consider this a safety risk because it only happens when you apply your weight/pressure to actually removing the car seat from the adapters. Otherwise, the adapters work perfectly when the seat is clicked in. I have recommended this set up (stroller, car seat, adapters) to others because I love how easy it is to use! The City Mini GT stroller is a breeze to use and these adapters just make it even easier!",

                "reviewText": "The stroller is really wonderful, but it doesn't accommodate a new born; in order to use ANY car seats in the stroller, I'd need to install the right type of adapter. Since Graco car seats are more widely common and easier to find, I got these adapter ... took some time and patience to figure out but it's not rocket science. Now that the adapters are in, and I am using my Graco car seat, I am really happy with these adapters. Great product!",

Exceptuando ese detalle, lo recomiendo.",
