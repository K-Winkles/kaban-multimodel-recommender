With a spacious cargo basket and six storage pockets, you'll have plenty of room for all your gear and can keep your cell phone close-at-hand. The swivel-locking front wheel maneuvers easily through crowded streets and locks for stability when jogging while the reflective accents keep you safe on all your journeys (lunar black fashion is ultra-reflective).

                "reviewText": "We had a Bob single stroller that we used with our first child until she was 7 for big trips and vacations. It was the absolute best thing ever! When we had two more littles though we couldn't bring ourselves to spend this kind of money for the dual stroller. We bought several other tandum styles that we ended up returning for various reasons. None of them handled well with two kids, and most were bulky and awkward! We finally bought this one and are sooooo glad we did!! It handles like a dream and can turn on a dime! It's pretty narrow for a side by side and I found myself making it through openings I didn't think we would. The wheels are an absolute dream and can make it over ANY terrain and with ease! The seats are roomy and comfy. The underneath storage is fabulous. The height of the handles is perfect and ergonomic. The kids are up high and can see everything around them!! I mean I could go on and on!! Just buy it already!!",

Weight is a bit heavy, but worth it because the ride is so smooth and easy to navigate. We\u2019ve used it at Disney, zoos, parks, and countless other places. Difficult to get through some doors, but usually can find another entrance/exit to utilize. We bought the attachments with cup holders for us and the kids and it makes it so much better. Note: Buy extra tubes and hand pumps if you\u2019re on the trails!",

Folding it takes some practice, but it's not too difficult. It is a bit ungainly to put in my car, but again - which dualie jogging stroller isn't? I wish it had a brake, like my single BOB, for when I'm going down steep hills. Otherwise: love the amount of storage, my son's fit well in it, the shock absorption is EXCELLENT, and I'm grateful to have such a solid stroller for jogging on the trails.",

                "reviewText": "We live on a farm. We\u2019ve got a half paved driveway with mostly gravel. Rough gravel. Around almost the whole property. Then it\u2019s all mowed woody areas with creek beds and wildlife and dirt and mud and you name it. And this stroller rides over it all like a champ. The kids LOVE riding in it, they have taken many a naps at the zoo and I think Costco in it. It fits in those larger stores like Walmart but it doesn\u2019t in places like tjmax unless you want some awkward backing up situations with many glares thrown your way. It runs amazing, walks amazing, totes around lunches and water bottles, it can withstand mud and rain and it definitely makes this momma and these kiddos happy. I love the ability to really vent the seat when they lay down, the magnetic flaps on top are awesome, and the hand break is great! Just maybe not in a hurry, it\u2019s definitely a stop and think about it rather than a normal switch foot break. Definitely get the cup holder package, I didn\u2019t and have been tortured by trying to find a cheap one to fit on it, and that has been awful. Also, you can fit a lot of junk in the trunk but the junk has to be skinny enough to wiggle in there first, definitely not easy. Overall great ride.",

                "reviewText": "Ok this is seriously expensive for a jogger however it is worth every penny. It is effortless in pushing as it has bike quality bearings and tires. I really enjoy running and walking the twins now with effortless 10 mile outings. I have not had any issues with the tires as some have stated. The suspension is actually good and absorbs the bumps and uneven surfaces, glad to see this is not just a gimmick. The kids really enjoy it and are comfortable cruising along. The seatbelts are easy to operate unlike some others, we have gone through 4 strollers prior. Only down side is it is a little wide but that is expected with twin stroller. It is not intended to be a take to the store type of stroller, but for walks and runs this stroller is A+++",
