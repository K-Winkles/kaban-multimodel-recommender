                "reviewText": "Best stroller and investment ever! I have the bin single stroller as well as britax b-free single stroller and needed to upgrade to a double as I had a second son\u2026 was debating between many doubles but so glad I got this one! It literally glides like butter on the ground, regardless of what you\u2019re rolling on (concrete, dirt, grass etc) and also it feels like I am pushing air! It has no weight and I can easily go up and down hills without an issue or feeling heavy! I bought this vs the double bob given it has a hand brake (I like to rollerblade!) and also an infant seat adapter for my 3 month old. It seems easier to push then the bob, it\u2019s also less bulky and much lighter to pick up, it\u2019s very sturdy but Lightweight, and I know it will last us a few good years! I\u2019m excited to take my kids to the park and adventures everyday in this stroller! It fits easily through a standard doorway and I can see myself taking it everywhere we go, it\u2019s so nice, great looking and perfect! My son also likes the \u201cbig brother\u201d stand I bought with it which fits perfectly (2 years old), and he also loved the seat, it\u2019s comfy and the recline wasn\u2019t too far back at all, it was a good angle and he could see just fine! He likes the big shade over his head too.. it completely blocked the sun! Also we have no issues with the wheels wobbling! Be weary of the negative reviews, until you try this gem out for yourself! My friend also has one and calls it GOLD! It really is. Invest in a good stroller, invest in THULE! :-)",

                "reviewText": "I love this stroller so far. It's light and easy to push. It looks sleek and modern and many people compliment on how \"nice\" our stroller looks. I can easily push it with one hand. Running with it is a dream. Buying the console gives you good storage. My toddler likes the additional snack tray purchase. Sun shade is big. There's even mesh pockets on the sides of the seat so my daughter can store a toy or two next to her. There's a mesh pocket behind the seat. I forgot a banana in there, folded the stroller, and the banana was fresh and unbruised the next day. It's pretty easy and intuitive to adjust the seat straps.My only complaints are very specific to my needs/preferences (mostly that I want my jogging stroller to also be my every day stroller):1. The seat's most upright position is slightly reclined. My daughter wants to sit all the way upright and so she is hesitant to get in the stroller for this reason. I understand that this is so the baby doesn't get whiplash from sudden starts and stops on a run, but since I like to use this stroller for everyday errands, I wish it could go completely upright. I read that the 2016 BOB now includes a complete upright position, so I hope one day Thule does the same.2. The stroller feels very LONG. I brought this stroller to Disneyland and it just felt slightly too big...not because of it's girth or profile (which are very sleek), but simply because of the length. It takes careful thought to maneuver in tight spaces, though the actual pushing and turning is very smooth, light and easy.3. The placement of the back two wheels feel slightly WIDE when indoors (yes I took this into a restaurant) and in crowds. Similar to my last point...the silhouette of the stroller seat is slim, it's just the wheel placement that sticks far out in front and a little wide in the back. If I wasn't mindful, I would accidentally bump into things. I wonder if the wheel placement has something to do with the aerodynamics of the running stroller? If so I'm not complaining.My dream is that Thule (are you reading this Thule?) would consider a model with front and back wheels that sit more underneath the child seat instead of sticking out as much, and a more upright sitting position. Then this would be the ultimate only-stroller-you-ever-need-in-life stroller.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a jogging stroller with a brake that I could rollerblade with safely. [I'm not advocating using this for rollerblading, this is a don't-try-this-at-home kind of warning]The front wheel has a nice pseudo-lock mechanism to it so you can switch from walking/maneuverable to running/limited turning mode.The wheels are the perfect size, glides easily and silently.It seems very well made, the material has held up to the sun, the canopy and ventilation is great.The braking works well enough for rollerblading, you have to turn it pretty hard though. Wouldn't be able to stop you going down a hill if you had any speed.There have been complaints about the latch breaking when you lift it when it's folded, so I've been very careful not to put all the weight on the latch when lifting. I haven't had problems with it, but I could see how that could break if you weren't careful.The stroller folds up very easily (took a little getting used to though), and the handlebars adjust easily, which makes it very easy to fit in the trunk and adjust for height. That's very important because I'm both fairly tall (6') and when I'm on rollerblades I get another 4\". My wife is much shorter so the handlebars have a large comfort range.Next up is the storage area. No water bottle holder, but the storage base is very nice. It both has velcro for quick in and out and a zipper if you wanted to seal the whole thing up.Worth the price, using it every day!",

                "reviewText": "I give the Thule Urban Glide 2 Jogging Stroller a raving 5-star review! This stroller is an absolute game changer for active parents. It is designed for jogging and provides a smooth and stable ride for both parent and child. The stroller is lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it perfect for city streets or off-road adventures. The swivel front wheel allows for easy navigation in tight spaces, while the locking feature provides added stability when jogging. The adjustable handlebar and hand-operated rear drum brakes are a plus, giving me full control of the stroller at all times. The seat is also very comfortable and spacious, providing plenty of room for my child to grow. The canopy provides ample shade and the adjustable calf support is great for little legs. The stroller also has a large storage basket and a water-resistant phone pocket. Overall, I highly recommend the Thule Urban Glide 2 Jogging Stroller for anyone looking for a high-performance and versatile stroller for their active lifestyle.",

It is big and bulky and tough to fit in the trunk, but it seems like it would be worth it.The lifetime warranty is nice, however you must follow the rules in the instruction manual in order to qualify. Note the pictures I have attached. It is advertised as an all-terrain stroller, however in the first page of the instructions it says not to use the carrier on rough off-road terrain. How does that make sense? If they don't qualify this exactly, it gives an excuse for the manufacturer to void the warranty. In addition, it mentions in the manual that it is not for running... They need to define the exact speed limits between running and jogging. I am 6'2\", my wife is 5'2\". Jogging for me is running for her.We will likely return based solely on the fact that we have heard nightmares about getting Thule to honour warranty requests, and these loopholes written into the manual seems to give them the ability to squirm out of anything.",

It\u2019s light enough to be lifted with one hand, quality is great and the stroller looks really nice and very sleek. I highly recommend this for anyone who does a lot of walking and jogging but also wants something you can take into the grocery store or mall easily.",
