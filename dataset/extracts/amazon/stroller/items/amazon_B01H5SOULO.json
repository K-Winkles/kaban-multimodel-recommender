                "reviewText": "I had a stroller from Graco made 5 years ago when my son was born that I loved. And because I loved it, it was hard to find a replacement that was close enough to it that it made me happy. This one is pretty great.The basket is big enough that I can fit all manner of things in there for my 5 year old and my baby and myself (with shopping). The cup holders for the adults and the child are so, so nice. My last stroller had one cup holder for the child and the other was a curved opening for snacks, so the cup always got put into that one and then fell out on the dirty ground... This one just has two cup holders for the kid which is GREAT!! The canopy is really quite big so it covers the kid from the sun really well without having to rig up a blanket cover as well. And the stroller glides so nice and can make super sharp turns when you are trying to not run over your other kid who is acting like an animal in a small store aisle!The only thing that does kind of irk me is that this stroller doesn't have a lock once it is collapsed. It is nice for unfolding it quickly but it also unfolds when you don't want it to while trying to move it somewhere else... If you hold it by the strap inside the folding mechanism it doesn't do this, but if that strap breaks it would be hard to both carry it anywhere and also to fold it up anymore. And as we all know, the more you use something the more likely it is to break so I'd rather not carry the stroller around by that strap. I mean the strap is well made so probably won't break and you don't really move the folded stroller all that much, but it is still kind of a design flaw.Otherwise, the stroller is super great and definitely hit most of the points on this picky mom's checklist.",

It\u2019s light enough for me to carry a decent distance (even with holding baby) without my biceps burning, which also helps a lot. Great storage and overall for the price, absolutely worth the purchase so far.TIP: I purchased a \u201clike new\u201d condition item that was coming in different packaging than the typical shipping packaging and saved another $30. The stroller itself was perfectly fine. No scratches or damage on the actual product.",

                "reviewText": "As the mother of four young children (ranging in age from 6 years to 4 months) I have owned more strollers than I can count. This is by far the easiest, and possibly the lightest, stroller I have ever used. The weight is what sold me initially. I bought the Chicco Activ3 Jogging stroller just after our fourth baby was born hoping it would be the last stroller I ever purchased. It is horrible. So heavy I can hardly get it in my van, always pulls to one side, and has no storage underneath. I bought this last month after becoming so frustrated with how difficult the jogger is to use. This stroller has been wonderful. It is so light I can lift it with one hand. It folds faster than any stroller I've ever seen, and the car seat snaps in so easily. The storage underneath is wonderful. The three wheel design makes it so much easier to steer in aisles. I highly recommend this stroller!",

It\u2019s great for when baby is sleeping so he shouldn\u2019t wake up. It\u2019s super light and easy to fold, takes up very little space. Perfect for walks around the neighborhood. The large basket on the bottom, cup holders and storage pocket are perfect as well! Great product, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Love this stroller! Super easy to maneuver, lightweight (I am 5\u20195\u201d and 120lbs) and I can easily lift this into the back of my Mitsubishi Outlander. Very easy to fold and awesome storage capacity underneath. The tray and cup holders were a selling point for us, also. It looks very nice in person and is sturdy. The only two things that I\u2019ve noticed about it that I\u2019m not entirely in love with is the short seat doesn\u2019t seem like it will suit a toddler well (my daughter is only 8 months old now) and she would slide right out if she weren\u2019t buckled because of the weird angle? also, it isn\u2019t very padded inside. It doesn\u2019t seem very comfortable so we\u2019re looking for inserts of some sort. This is simple enough to use as an every day stroller and equipped for longer strolls or outings so no need to buy multiple strollers for us. We\u2019ve taken it into different terrains and it isn\u2019t bumpy, seems to ride pretty smoothly and it\u2019s awesome paired with the Chicco Keyfit type infant car seats. The hood works great and covers the infant seat completely without seeming as if it\u2019s suffocating baby in there, super roomy. The hood is smooth and doesn\u2019t get stuck. It\u2019s quiet and effortless to adjust at different intervals. The hood helped keep her warm in the fall and the sun out of her eyes on bright days. I also love that the hood opens from both sides so that baby can sleep without being disturbed when we peek in on her. Our daughter loves riding in her stroller. 4 stars because of the weird seat. Hopefully we can get past it because we loved this with the infant seat. Will update in a few months.",

I love how much storage space the basket underneath has and how easy it is to access it.If you travel with it, remove he tray and pack t in your bag!! Our tray broke off on a flight due to the airline not handling it very nicely and as such I could no longer use the car seat with it, but I ended up buying a second stroller since I\u2019m expecting again and can\u2019t live without this stroller when I have a newborn.",
