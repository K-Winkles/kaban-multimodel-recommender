                "reviewText": "I've include pictures with a bear that's about the size of a newborn, and then one of our 9 month old daughter with all the padding in and one with it taken out. The padding gives you a lot of adjustability, there's the grey insert that you can see, but there's also a foam wedge behind it that can help if you want to take up some slack in the straps.We haven't had a Britax stroller before but we do have a BOB jogging stroller and a Silver Cross Jet 4 and we really like both of them. This review will mostly be comparing the Britax Grove against our BOB and Silver Cross strollers. This Britax Grove fits nicely in between our big BOB jogger and our super portable Silver cross.If you haven't bought a stroller before make sure you pay attention to wheel size, if your stroller has really small wheels they will get hung up on all kinds of stuff. Totally fine if you're only planning on using it on super smooth surfaces, but if you have really tiny wheels you might get tripped up by small cracks in the sidewalk. Our Silver Cross Jet 4 has wheels that are small enough to be annoying if the going gets rough at all. The BOB jogger is a tank with awesome huge wheels that will roll over neighborhood dogs and barely feel it. The wheels on the Britax Grove are somewhere in the middle of the two, but I'd say they will handle 99% of normal urban environments very smoothly.One thing we noticed right away about the Grove is the simplicity of operation, everything was really intuitive. Assembling it when we first got it was straightforward and folding it down for storage is very easy and intuitive.The only negative that I have to say about the Britax Grove is that the connection between the seat and the frame has some wobble to it. It feels plenty secure to me, I don't think it's a safety issue, but when you get into this price point I'd expect a little bit more of a premium, tighter fit. I will say that one benefit of the looser fit is that it's really easy to remove the seat assembly and to drop it back into place. I don't feel that the wobble is a big enough factor for me to knock a whole star off.",

When you\u2019re lugging a baby around the last thing you want to do is fight with a heavy stroller! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Oh I love this stroller! I've tried just about every tier of strollers of the same kind, and this one is nice. Smooth ride, large back wheels, and I love that it tilts back so the baby can sleep.However, the stroller is not reclining per se. The whole piece tilts, but you can't adjust the angle of the back. Which is fine by me since I only even use two angles-sit up and lay down.I absolutely love the giant roomy basket at the bottom. It fits so much anf has plenty of space to actually put the bags in-as in you have enough gap between the basket and the seat to get the bags(or whatever you gonna put there) in and out. Super easy to fold and u fold. Expandable hood is a nice bonus-and you can use the peek window whether the hood is expanded or not.",

                "reviewText": "It is lightweight and compact, fitting easily into a sedan car. The wheels are of excellent quality, and the interior is lined with a soft material. It offers great versatility, usable in various directions. Adding small tools like sound music or LEDs would enhance its appeal for kids. Furthermore, incorporating wheel options to absorb weight and pressure would be beneficial, although it is already sufficiently sturdy for prolonged use.",
