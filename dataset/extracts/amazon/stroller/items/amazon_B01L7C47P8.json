                "reviewText": "I love this stroller! It's good on grass, gravel, bumpy terrain, and of course a smooth ride for everyday things like shopping. I like the extra storage of the parent bag and the convenience of the parent cup holders with storage in between them. I keep a compact bicycle pump and extra inner tubes along with feeding and diaper changing stuff in the parent bag and I keep the bug net in the little compartment between the cup holders. I don't like to be caught without everything I need! It's easy to turn and move around. I love that it has the tether so baby won't roll away if you fall and it's not attached to the handle where baby would go down with you. I definitely like the longer canopy and peek-a-boo window. The adjustable handle has been great for me because I'm short and now I don't have to reach so high to push it but everyone else is tall and the handle can be adjusted up for them in only about a second. I liked that it comes with the adapters for the different car seats so you have what you need. I love that the child's tray can swing around on either side. It has come in very handy for diaper changes on the go when there weren't any changing stations or they were so gross that I would never put my baby near it! I like the quick release back wheels and the lock on the front wheel to keep it straight for going faster that walking speed.Now what I don't like. I don't like that the seat doesn't sit up all the way and my son strains to see over the tray and sit up straighter. To fold this particular model, not only do you have to lay down the seat but you have to adjust the handle up if there is anything in the parent bag. I don't like that the bottom storage gets in the way of the front wheel when you're folding it and I have to turn the front wheel sideways to get the side latch to hook to keep it folded. The handle padding peels away especially if you bump it on the ground while you're folding it. I don't like the way the shoulder straps sit on my son, his shoulders come out of the straps if he wiggles too much but he is a small 8 month old. I just feel that it would be safer if it had a chest clip like car seats have to keep the straps in place. For the record he has never actually gotten a full arm out of the straps no matter how har he has tried, just the tops of his shoulders.Overall, I love it and I would recommend it to anyone else. It just has a few small inconveniences that I can live with.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5 ft tall and this stroller is perfect for me and still great for my 5\u2019 10\u201d husband. A jogging stroller I had returned in the past was very tall and I couldn\u2019t see over the canopy, this one is a very comfortable height and the adjustable hand bar makes it perfect for my husband as well. I got this stroller because our sidewalks are too uneven to use our regular Stroller and it was a nice price and compatible with our Chicco keyfit 30 car seat. It takes some wiggling and elbow grease to get the car seat in and out, but once you get used to it it\u2019s not a big deal. The storage is smaller compared to other strollers, but it\u2019s perfect for us using it to go on walks, it can still hold our jackets, and other things we may need. Overall perfect for what I needed.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this stroller to replace my 5 year old Graco jogger that I gave away thinking I didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately I was wrong so I ordered this based on the price and how it looked. So far the quality of the stroller seems great, the canopy is gigantic and it's very easy to maneuver. It really does exactly what it needs to do. When compared to the Graco, I like the style of this stroller better but the functionality is definitely lacking. The Jeep stroller requires 2 hands in order to collapse whereas the Graco only requires one. Another random flaw is that the Jeep's child tray doesn't have a single cupholder while the Graco child tray had 2! Now probably the biggest reason why I deducted a star from my review was because of the storage basket. I use an average-size backpack diaper bag and it just does not fit. I have to remove items and then force it into the basket while slowly destroying the bag itself. It was a nightmare at first but I've found ways to adjust to it and pack differntly. It's unfortunate that other than carrying my diaper bag, the Jeep basket is basically useless. My Graco basket was gigantic and allowed space for toys or shopping. Overall, yes the stroller is great for the price. If this is your first jogging stroller than go for it but if you've already owned the Graco then just stick to that brand.",

                "reviewText": "I have no vehicle and live in New England. I had to walk up a STEEP hill everyday to get my child to daycare. This hill is not a road just a path so unplowed. I had to carry the baby and my old stroller up that hill until I got this stroller. Nothing stops this stroller. It goes over snow, logs, rocks anything! My daughter doesnt bump around as much (on bigger obstacles she still does) I tried going over a 3in curb without lifting the front tire and while my daughter may have gotten tossed around a bit (shes 16m so she loved it) it did indeed go over without issue. If you're going down hill this stroller will try and fly down it.Other things I loved.1. Great storage space!2. Adjustable handle! I adjust it all the time.3. Locking front wheel. If going down stairs or through snow it is a life saver.4. Saftey strap. When going down steep or slippery hills I have the added comfort of knowing she wont go flying downhill if I have a fall.Cons.1. Bulky to store (but tires come off/on VERY easily)2. You have to recliner the seat all the way to fold it up.",
