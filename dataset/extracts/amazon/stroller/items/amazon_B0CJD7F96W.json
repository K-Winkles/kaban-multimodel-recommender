I wanted a stroller for my granddaughter, but I'm on a tight budget and don't have a big car. This one is ideal for what I need.It is a small stroller that is simple to assemble, fold, and store, and easily fits into my car. It's not a name brand, but it works well, is simple to use, secure, and reasonably priced. It keeps the infant safe and secure while rolling smoothly. I can easily take her with me when running errands, and she is much more comfortable in a stroller than in my arms or a buggy, so she can nap if needed.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this stroller for our baby because we were traveling to Disney with them. First day it went without any problems but we barely used it. However by the second day when we were pushing the stroller and lifted the two front wheels off the ground to go over a sidewalk, the stroller completely collapsed and our baby fell backwards inside the stroller. Being the only stroller we had, we had to use it for 4 more days and every single day we had the dame thing happen to us. The last one was at the airport and that time because the stroller was not being held by the rear handle it completely collapsed, bending our kid in half and resulting on him hitting the rear of his head against the floor. If I could give negative stars I would.THIS STROLLER IS A DEATHTRAP!",
