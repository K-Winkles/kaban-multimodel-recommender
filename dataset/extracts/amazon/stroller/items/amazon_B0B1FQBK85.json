                "reviewText": "The jogger concept is great and convenient and the fact that it is what airports call an umbrella type stroller/ one step fold away is perfect. But where it fails is in the quality department. The material is ok, in comparison to bugaboo or uppa. The wheels are an absolute joke, not meant for the wear and tear of a jogger stroller. The wheels are comparable to cheap plastic wheels you\u2019d see on a fisher price toy. Another factor is that the stroller wobbles for no reason. For the price it\u2019s decent but if I knew how cheap the wheels were I wouldn\u2019t have bought this stroller and the issue with wobbling. I\u2019m on the cusp of returning this I think.",

                "reviewText": "Manual wasn't super clear, I ended up finding a YouTube video for help. Also, I figured with the way the front wheel was designed that It would turn easy, but it's really stiff and you have to take very wide turns or pop a wheelie and pivot. Pros: it is very lightweight, doesn't take up much space when folded, and is perfect for my needs. The underside has a spacious basket, and it's less clunky and handles easier than the Graco stroller I had before",

My aunt gave me a stroller, it is good but it is big and too heavy. I cannot take it on and off the car, that's why I buy a new one. I really like the cover above the stroller because It can cover well no matter which the direction of the sunlight is",
