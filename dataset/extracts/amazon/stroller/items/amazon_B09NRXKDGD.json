The bumper bar doubles as the handle.Not as much big or bulky as a graco but still solid and lighter; does not feel flimsy at all. Baby is so comfortable in it. Falls fast asleep. The extendable/foldable part is handy so their legs don\u2019t hang. Does not lie completely flat but still good. Canopy is big enough to cover them and can extend when you unzip the peekaboo window. Adequate storage underneath and handy pocket behind. Cup holder included so it\u2019s very helpful. Not as small or light as a GB pockit stroller so it\u2019s not as travel friendly as it won\u2019t fit in overhead compartment but you can just check it in at the gate. Got a great deal for cyber Monday. We\u2019re very happy with it. Def recommend this. The green/blue is nice.",

                "reviewText": "I used this stroller as a step up from my Besrey one step fold infant stroller that I used for 3 years. It is bigger and heavier (with reason, as it is to accommodate more weight and size) so that wasn\u2019t too bad. It was perfect to travel (land and air) with. The only catch for me was that the wheels are tight and squeaky. I tried using WD40 but the problem persisted and there\u2019s no way to fix it.Overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons.Pros: color and material are good, easy to fold and unfold (as promised) and can be done with one hand, Convenient travel stroller, reclining seat, removable cup holder that expands to fit cup contours, good basket space, leg space can move up or down. Cons: front wheels squeak even when you use WD40 and they aren\u2019t as fluid in movement as past strollers (sometimes they need more of a nudge to turn and move)",

It also did not con with a rain cover. The main thing I would change if I could is the umbrella. When it is pulled all the way back it gets in the way of the handle. It also arches higher than the handle when pulled back which I feel like looks kinda weird. The front wheels do squeak but not all the time. It\u2019s also not the wheel that squeaks it\u2019s the part that allows the wheels to pivot for turning. The height is fine for me. I am 5\u20192\u201d and a lot of people didn\u2019t like the height but it wasn\u2019t that bad for me. Not a deal breaker. Again overall I do love it but like anything it doesn\u2019t check all my boxes but it does check most of them.",

                "reviewText": "I never really reviews, but I bought the stroller for less than $100 because so many of them get returned because of the squeaky wheel issue. It came to us in Like New condition. I'm going to guess because of the squeaky wheels upfront.As suspected when I bought it, it came with two squeaky front wheels. I put WD-40 on the wheel area and the problem persisted. I got down on my hands and knees and listened as my son sat in the stroller to listen to where the squeaking was actually coming from. The spot in the photo that is circled is where the noise was coming from. Added some WD- 40 to that area and boom, problem fixed!I do think an almost $200 stroller should come without squeaky wheels, but since I paid less than $100 for one that was brand new (returned, but obviously brand new) I'm not complaining about a simple fix.Hope this helps someone else!",

                "reviewText": "we\u2019ve been an evenflo gold family since day one and have always been so impressed with their products but this stroller was SUCH a disappointment. i took a gamble on the otto stroller and assumed that at worst, some 3D-40 spray would fix any squeakiness. to my surprise, the wheels didn\u2019t squeak! however, they did rattle and wobble constantly while pushing\u2014 even across perfectly smooth floors in a medical building. even after taking a look at the wheels when we got home, i couldn\u2019t find a way to tighten them at all to help with the rattling. additionally, the handlebar is SO tall! at 5\u20193\u201d, i realize that i\u2019m on the short side\u2014 our evenflo gold pivot xpand has an adjustable handlebar that allows both my husband (6\u20191\u201d) and myself to comfortably push it, but the otto has a stationary handle that i\u2019d venture to guess would be uncomfortably tall for anyone under 5\u20196\u201d or so. the basket is rather small which i don\u2019t particularly mind, but the configuration of the handlebar & seatback make it impossible to use any sort of stroller caddy/organizer (which, for me, is an absolute must when traveling). i also felt like the canopy itself was very wide & cumbersome looking\u2014 it extends past the sides of the stroller frame itself and looks rather awkward. the footrest also felt poorly constructed and provided very little in the way of leg support. while not an issue for my petite one year old, i would imagine that it may not work well for older toddlers/kids.disappointed to be sending this one back, but it just isn\u2019t the evenflo gold quality that i was hoping for.cons:-rattling, wobbly front wheels-very tall handlebar-no space to attach a stroller caddy/organizer-flimsy footrest-very wide and awkward looking canopypros:-easy to fold/unfold-nice fabric & finishes-lightweight and compact",

Previously used a mimosa cabin City+ and decided to get a larger reclinable stroller. Was expecting it to be as portable as the cabin city+ and alas it was not. Almost 3 kgs heavier and the auto fold did not make up for the bulkiness. Returned this and purchased the GB pockit plus instead and albeit more expensive, it\u2019s fitting the bill better.",
