Plan to use it for upcoming travel including a flight and cruise.In the meantime, I have used it at home and it is SO light and easy to use! We live in south Florida so the extended canopy is excellent with keeping sun off of my son. The handles are soft and nice to grip. Cell phone Pocket holds my iPhone max nicely. Wheels are easy to turn, overall the stroller is so easy to maneuver.The 5 point harness is simple with two clicks and he\u2019s safely in the seat. The seat feels soft and comfortable for him. The one handed lever on the back of the seat is easy to put into position and get to lay flat if needed. The peekaboo window is huge and allows for me to see him as well as allow circulation. The back storage zipper and bottom basket seems like they will come in handy as well.Honestly this will probably be my go to stroller for local outings as well with its ease of use !For reference, my son is 7 months and on the long side, about 29\u201d.",

                "reviewText": "Lightweight, easy to assemble. Absolutely amazing umbrella stroller. I am SO GLAD we switched over to this from our bassinet stroller. Baby can see everything and is super secure in a five point harness. I love that there is so much storage indent the baby. Way more than any other umbrella stroller I\u2019ve seen. Cup holder and phone holder are cute little add ons. There\u2019s a zipped part in the back you could put your keys or baby toys or dog toys, etc. best two parts hands down: 1. The sun shade goes almost all the way half circle and almost envelops the entire baby which helps in heat and cold. 2. The fact you can lay baby in so many different positions even all the way Down. My daughter who usually only nurses in order to nap. Will fall asleep laying in this stroller being pushed. Nice lengthy strong arms, you definitely don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re bending over to push the baby like with some cheaper models. Best purchase we\u2019ve gotten I think! Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller as something we could use instead of a tiny umbrella stroller and a huge jogging stroller. We have both and needed something more sturdy than an umbrella stroller and smaller and more lightweight than a jogging stroller for Disney and zoo trips. We took it on it\u2019s maiden voyage to Animal Kingdom on Wednesday and it did not disappoint!The shade created the perfect privacy for my almost 3 year old to take a good nap. It was about 85 degrees and the peek a boo window on the back of the shade provided ample breeze without jeopardizing the sun blockage. There are 3 seat positions, one being almost flat and perfect for a nap. My LO did just let his legs dangle as he was sleeping but at one point slept with them on the foot rest and on his side with them all the way up on the seat with him.I love that the child\u2019s cup holder is in the side of the seat making it harder for a different (and possibly sick) kid to just grab it. FThe stroller was super easy for LO to climb in and out of throughout the day to look at various things.I LOVE the basket underneath and the zipper pouch on the back. They both provided ample storage without making the stroller to big and bulky when folded. I also love the cup Holder and phone holder.The stroller was extremely maneuverable in huge crowds at Disney world and the handles are so y\u2019all! I\u2019m 5\u20195 and don\u2019t even come close to needing to bend over to push it. The stroller folds SO easily and is super light, perfect for traveling on the trams or monorails.I\u2019ve only used it once so I can\u2019t speak to durability yet but it seems extremely sturdy and well made.Best lightweight small profile stroller for the price, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I am beyond thrilled with this stroller! Let me just say I\u2019ve done my research and looked at several strollers before taking the plunge with this one. It was super easy to \u201cassemble.\u201d That is, just pop the wheels and sun shade on and you are good to go! It comes with a detachable cup holder & phone holder. To be honest, I won\u2019t use the phone holder just because it is quite large and I\u2019m afraid my phone might fall out or get snatched. There is a very large zipper pouch for keys, wallet, snacks or what have you\u2019s that I will go ahead and store my phone in as well. Just because I know it will be more secure. The seat is very cushy and padded and reclines almost flat. While there is no snack bar across the front, there is a little pouch for kiddos to store their cup, a snack or small toys. The sun shade is fantastic! Is has multiple angles and can almost fully cover the front. So if the kiddo falls asleep you can pull it all the way open and give them some quiet space. There is a peek-a-boo mesh window up top so you can give them extra air flow and check on them as needed. The handles are very cushy and padded and tall! Moms and dads of all heights will appreciate that. The stroller is very responsive and maneuvers well. It is easy to fold and open. You still get a small stowaway space underneath the seat that\u2019s it all umbrella strollers have. It\u2019s really compact for the features it includes and only slightly larger than a normal (and cheap) umbrella stroller. I spent a little extra and got the 3D Lite+ after comparing the basic and plus models and honestly it is 100% worth the upgrade!! If you apply for an amazon card you get $40off instant credit right now. So I took advantage of that and didn\u2019t end up spending that much more that the regular 3D Lite. Will update my review if anything comes up. LOVE this stroller so far and supper happy with my purchase!",

It basically protects him from the chest up. Lots of great features,: lightweight, easy to carry up my apartment stairs, get on the bus, very maneuverable, easy to fold up and store, looks great, and steer with one hand if needed. Easy to assemble, decent sized basket underneath for an umbrella stroller. I would reccomend to everyone looking for a small stroller",

Specially if having a heavy baby/toddler in it.In the supermarket holding 1 hand basket IMPOSSIBLE to push with other hand the stroller. Very heavy to push.2- cheap material on the seat, baby sweats a lot sitting, had to buy different brand (bugaboo) seat cover3- basket not as big as advertised (compared to other brands too) Its okay, but some items from the groceries keep falling out.HOWEVERPROS:1) Good height for tall people ( I am 1.80m and the stroller is tall enough for me)2) Canopy is big enough for decent coverage even in hot sun3) easy to fold and put in the car or tuck away at home4) the stroller is steardy for that price, been through some rough paths and it didn't fall apart.Really I wish it was easier to push and manoeuvre!! Had to switch back to my old stroller (bugaboo bee)",

The sunshade is big and is basically full coverage. The reclining feature is great and your able to adjust the recline with one hand. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a compact light weight stroller. The only downside is the clip that holds the stroller together when folded; has loosen and sometimes the stroller opens up",
