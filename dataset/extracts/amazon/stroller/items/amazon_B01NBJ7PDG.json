Fits two Nalgene's and two kids cups and still an empty center storage compartment for snacks, trash, or whatever you want close by. We use the mesh pouch on the back to store wipes. It's the perfect organizer.",

                "reviewText": "This double stroller organizer is the best one for my double bob. I wish I had found it months ago when I started looking for one. I think this is my 2nd or 3rd attempt at a double stroller organizer that would not just carry my drinks, but essentials that I don't want to keep in the bottom of the stroller since we store it outside on our porch.It's incredibly functional. The pockets are wide and large and deep. It held my coffee cup with no problems. However I did put a circular coaster underneath where I put my drink and that may have helped. In the middle pocket I keep all of our diapers and wipes and bibs. The outer Pockets just have essentials for me like lotions and sunblock, lip gloss, Kleenex, gum, that sort of stuff.Beyond all the great things about this organizer [ there are no cons for me, only Pros] i think the best part is that it straps on in 4 different places. So I can't imagine it sagging anywhere, which was a huge problem with other organizers. I can't stress enough that this is probably the best double stroller organizer out there. Do not waste your money on other products.",

Our other consoles have round designated cup holders and this has kind of a dividing piece of fabric in the large side pockets. It's great if you have a large cup, but if you have a small one, it doesn't really keep it upright. It's fine if your cup seals up, but if it doesn't you have to watch it. All in all though this is a great product and holds a ton. I also like how stable and non saggy you can make it because there are so many Velcro straps.",

                "reviewText": "Fits perfectly on my Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Pram.The functionality surpasses any other caddy I've seen on the market. It fits 2 kids water bottles in the pockets so easily. There's sleeves for you to pop a coffee cup into it to keep it secure. And spots for your phone. Then there's the deep insulated pocket. I'm so glad I read the reviews and decided to go with the one slightly more expensive. There's 6 points to secure the caddy onto. So doesn't matter so much the angle of my handles. Sooo great! Highly recommend",

We can fit about 3 bottles, a cooler pack and a few other items in the cooler portion of this organizer. Makes it so much easier when kids want a cold snack or baby needs bottle that's cooled, we don't have to dig through the bottom storage portion of the stroller anymore. I have been searching for something similar to this for a long time, i'm surprised it is not more popular and easy to find! The cooler portion makes this soooo worth it!",
