                "reviewText": "Purchased for a family trip to San Diego. Used for 8 days of Disney, zoo, sea world and walks on boardwalk.What we loved: folds down to be so small. Collapsing and opening so easy. So light weight (we had to carry it up and down a flight of steps multiple times a day and I could lift it and the baby at the same time). Smooth wheels for smooth ride. The recline function let our baby take naps on the go! All the flaps and air vents are great! Buckles held baby in well and were fairly easy to use. The footrest goes up and down which is great for baby to sit or nap easily.Did not like: my husband is 6\u20191\u201d and the stroller is too short for him. He has to lean over a bit to push. I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and thought it was a great height. The lock for the wheels is touchy. It does lock the wheels, but gets stuck on lock at times. The basket is small for stuffing all the things (does have snaps which helps a bit)Overall, I would highly recommend for a travel stroller. Will I use it all the time around my home/neighborhood?! No. But very happy with its use on a trip.",

                "reviewText": "I used this stroller multiple times per day for 7 days on a cruise and it\u2019s so awesome that I plan on using it for all future vacations and trips around town. It fit nicely through the stateroom doorway, is very easy to push and turn with 1 hand, can be folded or unfolded with 1 hand even with a baby in the other arm , and is light enough to carry while also small enough when folded to fit under the bed. My daughter napped in it at least once per day and I loved that the seat almost fully reclined (and easily moved up and down as I needed), the foot rest comes up to make it more comfortable to sleep and the back rolls up so there\u2019s mesh where the air can easily flow in and out.A huge buying factor for me was having a basket underneath that could fit my diaper bag and this did! Sure, I had to squeeze it in a little bit, but the end of the basket unsnaps to make it much easier. It also carries up to 8lbs in the basket and I never felt like it was going to rip or things would fall out.When not rolling up the back for the mesh lining to show, it has a nice size pocket where we kept my cell phone, our room keys and a ziplock of her snacks. I read other reviews saying the brake was too easy to accidentally hit, but I never had that problem and never felt like I was stepping close to it at all.Two bonus features are the bar across the seat which I was able to easily wrap her travel fan arms around, and the canopy can extend down enough to cover her entire upper body when sleeping.I\u2019d definitely recommend this to everyone, especially for cruising!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller hoping for the best, but expecting not the greatest\u2026..boy was I impressed when it arrived! Firstly it\u2019s a very smooth ride, all the components feel & look well made and it feels very comfortable for the baby in the back section that the baby lies on. My daughter was just shy of 4 months old when we used it. We took it to Australia and I used it daily\u2026all terrains I used it on worked well\u2026..concrete paths, hard sand on the beach, unsealed beach paths (slightly rocky).It went on the plane as hand luggage which was awesome - just had to remove the bumper bar for it to fit in the overhead compartmentThe recline is near flat which worked brilliantly for sleeps.Good amount of space below for shopping or baby bag.Easy to fold up and down one handed.My only gripes were :1. the umbrella that comes down does not stay down firmly due to the position of the zipper if you have it out in expanded mode\u2026..it\u2019s a bit annoying but not a deal breaker. You have to keep pulling it down as it creeps up as you are moving2. I didn\u2019t take any stroller clips with me which meant making it dark by covering it with a muslin wrap was tricky, but easily fixed by taking pegs.After using this stroller there is no way I\u2019d pay for the babyzen yoyo. I\u2019ve had one of them in the past that was stolen \u2026. but you can\u2019t go past the price of this stroller.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this stroller for traveling to Europe alone with my daughter. And i\u2019m so glad I did. I enjoyed the smooth rides and the the way that it reclines fully. My toddler took so many naps on it everyday everywhere. It is so lightweight and small when it\u2019s folded. So easy to fold specially if you\u2019re traveling solo and you have to carry your baby with one hand, this stroller makes it so much easier.",

It fits perfectly fine on overhead cabin. Highly recommended if you are flying. Wouldn't advise this for regular or daily use. Too good for indoors",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as somewhat of an impulse buy for our Disneyland trip. We had a 4yo and 8 month old and after trying out a double stroller, we decided we would just bring two single strollers.From the moment we pulled this stroller out of the box, we knew it was different in the best way possible. It\u2019s so light and compact, even when it\u2019s open. You can close and open it with one hand, maneuvers like butter (seriously!). The entire time at Disneyland, we just kept saying how much we like the stroller. In fact, we will buy a second one for our next trip, so we aren\u2019t lugging around our jogger as the other single stroller.Cons? Not really a con, just is what is in\u2026. It\u2019s obviously not an \u201call terrain\u201d stroller. It does not roll well off paved road. But it does roll like butter on paved road.",

                "reviewText": "We recently purchased because we are traveling a lot and wanted a stroller that was compact and lightweight. Just finished week long vacation and stroller worked great. Love that the foot rest is adjustable and reclined to lay down position. The only down side is, when you fold it. There isn\u2019t a clip or anything to hold it all together, so if you don\u2019t hold it all together it will just open back up again.",
