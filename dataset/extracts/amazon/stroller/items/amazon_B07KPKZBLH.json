It definitely is compact (will update after our trip to confirm it fits in overhead bin), the back is very sturdy to either sit up or lay child down at different settings, rolls nice, and my favorite part was getting to put our car seat on it as well for easy transportation. Everything came in pristine condition, the bar that attaches to the seat is easy to release, also stays on and swings up and over for easy access. I will give an update after our trip to see if it held up - pros & cons!",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is a great lightweight option. It folds down fairly small and has a nice rolling option (like a suitcase). We\u2019ve used it for flying also. For bigger planes, it actually fits in overhead storage. Not the case for smaller ones.Downsides are the storage underneath is small (can\u2019t quit fit our diaper bag) and there are no cup holders for kiddo or parents. We got a generic pocket thing to hang for us. So we put our drinks and keys etc in that.Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is the nicest compact stroller I could imagine. Other compact stroller boasted their sizes however you have to give up something for that. Not with this stroller. It still has a large sun visor that covers the entire seat. It also has 360 wheels in the front to make maneuvering that much easier. It reclines!! Which is something not many others did!! I love that the 5 point harness has lite padding so it's not just an uncomfortable strap on the little one. It also has a small storage bin on the bottom. I also love the design, its sleek and simple.Just a couple of things I've noticed since we got it. It folds down to a great size however it may still be just a bit large to fit in the overhead bin. I have a trip in 2 weeks and will try it out then. Also I need to practice the opening a bit to get into a good rhythm with it. It opens with one hand with the exception of undoing the clip that prevents it from falling open on its own. But with some practice I see this becoming really simple. Overall this is a great stroller and I'm really looking forward to traveling with it and little one!",

Airline made us gate check this item both ways. Too large for the overhead, esp on a full flight. The carry bag zipper broke almost immediately. I can\u2019t seem to find a replacement. It seems to ride nicely and I like that the back has different positions. Lightweight.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller because we are going on vacation to Mexico in a few months and I realized that I'll need to bring a stroller with us since it'll be WAY too hot to have to carry my infant around everywhere (plus it will make my life easier in the airports as well). My baby will be just 5 months old by the time we travel so I was looking for something that folds really small, is lightweight, not super expensive, and reclines almost flat since the baby wont totally be able to support himself yet. This stroller is almost perfect! In fact, if you use an infant support pillow like I show in the pictures, you can even put a newborn in there safely/comfortably. For reference, my baby is 3 weeks old in the pictures included. The sun visor is nice and big so it provides pretty good coverage, especially when the seat is fully reclined. The basket underneath is very small and there is no cupholder but you can find attachments or accessories if necessary. Some reviews said this stroller is hard to fold/unfold- I completely DISAGREE. Its very smooth and easy to fold or unfold and you do it with one hand. The brake is a one foot brake so thats super convenient too. And one of the best features is the adjustable foot rest. I fold it upright so my baby cant slide down when he's not buckled. Overall this stroller was a great buy and I recommend it to anyone in need of a small-folding option. The only partially negative things I have to agree with others on is that it doesnt seem small enough to fit in an overhead bin on a plane...its a little too big I think but I'll confirm after our trip! So far Im SO glad I purchased this! Well worth the price!",

I love that I can easily adjust the shade to protect my baby from the sun. The stroller is also very easy to maneuver and the one-hand fold makes it easy to use while holding my baby.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Jovial JPC20BK Portable Folding Lightweight Baby Stroller. It has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to any parent in need of a compact and easy-to-use stroller for traveling or everyday use.",

We'll see how it goes when we fly.",

The basket underneath seems large and it\u2019s easy to maneuver.
