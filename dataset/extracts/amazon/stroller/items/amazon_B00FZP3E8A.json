                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great set, but absolutely fantastic stroller.",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this two weeks before my son was born in August of 2020, and we are at almost two years of use. I don't often review products but I love this thing. So I came back to let you all know it.The car seat:The car seat is fine. It's safe, it wasn't super bulky, it was incredibly easy to install, and it made changing cars a breeze if you buy an extra base. While the seat is technically rated to 36 lbs, we found that our son was uncomfortable reclining so far back as he got older and more capable of moving his head. We could not safely change the angle of the seat to help with his discomfort, so we got a new one around 6 months that has those adjustment features but can grow with him to front facing as well. This car seat is specifically designed for newborns and as a set with the stroller, so it absolutely served it's purpose. As far as using with the stroller, the seat settled very securely in the stroller and made my hours-long postpartum walks with my newborn absolute ease. He often fell asleep because of how smooth the ride was but the buckles, while safe, were never too obstructive that I had issues accessing him if he needed a feed or change while we were out. The sun cover on the car seat itself is a nice feature, but it is obviously made for tiny babies and does not hold up to the curious hands of older babies. It was, however incredible for giving my sleeping newborn shade on those early walks, especially in conjunction with the stroller's sun cover. All in all, this was a solid newborn car seat but don't expect it to last much longer than that.The stroller:I'm new to the stroller game, but I've done a bunch of research. It's been almost two years of using this stroller at least once a week, but it's probably more like two/three times a week. And this thing is the most \"worth it\" piece of equipment I've ever purchased for my child. It holds up to multi-hour walks, jogs, and awkward skips. It holds up to peaceful sleeping newborn and kicking, crying toddler. It holds up to spills and the unexpected pouring rain. My son is comfortable, he's easily accessible, he's strapped in such a way that it makes it hard for him to escape but easy to access, and he always has the biggest smile on his face when he sees it. The seat is adjustable, so when he was younger but too old for the newborn seat, it was easy to lay him back and let him sleep. Now that he's almost two, he wants to see everything and can sit straight up. There's storage underneath enough for the diaper bag, my purse, a ball, a mega bubble bottle, and whatever drinks and snacks I have. The jogging strap gives me security when I've got him out with me on runs (I had to purchase another one because I lost the first, but it's virtually the same). The only complaint I have is with the mom compartment on top: it sometimes doesn't fit my phone, drink, sippy cup, and mom snacks, making me have to stop to pull those out of the bottom compartment when I need them. A little bit more depth on that top and a bit more space in the cup holders would have gone a long way.But the star of the stroller is the wheels. The WHEELS. I can tackle almost any terrain. Sidewalk? Of course. Grass? Sure. Dirt road? No problem. Gravel? Easy. Park mulch? Effortless. Uneaven roads? Fabulous. I take this thing trail running. I've taken it to historic districts with brick pavers instead of sidewalks with my child sleeping comfortably. I've walked on all sorts of terrain, hopped so many curbs. Never a problem. Steering is so effortless, even while running, but especially in venues with more limited space like our local park. I had to use my niece's old stroller when I went to a Halloween event with my sister, and plastic wheels are not it. It was harder to push, harder to steer, it did terrible on sloped driveways and cracked sidewalks, it was a disaster in her newer suburb.The rubber wheels not only make for a smoother ride, they're patchable and refillable. We have a local bike shop near the park and they'll literally take care of it for free. The wheels hold up great, though, we've only needed to ask the bike shop for air twice and we haven't needed a patch yet.If you're on the fence, know this; a few months after my son was born, we took a cross-country move in hatchback. Despite our incredibly limited space, I refused to leave the stroller just out of fear that we wouldn't be able to repurchase the same one at our destination.",

                "reviewText": "Got this jogger specifically because of other great reviews and the price, and couldn\u2019t be happier with the purchase! Bebe adjusted to it easily and loves using the snack tray! Perfect amount of storage for runs or walks or small grocery trips even, for us! It is nice and steady when running and easy to push one handed to keep as much of a normal stride as possible. I really love the real wheels too that take air, makes it so much better quality over other strollers with plastic wheels and helps it work well over all sorts of terrains.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 8 months ago when I was getting back into running. My son was about 18 months at the time. I hadn\u2019t run in years so I couldn\u2019t justify spending $500-$600 on a BOB or Thule jogging stroller. I figured if I ran regularly, then I could EARN a fancy stroller to continue motivating me. I found it to be a perfectly good running stroller and my son seemed to love it too. But 6 months and a couple hundred miles later, I decided I had earned a FANCY RICH PERSON stroller since I was meeting my running goals and had been saving. I tried the Thule but realized it was too small for my son! At just 2 years old he looked like a 4 year old in the seat and no snack tray or cup holder for long runs. I next looked at the BOB, researched, and pulled the trigger on one for Christmas. When it arrived it was monstrous\u2026 yet somehow my son didn\u2019t have any more room than he already had in this Baby Jogger. I took it for a test run anyway and HATED IT! It was bulky, slow to respond, heave, super tall for me (I am short), and my son didn\u2019t seem particularly comfortable. Plus the snack tray was another $50. I immediately packed it back up and returned it. I have officially realized more money doesn\u2019t mean better product. I can say for sure this is the best jogger out there and there\u2019s no secret magic to the more expensive brands. It\u2019s light, responsive, narrow, and I\u2019m hopeful it will continue to comfortably hold my 2.5 year old for another year or so. I\u2019ve used this in 5k and 10k races and throughout my half marathon training. I just can\u2019t believe what a great product this is ESPECIALLY for the price. We also take this to the zoo and the beach. We put it to work but also take good care of it and it\u2019s been so great to us! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",

                "reviewText": "When shopping for a stroller, I searched several second hand stores, looking for a good deal on a more \"all-terrain\" stroller. The stroller we'd been gifted had small, hard plastic wheels that was like pushing a freight train across grass and gravel. The prices on second hand strollers was ridiculous. I found this stroller on sale during Prime Days. The price was a fraction of second hand strollers.It's wonderful, high quality, very maneuverable. It's easy to push, even across grass and gravel, which was my top priority in purchasing a new stroller. The straps that swivel components to eliminate tangled and twisted straps. The buckle is easy to clip and unclip. The seat reclines in any position you prefer. The canopy rotates forward much further than other strollers, providing shade at many angles.All in all, great stroller and great price.",
