The customer service is horrible as I\u2019ve reached out multiple times and have yet to get a response. This stroller put my baby in danger , would NOT recommend.

That\u2019s one of the exciting parts for me as I was looking forward to use that cup holder for my Starbucks lol. I will be reaching out to see if they can send me the missing cup holder part . Hoping for the best . The stroller over all is perfect . Sleek and lightweight but I expected to be a bit small . The handle is larger than expected .",
