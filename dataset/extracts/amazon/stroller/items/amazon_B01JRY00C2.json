It's easy to secure in the car, and the OnBoard 35 LT Infant Car Seat is not only lightweight but also offers excellent protection for my child. The stroller, with its smooth ride and easy maneuverability, has made outings a breeze, and the canopy provides ample shade on sunny days.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Some of the reviews are misleading!!!!! Here\u2019s some clarification on the misleading reviews",
                "reviewText": "I am writing this review because it\u2019s really hard to find strollers that are good quality, not cheap or too expensive. I bought this stroller for my nephew/godson which is now 6 months old. We had a really hard time finding a good stroller and a lot of it had to do with misleading reviews! I saw a lot of reviews saying that when inserting the car seat into the stroller it falls right through, BUT this only happens if it is not installed correctly!! The bottom cup holder on the stroller (which is removable) must be in place to secure the car seat into place!Also, when inserting the car seat into a vehicle, it has a second piece which is the part you buckle into the car which also attaches and detaches from the car seat, then after that piece/base is installed and securely fastened into the vehicle, you then put the car seat right on top of the base until you hear the click. Just like with other car seats like this one, you may have to adjust the seat (usually passenger seat) For extra security. We\u2019ve had this stroller for about a month, we\u2019ve traveled overseas, had to go through the airport, and you name it, and this stroller has never once disappointed! It\u2019s super easy to install and take apart IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! I just took this image to show how the stroller looks after a month of use, notice that the cup holder on the bottom is still in place to secure the car seat onto the stroller. It\u2019s very comfortable, user friendly, and for those tall folks, the height of the stroller is great as you won\u2019t have to bend over much to push the stroller. I personally love this as I am 5\u20197 and I do not have to bend over to push it. The only con is that it doesn\u2019t have much storage, just the bottom part, you can fit a decent amount of things in it but it would be a nice bonus to have more storage. I am very happy with my purchase, I would by it again and I do recommend it!!!! My only advice is to remember to follow the instructions if you do purchase it.",

I like the deal that you get with this stroller and car seat combo, everything works as it should but our baby girl needs a new one now because it\u2019s too small for her, seatbelt part could have more length to be able to click in it\u2019s so tight to the point you can\u2019t even put two fingers in between. So for anyone considering purchasing this combo please keep this in mind and look at other options to save you some money in the long run.",

                "reviewText": "Quality stroller for good price. I waffled endlessly on purchasing a new stroller for my third baby. My old one was a Chico bravo and was good quality and cost twice as much as this one. I was worried it would be cheap and not convient as the other one I had. Low and behold in addition to the adorable and unique color (got the lavender one) this stroller is surprisingly good. It doesn\u2019t run quite as smooth As the bravo but for the price a totally legit purchase. Only things I don\u2019t like is the loud clicking when you adjust the canopy, wakes my sleeping baby, and the plastic latch that holds the stroller when you fold it In half. Just seems a tad flimsy. Wheels are decent. Storage is good. Parent tray fits my phone and has a little divet so it sits up. Baby likes it.Back over a year later.Still holding strong. The latch still works great. Canvas is stain resistant and a baby wipe gets any dirt off. My baby is almost two and we still use it regularly well worth the money!!!! The \u201cnoisey\u201d canopy quieted down after some use. Great purchase for great price.",

Es excelente para las condiciones de uso normales y un producto de muy alta calidad para el costo que tiene, que como bien dije adquir\u00ed en oferta pero por el cual pagar\u00eda su precio original pues est\u00e1 bien merecido.Recomiendo adquirirla en oferta y realizar una compra inteligente ya que est\u00e1 al nivel de marcas como Chicco (tanto en precio como en calidad) y es muy superior a Prinsel as\u00ed que puedes adquirir un producto de excelente calidad a un precio muy muy bajo en el mercado.",
