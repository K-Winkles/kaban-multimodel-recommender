                "reviewText": "We bought this to use for a trip we were going on and hoped it would fit down the aisle of an airplane. We were pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly. Granted not a lot of wiggle room, but it fit so we could get down the aisle then break it down to put into a seat. The chest clip is bluetooth connected for a safety feature that will be really good since we live in where temperatures get really hot. It offers a warning if the cars temperature is too high, also alerts if the child is left in the car or buckled too long. Another nice feature is the front wheels can be removed and placed at the bottom of the seat if you aren't using the base piece in your vehicle, making it easier to install. Overall, I would recommend this seat. It is a little on the heavier side due to having the stroller part and car seat in one unit.",

I love how easy it is in and out of the van , can also be carried as just the carseat with no wheels (major weight difference) the premie inserts were perfect my baby wasnt premie just tiny so the extra fluff for her is great. The extension handle is perfect height for the stroller mode. It glides nice and smooth. The extra safety cautions they take on the straps is very comforting. I couldnt be more happy with a carseat!",

Convenient and quick to go from take out of car seat to stroller/stroller to car seat to base. Super easy to adjust straps to fit baby as needed. 10/10, definitely recommend.",

The only downside to this is it\u2019s heavy which makes sense due to it being a stroller car seat combined I don\u2019t recommend it for single moms only cause of how heavy it is but all and all it\u2019s a good product.",

                "reviewText": "We were going to get a Doona but decided to get the Shyft Dualride when it went on sale. Overall, we are very happy and it functions as well as expected. Once you get the hang of it, it collapses and unfolds pretty easily and is an easy latch in the car seat base. The handle for stroller mode is higher than the Doona so you don't look like an 8 year old awkwardly pushing your doll stroller that you got as a 4 year old. In addition, the wheels can come off so if you are in a situation where you just want the car seat you have that option. For example, at the supermarket you can remove the wheels and put car seat in shopping cart as opposed to doing the awkward one handed push pulls with the car seat and shopping cart like is done with Doona. An annoyance with this is you can only detach the wheels when they're latched to the base so if you're not by your car, you are stuck with the wheels. Also, the hood of the Dual Shyft is big enough to protect the baby from the sun, as opposed to Doona which comes up short. It comes with a detachable stroller bag and cup holder which are useful, but because you can't collapse the stroller with the bag and the cup holder gets in the way in car seat mode, you have to consciously keep track of them and attach them for every use. While my baby was not small, this can hold smaller babies comfortably, unlike the Doona which may not fit early or small babies well. It does feel a little shaky when in stroller mode and would be nice if it was a little more sturdy. Also, while it comes with a base, as of yet Evenflo does not sell separate bases for the Dual Shyft if you want for another car.Major complaint isn't for the car seat itself but the general Evenflo sensor they install to tell you if the kid is in the car. My first time using it, I dropped my baby and wife off at doctor's office before I went to park and my phone wouldn't stop telling me loudly that my kids was left in the car (to be clear, I was in the car not the kid). I ended up having to uninstall the sensor app on my phone to stop it from warning me of this inaginary issue. While in theory I'm supportive of a warning system to save babies, if it's disfunctional then it's worse than nothing and I hope Evenflo fixes it. As an aside, if you're an Orthodox Jew who keeps Shabbos this can be an issue if you use it as your regular stroller due to a light that flashes when you buckle it. A workaround is to not take out the plastic tab when you first use it and the whole sensor won't work. As the systems is terrible anyway, this is not much of a loss and I just recommend very strongly to not be an idiot by leaving your baby in the car alone under any circumstances.Overall, I like the car seat and considering I got it at a cheaper price point than the Doona it was definitely a no brainer. Huge fan of the higher stroller handle and detchable wheels as its easier to use and more flexible than the Doona",
