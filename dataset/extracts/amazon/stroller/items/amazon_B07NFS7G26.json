                "reviewText": "I love my new stroller! I bought and returned TOO MANY bc I wasn't happy. I had bought the Uppababy Minu and also the Ergobaby Metro 2020 and returned both. I was looking things like; 1: comfort for my LO, 2: foldability (my new word), 3: maneuverability, and being a woman- 4: a nice sleek looking design thats easy to clean.Seat: the seat is actually flat which makes it more comfortable. The minu and metro both had a slight tilt in the seat that after a few minutes my daughter looked like the seat belt was the only thing holding her in and honestly looked super uncomfortable.The minu seat was very hard and rigid (could be fixed with a cushion but that'd cost more $ after the $430 I already paid).The metro was so plush and so comfortable, I mean come on- the brand is ergobaby, but not if my kid is hanging on by a thread. I wish ergobaby would sell just the seat cushion bc I'd buy it in a second. My daughter's comfort is first and foremost on my list.Foldability: super easy to \"pop\" open and close, not \"one handed\" bc of the safety latch but I open the stroller before I get my kid. I will say it is do-able one handed if the latch is unlocked first and then opened. I also like the close bc it'll stand up on its own without being all over the nasty ground. One thing I don't like is that when you close it the front bottom part of the stroller hits the ground and can get scraped but I'm trying to find a way to fix that.Minu- great to open and close and oddly very satisfying \ud83d\ude43, also very very sturdy, like a damn tank!Metro- hard to pop open like the other 2 strollers. Like you have to fling the damn thing multiple times to get it to lock open or you have to do it manually while this oddly noodle like stroller is just flopping around.Maneuverability: joovy kooper is small width wise, much better then the full size bus I had before (you would think someone would've told me I didn't need a huge stroller), takes turns like a champ and fits between the tiniest space.Both minu and metro turned great and were small enough width wise. So all 3 are pretty even.FOR THE KID: Kooper has a nice tray, which is a must for us, and the leg rest adjusts which we actually use a lot more then expected.Minu doesn't have adjustable leg rest and the tray was extra at the time and metro was hard to push the buttons to adjust. The seat CAN sit straight up if you pull hard enough on the string/tab thing. This is the same type of adjuster the other strollers have (I know for sure on the minu, don't remember the metro). I actually don't like this part of the stroller but it's fine and not too annoying.The seat is plenty big enough for a toddler. My daughter is almost 3 weighing 30 lbs and about 36-37 inches and she has plenty of space for her head and for her legs. I was worried about this bc all reviews I saw were for little ones a year and under. She can use this for awhile. She LOVES the sunshade and I do too. It's nice and big enough to cover that late afternoon sun from blinding her and gives her a private little space if she needs to sleep.FOR US: looks nice and sleek (I bought the all black) and unlike the minu the all black doesn't cost an extra $30 bucks after the $400 you dish out first. Metro didn't cost more for black either though. The tray pops out for easy cleaning and I can close the stroller with it. This is a selling point of joovy but I also can do this with other strollers that don't advertise this. The storage area is made in such a way that things don't fall out and is pretty spacious. With the minu things would easily fall out of the front bc of how it's made/angled. Metro was very small and would fall out the back. Kooper also has a little zip storage bag which comes in handy at odd times. I do worry about the canopy being weather proof. I live in the southwest were we don't get much rain and the winters are mild compared to what others may have but I will find a cover if necessary to protect my baby. I do like the peekaboo window, it's a simple fold over design with a big enough space to actually see your LO.We're gonna have another baby so I love that I can buy the carseat adapter and use basically any careseat brand and not need a new stroller (one of the reasons I bought this one). And the wheels can be changed so this can definitely make it through another kid. I haven't washed the fabrics yet, so far all I've done is wipe down here and there but it's been easy to clean cheetos and chocolate \ud83d\ude0b.I've been looking for a unicorn stroller and I think I may have finally found it. I've read hundreds of reviews and looked at/tried out easily over 30+ strollers (my poor kid being my test dummy for lack of a better term). I'm surprised joovy kooper isn't on more top 10 lists. Everyone has different needs and all babies are unique but from what I've tried this works great with babies that can hold themselves upright. I'm not afraid to spend $ to get a quality item, but sometimes the higher end models don't meet my expectations.I'd highly recommend joovy kooper. I will update after we've had the stroller longer for durability, etc.I don't get compensated in anyway, just wanna help out other parents since I did most of the hard work already... your welcome! \ud83d\ude07",

                "reviewText": "So, first of all let me tell you I looked at soooooooo many strollers, it was exhausting!I have been using this stroller for awhile now, so I can give you my honest review of it.I was given a Bob stroller (a great stroller and must have for serious outings/hiking/walking/running).But I wanted another stroller that was light and easy to maneuver around, especially for quick trips or a short walk, but even for a zoo day too. I also wanted features of a good sun cover, basket storage, and a tray. This stroller is EVERYTHING!!!It is super easy to maneuver anywhere, it's lightweight but definitely NOT cheaply made. Handles bumps in the road with ease, I never get stuck. One finger easy turning. Seriously fantastic.The sun cover has absolutely AMAZING coverage, with a a perfect peek through area to watch the baby/toddler.The tray is fantastic!!!! Easy to open just one side, easy to take completely on/off, easy to clean and folds with the stroller!The backseat adjustment is easy to use and allows any position you want.Brakes are secure and simple to use, located in a convenient area as well.Seat belts are very secure from the child opening them....but easy to use for the adult (as I find some were horrible to try to open and close).Handle bar is nicely padded, comfortable to use.The storage is VERY roomy.It has a nice little pouch to put your phone and small things in.There is a cup holder, but it is for lighter cups (not your hydro flask).Folding is a dream, as well as lifting to put anywhere...and reopening too.I bought the green color, which is beautiful in person (the video has the more accurate color...the picture on the website looks terrible).Every time I used this stroller, I'd make my husband laugh...I kept repeating \"this stroller is amazing.\"Now I used my Bob stroller for the infant car seat, so I can not comment on the use of that, although I really imagine it's pretty great with this stroller too.I can't say enough good things about it.It's a fantastic stroller, a great buy!!!",

I definitely recommend it and the price is very good for all the good quality it has. My two-year-old son remains relaxed and asleep in the stroller. I would say that it is better than the Babyzen yoyo because of how tall the chair is and the wheels are quite good and the hood is undoubtedly quite extendable and covers the children well from the sun or rain. without a doubt I recommend it.",
