We were hoping her infant seat which is a smaller one (less expensive) would fit in this stroller, but it doest even com3 close. This stroller although it's light weight which is great but it's also cheaply made. The stroller is also uncomfortably short for someone who is fairly tall and there is no adjusting the handle at all. I wish I had just spent a little more and gotten a better stroller. The mother of the baby isn't capable of making major decisions or understanding of things needed to understand for picking out the right things she needs for this baby. I feel really crappy that I got something that isn't going to work the way she needs it to. I did look at reviews and could have sworn they were good, but funny how now I've purchased it , the reviews seem to not be as good as I remember. Maybe it's the Matrix we live in or maybe it was a different product all together but either way this items needs some work to be great.",
