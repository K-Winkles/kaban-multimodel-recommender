                "reviewText": "We've had our Uppababy Ridge for about 2 months now, and I figured we had enough miles on it to post a review.For context, we have a big/tall baby girl and were transitioning out of a Doona stroller/car seat setup into something that would last from ~6 months until they were able to keep up on their own. We went with the Ridge for an \"off road/walking\" stroller, and chose another Uppababy model for \"around town\" activities.This stroller is awesome for what it is. It's about the best I've come across for legitimate outdoor 'all terrain' activities. It has a 'full suspension' system in the body, along with disk brakes that mean it can handle just about any terrain you'd be walking a baby across. I can't vouch for how it does in a mud pit, sand dune, or on Jeep trails though.Both my wife and I use ours several times a week on our parks 3 mile walking trail that has a few sections of broken concrete, and light cedar mulch sections, and the stroller is perfect for that. It glides right over stuff that our Doona (or more in-town oriented Uppababy) stroller would have choked on.We've also taken it to our ranch that is paved with caliche roads that are dusty/very rough on a standard stroller, but this thing has zero problems.So far we have probably ~50-75 miles on the stroller, and it's held up great. It folds down with the flick of a wrist, and I just throw it in the bed of my truck (has enough weight to not blow around/out); fits in the back of my wifes Honda Pilot without an issue.In summary, I'm super impressed with this thing, and I think you'd be very hard pressed to find a better one for the purpose.That said, I would not recommend this stroller as a \"one stroller to do everything\". Admittedly I was hoping for that initially, but it's just too big/long to use in a grocery store/shop type setting.Hope this helps someone out there!",

                "reviewText": "We had an older, used Uppababy Cruze that was excellent quality, so when we decided to switch to a jogging stroller, we knew UB would be worth the money. After comparing this stroller to other brands (Bob, Guava & Thule) this one beat them all for a few major reasons:1. Added hand break. This is so helpful when going down Hill, even while walking b/c it saves your knees. This was something most strollers we didn\u2019t have.2. Added accessories\u2026 unlike other UB strollers, this one comes with a covered bottom basket & water bottle. There is SO much storage on this stroller. Deep pocket in the hood & 2 side pockets in child seat.3. Lumbar support for baby4. Front wheel locking. While other strollers have this feature, the UB was easier to use than most b/c it\u2019s a 1 button press5. Suspension in back wheels to absorb shockA few other features we love\u2026 disc brakes, wheels are so easy to remove for storage/travel or maintenance, 3yr warranty, the look\u2026 very stylish & all fabric is removable to easy washing. I don\u2019t have any complaints. This stroller is perfect for your everyday walk or few mile jogs. It does well on un-smooth surfaces, including small gravel. We\u2019ve taken it over some rocky surfaces, and it did okay. I don\u2019t think most strollers would do well (unless you\u2019re paying a lot more) but if you push it at a slight incline (front wheel up) it\u2019s a lot better to get over whatever rocky surface you need to pass. For the price, this is a great buy!",

                "reviewText": "Other reviews have gone through the excellent features this stroller has. One other reason I bought it is because the tires do not need air filling. Yes, air-filled tires are best, but they require a maintenance I know I would not be able to give. These instead has a nice durable surface, never gone flat. The canopy is excellent, and the stroller has several mesh areas to allow breeze in, good if you live in hot climates or go out during summer. Is it comfy? Well my son has taken full on naps while on it.Can you run a 5k with it? YES! We did recently, and the stroller was very nice. Boy never cried or complained, he even was playing with his feet. Handbreak was great for downhill.My complains may have something to do with the fact I am short (5'1\"). The \"easy fold and unfold\" is not so easy for me. I'm always figuring where to twist and pull the handle, and push the wheels to open it up. Not a big deal, but I think it is not as easy as others put it. Also, although the handlebar is adjustable, the lowest setting is about the upper limit for my comfort. Especially when my no frills car seat stroller frame has a much lower adjustment.And yea, I want to point out this is the model AFTER the recall, so the problem it had with the disc brakes was fixed before this was shipped.",
