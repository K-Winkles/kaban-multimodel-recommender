                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a Disney/Universal trip. My 5 year old granddaughter was very specific about having a pink stroller. She loved it. I do wish it had more storage at the bottom, but for being so compact for its size, I understand. I wish I had purchased a gate check stroller bag as it is a really nice stroller. It did get a bit dirty on the return flight.Pros:- Folds up nicely like a small umbrella stroller and has a handle.- The stroller organizer bag is a plus. We already had one, but we used both for storing smaller items.- small enough to get around crowds- it was simple to open and close. It was tricky to figure out the closing in a hurry, but I got it down after a few tries. I felt silly for not realizing I just needed to push down on the middle paddle and push up on the right one just using my foot. I skipped the instructions for how to use it.-fit perfectly in the back of the rental minivan, Voyager, without having to fold it down.Cons:- not really a con, but wish it was made a tad bigger for bigger kids with something that they can rest their legs/feet on. We had park days where my granddaughter fell asleep in the stroller at the end of the night, but her feet would drag almost losing a Croc, but we managed. It was easier to get her from the park exit to the vehicle in a stroller as she slept or was too tired to walk.",

This stroller is great for infants but not meant for toddlers over 36 inches and more than 27lbs (which they state is good for up to 50lbs). The black straps though adjustable are just not long enough for bigger toddler/kids. The crotch strap is very short even when trying to adjust and my child complained instantly when trying to buckle him in. Also his foot would dangle and hit the wheels when he fell asleep. I really wanted to love the product unfortunately because it didn't fit my needs and expectations I had to return.",
