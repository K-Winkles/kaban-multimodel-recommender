Took me a minute to figure out how to operate but once you get a hang of it, it's no big deal! Now that the vacation is over, I am having some trouble finding the best place to store it.Picture of the stroller in the back of the Mazda CX-9. It's better than keeping it in the trunk but not very convenient.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this stroller after doing research for our trip to Disney. We chose this because of the way it folds up and can be reclined which was perfect for napping. However , we had several issues with this stroller.-The sunshade will NOT stay on. We have had to fix it every time we try to use it . I am not sure why but it never stays on and it is very inconvenient to keep stopping to fix it.-The straps for putting my toddler in the stroller keep coming apart . This happens almost every time we buckle him in and out . I'm not sure if our stroller has some sort to defect, but it takes up a lot of time fixing this .-The bar is not removable, which is fine, but it doesn't allow for ease taking your child out . My son is only one, but on the taller side for his age . It's still really hard to get him out and he has to stretch out his legs so that we can remove him.-The storage is okay, not too large underneath. Enough to fit water bottles, sunscreen, etc. It didn't fit our diaper bag which was fine. However if we hang our diaper bag on the back when my child is not in the stroller, it will fall backwards . It just not very sturdy.I would not recommend this stroller for a theme park or travel/trips. The issues have been causing us to take a lot of time on our visit to fix.",

I even tried to use channel locks to clip it onto the bar as the pictures show it should be used and that wouldn't work. I made a strap out of industrial strength velcro and some large ribbon to lock it for now. Also, the front bumper bar is not removable. I tried, but it doesn't come off, which is the one main issue I have with this. I used my points and a gift car to buy it, so I don't think I can get those back. If I could, I'd probably get a different one where the bar is removable and the folding lock works.",
