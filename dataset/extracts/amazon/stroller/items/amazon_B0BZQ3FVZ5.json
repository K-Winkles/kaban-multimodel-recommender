We got it so we would have something for her when she's not with her baby brother in the Vista V2. It's a great umbrella stroller and the only one we could find that would fit her. She's 3.5 ft tall and 41 lbs and it has plenty of room for her to sit and lay back. The canopy is large and covers her sufficiently. She likes it. The storage basket underneath his a little snug but it's an umbrella stroller, so I it's not going to have a ton of storage. It folds up easy and the cup holder is a plus.",
