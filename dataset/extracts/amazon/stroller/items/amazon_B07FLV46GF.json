                "reviewText": "I did my homework before buying this stroller and have been completely satisfied with my purchase. We have a traditional jogging stroller that is far too heavy and cumbersome to deal with in the everyday world. My in laws bought us a more manageable (and cheaper) umbrella stroller, but my husband and I are both over 6 feet tall and it was almost impossible for us to use bc it was so short. Plus, it had no storage or cup holders. This stroller fit the bill perfectly. It\u2019s comfortable for our tall frames, has adequate storage, lightweight and fits perfectly in our compact car. The harness is extremely easy to fasten and unfasten . And the added bonus is the cup holder, which is designed for a normal plastic water bottle.The only issue I could see other parents having would be the lack of recline for naps. The seat is very upright and doesn\u2019t adjust at all. It isn\u2019t an issue for us at all because my daughter will only nap in her crib and car seat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it in February of 2020 for my now 5 year old. So far after 2 years of usage it has held up pretty good. So good that one day my daughter wanted my oldest son that\u2019s about 5\u201911 and 186lbs to get on it and play with her which he did. He climbs in it pretty often to play with his little sister and surprising not only does he fit relatively comfortable it also supports his weight just fine. Just for fun I\u2019ve included a pic of my daughter playing with him trying to buckle him up which obviously didn\u2019t reach and the other of my son casually sitting on the stroller. When my son sent me those pics one day when he was babysitting her I totally expected to get home to a broken stroller but I did not. I\u2019m not saying I recommend this but, even after all that abuse its still holding strong and, now that my daughter is getting older and doesn\u2019t really use it as a stroller as much I don\u2019t mind if they want to keep play around with it like that anymore and if it ends up breaking at least I know I truly got my money out of it no doubt.",

                "reviewText": "Love this stroller. Folds nicely and quickly. Seems sturdy and quite functional. My only complaint would be the seat is quite small, as in not wide at all. If your child has a larger behind, it would be difficult for them to sit comfortably or even get the straps clicked. We ordered the green colour and it is definitely teal not green (which I personally prefer).",
