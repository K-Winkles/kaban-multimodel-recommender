Have been able to bring my 4lb twins home from the NICU with it, it passed the carseat tests with them and has been lightweight to carry. They are easy to put in and out of the truck without any issues. The partial covers that come with them automatically is lovely.The only big issue with it is that they are missing one piece (red latch) on the stroller to hold the front carseat from falling. It wasn't in the packaging so I haven't been able to use the stroller for both twins at the same time.",
