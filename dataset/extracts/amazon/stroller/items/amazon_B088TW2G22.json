                "reviewText": "My wife and I had a Maxi Cosi car-seat so we decided to give the stroller a try.I can't compare it to other expensive strollers, but I do want to address some key points that we thought were important:1) Ease of use and storage - The stroller is fairly easy to store. It collapses with one hand but is not super small when collapsed. Handles extend enough for me (6' tall)2) Wheels - The wheels are really nice and large. You can easily cross some grass/dirt crossings if necessary and it won't get hung up on roots like strollers with smaller wheels.3) Build quality - It's primarily made of aluminum and is very solid. AKA, solid construction piece and not made of many tiny parts.4) Baby comfort - The included seat is actually VERY nice. We use it when we don't need our car-seat. But it's very easy to switch back and forth between the stroller seat and the car-seat.The only thing I think is a bit flimsy is the storage basket on the bottom It's not securely attached so it kind of flops around. We still use it, but keep an eye on stuff on it while walking.I expect this stroller will outlast its required use. Which is why we didn't feel bad for paying this much for it.",

It is a beautiful seat tho. Exactly what I needed.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Maxi Cosi Coral XP car seat so I am limited to which strollers I can connect with. I needed a double stroller because we are about to add baby 2. I ordered this because it is a more economically sound purchase than the vista v2. I have to say the benefit is so many of the things provided in the base purchase of the Maxi Cosi Lila is refreshing because each of those items like a snack tray and cup holder are add ons for the V2, however let me just say this as clearly as possible, you get what you pay for. The car seat adapters are warped it made it nearly impossible to get the car seat back off of the stroller. There is no way you could do it and not wake a sleeping baby. Ultimately I had to disconnect the car seat from the stroller and turn it upside down and use a screwdriver to trigger the lock release. (No the baby wasn\u2019t in the car seat when this happened) also the shocks are awful. You can feel every single crack in the sidewalk as you stroll which makes the stroller feel wobbly. Further, I\u2019m average height 5\u20195\u201d my husband is 6\u20191\u201d, either way with our differing heights we both still kicked the under part of the stroller when we would walk, which is very annoying. Lastly the storage compartment is small and flimsy. It never really took shape or firmness back. Things kept falling out of the bag as we\u2019d go over bumps. All and all I\u2019d say invest in something else. We ended up biting the bullet and investing in the V2 and couldn\u2019t be any happier.",
