Designed for the future in every possible way, all the soft fabric is made from recycled water bottles. Plastic drinking bottles are sorted, cleaned and shredded into flakes that become the yarn the seat fabric is made from. A great choice for your child and the planet, this versatile wagon features two cushioned seats with three-point safety harnesses for security while the removable center console with two cup holders and storage pocket allows kids to share snacks, toys and drinks. Two additional cup holders for parents and side pockets ensure you can bring everything you need along for the adventure. The removable, UV blocking canopy and roll-down shades offer privacy and protection from the sun or rain. Easy to drive, it features swivel front wheels that allow you to effortlessly turn and pivot, as well as push and pull leatherette handles with adjustable heights. The wagon\u2019s compact fold makes it easy to store or transport. And when your children outgrow the need for a wagon, use it to haul your own gear at the farmers market, while gardening or the grocery store. Holds up to 110 lbs. (55 lbs. per seat). Weighs 38 lbs. Recommended for ages 9 months up to 55 lbs.",

Yes the reviews are accurate about the handle bar not being stiff like orders but it is because they bend in order to be sealed. It came already assembled except the top which comes prepared just has to be hooked to the actual stroller wagon, light weight and compactable. If you are looking for am affordable wagon that us useful and looks great, do it!",

Only thing I don\u2019t like is how heavy it is but everything else is so awesome it doesn\u2019t even matter ! If your looking for a good wagon at a decent price this is the one !

The wheels lock up and the maneuverability is Terrible :( the rest of it was such good quality, and cute design, so I\u2019m really sad I got a defective one when others have raved abt it in their reviews. Started a return",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We needed a sturdy wagon for our two toddlers and this is PERFECT. This is my first video product review because I am so excited about it. We got as a Christmas present and it exceeded expectations - so we\u2019re opening and using early. Great storage, overhead and side panels, buckles for seat belts, cup holders, and truly sturdy wheels for beach trips. Highly recommend!!",
