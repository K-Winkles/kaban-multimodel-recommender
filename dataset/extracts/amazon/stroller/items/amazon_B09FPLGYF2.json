                "reviewText": "Definitely worth the purchase! Stroller is super light, easy to open and close with only one hand and comfortable enough that my toddler could nap on-the-go in the stroller while we were out and about on our trip. The handle bar in the seat was fun for my toddler to hold onto and we used it to put her feet up when they were napping so their feet weren\u2019t dangling off the edge of the seat in that uncomfortable way. We got rained on three days in a row and every night, the stroller air dried so quickly and without any problems.I do wish the basket at the bottom was a little bigger but that\u2019s just a personal preference. I became an expert at fitting as many things as I possibly could fit into that basket compartment and it did tear a liiiittle in one of the corners but it still stood strong and held everything well.Also, we\u2019re used to bigger wheels on our regular stroller so it took some getting used to with these smaller wheels but a few hours into our first day with the stroller and I was very used to the stroller\u2019s way of getting around. It\u2019s very smooth and definitely was worth the extra cost to buy a travel stroller that was easy on-the-go. This definitely fulfilled that and now we have a great product that we\u2019ll be able to use for future trips.We actually saw a couple of families with this same stroller when we went on our trip and they looked to be enjoying the product as well.",

                "reviewText": "Travelled with a 3 month old from the US to the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK. Multiple stops in each location, and traveled by plane, train, ferry, and rental car. This stroller suited all our needs and handles everything extremely well. It fit between the seats in planes, and folds up enough to be stowed in the overhead compartment. Lightweight, easy to manuever, as well as fold open and close at a moments notice. My wife and I are super happy we went with this stroller.There are a couple of improvements that could be made. There is no padding, so it would be uncomfortable for a baby without a blanket to lay on, a foam pad down in would easily solve this problem. Additionally, the extender handle wasn't made well and fully pulled out and was difficult to reinstert.My wife and I are also shorter people, but our tall friends 6'+ had a hard time towing the stroller when it was collapsed. We had no issues like that.Still, for extensive travel, this stroller was a champ!",

                "reviewText": "The stroller is alright. It\u2019s lightweight, easy to use and very convenient to carry around. However, if you\u2019re taller then 5\u20198 I wouldn\u2019t recommend. The handles don\u2019t rise so when walking it kinda puts you at an odd angle. I live in Germany and the stroller on cobblestone isn\u2019t so easy. But on pavement it\u2019s so smooth. The strollers materials and straps are kind of flimsy. They\u2019re good for traveling but maybe not everyday use. The straps feel cheaper then a dollar store book bag and if you have an alligator rolling child fastening them in will be frustrating due to all the small pieces that have to connect. But if you\u2019re looking for a good quick stroller, it\u2019ll work great!",

I wanted a stroller that was lightweight, easy to maneuver, and could withstand the cobblestone streets. This stroller checked all of those boxes!

I originally got it just for travel but it\u2019s now our main stroller since it\u2019s so small, and our baby likes to hold onto the handle.I will say I\u2019m afraid it will break if we gate check it, so I always put it overhead on planes. The gate agents have tried to argue with me about it but I don\u2019t bring any other carry-ons, just this little guy, and they let me.",

                "reviewText": "We got this to bring on our cruise with our 11m old. It folds VERY small, we brought on the plane as a carry on and fit up in the overhead bin no problem. My baby loves hanging on the handle bars and pushing the stroller with them too when we were waiting in the airport. The lightweight and narrowness of this is so great!A few cons, it does feel very cheap and lightweight compared to our main stroller. It doesn\u2019t recline all the way, and the cover does not cover really at all. It might cover a bigger kid but not our baby. The stroller wheels are definitely worn just after 1 week of use.I think any other umbrella stroller feels the same, I guess the price is just for the compact ability of this. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth the price though.",

He\u2019s in a wheelchair and when I needed to fly for a work trip I was reluctant to travel with his wheelchair. Airlines are famous for not taking very good care of wheelchairs and seeing that this folded up to the size of a carry-on and the handle folds out for easy wheeling I had to try it. It worked out perfect! I was able to wheel him right onto the plane and the stroller easily folded up and fit in the overhead bin! It\u2019s lightweight and easy to steer with one hand. The only downside is there\u2019s no parent storage pouch so you can\u2019t just throw your wallet or cellphone in the little storage part by the handle. But otherwise it has been perfect",
