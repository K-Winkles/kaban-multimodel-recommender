                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller specifically for an international flight with my toddler, and I must say, it served its purpose wonderfully. Here's what I appreciated about it:Streamlined and Simple Design: This stroller is refreshingly basic in its construction, which turned out to be perfect for our international travel needs. Sometimes, simplicity is exactly what you need, and this stroller delivered on that front.Compact and Nimble: Navigating through crowded airport facilities can be quite the challenge, but this stroller's small and agile design made it a breeze. Maneuvering it through bustling terminals and tight spaces was a cinch, even when I was traveling alone with my child. It is also easy to fold.Space Efficiency: One of the major reasons I opted for this stroller was its space efficiency. Bulkier strollers would have been a logistical nightmare during our travels. This one struck the right balance between functionality and portability.However, there are a couple of minor downsides to note:Storage Limitations: Unfortunately, the stroller lacks storage space underneath the seat, a feature that many strollers typically offer. This means you'll need to find an alternative storage solution for your essentials.Missing Cup Holder: Another minor drawback is the absence of a cup holder, which can be quite handy for parents on the go. Be prepared to carry a separate cup holder accessory or find an alternative way to keep your drinks within reach.In conclusion, this stroller proved to be a reliable companion for our international adventure, offering convenience and portability when we needed it most. While it may have some minor limitations in terms of storage and cup holder options, its compact design and ease of use make it a valuable addition for any parent navigating the challenges of air travel with a little one.",

Most parents I know end up using their umbrella stroller more than their regular stroller system just because how easy and lightweight they are. I am no different and wanted a stroller that is lightweight and easy to use. The Pamo Babe umbrella stroller is lightweight and simple to use. The stroller shade is the main reason I got this one vs. another umbrella stroller. Only thing I would love to add is a cup holder or small storage area under the seat.

A cross bar in the bottom would help it feel more fully extended and maybe less like a doll stroller? But hey it does the job lol! Also came with no instructions but it\u2019s pretty self explanatory.",

So that was disappointing Also, the front wheels say that there\u2019s . treading. When I opened it along with someone else, we both did not see any sort of trading on the wheels. It was clearly just a line from the seam creating the wheel. Another reason I purchased the item.One other thing the handles are very poor quality. They are equivalent to an old doll stroller that we have from 20 years ago. When you go to maneuver the stroller, they bend the canopy is nice and color is lovely. The straps seem to be great.",
