However it is difficult to steer, it kind of just veers off in whatever direction it wants to and to correct if you have to put a lot of muscle into it. We took it to the aquarium in Monterey and my arms definitely got a workout. The basket storage on the bottom is very large but it\u2019s difficult to get a diaper bag in it. I have the fawn design large diaper bag and it did not fit. I also have the mini fawn diaper bag and it fit well hanging off the handlebar but if the child in front gets out the stroller will tip back. We had to make sure to move the diaper bag to the front seat when our daughter got out of the front seat.",
