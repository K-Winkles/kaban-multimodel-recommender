                "reviewText": "Really like this travel system. The colors and vibrant, the baby fits it in great, it's easy to put her in the seat and also to put the seat into the stroller to go walking. The baby latches into the car seat easy and it's easy to get the babies car seat out of the booster restraint. I have two complaints. The first one is it was hard to follow the directions to put it together to put the stroller together. At least it was for me. I ordered one a year and a half ago and ordered the second one 3 months ago thinking I wouldn't have to buy another base for my case since the two I purchased were going in car for two grandchildren. Could you help me understand why the second one which is identical to the first one would not fit the base on the second one? It's evident I liked the stroller to have purchased two of them but had already gotten rid of the box it came in since I bought it a couple of months before she was due so neither of us had used it in a car yet. Did you make a change in the base structure???? This was one of the main reason I bought the second one the same as the first so I wouldn't have to buy an extra base for my car. Interesting enough, when I came back to read my review, it was dated October 2022 and the date today is July 12, 2023.",
