        "description": "Product Description The TRE Jogging Stroller from Chicco is designed to keep up with fast-paced families from everyday outings all the way to race day. A lightweight aluminum frame, sleek three-wheel design, deceleration hand brake, and 16\" pneumatic rear tires make it easy to maneuver. And dual FlexCore suspension adjusts for smooth or rugged terrain.For smaller babies, the TRE accepts all KeyFit and Fit2 infant car seats (sold separately). For added convenience, the stroller seat and backrest detach easily in one piece, along with the canopy, leaving behind a lightweight frame stroller. As baby grows, a five-point harness, multi-position backrest and water-resistant fabrics help create a comfortable and secure environment for continued strolling or jogging. A full-coverage canopy with a zippered extension panel and flippable mesh vent/tinted window provides comfortable shade from the sun.For unmatched convenience, the TRE features an exclusive control console with hand-operated functionality that\u2019s easy to access while strolling. The front swivel wheel can be locked/unlocked from the console for on-the-go adjustment. The deceleration brake is also controlled from the console and doubles as a fixed brake for parking. A padded push handle, soft parent tray with two cup holders, and large storage basket provide added convenience.TRE conveniently folds with one hand into three compact configurations: the standing fold is perfect for the garage; the front swivel wheel easily folds down to create a flat fold for the trunk; and quick-release wheels reduce the footprint for longterm closet storage.

                "reviewText": "I've been an avid jogger for the last several years, so a jogging stroller was a must have item after my daughter was born. I spent several days researching the various options available on the market and took a trip to Babies R Us to see some of the strollers in person. Of all of the strollers I tested out, the Chicco Tre had the best build quality of the bunch. It's even nicer than the pricier BOBs in my opinion. It's heavy, but I view that as a good thing. The bearings are solid and the locking mechanism for the front wheel is very sturdy.It has several features that I really appreciate:1) It folds up very compactly considering its size. I drive a sedan and it fits in my trunk. The folding mechanism is easy to use and can be operated with one hand.2) The brake and parking brake are super handy - no worrying about the stroller rolling or picking up too much speed on hills3) The tires are easy to inflate and hold air well.4) The parent tray isn't large, but it can fit my phone, keys, and little one's pacifier, which is all I need it to do5) The suspension is adjustable and works like a charm. Our area is wooded and our driveway unpaved, so I needed a stroller that would take the bumps and not jostle my daughter too much.6) My Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat snaps in and out very easily.7) The stroller rolls smoothly and isn't cumbersome to run with. It provided a bit of resistance that I was unaccustomed to, but that's to be expected.The stroller wasn't difficult to put together, but my husband did spend a good hour getting it dialed in and adjusting the brakes. Probably not really necessary, but he's a mechanic by trade and small details matter to him.Overall I love it!",

                "reviewText": "We ordered a damaged box product & got a bit of a discount. I thought my husband was certifiably insane for wanting to spend $400 on a stroller, but I'm completely impressed. Assembly was mostly intuitive, with a few weird spots. I can never seem to do the \"one hand opening\" which is my only complaint -- and that's a minor one. It is somewhat bulky & heavy, but it's sturdy! Even though I have to launch it into the back of the cars, it takes the licking and keeps on...looking brand new. Wild. My husband has a van, so space is no big deal. I have a Toyota compact SUV with a small hatchback type space & it fits just fine without having to take anything off or do any crazy configurations. The cargo basket is underwhelming, but the standard diaper bag (\"Big Lady\") fits on it's side. Our smaller backpack style diaper bag slides in. Cargo is surprisingly secure. The cup holder piece at the handlebar is ...eh... OK. It will hold 2 water bottles & keys/phone, but it bounces a lot so coffee in a paper cup with a flimsy lid is not such a great idea. LOVE the sun/weather shade. We took Babe to a holiday festival and it ended up pouring rain & sleet. She stayed dry & could still see things happening in front of her.I've owned several jogging strollers over the last 20 years & this one is the Big Daddy. We've had it on streets, sidewalks, in parades, in sun, snow, sleet & rain, hiking & flat trails, shopping & running errands, at fairgrounds, state parks, beaches, church and just about everywhere that we can walk. It's a little bulky for inside things (some doors aren't wide enough, but if they are legal for wheelchairs it has no issue there) but it maneuvers like a dream so the size isn't a true issue unless you're stuck in a weird aisle or doorway. Babe loves it so much more than her normal chicco, because she's up higher & can sit straighter.tl;dr: worth it. You won't be disappointed.",

So easy to fold and maneuver.We bought this stroller to fit with our Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat. Fits perfectly and is very easy to set up. It rides so smooth and was definitely worth the money. We did not necessarily buy it for jogging but we live in the country on a gravel road and have trails throughout our land that my husband and I love to walk and wanted to be able to take our daughter with us. It works perfectly for going through our rough terrain. It is heavy to put in/out of the car but the quality is fantastic. I have used it for shopping and found it very easy to maneuver throughout the stores I went in. Would 100% buy again!",

Only bigger issue is how large it still is folded down. It literally takes up my whole trunk and I cannot put other things in there. Small issue is bringing it into store, tires tend to hit things around.",

                "reviewText": "I love this stroller. Not sure how it measures up for legit jogging (I chose it because we have a vacation spot with a lot of gravel roads), but it\u2019s extremely smooth, much lighter and easier to maneuver than I expected it would be. It\u2019s a jogger, so it\u2019s not small, but it folds easily and fits in the trunk of my Jeep Grand Cherokee with room to spare. Side note - if you use it with the Chicco Keyfit 30 infant seat, you can remove the big kid seat without having to remove the storage below or the super nice and huge visor. I recommend removing the Chicco-branded fabric that\u2019s wrapped around the bumper bar for when you\u2019re using it with the Keyfit. It snaps in and out much easier without the fabric in the way, and it can be put back on the bar when you\u2019re ready to use it with the bigger kid seat. Highly recommend - surprised it\u2019s not more popular than it is, but I\u2019m also a fan of not having the same stroller as every other suburban mom, so win win.",
