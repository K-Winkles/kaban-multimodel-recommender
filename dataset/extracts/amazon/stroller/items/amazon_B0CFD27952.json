                "reviewText": "I got this umbrella stroller for my baby so I\u2019d have an alternative to the heavier strollers that have the bassinet pieces, etc. I needed something that also takes up less room in my car too.This was the perfect option and it\u2019s stylish too!!It was easy to assemble for the pieces needing to be put together and it works exactly as intended for an umbrella stroller. I love the colors and the design too. The stroller works with no issues and my baby is comfortable sitting in it. The handlebars are also made well and are comfortable too.The only thing I would like to see with this stroller is the option to have a tray attachment or something. It would make it easy to put my baby\u2019s things (toys, snacks, etc) on when going out and about for the day.Other than that it\u2019s definitely a good buy and no complaints here!",

                "reviewText": "We have a fancy, full size baby stroller that we use as our \u201cdaily driver, \u201c but we also always keep this smaller \u201cUmbrella\u201d stroller in the car. Its smaller size makes it ideal for navigating through the small aisles of stores in the mall. It\u2019s also very portable once collapsed -- as long as we don\u2019t overload its under basket with more than the basics, it can be folded down and easily carried by its handle when our toddler feels like getting out and walking.The only downside is that it\u2019s not as comfortable to turn and use as a \u201cbig\u201d stroller, and the unlocking mechanism for collapsing it is a little tricky. I always forget how to close it.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller looks and feels deluxe in its construction and safety features. It is very easy to assemble, you simply snap on the four wheels that are secured with a hole in the sturdy metal with an attached silver dowel. I did have to look up how to fold the stroller, there is a plastic mechanism in the back that you can lift up with your foot that slides up smoothly, and a lever on the right that is pushed down to fold it in. There is also a step on the side for easy carrying. The stroller is lightweight and is only 15 lbs, it can hold up to 50 lbs. The stroller hood has a rating of 20 spf, it is deep and provides great coverage for the kiddo. There is also a cup holder that can be snapped onto the left handle. The umbrella is of high quality in all of the pieces, the metal of the structure, the heavy canvas of the seat and hood, and the padding of the straps. It has brakes on all 4 wheels, the front ones can be used to make for a smoother ride on bumpy surfaces. The under-stroller area is deep and can fit a backpack/diaper bag. It does not appear like the designers forgot anything. The ride is smooth and easy to push.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice quality stroller, and it has a lot of extra features that a standard umbrella stroller does not. Those added features also add some weight to it though. It's not like it's super heavy, it's just heavier than a typical umbrella stroller. (15lbs vs 7lbs) I guess it depends what you mean by 'travel'. If you're throwing it in your car, for farmers markets & things, this is great! If you're hoping for air travel, the extra weight makes it less convenient. Again, not terrible, just not 'max-lite'. I think the price is a bit high, compared to comparable models, so maybe not a very good value.",
