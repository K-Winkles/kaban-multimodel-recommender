                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased this same stroller multiple times over the years for my 6 kids.Pros: it is super lightweight, compact, easy to fold and open, and comfortable for the kids!!!Cons: it\u2019s sturdy, but not all THAT sturdy. This is definitely not designed to be an every day stroller.I have purchased this for various vacations to both our local beach/boardwalk and Walt Disney World.It is unbeatable for the price, in my opinion.It\u2019s got better features than a lot of other double umbrella strollers on the market for this price, including better canopies, good harnesses and roomy, comfy seats for the kids.When you\u2019ve got 6 kids, luggage and a million things to worry about in the airport, this stroller gives you one less thing to worry about. It doesn\u2019t take up much space, super easy to check on the plane, and it gives you somewhere safe and comfy to keep the smaller kids during your travels.My kids also were comfortable enough to nap in this stroller during our long days at the Florida theme parks.These strollers do, however, break rather easily with daily wear and tear. Though it lasted no problem during the trips, if we used it every day for walks at home, we\u2019d experience different issues from wheels breaking, the seats wearing thin around the metal support beams, etc.If you plan to use it for vacations only, I could see it lasting a few trips. But with daily use, it probably could last 6 months to maybe a year at very most.Still, this is my favorite stroller for travel and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, go for it! (If you\u2019re traveling to Disney, make sure to buy a stroller bag for the airport and a rain cover too! \ud83d\ude09)",

                "reviewText": "We had the graco duoglider and I HATED it. Oh man it's big and bulky and hard to maneuver. I NEEDED something smaller and much more lightweight because I take the kiddos for a lot of walks and I was just so tired of trying to push that hulking thing around.This side by side stroller is a million times better. It has fit through every doorway we've tried and it can turn on a dime(we do a lot of circles to keep the banies happy when we have to stop). It even offroads well lol.I love the five point harnesses and the seats are comfy. The sun shade is small. But for this price, we just bought a shade extender and still saved money. The overall quality is beyond my expectations. I expected it to be kind of flimsy or unsteady but it is very very sturdy and seems very well put together.It's so small for a double stroller! It folds up so compact and saves us a ton a of room in our trunk!The cup holder kind of sucks but that's not a problem for us at all. We usually have water Bottles so we can just stick them in one of the decent sized pouches hanging from the back.All in all I'm very satisfied with this stroller and I'm beyond glad that I made the switch!",

                "reviewText": "I would like to say that this came already put together and all I had to do was snap 2 wheels on it. That alone was worth the money to me because I don\u2019t have much time to spend putting a bunch of stuff together, so I was impressed right away. It\u2019s very lightweight, easy to fold and carry, and it rides pretty smooth. It has mesh pockets on the back of each seat for storage. It did come with a cup holder but I\u2019ve found it doesn\u2019t stay on so I just took it off and use the storage space for any bottles.Now for the few cons. The handles on it are a little awkward and I feel if you are above 5\u20197 it wouldn\u2019t work well for you. Sometimes I find myself hunched over a bit just trying to push it because the handles are so low. I would avoid buying this one if you\u2019re any taller unless you don\u2019t mind back pain after 30 minutes of walking. The next thing is that it does NOT fit through a normal doorway easily. It\u2019s a hassle getting in and out of my front door any time I take the kids for a walk. So that\u2019s a bit frustrating. Another small thing is the straps are a little hard to adjust, at least on mine. The part where you\u2019re supposed to pull to make it looser is hard to get ahold of and it was pretty frustrating for me because I finally got it after trying for a week. It\u2019s almost like it was put on backwards or something and if you have even the slightest \u201cbig\u201d hands or fingers you most likely will struggle getting it.Overall those are pretty minor things for me, it fits both of my kids and the positive things make it worth it. Especially for how inexpensive it is, you can\u2019t really beat it",
