I love that it's versatile, in that it's forward or rear facing and it's easy to switch between the two. We're fairly tall so I especially love the height. The wheels are great they are bigger than most strollers out there which makes steering seamless on all terrains, we've tried. It seems like they are similar to a jogging stroller's wheels. The storage space underneath, is decent and it's easy to grab things from there. I really recommend this stroller. It's not a brand I recognize and it was on the cheaper end so I was skeptical but I'm in love with it!",
