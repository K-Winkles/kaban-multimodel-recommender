I just assembled it myself today and it was simple to snap the wheels in place and just add the cup holder bars and sun shades. I was expecting my daughter to use the stand option as she's a little old for a standard stroller but she loved the look of the back seat so she climbed in \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. She loves it that way and the stroller is bigger than I expected so it holds her small frame with no problem with the baby's car seat in the front seat. Now we just wait for baby brother to come and enjoy the ride.",
