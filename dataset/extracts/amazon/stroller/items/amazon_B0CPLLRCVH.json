I have the TBG x Veer Switchback Off-Road Stroller. This wound easily around the bumper bar and stayed in place well. It's been SO nice being able to take a sippy cup and some light snacks on our morning walks. I think this is of great value and is a great option for anyone who doesn't want to splurge on a pricy name brand attachment.",

This tray attachment is as close to perfect as I could get until my 19 mth old figured out that if she keeps turning the tray, it eventually comes off. Luckily as long as there are snacks or water bottle in it, she leaves it alone. Other times I store below.Overall, this is a really great snack tray. Very simple to put on and it stays in place when filled. I really like that the compartments are deep enough to keep the bottle and food in without being so deep she can\u2019t get to them.",

Though it is excellent in being compact when folded, it lacks in storage space and does not have a snack tray. I was looking to add a snack try and came across this product. What I like is the snake-like wire mount. It reminds me of those stroller fans or camera tripods with the snake-like wire legs. You basically wrap it around any bar and it will hold. In contrast, others uses a clip on mount. I feel the snake-like mount is more sturdy and can be adjusted more. With a snack tray in place, I can have a place to hold my daughter's sippy cup and an area to place her snacks. I really like this accessory!",
