                "reviewText": "Stroller was easy to put together and we are enjoying using it. The mechanism to fold it can be done with one hand, however, it is a bit too heavy to lift into the car's trunk with one hand . The design is sleek. We're in between using the carseat and just sitting in the stroller. The harness system is the only negative so far. It does not stay together easily and is a bit of a struggle between holding a wiggly, perhaps not happy baby, and piecing together the five point harness- each time. It may not be a big deal once we do not have to use the five points and can just use the lap harness. Still looks new after months of dirt road walks. Lots of room for water bottles for all involved and the storage basket below is large. I often use it instead of a cart at the grocery store. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried 5 different strollers before finding this one lol. Some not to buy - The mini version of this - the wheels broke in a month, A cool lightweight one from Amazon that was amazing but didn\u2019t sit up right, and the graco modes which was a wobbly piece of junk.This one is amazing. Cup holders for both mom and baby. Nice handlebar for me. Phone holder. Big sturdy wheels that aren\u2019t going to break and can handle rough terrain. Big underneath compartment for a large diaper bag. The seat goes fully upright and reclines with a nice lever instead of a flimsy string (what the more compact ones have). Smoooooth ride.For the 100-300 price point this is the absolute best stroller on the market. You need it. And my next baby car seat can click right in.The ONLY con would be it\u2019s heavy when it\u2019s folded up who cares it\u2019s my new arm workout!!",

                "reviewText": "Haven\u2019t put it together yet, may update later, but so far:PROS: 1) Cleartex material is great, very reduced smell, 2) folds wellCONS: Heavy and not compact, it says easy folding which is technically true but I was expecting something lighter when advertised as such. Would not recommend this for a travel system, its weigh and bulk are something more for use in the local neighborhood or in/out of the trunk. Flying / going through the airport with this would be a nightmare.Torn between keeping it because of the weight, but the material is great and it fits the car seat.",
