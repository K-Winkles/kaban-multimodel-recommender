                "reviewText": "I was looking for a stroller that is practical, can grow with my baby & NOT bulky or hard to assemble and fold. You can do it with one hand really. And when it folds, it doesn't take up too much space like the Graco stroller I had with my 1st baby. I love that you can remove the seat to forward face when he's an infant and rear face as he grows. Definitely wish I had this with my first! It includes a mesh cover which is nice too. The wheels run smooth and turn nicely. If you're debating-- GET IT!!! I LOVE MINE.",

                "reviewText": "First off, don't make the mistake I made when first assembling it. There is a video here about the side where it connects to the frame and make sure it clicks before installing the seat. I put it in at first without seeing this and the seat kept flipping without locking in place which got me upset at first. Once you flip these sides, it will remain stable when clicked into the frame.He is 9 months old and the cover folds down pretty well over him if you unzip the hood. I haven't tried the mesh for bugs that came with it but is a nice add on. It also has little clips on the side which you can use to keep a stroller bag more stable so that it does not slip down. At the bottom front wheels, there are locks but it is under the wheel so feel down there for a little button. The main brake is on the side of the adult push handle. The ones in the front add a little peace of mind if you are concerned but the back alone does work well.Overall, fairly happy with this and folds down well to keep in the car. Reclines all the way back for sleepy baby time. Rides fairly smoothly but do not have a lot of rough terrain around me to try out the suspension.Price seems a little up there but decent quality. Make sure to read the instructions and watch the video. I have used tons of strollers and that side clip turn till it clicks before installation was a new one to me.",

I love that the seat is easy to recline, the leg area is adjustable, but the seat can also be reversed to face you. The top shade is normal shade, but if you unzip the shade it offers twice the sun protection!!! The bar is easy to lift to get baby in and out. It has a good 5 point harness system. This stroller rides so smooth! The only downside I see is that there are no cup holders for baby or parent, but that can be an easy accessory later. I am in love with this stroller and feel for the quality that it is, it will last for forever!",
