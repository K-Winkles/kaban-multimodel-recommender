                "reviewText": "My recent experience with the Lortsybab 2-in-1 Baby Stroller left me thoroughly disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns:Construction and Durability: Its construction is weak and subpar. The stroller feels flimsy and not as sturdy as one would expect, especially when it comes to a product meant to ensure the safety and comfort of a baby. Maybe suitable for 0-3 months, but I wouldn't recommend it for a baby older than that. The carrier wiggles a lot and is held by cheap pieces of plastic. If those pieces were to break, the carrier will tilt, which is extremely worrying to put a baby in one of these. The lack of robustness and the carrier's instability raise doubts about its durability and long-term use.Bassinet Mode Inefficiency: The promise of a \"2-in-1\" stroller with a bassinet mode was intriguing, but the execution fell short of expectations. The bassinet mode is far from comfortable for a baby. The lack of adequate padding and support made me question whether it's suitable for extended use, particularly for newborns who require utmost comfort and security.Difficulty in Maneuvering: Maneuvering this stroller proved to be a cumbersome task. The wheels did not glide smoothly, making it a struggle to push the stroller, especially on uneven surfaces. This lack of maneuverability can be frustrating for parents trying to navigate various terrains.Lack of Practical Features: I found the stroller lacking in practical features that are often considered essential for baby strollers. These missing elements include proper storage options for baby essentials, sunshade effectiveness, and adjustable seating positions for the baby's comfort.Furthermore, I encountered significant issues after returning the item. Regrettably, I didn't receive a refund, despite following the return process correctly. To add to the frustration, Amazon's customer service was unhelpful in resolving the matter. This added inconvenience only exacerbated the disappointment associated with this purchase.The Lortsybab 2-in-1 Baby Stroller with Bassinet Mode failed to meet my expectations on multiple fronts. Its questionable construction, inefficiencies in bassinet mode, difficulty in maneuvering, and lack of practical features make it an unsuitable choice for parents seeking a reliable and safe stroller for their baby. I would strongly recommend exploring other options in the market for a more reliable and baby-friendly stroller. While I appreciate the concept, the execution leaves much to be desired, and the lack of adequate customer support further sours the experience.",
