My 4 year old hated our other attachments to ride on in our other double. He couldn\u2019t sit, didn\u2019t have anything to hold while standing.. and so he walked until I eventually had to hold him and push.Not with the Bravo though! The sitting assembly is amazing for either one of my two (2 year old or 4 year old) and the standing assembly is great because either can hold onto something (handles) while being pushed. Wishing I had bought this years ago! Just buy it!!",

It worked well it could use more storage underneath but the toddler seat just makes it hard to get things in and out. It\u2019s very heavy lol easy enough to fold up but lord it\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s a double stroller essentially so it\u2019s easy enough to maneuver around but it\u2019s still kind of a boat.",

                "reviewText": "Great double stroller, particularly for the price. Our 2 year old loves the choice to stand or sit while the baby is in the front in the car seat. Can't beat the click in keyfit30 for under 6 months! Also love that it maintains the one handed fold. Cons: the 2nd rear facing seat has no back, so 2nd child must be able to reliably sit on own; therefore ideal for toddler/baby 2 toddler combo. The cup holders don't fit any of our thermoses or water bottles (contigo and camelbak); neither does our regular chicco bravo stroller and I am dissapointed with that feature in both. But overall, with the only complaint being cupholder sizing, this is clearly an excellent stroller overall!",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is perfect for my growing family. I have a 2 year old and she lost interest quickly in sitting in her stroller. So the fact that she can stand on this is perfect. There are little hand holders for her to hold on to something while on the road. It\u2019s very easy to fold, you literally click one button. And I love this car seat! It is so light. Also the little undercarriage is a nice size and fits my bag perfectly. Prior to this one I had the britax bsafe car seat and stroller and I hated it everything about.",

Folds super easy, reasonable weight for a double stroller. Extremely compact when open vs competition. Extra storage is there but barely handles a small diaper bag. Happy to trade that for the compactness and maneuverability this stroller offers",

Has a clean look to it and definitely going to last me . My son who is over 40 pounds and is pretty tall for his age fit in the toddler seat just fine . My daughters car seat fits in perfectly . I have also used the front chair with the food tray . Although it doesn\u2019t recline all the way back it reclines just enough that each child has room .Best decision ever getting this stroller.",
