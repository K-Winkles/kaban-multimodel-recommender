Closes into a compact size no bigger than my child's space saver Fisher Price high chair. Easy to manuver, my 5 year old can easily push the baby (supervised). The leg rests adjust with the click on the buttons on side and can be positioned flat or slightly downwards. Back rest looks a little awkward with the canopy shade when reclined all the way up, but will recline to a low position for resting. I bought an extra stroller organizer for a sturdier cupholder and pocket for items. Bottom storage basket is huge and nice to fit diaper bag or shopping items. Good purchase for infant to growing toddler.",

You can push ONE HANDED which is a must when you\u2019re traveling through an airport. Takes up very little space in the car. The cup holder is removable and can be used on either side of the stroller which is very useful. You do need to use 2 hands to recline the seat, and put it back together, also, when you fold the stroller to make sure the latch clips or un clips you\u2019ll need both hands. Overall, a really great travel stroller, especially for the price!",

The seat is pretty padded & comfy and it gives our guy the \u2018private space\u2019 he needs sometimes in loud/busy settings.***update*** we used this for a long airplane trip through two major airports and it worked great, and fit in the overhead bin. I did purchase a stroller bag to stow it in so that it wouldn\u2019t be spotted and get gate checked, it looks a little bulky when not in a bag so I recommend doing the same.Unfortunately during an unrelated mall outing my two year old somehow snapped the back in half so it can no longer be used. It didn\u2019t last quite a year. With the frequency we find ourselves still needing a stroller like this we\u2019ll be replacing it with something a little sturdier",

We loved how easy it was to fold down and carry onto the transportation buses. It rolled with ease as well and held up on all those long walks around the parks and resorts. We loved the extra compartment bag on the back of the stroller and the bottom compartment held a lot as well. Most importantly it was comfortable for my toddler to take naps in while on the go, it reclines all the way down and love that you can extend the bottom to not have their legs dangling while napping. This stroller was game changer for us!",

It folds and unfolds easily, and is lightweight enough to carry with one hand. Once unfolded, it doesn't feel flimsy, has sturdy back support, and my daughter is comfortable in it. We've taken it on walks on pretty uneven terrain, and it never felt rickety or like it was getting loose/damaged. The ONE negative I have for it is that the buckle to lower/lift the back of the seat can get stuck from time to time while you're moving it.",

Which that broke during our trip in Europe the cup holder is really weak and straps are not that great and if your child is a toddler or tall like ours they won\u2019t really fit even if you lift the feet thing. We had to company again because it damaged over there and we basically had no stroller coming back and had to figure out what to do and make a broken stroller work some how for the 18 hour travel and 2 flights.",
