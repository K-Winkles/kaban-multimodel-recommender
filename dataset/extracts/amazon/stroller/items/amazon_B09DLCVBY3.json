I'm very glad I got it and at the price I got it, it looks more expensive.Be careful when unpacking, the material looks to be linen, don't pull the cardboard attach to it, grab a scissor and gently snip it off, otherwise your at risk of damaging the fabric, if it were plastic (synthetic) it wouldn't be a problem but thank God it isn't, so be careful when unpacking.",

The other thing I wish is that the design was on both sides of each hanging toy. It\u2019s annoying that they often hang so that my baby just sees the back. Otherwise very cute and nice theme.",
