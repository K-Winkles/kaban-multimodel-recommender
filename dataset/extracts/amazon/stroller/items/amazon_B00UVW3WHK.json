It matches with our car seat so all I have to do is take the car seat off the base in my car and click it into the stroller. I love that I can do this one handed and that it is a breeze when I am out with my baby by myself. It can be steered with one hand and also set up with one hand as there is a release button that is pushed and then unfolded. Similarly it can easily be folded and fits in my backseat behind the passenger side seat.",

My baby bag barely fits, I have to jam it in and it\u2019s hard to pull out quickly when I need something.",

                "reviewText": "As a FTM, you don't usually have a lot of extra time when caring for a newborn so the fact that I'm taking the time to write this review means that it's worth it. This is our second Graco stroller - we also have a jogger which we love, but is quite bulky if you're just going to do errands or need extra space in the trunk when travelling - so we decided to purchase this one as it claimed to be light, can be opened/closed with one hand and is compatible with all Graco click connect carseats. I would say it met all of those requirements and more! It surprisingly has good suspension (disclaimer: I haven't owned it very long so I'm not sure if this lasts, but again I won't be using it on everyday walks since we have the jogger) and most importantly, it was easy to assemble - everything just *clicks* into place!The only cons I would say is that:1) It took a few tries before getting the hang of opening and closing it (the release button jammed so we had to wriggle it a few times and reinstall the tray) and2) It's for infants, so we probably won't be using it for very long once our daughter no longer fits in her infant carseat. But.. for the price and convenience of having something more compact for our needs it's well worth it IMO so don't wait out on this stroller!",
