The fold feature is simple, it looks more on the high end side with out the price tag. It\u2019s easy to push one handed too. Love the pull out handle so you can wheel it behind you if needed. I purchased the tray in my photo separately as my baby is big on snacks right now. Overall a great buy for the price. I\u2019ve seen similar options for 200+ for \u201cbrand\u201d name.",

The best part is that it goes on the plane with you. So you don\u2019t have to worry about the child during lay overs. One of the best purchase I made for my child.",

                "reviewText": "Had purchased a similar stroller but the storage basket was inaccessible and would not sit up or recline enough. This one reclines back enough for a child to sleep, and sits up enough so they aren\u2019t struggling to view their surroundings. The storage basket is big enough for a standard diaper bag. Folds up super compact! The only thing is the release to fold the stroller is a little hard. Great compact stroller!",
