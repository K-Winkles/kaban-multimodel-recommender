We used it heavily and it was very Comfortable, stylish and Practical option for us. Our daughter loved it. Easy to maneuver, comfortable, smooth ride, not easy to fold and unfold it though . We used it extensively during our travels afterwards. It broke down on our 3rd trip when the stick between 2 wheels came out. Bummer that it was lost during the flight and I can not find replacement parts anywhere making stroller useless. It lasted 5 months only for us.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So I just purchased it, I think it\u2019s beautiful and all just as excepted. However, I have some buts. First, it\u2019s not so light weight, appears quite heavy for me but I\u2019m still very glad I got it. And secondly, the instruction manual doesn\u2019t say how to stand it back. It tells you how to fold it but not how to get it to stand back up. I\u2019ve been battling with it for a while now and checked all YouTube videos with no help. Anyone could kindly tell me how cuz it\u2019s quite frustrating at this point. I recommend they include that in the manual also. Not all of us are tech savvy. EDIT: I eventually figured it out through the help of a friend almost one year and multiple flights later. lol everywhere we go, even in different countries, people always staring at it and making great comments about it. It\u2019s a show stopper. I\u2019ve re - edited to 5 stars from 4. Thanks for this great masterpiece. It\u2019s still strong as ever",
