We did have to buy a separate cup holder as the one that comes with it is flimsy and caused my drink to fall. Otherwise, it\u2019s a 10!",

It even has a cupholder! It folds and unfolds easily, is sturdy and well-made. There is a handle on one side for ease of carrying when folded. Wish I had bought this years ago!! I'm taking one star off for the weight, but it's a bit heavier than two of your typical Target umbrella strollers, because it's just much more sturdy. It's not heavy though, and certainly much lighter than my front-to-back double stroller that's sitting in my basement right now.",

Both of my kids were able to nap in it multiple times. The storage underneath is great, a lot bigger than I expected. We were able to fit our diaper bag and multiple other things underneath. Also has 2 large pockets on the back. My husband and I are 5\u20199 and 5\u201911 and we both thought it was very comfortable to push! Could not recommend it more!!",

I have a pupa baby vista, but for traveling, it\u2019s too heavy.We\u2019ve taken this stroller to Paris, Italy, all over Germany, we\u2019ve taken the train/metro and bus with it and it has served our family well. I\u2019ve used it for about a year now, and other than the cup holder being too flimsy, we love it.It reclines, so the kids can sleep, the baskets are decent sized, it fits our diaper bag, umbrella, water bottles\u2026 the only thing I\u2019d change is the canopy. Who\u2019s is why I removed 1 star. During the summer, it doesn\u2019t cover the kids from the sun, especially if the seats are reclined. More than half of their bodies are exposed, so we use lots of sunscreen and Muslim swaddles to cover them.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this stroller. It was easy to set up. It\u2019s light and quick to fold to put away. It fits through doorways and glides so smoothly. The handle for carrying is also the perfect height for my toddler to hold while I\u2019m pushing the twins. The seats recline separately so one babe can snooze while the other sits up. The big back storage pockets are great for holding my wallet, keys, and phone. I love this stroller.",

                "reviewText": "Update: the first stroller I ordered had a defect where one side wasn\u2019t secure and would try to partially fold up when I was pushing it with my child sitting in it. They sent me a free replacement, but then the second one started doing the same thing within 2-3 months. I only use the stroller every once in a while, so it hasn\u2019t been used very much. Maybe once a week I\u2019ll use it to take my babies to my older kids\u2019 sports events. It was outside of Amazon\u2019s return window, so I contacted the manufacturer and they told me they cant do anything. No refund or replacement. I ended up just ordering a different brand of double stroller .. I remember having a different double stroller about 7 years ago when my older kids were little, and it actually worked and lasted a long time with no issues. The strollers nowadays are cheaply made and break shortly after purchasing .. you would expect a stroller to last you years, rather than weeks or months.I bought this April 23, 2023. It is now May 31 and the product is broken. I am a mom of 4; two elementary kids close in age, then a one and two year old. My elementary kids do sports, so I bought this stroller to take the younger ones to watch their games. The stroller has probably gotten used about 8-10 times, for about 1-2 hours each time, and one half of the stroller is already broken. I sat my child on that side, and there seems to be an issue with the mechanism that keeps it in place; I was worried that it was going to fold up while my child was sitting there. This also made it very hard to push. Luckily I wasn\u2019t going a far distance. Previously, it was not too hard to push until it somehow quit working within a short period of time. I\u2019m grateful that the product is getting replaced for free. Aside from my product having defects, I like the stroller overall. It is lightweight and easy to assemble. There is a decent amount of storage space underneath.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to fold and transport, light weight, works great for my toddlers. Easy to steer. Moves easily on pavement and grass. Storage area is large and big enough for larger purse or diaper bag. There are storage areas as well behind the umbrella on each side of the stroller which are great for extra water bottles, phone, keys, etc. I would recommend this stroller! Great value for the money. So many other double strollers are $200-$300. This works great as I know in a year my kids will have outgrown it.",
