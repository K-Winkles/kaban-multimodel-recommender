It has been quite a while since I have been around this age group through my friends. I babysat for many of my friends because I get along with kids. This book gave me the sights and sounds of it again. Snow and summer, long sunsets, rain, new cut grass. The smell of kids both clean and dirty, running across the yard as soon as you show up. Quick calls to meet for breakfast, lunch or dinner with about 20 minutes notice. \"Yea I can meet you at Winsteads\".It brought that back but also a new appreciation for strollers. They are ubiqitious and status linked, I knew that, but I had never realized they were contraversial. It is impossible to have this 21st century life without them",

                "reviewText": "This is my first foray into Bloomsbury's \"Object Lessons\" series, and as such I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Stroller. I was quickly engaged with the book and ended up reading it in one sitting. The book includes a well-researched history of the object itself--stroller/pram/buggy--which was both surprising and informative. As much as I enjoyed reading about how strollers came to be and how their role in culture varies from place to place, though, I gravitated even more toward the personal vignettes in the book. With honesty and intelligence, Morgan looks at the symbolic connection between the stroller as a representation of connection, separation, and materialism within the context of her world as a mother, runner, consumer. The book is in turn funny, piercing, illuminating and ultimately quite moving. I had no idea that a stroller, in the right author's hands, would give me so much to think about.",

                "reviewText": "Review of Stroller by Amanda Parrish MorganWhen I bought Stroller, its short format made me hope that reading an \u201centire\u201d book without yawning or googling into the freefall associations of my brain chasing a stray fact down alleys to the whirlpool of Google web surfing. The book, Stroller, by Amanda Parrish Morgan, is the most recent printing for OBJECTLESSONS, \u201cA book series about the hidden lives of ordinary things\u201d from Bloomsbury Academic. Parrish Morgan\u2019s short book pulled - and pushed - me out of the rut of post-pandemic reading. And it did more; it introduced me to a new form of writing that combines scholarly attention with the evocative richness of memoir. In this case, the everyday object in the writer\u2019s lens is the smallest and most energy-efficient vehicle of all time: the baby stroller.This discussion ranges from interpretation of artistic and scholarly uses of strollers to experiences of the author. The effect is one of engaging the reader in close focus, attending to the object as a tool for its obvious purpose and also as metaphor -- finding the meaning the object carries for and about society. In this case, the object is the practical transport for infants and children. It (the stroller) is also a vehicle for mothers\u2019 fears, a consumer item of significant import about the purchasers, and an artifact of a consumer society. Additionally, the author opens her personal story. As a young mother in her early days as a parent, her life rotates (sometimes frenetically) around a demanding cycle of writing, running, teaching, and parenting. The focus on the stroller, a human-powered yet mechanical form of transport, appears -- at one level -- to be the purpose of writing. As the facts about the baby carriage roll out, however, the personal and social aspect reveal a larger purpose. With its interesting history and shiny future, the stroller is the focal point but hardly the only point of this book. For assessing today\u2019s consumer society and the role of affluence and status, branding and purchasing power in modern life, one could find no more apt vehicle. No matter how practical or down-to-earth an item may seem, data suggest that branding and marketing are as much a part of the product as its brakes, the color scheme, or, indeed, any feature. Parrish Morgan\u2019s work lead me first to question the role of branding and status in products advertised (!) for the safety of our children. The durable take-away from this book for me is larger: banana stains and mud splatters on the well-used stroller reveal a picture of parenting so strong and so tender that merchandizing is nowhere in the final equation. When I emerged from the fascinating trip, I did google \u2013 both for more info about strollers and also to find more writing by this gifted and dedicated author.",

I haven't encountered the same combination in other books I've read (I am new to the Object Lessons series), but it was very refreshing.Morgan seamlessly switches from historical nugget, to literary analysis, to personal anecdotes about her parenting // stroller experience. It is unexpectedly humanizing, it allowed me to feel like a peer to Morgan, rather than seeing her as a stodgy expert passing down her wisdom to you, dear reader. Morgan's vulnerability allowed me to connect with her and develop a kinship. It felt like we were on a journey together. I am an expecting father and can't wait to read Stroller again after I have some experience parenting.",

As informative as this content is, the best part of the book are the author\u2019s candid and realistic anecdotes of her experiences as a mother with a stroller.
