                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Versatile, Sturdy, Smooth",
                "reviewText": "This baby stroller is a very \"top of the line\" stoller. There are so many options that make this so versatile.First, the construction, the main structure is aluminum tubing with an oval design. The connections and adjustment parts are a type of molded plastic that feels very solid. The rear wheels are 9 inch diameter and the front swivel wheels are 6 inch diameter. Both sets of wheels are mounted on molded frames that incorporate springs to act as shock absorbers. The wheels roll very easily and the back wheel have a foot controlled lever that locks the wheels in place. The front swivel wheels also have a manual switch that allows you to lock the swivel so that the front wheels stay straight.Second, The stroller came in a box and had two main pieces, the main assembly and the basket. Also the wheels were seperate inside the basket. The complete unit weighs around 23 pounds when put together. You need to install the wheels. (they snap in place and would be removeable if needed) Then you need to open the floded basket and attach it to the stroller body. It was fairly easy to assemble.Third, the basket can be used as a bassinet or there are straps and belts to fold it into a stroller seat including safety harness to strap the infant into. These changes can be done in a few minutes and is easier if you remove the basket from the stroller frame.Forth, the basket or seat can be reversedso that the infant is facing you. The basket comes with a retractable hood that is zippered in and a lower body cover that is also zippered in when you use it on windy or colder days. The basket has a cushion that covers the safety belts when used as a bassinet. The basket has a removeable bar that can be used to lift the seat or basket off of the stroller frame with two release points so you can carry the basket into the house with you.Fifth, with two clicks, the unit folds almost in half and there is a bar that allows you to carry the folded unit. This is a very well thought out design with lots of great ideas to make using a stroller safer and easier while riding in comfort.",

The compatibility is next level with this stroller. It has so many different functions and capabilities. I love the large storage space underneath. It makes a great place to keep the diaper back when going to the park. The fabric is very easy to clean and has yet to stain after cleaning up multiple messes on it. The canopy comes in handy on sunny days to keep the sun out of his eyes and off his skin. I would recommend purchasing this stroller and I can\u2019t wait to use the other functions once he gets older.",

Best way to avoid having your baby in a car seat for hours at a time. This stroller is easy to set up and comfortable for baby. I love this for vacations or fun outings with the kids. My baby can sleep comfortably and I can see her perfectly. The price is a bit high. But it really is worth every penny. It's easy to clean and easy to store.",

The bassinet feature is great for those early months when the baby is sleeping all the time. You can just move this anywhere you need it, indoors and out, and have a safe place to sleep.",

It took up more space than I like, and it wont fit my toddler granddaughter very well. A great item for a new mom but I would like to see these grow with the child more over time.",

Did not use or try the bassinet portion.As with any baby product, we knew assembly would be challenging. Since this isn't the first stoller we've put together, we were able to figure it out after a couple tries. This stroller is lighter and easier to move around than our old one. It's a little smaller as well and fits better in our car.I believe this would make a great gift for new parents as well.",

It\u2019s very versatile and has three different ways that it can be used depending on the age of your child. it is a bit hard to put together, and the instructions could definitely be more clear, but once you get the hang of it, it is a great stroller. It does fold flat, and it can easily be folded to put in a car, which makes it great when you\u2019re on the go. This would be a great gift for new parents.",
