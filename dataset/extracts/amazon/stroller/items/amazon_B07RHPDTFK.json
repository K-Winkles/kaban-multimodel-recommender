                "reviewText": "This stroller is great if you need a stroller that can fold down to a compact size. It's actually small enough that you can throw this onto the flight as a carry on. Depending on the seat, it may be small enough to fit underneath. At least this way you don't have to gate check it and possibly get it damaged like my other strollers have.You have to remember that this stroller is minimalistic in terms for padding and storage. There's a storage space below that may hold your diaper bag but not a large one. No cup holders or any other storage for anything else. I use this stroller mainly for travel or short days out. Otherwise I use a wagon that we have that have plenty of storage. Without weight in the stroller and being so small, I would not advise hanging anything on the handles.The front two wheels have the options to either lock them to only face forward or move independently. The maneuverability of this stroller is fantastic and easy to move around. The handles do not adjust to turn for different ways to grab and push the stroller. You are able to adjust the height. I'm 5'9\" and it is comfortable when the handles all the way up. If you are over 6'2\", it can be a little unformattable if you have shorter arms.I've realized that opening the stroller requires you to \"snap\" it in place so the rear wheels are locked and will not fold on you. But folding it down only you requires you to push the buttons on the handles and push the whole stroller down to fold it closed. There's a latch that keeps everything locked and closed and a handle to help you carry it around. It's fairly lightweight enough to carry with one hand but will get heavy overtime. After you fold and unfold the stroller a couple times, it's real easy to get use to it. I have no issues with it.The stroller itself handles uneven and mild rocky surfaces pretty well. But remember if you're on cobblestone pathways, your child is going to feel every bit of that being how minimal the padding is. Otherwise the kid seems comfortable.All in all this is a great stroller for travel and being out and about. Obviously this is geared mainly for air travel and any places you need to fold the stroller. It is sturdy but will need more time to test the sturdiness of the folding mechanism.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a trip via airplane with my 2 year old, and I would by it again, it worked very well, for the most part.Pros:Folds easily - after about 3 tries, you'll be a pro, and it folds into a small footprintLight - well this is relative, but there's a model that is a bit heavier, but when I had this in the backpack along with food/water/diapers/wipes, etc., it got heavy to lug around, especially if you are walking long distances. Lighter the better!Fits easily into overhead storage or under the seat for airplanes - that way you can carry it on and use it once you land.Does exactly what it' s supposed to, maneuvers very easilyCons:If you are used to a full size stroller, this is very different, in fact it'll feel flimsy at first, but that's what you give up for portability.Sunshade - it works if it's high noon, otherwise it's fairly useless but folds away easily so it's not a nuisance.Storage - when using the stroller the bottom storage is very limited.Sits upright - you can't recline the chair, so it's not good for newborns, find something else.All in all it worked great, I walked miles with my 2 year old in this stroller without issue. It's not a full size, every day use stroller, but it's great for trips where you don't want to lug around a big stroller. Folding and unfolding become second nature after a few tries, easily got in and out of cabs with this thing in a backpack.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot express how impressed I am with this compact stroller! Its ability to fold up and fit perfectly in the overhead bin on an airplane has been an absolute game-changer for our travels. Despite its compact size, the quality is exceptional, rivaling that of a full-size stroller. From its sturdy frame to its smooth maneuverability, this stroller has exceeded all of my expectations. Whether we\u2019re navigating crowded airports or strolling through city streets, it handles like a dream. Plus, the convenience of being able to bring it on board without having to check it at the gate gives me so much peace of mind. If you\u2019re in the market for a travel-friendly stroller without compromising on quality, look no further. This stroller is a must-have for any parent on the go!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a lightweight stroller that doesn\u2019t take too much space, my baby is only 2yo but he\u2019s a super tall baby, 30+ lbs, I needed something with a heavy weight capacity so we can use it for a while. I have mixed feelings about this one\u2026 let\u2019s see:Pros:-It folds up tiny, like really you can easily put it in a back pack, so I guess that\u2019s a plus when traveling.-It has a long backrest, so my big boy seems to be comfortable in it.-Very lightweight.-Easy to push, even though I am only tested it in my house, but the wheels feel smooth (Will update after our NYC trip).-55lbs weight capacity, love it!!! Not many options out there offering that much. I tested with my 8yo who is around 50lbs now and it runs perfectly.Cons:-Doesn\u2019t feel sturdy at all, it almost feels like my baby is falling side when I turn right or left\u2026-The sun cover feels extremely cheap, it\u2019s made with a very thin clothe\u2026 It feels like it can be easily ripped off.-Not that easy to fold, you\u2019d need both hands and strong arms to secure it with the clamp. Same with unfolding, it\u2019s not that easy. I guess with practice it gets easier but you\u2019ll still need both hands.I\u2019d buy it again\u2026 but not for that price.Update: it did really great in the streets of New York. I was surprised!! Even my 9yo used it sometimes when he was tired of the long walks. I even recommended it to my sisters and she loves it as well.",

                "reviewText": "We travel alot in our compact suv (gmc terrain) Our Nuna Mixx stroller takes up too much space in the cargo. I seen this item posted on tiktok and I was sold. I purchased this stroller while Amazon had a sale! It fits perfectly anywhere and everywhere. I place it on the floor by the carseat behind the driver seat and fits nicely. We take the stroller everywhere. My son is 4 months when we purchased it, he loves it and is able to nap in it comfortably. The basket under the stroller is small, but fits his toys, portable change pad and bottle bag, blanket. It is a travel stroller, it's convenient. I have a itzy ritzy stroller caddy that fits awesome even when folded. If I focused on the basket under the stroller, I'd use my Nuna. But for space in the vehicle to travel with 2 adults, 1 child and 1 infant (and all of the babies items) this stroller is a life saver!! It really folds nicely that's smaller than a carry on suitcase! We look forward to bringing it on the plane in the future!",
