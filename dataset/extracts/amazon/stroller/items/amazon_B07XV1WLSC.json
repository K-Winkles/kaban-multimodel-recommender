                "reviewText": "I really love this stroller. To get the durability and quality that it gives, I\u2019m ok with how heavy it is. I like a bit of an arm challenge anyways. I imagine most people who are seriously considering getting this are athletic and like to feel strong. But it\u2019s only when moving it up and down stairs or into the car that you\u2019re having to feel strong. Though because of how big the tires are, it\u2019s possible to keep the stroller on its back wheels when going up and down stairs, which makes it easier. Pushing this stroller is a breeze whether you\u2019re running or walking. It glides so smoothly. We used my friend\u2019s plastic stroller for a trip and hated every second on the uneven sidewalks and going up and down curbs, even on the pavement, simply because we had experienced the amazing ride quality of this stroller. I ran in the snow yesterday and it was hard because of the snow, but the stroller worked great. And the tires make it high enough that the bag didn\u2019t drag in the snow. The tire size also makes curbs so easy to go over. I mostly chose this version of the Bob stroller to get the bin that closes and that\u2019s been awesome too. I haven\u2019t had to worry about anything falling out and I have plenty of storage to hold things for long walks. I do want to mention that folding it with my small sized hand isn\u2019t the easiest because of how wide the bar is, but it\u2019s easy for my husband. It\u2019s also not the smoothest with folding and unfolding because of the front tire catching on the bag or needing to reposition the front tire so that it lays flat, but it works good enough for me.",

                "reviewText": "If you want an easier way to fold, it\u2019s best to use both hands to do it! I simply use both of my thumbs to press the yellow button and then twist. My husband tried to teach me the one handed technique and I was only getting frustrated, but realized that my hands aren\u2019t as big as his. So using two hands was a lot easier for me. Other than that, the product is great! You will need some oil for the brakes because if it\u2019s raining, the brakes will squeak. I would recommend a large vehicle because it does take up some space regardless if you take the wheels off, but again easy to assemble. It is adaptable to different car seats if you get the adapter for it. I would walk with friends and it\u2019s so easy for me to walk in grass and different terrain compared to their Nuna strollers. Wish I would have gotten this before the Graco.",

                "reviewText": "It took me several months to make up my mind and purchase this Bob Gear Alterrain Pro.We needed a stroller for my daily walks, for our trips and cobble stones. We have Cybex Priam that I love dearly but it's definitely not a stroller I would take on a a hiking trip.This BOB Alterrain Pro is absolutely amazing.Originally, I wanted a Thule or City Jogger. Thule is a nice stroller, lighter but the seat is shallow and the kids tend to outgrow it faster. My brother got the Tule for his kid and I have to say, the push is not as smooth as with the BOB.I didn't get to try the City Jogger but I didn't like the fact, you couldn't positiong the handle bar.Yes, this BOB is on the heavier side but it's totally worth it. It folds easily and and stands on its own.It is for my 1yo daughter but my 4yo son who is 44\" tall fits in just fine as well. When he gets tired, he sits in the foot rest and I can push both kids at the same time :)We are super happy we picked this Alterrain Pro over Thule",

                "reviewText": "Love the look of this stroller, it\u2019s beautiful.However, there were no directions on how to open this baby up. When we first got it, I let it sit in our living room all folded up for at least a week before diving in to get it open so I could assemble the wheels.I also had the same screeching problem that apparently a lot of other buyers had. I live in aAlaska, so returning this thing seemed as daunting as the sound it was making. I was frustrated after spending $600 plus the attachments, to find out I couldn\u2019t even walk my newborn down the road in peace, the screeching didn\u2019t start until we were 1/2 a mile down the road, and it was an embarrassingly loud walk back home.After reading reviews, I felt hopeless, but determined. We tried oiling the breaks and the wheels, removed the wheel, tried riding the break which in the moment helped but not after, I literally have kicked the left tire where the screeching comes from, repeatedly try to ride the break, all seem to help momentarily. But most recently, I realized when I adjust the handle bar from higher to lower, the screeching comes back, when I adjust it back up, it stops. The break line rides up against the right side of the handle bar. The fact that the handle bar has so many adjustment options, is a feature I love, but with this screeching break issue, I can live with keeping the bar at only the 2 higher levels.If the screeching wasn\u2019t a common issue, and it could be easier for me to exchange or return, I would give it 5/5 stars.",
