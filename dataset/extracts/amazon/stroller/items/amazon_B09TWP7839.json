Multiple seating configurations, all with parent- and outward-facing positions, create 8 different ways to stroll.

The stroller seat converts to a carriage, giving infants a safe and comfortable place to stretch out during a stroll. The car seat and stroller seat can be clicked into the stroller frame separately or together so that all pieces travel together, for when you need all your options. As baby gets older, the stroller seat can accommodate kids up to 50 lbs. and has a step-up bar that lets them climb into the seat on their own. Additional features that parents will love include an extra-large storage basket and canopy, tray with two parent cup holders, child snack tray with rubber-grip cup holder, and compact one-hand fold.",

                "reviewText": "This little stroller is very nice. I bought it when one of my daughters had her sixth child. The very first thing that she said to me was, \"Where was this stroller when I had my other children\"?My daughter loves how versatile it is. She says it is easy to fold and adjust \"With One Hand\".When I put it all together, I was very impressed how many options are not only available, but they all come with the product. No extra's that you need to buy. Okay, wait. Once extra car mount for the seat is extremely helpful, so that it can be used in two different vehicles. Other than that, EVERYTHING is included and very nice quality. It's light and sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "*Will update review after using for a while*First impressions, I\u2019m very happy with this! Putting together was surprisingly easy as well. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but it was fairly easy to assemble. I\u2019m the photos, the flash is on, so you see the reflective stripe at the bottom basket & the handle cushion portions appear grey, but everything is black in person. The quality is nice too. I do however wish that the same material used for the canopies, or at least closely similar to it, was also used for the sides of the bassinet part. The material it is now is wrinkly (hopefully it will smooth out over time), and reminds me of umbrella material. The wheels move very smoothly and glide effortlessly. The back wheel break located across the bottom is very nicely placed and easy to push down and up. I LOVE how it looks with just the carseat attached, and it makes it super easy for transporting. The carseat base also fits perfectly at the bottom basket of the stroller, which is very spacious. I bought the leather carrier attachments from SHEIN for under $3, and they are a great accessory to add on. There were a few small scuffs, but nothing to be in an uproar about. As mentioned at the start, I will update as soon as I start to use. Our due date isn\u2019t until 10/14, so I will update the review after time has passed.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fresh out of the box review. Will add more after our 2 week trip with it. So far, it is far more rugged than I expected. The pictures on here make it appear cheap and flimsy, plus the fact that it is significantly cheaper than the other similar items made me more skeptical. But I opened the box and put it together in 5 minutes with no tools or instructions. The frame of stroller and bassinet are far more stout and sturdy than the pictures on Amazon lead me to believe. The fabric parts seem just as thick and durable as my other brand strollers (Chicco, Evenflo double stroller, and Graco) if not more so than some. I should probably mention this for my third kid. I like that the car seat can click into the bassinet in seat mode so you don't have to disassemble if you don't want to.Surprise likes: single crossbar for one step to lock the back wheels. FYI new parents that is a small convenience you will love if you have to lock the wheels on anykind if incline. The wheels also have some kind of nice foam instead of plastic or tires.The car seat is a little mediocre but nothing wrong with it. All in all I highly recommend so far.Update: Took it on a cross country flight with a layover to NY and it worked awesome! It was a real life saver on that trip for the 2.5 weeks we were there. It also withstood getting a beating from the luggage handlers on one flight. Walked it through grassy parks, the Bronx Zoo, Times square, Lake George. My baby took naps in it with and without the extra mattress I bought. It also worked great as a cart for all our carry-on bags and bringing stuff in and out of the hotels. My 4.5 year also used it a couple times. Highly recommend.",
