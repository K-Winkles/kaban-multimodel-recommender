I have 3 toddlers and this is so spacious for them to fit into comfortably, tons of leg space and they love to cruise in it. The different options with the seats layout is such a great feature too. I love how much storage it has, you can fit so much plus it comes with a very large insulated cooler and a removable caddy that holds snacks and drinks for the kiddos in the stroller. There\u2019s also drink holders for the adults and they are large enough to hold my 44 oz thermal cup. Its easy to push and rides so smooth even with a full cart. Love the canopy to protect the kids from the sun but it\u2019s also removable to enjoy on cooler days. Folds down easily in seconds to store in the car and can easily be opened as well. Great quality, has some weight to it but not so heavy that it\u2019s hard to carry. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "First let me say, you have to take reviews with a grain of salt and really evaluate your needs on and individual/family basis. I knew I needed something that was large and could hold multiple children. My daughters are not small children. They have long legs and arms. Although I only have two, we needed room. This was PERFECT! They have so much wiggle room. Not only that, the design is excellent. It is easy to maneuver and it folds up compact. I have no complaints about anything. I love the canopy \u2014shade from the sun is a MUST. And I think the little cup holders and tray area nice touch for parents. My only wish if I could change anything would have been for a stop lock on both ends of the wagon so that could lock from either side but even that is cosmetic. Overall this is excellently made and worth the investment. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This wagon is awesome. Has great features including the canopy with uv protectors. It was very easy to put together. Comes with multiple cup holders and a cooler. I love that you can arrange the seats in many different ways.This wagon is very large and very heavy. It takes up half the trunk space in my SUV. It is also hard to lift on my own. All the accessories including the seats must be taken off before it can be folded up.",

                "reviewText": "It is extremely heavy but it has many cool features and lots of storage. I plan on using it at an art and wine festival but im not sure how well it will menuer with crowds, i will update. I have a 6 year (46 inches tall) old 4 year (42 inches tall) old and a 3 month old (23 inches tall) ... It can fit all 3 of my kids, head room w\\canopy and butt room is fine but is tight on leg room. I tried having them face outward but if facing forward their feet hit the wheels which makes maneuvering hard and could possibly hurt them, i havent tried backwards, when facing in they have to sit next to each other or kiddy corner and when accross from each other their legs have to go between the others. If i have them both on the same side on the front going over a lip like up a driveway curb or the place where the grass meets the cement and there's a slight difference in height it seems like the front wheels might break off they aren't very sturdy for that and I actually had to walk around to the front and lift up the front to get it over the curb maybe next time I'll try going backwards. I've only tried it going around my block which is about a 40 minute walk and it's very easy to push around cant make sharp turns but it maneuvers well enough for how heavy it is although you can't feel the heaviness very much when pushing mostly just when turningor lifting in and out of the car and having an SUV it's a high lift for me of course w\\ the kids + treats + drinks + clothes +diapers and wipes it does get heavy, the kids like to ride in it the canopy and shades are convenient. There is a lot of storage. It's got a good durable quality for the most part besides those front wheels. However I don't think I would buy it again. I think it would be more suitable for smaller kids. It's also pretty bulky but I kind of expected that because it holds four kids and just my two seated strollers were quite bulky too but had very little storage. I took the star for the bulky heaviness and the leg issues (them hitting the wheels when forward facing and lack of room when facing inward) also the snack tray is great but difficult with the leg room cant use it if my oldest is in the wagon. The buckles are great and easy to use the cooler and cup holders a great too. If it wasnt for the heaviness and maybe if i had smaller kids Id love it.",

We did see them at Legoland and we used it at Knott's Berry Farm.",

                "reviewText": "I was disappointed that one of the seat attachments was broken upon getting it. I reached out to the company and left a message hopefully they will call me back.I absolutely love this cart. I have 3 kiddos 6yrs old, 4 yrs old and 17 months old and it fits them all so comfortably. I love all the compartments and smoothness of the ride for them. Besides getting a part broken upon arrival I am very happy with the cart and highly recommend it. We had another wagon cart before that I loved but the kids outgrew that when we had baby #3 and they can all fit in this cart way better.",
