With being a winter baby I really wanted a bassinet option and the ability to change out pieces as needed.Pros: I love this stroller so far! It is so easy to change out seats and drives like a dream. Additionally the bassinet is serving as our primary one now because our baby loves it so much! The quality in the bassinet alone is amazing\u2014my son peed all over it and the pee didn\u2019t even penetrate the cover!Only one con: my 4 year old is a tiny but tall for the toddler seat despite being 37 lbs but he still finds it super comfortable and is really anlmost out of stroller riding anyway.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love our UppaBaby stroller and bassinet! I use it pretty much everyday on walks on trails or the street. It glides like butter, and others who push it compliment its ease. I have taken it through grass a few times and it\u2019s really easy to push. It has shock-absorbing, all-wheel suspension which is one quality we were looking for when choosing a stroller. It was one of the qualities I asked people they wished they had in their stroller or looked for when they chose a stroller.The stroller is really easy to fold up and open back up. About two weeks post C-section it was easy enough for me to open, close, and lift into my car. I appreciate that the bassinet is one button to remove from the attachment pieces on the stroller.My little one loves laying in the bassinet while we go on walks. The material is breathable and machine washable. I haven\u2019t washed it yet but it\u2019s easy to remove. I appreciate that it comes with the bug net and an SPF 50 sunshade. It\u2019s easy to pull down and push back up.I like that you can add an additional bassinet, toddler seat, or a skateboard on the back. We just have the one kiddo right now, but we plan to buy an attachment piece when we need it.Although it\u2019s a little on the pricey side, it\u2019s great quality and I feel like it\u2019ll last us awhile. I would recommend it to anyone looking.",

The handlebar is amazing: Extendable, sturdy, never gets stuck and it\u2019s covered with waterproof leather. The stroller folds up easily with one click. The bottom basket is huge and holds up to 30 lbs. The bassinet is handy and we will be using the bassinet with the bassinet stand as baby's nighttime sleep spot for a while. We love how it will grow with our family.",

Y esto totalmente ajeno al proveedor.Si recomiendo la compra.",
