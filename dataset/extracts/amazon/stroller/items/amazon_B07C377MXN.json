                "reviewText": "These work great with the Joovy Qool stroller to add a second seat, carseat adapter, or bassinet. Note that the adapters put the seat you're attaching OUT rather than UP like a lot of tandem strollers. This could be a pro or a con for you. The pro would be that having the seat farther OUT leaves more room for the top rider (the seats are farther apart). But with it going OUT, it makes the stroller footprint as a whole much longer and harder to manipulate.PROS:- easy to install and uninstall- stroller CAN fold with the adapters on; unfortunately the stroller cannot fold with the second seat on, but you can remove the second seat and at least leave the adapters on to fold it to save one more step when you reassembleCONS:- the stroller frame itself has these removable end caps in the \"holes\" where the adapters go. To install these second seat adapters, you must remove the end caps and store them somewhere. There is no storage place for them on the stroller itself. I just know these end caps are going to get lost. I wish that was thought through a little better, with either covers that stay on and slide out of the way (like other tandem strollers in this class) or having some type of zipper pouch built into the basket to store them in to keep them with the strollerThe Joovy Qool stroller itself is a really great stroller.

                "reviewText": "These are great for converting the Joovy Qool stroller into a double or even triple if you\u2019re using the extra front bench. I use my stroller frequently with three small children, I usually keep the front bench on and use their infant seat in the main position (this works well for if I only have two kids with me or if I have one of them walking). When I need to have seating for all three kids I quickly snap on these two bars and add a third seat. They snap in very easily so you can use it with or without the seat as needed. I love that the stroller is versatile like that with multiple kids and you can basically have a stroller to fit any type of trip you\u2019re taking on demand rather than having three or four different strollers you can create the stroller you need on demand. The nice thing about these bars is it doesn\u2019t extend the profile of the stroller too much but what I like even more is that they easily come off and you can have a slimmer stroller when you don\u2019t need them.I almost forgot I also like to use these bars to attach the infant seat with nothing in the main position so my preschooler can use the bench seat and have plenty of headspace when I\u2019m only traveling with the baby and the preschooler and it works great. I can even add my shopping bag to the main position and go on a nice mall trip!",
