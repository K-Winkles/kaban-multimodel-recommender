I bought this to go along with the Pivot Xpand so that my 4 year old could stand and ride along with my two year old and my soon-to-be infant. It works out well when the stroller is in a single configuration, but once it becomes a double stroller, it is very uncomfortable for my oldest son. If I have the infant seat in the top position, he basically has to squat to use the board at all. Some configurations give him more room, but they\u2019re not the most convenient for the other two\u2026In addition, this thing rattles like crazy. I\u2019ve only taken it out in a single configuration since baby 3 isn\u2019t here yet. It is very noisy and rattles a lot, which seems to be exclusive to the board (when the board is folded up, I get a very smooth ride). This doesn\u2019t change whether my son is on the board or not\u2014it is constantly noisy.I also had a hard time figuring out how to install the storage strap. The instructions were confusing, and I could not find any instructional videos, so I am unsure if I installed correctly or not.All in all, I\u2019m glad I bought it, because I don\u2019t know what else I would do with three small kids, I just wish it would have been designed better to make it a triple stroller\u2026 not just a board for the single configuration.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted this to work so badly but it is not compatible with the Evenflo Pivot stroller. Must be for Pivot Xpand only. Which is crazy because they are set up the exact same so they should have made this work for both Pivot strollers. Will be returning and will continue my search for something for my toddler to ride on without having to buy another stroller.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this item for my daughter to use with her Evenflo stroller. She flew home with 4 children and had a connection in a busy airport. I asked her how it worked out traveling by airplane and making connections.She said ; good quality, survived gate checking & baggage handlers, easy to attach & remove, although was unnecessary as it has a strap to keep in closed position. Her 5 & 7 year olds were able to ride on the board through the airports. It was a little harder to push with their weight but that is to be expected. Her comment was \"Best attachment ever\". I personally, thought is was reasonably priced for a stroller attachment.",
