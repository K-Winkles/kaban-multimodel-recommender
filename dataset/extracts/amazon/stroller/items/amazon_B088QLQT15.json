The Disney Baby teeny ultra compact stroller is lightweight, delightfully small and perfect for travel - especially to Disney parks.Traveling small is hugethe compact size of the teeny makes it easy to maneuver through a crowd or narrow aisles.Lots of stuff in the basket the teeny may be, well. Teeny, but it doesn't skimp on storage space. You can fit a diaper bag and more into this basket!even more stuff in the pocket what about easy access to your phone and wallet? We've thought of that, too! The covered pocket near the handlebar lets you keep small personal items handy but out of view.Easy fold and carry the lightweight teeny folds and carries with one hand, and without the help of professional MOVERS! At 15 pounds, it rivals the weight of your overstuffed handbag.Stands still because your kids won't after an easy one-handed fold, the teeny stands by itself, so you can focus on what really matters - your child's safety.Cup-zilla cup holder this huge cup holder easily holds your drink, so you can take it on the go. You can choose to attach the cup holder on the right or left side of the stroller.Made in the gigantic shade The extra-large canopy, complete with your favorite Disney ears, lets your child sit comfortably in the shade on sunny days, with a flip-out visor to protect from oncoming glare.Too cool for (pre-) school the mesh-lined peek-a-boo window gives you an easy view during the stroll and provides your child with better airflow as they enjoy the ride.Flip flops welcome sure, sneaks are comfy, but sometimes you want something comfy and stylish. The flip-flop friendly brakes make it simple to put the stroller into park.",

I\u2019m sure after breaking it in a bit it should fold easily. On the box it did say that it\u2019s also approved by Disney (I\u2019m guessing they have size restrictions for the parks) so I thought that was neat. The stroller does allow you to sit up right or lay all the way down, and you can adjust the leg rest. It has a secret pocket in the back and a single cup holder. The cup holder does stick out awkwardly so I get nervous I\u2019ll clip a corner too fast and break it off. Other than that absolutely love this stroller.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: We did a test run at the aquarium recently. LOVE the stroller. It was so easy to maneuver through crowds and steer one handed. I love that the break is so easy to put on and off. It folded up easily and didn't take up much space in the trunk. After unfolding it a few times, I've figured out how to more easily release the latch. Still can't do it one-handed, but maybe with more practice... I'm so happy we went with this one for our travel stroller. And added bonus... my son actually finished up a nap in the stroller which I was really worried about. He doesn't transfer well when he's sleeping and once he wakes up, he rarely goes back to sleep even if he's only been out for 10 mins. He fell asleep in my arms during a show, but my husband was able to lay the seat back on the stroller and I was able to lay him in there somewhat seamlessly. Then we just very carefully strapped him in. Pro tip: If you know nap time is coming, go ahead and lay back the seat and detach all parts of the harness and stretch them out where they won't get stuck under the baby and cause you to dig for straps. I'm so excited about this stoller. Can't wait to do some more test runs before our big Disney trip! I also decked it out with some lights and accessories and finally got to take some pics, so enjoy! :)ORIGINAL REVIEW:I ordered this stroller for our upcoming Disney trip because our \"everyday\" stroller is huge when folded up and not easy to lug around on a bus. Naturally I had to get a Mickey stroller. I was a little hesitant because I couldn't find many reviews on this particular stroller in comparison to some of the others I was considering, but I did a bunch of research and found that this is the exact same stroller as the Safety 1st Teeny Ultra Compact Stroller (just Disney-fied), so if you're like me and need to read a ton of reviews, search for that and see the reviews there.We haven't used it in the park yet, but I can already tell it's going to be really easy to maneuver one-handed when needed and it is very light when folded. Overall I really like it and can't wait to use it. The few problems I have right off the bat are:1 - when it's just empty, the stroller has a slight off-balance problem where one of the front wheels doesn't touch the ground and it just sort of teeters from side to side2 - because of the compact fold, there's a part near where kiddo's head would be when seated that folds and there's a big crease there and it looks a little deformed when fully open. Not a huge deal, but could be a weak spot in the longevity of the stroller.3 - the latch that keeps it closed when folded up is just about impossible to undo with one hand, so if you've got a kid in your hand it could get tricky.Overall, I'm pretty happy with it and can't wait to use it at Disney.",
