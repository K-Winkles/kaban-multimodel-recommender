Front wheel does a full 360 turn and has a lock option for when jogging if need be.The seat is very padded and comfortable. I use this with my 10 month old (she\u2019s strong enough. Plz make an informed decision before jogging) \u2014 I\u2019m a slow jogger and she just smiles away.The 5 point harness is nice and sturdy. I wish I could tighten the straps just a tad more but again, I\u2019m using this with a 10 month old. It\u2019ll be fine once she\u2019s bigger. Lots of room to grow.The bottom basket is a decent size, it carried about 5 bags of groceries for me.Overall 5/5. Would recommend & would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "We are not actually joggers, but we walk daily in areas with extra rough roads and sidewalks. This grade of jogger did just what we needed to give our little guy a smoother ride than he had in our other small-wheeled stroller, without breaking the bank. Its stability and ease of walking on varied terrain helps make it possible for one person to walk the big dog and push the baby solo whether we need to roll across a broken sidewalk, over some asphalt, or into the grass at the park.The features and construction are more bare bones than the big brands, but the stroller is functional for our needs. Example: It has manual foot locks, but no handle brakes to slow down while running. So if I were training for a marathon or planned to use the stroller for years through multiple babies, I\u2019d invest in one of the fancier brands. Example 2: It also takes up lots of room in the vehicle and isn\u2019t the easiest to fold up/down and load into the car. So I would not use it for a state-hopping travel stroller or if I lived in a tiny house and needed something compact.But for a reliably smoother ride and daily comfort for the little guy, this works great for us!",

                "reviewText": "So far this stroller has been unboxed, assembled, tires re-inflated and wheeled around empty, to see how it feels. We are on our 6th and last baby and have used a Bob revolution since baby #2. We thought we were done having kids and gave our revolution away, so when we were faced with needing a stroller one more time, we knew we wanted a jogger, and looked into new and used Bob strollers. After many hours of research, we decided to give this stroller a try, instead. A big part of that decision was the price tag, for only one last baby, the Bob seemed extravagant. Additionally, while the Bob was cutting edge 15 years ago, they have not changed much while other stroller companies have been catching up! So far, we are pleased with this purchase! It rides smoothly, the seat adjustment is quick and easy, better than our last Bob. The wrist strap has Velcro so it can be pinned out of the way when not in use. Folding and unfolding are quick and easy, and while it doesn\u2019t fold down like an umbrella stroller, it isn\u2019t bigger than expected and the rear tires remove easily if needed. The storage basket is larger and more easily accessed than our Bob Revolution, which I love! For the Bob, we had to purchase a child snack tray and a car seat adaptor bar separately, at additional cost. This stroller comes with the child tray, and since I have purchased a Baby Trend car seat, it will fit on this stroller like they were made for each other. (Because, they were!) there is also a parent tray, with two roomy cup holders and a phone tray, another feature that had to be purchased separately for the Bob. Altogether, I am very pleased with the value of this purchase, and the quality compared to a 2015 Bob Revolution, which was the last model we owned. A final note, black and gray were both sold out when I ordered, so I went with the pink/gray, with some trepidation. The pink is actually more of a dusty rose than a bright pink, and the stroller is still mostly dark gray. I\u2019m quite pleased with the color combination. I was concerned that the pink would be too flashy and bright, but it is a nice accent color.",

                "reviewText": "I usually prefer high-end strollers, because I hate cheap looking strollers. After purchasing a more high end jogging stroller, and realizing that it was too big for me. I returned it and found this one. This is a very good sporty looking stroller, it doesn't look cheap at all. I have used it three times in the track so far and it rolls very smoothly in different terrains, the canopy is large enough to cover most part of the baby. And there are a lot of netting, which makes it very breezy for the baby. It folds and unfolds very easily, although a little bulky when folded. I also like the cupholder feature for parents which has a phone holder in the middle. The cupholder for the baby holds a regular size iPad, as well as cups and snacks for the baby. I did only give it four stars because of a couple of features that I am not so in love with. Number 1 I am not too thrilled about having to step on both rear tires to lock them and number 2 the window to be able to see the baby from the top is a little too small and far. I'm 5 feet and I can't peek at my baby while walking. I have to look through the side to see what he is doing. Not a dealbreaker, so I'm keeping the stroller.",
