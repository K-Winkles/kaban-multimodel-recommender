                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Honestly, I love this cat fan. I am a very warm person, and can\u2019t stand the heat. I\u2019m also a crazy cat lady. If it\u2019s cat shaped or a cat design, I must own it. So I was looking for a little fan to put by my bed at night, and I came across this! I was iffy on buying due to some of the reviews, but I ended up saying \u201ceh if it don\u2019t work, it\u2019s still cute!\u201d Well, to my luck, it works, and it works way more efficiently than I expected. It\u2019s not what I would consider \u201cquiet\u201d but it\u2019s not loud either. It would be cool if it could oscillate, but being able to angle this how ever is well worth the trade. Upon receiving this fan, I did turn it on and test all features, they all worked. I did let the fan run until it died before charging, it lived for almost 4 hours, and the charge took roughly 5 hours. It then ran for 8-9 hours on the second setting. Long hold the button for lights on, long hold to turn them off. Fan does not have to be running for the LED lights to be turned on. The 4th setting is like a constant up and down ramp setting, I\u2019m not much of a fan for that one. But the first setting is perfect for me at night. I took this fellow to the board walk for 4th of July fire works and it securely stayed in place on the rails where I sat! On the 3rd setting, outside , it was perfect! I\u2019m disappointed I didn\u2019t buy the pink one as well! I highly recommend for a cat lover, a kid, or someone who needs a convenient little fan that can attach to pretty much anything !! 10 out of 10! Worth the price worth the buy!",

So I thought this portable fan that looks like a kitty would be perfect for her because she loves cats too haha anyway I like how strong the fan is considering its size and it's pretty quiet too and the flexible legs can hold on to pretty much anything. I will definitely buy another one for me when i play games at home but I just wish it comes in different color",
