This stroller has been evaluated by two adults, therefore, and has not yet met the destructive force that is the average toddler.We had some LOLs trying to get it to fold and unfold, but once you figure it out, it's no problem. Assembly is pretty minimal. This also comes with a snack tray, carry case and rain cover, which was a selling point especially for us because we want the one-stop shop kind of situation. I don't think it's as nice as the ones folks are buying these days that cost as much as a spa weekend, but for the money, it appears to be reasonably solid. The wheels are pretty big compared to some, which to my eyeballs and hands feels like it's more stable on a variety of surfaces.",
