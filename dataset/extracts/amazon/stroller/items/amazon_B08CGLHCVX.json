                "reviewText": "First and foremost the stroller says 6m but if you were curious how it would do for a strong 4m read on! We wanted a compact stroller for in stores and travel. My sister has a jeep umbrella stroller and I knew they liked theirs. I was excited when I saw they have a reclining option because my baby is 4 months old. The product clearly said 6 months but I felt comfortable having our baby try it based his size and head control. He was so cozy and happy. Wouldn\u2019t want to go younger or smaller as they would slip/scrunch down. We were outside in winter weather so fair amount of layers and I was impressed how well the harness can be adjusted and kept them secure in slippery fabric. Definitely not a lay flat stroller but the slight recline is why we could start using it early. Very impressed by the steering and storage. We have a very Thule jogging stroller and while it definitely won\u2019t replace - I told my husband \u201cif someone was really tight on money and size - I would just get this because it\u2019s so versatile!\u201d Husband said now that we have a Jeep we need to get a rubber ducky for it.Goes without saying - instructions say 6month old so be safe and do short tests to see if it\u2019s safe for your infant.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with my purchase. I have had the 3D Lite umbrella stroller, and for me personally, the Jeep Powerglyde is much better. My daughter has also enjoyed riding comfortably in this stroller. It was easy to assemble. I only had to attach the wheels. The basket is large and easy to access. The handles are also taller than the handles of other umbrella strollers I\u2019ve used which is also a huge plus for me. It rolls smoothly and the canopy is a nice size. I live in Florida and I wear sandals a lot, so another thing that I personally like about this stroller is that the breaks are easy to flip without hurting my feet (sounds weird, but if you know, you know lol). It collapses easily, however IF there were one thing I\u2019d change about this stroller it would be to add a better latch when closed. However that hasn\u2019t bothered me that much. Overall I Love this stroller. I have used several different umbrella stroller (mom of 3) and this is by far my favorite. I have recommend this stroller to family and friends.Side note: I added a universal stroller organizer to mine and it has made it even better!",
