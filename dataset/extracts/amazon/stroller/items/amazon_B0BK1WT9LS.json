I hate how other umbrella strollers have that plastic-like material. This stroller seems to have high quality material. It also has a lot bigger sun shades than other umbrella strollers\u2026 so far down that it comes to about my babies\u2019 forehead, yay!. The seats can lay back individually so one baby can sleep and the other can stay sitting up. It folds and unfolds very easily. It is pretty compact when folded. I love the color, very aesthetically pleasing. It was fairly easy to put together. I love the big pockets and attachment that comes with it. My only wish is that it had a lower big compartment to store my diaper bag, and I wish it had a cup holder but the long attachment has dividers so it can hold a drink well. Overall though, I love it!!!",

We've been loving the practicality and lightweight design of this double stroller. Folds down super easy, quick, and compact so we can even fit it into a sedan trunk!We have the grey/white color and I absolutely love how clean and aesthetic it looks. Nice handles for the adult and bars for children. Undercarriage space is decent and can definitely accommodate a medium or large diaper bag. Wish the seats reclined more so it was easier for the babies to nap on the-go.",

I bought this one to replace my bulky double stroller for my 1 year old twins that was taking up so much trunk space. I\u2019m only giving it 2 stars because it doesn\u2019t stay latched when folded down and when you remove it from the trunk it just comes out unfolded. The sun visor that\u2019s supposed to hook onto the frame of the stroller in the back doesn\u2019t stay hooked. It still stays up to block the sun but is very annoying because it comes off the hook thing so easily. I\u2019ve made a video That explains all this a little bit better. I do however love all of the storage on this stroller, it\u2019s awesome! It is also very easy to wipe clean! I do also wish that the handle was a full bar, it is quite difficult to steer it with one hand it\u2019s even a little hard to steer with both hands. My bulky Graco double stroller is easier to maneuver. I wouldn\u2019t buy this stroller again, but we\u2019re keeping it because the storage is good and it\u2019s compact.",

I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m using all my strength just to push 2 little ones around. It\u2019s easy to navigate through doorways, too. I also like the shade cover for each seat\u2014 it extends far and no complaints here! Also, I love the aesthetic- I have the \u2018grey stripes\u2019 color which is so cute for spring/summer coming. It folds nicely and it\u2019s perfect for a neighborhood walk!",
