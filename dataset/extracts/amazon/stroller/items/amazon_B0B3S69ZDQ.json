                "reviewText": "I'm not really one to write product reviews but I am so psyched about this stroller. We have an 18 month old and one on the way. After the Mockingbird recall I didn't feel comfortable continuing to use our stroller even with the replacement part, so I went on the hunt for a new double stroller, thinking I'd try a side by side instead. I was planning to purchase one at a WAY higher price point but kept coming back to this one because..well...$200 is unbeatable and worth a try before buying an expensive one. It had very few reviews and I've never heard of this one being recommended so I didn't have high expectations. I literally went on a three hour long tangent with excitement after putting this together. It glides and maneuvers like a DREAM compared to our Mockingbird, I love being able to recline or lift the foot rest of each seat separately, the basket below is huge, it comes with 2 convenient storage attachments at the handle bar for parents, huge sun shades that extend far down, it FITS THROUGH TIGHT DOORWAYS!!, and the leather accents are attractive. Only negative worth mentioning is it is a bit of a struggle to lift the weight of it into my trunk by myself.I'm just psyched. I feel like I know the best secret no one else has caught onto.",

                "reviewText": "When the stroller arrived I took it out of the box and started assembling it. All I had to do is pull it outwards and it pushes right out of it's fold into a stroller. You just pop the wheels right into place and they lock in. I loved how easy the wheels go in and lock. It really makes life easier when you need to travel and maybe take it apart for a trip. The stroller has such a beautiful modern look! My 2.5 year old and 1 year old are loving the stroller. The harness is really good quality and keeps them in their seats.",

                "reviewText": "There are so many pros and cons to this stroller. Summed up, it is a gorgeous stroller, drives smooth, and feels sturdy. Some pros: The leatherette details on the handle bar and child bar makes the stroller look lux and the black is very sleek. The stroller glides and drives like a dream! It is so smooth, and the turn radius is very good. The price is really good for what you get. The canopies are good, but don\u2019t cover all the way like other double strollers do. The peekaboo in the canopies are a plastic instead of a mesh. The leg rests are a great size and can fit a taller child well. The stroller also feels very sturdy and durable. However, the drawbacks were as follows: although it folds flat (which is good), it was to much of a hassle to fold and has some weight to it (thinking of ability while out in a parking lot). It does not stand up on its own from folding, but it can \u201cstand\u201d on its side. The stroller took up quite a bit of space in our 2022 Honda CR-V trunk (although when standing on its side, it saved some space). There is no step ledge for a child to step up on to get into the stroller. Not a deal breaker, but something I noticed. The seats had a good recline, but the latches to move the seat up or down had to be fidgeted a bit to work. It is also rated for 35 lbs in each seat. Other double strollers have a higher weight capacity.Overall, it is a great pick with some drawbacks. Ultimately we returned it because it didn\u2019t meet our personal needs of what we wanted, but if we had different needs/wants in our stroller, this would be the one!",

Its easy to pack up and great to maneuver. The best part of the stroller is the way it reclines for my babies feet so they arent dangling andddddd theres a peep window for when the shade is all the way down. Loving this stroller so far and my daughters absolutely light upp when i place them inside it.",

                "reviewText": "i wanted to test this stroller before writing a review, and I am very glad i did. I really put it to test, first at a pumpkin patch (gravel, grass) and then a couple times at Disneyland and let me tell ya\u2026 it did not disappoint! Specially at Disney where; if you have been, then you know they make you fold the stroller before you get on the tram, before we got this stroller we had the uppa baby (set up for both kids) and you pretty much have to put it apart to fold it\u2026 that sucked, but this one\u2026 easiest double stroller to fold! One click and bam! When you have 2 kiddos anxious to get to Disney you gotta move quick so this is now our everyday stroller. So I would totally recommend it! It has pockets behind each chair to put your personal items and storage at bottom is pretty spacious too.",

Reached out to their customer service team to fix or replace and they have basically got me chasing them for 6 months now. They promised to replace ny my stroller and ask that I make holes in mine as proof of destruction and its been weeks with no reply from them. I now have a broken stroller with holes in it and no reply from them in 2 weeks.Most dysfunctional customer service systems and company.",
