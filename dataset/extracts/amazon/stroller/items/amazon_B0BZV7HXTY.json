I can't fold it together like in the picture.The Seller/Company has to upload a video on how to do that. They don't when have it on Youtube either I checked.Just one video review, and she folded the stroll like I did.I will reach out to the company to see if they can put me through how to fold it.I will update you when they do.Update***** Before I reached out they saw my review and uploaded a video.Nothing is best for you than a seller actually doing what is best for the buyers.The seller listened and a video has uploaded on how to fold it in the car.I really appreciate that, Thumbs up!!!",

                "reviewText": "The directions that came with the stroller are for a stroller that has a push button easy fold option on the handle. As you can see in the photo, this is not the correct stroller instructions as there is no button on the handle. I cannot figure out how to fold this up to transport. It makes no sense how it doesn\u2019t easilyFold so it\u2019s losing a lot of stars due to this. Looks nice, but practicality wise it\u2019s too complicated.",
