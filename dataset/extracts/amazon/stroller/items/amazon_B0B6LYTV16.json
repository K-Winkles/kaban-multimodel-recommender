I wanted something better than the cheaper umbrella strollers I see some of my friends have. This is perfect. It\u2019s easy to fold. Light weight. Fits in my compact cars trunk.

                "reviewText": "This is a good stroller for the price. We needed something that was lightweight and could fold up small, but wanted something more sturdy than a traditional umbrella stroller. This is exactly that. No extra fluff. The sun visor is a waste and provides absolutely no shade. We took it off because it just made it bulkier when folded and didn\u2019t serve a purpose. The stroller is very difficult to close, but does fold up nicely, just like an umbrella stroller. I keep this in my car for times when I didn\u2019t think to pack the big stroller. It is perfect for shopping because it is small and maneuverable compared to my full size stroller. My daughter is about 33 pounds and 37 inches tall. She fits fine, but probably won\u2019t be able to use it much longer. She does look a little snug in it. My biggest complaint is the clip to hold it closed when folded did not work. It was on there and intact, but the opening was so small, it would not clamp on the bar like it was supposed to.",

And this is the perfect one for me and my baby. I love that it has cup holders and is washable, I love that I can easily recline his seat back for when he sleeps, and it fits in the car without taking so much space (which is what my mans loved as well).",

                "reviewText": "I love that this stroller was so lightweight and compact. I was also impressed with how smooth the ride was for such a small stroller. Closing it was not the best design but the major flaw is the basket underneath. The basket broke the first time on both sides and we exchanged it for a new one. The new one broke within a couple days on one side. We opted to just return it and get a different brand. If we didn\u2019t use the basket underneath for storage I would have kept it, but our little guy stills needs too much stuff when we go out to be without it.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE!! The push pin was just pushed up inside of the frame so it couldnt be seen. Finagled it out and now the stroller is perfect! Babytrend customer service helped by pointing this out.I purchased a \"like new\" one that was $12 cheaper than new and it arrived with the back stroller legs sticking out of a hole in the box. One of the metal push pins that holds the back wheel on is missing. Not sure if this happened in transit to me or if it was overlooked when it was previously returned and shipped out to me defective. I contacted babytrend using the link Amazon provided and haven't heard anything back in a week. Seems like a nice enough umbrella stroller for the price point. I like the zippered parent pouch and that the sun shade can be moved higher for an older child. We've been trying it around the house (carefully so the back wheel doesn't pop off) with my 30 lb 2 year old my 4 year old (can't remember his weight but he's tall). The front wheels sometimes just slide sideways but hoping that's just because it's not getting traction on the vinyl flooring. I would stay away from the previously returned ones if you're considering it but new would be a good value.",

The only thing I don\u2019t like is that it\u2019s not very compact and a bit of a task getting it in & out of the car. Just because you need to break it down but I\u2019ve gotten used to it and it\u2019s no big deal! It is a bit wide and doesn\u2019t always fit in some places I need to go but it still beats using an umbrella stroller! Also, the storage space underneath is perfect!!",
