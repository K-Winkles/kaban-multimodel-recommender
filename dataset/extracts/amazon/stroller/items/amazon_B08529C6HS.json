It\u2019s easier to push/pull than I thought it would be. The fold-up wheels are an awesome feature as I have an SUV but wouldn\u2019t be able to fit it in the back if the wheels were not foldable. It is large. Larger than you might think. It\u2019s excellent for colder weather since the kids can be snuggled up with a blanket and it\u2019s super cozy and protective from the weather with the high sides. I have no a single negative thing to say about it other than it\u2019s pretty heavy, heavier than expected, but I am happy to accept that because it\u2019s awesome.",

                "reviewText": "I could honestly be an influencer for this wagon. I sold no less than 4 of these things to random people on our beach trip. This wagon has everything. Comfy seats for two kids, straps to keep them secure, a basket for your items, so many cup holders, a snack tray, a sun shade. It folds pretty flat, just snap the wheels off to make it smaller. The material is sturdy and wipes down easily. The covers come off the seats for easy cleaning. The seats can be laid down for a comfy nap spot for your kiddo. We lugged our 11mo old, a cooler, beach toys, beach bag, chairs, and snacks all to the beach with this thing. And it did great through the sand, even the deep sand. If you have issues through the deep sand, just pull out the front handle and have one person push while the other pulls. Wheels are super smooth and sturdy on concrete - no rattling. Not gonna lie, it\u2019s pretty heavy and bulky, but still worth it to lug everything around. The only improvement I\u2019d make is the sunshade. It was honestly hard to cover even just one side from the sun, so I don\u2019t think it would work well with two kids in there. It works okay when the wagon is parked, but once you\u2019re moving and changing directions, it doesn\u2019t work as well because it just doesn\u2019t cover a lot of area. Other than that, this thing is perfect and is half as expensive as some of the other wagons on the market. Buy it!!",

                "reviewText": "Debated for a long while about purchasing one of these. I knew I wanted to go with Baby Trend (after much research and testing other brands) and I was super ecstatic when I saw the Expedition Plus on sale for $199. The Expedition Plus includes extra padding for seats or to use as a sleeping mat, a basket and side air vents on canopy.Setting the wagon up was super easy and quick, no tools or directions needed. The hardest part was getting it out of the box because it was well-packed.I\u2019m using this wagon for one child, aged two, and we took a stroll last night for the first time.Here are my thoughts:CONS-I was much more excited about this than he was.-Extra seat pads are so-so. Great for the bottom if you\u2019re using them as a sleep mat, but seem seatbelt limiting when using as a seat.-Probably should have had two canopies or extenders on each side to allow for more coverage. Even with one child, coverage from sun or rain will be iffy. I know I can purchase a separate product, but it would be nice for the company to come out with some accessories for sun, rain, winter.-Seatbelt is three-point. There is definitely enough room for a five-point, so that would have been nice as well as a way to recline seat a couple inches for sleeping kids. Not sure how well this wagon would work for two sleepy kiddos. If you have one of those kids (like mine) who wakes easily when moved and can be exceptionally grumpy, transitioning from a buckled sitting position to lying down could be tricky.-Mosquito nets..great until you need to zip them back up..then it takes a few minutes, which is fine..I think you could put them on top of canopy.-Big. Not sure this is really a con, but this might not be the best for tight spaces or busy city sidewalks.PROS-Big. My toddler needs his space. He\u2019s a tall kid and strollers weren\u2019t working well. Excited to be able to use this in the grocery, on trips, etc. Did purchase cooler/additional basket separately on sale; plan to purchase a wrap-around fan and possibly a sun shade extension for summer.-Great for tall people! I\u2019m 5\u201911 and pushing this is super easy. I don\u2019t kick the brakes.-Has space for two baskets (one included).-Glides with ease. Bumps aren\u2019t a threat. Curbs might be..when in stroller mode, but we don\u2019t have curb issues here. Turn radius is pretty great. Haven\u2019t tried brakes yet, but heard they\u2019re not flip-flop friendly.-Caddy is fine. I\u2019ve never owned one before, but this one seems spacious and sturdy. I suppose others might be better insulated.-I live in a house with several steps in front and had to tote (sans child) wagon up the steps into the house (can\u2019t leave outside because of cats and spiders-trust me on this). I used the wagon handle and it was effortless.That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got so far, BUT unless you find the Plus on sale, I\u2019d stick with basic Expedition and purchase the cooler/basket accessory separately. The mats are \u2018meh\u2019 and the side vents really don\u2019t offer anything extra. Expedition (and pricier) models include infant seat adapter.Would I purchase again? Absolutely! Wish they had these when my older two were younger.**June 16, 2022 Update**Still love it! Walks are amazing. Both the boy and I are happy. Consider purchasing two fans for this if you\u2019re toting two kids..or even a third fan for yourself! I could see how this wagon could be a problem for those with limited trunk space (if you\u2019re transporting it) as it takes up a lot of space..or if you might have trouble lifting (for various reasons). Still wish they would have designed the canopy a little better, but like I said previously, there are solutions!",

It rolls smooth and doesn't make any noise. The features are amazing you can pull it like a wagon or you can push like a stroller. It has plenty of storage use for toys, supplies, diaper bags, ect. It also has a mosquito net, and sun shade as well. I really can't say enough good about this product. For pricing, it is mid range for this product and worth every penny you can fins them cheaper but they wont be made like this product.",
