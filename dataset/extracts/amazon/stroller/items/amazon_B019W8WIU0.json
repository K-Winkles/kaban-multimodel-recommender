                "reviewText": "Great suspension! I use it with a Britax B-Safe 35 Elite car seat with an adapter by Baby Jogger. The adapter is rock solid and the stroller is excellent. I bought it on sale and it is worth it.The lower storage is a little tight for urban parents in general, but it is made for running outdoors not errands. Works wonderfully with added storage and it is a breeze to fold. The large rear wheels can be a little bulky for a lot of car trunks but the can be easily removed with two well made latches. This allows the stroller to fold up tighter and you can stack the wheels next to it. ( Just be sure to point both spindles toward each other so that they are protected by the wheel spokes.The only thing that bugs me is the plastic for viewing our baby is foggy. ( Not sure how to best clean it..) But I'm sure we can fix it.All in all GREAT product well worth the sale price.MSRP is a high for me. I paid around 290 for it.",

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect stroller for me and my little one! Really easy to maneuver and I get complements all the time when other people push it for how well the shock absorbers work! I really like the brake (haven't had to use it) and the hand strap on the side (I use this all the time). The bottom doesn't hold a lot of cargo, but the diaper bag will fit under so it's enough for me! I've even taken it running and I felt it did really well and baby didn't get too jostled.My only complaint is even thought it says it is one handed....you have to be really strong to lift it into a car trunk or into a hall closet one handed. I have always had to put baby down and then move the stroller folded.This even worked great when baby was less than 6 months (started probably at 3 months) because of the almost flat setting. We took a neck pillow from one of her bouncers and used it in the stroller so her head was supported.",

                "reviewText": "I love this stroller, it is so smooth and easy to maneuver. My baby girl is happy in it. Two peek a boo windows to see baby and a few mesh windows for air flow. The basket is okay size, big enough for the essentials. There is a mesh pocket in the back for a water bottle, phone and keys but no cup holder. The suspension is great. My only issue with this is that its heavy for me to carry and I still cant figure out how to keep it upright when folded.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great stroller. I did a lot of research on jogging strollers before selecting this one. This stroller rides super smooth and is easy to push. I love that it goes up to a 75 lb weight limit, too.The reason why I am not giving it a five star review, which I really want to, it's because it needed some pretty serious maintenance right out of the box. When I took it for its first run, I was about a mile out on a paved trail and the wheels started squeaking SO loudly that I honestly think you could have heard me within a half mile radius. It was so loud that you really couldn't run with it and instead needed to book it back to the car. It needed oil in the wheel bearings. I have had to lubricate the wheel bearings three times, on three separate days, to get the squeaking under control. It is fixed now but for the cost of this stroller, I really don't think it's right that it immediately needed maintenance to be usable.Structurally, the stroller is in great shape, and I would recommend it to someone else, just be aware that you might need to oil the wheel bearings as soon as you unbox it.",

It is also easy to collapse. The buckles are bit challenging for people who need readers. I can\u2019t see well enough to try to wrangle an 8 month old into the stroller and get the 4 buckles (2 on each side) in place before the little guy wriggles out of the straps and stands up. I hope to get better with practice !",
