                "reviewText": "I was traveling solo with an infant for the first time and needed a bigger diaper bag than my Eddie Bauer single pocket backpack from Target. I had my eye on multiple other luxury diaper brands but couldn't get them delivered in time for my trip so I took a chance on this bag and am so glad I did!This bag has 3 major pockets with so many additional zippers/organizational within those pockets. It is stylish, seems durable, and versatile, I plan on using this as a travel backpack/to take to work conferences as it looks professional and un-diaperbag-like and has a laptop sleeve.For my trip I was able to fit:- 3 Dr. Brown's bottles (2 wide neck and 1 narrow 9 oz bottles) in the front bottle zipper pocket- 24 oz water bottle- package of wipes in the wipe pocket (wish it was a little taller so the top of the wipes packet didn't stick out, but not a deal breaker)- 6 size 3 diapers, a tube of diaper cream, teething gel, tylenol, wet/dry bag in the diaper changing pocket (this is such a convenient feature! you don't have to root around the entire diaper bag to grab what you need for a quick change)- A packing cube at the bottom of the main compartment with 3 outfit changes, a stroller blanket, a formula dispenser/carrier about the size of a waterbottle, a book, multiple toys, granola bars- Other small pockets/zippers held my Kindle, ear buds, wallet/wristlet, thin book for easy accessThis bag also has a sleeve for the provided diaper changing pad and includes a pacifier holder (I fit 3 pacifiers with clips in it). So many features included for such a great price!! This is a must have if you want more space/organization",

                "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW at the end of this as of May 19, 2023We have only had this diaper bag for about a month, but have taken a vacation and many other outings so far. I just wanted to put that out there before I made my review!Our bottles actually fit in the bottle pockets! We use the playtex bag bottles, and they are very tall and very wide, compared to all of the other bottles. I was so excited to see that they actually fit!One of my favorite things about this bag is the changing pad that comes with it, and the hidden pocket to put it in. I also store my wallet in that pocket for ease of getting it in and out without having to take the backpack off (and because it\u2019s more concealed there, rather than in one of the front pockets).This backpack is very cute, but isn\u2019t too feminine looking, so it doesn\u2019t look funny for my husband to carry it.It\u2019s great that it has so many pockets, but it\u2019s almost impossible to put something in every pocket and it still function as it should. So, I look at it as there are several different options as to where and how you can store your things.A feature that set this bag apart from the others I was looking at, was the straps to attach it to a stroller or shopping cart. We have already used those a lot!One minor thing I\u2019m not a fan of, is what is supposed to be the wipe pocket. I can\u2019t imagine any package of wipes being able to use the slot for the wipe dispenser. The slit in the pocket makes that side pocket useless for us, as we don\u2019t want to put our phone or keys in it because they would fall out. I would rather just have two solid side pockets. However, that pocket works just fine for my self defense mechanism that is in its holster.This bag seems to have great durability so far. The material is very sturdy and I\u2019ve not yet seen any questionable seams. I will update this review if anything related to the durability changes, but I don\u2019t see that happening!Overall this is a fantastic bag and I seriously love it more and more each day!UPDATED REVIEW - May 19, 2023I felt it was important to come back and review this backpack. We purchased this backpack in March of 2021 and we have used it every single day since then, more than 2 years later! It has been through a lot and it still looks brand new! I have put it in the washing machine several times with zero issues! I even had to put it into the dryer once and was terrified it would come out in pieces, but it was perfect. (I don\u2019t plan on drying it again just for durability\u2019s sake.)This bag has been wonderful, and is comfortable to wear for extended periods. Even now, as my son is off of bottles, potty trained, and no longer needs much in a diaper bag, we still use this bag for a change of clothes, snacks, etc.We will welcome our second child into the world at the end of June and I\u2019ve not even thought about buying a new diaper bag, as this one is practically still in perfect condition!The only thing that is not perfect is one of the bottle pockets\u2019 top seam has lost some stitches, but it still functions as a pocket and I think I might try to sew it up before we need bottle pockets again. But that is literally the only thing that has lost stitches or shown any type of wear and tear!The bottom of the bag where it sits is still perfect! Zero scuffs or tears at all.After we bought this diaper bag, my sister-in-law got herself one for her family. They had 3 kids at the time, now 4, and had been through many diaper bags that tore and wore out very fast. This bag has also lasted them just as long with zero wear and tear!As you can tell, I cannot say enough good things about this diaper bag! And the price makes it even better! GET THIS BAG! You won\u2019t regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I am actually going to do a review of 3 bags in hopes that this helps others that are looking at multiple brands that look the same. We purchased:1. Babbleroo \"Diaper Bag Backpack, BabbleRoo Multifunction Large Baby Bags with Changing Pad & Stroller Straps & Pacifier Case, Unisex Stylish Travel Back Pack Nappy Changing Bag for Moms Dads, Gray\" (BBR-199) aka BR Square2. Babbleroo \"Diaper Bag Backpack, BabbleRoo Baby Nappy Changing Bags Multifunction Waterproof Travel Back Pack with Changing Pad & Stroller Straps & Pacifier Case, Unisex and Stylish (Dark Gray)\" (BBR-139) aka BR3. RUVALINO Neutral All-in-One Baby Bags for Boy Girl, Multifunction Large Travel Backpack with Portable Changing Pad, Stroller Straps, Pacifier Case and Insulated Pockets, Dark Gray (XH1688DG) aka RuvaTLDR: we chose Bag #2, BR.Summary:Bag 2 v Bag 3Bag 2 and Bag 3 look the same on amazon, but there are small differences. Before I summerize, let me say over all these two are great bags with 6 total bottle holders, lots of storage compartments, padded straps, stroller straps, and all the other features listed in Amazon. They even come similarly packed with the same burp towel present. It makes me think they are made in the same factory or same supplier. I am only pointing out nuances that are not obvious when looking at them one at a time on the computer screen.Pro of Bag 2 over 3-thicker shoulder strap with mesh material-Stroller strap buckles are bigger and feel more secure-front metal zipper feels thicker and of higher quality- leather zipper is of higher quality and added metal rivet adds to the confidence of durability-material seems higher quality-more internal pockets on inside flapsPros of 3 over 2-side wipe pocket has a zipper-included changing pad is much higher in quality with a head cushion and a zipper pouchBag #1I was actually surprised and glad we ordered all three to compare, because I thought this was going to be our obvious winner.What we liked:Access to the bottom of the bag through a zipper along the back - we thought this was a must have.Structure on the bottom of the back (feels like plastic piping linedWhat made us say, \"it's nice...\ud83d\ude10\"The square opening which we thought was a must have was nice and structured, but when we played with bag 2/3, when unzipped, it provided as much, if not more access to contents and we were not as restricted by the structured square openingThe stroller strap buckles on Bag 1 was smaller than Bag 2 and same size as bag 3There is no extra front zipper compartment nor hidden zipper in the back.Same quality change pad as Bag 1 (we assumed this bag was an upgrade to #1)Things we wish all bags had/did better:Have a chest strapHave a waist strap to help position the bag betterHave a longer shoulder strap. All the straps seemed to have the adjustable plastic fastener situated at our chest/arm pit.Have a zippable divider that separates to the top from the bottom with access to the bottom aka two levels of storageHave the main compartment zip all the way down for complete accessWas a little larger (my walmart backpack is 28L which is perfect size to me).In summary, all three bags look great and have great features for our expecting twins. Based on all the positive reviews, I don't think you can go wrong. For us, the ranking is Bag 2, Bag 3, then Bag 1 for our use. My wife and I like the extra zipper internal compartments (she plans to use it as a purse when out with the babies and wants all the storage she can get). All of the things we thought would make Bag 1 our preferred choice wasn't as critical when we factored in the limited access the square opening causes and the less compartment. We chose quality of material of the bag over the quality of changing pad (don't get me wrong, bag 3 was not bad or mediocre, think 9 vs 8.5 on a scale of 10).Hope this helps others who may not have the luxury of buying their top 3 choices to compare.**Note in the pictures the order from left to right is Bag 2, Bag 3, Bag 1**",
