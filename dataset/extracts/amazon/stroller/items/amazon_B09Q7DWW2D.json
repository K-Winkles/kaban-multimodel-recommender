                "reviewText": "So, I\u2019m a mom to 3 already with one and our last on the way. I have done so much research on stroller and baby gear brands and have owned more strollers than I can count.Baby Jogger and Bob are ones that seem to be compared with this stroller a lot so I just want to touch base and say this travel system IS worth it.The car seat isn\u2019t to bulky to where you\u2019re breaking your back to carry like some other heavier brands. The stroller is comparable to the city mini GT but I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that yes the BJ city mini/gt will feel a little better push wise and shorter in the front but that this is a completely very close second!A key difference is too that you\u2019d have to buy an adaptor to use a car seat on the city mini or similar which means having to install and remove the adapter each time vs this stroller that has an almost equal ride with forever air tires like the city mini gt that can go over virtually any terrain without jarring your baby to death.I\u2019m so glad I went with this stroller and I\u2019ll definitely be buying an aftermarket snack tray for as baby gets older because there\u2019s not one available yet for it, hopefully soon! Anyway I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase having owned several baby jogger strollers and a bob double in the past that this will more than comfortable serve us through babies first couple years. \u2764\ufe0f",

Easy to lock and unlock for use. Easy to fold up and works on all terrain. Only downside is it can be a little bulky when storing. I don\u2019t mind because it still fits in my vehicle but might be harder to put in smaller cars.",

There are no cupholders in front, which are always needed when you\u2019re with a child. The wheels are also good either. Even the seat itself is not that comfortable. It doesn\u2019t have a good cushion for the head.",
