He doesn't like feeling confined and would only tolerate a short amount of time in his other strollers. The stroller is easy to assemble and fold up. Only downsides are it is a little bulkier than I expected when folded up, and the cup holder falls off easily. I lost it almost immediately. The seller was responsive when I contacted them about replacing the cup holder and I was able to find an alternative to attach to the stroller.",

You can switch directions for the seat, it lays out into a full bassinet for an impromptu nap. It\u2019s super light so I can lift it with one hand up my front porch steps. It doesn\u2019t have any storage except the bottom basket so I had to add a pouch but for what it is, it really is the best. I will be able to use this for a long time bc it isn\u2019t restrictive to size of the child until he gets to be too tall, but probably not for at least 2 years old. Buy immediately!",
