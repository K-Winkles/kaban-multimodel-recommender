It is a gorgeous dark teal and black and would easily be suitable for boy or girl. The carseat that is part of the set was the surprising factor. It is very well-made and the pull-up shade pulls way over to protect baby from bright light, wind, and unwanted touches and kisses during this pandemic. It easily converts without any hassle. My granddaughter was very pleased as was I. My only complaint was the need for a cuddler to keep the baby's head snug and supported while he's tiny. We were able to find one that fit the seat and matched perfectly here on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "We've been using this since having our baby the first week of March. At first I would have rated this as three stars as I think there are better seats out there for newborns. Our baby was born at 8 pounds 4 ounces, and he just seemed so uncomfortable in the car seat. I will say, read the instructions carefully (and not like us sleep deprived second timers haha) because there's a way to get the car seat to recline while anchored. Now that our little one has put on a few pounds he fits really well in the car seat and seems comfy.The way the car seat snaps into the stroller is... Odd. Granted it's been 10 years since my first baby, but it sits precariously on the stroller where the front that faces you feels like it can tip, while the back that snaps in seems secure. We've used it a lot at this point and no issues so I guess this is just how travel systems are made nowadays.The only annoying thing about the stroller is there's a latch on the side that can be irritating to move in order to open up the stroller. It collapses just fine though. If it helps too, it's a decent size when folded. It fits easily into our Altima's trunk, but is a very tight squeeze in our Rogue Sport's trunk. The space under the stroller is great for a full sized diaper bag (we use a backpack) and the cupholders for the parents are nice too.Overall, I'd recommend as the price is great and it functions very well. Honestly the turquoise color is what attracted it to me in the first place, and it's just as pretty in person.",

The car seat detaches from the base or stroller very easily. The color is fantastic and true to pictures. I've never had a stroller that's this easy to fold down either. All you do is pull up firmly on the handle hidden in the seat and boom it's done!",
