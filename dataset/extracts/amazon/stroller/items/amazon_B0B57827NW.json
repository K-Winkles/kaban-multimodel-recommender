The fact that she could lay flat for naps and be swaddled was great. It\u2019s pretty nice for the price. I actually ordered two to make sure one would come in on time and this one won over the other one. It rolls very well and looks nice. It does take up a lot of room but I had no problems from the airlines about gate checking it. I wish you could buy attachments so any brand of car seat would snap in. Overall very happy with the purchase !",
