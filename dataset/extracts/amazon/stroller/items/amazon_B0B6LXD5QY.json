                "reviewText": "We had a upcoming trip to Boston Childrens Hospital, our daughter has severe brain damage and kyphoscoliosis as well as a tracheotomy and g-tube- she is almost 3 so bassinets do not fit her but she can not hold her self up so she has to be laying down. My husband and I are not ready for the wheel chair with head strap yet so trying to find strollers that are compact (especially for planes), that are one peace easy set up easy fold have been a PAIN! Either they dont lay flat enough ( she has to be completely flat, with kyphoscoliosis the hump in her back at even a small elevation will slump her over and close her trach off or hit it risking pulling out) this not only goes completely flat but we can even zip it up to create a little cabin for when she falls asleep which was awesome! I would love if they would make it just a bit longer on the inside as our daughter is pretty long so she already is almost out grown the \"zip up cabin style\" of this. We loved that it was a once piece stroller pop open fold shut easily because with bassinet styles trying to get the bassinet locked into the base then loading the equipment on takes a bit of time and most of the time were at valet trying to get into a hospital or at the airport people waiting and rushing us we hate holding up the line. My only complaint about this is the undercarriage/ storage, while it actually has a lot more room compared to most strollers and stuff can be put in through the front or the back (i like this!) it is still on the smaller side and is hard to get diaper bag in and out along with suction machine, pulse ox, food bag with machine ect. The front of the storage sits so far back under the seat you have to get down on the grown to reach the button for suction on and off.Another feature that we loved is the removable cup holder, since our daughter is fed through g tube she doesn't take things by mouth so no sippy cups or anything like that it was nice to be able to just remove it or have it attached if our other kids wanted a cup holder while we used the one at the push bar. I would love to have seen other attachments that can be purchased though instead like just a tray with no cup holders that is deep enough her pulse ox could sit inside or her portable suction could sit there instead of underneath as it would give more room for the diaper bag and we would not have to get down to the ground to turn it on and off every time she needed suctioned. Over all though this has been a blessing and affordable! We can find special needs strollers all day but most are big, bulky, or wagons (which we do not like they are too low and you have to store everything pretty much inside with the baby so takes up room or has a bunch of pockets hanging off it making it bulky) those strollers just become outrageous in price in the $500-$5000 range. I don't like being penalized because my daughter is special needs I want a stroller that can accommodate her with out breaking the bank like normal families would be able to buy for there normal kids. So this really helped to make things easier and was so very affordable for our needs. I would 100% recommend this to any parent with or without special needs kids. And would 100% recommend the manufactures to think about making parts that can be purchased to modify to help make this more accommodating for special needs at a still affordable price and compact size.",
