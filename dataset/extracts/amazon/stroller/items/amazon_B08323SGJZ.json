Every new product is put through temperatures of icy northern cold and burning desert heat, long sessions of intensive UV radiation, a salt chamber for corrosion endurance, several pressure and capacity tests \u2013 and finally a machine that shakes it for a lifetime\u2019s worth, simulating two trips around the world in less than a week. Yes, the Thule Test Center is kind of brutal. But that\u2019s the way the world is.
