We\u2019ve spent the last two decades creating revolutionary products that give you the freedom to find adventure together. The mantra we live by? Put quality first and the rest falls into place. This commitment is at the forefront of our innovations. Rugged Beginnings Back in 1994, Roger Malinowski, a bicycle industry maven, met Philip Novotny, an airline mechanic. Together, they brought an innovative bike trailer to the masses. When Roger and Philip began to start families, they were inspired to design and build a jogging stroller that held the same high standards as their trailers. The result was the Sport Utility Stroller. \u201cWe wanted the best of a bunch of worlds,\u201d says Roger. \u201cA lightweight, high-quality stroller that you could still take running, hiking or off-road and fold up easily and compactly.",

Sure you can buy a cheaper bag but this is sturdy and the price tag of the stroller warrants the bag made for it. I don\u2019t see the point of buying a bag where the stroller can be damaged because it\u2019s ill fitted. The only thing is after having traveled with my infant I\u2019m never bringing this stroller again. It\u2019s easier to just buy a smaller more compact stroller that can fit as a carry-on in the overhead bin. You have to take the wheels off and while this doesn\u2019t take a lot of time it\u2019s not what I want to do before boarding. Don\u2019t think about traveling on a plane alone because it\u2019s way to cumbersome to maneuver and hold a baby. With that said this bag will be used for road-trips.",
