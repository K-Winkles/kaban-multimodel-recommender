        "description": "Joovy is an American company that makes vibrant, high-quality gear for your family. All their products, from high chairs to double strollers, have been designed to be useful, dependable, and just plain FUN. Say goodbye to ugly patterns and throwaway construction: you can use Joovy's products until they've been run ragged by the memories you make as a family. Joovy's Caboose is a versatile double stroller that will change along with your child. The Caboose offers you the capacity of a double, but without all of the bulk, and it collapses into a compact form without compromising on weight or build quality. This sit and stand double stroller gives your kids the option to sit, stand, or ride in the seat, and it features a rear bench and standing platform, with built-in compatibility with the Universal Car Seat standard and an option to add a second seat in the rear. For comfort and safety, it includes a rain cover, which fits the stroller snugly but is both breathable and transparent, as well as a sun canopy, so your little passengers are shielded from UV rays. For ease of operation, the Caboose has an easy-tap rear brake, stopping a runaway before it starts, and four-wheel suspension, so the kids can enjoy an undisturbed nap even on the go. As you've come to expect with Joovy, the Caboose has undergone extensive safety testing, and it is manufactured without harmful industrial materials. The Caboose comes in four colors: black, red, appletree, and amber. It meets the Disneyland and Disney World stroller size requirements, measuring 38\" L x 21.25\" W x 42\" H.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller checked a lot of boxes for us when looking around for a new stroller that could hold both our 4 year old and 2 year old. Our previous stroller broke and we didn't love it, so we wanted to try something different.This stroller feels great out of the box, very sturdy, very well built feeling and seems like a solid product. We took it to the mall to push it around to get a good feel for it and after pushing our two kids around stores, I have to say I love this. The wheels are a hard rubber and make for a fairly smooth ride. It's extremely easy to push (this was one thing I was concerned about because our last one, of another brand, wasn't. Tracks really well and you can easily push with one hand; even fully loaded. And the handle angle (which was mentioned in other reviews) didn't bother me at all. I liked it actually). Overall, I'm really pleased with how it performs.Pros:-Sturdy, well built-Rolls nicely, easy to push-Folds small enough to fit in my Honda civic trunk with room left over (could be even more if you take the tray and cover off)-Unfolded, it's about as large as our single stroller that came with our infant car seat. Very nice to maneuver around.-Has a nice storage area along the entire bottom-A really nice design is that when it's folded shut, one entire side is flat. So you can slide it nicely into a truck and it lays flat along the frame.Cons: (nit picking here)-The latch to hold it folded closed is made of plastic. Really the only thing on this structurally made of plastic. Odd choice and this may break down the line. The latch that holds it open is metal.-When it's folded, the leg rest for the front seat has no latch and flops around. Not a big deal but is annoying. If I travel with this on a plane, I'd probably bring something to fasten it tight during transport.-The front tray is a little hard to remove. You have to press in clips simultaneously on either side. I ended up just pulling the kid out of it rather than removing it. Would have been nice for an easier latching mechanism here.-No cup holder/organizer for the rear seat or parent. We plan to get the Joovy parent organizer but would have been great to just have that as a default accessory.Overall, if you drive a car and plan to put a double stroller in your trunk I really don't think there's a better option out there right now (assuming your kids are old enough to sit on the back seat). My 2 year old and 4 year old now fight over who gets to sit there.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This was the perfect stroller for our family",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this specifically for a Disney trip because I wanted a compact stroller that was not a side-by-side. My kids are ages 4 years (40lbs) and 3 years (32lbs). This was the perfect stroller for our family. Both kids had ample room and it was relatively easy to maneuver through large crowds at Disney. I say relatively easy because you have to keep in mind I was pushing the combined weight of my kids plus our bag that we strapped to the stroller. Steering was easier when the lighter weight child was in the front. With just one child this stroller is very easy to push, steer, and navigate through crowds and small areas. The seat reclines almost all the way flat which made it comfortable for naps. Folding/collapsing the stroller was very easy and it fits well in the back of my car and on the park trams. I did purchase the extra seat to strap on the back to make this a true double stroller rather than just a sit & stand. I knew there would be times when both kids wanted to lay back and relax and I am glad I spent the extra money to have a seat for both kids. The extra seat also reclined well for my 4 year old. The only downside to this stroller is the sun shade. It does not provide good coverage for the child in the rear seat. I remedied this by using a light blanket to block the sun. For me this is a downside I can overlook because the compact size and easy maneuverability of this stroller are what mattered most. The one good thing about the sun shade is that it can be removed for those times when the weather doesn't require it. I also purchased the Joovy parent organizer to hold our drinks, phones, and misc items. It is for sure a necessary purchase, because without it there is no storage for your things on this stroller. The Joovy organizer is great quality and has enough room for two bottles of water and two large drinks. I would highly recommend this to any family with 2 or more small children.",

                "reviewText": "We've used this stroller more than a handful of times, so I feel good giving this review.Pros: price, durability, ease of use, fits a young toddler and preschooler, comfortable to pushCons: pulls to the right while walking in a straight line slightlyWe were very eager to begin using this and set it up immediately. Our boys are comfortable using it both in the front seated position at sitting/standing on the rear.I've noticed there is a pull to the right. I'm not sure if there is something I can do to fix this, but it's more noticeable while both boys are riding.Otherwise I I like this stroller. It's a good heigh for both myself (5'10\") and my husband (6') to use without kicking the stroller itself and we like the soft grip of the hand rails.",
