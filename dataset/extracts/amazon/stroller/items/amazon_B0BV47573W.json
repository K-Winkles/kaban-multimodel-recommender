                "reviewText": "***** updated review after 1.5 weeks:I still think the wheels on this is great, but there are some features or lack of that bug the crap out of me!1) there is no peekaboo window in the canopy. Didn\u2019t seem like a feature I was looking for, but without it, I have to stop every 2-4 minutes and check on my kid! Is she drooling? Sleeping? Head tilted wrong?! Who knows!2) no parent tray. Didn\u2019t seem big? But it\u2019s annoying to put ur phone or something u need all the way in the basket. Had to get an add on attachemrnt for this3) the seat doesn\u2019t fully recline . I\u2019ve seen other strollers u can convert the seat into bassinet mode, which would have been better .***********************************************I can\u2019t believe there aren\u2019t more reviews about this stroller- it.is.amazing! Especially considering the key fit is one of the most popular car seats... this works so well with it!We were given a hand me down baby jogger stroller from friends, and thought why not try it out? We purchased the adapter bar for our chicco key fit car seat. However I never liked how secure it felt with the adapter bar, and the stroller itself didn\u2019t have great wheels, maneuverability, or handle height.So even though we had a whole travel system-I bought this 4 months in- and it satisfies all our issues! Took it out first time to our park, and even went \u201coff road\u201d through the grass and trails, and the wheels were great! The shock absorbing feature is a nice added bonus. The brakes on this thing are serious! Even though we were going uphill, felt light as a feather to push.But my fav feature is that I really feel like this is a \u201cgrow with me \u201c type stroller. We also have the chicco caddy frame, that clocks into the car seat- which is light and convenient, but 1) only lasts the weight of the car seat , and 2) it\u2019s soooo much work to get them strapped in the car seat just for a walk in the park!I love how this will work at any age and stage. The seat pops out, and/or can recline to a full bassinet style bed. And as the baby grows ( or their mood) can be changed to different angles of upright, forward facing, or rear facing. And if you want to use the car seat, it comes with a much sturdier bar attachement.Easy to assemble, easy to fold away. It is somewhat big, but as expected with this kind of capacity.One request to chicco- would love to have an adjustable handle ( like the key fit caddy) since mom and dad are about a foot difference in height ;) also wish they sold a bassinet bed attachment for newborns.",

                "reviewText": "I love everything about the stroller! I purchased it because it fit with the car seat I had picked out, but it turns out I love all of the features it has. I love the front wheels turn a full 360\u00b0, which makes maneuvering super easy. It\u2019s extremely easy to fold and you can do it with one hand. It is freestanding without the handle, touching the ground, which is very important to me. It\u2019s sturdy, but still lightweight.I love that the infant car seat securely snaps into the stroller, and that it has an easily installable chair to use later after the baby is no longer using the infant car seat. That chair can also be turned to be world, facing or parent facing.There\u2019s no cupholder on the handle, but I purchased a small clip on cupholder with other pockets, which works great with it. I also was surprised to find a cupholder in the bottom storage basket that I didn\u2019t realize was included.Overall, I would definitely recommend this stroller.",

Great storage space, drink holder was included, pockets everywhere, simple to fold, huge parasol... it's so good. We loved it.What's the point of buying a lighter stroller when this is already incredibly light and smooth to pull (I live on the mountains).I strongly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Like most first-time moms, I spent hours researching strollers. Overall I am very happy with our Corso LE! It's just like the UPPAbaby Cruz for half the price. We originally purchased the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 and were very disappointed with the quality. Went back to the drawing board and ended up with the Corso LE. I was shocked by how much nicer it is for basically the same price as the Baby Jogger, and I'm glad we didn't shell out a ton of money for the UPPAbaby.Pros:-Overall, materials seem very sturdy and high-quality. The frame is sturdy and the seat cushion (with infant insert) is nice and cushiony. The leather handle is a nice touch, and easy to wipe clean.-The wheels and suspension are excellent - almost like a jogging stroller. Baby gets a smooth ride on bumpy sidewalks, roads, and grass.-Adjustable shocks!! What?! So fancy. They work beautifully for switching between smooth surfaces and uneven grassy-type surfaces.-My little one (almost 4 months) seems very comfy in the stroller seat. I love the infant insert and the fact that it can recline enough for a newborn with no head control. My little one started using the stroller seat at about 2 months old.-Great canopy coverage with a mesh vent for air flow.-It's super easy to adjust the seat and switch from seat to car seat adapter.-Car seat clicks in flawlessly (we have the KeyFit 35).-With the car seat adapter, baby can face you or face out. This didn't seem like a big deal to me at first, but it's come in so handy on walks when we turn a corner and the sun is suddenly right in baby's face. We just flip the car seat the other direction and problem solved!-Fold and unfold is incredibly easy, you only need one hand, and the handle stays off the ground when folded (such a pet peeve of mine!).-It's lightweight - It's actually easier to lift in and out of the car than my baby in the car seat.-The basket is HUGE and easy to access from front or back. It has easily fit my large purse, Itzy Ritzy Boss backpack, a couple blankets, and could fit more.Cons:-When folded, it is very bulky. I wish it folded smaller. If you have a small car, make sure to measure your trunk!-For this price, I wish there was a parent tray included (we purchased the Skip Hop add-on parent organizer and it fits perfectly and looks nice with this stroller's aesthetics).-The included parent cup holder tends to fall off.-It's not possible to buy a child tray! Why, Chicco?? I can see this being an issue as my little one gets older.-You can't fold the stroller with the seat facing backwards. So every time we put the stroller away or get it out, we have to switch the seat direction.-The wheels are terrible on gravel. Stick to grass, hard dirt paths, or paved surfaces.-The handle height is not adjustable. I am 5'6\", partner is 6'0\", and the height works for us. I do wish it could extend out just a bit more - sometimes I will kick the back of the stroller as I am walking, as the handle is just a bit too close.Overall, we are happy with our purchase and would buy again!",
