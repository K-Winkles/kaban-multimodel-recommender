                "reviewText": "We bought this stroller for our Disney vacation. All we had was a crappy hand-me-down umbrella stroller so this was a nice affordable upgrade. It has lots of pros and cons. I overall love it because it\u2019s crazy lightweight and stands up on its own while closed. It\u2019s very easy to move around and has cup holders for everyone and a snack tray. My son can easily climb in and out of it with the tray on but the tray also easily comes off. It has a decent recline for sleepy kids and lastly it has really good shade cover which was the biggest reason I bought it. Now for the cons, yes, it has a 5 point harness but I don\u2019t totally love the hardware they used. However, it works well enough so we\u2019ll just call it meh. The shade cover when fully pulled back kind of gets in the way of the drink holders but we\u2019ll usually have it down so I\u2019m not super worried. I wish the cup holders were a bit bigger especially for the child tray as his 360 doesn\u2019t fit well in there. Lastly, we have NOT found this to be an easy one handed open and close. At minimum you need to add a foot to help it out. I think it\u2019s something about the wheels not lining up right that makes it a little clunky when trying to close it. Also weird note, you have to use the locking piece on the side and the stroller actually folds up tighter than the locking mechanism allows. I found that odd.",

                "reviewText": "**UPDATE: I changed the review to 5 stars. I still really like this stroller and I use it almost every day out in my back yard. I've used it on regular walks, at the store, and as i said, the boardwalk, along with my yard and in my stone driveway. It maneuvers just fine and has held up great, though I don't abuse my strollers. I don't really fold this up much anymore because I use it daily, so the fact that I can't fold it one handed just is so minor for me. Still completely recommend this stroller.So far I have only used this twice and I love it. Its exactly what I wanted. I wanted it because its more than an umbrella stroller but not a heavy full size stroller. Its very light weight and folds pretty compact, easy to fit in any trunk or back seat. Other reviews said that this stroller was hard to maneuver and was very hard hitting on any kind of bump even the tiny cracks in the sidewalk. I have not experienced this issue whatsoever. We used it on the boardwalk and I also pushed it around my yard today in my stone driveway and in the grass and it did perfectly fine. Some said their kids were being jolted forward at every bump, again we have not experienced this at all on either terrain type. The basket is big enough to throw in a sweatshirt or 2 and small diaper bag or purse and some toys. Thats what I wanted. The only thing I had to knock some stars off for was the ease of folding. Could be because its brand new that its just stiff, but i am unable to fold it one handed with ease. I have to lift up on the child tray often to get it to close and the wheels don't always fall into position to provide a full fold without manually turning them. It is however, easy to unfold one handed so this issue is definitely minor, at least for us. Overall I completely recommend this stroller.",

It's easy to open, but closing the stroller, you must make sure the front wheels are aligned properly outwards so that it folds easily. If the front wheels are not outward, it will not fully close. Other than that, which isn't that huge of a deal, it's a great stroller at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "We got this after not being happy with the weight or mobility of our unnecessarily expensive maxi cosi infant travel systemat $60 on sale, this Kolcraft is a no brainer! it folds easily, it's compact, there's 3 (unfortunately small) cup holders, the bottom storage can hold a medium sized baby bag, and it's very light weight for the sizemy only nitpicks are that the vent on the top of the cover cannot be closed, it's a permanent mesh net so we had to cover it with a shirt or something else when it's too sunnyalso the cup holders are very very small, they could have made them wider because it's nearly useless for anything other than small/regular coffee cups and most baby/toddler cups cannot fit eitherlastly, i've seen comparably sized strollers that can flatten so the kids can get some sleepi think that would have been a great addition because the angle it can currently go doesn't seem too comfortableassembly was not as easy as other strollers, especially the wheels which really aren't made to be taken apart againeither way, if you want a cheap easy to use compact stroller, this is it!",
