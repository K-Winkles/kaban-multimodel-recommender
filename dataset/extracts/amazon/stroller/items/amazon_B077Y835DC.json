Saw many google searches of buyers saying that the handle doesn\u2019t fit on one of the sides and that they \u201cdrilled\u201d the hole on the one side larger and it fit. We had to do the same thing and fits snuggly in place\u2026.Love the bar but just wanted to make you aware that if the bar doesn\u2019t fit it might be because you have older model stroller. If you feel comfortable enlarging the hole on the bar end you may find it works just fine.",
