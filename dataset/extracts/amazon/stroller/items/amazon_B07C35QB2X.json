                "reviewText": "I think the bench seat was one of the deciding factors for us to get the Joovy Qool stroller. There is going to be less than 2 year age gap between my girls and other \u201cgrow-with-your-family\u201d strollers mostly offer the ride on boards which I don\u2019t feel would be enough for my older one to use when we for example go to a zoo or make a quick trip to the library. The bench seat gives her a place to safely sit l, get buckled, and take a break should she need it.That being said, the triple seat set up with the bench is not perfect with limited space available but we plan to use it with two children only and that gives us plenty of flexibility with the offered configurations.It\u2019s also super easy to set up and take off which I really appreciate with not just the bench seat but also all the other parts on the stroller as this was another reason why we switched from another popular brand - the need of separate adapters for each seat / configuration.Overall I am excited to use the bench seat and so is our toddler who climbed right in when we were testing it upon receiving it.",

It's been very useful in daily life, the twins are 2 now, so they will take turns and take a ride in this seat when big sister wants to recline under the canopy. Definitely has brought a little more peace on our family outings.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 45lbs three year old and a three month old. We use this with a car seat to turn our Qool into a double \u2014 much, much easier to push than two seats or seat and car seat, and fairly easy to navigate around narrow NYC store aisles and crowded sidewalks. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a more compact/easier to push double option.Only two things to flag. First, if you\u2019re on the taller side, you may kick the footrest when walking. (I don\u2019t have this problem at 5\u20191 but my 6\u20192 husband does.) Second, kids have full access to the rear wheels while seated on the bench, so can kick feet into the wheels or pinch fingers. My son got his foot caught on one of our first outings and it was pretty scary for everyone. He learned his lesson and it only happened once, but wish I\u2019d noticed the risk and talked to him about it before it was an issue. Other than that it\u2019s been great!",

But it actually works out great. You will need to adjust the stroller seats/car seat to the right configuration and see which way is the most comfortable for all the kids.I even turn the bench the other direction facing in if i need to and he holds on to the stroller bars on the side. It works for me! He even stands on the seat ! Either way. There is a way for this to work for your family. I don\u2019t regret it.",

                "reviewText": "I like that the bench seat is easy to install and you never have to take it out when folding the stroller. Very light also, so it doesnt add much weight to the already heavy joovy qool. I do kick the footrest sometimes so when my kid isnt sitting in the bench seat, i just fold the footrest out of the way. My kid fits in it just fine. Now i cant control what he will do while sitting in it... sometimes when bored, he does reach for the wheels since it's right there. And he will want to twist so he can see the front instead. He's finally stopped lifting up the footrest to his chest (like it's a belly bar)... wish it locked into place while down. Still a great addition to the joovy qool.",
