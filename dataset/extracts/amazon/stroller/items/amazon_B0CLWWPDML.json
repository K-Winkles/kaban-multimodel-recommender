It folds up super easy and surprisingly takes up less room in my trunk than my stroller. The Zip off front and rear storage pockets are enough space that I probably won\u2019t be using my diaper bag but there is also plenty of room under the seats. The Removable Canopy takes second to instal/remove. I love that the seats are convertible and can be used many ways. The seats have to be removed in order to fold up the wagon but the clips easily slide on and off. The snack tray can also easily be installed/removed as well as the two parent cup holders. Very well made, sturdy and durable!",

The seats are removable and can be turned in different directions. Everything you could want.

It has seats to accommodate two children and enough space to carry their purchases. It has a removable awning, front and rear storage pockets, snack tray and cup holder. It is comfortable, excellent quality of materials and super light to push. We really love that.",

They both fit comfortably and have plenty of space. I love that it comes with cup holders in the middle and on both sides so everybody can put their drink down. The wheels allow you to push the wagon through grass uphill and downhill relatively easy which is great for off path adventures at the park! Our kids love the roof attachment that has curtains to protect them from the cold when the weather doesn\u2019t play nice!Overall, the quality is amazing and I Would definitely recommend purchasing this wagon!",

They are so difficult and I swear the clips will break soon with the amount of force needed to get them on and off. You also can not fold the wagon with the seats still in it so you will be taking them off and putting them on often. For almost the samePrice I would get the wonderfold W2",
