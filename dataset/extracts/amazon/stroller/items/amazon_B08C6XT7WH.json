                "reviewText": "We had been looking for so long for the perfect travel system for our little one on the way. We knew we wanted Graco but there\u2019s so many mixed reviews so it was hard to pick. This system had an amazing promotion so we decided to try it out with the knowledge that we could return if necessary.It\u2019s super easy to assemble. Comes with the pramette attatchment which I wasn\u2019t expecting so that was a Nice surprise. It drives very nicely. Cup holders are big enough for standard drinks and cups. Click connect system is amazing, makes attaching and removing so much easier! I love that the storage basket underneath is so big, I\u2019ll be able to food shop and put all of my groceries in it.The only downside that some may have with this stroller (it doesn\u2019t bother us) is that it takes up a lot of space. It\u2019s quite wide, I\u2019d say when opened it\u2019s about the width of a shopping cart. It also folds up pretty big too meaning it takes up quite a bit of space. Both of these things don\u2019t bother us, but if you\u2019re looking for a more compact stroller, this wouldn\u2019t be the one for you.Overall, this is a great model, great stroller and great car seat.Obviously we haven\u2019t used it with our baby yet so I\u2019ll update later once we do.",

The stroller is super versatile and you can set it up many different ways to for your needs. I love the how easy it is to set up and use, it even comes with a phone holder and cup holder. Wheels are big and do well on different terrains, but aren\u2019t clunky. Super cute, I love the color the most. It\u2019s surprisingly very light weight, so even healing moms can pick it up easily.",

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect mix of affordable and innovative. As a seasoned momma who last bought a stroller in 2014, this is a wonderful upgrade. Graco thought of really nice editions and upgrades in this stroller! I love that baby is height adjustable and that every seat option can be rear facing or forward facing. I absolutely love the cradle option! The wheels glide so smoothly. Set up was so easy for me to do alone. There\u2019s so many expensive strollers on the market that do less than this one does. I cannot wait to use this stroller when my baby is here!",

                "reviewText": "I researched and then searched high and low for this stroller. I specifically wanted this stroller because many strollers on the market today offer that single cheap cup holder that hangs precariously off the side of the stroller which I absolutely didn't want. The element is only graco modes stroller to offer the double built in cup holders at least as of when I bought this last summer. It is a bit big and heavy. Takes up most of the trunk space in my Honda accord but idc. My concern was the cup holders lol I bought a smaller, lightweight stroller for travel. I do wish the tray between the cup holders was wider and a bit deeper. Modern phones (turned sideways) are too long for the tray and the tray is definitely too shallow to have it turned upright so you just have to lay it flat on the tray which isn't secure or have it sideways somewhat in the tray which also isn't very secure. It makes walking hard if you don't have exercise pants with pockets or just don't want to have to keep pulling your phone in and out of your pocket.I bought the more basic version which doesn't have the single hand fold with the button in the handle, but the 2 hand fold with the spring levers on the sides and it's still just as easy to fold and I'm able to fold it and pick it up to put in my trunk in one motion since I need both hands to lift it anyway. It balances on the wheels well enough but I've had some moments where it's fallen or I tried to open it and couldn't get the wheels where I needed them so it's got some scrapes.It's so smooth and easy to push but it doesn't do well on gravel. Which is disappointing but I didn't expect much because it's not a jogging stroller but I was hoping it would be a pleasant surprise lolLove that each seat mode can be forward or rear facing. Love the click connect for the infant carseat. Love that the end of the seat can be put up for babies while their legs are short and put down for toddlers for when their legs are long enough to hang. Love that the seat can lay flat for naps or quick diaper changes. Has a nice long canopy with good coverage and a mesh opening so you can see your baby. Also has a removable double cup holder and snack tray for baby but I'm not using it yet.I was concerned about the low back side of the basket compared to the other modes strollers and other graco strollers in general. Not sure why they would make one different than the others but fortunately it hasn't been an issue. Haven't had anything fall out and it's still plenty big. I am so happy I went with model. It's great.",

                "reviewText": "When my husband and I first bought this stroller system it took us awhile to figure out how it folds and all goes together. Just don't complicate things and it's very simple. It rides very smoothly surprisingly and I love that the carseat clicks right in. Also love the pramette mode so baby can lay down and nap during walks. It took us awhile to realize that while in pramette mode you can recline the stroller a little bit more up. Lol our baby was more head down before we realized and it was a bit awkward. The bin under the stroller is big enough to fit our diaper backpack fully packed and some groceries. It drives through grass, mud, etc. It's not too heavy and fits in my cars trunk (2013 Impala). The carseat is nice as well. I'm going to be sad when he outgrows it because it's so convenient to just click him in and out of the car. I do wish the carseat had a better infant insert for the babies head. When baby is a newborn and in carseat their neck cranks a little more (like fully to the side because there is nothing to support it *the insert in it is not very supportive) and I didn't want to buy one not made for the seat due to safety concerns.",
