                "reviewText": "Overall it is a useful product. I appreciate that I can click in the car seat and not have to wake up my baby. The only issue I have is that it does not feel sturdy. If I try to maneuver certain ways it sort of wobbles. Obviously this is not ideal when it is carrying your newborn baby. So far hasn\u2019t broken or anything, but currently looking to replace this and the car seat.",
