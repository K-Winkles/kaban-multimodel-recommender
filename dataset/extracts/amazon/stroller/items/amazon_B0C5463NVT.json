                "reviewText": "I am in love with this stroller. It has zero issues on grass, hills, bumpy or cracked sidewalks, dirt or gravel roads. Super smooth ride. Very easy to put together. My baby looks really comfortable! The back of the stroller reclines so babies can lay back and take a nap. I love being able to take the stroller tray out completely. The stroller folds down really compact. We have a sedan and suv and it fits in both. You can pop the wheels off if you need to. It\u2019s very aesthetic and sleek looking, I love the all black color. It\u2019s easy to wipe down with a washcloth. I have no real complaints. If I HAD to mention something that could be improved \u2014 I\u2019m not a big fan of the tray/organizer for parents, but usually the ones that come with strollers are super basic anyway. Not a big deal at all because it\u2019s easy to remove and Amazon has tons of options for different trays or organizers. It does NOT come with the hard plastic clip on cup holders that are featured in Delta Children\u2019s promotional video. You would have to order those separate, but they\u2019re on Amazon. Of all the baby products I\u2019ve bought in the last year, this one is the best one. I wish I had gotten it sooner. I had bought a stroller frame that went with the Graco SnugLock 35. I regret that now because once your child hits about 8 months they\u2019re gonna want to start looking around and not be stuck in the car seat only facing you. Once they hit that weight limit and you get a new car seat, the stroller frame is useless. The Graco SnugLock 35 car seat snaps into this jogging stroller no issue. Get a jogging stroller like this one from the beginning and it will grow with you! I see myself using this jogging stroller for my next kid. It\u2019s great! Also I would mention I believe this jogging stroller is basically the same as their Jeep branded jogging strollers, except a different color pattern and being just a Delta branded one. Not 100% sure on that but when I was doing a quick comparison between this one and their Jeep ones they looked about the same but this one was cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "I got this stroller to stay at my mom-in-laws house because she baby sits my son 2 days a week at her house. She asked for the stroller to come with a Tray, recline and easy on bumpy sidewalks. This checked all those boxes and more. It also has decent storage under and a cup holder, and it\u2019s big enough for a big toddler that\u2019s 99 percentile for his age and doesn\u2019t seem to fit well in many other cheaper strollers. Once I tried this stroller out, I was ready to sell our much more expensive Thule stroller as this compares if not exceeds the Thule. I think the only \u201cbenefit\u201d to Thule is that it\u2019s wider so a bit more stable. But living in NY a narrower stroller is just much easier to get around or make it inside a store. With the Thule just getting in a store is an issue because of how wide it is. Once my Mom-in-Law tried it out she said I picked the best stroller, and she mentioned that she loves the height of the handle. She\u2019s a little taller than me and most stroller handles are a bit low for her, this one was perfect for her. Highly recommend this stroller, not a single bad thing to say about it.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller was the easiest stroller to put together; it came basically assembled and I didn\u2019t have to do much. Walking and jogging with it is a breeze! It\u2019s super light and smooth on pavement, and it\u2019s light enough to lift up and down my front porch stairs. The stroller material is really sturdy and it looks and feels it\u2019s going to last a really long time! Lastly, I really like the placement of the cup holder. While that may seem insignificant to some, it\u2019s really important for me when I take long walks and jogs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great stroller! Easy to assemble, lightweight, comfortable to use, my daughter loves being in it! The seat reclines back for her naps and reclines pretty forward so that she can see everything! Nice storage feature at the top of the stroller for water bottles and cellphone/wallet. Perfect snack bar for kids! The only reason I\u2019m giving it 4/5 stars is because the storage underneath the stroller is pretty small, not enough coverage for shade for my daughter, and it has a window at the top of stroller so that I can see my daughter inside but the flap doesn\u2019t stay put. But other than that I definitely recommend it for the price. Not disappointed!",
