Eventually the Velcro stopped working and we got rid of it. So I bought this to replace it. And wow! It works so much better. Bummer that in an effort to save money I ended up just wasting it.

We received this item before the stroller so I decided to open it and get it ready (yes, I\u2019m that excited). Upon opening, I realized the item looked either used or was previously on display maybe? Either way, the cell phone pocket cover was already scratched and a bit dirty. I was able to wipe off the muck but the scratches are there to stay. A bit disappointed that I paid for a new BOB product and got something slightly damaged. I know it won\u2019t be perfect forever, but I was hoping it would at least start off in perfect shape. Oh well, I\u2019m too impatient to return it so I guess it\u2019s mine. Otherwise, I love this thing and I\u2019m pumped for stroller walks/jogs with my gal.",
