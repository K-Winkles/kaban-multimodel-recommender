                "reviewText": "UPDATED - We've given it a test run and have really come to love the self-standing function versus the 3D Lite, and the smaller footprint after it's folded. Despite the initial issues with the fold/unfold, once we got a hang of it, it is actually a one-hand operation. For these reasons we have decided this would be our travel stroller or for short trips.Previous:Really wanted to like this stroller, but a few things bugged us enough that I got the Summer Infant 3D Lite instead. The main problem is the seat, probably due to the shallowness of it the baby does not seem to be very comfortable in it. The unfolding looked easy enough on the instruction videos but in real life does have a few tricks to open fluidly. We found the folding clunky: to collapse the sunshade, you have to smack it down but the frame is bendy; the final upward pull sometimes does not lock the stroller in place, requiring an additional squeeze. Placing the baby in requires undoing the grab bar. Carrying it on the shoulder with the grab bar works for me but is awkward for my husband with a bigger shoulder. Not deal-breakers on their own but do add up. Was really hoping to love it - only reasonably priced stroller with self-standing tri-fold and weighs only 11 lbs. Unfortunately we can't look past the things that bug us, especially imagining dealing with that every day.",
