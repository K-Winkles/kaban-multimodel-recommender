                "reviewText": "When I first received this stroller and car seat I was going to take it back because it doesn't fit in my trunk easily. If you're upgrading from a one baby stroller to a twin stroller please remember It's bigger than the picture shows. It's like trying to maneuver a train or a bus It's just very big so if you can handle a bigger item definitely get this I think it's worth it. I have a 2015 Chevrolet Equinox so the trunk isn't massive But still I expected the stroller to fit and without me having to fight with it everyday. However I give it five stars because for me personally it's coming handy I do have two kids under the age of 6 months so I need it. But besides that I have a daughter requires oxygen so whenever I don't have the other baby with me keeping the oxygen and all the medical equipment in the first seat is really helpful and when I have both of the babies I'll just have the oxygen on my back and have both babies in the stroller.Now for the more negative part of this review The area for the baby bag is definitely not big enough so if the baby bag storage compartment is important to you then you would really like the stroller but if you're looking for a stroller with a compartment that's going to hold a pretty good decent sized baby bag this isn't probably the one for you When I have both the babies in the stroller Putting a baby bag in between the two is just it's nearly impossible. Other than that it's a good buy. And I definitely absolutely 100% love the car seat that comes with it The main reason I didn't return the stroller because it's so massive is because I fell in love with the car seat.",

I received the stroller first,2 days early then I contacted the seller about the car seat due to reviews I seen and they responded the same day and gave me a tracking number for FedEx and the car seat came at the estimated time it had originally said. So just two days later. They where very responsive and polite. Also it's very big but it's a double stroller, so I'm fine with the size. Overall great product. I just wanted everyone to know your stroller and car seat ships separate",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Double Stroller car seat combo in hopes that it would make my life easier with a toddler and newborn\u2026 Boy was I wrong, the quality of the stroller is terrible. I\u2019ve had multiple issues with the wheels and the reclining ability on the front seat. Likewise the stroller just seems to fall apart every time I use it now, sometimes a wheel falls off while pulling it out to use and now the rubber is ripping around the handle area. Typically I have my newborn in the front in his car seat and for some odd reason the red safety straps will not secure down the car seat. In regards to the stroller being \u201clightweight\u201d it certainly is not and is pretty difficult to fit in most vehicles. Furthermore, the stroller does NOT have a lot of storage underneath and certainly serves more as a foot space. It is extremely inconvenient and difficult to even fit one bag in the storage area. Overall I\u2019m disappointed in this stroller and regret my purchase. I would rather have 2 single strollers or seek other options with a different brand. I\u2019m even more disappointed and upset with the BabyTrend customer service. I reached out initially in the beginning of September in regards to my issues in hopes for a replacement or fix and it took 4 weeks to even receive a response\u2026 then after going back and forth for another 3 1/2 weeks they told me I needed to SHIP the HUGE stroller in to be reviewed for \u201crepair\u201d and stated they weren\u2019t responsible for certain things and it pretty much needed to be disassembled to the bare to be sent to their warehouse because if something like a tray got lost they wouldn\u2019t be responsible. Needless to say I am unable to return the item due to their lack of communication, since I am now out of the return window. Also, I will not be spending my own money for a large box to send the stroller in for repair, that is such a inconvenience. What. A. Mistake.",
