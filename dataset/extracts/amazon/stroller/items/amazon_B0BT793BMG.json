                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Functional and very sturdy stroller-wagon crossover; many extras included",
                "reviewText": "This stroller-wagon convertible from Larktale is solid. The frame is well-constructed, plastic parts sturdy, and fabrics are strong and sewn well. It has an innovative design that allows for either a single occupant stroller or converted to a wagon for 2. Both options are functional but I prefer the wagon mode. As a stroller only, I feel there are better options.That aside, the \"crossover\" is HEAVY. Not so easy for transporting (even though it does collapse somewhat), but it does show a sign of good materials/build quality. Assembly out of the box was harder than it should have been. The instructions are not written very well. Also, the unit I received was even less assembled than the instructions assumed. A bit of trial and error with regards to the rear axle and adjusting the straps/clasps for proper \"stroller mode\". And please note that an instructions manual is included, but it's not obvious. It took me 10 minutes to find it buried inside one of the fabric pouches. I wish the manufacturer would have placed the manual in a clear pouch and taped it to the handlebar.Once properly assembled, the stroller/wagon is sturdy and well-planted. The wheels are beefy enough to handle various solid terrains. Not designed for the beach, but it works well on sidewalks, gravel and dirt paths. Turning radius is good and it's quite easy to maneuver. The rear wheels can be quickly and easily locked/unlocked via a large red pivot on the rear axle. It is clearly marked and easy to use. Moreover, there is an indicator that displays green when unlocked and red when locked...for added peace of mind.Other niceties are the included metal tow bar to use when in wagon mode, a second seat (with harness) to use in wagon mode, and a clear rain cover that fits over the entire 'crossover'.",

                "reviewText": "A few things to note: It is heavy. This is because it seems to be very sturdy and has the convertible wagon feature. The instruction guide is in the basket of the stroller. I had to find a YouTube video to tell me this. My husband and I could not find it! The instructions are good, but it was really helpful to watch a YouTube video to get it assembled correctly and quickly. There's not a lot of assembly, but parts are a bit tricky. No tools are needed.It comes with excellent wheels that move really well, the safety straps are top notch. The hood is great and really adjustable, with a vent. The under basket is roomy. The stroller is really lovely and high quality. The snack, pouch, and cup attachments are nice additions, as is the rain cover. Converting to the wagon is not super-quick, but will likely get easier with practice. I am thinking that most people will just use it as a stroller or a wagon and not convert it too often. That said, the ability to convert it to a wagon does add value to the stroller, especially if you have 2 kids! All in all, this is really a top-quality stroller that should last a long time and it has the bonus feature of converting to a pull wagon.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is really neat and well designed. I like the multifunction style and that you can fold it to a reasonably compact size for transporting and storage. It's not too difficult to put together and doesn't take a ton of time. This stroller is heavy duty and built to last for a long time. It moves around smoothly and has quality all-terrain wheels. I like the storage basket and the fact that it can convert from a single stroller to a wagon, which has been handy for us although we don't use it real often yet. This even includes a 2nd seat as well as a wagon pull handle which is awesome! This has a lot of great features that we love such as the canopy cover and the peek-a-boo magnetic vent so we can see the baby easily on our walks. The stroller also comes with a snack tray and the seat reclines back all the way. There's also interior passanger pockets for the wagon which are extremely helpful when out and about. The material is sturdy and washable which is another big plus. This stroller has all the bells and whistles that I could ask for, and I highly recommend it!",

It's really nice to be able to pull it like a wagon or switch to pushing it. The netting underneath can store my diaper bag or just what I need for a walk. The wheels roll smoothly and spin for easy maneuverability. This will adjust to the needs of my child, when they grow.",
