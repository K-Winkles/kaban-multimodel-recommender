I don\u2019t understand why it is priced as fairly as it is to be honest. I bought it for a vacation/cruise but I can already tell it\u2019s going to be my daily stroller for my six month old. It is so many features and it is much more compact than my Graco.It also came 90% of the way put together. I wouldn\u2019t describe it as super lightweight but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavy either. I\u2019m not kidding when I say the quality is outrageous for the price. I can\u2019t imagine that it will do super well on terrain but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.One of the other reviews said that the handle is flimsy. It\u2019s not flimsy in my opinion but not the strongest either. I was not paid nor encouraged to write this review I just felt like the reviews scared me a little and I\u2019m really happy I bought it regardless of some of them.10/10 recommend. Can\u2019t recommend enough.",

It is also very difficult to fold down it says it\u2019s like one hand fold but it\u2019s not, it actually took me a day to figure out how to fold it down and I was super excited. The instructions tell you but they\u2019re a little confusing. Other then that it\u2019s a nice stroller.",
