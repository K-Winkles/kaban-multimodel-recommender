                "reviewText": "First of all, I would like to preface this with \u201cI do NOT use this stroller as intended all the time, and anything I do I take full responsibility for in the safety of my child\u201d.This stroller has been incredible for our family and my daughter while she spends 6 weeks in a hip spica cast. The straps are incredibly long and adjustable and they fit around her even with her sitting all the way forward to allow her legs to not have too much pressure on them while sitting. The wrap around bar and low profile seat is great for having room around her for her cast yet still keep her from tipping sideways since she is tippy from the weight of the cast. I love that you can unhook the bar from both the front and back to lift it over her head so I can lift her out easily. Technically you shouldn\u2019t use the seat without the wrap around bar, but, I have and I do. Only when she\u2019s sitting at a table at home playing and the breaks are on. Otherwise, it is a bit unstable, but so long as I\u2019m supervising, we\u2019ve had no issues. It\u2019s got a very sturdy backrest for what it is and it\u2019s been great for my daughters continued independence and playtime. I also bought the add-on connector bar and love it. It\u2019s been so nice to attach to my younger daughters stroller and to a shopping cart at the store. It\u2019s made life so much easier to go out and about and not confine my daughter to home for nearly 2 months. She can still easily go to therapy, the museum, sit at a restaurant, etc because I don\u2019t have to deal with an overly heavy wheelchair to get in and out of our car and try to navigate that and my other daughters stroller together.It\u2019s very light weight and folds down small, however the folding mechanism is a bit cumbersome to use to put it away. It\u2019s finicky and hard to engage. Opening it is a breeze though, it pops up quickly and securely, often I don\u2019t even bother folding it down, I just throw it in the car with the handle pushed down. I love the rider option with the T bar and no backrest, both of my girls can get in and out of it, even my daughter with her prosthetic leg on (before she got her cast). You do have to be careful and watch your kids when doing this, the stroller can absolutely and easily tip over if you aren\u2019t holding it steady. I would say this is not a stroller for you if your kids are a bit too wild and like to throw their weight around. Overall though, I love this stroller, I know we will use it for a very long time because it\u2019s great for giving my disabled daughter a spot to rest when she gets tired from her prosthetic, and we will use it again next year when she is in her spica cast again. If you\u2019re looking for a way to avoid using a pediatric wheelchair and keep some independence, this stroller could definitely be the one for you, so long as you use caution, common sense, and ingenuity.",

                "reviewText": "i love how compact it is compared to a regular bulky stroller, perfect for the aquarium when it gets crowded. i wanted to replace the umbrella stroller for something better/cooler \ud83d\ude06 it wheels around very easy & smooth, it could use a dual cup holder, & no storage space, only personal down side. it's sturdy as well, my child sits very comfortably, it also folds up pretty easy too. once you get it i would suggest you sit and take the time to fold it down a few times so you're not struggling in an outing. once you get the hang of it, it's cake! definitely can't have acrylics/long nails if you want it to fold down. overall obsessed. i'm not sure where the other complaints of how it falls over, unless your child just doesn't sit still (which some can't) & my child doesn't sit completely still but isn't trying to climb out. it is a seat not a jungle gym.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this stroller in Navy through Amazon. For under $70. This Is the only one out there that will last you until a child is 5-6 years old. If your child is in the smaller side time of use will be longer! Multiple conversions allow long term use. Lightweight portability that\u2019s compact when folded. This stroller Is all that is needed for any parent who enjoys quality for a reasonable price. Numerous easy configurations to adapt to a growing child. You will be able to push and steer with one hand. Seat covers are removable/washable. Harness style seat belts. Wheels tread smoothly. Includes a sturdy metal bar attachment with a strong Velcro belt to tandem with any existing stroller. Dream on Me has definitely exceeded my expectations. I have been able to \u201chack\u201d more configurations for my 8 month old, 2 and 9 year old..(yes my 9 year old is a on the small side) . I\u2019m positively sure that many of us parents are guilty of piling a bunch of children in one stroller for the sake of not having to make ten trips to return back to a certain area or when on a trip that requires walking all day your biggest kid refuses to walk any further....although not recommended for weight over 55lbs..I have tested this and it still pushes and turns A-OK! I have also tandem the exact same stroller using both attachments to PULL 4 children (8 mo, 2, 6, 9). The kids enjoy hanging on to the handle bar when seated or even standing in the front. You can even have one sitting and one standing! Whether you are on a quick trip or a long trip. Traveling by train, plane or automobile this stroller will be your go to. Compact, quality, and easily stowed in small areas. I have spent and upwards of $1500- $2000 for strollers believing the more money spent, equals better quality and safety. I was wrong! Waste of funds and space. This not just my BEST purchase, this is one of my SMARTEST purchase. I recommend this to ALL parents! Excellent gift for first time parents who have no clue!!",
