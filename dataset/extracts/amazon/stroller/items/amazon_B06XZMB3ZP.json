                "reviewText": "After much debate on what stroller to purchase after having our first baby, we decided to go with the baby jogger city select lux, and I am so glad we did. It\u2019s a great stroller with so many great features. The storage basket holds so much, I fit a full Trader Joe\u2019s shopping trip under there!! There are accessories (to purchase separately) to add on that make it the perfect stroller for me. With our new baby we have the Nuna Pipa car seat that is compatible with adaptors and we added the baby jogger parent console so there is a perfect place for my mommy essentials that are easy to access. The console does stay on fine when the stroller collapses, but you\u2019ll want to remove anything that could fall out or get crushed when doing so. Another one of the main reasons I purchased this stroller was that it can convert to a double stroller if we have more children, which is a huge bonus for me. We won\u2019t need to upgrade our stroller since it has the ability to add an additional seat! We haven\u2019t used this stroller with the toddler seat yet since my son is still a baby.A few things to note: it is a pretty big stroller since it does have the ability to convert to a double stroller. It\u2019s a bit long too but you get used to it and it\u2019s really easy to maneuver. I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and I feel like the hight of the handle bars on the stroller is just the right height for me. Anyone that is shorter and this stroller might be too tall for you. But definitely go to a retailer that carries this so you can test it out of possible. If you\u2019re tall, the handle bar can easily be adjusted for you. There is a tab on top of the handle bar that adjusts for you.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 2016 Baby Jogger City Select tandem double stroller (standard version). I previously had a 2016 Nuna Pipa that I attached with a different adapter, but that car seat was damaged, so I just replaced it for my newest baby with a Nuna Pipa manufactured in 12/2019 (Standard Pipa, not a Lite), which unfortunately requires a different adapter. This adapter works great on the top slot, closest to the handle. The seat attaches and detaches easily. I have NO idea what the red tab is for. The handlebar strap strikes me as the equivalent of a back-up parachute. I personally don't think it's critical, but I'll generally use it because, despite being 5'2\", I often fully extend the handlebar anyway to leave room in front of the Pipa for my Diono storage attachment for cups and phone.",

This was not a prime item so I had to pay for shipping and it took a bit longer than usual, but we are happy to have a functioning stroller setup now.",

                "reviewText": "So after MUCH searching and finding very little information, I knew it was important to leave a review. I have the Maxi Cosi Mico Max 30 infant seat and the City Select Lux stroller. I struggled with these adapters for hours!! The LEFT adapter goes on the left when FACING the stroller from the front, not like if you were pushing it. I struggled because the stroller will allow you to insert them incorrectly, but then the car seat will not attach. So again, each adapter is indicated as left and right and the correct insert is when you are facing the front of the stroller. Once I did that, it was EASY. The car seat clicks right in. To release, you press the two little gray tabs on the left and right side of the car seat. After speaking with somebody who sells the adapters, NO the tethers do not tighten.",

It takes a bit more effort to place the car seat onto the stroller than when using the nuna ring adapter with my other stroller, but I needed the double stroller and this helped fit the bill! Quick tip: To remove the Pipa, you need to press the two top buttons at the same time and wiggle\u2026it\u2019s not smooth\u2026but it works!",

If you put the car seat on the top (which all the moms would prefer this way, you can not put the second seat facing out. and there is no way i am facing my child in to stare at a car seat . That will be the most miserable ride for the baby and I. If you try to do this there is a high chance of baby hitting the forehead not eh car seat , this is ridiculous. I wish I knew i would not have bought the stroller.",

If you place the adapter on the sides that they are labeled for you can only back face the car seat, hope this helps!",
