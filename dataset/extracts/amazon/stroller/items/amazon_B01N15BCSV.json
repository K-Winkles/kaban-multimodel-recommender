        "description": "Joovy is an American company that makes vibrant, high-quality gear for your family. Joovy's Caboose Too Ultralight is an ultralight double stroller that will change along with your child. Just like the original Caboose, the Caboose Ultralight offers you the capacity of a double, and it collapses into a compact form without compromising on weight capacity or build quality. This double stroller features a rear seat and standing platform, with built-in compatibility with the Universal Car Seat standard. For comfort and safety, it includes a rain cover, which fits the stroller snugly but is both breathable and transparent, as well as a sun canopy, so your little passengers are shielded from UV rays. For ease of operation, the Caboose has an easy-tap rear brake, stopping a runaway before it starts, and four-wheel suspension, so the kids can enjoy an undisturbed nap even on the go. As you've come to expect with Joovy, the Caboose Ultralight has undergone extensive safety testing, and it is manufactured without harmful industrial materials. The Caboose Ultralight comes in a graphite color, and meets the Disneyland and Disney World stroller size requirements, measuring 38\" L x 21.25\" W x 42\" H.",

                "reviewText": "I have to start off by saying I LOVE this stroller! I have tried other tandem strollers and this is BY FAR the best out of all of them. Assembly was really quick and easy-I had it together in less than 20 minutes and ready to head out the door. It glides perfectly and it's so light whether I'm pushing or carrying it.I was surprised by how spacious and large the two seats are, considering how light and compact the stroller is. My kids are 4.5 and almost 2, and they have plenty of wiggle room. The adjustable straps on each seat are easy to tighten or loosen depending on our needs, and I appreciate that the front footrest can be in an upright or lowered position. I also like that each seat can recline, which is perfect for long days at a theme park or even just nap-time when we're out and about.The canopy is huge, which is absolutely perfect to me. My kids never complain about the sun being in their eyes because the front hood covers the majority of the front seat, and the canopy extender covers the back. I like the square design because it makes being under the canopy feel more spacious. The canopy extender zips right onto the parent organizer which is another great feature. I love having access to my keys, phone, and water bottle. The zippered pocket is great because I don't worry about things falling out. I also like that the front seat has a child tray for snacks and drinks, which are must-haves for my kids. The storage basket underneath is large and can hold quite a bit. The only downfall is that the child's feet hang into the basket when they're riding in the rear seat. That's not a huge deal to me, but it's worth noting.My favorite feature of this stroller is the various seating possibilities. If you have a newborn and a young child, you can attach the included car seat adapter to the front to make it a travel system and have the older child ride in the back. When your kids are a bit older you can use both seats, and then once your oldest is 2.5 you can remove the rear seat and let them sit on the bench. Removing the rear-seat is really simple, too. I LOVE that the bench has a 3-point harness -- added safety bonus. The bench moves forward or backward to give the rider more room, especially if the front seat is reclined. Another seating option is letting the older child stand on the rear platform, which is what our daughter likes best.You can set the front wheels to a locked or swivel position and the rear brakes are linked which is a handy feature. Folding the stroller down is also simple and it's SO compact. It easily fits into our trunk and I don't mind lifting it in because it weighs less than my 20 month old! It's great for travel, too.Overall I love love LOVE this stroller and highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller for with the purpose to use as a double stroller for the airport, and traveling. It was my first solo trip with two toddlers, ages 2 and 4. The stroller was extremely easy to maneuver, it easily fit in the trunk of the car, not bulky for a double stroller, easy to assemble, SUPER EASY TO FOLD (which saves so much time and relives the pressure of folding it quickly before boarding the flight), and light weight.The only cons I have is it doesn\u2019t have a good cup holder, the little sun covering thing could of been better, there\u2019s no space in the basket, and only one kid will have a snack table.Overall it was excellent for what I used it for, it was perfect for the airport and traveling, the kids were comfortable, having the stroller took a lot of stress from me and made it possible for me to travel with two toddlers in a comfortable manner and no worries about folding it, storing, maneuvering.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller specifically to use for an upcoming international move from the US to Japan. For the first leg of my journey, I will be the only adult traveling with 5 children, aged 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2. I'm currently writing this review from my hotel room after using the stroller for 3 days, and 2 domestic flights.(Disclaimer: I have owned/ own LOTS of strollers over my 10 years of being a parent, so I can be super picky).Here are my thoughts on the stroller so far:For a double stroller, it is pretty lightweight. The fold is very simple to do, and I REALLY appreciate the fact it folds with all pieces attached, this is absolutely crucial when you are standing outside the cabin door of the plane juggling not only the stroller, but a convertible carseat and a toddler (all while getting the side eye from the other passengers rushing past that are praying they won't be seated anywhere near you). Speaking of convertible carseats... for the trip, I decided to forgo our heavy Britax seat, and bought a $60 Cosco Scenera from Walmart that weighs around 9 pounds. The Scenera carseat fits perfectly in the second seat of the Joovy stroller with the seat reclined (pictures attached).The stroller was great for getting on and off public transportation because of the ease of fold, its low weight, and its size (some people will say it is huge, but once again, this is a double with ALL pieces attached).As for maneuverability... meh. This is where Joovy missed the mark. PLASTIC double wheels? In 2019? Yuck. The stroller pushes fine on straight level surfaces (like an airport terminal!) even when fully loaded weight wise, to the point where only one hand is required to push it. Turning it to steer into a shop, or a restroom, however, requires two hands, patience, and gritted teeth so your kids don't learn some fun new words. Pushing it in the city on uneven sidewalks also requires two hands, and getting it up curbs can be challenging. The basket on mine completely ripped on first use while getting it up a curb, even though the basket was empty (other than my kid's feet). All the reviews that complained about the basket were spot on, the basket is useless. Supposedly it holds up to 5 pounds, but I wouldn't trust it... it hangs far too low to the ground (probably why mine ripped).I was able to attach a JL Childress cargo side sling for a tad bit of extra storage, as well as a JL Childress cup holder for my large Dunkin Donuts coffee. I love the Joovy parent console (and that it was included!), but the cupholders are really only good for water bottles and sippy cups.The handlebars are sufficiently tall that I don't need to hunch while pushing the stroller (I am 5 foot 7), the canopy provides great coverage, and the tray in front is great for my toddler to eat her snacks (although be wary, the cupholders are too shallow for a bottle/ sippy cup).Overall, I am very happy with this stroller, it has been a lifesaver for my trip so far. I will try and update this review at the conclusion of my journey.Tl;drGreat double stroller for travel through airports and on/ off public transportation. Not the easiest stroller to push or maneuver on any sort of outdoor terrain, to include sidewalks.UPDATE: (One week later)Could NOT have made it through the airport on my own with the kids without this stroller! Carried my kids, and doubled as a luggage cart.Now that we are here in Japan, it has been invaluable every. single. day. We don't have our driver's licenses yet, so we are walking everywhere, and constantly getting on/ off buses. Being able to quickly fold the Joovy, carry it onto the bus, then sit and hold it between yourself and the seat divider to leave room for other passengers is a great feature. My 2 year old has been sitting in the front, my 4 year old in the back, and every once in a while when she gets too tired, my 6 year old jumps onto the board behind her two sisters and holds on while we walk (I'll add a picture).Basket is still less than useful, and one of the plastic spokes on the wheel that hold the brake has broken off.Overall, though, even happier with this purchase than initially.",
