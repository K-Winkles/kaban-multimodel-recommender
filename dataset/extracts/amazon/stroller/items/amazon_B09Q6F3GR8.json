                "reviewText": "Works perfectly with the Chicco easy fit car seat. No attachment needed, just clicks right in. Only downside is the size of the stroller when folded. Don't get me wrong, it gets pretty compact, but in order to make it fit well in our midsize SUV, we have to take the front tire off. It isn't incredibly difficult but when you are in a parking lot, say at a mall, and there's someone waiting for your spot, it's not a quick take down to throw it in the back and go. You have to lay the stroller down, take the little pin off and release the tire. Then with the tire \"dangling\" throw it in the back (because it has the fancy front wheel lock, the tire is attached by a cable).Still I admit, this is a very quality built stroller, jogs are simple, walks are a breeze, and the rain guard works as it should. The adjustable handle height is perfect for my wife (5'2) and me (6'1).It's well worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is fantastic. We've used it at the beach, sidewalks, easy hiking trails, mall, grass, few inches of snow, etc. and never have a problem with it. We literally traveled across country from FL to AK and used it everywhere. (In deep sand just turning it around and pulling it works). It maneuvers very well. Easy as pie to fold. The Chico infant seat snaps into it super easy as well, no attachments needed. Nice large storage basket underneath. Dual cup holders for parents. The sun/wind/rain cover folds down low enough to completely shield your kiddo from the elements (minus the leg area if toddler sized). I have a City Select double stroller as well for when I have both kids in the stroller but I prefer this one even though my CS double converts to a single. It's MUCH lighter than that the CS. The front wheel can be locked in straight if you want or left loose to turn easily. Brake is one handed and quick to use.",

We had purchased a different stroller to begin with (different brand) and it was such a hassle, it was hard to push, hard to steer, my back would be in absolute pain just minutes into using it. Just a really poorly and cheaply made stroller (for a high price of course) So I set out on a search for a better quality stroller that would work with our lifestyle (and go easy on my back) This stroller is it!!! easy to use! You can steer it with 1 hand which as a parent most of the time your doing everything one handed! It\u2019s so smooth! My back is pain free while pushing it! We love it and even better our son loves it!! He asks to go for rides in it every day! No matter what type of ground your using it on either Inside, or out in a field it going to get you where you need to go with ease! My only regret is we didn\u2019t buy this stroller originally and used garbage for the first year. So anyways! Look no further because this is where it\u2019s at!!!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a beautiful stroller! It\u2019s huge and so comfy. Very easy to move around. I give it 4 stars because when putting the car seat into the stroller you have to make sure the flaps on the chair are tucked in or the car seat will not click into the stroller. Also, the peak a boo canopy is hard to see with the clear plastic. I wish it was made out of mesh. Lastly because my infant doesn\u2019t weight much yet there is not much weight in the front wheel. Most of the weight is in the back therefore it makes the front wheel get stuck at times. But it\u2019s a very strong stroller and I know it will last us for many years to come! I still recommend it even though it has those little things. It\u2019s an amazing stroller for theme parks, long walks, malls etc. I love how safe my baby is in it and I can cover him away from germs.",

                "reviewText": "I loooove this stroller! I just got back from using it for the first time. It\u2019s my first jogging stroller that I bought and I did a lot of research looking around for one that fit my needs. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the cup holder pouch thing, it\u2019s a little cheap but it can easily be taken off to add a different one.Loves: You can lock the stroller and the front wheel with two switches on the handlebar. This is great, you don\u2019t have to bend down and fuss around with the front wheel to lock it.The canopy folds down all the way! This was a big thing I was looking for because the sun was always on my toddlers face.Super easy to put together! Took like 10 minutes and everything just clips into place. (No tools required~)The seat and back is really cushiony for my toddler.I\u2019m 5\u2019 and the height is perfect. You can adjust the handlebar to go up/down.The weight is decent, not toooo heavy but also not very light, it is definitely a sturdy stroller.I personally would not use this stroller for walking around the mall or in city places with tight sidewalks. I live in the suburbs and it\u2019s perfect for it. Also heavy duty enough for more rural areas.I\u2019ll update once I start using it more but so far I\u2019m so happy with it~",
