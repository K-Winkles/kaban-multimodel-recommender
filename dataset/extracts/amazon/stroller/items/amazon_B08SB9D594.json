It's not difficult to install... I just wish that it was designed so that it was more integrated to the Bob stroller's design, where it could be left installed, even when not used. Instead, you have to completely install it when not in use, since it interferes with the stroller's regular hood canopy function. Well made, but poorly designed IMO.",

The other thing is that we cannont use the sun shield if the temperature exceed 18\u00b0C. This is a sun shield .... so I dont really understand how this could be of use.It is not hard to install but not easy either. It takes time. So overall, not impressed at all with this product for the price. The only good thing is the quality of the material.",
