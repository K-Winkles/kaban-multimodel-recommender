                "reviewText": "This stroller is perfect if you don't have a lot of room. It is perfectly sized to stay out of your way or you can fold it and it doesn't take up too much space in a closet or trunk. The wheels glide with ease and the straps are easy to use. The pad feels very comfortable and I love that it can turn into a bassinet when needed. The cup holders and extendable shades are game-changing and overall you're getting so much with this system. I am very pleased with it!",

It also has a mosquito net which is easy to release and attach to the base. It comes with cupholders for myself, and for baby, which is a plus. It has quite a few different features which is very nice. I also like the color for our baby boy. It maneuvers around the house easily.",

                "reviewText": "Boy things have changed with car seats and strollers since my kids were small. This Travel System is great!! I have a new Grandchild arriving soon and this is just the perfect thing. Actually, this set is for myself when I take care of the baby.With my first Granddaughter, I didn't have all this and had to keep switching the car seat and stroller into my vehicle and then switch back to theirs. Now with this I won't have to. I will have my own car seat and my own stroller.All is easy to set up and install. I'm ready for the new baby, well my vehicle is...lol And I can't wait.The stroller is easy to fold up and is so lightweight. So much different from when my kids were small. Everything is lightweight and compact now. Everything is just a click and ready.This systems is wonderful and the price is fantastic for everything. So many new features on both of these items. Even the car seat is lighter in weight than my first Granddaughter and she is only 3 yrs. Everything is made of high quality and very durable. I trust everything in this system to transport my new Grandchild.Very satisfied with it and Highly Highly Recommend. Great quality.Would also make a very nice gift.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller took about an hour for me to set up. The instructions were difficult to understand, but it was manageable during the baby's nap time. I am very impressed with this stroller's features and the thoughtfulness that comes with it.The bassinet feature was the biggest selling point and the hidden features of the extended bassinet and mosquito net hidden under the footrest and the canopy made this such a remarkable stroller design. The easy front access from the footrest lift was something that I didn't know I appreciated until after I used it.The handle being wrapped in leather makes it very comfortable to handle. The cup holders are nice and deep for thermoses and coffee cups. The phone grip is probably best for my wife. She doesn't always have pockets so she always has to carry her phone, and our other stroller doesn't have a particularly good solution for larger phones. This grip seems less thought out than the rest of the stroller but still is able to do the job adequately. It's difficult to remove and insert the phone, but if you're on bumpy terrain, the last thing you want to do is have your phone fall out of the tray. but since we're usually just walking on the sidewalk, I might add a small Magsafe mount to this that I add to my bike.The material doesn't feel like it's made from very good quality and a lot of connection points are tied down by, what feels like, unreinforced fabric that I'm concerned may tear over time. The locking mechanism on the stroller also feels like cheap plastic that could break after prolonged use. While none of this is currently an issue in the new stroller, I do have my doubts about it.If you treat your stroller well, this may last you for the duration of your child's infant/toddler life. And if that's all you need, this is excellent for the price point. But if you're hoping to have this stroller for several kids. You might want to invest more in another stroller. This is good though.",

Baby seat is safe, secure and once you get the base secured, it easily clips in and out, and has a nice comfy handle which helps while you are carrying it or trying to get in and out of the car.Not only is this easy to use, safe and comfortable for baby - but Baby Trend thought all about the little things. We live in a warm place so the built in sun protection and a full zip mesh covering will really be useful plus it saves extra cost of buying coverings. It has not a cell phone holder but a positioner which is cool, drink holder, multi positioning recliner, removable leatherette handle - for the price, you are getting a lot of features and a complete system for your baby though to toddler years.",
