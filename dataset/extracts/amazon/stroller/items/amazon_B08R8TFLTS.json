        "description": "The Jeep Deluxe Wrangler Stroller Wagon with Cooler Bag and Parent Organizer by Delta Children is ready to tackle any family adventure. Designed with all the conveniences of a double stroller and the rugged durability of a wagon, it\u2019s a super-fun crossover that makes any outing easy\u2014take it to the park, beach or sporting event. With so many ways to ride, it\u2019s ideal for kids of varying ages. Attach your current infant car seat with the included adapter for babies or use the two seats with 5-point safety harnesses to securely transport older siblings, twins or friends. The UV blocking canopy protects little ones from the sun while pull-down shades block additional light during naptime. Remove the canopy for open-air cruising. Equipped with more storage than the average stroller, this wagon comes with a removable cooler bag, parent organizer, cup holder and multiple storage pockets to keep all your must-have travel gear on-hand. This wagon is the most off-road capable option ever thanks to its all-terrain puncture proof airless tires. Easy to maneuver, swivel front wheels allow you to turn and pivot, and you can push or pull the wagon with the two adjustable leatherette handlebars. To store or transport, the Jeep Deluxe Wrangler Stroller Wagon by Delta Children features a compact fold and quick release back wheels which make it easier to fit tight spaces. And when your children outgrow the need for a stroller/wagon, use it to haul your own gear at the farmers market, while gardening or the grocery store. Holds up to 110 lbs. Weighs 46.6 lbs.",

                "reviewText": "To get this out of the way, it's definitely a large stroller. So if you are looking for something compact that will go into a small trunk, this is not the answer for you. That said, we've brought this to the mall, a large children's indoor play area, outside on paved paths, and inside grocery stores without ever feeling like I was stuck or couldn't get where I needed to go without knocking things over. The width is pretty close to our stand-alone stroller. It's mostly the length that makes this feel large.Pros:- The attachments for the carseat adapter are very easy to assemble and take apart each time you fold it away.- It's not so heavy you feel like it's getting away from you when pushing it around.- It's a really smooth stroller. My youngest son slept for almost two hours with constant motion and lots of noise.- The maneuverability overall is really great.- It's not so big that it doesn't fit where most car seats can go. If this helps anyone, the little stroller parking spaces they have at amusement parks and zoos are plenty big enough to fit this.- It feels well made. The handles are comfortable and you don't feel like you're working to move it around.- The canopy is also great. It has two blackout screens on the sides and then a net screen at the ends which allows plenty of airflow.- As big as it is, it's not ridiculously heavy. It's heavy, but I don't have issues getting it in and out of the trunk.- Space, space, and more space. All of the pockets and the stroller itself have plenty of room for all of your plans.Cons:- There's a decent amount of exposed metal around the sides. Some of it is cushioned, but even where it is padded, there's not a lot. Especially with the car seat adapter installed, which requires you to put a steel bar across the middle of the car seat, my toddler has bumped their head on it a few times. We are buying some small pool noodles to wrap the frame better.- The attachments add a decent amount of width to the stroller. If you need to go through a doorframe, you'll have to take everything off the sides in order to fit through. Not the end of the world, but we run into this every time. To the point that we won't use all the added attachments unless we know we're going to be in a wide space.- Because of the length, it can sometimes be hard to make sharp turns. I haven't found myself in this scenario often, but trying to make a u-turn in a hallway or something similar is difficult.- This requires a decent amount of trunk space. My wife drives a newer Prius and it takes up almost the entire trunk space. On our midsize SUV it fits fine, but it is quite bulky.",

                "reviewText": "Straight out the box I was in love and gave it 5 stars, but I wanted to use it before I wrote my review. So far everything about this wagon is awesome. My son is 4 and disabled. So I want something that he could sit up in or lay down in if he gets tired. I also was looking for something with a lot off storage pockets. So I wouldn't have to carry extra bags for his stuff and mine.THIS WAGON HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND MORE!This wagon has 3 nice size storage compartments and each one has 2 or more sections.It comes with a nice size ice chest that holds about 10 to 12 can sodas.It has canopy with two shades that are great at keeping the sun and wind out.Both handels are adjustable for your comfort no matter if your pushing or pulling.Tomorrow we go to Six Flags Discovery and will let know how it fares when pushing and or pulling for an extended time.But so far it's great.The only con that I can see is that it's kinda heavy and bulky, but to me that just means that is sturdy and well made.So we have gone to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and Hurricane Harbor and I'm still in love. Here are my thoughts.When pushing the wagon it can be difficult when trying to turn. It makes wide turns so when your trying to make even a normal turn it can be difficult. I found myself picking the back up and turning it that way. Making it just a little inconvenient in some situations.When pulling it I have no problems. I know that seems weird, however when I pull, the wagon turns easily with no problem and the weight in the wagon doesn't change that.I love this wagon and everywhere I go people are always asking me where I got it.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE our jeep wagon. It is perfect for us with a one year old and 4 year old. They both fit comfortably and have plenty of space. There's so much space for your things and I love that it even comes with a cup holder. The five point harness is essential for my toddler. It is so easy to push and maneuver through doorways. I thoroughly enjoy pushing my kids in this it's so nice. Amazing quality and even comes with a little cooler and attachment to hold it. Would definitely recommend purchasing this wagon!",

This is perfect and boy is it sturdy. Lots of storage. The only down side is its heavy so Mama who is very small is struggling to load and unload in the back of her SUV but she doesn't care. Said it's been the perfect way to go from parking lot to field with gear, toys and baby needs! They also will be using it to go out to the river for fishing and boating. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "I am 5\u20193 roughly 120 lbs or so. I have a very petite build and I have 2 small children I purchased this for. I was really shocked by how easy it is for me to lift and get in and out of my trunk. I use it for grocery shopping, department store visits, mall trips and of course park trails. If you have small children (especially one in a car seat still) I cannot recommend this enough! It saved my life.I will say it takes up pretty much all of the floor space in my trunk (Nissan rogue 2012). But you can put a few things on top of it and on the sides. It comes with a bunch of bags and attachments but I just use the canopy from time to time. It\u2019s really sturdy and has good steering. I love that it has a cup holder too!! Great purchase and something that can be used for many years after the children outgrow it.",
