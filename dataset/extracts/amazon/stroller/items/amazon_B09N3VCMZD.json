                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect balance between portability and durability.",
                "reviewText": "When the twins were younger, we used a light double stroller (Zoe) to travel but now that they are older and don't need to be in a stroller anymore, we needed a single stroller for traveling. we have a city mini GT for regular day-to-day use and previously purchased a gb Pockit+ for travel. The Pockit+ was very portable and convenient since it fit in the aisle on the airplane and can be stowed under the seat or in the overhead compartment. However, it proved to be rather flimsy and easily flips backward with any shift in weight. We purchased this stroller in hopes of finding a balance between portability and durability.Pros:- Small Size. Although it's bigger than the Pockit+, it is substantially smaller than other strollers and folds quite well. I compared it to the single Zoe stroller and it's slightly smaller in dimensions.- Durable. Despite its size and weight, the stroller feels quite durable and sturdy.- Lightweight. At about 15 lbs, this stroller is very light and can easily be carried with one hand.- 1 hand open and close. Unlike other strollers including the Pockit+, this stroller can be opened and closed with one hand making it easy to collapse at the airport especially if you have things to carry like bags or a baby.- Function. Despite its relatively small size, the wheels are easy to push and spin which is a huge improvement from the Pockit+. The basket underneath feels very sturdy, unlike the Zoe which is just a net. The seat can be easily adjusted to a lying position for naps. I like having the braking mechanism in the middle instead of to the side since this is easier to press and release. The leg rest can be adjusted up or down depending on preference. This is great for naps since the stroller essentially becomes a bed for the child.- Price. This stroller I substantially less expensive than both the Pockit+ and the Zoe.Cons:- Backrest. The backrest does not come to a completely upright position and maxes out at 30-45 degrees.- Shade cover. The shade cover is short and does not fully cover the stroller so the sun may be in her eyes when she lays down to sleep.- Freestanding. When folded, the stroller can stand on its wheels but the wheels need to be in specific positions, or else the stroller will fall over.- Carrying. Without the guard rail attached, there is no handle to carry the stroller when it's folded.Overall, we love this stroller and it will easily replace the Pockit+ that we previously used. It's a little bigger so we may be asked to gate-check the stroller rather than be allowed to carry it on the plane like the Pockit+. I am hoping to find a bag that will fit the stroller nicely so they can see that it is smaller in dimensions than most people's carry-on luggage. For portability purposes, removing the guardrail will make it fit into smaller dimensions. We use a thin dark blanket to cover the stroller when the baby naps which can be easily tucked or tied around the leg rest on the bottom and tied to the bar at the top. Put the blanket behind the baby's back when she's sitting up to compensate for the angle of the backrest.At a fraction of the price of the gb Pockit+, this stroller is great for travel and definitely worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "We already have a Baby Jogger stroller we love, but it's too bulky to deal with for a vacation so we wanted something smaller and easier to travel with that could potentially even go into the overhead storage. This is exactly that. It folds easy and into a very small, manageable size that can easily get even smaller by popping off the handle and/or tires. What surprised me is how solid of a stroller it is. I figured that kind of portability would come with a big downgrade in quality. While the Baby Jogger is better, this actually maneuvers around way better than I expected. The tires are good. And it feels like good quality/comfortable for the kid. It even has underneath storage and one of the screens on top to peak in on your kid through. I think it's worth the little extra to pay for a nice travel one like this rather than getting a real cheap one. We may even use this around town some if we know we're going somewhere more crowded or narrow.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros:I really like this stroller for travel. We have travelled with our Uppababy Vista Cruze and it travels well if you don\u2019t mind gate checking and have space for luggage in rental car. We bought this stroller because our child is a little older (2) and sometimes refuses to ride and we were going to be in Greece for 13 days and on ferries and small rental so space was precious!The stroller is quite compact when folded up and the grab bar becomes the handle to carry or roll the stroller. Rolling the stroller while folded is a little tough for adult sized humans because you have to bend over a bit to roll it, but it\u2019s lightweight and easy to carry when necessary. The folded stroller fits in overhead bins in plane when the grab handle is removed (also super easy to do). It even fit on a small prop plane overhead bin after removing back wheels (very easy to done once you know how).I feel the stroller was easily maneuvered on many terrains. The stroller rolls & turns very easily and the lock works well. We were on all kinds of surfaces from inside buildings, sidewalks, cobblestone, gravel & even sand. It worked great on all (except soft sand).Stroller has a sunshade. Many of the travel strollers we researched didn\u2019t have anything so this was a nice bonus and doesn\u2019t make the stroller bulky. It\u2019s not super effective (see cons), but I believe anything is better than nothing!Another nice to have is the storage basket. It is super small and I wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold anything heavy (assuming you could get it into the basket), but it is nice to hold the grab bar if your child doesn\u2019t like having it on there or a very small lightweight bag for diapers / wipes / change of clothes. My child\u2019s small backpack was too big, but her small diaper / wipe holder fit easily.Cons:Instructions / manual is vague and packaged inside the stroller so you have to open the stroller to get the information on how to properly open the stroller. When opening for the first time, I severely pinched my finger by trying to \u201chelp\u201d the stroller lock into place. User error and ignorance on my part, but if instructions had not been inside the stroller - I might have known better where to expect the stroller to connect. I had even read a negative review of the stroller that mentioned almost losing a finger when attempting to open it. \ud83d\ude41. I highly recommend using caution when first getting to know the stroller and keeping young ones from attempting to open it to avoid issues.The stroller in fully upright position is still pretty reclined. My daughter often just sat up straight on her own without the support and the 5 point harness didn\u2019t restrict her from going this, but still kept her in the stroller, but the upright position is more of a \u201creclined\u201d position. In order to lay the seat down it is manually adjusted by the straps in the back. They are relatively easy to adjust down with child in the stroller, but adjusting back to upright was much more challenging with child in the stroller. Much easier when the child is removed to resume upright position. The fully reclined position is almost flat and seemed pretty comfortable for my little one.The sunshade is a nice addition, however it often only covered my child\u2019s head / face. In Greek full sun, we still needed to sunscreen well and reapply to avoid over exposure to sun.I\u2019m giving it 4 stars because I feel like it\u2019s a great travel stroller and I would buy it again & recommend to a friend with the caveats in the cons. It worked perfectly for our trip to Greece and it will be useful for future trips as well.",
