                "reviewText": "Ok, I have 6 kids and have used a lot of strollers, but for this season of life, this stroller is THE BEST. Let me explain why so you can decide if it\u2019s the best for you too.What\u2019s GREAT (I haven\u2019t found a stroller that does it better):Snack trays - It comes with snack trays!!!Toddlers need snacks to be happy. Therefore, snack trays make me happy.Baskets - The baskets are amazing - you can reach them from the front and back, they are big, and they hold a lot of weight.Foot lock - The lock is really easy to use, you can do it in a flip flop without chipping your polish \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.Here\u2019s what\u2019s GOOD (and I only say good and not great because there might be a stroller that does it better, there just isn\u2019t another stroller does does all of these things together better):Fold - It\u2019s a two hand fold for me. I\u2019ve had one hand fold strollers so it gets a B in this category but even two handed it\u2019s a very easy fold.Weight - A couple of strollers are lighter but this one is more than reasonable for my 5\u20193\u201d, 120# self to throw in the van.Compact - We had major problems fitting all of our other strollers in the very small space behind our cargo van seats but this one fits! It\u2019s a very flat fold.Width - There are skinnier strollers but I haven\u2019t found a doorway we didn\u2019t fit through yet.Sunshade - It honestly feels flimsy but I think it\u2019s a deceptively strong fabric because I abuse it daily and there are no holes. It\u2019s big enough (there are bigger) and it has a zipper to look through/move it lower. If you want a clear window to look through this stroller doesn\u2019t have it. But I just peek around and look? Not having a window is a non-issue for me.Seats - They aren\u2019t completely flat but they are pretty close. Good enough for my 3 month old to being able to ride in and my 18 month old to nap in. They are a little tedious to put back up but most are. Especially at this price point. It\u2019s still easier than my bob \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Their width is great for now but if you\u2019ve got really big kids might get a little tight. Part of the sacrifice for a skinny stroller though.Off road capability - This is not an off road stroller. If your priority is a smooth ride on rocky terrain get a bob. It\u2019s the best. But that sucker is heavy and bulky!! And you know what?? This stroller is pretty darn good! I\u2019ve taken it to baseball, soccer, horseback riding and it\u2019s done exceptional. I\u2019m not going on a hike with it or in the sand but it holds its own on a wide variety of terrain and is still really easy to push with no instability.Price - For what you get, not bad! But it sure would be nice if strollers weren\u2019t a car payment \ud83e\udd2a.Hope this helps someone on the fence! If you have a very specific need in one category this may not be the stroller for you but if you need a jack of all trades, pretty great at everything stroller, this one\u2019s for you!",

                "reviewText": "After one year of frequent use, I am still in love with this stroller. It was the product of hours of research, and it was definitely the best choice we could have made. This stroller has lasted through many airports, amusement parks, bumpy sidewalks, and fairs full of gravel paths and grassy fields and is still going strong.The number one benefit of this stroller is the maneuverability. I can navigate crowded zoo sidewalks with one hand while holding a screaming baby in the other. When the toddler wants to walk, I can hold his hand while still pushing the baby with the other. It is SO EASY to push! It\u2019s definitely not made for off-roading, so some gravel paths can be hard, but overall it still does the trick no matter where we are.My husband didn\u2019t want a side by side because he was convinced it wouldn\u2019t fit through doorways. He\u2019s now sold on this stroller and recommends it to everyone. We\u2019ve never had a problem with the width in our year of use. It\u2019s narrow enough to maneuver easily through crowds and doorways, and I love that the kids can sit beside each other and get up and down easily.The stroller is lightweight with plenty of storage. The materials seemed cheap at first, but it\u2019s held up very well over the past year (and we haven\u2019t gone easy on it!) I love the zip pockets on the back for my phone and keys!The only con for me is the recline. It is tricky to recline and the stroller has to be stopped and locked to do it. It makes it difficult when trying to keep sleeping babies sleeping! Overall, not a dealbreaker for us as everything else is so perfect!If you have two little ones, buy this stroller!",

                "reviewText": "We absolutely love this stroller. We initially purchased a cheaper stroller but it didn\u2019t seem like it was going to last. My son is: 3 years old, 38 inches tall and 35 pounds, so he is on the bigger side. He fits comfortably and loves sitting in it. We did always leave the seat extender out for him because of his size, but it seemed sturdy. My daughter is on the smaller side: 2 years old, 32 inches tall and 22 pounds, so she doesn\u2019t need the leg extender out but she likes to leave it out since her brother does. We bought this stroller for an upcoming trip to Florida and I expect it to work next year as well. For an overview, the stroller pushes incredibly smoothly and can even be maneuvered one handed if needed. The storage space is great we can fit our large diaper bag under one side and a backpack under the other side. The tray is a really nice feature and was well designed. It is easy to take on and off and you can even drop down one side they can get out easier, since the tray joint swivels. The tray can be left on when folded or removed to make it more compact. The shade is nice and can close almost to the tray it also has a nice peak a boo window to check on sleeping kids. Opening and closing the stroller is really easy and it is a nice shape when folded. It also stands on its own which is so helpful when juggling kids and suitcases. Ultimately, I am so glad we decided to make the invest in a stroller that will last longer. Plus my kids loved it!",

The length fits doorways and lifts easily here in SG too, that\u2019s a plus. Love that it comes with removable snack trays which doubles like a belly bar which most double strollers don\u2019t have.",
