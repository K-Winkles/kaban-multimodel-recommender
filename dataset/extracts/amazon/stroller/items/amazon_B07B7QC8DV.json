                "reviewText": "I bought this side by side double stroller because my other double is so big and long that it doesn't fit in doctor offices. I had low expectations but this stroller is awesome! Its easy to fold, has a shoulder carry strap, is not nearly as heavy as my other stroller and fits really well in my car! I have a 2020 Honda pilot and this stroller can stand up in the cargo area and I can fit my big trunk organizer on 1 side and 4 carry on suitcases lined up on the other side of the stroller with room in front for last minute packing as well.As an additional plus my Chico key fit 30 carseat for the baby actually drops in and fits really well between the seat and roll bar....not made to fit, doesn't click in or anything but it works and that was a huge plus for me to not have to take the baby out of the infant carseat.I dont think you could get 2 infant carseats to fit next to each other but works fine for the toddler on 1 side and baby on the other.Also steers great, can do 1 handed on most any terrain. Have done pavement, gravel, dirt, and grass. Fantastic stroller and very affordable. Recommend it to everyone.",

To preface my review, I already have an Uppababy Vista V2 and an Evenflo- Pivot Xplore, which are also GREAT products. However, I was in the market this time to find a double stroller that my 2 and 4 year old could fit in that did not require a lot of drama when it came to loading, unloading, and traveling to different places with different terrain.Pros:\u2022 Fit my average size 2 (very soon to be 3) and 4 year old boys\u2022 Price point! Similar strollers cost double! I was considering buying more expensive brands second hand, but when I saw how worn down they could get after use at a consignment store, I said NO WAY to paying $700 for a stroller like this for it to turn out looking like THAT. This stroller is worth the money and some.\u2022 I was able to maneuver stroller with one hand (woo!)\u2022 Travelled through different grounds- including rocks and dirt\u2022 Fit through clear halls on a cruise!\u2022 Fits through average size doorways\u2022 Kids were able to lie back comfortably enough to take a nap\u2022So EASY to set-up and fold to put away\u2022 Large storage basket\u201cCONS:\u201d\u2022 Seats are a little on the smaller side, but the adjustable leg rests make up for it\u2022 Set-up like a jogging stroller, so the seats are a tiny bit reclined\u2022 No cup holderOverall, 10/10 for design, price, quality, and function!",

                "reviewText": "I can't tell you how much I LOVE this stroller! When we planned a trip to Disney world back in February, I knew we needed a better double stroller. I did a lot of research and ultimately chose this because of the price, you couldn't beat it! It is fairly lightweight and has a strap for carrying it over your shoulder. The storage bin underneath has so much room that we were able to store our backpacks, food and all of our necessities while we walked around the parks. The seats recline back which made it the perfect nap spot for my 5 and 3 year old. We did not have any issues fitting through doors or making our way through the large crowds in this side by side stroller. It is very easy to maneuver. My favorite part about the stroller is the swing out child bars. It allowed the kids to sit safely in their seats without having to buckle them in every time. My only complaint is that I could not find a travel bag for this size stroller. Other than that, I absolutely love this stroller and wish I had purchased it when my kids were younger. I recommend this stroller to all my friends/family when they ask for stroller recommendations! Great buy!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased and returned 3 double strollers before I found this and knew immediately it was \u201cthe one.\u201d I have a 2.5 yo and a 6 month old and I was trying super hard to avoid the side by side style because I didn\u2019t want anything bulky and wanted to fit through standard doors when out and about. First I tried the sit and stand style (awful maneuverability, very clunky) and returned. Next I spent $600 on the City Select double and found it smooth but very hard to open and close, and frustrating that both seats had to be detached before folding. I also felt like my 2.5 yo was on the verge of growing out of the city select. I was about to pull the trigger on a double Bob when I randomly found this Jeep stroller on Amazon and noticed it had high reviews. The first thing I noticed was the stylish design. It looked slim for a side by side. After reading that others found it maneuverable and easy to use I pulled the trigger- and it has been the best $200 I\u2019ve spent. Putting it together was as simple as popping on some wheels. The wheels are not rubber but they have a rubber feel and work well on various terrain. It is SO smooth. You can push two kids with one hand and it turns on a dime. Not to mention, it looks much more expensive than it is. We love how easily it folds down and the carrying strap. It\u2019s pretty light compared to the other doubles we tried. Both our infant and toddler are super comfortable. I wish it reclined a touch more but it\u2019s plenty for a nap. My only other wish would be for a parent cup holder but I\u2019ve been fine to toss my water bottle in the basket underneath. The most important things to me were maneuverability and a sleek design. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find that in a double but this stroller proved me wrong. I shopped in many stores with this thing yesterday and fit through every doorway I tried. If you\u2019re looking for an awesome double, try this before spending a fortune!",

                "reviewText": "This stroller went above my expectations for the doubles I found within my budget. I was hesitant about Jeep brand because I have a single Jeep stroller that failed me while at Disney. But this one is great!Pros: extremely easy to operate (folding, steering, carrying), it\u2019s very compact and lightweight when folded (more compact than all 3 of my single strollers), sun shades come down really far, comfy for both my 5 month old and 2.5 year oldCons: shallow seat depth, wish it reclined one step lower, no snack trays",
