        ],
        "description": "This Joovy ScooterX2 includes 2 Child Trays, but does not include the Bumper Bar. The larger 7-inch front wheels and 9.5-inch rear wheels make it easier to maneuver than before. Its lightweight and narrow design allows the stroller to fit through any door while providing ample room for your kids. The width of the stroller is 30 inches, so there's no need to fold it to get inside a door. The wheels have sealed bearings so pushing two kids totaling 90 pounds is easier than you could imagine; And, the double front wheels make the stroller extremely stable. This is especially important if your kids climb in and out of the stroller by themselves. The basket is bigger than any stroller basket on the market, period. The canopy is bigger than any other stroller on the market, too. Each seat is fully adjustable, independent of the other, and each has its own in-seat mesh pocket and adjustable 5-point harness. You will love the 1-hand recline system that locks into an infinite number of positions - all the way down to a near flat napping position. We have also included 2 cup holders for the parents and 2 zippered pockets for phones, wallets, snacks, etc. Folding takes just seconds with the 1 hand fold feature. The Scooter X2 gives you the features you demand, the fashion you expect and the quality Joovy is known for - all at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Heavy & Bulky, but lots of advantages",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE: 1 year and 3 months later... I am getting rid of this stroller. It is WAY too heavy for me. With my son just turned 4 year-old in one seat and now 18 month-old baby in seat, I have to use 2 hand to push and maneuver at all times. Both kids still fit just fine. Besides, the 4 year-old is now walking most days the 4 blocks back and forth to the school, when we take our 2nd grader. I have a Joovy Caboose that I keep in the car, for when I am out shopping and it keeps the older one contained (He still passes out in it for a nap,) but that thing is a pain to steer as well. I think Joovy needs to re-evaulate their wheels or bearings or something. Their strollers just don't \"glide\" that well. I recently bought an inline 3 wheeled stroller used, that has a 2nd seat that attaches to the bottom. Now, I don't have to carry a single and a double stroller. Now I carry the one stroller, and can add a 2nd seat, if my son is running off, or tired. Or, I have the option to leave the 2nd seat folded flat in the trunk. Soon, we will beyond the double stroller phase anyways and I can just use my AWESOME Peg Perego Booklet. (Seriously, best stroller ever! I can push it around our neighborhood with my 25 pound 18 month-old in it and loaded diaper bag WITH 1 FINGER!)Orignial Review:Okay, I have 6 kids and a new stroller every few months because I think I found the stroller of my dreams, then I get mad at something or a new feature comes out. (My poor hubby had a heart attack with 5 strollers at once in the garage.)With the birth of my 6th baby, I needed a double stroller again, as they were 2 years apart. We have to walk 4 blocks to and from school everyday for my kindergartener and sometimes that 2 year-old just HAS to be strapped down! The last time I had a double stroller, I was an Combi Twin Savvy. So, I found one on Ebay and bought it. Bottom line - great for quick trips, but not a neighborhood stroller and no storage space. So, I had to begin looking for a double again. I choose the Joovy Scooter X2 in charcoal b/c of the trays. (I really wanted the Peg Perego Book for Two, as I have the Booklet and it's fantastic! But, I couldn't justify the $600 price tag, plus there aren't trays for the double, They are the same weight - both heavy.Pros:-My off the charts tall 2 year-old (almost 3 now) can fit VERY comfortably. My huge 6 year-old has even climbed it when he wasn't feeling well.-Great sun canopies-HUGE storage baskets!!! I carry A lot with me. All my older kids are always throwing in a sweatshirt, Ipad, water bottle, snack, etc. With 6 kids and a husband that can't carry anything himself, it all adds up fast!-Extendable leg rest!!! What can't all strollers have this? Great for sleeping older babies, toddlers, and diaper changes in the stroller.-The TRAYS!!! How can you have a stroller without a tray? My kiddos have always wanted Goldfish when out and about. With little ones, you just need a tray. They are easy to open and close ans swivel out of the way.-Deep recline. By the time we got this, my baby was 3 months old. She has no problem with the recline.-My Graco carseat fits!! It becomes a travel system!! If I leave her tray in my car, her carseat wedges on her side just right. Now, I wouldn't go trail walking or over a crazy bumpy serface. But, walking at the mall or a quick errand into a store it works perfectly!-Tall handlebar. I am 5'2 and its a bit too tall for me. But my husband is 6'2 and he doesn't mind pushing it. NEITHER OF US KICK THE BAR!Cons-the weight. THIS THING IS HEAVY! It takes a lot for me to heave it up and into my minivan trunk.-The size, it's HUGE. To go anywhere, I have to take out my single stroller and whatever else is in my trunk - usually a huge baseball bag for my oldest. For this and the weight of the stroller, I usually leave this stroller in my garage. I keep a single stroller and my combi double stroller in my trunk at all times. If I know we are going to a theme park, zoo, mall - then I will switch everything out.-The Stand. Why can't it stand when folded? I don't want it laying on my garage floor. When it's in my trunk, it flops forward and i kind of have to hold it while I am closing the trunk door.-The cup holders and zippered pouches on the back of the stroller are currently useless. We live in Memphis and it's HOT!! (110 heat indexes currently.) To walk at all, I roll up the back of each seat to get more air into the stroller. THERE IS NOTHING TO HOLD THESE UP! No velcro, little ties, or anything. I have to fold them over the canopy. If the canopy is closed, then I can shove them in the folds of the canopy. BUT...this also mean that I can't use any of the cup holders or storage pouches on the back of the stroller. So, I had to buy a double stroller organizer. No big deal, but it was an extra $25 bucks.-There are cracks right next to the part you twist to close the stroller. For $250, I wasn't happy and sent pics to Joovy. They immediately responded saying that it was fine and that the stroller was under warranty, if any future problems do occur. (Others have mentioned this, too.)Others were complaining that if you hit a crack or bump in the sidewalk the stroller would stop or throw the kids forward. I have had this happen to me once. BUT..the sidewalk had settled and it was about 2 inches higher than the rest of the sidewalk. The stroller immediately stopped and the kids were jarred forward. Thankfully, they were fully buckled, so no harm done. It DID NOT flip. It makes me wonder how fast people were walking / running with the stroller. (Yes, I have seen some Dads at our local zoo RUNNING with a typical Graco stroller.) THIS IS NOT A JOGGING STROLLER AND KEEP YOUR KIDS BUCKLED!My kids have not minded sharing a sun visor either.Bottom Line: This stroller had everything I was looking for at a great price. But, what I was looking for made it heavy, bulky, and hard to transport. If you are going to be throwing this in and out of your trunk a lot, it might not be the stroller for you. If you are looking for lots of walking where even the bigger kids are comfortablem then it's great.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this double stroller for 3 reasons;1. Currently walking to pick my son up from school and need an extra seat since I bring his 1 year old sister with me.2. I'm due with baby # 3 and will need a double stroller anyway3. Disney approved for length/width requirements.Walking to get my son from school wasn't too difficult. The weight wasn't bad but once I picked my son up and had a total of 60lbs to push that became hard when going on a slight inclined road or even going down a steep street which is the street we get to right before we're home. I'm currently pregnant with my 3rd baby so having to push that amount of weight isn't recommended for me. Luckily this will be short lived but man it's not easy especially since I'm in a hot and humid climate even for being in Fall season.Another thing that's a con but not a huge deal breaker is the cup holders for the adults. You get these mesh cup holders. I put a16oz water bottle (as pictured) in it and it's awkward to put in and take out. This also has to do with the angle that the seats are in. My 1 year olds seat is more at a 90\u00b0 angle and that seems easier to get the cup in and out. If the seat is more reclined then I notice it's more difficult to put the cup in/take it out. You have to turn it sideways to put in while holding the mesh cupholder so it fits as the handlebar is in the way.I also noticed that I have to have my arms extended while walking (about 2 feet or so) so that my feet don't hit the lockbar for the wheels. I'm short (4'11\") so this is a slight issue.Pros: I do like that there is a ton of storage since it is a double stroller. My son's backpack and lunchbox fit without any hassel so that's good.Wheels seem to hold up we'll, I mean this is only day once since I've used this but it rolls smoothly and I did have some rough spots to go through on the way/way back from school.The viser has good coverage for my kids which is good since the sun beats down during the time I have to go out to pick him up and walk back.There's a couple of fannypack-like pockets just under the adult cupholders that I like for storying keys and such so I don't need to bring my purse.They also have these mesh side pockets, one on each side of each seat. I don't have a use for them currently but I like that they're there just for the little extra storage aspect.Overall I'm putting up 3 stars as pregnant me gets too exhausted during the last stretch of our walk but I probably would like it more afterwards.",
