                "reviewText": "I did so much research when buying a stroller then settled on the BOB Alterrain Pro, it\u2019s my dream stroller and I absolutely love it, but the one thing I didn\u2019t look at was whether the BOB single jogger snack tray would work for my model\u2026it didn\u2019t and I was devastated. After my purchase I read a rumor online that they were in the process of creating one for the Alterrain because others shared my disappointment, so I kept my dream stroller and held onto hope. Fast forward a year or so they release this snack tray. I was so thrilled but then read the reviews\u2026 SO MANY complaints that it sits too high or is useless. I was devastated all over again but I ordered it anyway, because useless or not, I was desperate. And I\u2019m so glad I did because it\u2019s perfect!!Instillation was quick and easy. I can easily unlatch the snack tray and swing it outwards with one hand while holding my toddler in the other. I\u2019m genuinely confused on the reviews complaining about the height. It does look like it sits too tall, but as soon as I strap my toddler (14mo) in, it looks proportional. She can see over the snack tray, reach the snacks in the holder, reach her sippy, and can easily put them back in the tray when she\u2019s done. It has absolutely upgraded her stroller experience and I highly recommend this product!",

I\u2019m gonna start off by say, I love it. I\u2019ve had it for about 2 months now and I find myself using my Bob more now because of the snack tray. We also have an UB vista and I love it, but my life style is more active, so the Bob is better. The ease of putting it on is 10/10. When I got the all-terrain version, I almost didn\u2019t because I wanted a snak tray and I saw no spot for it. The snack tray comes the attachments for the stroller. When I\u2019m not using the tray, I just leave the attachments on. My only complaints. It\u2019s a little high, but my little can still grab inside. The actual snack container is supposed to come out, I can\u2019t figure out how to get it out to clean, so I\u2019m just wiping it down. But 9.6/10, I recommended. Get it. Your won\u2019t regret",

I'm sad too because it's my understanding that there is no other snack tray that will fit to the BOB Allterrain Pro (because if it weren't the only one, I obviously would not have spent $50 on a plastic snack tray).It sits so high that my little one cannot see what is in it. The whole point of getting this was so that I wouldn't have to stop every minute to hand my son another snack, so that he could feed himself as I continued to walk. Since he can't see anything in the tray, this tray renders itself useless. What a bizarre set up. I wish they made another tray to go with my stroller model. So so so disappointed.Also, another side note of disappointment: sippy cups with handles cannot fit the cup holder. *Sigh*",

                "reviewText": "This was a game changer for us to get my toddler excited to get on the stroller for jogs or walks. Highly recommend - we use it daily during our walks/jogs. My toddler is 22 months and the height was perfectly fine. Maybe a tad bit \u201chigh\u201d but did not at all prevent her grabbing the snacks. She is a petite toddler in the 20th percentile. Definitely recommend!",
