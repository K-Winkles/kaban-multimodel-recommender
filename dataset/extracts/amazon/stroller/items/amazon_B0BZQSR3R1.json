                "reviewText": "Overall, my wife and I like the stroller, but we were disappointed by a couple things.First and foremost, we were taken back to discover that the Baby Trend infant seat we purchased a few years ago for our first child doesn't fit securely in this stroller. It \"fits\" as in it does balance across a couple hard points, but it doesn't click securely into place, like it does on the one-seater Baby Trend stroller that we originally purchased with it. We had assumed that Baby Trend would make an extra effort to ensure the best consumer experience when using their products together; we were wrong. If we had known about this beforehand, we would have given other two-seater stroller brands greater consideration.The other thing that disappointed us is that the rear wheel breaks are plastic. They're not plastic-clad metal. The break locks and axel gears are plastic through and through. I'll be surprised if the stroller lasts more than a year without at least one of them breaking (no pun intended).",
