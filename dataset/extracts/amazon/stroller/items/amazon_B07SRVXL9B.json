                "reviewText": "I ordered this stroller back in February as a GIFT. The baby wasn't born until April. They go to use the stroller for the first time on 6/9, since the baby is big enough now, and the stroller is DEFECTIVE. It does not latch when it is fully opened and is missing screws. Now Spreetail, the seller, is refusing to do anything to remedy this situation. I would choose a company that has more compassion for PARENTS spending their HARD EARNED MONEY on their DEFECTIVE, CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCTS.",
