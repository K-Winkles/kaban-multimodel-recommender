I am curious though about how to properly clean the plastic because I feel like it's getting a little less clear over time.",

                "reviewText": "This seems to be a pretty high quality cover. It's definitely expensive, but the stroller and brand it goes on is quite expensive, so it's to be expected. We got this because our baby didn't like the winds, and especially the cold winter winds in South Dakota. Now, since we got this, we don't feel like we have to wait till it's warm out to take the baby for a walk. We just dress her up and put the cover down.I do wish the straps had some more adjustment to them, so you could get it fitted tighter, but otherwise no complaints at all. They just have velcro on the very ends of the straps, and it should be the whole way so you can get it tighter.",

In order to access your child, you'd have to take the rain cover off - and if it's raining, they would get wet in the process. There are less expensive options that include a zipper. They might not fit as well, but worth the tradeoff for me when thinking about the core functionality.",

                "reviewText": "It took me forever to finally buy this because it\u2019s so freaking expensive for a rain/weather cover but it fits perfectly and It\u2019s well made. I\u2019ve used it tons now and it does the job perfectly. He\u2019s always dry, warm and it\u2019s well ventilated (it never dogs up). I\u2019ve been surprised hailed on and he was covered perfectly from it. I wish the top was also clear so you could see through the top of the stroller to check on him, but honestly you just check through the front it\u2019s not that big of a deal. This thing is also fantastic at keeping him warm when it\u2019s super windy. Blocks it out really well. Also it is so easy to put on and off and stores well in the stroller basket. If you\u2019re going to invest in a BOB you might as well invest in this. I really don\u2019t see a generic one doing as good of a job.",
