                "reviewText": "I did weeks of researching which stroller would be perfect for my infant for our travel. I wanted to have a comfortable and light weight one. I\u2019ve read a lot of great reviews about this stroller so I decided to order it. It has a lot of good features. Lightweight- so easy to carry, and easy to maneuver. The multi-position backrest, the almost flat backrest is my favorite because my baby can sleep comfortably which you can\u2019t find in other strollers. The extra extending canopy is a great help especially when walking during sunny days. The snack tray is a plus. Other lightweight strollers don\u2019t have snack trays. It also came with a rain cover, a cupholder, and a carrying bag. The wheels provide a smooth ride. It is also easy to fold and unfold with just one hand and it is very compact, it doesn\u2019t require large space for storage and it stands on its own when folded. Overall I am so excited to use it not only for traveling but also for everyday use.",

                "reviewText": "We have a 1 year old- he\u2019s a big boy. This was the perfect stroller for travel. Price is reasonable and way cheaper than our original stroller. At 18lbs it\u2019s light enough to whip around the airport and ride up to the gate. We took it on a 2 week road trip and it handles so well. It fit in the trunk but also fits he front seat floor area. It has a bag and a rain cover which is so nice not having to buy extra accessories. Folding is super easy. (Grandpa had to watch a YouTube video how to fold our big cybex stroller lol) It also turns into a bassinet which is so cool and reclines. When our kid is sitting upright it fits my bag above his head so I don\u2019t have to carry everything. The bottom doesn\u2019t hold much but but a small bag but the fact I can throw my bag in the upper area for easy reach was great. Cup holder is a plus. And the snack tray\u2026.. the best part. Not many strollers have it and my guy loves snacks and reaching in the cup holders playing with his sippie cup.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was looking for a lightweight travel stroller but also wanted it to function as an every day stroller. This I think is gonna be it. The only reason I\u2019m giving it a 4 star right now is because I haven\u2019t actually used it yet but I\u2019m excited about finding one with all the features I wanted.It has a cup holder for parent, a large extendable canopy, seat sits all the way up for toddlers or lays all the way down for napping kiddos of all ages, the foot rest that can go up or down depending on the size of your kiddo and leg rest needed, a snack tray that\u2019s removable, a cover that comes out that can cover the legs to help block from wind or cool temps, a decent size basket underneath for storage, all wheel drive on the front, collapses up pretty small that it would fit most overhead compartments on a plane, has extendable handle if you want to wheel it through the airport, nice travel bag, and rain cover. I didn\u2019t ask for much outa my stroller I wanted right? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol \u2026 this covered all the basics for sure and more\u2026 excited to use it and see how well it does at Disney World cause it can occasionally be mass packed house chaos at that place.And not to mention I got all these things at what I feel like is a pretty good price point\u2026 it goes on a good sale every now and then so if you\u2019re thinking about purchasing it put it in your notifications for the price drop.",

We bought this to go on a cruise and couldn't fathom taking our big Graco contraption. Now we're only using this! The bassinet portion is really helpful (if your kid naps or for changing diapers when you don't have anywhere else to change them). I love the handy extra storage hammock it makes up top when the seat is all the way forward. It is light and folds up small (can sometimes take a little jiggling but mostly easy to fold and unfold) the carry case was amazing for the plane and big enough to put other things in too. It is easy to maneuver, love the built in snack and cup tray on the front and so many other things. It's made so thoughtfully and so far we've been loving it.",

We used it on a Disney cruise and didn\u2019t have an issue navigating the halls or entering the state room. This stroller has a lot of convenient features including the ability to lay flat, sunshade, cup holder, and snack tray. It collapses pretty quickly. It also has a carrying bag and a rain cover. The only cons I have: the fabric feels cheap (compared to Nuna) and the storage basket is rather small. If you\u2019re trying to save money, I\u2019d skip the Nuna and get this mompush instead. Save the $$",

I like some of the features such as an almost full recline so my daughter can nap better in the stroller. I wanted something lightweight as well which this stroller has both features but for price, everything is so cheap feeling and the stroller isn\u2019t sturdy at all compared to my powerglyde.Pros: lightweight, folds up small for storage, full reclineCons: cheaply made, no peek-a-boo window as advertised (it\u2019s even in my instruction manual), bassinet feature is terrible, super small storage underneath, \u201cadjustable\u201d door foot rest is either all the way up or all the way down, I\u2019m 5\u201d0 and think the handle bar is low for me so tall people beware, hard to fold up (have to slide a button and squeeze another in at the same time)Overall, if it was under $100 I would say it\u2019s not bad but for the price, it\u2019s extremely cheaply made. I wish I kept my Jeep powerglyde stroller",

It folds up into a very compact package that could easily fit in any trunk with space to spare. The included rain guard is an awesome bonus.My only complaint is the locking mechanism on the handle. It feels pretty cheap and can be unresponsive at times, mine wore in a little after several weeks of use so hopefully it will continue to improve.",
