I'm satisfied with my purchase and the features it offers to make outings with my child more practical and comfortable.However, I'd like to express a concern. I'm using the original adapter that came with the stroller to attach the Cloud Z2 car seat from the same brand. Nevertheless, I've noticed that the safety lock on the adapter seems to easily come undone and does so frequently.A worrisome situation occurred recently when I was attempting to secure the Cloud Z2 car seat with my child inside. The adapter completely detached, which left me quite frightened and concerned about the product's safety.I have reached out to Cybex's support team three times, but I have not received any response thus far. I'm sharing this experience to ensure that this safety issue is properly addressed and that others are also aware of this potential concern.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after lots of researching. See, I have a baby that demands the following:1) Reversible / parent facing seat2) Really upright seat (like 90 degrees upright)3) One hand recline. He\u2019s a large baby (98 percentile) so most of the strap-based incline systems are too hard to use with him4) Adjustable footrest (seriously he likes to be 90 degrees upright but with knees bent\u2026and this kid is only 8 months old\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)5) Light weight stroller (ok this is more for me)6) Good suspension / wheels (we live in a place that\u2019s near a lot of cobblestones)It\u2019s really hard to find a mix of all of these in a single package, and in the end we were down to this, the Mios and the Nuna Triv Next.The Mios unfortunately was heavier, while the Triv Next was fairly wide and a bit bulky. We were sold on the Cybex for the easy-to-reverse seat option\u2014it\u2019s been great for mall trips where baby changes his mind on what he wants to see. But bare in mind he doesn\u2019t have object permanence yet, so probably it\u2019ll be less of a benefit to toddlers that don\u2019t care about the reversible seat part.The cons of this stroller are:- It\u2019s really narrow. Like I don\u2019t know how much longer baby can fit it\u2019s so narrow. On the plus side it goes through doors really well.- The seat is shallow- Unlike the European version the US/CA version only has 2 recline modes: really upright and almost flat. It\u2019s good enough for us because this baby hates lounging at an angle and wants to be either 90 degrees or 180 degrees\u2026but I know most other kids prefer somewhere in between.- It\u2019s fairly rickety because it\u2019s trying to be a travel stroller, but at the same time it\u2019s not THAT light (at 18 lbs it\u2019s the same as my BabyJogger City Mini, which cost only like 40% of the price and is far sturdier).- The canopy has no peekaboo and is not really deep (though it\u2019s pretty middle of pack for a travel strollers)- Small basket (again this is more of a travel stroller thing)If you don\u2019t care about the reversible seat and want a travel stroller with good wheels I would probably go for the Uppababy Minu. If you care about the reversible seat and ok with the larger size the Nuna Triv would be better. If you don\u2019t care about reversible seat or upright seat for the same price just get the Babyzen YoYo.",

                "reviewText": "I love that this stroller is light but my son is 13 months and he\u2019s always leaning to the side to want to touch the ground. The stroller tilts to the side with him. It\u2019s not sturdy enough. If u turn to fast the stroller is gonna fall to the side. I\u2019m so mad I have to purchase a sturdy stroller now. I didn\u2019t know this would happen when he was born.",
