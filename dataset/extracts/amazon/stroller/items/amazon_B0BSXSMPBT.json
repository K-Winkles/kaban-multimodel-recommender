On your stroller, simply slide the main seat attachment up to create extra space and flip out the front seat attachment to click your second seat into place. Two children can now ride at once.

The seat easily clicks onto the attachments in both parent- and forward-facing modes, giving you multiple riding con\ufb01gurations. The canopy can be adjusted to one of three heights as your child grows. The canopy shields your precious cargo from sun, wind and rain, while the peek-a-boo window allows you to keep an eye on your baby at all times. And the canopy can be adjusted to one of 3 heights to accommodate your growing child. As your family grows, so can your stroller! The seat can recline into 3 different positions with an easy one-handed tilt, while the footrest can be adjusted to any one of 6 positions. The toddler seat fits children up to 55 lb and 43 in. The seat comes with a 5-point harness and a detachable bumper bar, making it a breeze to get your child in and out of the seat. Compatible with the Evenflo Stroller Child Snack Tray with Snack Cup (sold separately). Compatible with the Pivot Xpand Travel System and Pivot Xpand Standalone Stroller. It\u2019s been 100 years and Evenflo continues to push the boundaries in baby and children\u2019s gear design and innovation.

                "reviewText": "My family absolutely loves this EvenFlo Pivot Xpand modular stroller! We actually pre-ordered the stroller combo with the infant car seat and base and the additional travel seat. The combo worked great because our newborn used the infant seat and our 3 year old used the travel seat. We knew in a couple of years we would need to purchase an additional travel seat because at a certain age infants begin to HATE their infant seats. And thats why we made this purchase! By the way, our 3 year old is turning 6 in a couple months and she still FITS!! She is skinny and has an average growth chart.This modular stroller system is THE best system out there! EvenFlo is careful to warn that, the seats should not carry more than 50lbs each. We have had this stroller system for nearly 3 years now and we are happy to say that this stroller is a work horse! Even despite those warnings (probably only to reduce liability), we pull our weekly grocery run in our stroller, transport potted plants, stack up on the weekend BBQ supplies, heavy coolers, and much more! The ability to pick and choose how you want to set up the seats is definitely one of the best features of this system. We've recommended this system to all of our friends...Pros:- Highly adjustable- Leg portion has three adjustable settings- Comes with matching shaded canopy with a flap for cooling- Seat can be mounted front or back on the stroller- Seat can be mounted on the top or bottom post on the stroller- Reclines in three positions- Can be used as seat or bassinet- Adjustable Seat restraints- Foot area has rubberized material making it easy to wipe clean.Cons:- Material cannot be removed for machine washing- Must hand wash and spot clean- Black bar serves no significant purpose- Black bar should've been designed as a small table or cup holder",

It doesnt come with a whole bunch of accessories but it works and it's just as advertised in the videos. We bought an extra car seat for it as an add on and it can be used multiple ways. Had it for a few months now so this review is after a lot of use. Definitely durable and use it almost daily.",

                "reviewText": "Adding this second seat was the icing on the cake! I love that I don\u2019t have to restrict the kids from which seat to sit in since the seats are identical in appearance and weight limit! I love being able to take out walking with everyone able to see the work or mama or each other and upon tiring themselves out that they can both get a nap! Seriously! Getting my 3 year old to nap is nearly impossible but she will sleep an hour or more in this stroller! I was actually really glad that the original package only came with one toddler seat because I didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d need the second one but here we are, after using the car seat as a travel system double stroller for a full year my now 13 and 37 month olds are both still asking for a daily stroller ride in their evenflo xpand NOW with two toddler seats!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this second seat to go with our newly purchased Evenflo Pivot Xpand for our new baby coming. I love that there\u2019s an option to buy the second seat, so when baby grows out of the infant car seat, you can snap this one in its place and have a functioning double stroller. My oldest two boys tested this out when we went on a walk the other day. They loved being in it, and they actually complained when we had to put it away. My only recommendation is if Evenflo would make the seat height a little further up for more headroom for older toddlers.",
