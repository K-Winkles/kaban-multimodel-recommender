                "reviewText": "It is so worth the money, and I am a cheapskate. My husband is 6\u20193\u201d and I am 5\u20193\u201d. The handle bars are so easy to adjust when we take turns pushing the kids. We hardly ever use the pull-lever because the push-bar is so easy. But the pull-lever adjusts high for my tall husband.We love the food tray for the kids. It clicks in kind of weird but you get used to it. I love how it can switch between the wagon or on the handles if you need it out of the way.So much storage! We don\u2019t even pack a diaper bag.I have fit two 18-month olds and a 4 year old in here. The kids seemed comfortable. Most the time we have 2 kids and all their crap.It\u2019s nice having the buckles for the really wiggly kid. But I don\u2019t usually need to use it because the sides are so high up that the kids can\u2019t really get out without help, so I feel like they are safe.The canopy is kind of hard to pop up. It seems like the cheapest part of it all. It doesn\u2019t click in as easily as the rest of it does. But it does work once you can click it in, and it\u2019s nice that it is stored on the stroller so you always have it with you. It seems waterproof? I\u2019ve used it for shade and a rain cover.The brakes work great, even parked on inclines. Super easy to click with your feet. But they are so powerful, that to click the break off requires a little oomph. I partially unlocked it one time and it made a crazy sound when we pushed it. Fixed it by just in clicking it all the way. So the break is strong.The wheels are that strong foam material, so there\u2019s no worries of popping a tire. And the wheels are large so it can roll up a curb with very little jostling for my kids. It rides smooth. I was surprised how easy it was to maneuver, especially for how long it is. It does alright offroading when you have to cross over grass or whatever.It collapses and locks in so it will stay collapsed. It\u2019s easy to unlock it and set it up. Like, unclick the red lever, push the sides apart, and push down the center. It snaps into place. Boom, you\u2019re ready. It folds up the front and back collapsed to each other so it\u2019s the same height. It\u2019s not super small, but it\u2019s decently compact.It\u2019s been easy to wipe up messes from kids.I\u2019ve used it about two dozen times now these past couple of months. We\u2019ve taken it on vacation, to amusement parks, around the neighborhood, parks, on dirt, grass, in wind, in rain, in sunny heat, etc. I absolutely love this wagon. It is the best.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I'm updating my original review. The company sent me a new wagon to try out, and I have to say, this wagon works much better! The pull handle extends all the way and is plenty long for me (5'11\") and my husband (6'4\"). I think the first one was stuck to a shorter length, but this handle works great. The canopy also pops in and stays in place. Our first walk outside it started raining on us. The kids were totally dry and the canopy seemed to repel water fairly easy. If it's absolutely storming, you will get wet, just fyi. But if you get caught in the rain, this can definitely help while getting to shelter.I LOVE how deep the wagon is. My 1 year old is a climber and loves to try to escape. This deep wagon straps her in and keeps her inside without a chance that she can lean over the edges and somehow escape. (She's Houdini reincarnated, I promise.) She can still see out and be engaged in our activities, but she isn't making any escape plans in this. 5 point padded harness is a plus!I put my 1 year old and my 4 year old in the wagon and they fit together great. My 4 year old is the size of a 7 years old, so there really is plenty of space. I've also put in my 1 year old with my 3 month old (just laying her down flat) and it still worked great. Nice and deep to keep everyone inside and plenty of leg/sitting space.Also, after testing about 5 other wagons/double strollers, this wagon definitely has the most storage space. It's easy to think, \"I've got a wagon, so plenty of room to throw in everything.\" You'd be surprised how easy it is to run out of space. This wagon, however, has a cup/water bottle holder, pockets, a bag, and a few hidden zippered pouches. All very useful and needed when out and about. There are definitely places to keep things that you don't want your kids to be able to grab while riding along.The snack tray being outside of the wagon is still a little weird to me, BUT I do think this is the best value. I was shocked at how expensive wagons are, and I do feel like this stands up to all of them. Nice deep sitting area, two tall handles to push or pull, more than normal storage, and smooth ride. For the price, I don't think this can be beat!",

                "reviewText": "After 4 kids you learn what does and doesn't work. I've had umbrella stroller, jogging stroller, double jogging stroller.... Never enough room for storage and takes up way to much cargo space. I can pop the wheels and rear axle off in seconds and slide this bad boy in the floor under the baby's carseat behind the driver seat in my van instead of using up all my trunk space. Pushes easily on any terrain I've had it on (gravel, grass, pavement), turns on a dime, and looks classy. The sun shade is simple to put on and remove but only really works if the sun is directly overhead, I just keep a muslin swaddle blanket to hang from whatever side the sun is shining in. The pockets and built in bag are perfect for storing whatever you need. My baby loves it (6 months), I can buckle her in to sit or she can lay down and nap plus there is room for my 5 year old if he gets tired. I've used it many times as a pack and play of sorts when we are out and about. This is one of my #1 baby products now, I only wish I had one before baby #4!",
