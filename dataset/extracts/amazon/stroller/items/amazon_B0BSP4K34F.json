                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Replacing my Chicco Bravo with this!",
                "reviewText": "Been struggling along with the Chicco Bravo stroller for 10 months now. Got strong and figured whatever, I guess I'll just deal with it at this point and eventually I'll get an umbrella stroller. It's been in the back of my mind frequently that I do eventually need to get something lighter, something that doesn't make me dread putting the stroller in the car and lug it in and out of places.Then we took a flight with the Bravo and the airline lost the canopy somehow?!?!! I took it as a sign. Time to find a new stroller ASAP so I could get back on my daily walks this summer with my daughter!!I spent so many hours trying to pick the right stroller. This is such a hard thing to search for online. I went to a local Buybuybaby but their selection was a lot of $500+ strollers and I did not want to spend that much money. I also didn't want something super cheap feeling either, since I've been used to the quality of the Bravo, which is very sturdy. Goal was to find something for $200 or less, preferably closer to $100.I was looking for 1. Lightweight and small 2. Quality feel and able to push in the grass 3. Decent sized canopy, basket and tray/storage for baby and parent.I was surprised by the quality when I first opened the box. Here are my initial reactions - maybe if I can remember I will update again after using it for a few months.-Sturdy and more solid than I expected for price. Like the colors too.-Super quick and easy set up.-Surprised by and like the design of the 5 point harness. No connecting pieces like my Chicco Bravo. Set in place to connect as 5 regularly, or if you want to switch it to 3 point seems easy to do that. Lots of height and width adjustment appears to be available too.-Snack tray super easy to add or remove.-Cup holder was disappointing. Seems pretty flimsy but we'll see how it works. First time I folded up stroller it fell right off \ud83d\ude11.-Love how easy it is to adjust the leg rest, looks like that will work well.-Love the canopy coverage and the peekaboo window at first glance, although we'll see how it actually performs when we put it to use on a sunny day.-Wheels looks sturdy, but upon first push felt a tad wobbly. To be expected for a lightweight stroller though. It will certainly be an adjustment for me going from the almost all-terrain Bravo.-Wish handle bar was adjustable. Feels slightly high for me (5' 4\") but I'm sure I'll get used to it.-Parent storage pocket looks perfect for keys and phone and possibly small wallet.-Rear brake felt really tight but I was trying to push it without shoes on at first. Seems like it will hold well, which is good.-Basket is small but that's to be expected with a lightweight stroller. Seems bigger than other lightweight strollers I saw in stores. But cannot fit my itsy bitsy backpack diaper bag.-I haven't tried it yet, but I like that this is compatible with the Chicco KeyFit30 carseat. However, I don't like how the straps to connect the carseat seem like they will tend to flip out of their designated pockets and hang out/constantly need to be packed back into the pockets. Time will tell if this becomes a nuisance or not.-Best of all, the weight and size. It's lightweight, folds up so easily, is compact when folded, has a carrying handle and is just all around what I need to get out and about more frequently with an almost 1 year old!!",

                "reviewText": "Wow, this is surprisingly awesome. I bought this for the lightweight, small size to push my 40lb, 40in tall preschooler. Go ahead and judge me, I don't care, I'm too happy about how smoothly our latest hospital visit was due to this new stroller. I pulled it out of my trunk and opened it in seconds. Pushed it across the long@ss parking lot, up the neverending hill to the last doors of our major hospital where my son has his visits, and through the busy halls with ease. Into the elevator without any issues and ohmygod the SWIVEL to turn my son forward facing without bumping any walls or rolling the thing was incredible and quick- a family of 3 entered directly behind us and wasn't disturbed in the least. In the past, corners were basically an Olympic event with strollers and I'd never attempted to turn my son around in the elevator. I wish I had bought this sooner! I'm using this for everything now.I wish I had taken a photo of my son in the stroller. He was in a puffy jacket and had a throw blanket on his lap, placed there before I put the tray on. He's old enough I didn't use the belt and the tray was enough to keep him secured as we moved.This is extremely light weight and folds down to an incredible size. It could probably fit behind my passenger seat on the floor in front of my son's car seat if absolutely necessary. My other 2 strollers took up most/my entire Subaru Impreza's trunk space whereas this one takes up about 1/3 of the space. It's also lightweight enough that I can lift it with one hand when closed. This stroller also features the one handed close feature and can hold infant seats although I don't need that at this moment. It has a shoulder strap and can be carried like an oversized messenger bag.The size of the stroller when open is SO much smaller than either of my Graco easy fold strollers (jogger and 4 wheeled that can be used with click connect system). It's also incredibly easy to maneuver. Like, wow it's SO smooth even with whatever material the wheels are made of (not rubber but I'm ok with the compromise now that I've used it). The basket is shallow but still fits the plastic rain cover I keep with us at all times and a blanket can be draped over the top instead of folded in the basket for later if needed.Our diaper bag is a backpack with stroller straps but I would definitely recommend NOT hanging the diaper bag on this stroller - it's just too light weight without a kiddo in it and will tip right over. I think I'd forget that fact if I did attach the bag just to have the stroller fall rafter letting my kid out. Nobody needs that mess; I'll continue to wear the bag.HIGHLY recommend to everyone but especially those who have to travel in busy/populated areas. I don't plan on using this at the amusement park but definitely for all hospital and mall visits, possibly the zoo.Edit 7/23- took this to an amusement park against my better judgement. I know, I know! But it's just so awesome I had to try... Oh well, lesson learned! While it did it's job on the concrete and firm paths, any area that had gravel fill (a thick layer of teensy rocks) really put me to the test and made me nervous (almost got stuck once or twice). My kid is old enough to understand \"sit back\" so his weight could be distributed more to the rear tires but I'm honestly not taking this again after this experience. I still love the stroller for everything else but I wouldn't recommend this anywhere that isn't mostly smooth.Edit 9/17/23Easy for bigger kids to use. This summer this stroller has been pushed by a 9yo, a 10yo, and an 11yo on separate occasions. Sometimes with my son, other times with a toddler. Overall, easy to maneuver and no frustrations.Edited to add photos:1- takes up 1/4 of my trunk. I have room for groceries!2- while it does fit behind my passenger seat, the seat had to be moved up slightly and my son wouldn't fit in his Chicco booster with the stroller in the foot space. However, if I needed to move the stroller from my trunk, obviously it would fit elsewhere easily. Also, I have a small sedan so larger vehicles would be more accommodating.3- This stroller is in the front of my Graco click connect strollers (traditional on left, jogger on right). It's obvious how this stroller is so much more compact than either of those.4- I was able to keep a cup of lemonade in the pocket. Why is this important? The cupholder on the tray is basically worthless for any cup that isn't toddler sized and the cupholder that can be attached to the stroller is MIA. This was a nice compromise BUT I was able to push the stroller one handed so really, this is only necessary if you need both hands (or a place to keep your cup while taking your LO to the restroom).",

                "reviewTitle": "Fantastic stroller - lots of great features and is perfect for travel and everyday use!",
                "reviewText": "I waited 2 months to write this review so I could thoroughly test out this stroller. I initially purchased it for travel as I was looking for something more compact and lighter than my standard stroller, but am now also exlcusively using it for my everyday walks. I recently took a couple of cross-country flights solo with my 12 month old, and this stroller was was a godsend for my trip. Here's why:I was able to quickly fold the stroller down with one hand while holding the baby in my other arm. The stroller itself isn't heavy, and the added shoulder strap makes it easier to carry while keeping your hands free. The basket isn't the biggest but for a compact stroller, it is still very generous (I managed to shove the diaper bag in there with no issues). Smooth one-hand manoeuverability! I chose this one over the popular Summer umbrella stroller because being able to steer the stroller with one hand while holding other bags in a busy airport is vital! Brake is activated with one foot.The canopy is large and opens up to provide very good shade. I particularly love the adjustable footrest - much better than other strollers where the kid's legs are just hanging off the seat. The mobile holder is a nice touch. There's a little envelope pocket behind the canopy, which can perfectly and discreetly hold smaller items like a wallet, keys, etc. There is also a sneaky little drink pocket nestled next to baby's seat as well, perfect to hold a sippy cup, baby bottle, etc.The stroller works a charm on sidewalks, and even slightly gravelly terrain, as the front wheels have suspensions so the ride isn't as bumpy. My baby seems to enjoy this stroller more than his original one, and it looks to be holding up well to our daily use. The wheels haven't given us any issues so far (no jamming as yet), and have been running smoothly. In terms of materials, the fabric is durable and cleans easily (I've spot cleaned it a couple of times already).A few points to consider (but not enough to warrant taking stars off):-The beverage holder isn't the most sturdy, but works fine for a standard bottle - there's literally a sign on it that indicates it isn't suitable for coffee cups so it's a bit silly for people to complain about how their cups are falling out.- I do wish the seat would recline more to facilitate more comfortable naps. My little one has napped in it a couple of time regardless, and he seemed fine.- The handlebar is not adjustable. My husband and I are tall (5'9\" - 5'11\") so the height of the handlebar is ideal for us, but I can imagine that for shorter adults, it may not be the most comfortable to manouever.- The stroller is quite compact when folded but perhaps not small enough to fit in the overhead baggage compartment on a plane (I gate-checked it instead).- I have not tested out the feature for adding an infant car seat, so cannot comment on that.All in all, this stroller was definitely one of my top baby purchases! Lots of lovely features, you're getting a lot more than what you're paying for in my opinion! It's a better-equipped alternative to an umbrella stroller. Ideal for travel and casual everyday use! Hopefully it lasts me the next couple of years until my little one outgrows it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I just preface this review by telling you that I travelled alone by plane with my 2 year old daughter. This stroller is so seamless and easy to use that it actually made my trip with her more enjoyable. Because it folds up so easily with ONE hand, I was able to juggle her, bags and the stroller. It\u2019s very light and the over shoulder strap is very handy. It has just enough storage: cup holder for you, pouch beside the handle bar, under seat shelf storage. Easy one hand handling. I spent HOURS a day walking the side walks and streets of Victoria, BC without any issues. The wheels are sturdy enough. The table for the child is just the right size for a sippy cup and a few crackers. The sun visor comes down surprisingly low! It did rain while we were here so her legs got very wet but I suppose you could buy a stroller cover. This is definitely worth it\u2019s value. My daughter fit in it perfectly. The folded unit fits almost anywhere, including a small closet or under a chair. The cup holder on the handle bar is a bit flimsy so I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting hot beverages there but it\u2019s perfect for a water bottle or something.Highly recommend.",

Love that the canopy goes so far down for extra shade from the sun. The recline is nice as well for naps... could go down a little further but it did the trick. The basket under is fairly spacious and the pocket behind the seat is nice too. We liked it so much we decided to just use it as our everyday stroller for the past 6+ months and it's held up nicely. Love that it's lightweight and not too bulky.",
