The idea of something like this is great, but in practices it gets in the way when you are walking and doesn\u2019t leave enough space above for a child to sit without hitting the handle. Decided to return",

This causes it to slide under the basket, and dips low so it\u2019s not sturdy or level at all. Plus how secure can Velcro even be? Not happy at all. Going straight to the Goodwill for someone else to use with some other stroller.",

Maneuvering and taking turns are also smooth. No problem. The only challenge i experienced is pushing it from behind. There's no enough space to walk behind it and hits my feet a couple of times. I ended up pushing my stroller from the side. Might buy a handle extension on my stroller so i can push it comfortably next time i use it.",
