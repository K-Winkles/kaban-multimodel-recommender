                "reviewText": "After watching the video on the order page I was able to put this stroller together in 10 minutes. It\u2019s super duper easy and even the instructions manual is clear by illustrations. I love the simplicity of this stroller! It goes a long way!!Number one thing that impressed me about this stroller is the seat material! Most strollers you get nowadays are not cotton like this one and seem to get hot! Quilted seat fabric on this stroller is my absolute favorite!This stroller also seems to be wider than most I\u2019ve seen. My almost three year old is super comfortable, smiling during the ride, with room to spare. My one year old fell asleep within 5 minutes.The back above head is wide mash so there\u2019s plenty of circulation and the child is visible, along with the extra pocket window that is on top of canopy.The storage area is sufficient and larger than most travel strollers.The 5 point harness is simple to use. I am able to keep side straps together and just click each side into the strap that is in between the legs.The handle is cushioned vegan leather. It is not height adjustable. This was going to be my negative in the review, however I am 5\u20199\u201d and it is a very comfortable height for me.There is a brake on each side of the back wheels. They\u2019re a little stuff currently but I figure they\u2019ll loosen up over time.I also love the adjustable leg rest so much! Originally I thought it\u2019s just foldable for storage, but no! It retracts for when the baby is sleeping or it can be put down for a seating position for the child to rest feet on the actual leg rest for feet, underneath.The snack tray clicks in and out easily. It\u2019s easy to clean/wash.The tires are plastic and can be put on and off easily if need be, for storage. While putting them on I did notice some substance leak out that makes them a very smooth ride.The cup holder clicks in easily.The whole stroller is super lightweight and seems sturdy, well made.I don\u2019t have a little tiny baby so I have not tested the car seat option, however the whole setup I have seen and dealt with makes me think it would be very simple as well. Again, the video on the product page is extremely helpful and I recommend watching it.I hope you find this review helpful.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is nice, easy to assemble, and works well in a very basic way. In my opinion it\u2019s definitely a little overpriced for what you\u2019re getting, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing fancy about it! I\u2019m giving 4 stars because it\u2019s a nice basic stroller, but pricey for not getting any extra benefits.Pros:-Easy to assemble-Seems like quality material that will last a long time-Easy to fold and storeCons:- The wheels are smaller than average with no padding, so they don\u2019t absorb shock very well over rocks and bumps.-There\u2019s only a tiny little cup holder that you can attach, and no other storage area on top for a phone or other quick convenience (there\u2019s a little pocket on the back, but I personally like my stuff on top where I can see it). Of course theres the regular tote on the bottom for bag storage and stuff, but most strollers have that.-The top vent area to see baby is very small, and doesn\u2019t have anything to keep it open so it\u2019s constantly flapping closed (like there\u2019s no strap or Velcro that keeps it open while walking so you can have a constant view of baby).-Pricier than other basic strollers",

                "reviewText": "The Contours Quick Elite Lightweight Compact Fold Travel Baby Stroller offers convenience and portability for parents on the go. Its lightweight design and compact fold make it easy to maneuver and store, perfect for travel. The stroller is compatible with infant car seats, providing versatility for parents with young babies. The multi-position seat recline and sun canopy offer comfort and protection for the child. Additionally, the 5-point safety harness ensures security during rides. However, I found that the stroller lacks durability and feels flimsy at times. The wheels could be sturdier, especially when navigating rough terrain. While it offers convenience, improvements in overall build quality would make it a more reliable option.",

Since my child is passed the infant stage, I was not able to test car seat compatibility.PROS:- Affordable, but not the cheapest on the market- Super lightweight (14.2 pounds!)- One-hand fold, in case your other hand is busy holding your toddler- Adjustable seat recline with multiple positions for your child to sit up, lay back, or lie down for a quick nap- Travel-friendly and easy to load up on the carCONS:- Not that stylish to other strollers on the market- Won\u2019t be the most comfortable for your toddler",
