                "reviewText": "This stroller is awesome! We got it for an international trip coming up and we might want it to replace our regular stroller. Baby can't give a review but it looks more comfortable especially with the foot rest that can be elevated. The material is good and sturdy. It isn't too slippery like our other stroller so he isn't going to slide all over the place and somehow our of the seat. The straps are sturdy. I really like how it has a big buckle and a wide strap for the bottom strap that goes between the legs. The recline is near flat almost like laying in a recliner couch/chair. I wish that the canopy was a little bigger for more sun protection but it will do. This is the first time that baby has fallen asleep in a stroller without crying and fussing. He looks so relaxed!It goes over bumps and rough terrain easily but it can be a bumpy ride. Smaller wheels means less shock absorption. The stroller is pretty light so it is easy to tilt and go over larger bumps. It handles really well and can be steered with one hand (coffee in the other hand).It is a little more complicated to fold. It is rather difficult to fold and unfold with one hand but two hands is easy! It doesn't stay folded up unless you hold it by the carrier strap in the middle. It comes with a carrying bag, too! It is pretty small so it doesn't take up much space at all in the car and hopefully on an airplane, too.",

                "reviewText": "Super compact fold, folds to size of a briefcase and easily fits in overhead bin of plane !! The plane staff were skeptical and surprised when we folded it in front of them (they were trying to make us gate check it). I even opened it on the plane on the way out and it was skinny enough to go in the aisle! This was a game changer for travel. Also leans back almost fully flat so baby can sleep. My 1 year old napped comfortably for hours at a time in this.The only complaint I have is the fold mechanism is pretty clunky...not a one hand fold like our full size cybex. Kind of annoying and holds you up at the plane. But other than that it's PERFECT for travel and has made all the difference! Hubby and I don't know how we went without it (this was our 4th trip with baby and our first time using this stroller). Price point is not bad, I got it on sale for $230...not cheap but better than the $500 competitor than doesn't even lie flat. 100% recommend",

                "reviewText": "I bought this stroller for my currently 7 months old baby. We have the Chicco Bravo, and even though we love it because it's big and comfy, it takes up the entire trunk in our suv, it\u2019s heavy, bulky and won\u2019t fit in a plane cabin. I researched for a while and decided to give the baby jogger a try. An easy to fold, small to bring in cabin and sturdy stroller were a must since we plan on traveling by plane very often, plus we also want it for everyday use. Pros: FOOTREST! Our big full size stroller doesn\u2019t have this, and it\u2019s a must for taking naps. It\u2019s easy to fold, and folds very small which is impressive. It came fully assembled and just had to put in the wheels which took me less than 30 seconds. I like the almost flat recline back rest. When pushing, it feels very lightweight compared to my big stroller. People have complained about the harness, but all the pieces came together and don\u2019t detach easily so that\u2019s fast too. Cons: basket is VERY small, but it\u2019s a travel stroller so that\u2019s understandable. On our big stroller we have a large basket where we can fit 2 backpacks but I believe this one can only hold a small purse. The canopy could be larger because the sun hits directly on baby\u2019s chest.I\u2019ll be using it for a couple months before we travel and I\u2019ll edit the review if necessary.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this worked well for us and is much more compact than our old stroller. The folding was nice and relatively easy to carry, while it is light it does get heavy after a while. You do need two hands to fold up and close securely. The cargo carrier suited us and carried a small backpack and multiple packable coats. Three things I disliked, 1. it feels a bit flimsy, especially when going over bumpy roads it felt like it would fold up/bend the frame when trying to go over a bump. 2. The bag carrier while a great idea the one that comes with it is not great. I will be looking for another that has backpack straps and ideally wouldn\u2019t need two people to get the stroller in the bag. 3. Lastly, if you have anything hanging on the back handle the stroller will tip over as soon as a kid leaves seat. Small issues vs using a bigger stroller in the small spaces in Europe or no stiller at all.",

The one hand folding requires some getting used to and is not as easy as they show it on video but unfolding it is a breeze. I did not like that it does not stand on it's own while folded - resulted in my baby jogger getting some scratches when it hits the floor.",
