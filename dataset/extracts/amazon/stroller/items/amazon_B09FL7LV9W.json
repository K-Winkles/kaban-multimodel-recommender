                "reviewText": "Just got this stroller and am already in love! I wanted a stroller that is easy to maneuver and also will grow with our baby. While I haven\u2019t had this baby yet, I have used many strollers in the past for my twins so am comparing this to other strollers I have used. First, it was incredibly easy to put together, even by myself, large and pregnant. It pushes so smoothly with 360 degree front wheels. Has a very large basket underneath for storage. Very easy to convert from infant car seat to bassinet to toddler seat modes. I bought the separate infant car seat adapter and my Chicco car seat locks in perfectly. After removing the car seat, the frame folds down effortlessly. The bassinet is very sturdy and I didn\u2019t realize it came with a removable cover (cover is on in the photos) which will be perfect for walks in the winter. It even came with a clear waterproof stroller cover for walks in the rain! The cup holder does fit a 40 oz Stanley but feels a little too heavy so will probably need to get a smaller Stanley or see if there is a more intense cup holder that can be added. Can\u2019t wait to go for many strolls!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this stroller for our 2.5yo for our upcoming trip to Disney World. We wanted something compact to maneuver through crowds but large enough for her to sit comfortably.PROS:The stroller is beautiful and the color is a while vibe. Well made with quality materials. LOVE how large the canopy is, even with the seat reclined! Easy to maneuver in tight spaces (with the front wheels unlocked). Large storage basket. One hand fold. Flat fold, without seat attached.CONS:Not the best for tall/larger toddlers. Our girl's head is literally IN the canopy. If we didn't absolutely need a stroller for our trip, I'd return for this reason. If your LO is in the 70thpercentile+ keep looking! Folding with seat attached is bulky, not a deal breaker for us because it still fits in our SUV with room to spare. 2 hands required to open and a bit awkward, this will probably become easier over time. Not as comfortable for shorter people... my husband loves the handle bar height, he's 6'3. I wish the handle was adjustable because at 5'1 the bar is level with my chest. YES, I could've purchased the other model for $100 more but our intentions were to find a decent stroller under $200 for travel and this fit that bill!Overall, my LO doesn't seem to mind her lack of headspace and never wants to get out of the stroller so I'd say it's a winner! We'll see if she still loves it after our trip.Recommended accessories: clip on fan, stroller hooks, snack cup, silicone toy straps (for those toddlers that love to throw), stroller side sling, phone mount.",

                "reviewText": "As a mom, sometimes you have to weigh a million factors before making a choice, strollers, car seats, the list is endless and it\u2019s really hard to jump and pick one over the millions of others you\u2019ve looked at! Trust me when I say that for the price this is the most convertible and convenient stroller, you get the features of the bassinet up until 22.6 kilograms (49.8 pounds roughly) which is actually quite heavy, most kids will want to be running around by the time they outgrow it. Not to mention the parent facing feature is so helpful for doctor\u2019s appointments where I would more prefer my child face me versus out towards strangers! It\u2019s not as compact as others similarly designed but you pop the seat off and the base slides compact and then you can just stack one on the other in a trunk to transport it wherever. Just because it\u2019s not suitcase size doesn\u2019t actually hurt my review on it, it still collapses down small enough it\u2019s not a huge waste of space. The wheels are also a deal breaker other strollers suck as soon as you hit weird surfaces but these have the 360 degree turn feature so unless you are in a couple inches of mud, sleet, or snow it should hold up great. And if you don\u2019t want the 360 degree turn feature at the moment you just slide the ring around each foot base and it locks into place just as easily as it can pop into 360 mode if you\u2019d like to. All around I love this stroller much more than anything else I\u2019ve ever had, assembly was a little difficult (only popping the canopy into place the rest of it fit snug and I had no issue getting it together by myself!) and the color came out beautiful I picked the sage and I am NOT disappointed with the color. All around 10/10 for what I was looking for, and for less than 200$ it\u2019s my number one pick for any moms on a budget who want something convertible and long-lasting from newborn to toddler stage.",
