And we thought: \"Why not both?\" Enter the Century\u00ae Stroll On\u2122 4-Wheel Lightweight Stroller, our \"On-the-Go Pro\". With a sleek design, this ultra-lightweight stroller features a compact, self-standing fold (oh, you'll thank us later), and is compatible with all Century\u00ae Carry On\u2122 Infant Car Seats, so you can create a super-lightweight travel system. A large, adjustable canopy has a peekaboo (we see you!) window for check-ins with your silly little goose as you explore the great big world. But the thing we're most proud of?

                "reviewText": "Purchased the 4 wheel single stroller for our trip to Orlando with our almost 2 year old. We have a cheap umbrella stroller but the wheels get stuck going over the tiniest bumps in the road, so i spent hours searching for a great travel stroller, determined to find the best one that isn't stupid expensive (was expecting to pay a bit more than what I paid for this though, so glad we didn't have to). This was AMAZING! Easy to push, folds up nicely and easily, light weight, love the snack and cup tray (super easy to remove and put back, which we did alot for diaper changes), easy to recline (doesnt go all the way back, but goes far and she napped well in it), sunshade was long enough she didn't once cry about sun in face, dried quickly (yes, it poured on us one of the days), spacious under storage WITHOUT the strap in the middle, so you can actually use it, and she has room to grow in it! I mean...I love this stroller, and it is definitely replacing the stroller we were using for daily use. The only con I have with it is that it'd be great if the parent cup holder and tray was a little deeper..drinks fit in it, but slushed around alot while pushing and when water bottles got closer to empty they bobbled around a lot...for the tray, it'd be nice to be able to store my phone in it (I plan to buy something separate to hold my phone). However, most strollers don't even come with the parent cup holder/tray. Even so, it wouldn't deter me from recommending this stroller one bit! I am beyond pleased with my purchase, and my husband is probably tired of me telling him about it!",

                "reviewText": "This stroller has exceeded my expectations. It is ridiculously lightweight and SLIM which is what I wants for going through store isles. The storage bag is smaller obviously but I got an accessory bag which takes that place. The seat goes back not flat but a good amount. The seat sits up about all the way straight which is perfect for my 1 year old because the old one slanted back and he hated it. I tried 3 of his different type of sippy cups and they all fit (just a bit snug at the very bottom) but it does actually fit in the holder. If your a mama I. The go, shopaholic, theme park family, I would recommend this hands down. Plus the wheels are regular sized, not chunky and bulky like the usual 3-wheels ones. The material is also recycled plastic so eco friendly \ud83d\ude0a also the shade hood covers more than I thought, more than my other and it was a bigger stroller.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a stroller for travel with a 7 month old. I did extensive research and combed through reviews and decided to go with this model (even though it\u2019s not very popular). It\u2019s lightweight, set up was very simple and easy and collapsing is also quite easy. The stroller itself is very sturdy and doesn\u2019t feel or look cheap. I found the three wheel to be much easier to manage and manoeuvre than my regular four wheel stroller. I\u2019m about 5\u2019 11\u2019\u2019 and I was concerned about the height and having to hunch over to push it but there were no issues with that either! I would definitely recommend!",

It\u2019s really comfortable, my little one loves to lay down. This is totally worth the money.",
