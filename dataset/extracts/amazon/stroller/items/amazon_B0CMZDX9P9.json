I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll use the balance bar though. I like how smooth the stroller is and think it takes just a bit of practice to open/close quickly because it feels like you need to remember to do multiple things simultaneously. The price point of this system is expensive but overall I do like this!",

The canopy is pretty large and gives a good coverage to the baby. Also comes with a peek a boo Window on canopy. I like how easy it is to fold and unfold this stroller from just one hand. It also comes with the car seat. The wheels runs smoothly in all types of terrain. I am very happy and satisfied with this brand.",

It is not hard to use the straps security features like it is on carriers. The stroller feels very comfortable to push and the wheels glide seamlessly.. overall I would say this stroller is definitely a high-quality class act. It is a five star in quality stroller, but it is priced a little bit too high in comparison to its competitors that offer the same features. I hate deducting a star of price, but it would not be a fair review unless I did so. if the price is about 15% lower this would be a full five star product",
