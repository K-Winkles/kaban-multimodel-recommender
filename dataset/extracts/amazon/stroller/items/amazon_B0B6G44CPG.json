                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good double-fold stroller if you\u2019re short on space, but it has some wobble and is not lightweight.",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve gone through a number of strollers, and our most recent strollers (a couple Britax travel systems, and a Baby Jogger double stroller) are bulky to leave in the backseat for daily use. With this stroller it seems like they started out designing an ultra-compact travel stroller and then bulked it up until it was no longer lightweight or ultra-compact. Here are my observations from using this stroller:1. It\u2019s a multi-step fold down process. First, the seat has to be rotated to face forward. Second you have to fold the seat in half. Third, you have to fold the stroller in on itself. Finally, you need to remove the Velcro storage compartment that sits on the handles or it just flaps around.2. The seat. The seat rotates 360 on a plastic base, and it also pops right off, which is convenient for dumping crumbs and spilt snacks.3. There\u2019s no zippered compartment. The top storage is just Velcroed on, and the main problem with it is that it keeps sliding off the handlebars. If your child sits facing you then the storage bag will slide off the handles until it rests against your child\u2019s feet.4. Seat reclines. The seat reclines, there\u2019s straps in the back that you loosen or tighten to adjust the seat angle.5. Front handlebar. The front handle bar / grab bar is removable. It pops right off for older toddlers so it doesn\u2019t get in the way.6. Brakes. The brakes are on the bottom of the stroller, and lock the two back wheels. There are no hand brakes.7. Weight and size. This weighs about 20 lbs. and is as heavy, if not heavier, then our other full size single strollers. However, it only supports a child weighing up to 33 lbs. It\u2019s more compact lengthwise when folded down for storage. If you have a SUV the size difference is not very important, but if you\u2019re putting this in the truck of a sedan, I could imagine the double fold making a difference between fitting or not fitting.8. Turning. This glides along pretty smoothly and it\u2019s not at all hard to turn in different directions. With other strollers using triangle design (i.e., one wheel in front, or two small wheels centered in the front) it can be hard to turn with only one hand. This has a nice four wheel / square design that makes it easy to turn the stroller. It\u2019s also narrow enough that you don\u2019t have problems navigating doorways.9. Durability. The main thing I don\u2019t like about this stroller is the feel. With umbrella strollers they have this wobbly/stick feel that if you shake it the whole thing might fall apart. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s that bad with this stroller, but it definitely has some of that umbrella stick/wobble feel to it. It doesn\u2019t have the rock-solid feel of other full-size strollers. I suppose that is an element of most compact double-fold strollers. The folding elements add some wobble to it and this is a multipoint fold as opposed to a stroller where you just push one button and it collapses. I suppose that is why it only supports children weighing up to 33 lbs. For comparison, my Baby Jogger can carry my 4, 3, and 1 year old at the same time with no wobble. This one wobbles a bit with just my 1 year old in it.In summary, this is a nice and compact double-fold stroller if space is at a premium. But if you have a lot of space you might be better served with a sturdy single-fold full size stroller. The difference really is whether it matters to you that this stroller has some wobble to it.",
