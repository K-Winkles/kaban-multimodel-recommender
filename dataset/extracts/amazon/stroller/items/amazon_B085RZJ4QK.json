                "reviewText": "This stroller has been amazing for our fourth little so far. We didn\u2019t need an entire travel system as we already have a car seat and a big double jogging stroller. This has been the perfect size and so functional. I was initially sold on it because we were taking a family trip to HI when 4th was only 2 mos. old. We were going to need baby\u2019s car seat and a compatible, compact, durable stroller.This stroller checked all of the marks.-It\u2019s compatible with our britax b-safe 35 car seat. It\u2019s actually compatible with any car seat via a buckle that goes across the top of the car seat (it buckles as though baby we\u2019re wearing a seatbelt.) and a set of elastic cords that can secure the car seat to two little pegs underneath. It\u2019s hard to describe but secures the car seat very well, in my opinion.-It\u2019s compact. This stroller folds down into its storage bag which fit into the overhead bin of our flight there and home, no need to check it with baggage or gate check! If need be the rear wheels are easily removable and can store inside the bag. The stroller may not fit into the compartment of smaller aircraft.- It\u2019s durable. For being such a compact stroller it has held up amazingly so far. We walked all over Waikiki with it and have been using it at least weekly since we got it. It goes to the park, to the grocery store, anywhere we need. It\u2019s compact size makes it very maneuverable. The storage basket underneath is the perfect size for my big diaper bag.I recommend adding on the carrycot if your baby will be 0-4 or 5 mos. come spring and/or nicer weather to take walks in. Our baby loves it for walks and for going to the park. Some people complain that the carrycot gets too small too quickly but our 4 month old (who is average size ~50th %ile for everything: height, weight, etc.) fits into it well. I find it handy for walks around the neighborhood and to the park when I don\u2019t want to or need to bother with the car seat.",

It is lightweight, fits in the airplane cabin overhead, folds easily, fits the car seat (I have the nuna pipa), is comfortable, can be reclined, folds into a compact size which travels easily anywhere. I can go on and on about this product especially because there is no other good product at this price with these many features. Love it! i would highly recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "This stroller has some nice features, like the lie-flat position and small fold. I also like the look of it. However, as strollers go, I find it pretty clumsy. There are straps hanging down from the back that are supposed to be for the car seat attachment, but just hang around when not in use. The break will often get clicked on when I bounce the stroller up stairs, which is a very awkward fix in the middle of a set of stairs. The strap that holds the back of the stroller up when in sitting position often slides off the hook, so my son will all of a sudden fall back. The fold is also clumsy, with the top half / hood folding with a click, but the bottom has to be pushed into place. Even when folded the hood flaps around unless you secure it with a separate strap.So looks cute and sleek, but Id say worth spending a little more nad getting a stroller that is more user friendly",
