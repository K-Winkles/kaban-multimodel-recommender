The stroller itself is easy to turn, clipping and unclipping the car seat is simple. Overall this is the best for the price! \ud83e\udd29",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good system, little issues",
                "reviewText": "This is a great system to have when you first start your family, since it comes with both the car seat and the stroller. It was packed great and easy to remove from the huge box it came in. It was easy to put together - except for the back wheels of the stroller, which had these foam pieces attached to the rods that I couldn't figure out how to remove. Once I figured it out it was just operator error! This is an all-around quality set. Here are some pros and cons:Stroller: The materials used are quality materials. Stitching and cloth are very sturdy and nice. The stroller is padded, but could be a little more thickly padded where the baby's head tends to lean against the stroller when they fall asleep. I put a little towel there to cushion our little guys head. The canopy could come down a little further to shield the baby from the sun. Note that the canopy is different - it is folded back under and you need to reach under and pop it towards you to bring it out, which offers more coverage from the sun (but still not quite enough). I will say that the straps were frustrating to elongate, but I got it done. Also, the \"ride\" is very bumpy, but it is a stroller not a jogger. I LOVE that the actual seat can be lifted and turned around to either face you or face outward. This is an easy process I appreciate. The buckles are very secure and somewhat hard to click together (I have to put my glasses on). The seat can be reclined or, for an older toddler, set up so the child is in a sitting position. There is a latch on the back of the seat that is easily used to create either of these positions. This stroller comes with a front tray for the child and a back tray for the care giver. Both are very nice. There is adequate storage under the stroller, but not big enough to store a full diaper bag. All-in-all, the pros of having this stroller negate the cons of the stroller and I am enjoying strolling my little guy around. He finds it comfortable enough that he routinely snoozes in it.Car seat: This piece of the set is much easier to review since it is what it is! It's a great car seat with lots of cushion and great 5 point harness protection. You can remove the cushy inserts to wash them if needed. The base sits easily on your cars seat and has a \"leveler\" so you can ensure the seat is sitting in its correct position. I had problems with the straps, but honestly, I have problems with all car seat straps (which can be adjusted). The seat clicks into place easily. A cool thing about this system is that you can click the car seat onto the stroller so you don't have to remove your little one from the car seat if they've fallen asleep.System: I will add that this stroller is not light weight. At least not for this 57 year old who keeps her one year old great nephew every week! It is a little cumbersome for me to collapse, so I tend to make sure I have all that done prior to getting my great nephew (I leave the stroller ready to use in my garage). If we are out and about, I make sure to pull the stroller from my car trunk before I get my little guy out and get everything set up prior to removing him from his car seat - as I need both hands to complete the stroller process.This system has been great for me in my \"new position\" :-) . I love having the ability to take my little guy places and show him the world. I would recommend this and would definitely buy it again.",

And the toddler portion of the stroller is separate so you don\u2019t have to lug around both pieces until your child is ready for just the toddler seat. It\u2019s lightweight compared to some of the other models and it\u2019s super easy to fold up!All in all, we are very happy with the purchase and we can\u2019t wait to see our little one riding in style with this sleek and SAFE travel system.",
