                "reviewText": "So far I really enjoy this wagon. My first trip with it was at the zoo. While walking I overheard someone say that it was bigger than their VEER. So let me add my PROS and CONS.PROS:Maneuverability- it is very easy to drive even with one arm. i was able to steer it and hold my son.Space- My 4 year old and my 9 month fit comfortablyAssembly- Very easy to assemble. Did it while I was watching a movie.Terrains- I have not used it in sand yet but gravel it did well. It was easy to push up slopes. I do like the push and pull capability. The wheels are durable and not cheap feeling.Extras- the snack and drink tray for the kids is an awesome plus. Side pockets for toys or whatever you might need is also helpful. The storage basket was amazing and I love how you can put it on either front or back of wagon.CONSDrink holder for adult- I wish it had a drink holder for an adult. I know you could probably add one but it's nicer when products come with these things so you don't have to go out and search for one that fits.Foldability/weight- This things folds easily and can be self standing in the fold position, which is nice. However, I wish the handle would slide down more than it does in the fold position. It takes up a lot of real estate in your vehicle. The handle bar sliding down more would just make it more compact and easier to fit in a trunk. Picking it up and loading it in my vehicle is slightly difficult due to its weight. But I guess that is to be expected with wagons.Foot area- There is an area that pops out the bottom for the feet to go. I wish you could have a way to fold or velcro it up. I wanted to lay my son down in the wagon and could not because the area with the feet will not go up. You could always shove blankets in there to even out the bottom but felt that would be a nice feature to have.Canopy- the canopy height is a little low. My 4 year olds head touches it when in certain positions. The canopy also detaches easily so my 4 year old knocked it out of place a couple of times.Overall, I would buy this product even with knowing the cons. The price point is affordable. I don't know when all baby travel products have gotten to be $500+ but am glad Evenflo created a wagon that average joe can afford. It really is the best bang for your buck. Plus, you are getting a lot for your money, it looks nice and feels durable. So far seems to be as well. I would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This thing blew me away- I had my eye on other, more expensive wagons for a while before I came across this. I liked the style and the price was much more affordable, so I went for it. I'm so glad I did.This thing is just excellently designed. After a few minutes of initial assembly, it's easy to set up or collapse again. Folded up, it takes up much less space than our old tandem-stroller used to. If anything, it's comparable to a single stroller when stored in our car. It doesn't require a lot of weird adjustments or tweaking, it just folds out into a comfortable two-seater wagon.The included sun shades fold up and down easily and never need to be removed or fussed with. The seat belts are simple and the little snack tray across the middle is brilliant for keeping a little boundary between fussy kiddos. The detachable storage basket is also great, as it gives you a little bit of shopping space if needed or can be flipped into the wagon itself if you're only hauling one kid. Another little perk is the unique look- the color and shape of this wagon is distinct enough that you can spot yours in a crowd without trouble. That can be a lifesaver when you need it.The place where it really shines is how insanely smooth the ride is. The wheels absolutely glide on any surface and is easy to push or pull (although be sure to put your biggest kid in the back so they don't throw off your steering!) I initially worried that the nearly frictionless wheels would make it prone to rolling off unattended, but the designers clearly thought of that and implemented the best stroller brakes I've used. They're light and easy to click on or off without having to smash your toes (I've permanently dented some shoes trying to lock/unlock the brakes on other strollers), and when locked the stroller doesn't budge at all.This was a great purchase. It freed up a huge amount of space in our car compared to the double-stroller we had used before, it's easier than ever to get the kids in or out of it, and they actively love it- our oldest keeps asking for wagon rides everywhere since we got it. All this for almost $200 LESS than my original choice. I can't praise it enough.",

                "reviewText": "I like it because - I have a 2 year old and this is absolutely perfect for her. She can stretch out and lay down if she is tired. I can bring a backpack or a cooler for picnic lunches or beach days. It has loads of storage and drink trays. Very easy to fold down for storage and it is smooth and easy to travel over grass and gravel.What I dont like - the drink/snack tray makes it tight for her to move around. No drink cup for my drink. Clips for the handle are not as easy to unfasten in order to turn it into wagon mode. And it is heavy! Picking it up to put in the back of my car is a work out!",
