I have arthritis in my hands and the handle of this stroller is very comfortable to use.The stroller is very stable and not tippy at all. The wheels move effortlessly over grass and trails, as well as sidewalks. They don\u2019t have a lot of tread to collect dirt. It\u2019s super easy to push uphill. It was easy to assemble (though I had assembled a couple before finding this one). I bought the front bar accessory and think this should be standard for safety.I wish there was an accessory to hold a snack cup.I think this stroller is worth the price due to the way it handles, the comfortable handlebar, and that it doesn\u2019t tip easily.",

The Minu stroller is easy to fold and unfold, fits well in the back of my suv with plenty of room for suitcases and other stuff. I love that this color doesn\u2019t show the dirt as much as a black or lighter colored material, also love the leather handles, makes it look very elegant just like my Vista.",

                "reviewText": "I was on the fence about spending this much on a stroller, but I'm really glad I did. I wanted something capable of accommodating my baby who was not quiet sitting unassisted, but large enough to last through the toddler years. Something lightweight, but not flimsy. Something that didn't take up my entire trunk. Something with decent storage for bags, groceries, etc. And something with good sun protection since I live in the tropics. This checked all of those boxes. Plus, it maneuvers well and had a really smooth ride. Only complaint is the sun shade is a little floppy in moderate to strong winds.I looked for a long time, tons of online and in store research. Tried this one in a store, and nothing I found afterwards compared.The matching accessories are not great. The cupholder sticks out and is small. Not close to being large enough for my water bottle. The organizer is ok if you want to carry items, but it's not practical for drinks. Those are more issues with the accessories though as opposed to the stroller.Overall, if you're on the fence wondering if it's worth spending $450 on a stroller, I can say I'm happy I did.",

                "reviewText": "Love this stroller for travel and basic use. It\u2019s definitely not an all terrain stroller but I didn\u2019t expect or need it to be for that purpose. We purchased a padded bag to gate check it on a flight and it held up well. When not traveling we use it at the mall, the zoo, anywhere that has a flat surface and it works great. Very smooth and great maneuverability. I really like the brake function, and the storage basket holds a large diaper bag. Very easy to fold up and doesn\u2019t take up much space in the trunk. My very tall toddler fits in it comfortably. It is on the pricier side but for the sleek look and functionality, I find the price to be worth it. I really like how you can remove the fabric seat and canopy and use it as a stroller frame for infant car seats with adapters; I look forward to using it for this purpose with future children. All in all, it is a great stroller I would recommend to anyone for not only travel, but for daily use.",

I had to return it because the shoulder straps don\u2019t adjust and they were too high when my son was in it and it wasn\u2019t safe or functional. The stroller is very sturdy and has good functionality. We only wheeled it around our house to test it, but it was smooth turning and riding. Once my son is bigger, I plan to purchase this stroller for traveling. It was lightweight and folded up nicely although didn\u2019t stay together easily when folded. Ample storage space on the bottom.",

                "reviewText": "I have a giant 22 month old (36\" tall, 35lbs) and this stroller is great for on-the-go. He likes to get out and walk around when we're shopping but this stroller is lightweight and small enough that I don't mind pushing it around in case he wants to ride again. The folding mechanism is super easy and it's easy to pick up and sit in the back of your car. I drive a Palisade and I can easily put up my third row of seats and have this folded in the very back with room for groceries/bags.Size-wise it's perfect for tall toddlers and the seat is pretty cushy. He seems a lot more comfortable than he's been in our bigger stroller that has the removable seat. We're traveling soon and I'm already less anxious knowing this stroller will be so much easier to fold and leave at the jet bridge, and I won't have to take it apart at security since the seat is attached.Definitely pricey and a luxury stroller, but for us, it's worth it.",

With that being said, we were looking for a travel stroller & I did buy the NUNA Trvl stroller as well to compare it too. Although I do like the NUNA brand, I still preferred the Minu V2 Stroller. I love the fabric of the Minu V2...it feels like athleisure clothing. I love that the basket can hold 20lbs & that you can buy lots of accessories to go w/ the stroller. I love that the stroller canopy extends longer than any other stroller & that it reclines, so my 9month old daughter can sleep if need be. The stroller is made well & doesn't feel like it's gonna break. I also love that it looks nice, has real leather accents & it\u2019s a compact size when folded. I know it's a pricier brand, but we have not been disappointed with any of their products. I think it\u2019s worth the splurge. \ud83d\ude42",
