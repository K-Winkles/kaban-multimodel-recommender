                "reviewText": "I was a little worried after reading all the reviews but made the purchase anyway based on price. I wanted it to take on vacation with my toddler grandson because the one his parents have is too big and bulky and takes up too much room in the car. It arrived just before we left so we took it in the box and assembled it upon arrival at our vacation spot.It was easy to assemble, and based on reviews, we made sure we knew how the lock mechanism worked on the front wheels that keeps them either going straight or being able to turn freely. As others said, it WAS hard to engage the mechanism at first but honestly, we left them in the free position.The stroller was lightweight, easy to fold and easy to maneuver. We LOVED the built in zippered storage pouch with cup holders! Also, the canopy\u2019s extra Sun visor was great for our little guy and there was plenty of airflow around him. Having storage underneath was an extra bonus for such an inexpensive stroller.The only thing that was at all a problem was the positioning of the vinyl footrest. It seemed to be at an awkward height so if he was using it, his knees were bent and up high - and if he extended his legs, they hung over the edge. Regardless, we loved the stroller. We used the stroller for 9 days, on concrete, on gravel, on grass - basically everywhere we went while in South Dakota. In fact, my daughter in law was so pleased with it that she ordered one as soon as we got home! She now keeps it in the car for regular use - and the big bulky stroller that was great for infants is now relegated to the garage ( for the next one ). And the one I bought stays at Nana and Papa\u2019s house so we have it for any of the grandkids who are visiting. I would recommend this stroller to anyone thinking about buying it.",

Fast delivery, the next day. It\u2019s compact, very easy to put together, light weight and our child fits perfectly. The cup holder and zipper storage are very nice. Canopy is nice has extended panel in the front and can be easily removed if needed. Stroller fold down easily and all 4 wheels can quickly and easily be detached if needed. We haven\u2019t had it out in public yet but for a few stroll around the house and driveway it\u2019s seems nice. Only down side, I wish the under storage was a smidge bigger with higher netting that went all the way around the bottom to store more but for quick trips like the doctor, store or even amusement parks this is perfect for what were looking for.",

It's fine.I really, really dislike the latch. This thing does not stay folded. I jam it against the back seat in the cargo area of my car and hope it doesn't slide back and flop open. I jam it into a corner at the gym daycare and hope it doesn't fall over and flop open. It's a 50/50 gamble every time.It occasionally doesn't close smoothly and I have to unfold it and start over for no discernible reason. A little annoying.The canopy is great when it's in place; I like that it's large compared to most umbrella strollers. But it pops off one side or the other pretty often, so unless it's absolutely pouring, I usually detach it and leave it in the car.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered both the Graco and Summer 3D stroller. Here is my opinion on the Graco compared with the Summer.Graco has taller handles, great for taller people, not necessary for my husband and me since we are of average height.The storage bin is much more accessible and is larger on the Graco due to thefolding mechanism (see photos). I prefer the Graco when it comes to folding and unfolding, they have provided larger handles for those maneuvers. However the latch that keeps the stroller closed doesn\u2019t keep the stroller as compact as it could be. Graco has provided a carrying handle mounted onto a side bar, a nice feature I think. The seat does recline, but certainly not suited for a baby under 6months. The straps are adjustable, but the Summer stroller allows for much more adjustable variations. Both strollers reclined with ease. One downside of the Graco strap: when unbuckled the over the shoulder straps don\u2019t stay attached to the waist straps. This make for 2 issues. 1. The strap comfort pads slide off every time you unbuckle 2. You have to reattach these every time you want to buckle up the kiddo. I appreciated the Summer stroller in this aspect, the shoulder straps clip onto the waist straps. Allowing them to be removed, only when you so choose. I preferred the Graco cup holder over the Summer, because it\u2019s removable and plastic. The Summer cup holder is made of material, it is flimsy, and not easily cleanable. The plus on the Summer stroller cup holder is that it has a zipper pouch for accessories, phone, etc. The Graco has a removable lap bar, while the Summer stroller does not offer this feature. They both seemed equally easy to push. The Graco has bigger wheels, making it easier to push through dirt and rocks. Overall the Summer Lite Stroller is smaller, more compact, and lighter. My husband ended up picking the Summer Lite Stroller due to its smaller size and he preferred its features over the Graco. We gifted the Graco to my 6ft tall sister and brother-in law who we thought would appreciate its larger/taller size.",

This stroller is so easy to use, lightweight and she loves going for rides outside and in the mall in it. The bottom storage is a bit small but otherwize it rides well and is padded and adjustable height. Good straps to ensure baby is secure. The top wind and sun cover is removable. I add a backpack or a grocery bag across the handles and we are good to go. It can be a bit tippy if you put too much weight on the handles but otherwize its a great height for walking for seniors and is door wide friendly. Am loving it.",

                "reviewText": "I typically don\u2019t write reviews but this stroller was a great purchase!We wanted a cheap stroller so that our heavy duty one wouldn\u2019t be damaged and because it was so bulky to travel with. Considering the price, we were expecting a truly low quality product of the summer. This was not the case! I traveled with my daughter (just over a year old) through the airport, all through a city, and the stroller held up very well. She was able to nap as the stroller reclined!Pros:- able to hold drinks, keys etc- able to hold diaper bag on the handle- easy to maneuver- easy to set up with one hand- lightweight- easy to open and close- if you need to shorten it for travel, you could ways remove the wheels and canopy (they\u2019re super easy to install!)Cons:- under stroller space is quite small (I usually put a blanket there)- a little longer than expected with no removable partsWould definitely recommend anyone planning to travel either alone or with your family as it is light weight, makes life easier, and if it gets damaged you won\u2019t be as sad due to the price :)",
