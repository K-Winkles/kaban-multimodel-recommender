It fit on the Pockit Stroller perfectly, as described, and kept our wee one dry. It could use a bit more ventilation somehow, perhaps, but when you put a baby in a plastic bubble you can't be surprised by a bit of fogging or even overheating. Very well structured so it was able to function properly without the stroller sunshade extended.",

My favorite feature is the Velcro straps on the front that hold it snug to the top of the wheels. Excellent feature, because it doesn\u2019t fly up in the wind. We live in Orlando and used this almost every day during the rainy season this year. Definitely a must have to protect your little from the elements.",
