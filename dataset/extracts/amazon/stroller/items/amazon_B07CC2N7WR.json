                "reviewText": "My daughters live off of snacks in our stroller. This is really the perfect solution to hold a bottle of water and a bunch of snacks at the same time. My oldest often yanks on it trying to get in and out of the stroller, so I know it's durable. A couple of \"gripes\": 1) I wish the buttons weren't so small and recessed on the underside, as they can be a possibility to undo the tray in the cold and/or with gloves. I guess it's more childproof, but it borders on adultproof. 2) I can't quite understand the purpose of the shallow rectangular indentation. Maybe it's supposed to be for snack containers, but pretty much everything is round, and it just doesn't fit. Maybe it's for collecting stay snacks that would otherwise bounce around the tray. It's a minor nuisance, but its purpose doesn't seem well executed. Overall, though, a great accessory, but the price borders on absurd for what it is, hence one star off.",
