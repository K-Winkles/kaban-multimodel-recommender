                "reviewText": "I can't say enough about this stroller!!! Between babysitting and my first child, I've tried a few strollers. I always dreamed of one that the carseat clicked into with my first, so with my second I was determined to get one. I was so happy to find this double one in our budget (let's be real, doubles that fold and have the features this does are stupid expensive, $600??? Crazy! Not this one!!)My child came super early and had to be on oxygen and constant monitoring. This also required countless appts. This stroller can hold all of that and a giant backpack in the bottom and still be easy to get into the bag and press buttons on monitors! It maneuvers amazingly! Hospitals have elevators and lots of people and twists and turns. I can navigate all of that one handed with this stroller (mind you that was only one seat and child, but I can't imagine too much harder with both). I can still push both kiddos in it with one hand on footpaths and decently through grass. Uphill requires two hands, but that's ANY stroller ha!Seats move and change so easy!!The basket holds a crap ton! It has held a 50lb toddler when we didn't have the second seat on hand. It holds two bags of cat food and a GIANT diaper bag! I have put countless things in that basket and it rocks! Seriously one of my favorite features!The folding! So so easy! I'm constantly putting in and out of my trunk and needed one that folded well and quickly. Two little pull tabs and it is swinging in. Only trick is when you're opening it (one handed latch fyi), if you aren't careful, the handle will scratch the ground. It's really only an aesthetic problem. I've learned how to open it right so it won't scratch! I suggest trying it a few times on carpet before you are on concrete/pavement.The handle adjusts!!! This is amazing! So many strollers don't so I was so happy this one does! Also, one foot brake. Very easy to press!The peekaboo flap actually stays open! It doesn't have velcro but it is properly fitted to stay open when you want it open! Hallelujah! I was constantly fighting with my previous stroller! Not any more!I have a honda accord and it fits in my trunk with ROOM to spare. I store toddler seat separate in back and the stroller to side front. I can still fit cat food and a decent amount of groceries in my trunk! That is impressive. I had a stroller before for one kid and could only fit the stroller \ud83d\ude44Only Downfalls:I wish the toddler seat was completely flat in bassinet position, or could become completely flat. The incline is good for sids protection, but when you want to change a diaper, the slight incline is a slight pain.The handle scraping if you aren't careful. It has a weird unfolding trajectory (not bad, just different) if you haven't practiced so definitely practice to get the hand of it.The shade could be a tad longer or would he cool if you could swing it more into a 180. When the toddler seat is flat or in the middle position before a full sit, the shade isn't quite covering of the baby's face. For a toddler it probably works, but I wish I could get a tad more or adjust it for times the sun is lower. Not a deal breaker since we can just clip a blanket to shade a bit.This isn't a problem for me but should definitely be checked if you're worried. It is a little heavier. I think it is easy to lift one armed in and out of a trunk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but it could be a pain for some. If you're worried, check one out at a store. **My two cents, with all the weight this sucker can carry and maneuver smoothly, it makes sense it weighs a bit more.**Definitely get the evenflo accessories package for it. The bag is worth every bit!!",

                "reviewText": "Our first stroller was compatible with our infant seat and was loud, ugly, and difficult to use. Plus it tipped over anytime we hung the diaper bag from the handle meaning we either had to carry it or lose valuable storage space underneath. For our second kid we did some extensive research and landed on this\u2014 so glad we did, we couldn\u2019t be happier!Our favorite features:- Assembly is a breeze- Easily converts for use with 1 or 2 kids while remaining compact and attractive. We use the included seat (which both my infant and toddler find comfortable), the adapter for our Chicco infant seat, and the rider board. With the number of configurations between the three it has always been comfortable and exactly what we needed for our two kids.- The large rubber wheels make the ride quiet, smooth, and easy to navigate over different terrain.- Even with the weight of two kids it can be steered with one hand!- It\u2019s weight makes it extra sturdy and durable leading me to believe it will last (we\u2019ve had it 9mo and so far no issues!).-There\u2019s plenty of room in the storage basket for a diaper bag or a few groceries, even while holding 2 kids.The pitfalls:- Folding it up can be cumbersome as the seat has to be removed before it\u2019ll collapse to fit into a compact space. It\u2019s really simple, just slightly time consuming and you have to keep track of all the pieces in the trunk. Not the most ideal for a cold/hot/windy day when all you want is to be able to jump right into your car or quickly get inside.- It takes up about 2/3 the trunk space in my compact car- The removable cup holder is flimsy and easily tilts to spill whatever it\u2019s holding.For us the pros far outweigh the cons and we would highly recommend this stroller to anyone planning to have one or more kids! Wish it was around when we had our first so we hadn\u2019t spent the money on a different (more expensive) stroller that was rarely used because we disliked it so much. Plus the price is an added bonus! We visited Disney with this stroller and were stopped so many times by people asking to know more\u2014 trust me, if you go with this you\u2019ll be glad you did!",

                "reviewText": "I love this stroller first it\u2019s super compact when it\u2019s folded up. Second it fits well in our trunk. Third easy to assemble and easy to put together when going to use it.You can make lots of adjustmentsFor us we love it because we have convertible car seats not the carrier ones and we needed a stroller to push our newborns around that wouldn\u2019t break the bank. And this is that. There\u2019s options to make it into toddler seats and carriage like seats for baby to lay down and sleep and the best part you don\u2019t have to buy any inserts or extra pieces .! It has great suspension and a easy to use break . That\u2019s big bit like those small ones on the sides with double it\u2019s just one big pedal which I like! It is big but not hard to push around at all. Fits in store isles which i love! Also a big basket on the bottom !",

Very large cargo compartment underneath for shopping and baby paraphernalia. The modular design makes it easy for adding addition seats for more children. Easy to manoeuvre swivel wheels in front help with turns. Toe breaks on back wheels very convenient.I would recommend this pram over the competition (ie:Graco) much better build not as flimsy.",

El asiento se acuesta y se sienta por completo lo que hace que el beb\u00e9 tenga una muy buena vista del paisaje, cosa que con otras carriolas no ocurre.No es calurosa.Colores bonitos. El asiento lo puedes poner de muchas formas. Con vista hacia adelante o atr\u00e1s e incluso mas arriba o mas abajo.La canasta es de s\u00faper bien tama\u00f1o.Contras: Pesa. Pesa mucho. Subir el esqueleto al auto es una cosa de pensarse.Al andar en la calle si hay espacios angostos no gira tan facil hay que batallar. Si vas en camino amplio es una maravilla pero espacios normales a chicos, no es muy c\u00f3moda.",
