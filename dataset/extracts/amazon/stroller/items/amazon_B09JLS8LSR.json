My only problem with it is it doesn\u2019t go up as much as I\u2019d like it to so my kids end up slightly tilted towards the back. But I have found this to be the same with the other two single strollers I\u2019ve owned. I use it at Disneyland most of the time and it fits in at least all shops.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to purchase this due to lack of reviews and no name brand but I wasn\u2019t happy with the big name options plus their prices were just too high. I was very specific in the features I was looking for and I\u2019m happy with my purchase. First of all it\u2019s extremely light weight and compact which was super important to me for small space and travel ability. No problem getting in and out of the car and also great for the airport. The fold and unfold is beautiful! One handed no need to lean over the front and pull with two hands, I could fold this while holding a baby and I love that it folds in on itself to protect the fabric. It has canopies with a zipper third panel that are good and they also have magnetic peekaboo windows to not wake baby. The foot rests are adjustable although I can\u2019t see myself ever putting them down bc if we do the seats are too shallow. With the foot rests out the seats are fine. Love the harness and closure and it comes with a cup holder! There is lack of storage in the back of the seats so I bought a mommy organizer that I clipped on. The height of the seats is not great. My 5 year olds head hits the top pocket but she\u2019ll manage and walk most of the time but keep in mind if you have tall children it\u2019s not great. Because it\u2019s lightweight it definitely feels heavy to push with my 3 year old and 5 year old but I knew that I would be compromising there and didn\u2019t care because I prefer the weight of the stroller to be lighter. The bottom baskets are what sold me. They\u2019re not huge but they are generous enough and ACCESSIBLE! The flap pops out to open up bigger and I can fit a full diaper bag on each basket. The recline is average- not full, so no newborn but it\u2019s enough for a nap. I wish the upright position was a little straighter but it\u2019s decent - some strollers are literally still reclined when upright. This one is slightly still tilted but fine enough. I plan to bring this to Disney and can\u2019t wait. Hope to update my review after that! Overall a good unique buy that served my main priority needs - lightweight, compact, good fold, big storage baskets below. Check!",

I have irish twins and they are 3 and 4 and they were not comfortable at all.The real headache cane with shipping this item back I was initially charged $150 I had to be constantly messaging the company and then amazonthis is sold and shipped through a third party so just beware because they were hesitant to give me a refund and shipping back was a nightmare",

                "reviewText": "First of all, the stroller is incredibly easy to open and close! I have had several double strollers and I have never had one that I can get in and out of my car this quickly before. The handlebar is relatively high and the wheels glide really beautifully. There is nice storage bins underneath, and the leg rests are pretty sturdy. The canopies are a nice size as well. My one complaint is that the seats are slightly too reclined, but my two kids seem comfortable in it so that might just be my perception. Definitely recommend this stroller for the price point",
