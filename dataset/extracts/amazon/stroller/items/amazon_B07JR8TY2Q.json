                "reviewText": "This is one of four strollers we own and has been fantastic for us. We started using this with our first baby at around 5-6 months. We go about 2 miles a day mostly on city blocks, but also on very uneven/rocky country roads (we\u2019re talking cow pasture here!). After about 14 months of constant use, it has held up very well and is only about to be retired in lieu of a double stroller for baby #2.Pros:-Easy to push and works well on many different surfaces. The ability to lock the front wheel helps a lot for off road terrain.-Fairly light weight and easy to fold - even throughout most of my second pregnancy I was able to lift it in and out of our SUV trunk.-All parts of the stroller have held up incredibly well.-Storage is not ideal, but functional for carrying quite a few lighter items (not the full diaper bag) and fairly easy to access even when the stroller is fully reclined. We typically bring water bottles, sunscreen, an extra blanket and a few snacks.-Our favorite part is that baby #1 has been very comfortable in this stroller, in fact it\u2019s become our fail safe method for nap time and plan many of our walks around it.Cons:It\u2019s not perfect, but I think it\u2019s a great option for the price!-We did purchase a different stroller for the newborn phase (until the baby can hold their head up independently) and also separate one for travel as this is fairly bulky. In retrospect, there may be a better \u201call purpose\u201d option at a higher price (rather the same price as all 3 strollers!)-The inner tube tires are terrible! They popped within two months of use - we\u2019re taking full on slashed tires after a stroll around town. However the solution is easy and affordable... replace with these slime tires: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BF96ZR2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_f1m-EbS3P401J-I wish the storage was a little better so we could do more grocery shopping. We are 1-2 miles from markets, which is just a little too far to maneuver the stroller and carry groceries at the same time.In summary, we have been very pleased with this. and will plan to use it again with baby #2. We did finally take the plunge with the Bumbleride Indie Twin, which will be our daily stroller from now on, but once the older toddler is a little more mobile, I imagine we\u2019ll probably go back to using this quite often.",

                "reviewText": "The Jeep Classic Jogging Stroller by Delta Children has been a game-changer for my active lifestyle as a parent. Its sturdy construction and smooth maneuverability make it a reliable choice for jogging and outdoor adventures. The adjustable handlebar and reclining seat add to the comfort factor for both the child and the person pushing the stroller. The storage compartments are handy for carrying essentials but it really needs to be a little larger! The sun canopy provides excellent protection. While it may be bulkier than some other strollers, it's a trade-off for its durability and stability during runs. Overall, this jogging stroller lives up to the Jeep brand's reputation for ruggedness, making it a great investment for parents who enjoy staying active while spending quality time with their little one.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is legit AF! It encompasses 95% what high end strollers are at 1/3 the cost. Seriously can\u2019t beat this stroller. It\u2019s Jeep branded which is sleek and encompasses that outdoorsyness. It\u2019s sturdy, made well, powered by Jeep, front swivel works super smooth with 2 options, and overall it\u2019s smooth.The main push handle could be a little sleeker but let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re gonna use this thing alot and it doesn\u2019t need to be fancy.See people complaining about it folding compact, these are large wheels and as with most strollers it can only get so compact so not a deal breaker. A tricycle design can only do so much lol.Weight is ok, not heavy and obviously not carbon fiber light but this thing is legit.Have no idea how you could ask for more at the price point it\u2019s being offered at.Worth every penny and dodging the overpriced high end ones. Highly recommend.The only negative thing id ad are the cup holders. Slightly flimsy, good for a 20oz drink tops. However I have a Nuna pipa travel system that I spent $1000 on and that didn\u2019t even bring a single cup holder, so again no real complaints on this Jeep stroller.",

Tray is just ok. Easy to clip on & release. Cup holders for \"Mom\" are worthless beyond a 16oz plastic H2O bottle--Very narrow & they swivel, which means a tall, narrow tumbler tips over. Nowhere to really put any other accessories for easy access, while pushing.I have a Ford Edge V6 Limited Edition SUV & this jogger fits without collapsing the back seats, but it's a tight squeeze for anything else. Great simple, handy jogger for value. Would jot recommend for a \"i use my stroller every day\" Mom that would want something a little more LUX but it is perfect for occasional use, without breaking your piggy bank.",
