                "reviewText": "SO GLAD we purchased this for an international trip with small children.Roomy enough to fit two small, young elementary-aged children SEATED (for example, a small second-grader and a kindergartener might be the limit), or ONE small second-grader lying down (it\u2019s trickier to fit TWO small children lying down- maybe if they were two smaller toddlers).Folds quickly, easily and small for all of the security checks and modes of transport (fits nicely in car trunks).We were able to fit it in the overhead cabin on our international flights (doubt it would ever fit under the seat).The kids loved it and constantly begged us to take it out and cart them around the airports with it. They loved the canopy for funsies. They loved taking turns pushing each other in it.It IS a bit of a workout pulling two elementary-aged children for long periods of time, but even an out-of-shape person can handle it.One of the kids slept for a GOOD amount of time at the gate, when we had been up for hours since the middle of the night, and then our flights were delayed for hours after that \ud83d\ude44We also used this a lot for waits in long lines (security, check-in), walks to food and toilets, and times when there weren\u2019t enough chairs available for everyone to sit together.Appreciated the wheel brakes when we DIDN\u2019T want the kids to push it around, and loved the side pockets for water bottles, Kindles, jackets, etc.Also appreciated the luggage strap on the outside of the bag, to prop it on top of a rolling suitcase, as it IS a bit heavy to carry on the shoulder- though it\u2019s definitely doable.Passers-by in every airport were so bemused by seeing us carting our kids around in this, and we got lots of compliments.AMAZING purchase.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this for a cruise in Norway, that required air travel. It folds to fit in the overhead compartment perfectly. Kept 1 year old and 4 year old kids secure comfortably, and was easy enough to pull that our 4 and 6 year old could both sit in it for awhile. Also worked for keeping backpacks contained for potty breaks, and was comfortable enough that the baby would fall asleep in it. We didn't try to maneuver it through the cruise ship, we carried it off and set it up outside, but it's smaller than a motorized scooter. I was so glad I brought this instead of a stroller, because of the versatility.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We ordered this collapsible wagon for our annual Christmas trip. It was mostly assembled right out of the box, just a few inspections and attaching the canopy. Quick & easy! It folds into a compact size and comes with a nice travel bag. The travel bag actually has a storage pouch and turns into a pillow. Our child doesn't like sitting in her travel stroller but she loves sitting in the wagon. We buckled her into the wagon for a walk around the neighborhood. We went to the zoo and our six month old was able to lay down comfortably for a nap. It's a very convenient and versatile product. Our parents even took it with them to the farmers market. I would definitely recommend this to parents or anyone looking for a quality and space efficient wagon.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, the EVER Advanced foldable wagon is smaller than I expected. But maybe this one wagon could folding and friendly on the board. The size is no more big than the on board luggage case. The wagon also included a storage bag and good for storage and keep it clean. It is more convenient than ordinoray folding baby strollers.The wheels are not particularly large, and they are suitable for towing on smooth surfaces. The The two wheels have foot brakes, which are still very safe to use. The wheels designed the anti shock and more comfortable for towing on the rough road. The wagon could bear is 110lb weight, which can almost support two toddlers or one toddler with some luggage. But I like this wagon most with removeable tent, and it is still very useful in summer. There is a five-point shoulder strap on one side, which is very good for fixed the baby.",

                "reviewText": "The wagon is very smooth. It pulls so easily. It also is the perfect size for a carryon. I didn\u2019t have any trouble putting in the overhead bin. Unfortunately, the bag and sun shade were missing from the box. Normally I would\u2019ve returned it, but I really needed the wagon for a trip the next day. It would be 5 stars if I had all the pieces.Update:Ever Advanced promptly sent me a new wagon! I only wanted the missing pieces but they sent the whole thing. I love it even more with the sunshade! We\u2019ve gone on a few walks with it and I haven\u2019t had any issues. We\u2019ve been in stores, sidewalks, parks, grass, uneven dirty roads, it\u2019s done great with all of them. I will always recommend this company. It can be nerve wracking buying things online so knowing it\u2019s a complaint with great customer service makes buying this a no brainer. We still laugh about how impressed the flight attendants were with this thing! They couldn\u2019t believe it folded so small. If you take it to the airport, be prepared to answer questions \ud83d\ude05",
