So far, I've enjoyed all of my runs using this stroller. (I've only taken it on paved roads - unsure how it handles off-road). Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "For years we had a crappy regular stroller that felt every bump and struggled to go on any terrain other than smooth roads.....so glad I chose this stroller! It's so smooth and comfortable. The seat is comfortable for my 18 month old and allows her to sit upright enough to see while the canopy provides a great amount of coverage to protect against the sun. The tires are huge and sturdy, and yet it's soooo easy to fold up and fits in the trunk of my nissan sedan no problem! It is heavier than non jogging strollers but I'm 5'2\" and I don't struggle with it at all. I haven't used it while jogging yet but using it I'm confident it would work great! You will not find another stroller at this price that's better. If you're endlessly searching thru reviews and comparing strollers and keep coming back to this one (like I did) just get it!",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I both love this stroller. She was given several different strollers by her siblings, friends, etc, and none has been as robust as this one; in fact we've passed most of them along while holding onto this one.I like it because the handle is adjustable up/down and even though I'm very tall (6'-8\" w/ 38\" inseam), my hands rest comfortably on the handle when it is adjusted up. I also like it because we live on acreage and this buggy is able to cruise over mowed grass fields and gravel driveways effortlessly... gravel doesn't even cause it to vibrate and bounce around as some of our other strollers do. I really wanted to find a buggy with some sort of suspension system built in, but when I was unsuccessful in finding what I wanted, I purchased this model, and as it turns out, it functions just as well as I would have hoped, even without any sort of visible suspension. It really is impressive how smooth it is on our gravel driveway.Weaknesses include the fact it does not fold up very flat... at all. When folded, it would fit nicely in a box with dimensions 3' x 3' x 2'. It is also somewhat difficult to fold, relative to some other strollers we've had. By difficult I don't mean hard, but it's not intuitive... I had to study it for a few minutes to figure out how to do it, and some might describe me as mechanically inclined. It is also not the lightest, but it's not unreasonably heavy; weight is the price paid for the nice, large, pneumatic tires which are the reason it rolls so nicely over rough terrain. I can't comment on the car seat adapter, as we don't use it. The sun shade is nice, as is the peek-through window in the sun shade. Finally, and probably the most important, our daughter (14 mo now) doesn't mind it at all, and maybe even enjoys being strapped into it :)All in all, I would recommend this buggy for anyone, as long as you have a second, smaller buggy to keep in the car for those days when you're in and out of the car a lot. This buggy is easy to live with as long as you don't have to pack it in and out a bunch, and the smooth, quiet ride and nice ergonomics for both adult and baby are worth the extra hassle to fold it and stow it if you're going somewhere and you're planning to stay a while (zoo, mall, etc).",

                "reviewText": "This stroller has a nice smooth ride. It folds and unfolds easily, but it's a two handed job. Not what I would call light weight. Main complaint is that the back does not allow the child to fully sit up. Looks great and is well constructed.",

                "reviewText": "Seriously an incredible stroller. It\u2019s easy to fold and store. It\u2019s light weight. The tires are so easy to take off and put on. It\u2019s a bit on the larger size but it\u2019s glides so effortlessly. Great taking on gravel or light terrain. Comparable with several car seats and so easy to put the car seat in and take it out. This is a stroller that you\u2019ll keep as your baby grows. I needed a stroller so I could go on long walks/run with baby and this is a must! Has cup holders and an undercarriage part to store things. If you\u2019re a running/walker\u2026 GET THIS :)",
