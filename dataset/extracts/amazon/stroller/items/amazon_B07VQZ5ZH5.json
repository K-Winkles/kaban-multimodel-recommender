                "reviewText": "This bike went together fairly easily, no cursing or banging. There is an option for placing the seat, either closer or a bit further away from the front of the bike. As we have an 18 month old I first used the set of holes that placed the seat closer to the pedals and handlebars. But our boy found this uncomfortable; he could not place his feet on the pads designed for smaller children before they are old enough to reach the pedals. Our boy ended-up putting his feet i=on the front fender, and his feet kept falling into the front wheel. I moved the seat back to the other set of holes and this pretty well somved the problem until he grows. The steering is comfortable, our boy likes ringing the bell, and the canopy is appreciated on sunny or rainy days. Wish there was a cup holder for Dad's water bottle, but you cannot have everything. Very pleased with our purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my 2 years old. Very well build, and strong. The pushing handle can control the front wheel. Instructions are very easy to understand and easy to set up. Took it for a walk and the wide tires are very stable and easily controlled, like the break function it's good for parking but still it will be better to keep holding it with one hand for safety while parked if the kid is riding. Hope this helps.",
