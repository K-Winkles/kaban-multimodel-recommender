                "reviewText": "My favorite features are the handle & the recline;1. Handle: The handle easily flips to the opposite side for a forward or parent facing stroll. The downside to this is when you are parent facing, the front wheels (originally the back) don\u2019t rotate, making it difficult to turn since the drive is now leading with the wheels fixed on an axle. When the handle is in the original position (baby facing outward), the handle sits high and when the handle is flipped to the opposite side (baby facing you) the handle will fall lower\u2014 you can\u2019t adjust the height of the handle, so for me (5\u20193\u201d) I feel the handle is too high but it\u2019s not really an issue and you get used to it. Also, bc of the handle\u2019s flip-able feature and shape it might be difficult to attach a stroller caddy on it but a diaper bag can still be attached to it.2. Recline: My favorite feature is that the seat fully reclines to almost 180 degrees flat (I believe it\u2019s technically 170). It\u2019s flat enough that you can use it as a changing table. This is Perfect if you don\u2019t like taking your baby to small or dirty bathrooms and public changing tables. Also, if you\u2019re solo and have other kiddos with you, you don\u2019t have to worry about hauling everyone into a bathroom, you can change diapers right in the stroller with a simple recline. It basically turns into a bassinet.Other details:I don\u2019t understand the excess fabric on the canopy, it doesn\u2019t allow for extra coverage so it just sits like a tail. I wish the fabric of the seat was softer but my baby doesn\u2019t seem to mind it. It folds and unfolds very easily. Since there isn\u2019t a caddy space on the handle (which in most strollers would include a cup holder) I wish the child\u2019s tray had two cup holders instead of one.Overall, this is a great, solid stroller, it has all the important features and it\u2019s a fair price.Assembly: The assembly was super simple with exception to attaching the back wheels to the back axle- pushing the pins in to secure the wheels was difficult. Apparently others had issues with this too, but once you pop the pins in there everything else comes together very easily, no tools required.",

                "reviewText": "So, I received a graco jogging stroller as a baby gift and I HATED it so I went on a search for an affordable stroller that was easy to maneuver. And this stroller was it. It was very easy to assemble and much lighter than my graco. It\u2019s easy to collapse and set back up. You can even set the back or front wheels to stay straight. My graco snug ride car seat clicks right into it and can be rear facing because you can switch the handle either way! I love how you can lay the seat all the way down so very easy to change a diaper in or have them take a nap! I do with they had a parent cup holder but it\u2019s not the end of the world. The storage is a little small but my diaper bag easily fits over the stroller handle. Overall, I love this product.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know where to start With this stroller/ Pram...Okay this stroller is not balanced on the side walks it controls you. Going all over the place. The reverse makes it worse. It goes sideways and you fight to keep it going straight when you're done from walks or erands you're supper exhausted. Make sure you always strap in your baby because if hit a bump on the side walk they will literally slide out the bottom of the hand rail. Another experience I had was it was going smoothly until one part of the side way had a crack and one of the wheels went in the dip and it almost tupple over to the side. More over if the side walks / pavement is only 1/4\" inch high it can't even go over.\" If you have back pain this stroller is not for you.\" You literally need to bend down and put one of the front wheel forward on the sidewalk/ pavement. I took it spin at the nearest trader Joe's and I place some of my goods in the tray which by the way is really small if u have a diaper bag. Took much weight makes if off balance as well. I'm sorry I got this stroller.",

                "reviewText": "The idea of the stroller is great however there are some minor things I don\u2019t like. First, it did not come with the Jeep logo on the canopy. I messaged the seller and NO response. I saw a lot of reviews saying the same thing and I was hopeful I would be the exception but no. That\u2019s ok I can live without it. When baby is facing me it is a little difficult to steer but you learn to steer it in that manner. Takes getting used to. The wheels aren\u2019t the smoothest when going over bumps.. it takes some pushing. I had to return my first stroller and order a new one because the handle cracked on both sides when slightly pushed down to get the back of the stroller up above a short step. We were shocked it was such cheap material. Amazon was kind enough to replace it but I have to return my original. That will be impossible with how big it is\u2026!It is not an easy fold and unfold and it is big bulky and heavy. The wheels are in the way when baby is facing me but I can learn to walk around it and I don\u2019t have large feet. Husband on the other hand has a frustrating time with it.Assembly was okay.Baby LOVES it because she can see mama and sit up and look all around her. She is 11 mo and does tend to slouch and lean to one side because the straps aren\u2019t too tight but I make it that way because then she can\u2019t sit up.Sad that it doesn\u2019t come with cup holders.All in all. I ordered the second replacement and plan to continue using it bc it\u2019s cheap and it gets the job done which is for my daughter to face me.",
