The wonderfold is easy to get kids in and out with multiple seating options. 9 times out of 10 I use It without the seats so they can roam around and it takes less time to set up. Fits in my Toyota Rav 4 as long as the trunk is empty and I angle it correctly when I put it in. Then, there's still tons of room for groceries/diaper bag/etc. My mother in law is 95 and pushes it with ease, turns great, pushes perfectly. Perfect amount of storage. Kids love it and it allows them some freedom to move which gives me more time to shop and run errands more peacefully. I'm not a big fan of the seatbelts as they take quite a bit of time to get strapped in and lined up properly to connect but again I typically use it without the seats so that's not a huge deal. If you're thinking about it, get it, you don't regret it! Well worth the money when comparing to other options.",

                "reviewText": "We've had this orange Wonderfold for over a year now! The pictures are attached are after a whole year's worth of wear and tear.When we first purchased I probably would have given it 3/5 stars for weight and size. After a year: I would give this 6/5 stars. It's amazing.Let me start by saying, this thing is a beast and can take a serious beating. (It also seriously needs some love from the green machine but I can't be bothered) It has endured 2+ toddlers every day for over a year. We've taken it on trails, to events, shopping, and daily multiple-mile walks. It has served as a portable play yard and nap-wagon. It has been used in the heat, the cold, and at the pool. We have taken this thing everywhere! I don't go anywhere without our Wonderfold Wagon.We chose orange for safety. I wanted the kids visible for evening walks/events/etc and boy are they visible! Had intended to add some reflectors for extra visibility but just never got around to it.We chose the 4 seater because we have multiple cousins close in age and our nanny brings her toddler with her when she watches the kids. That's 3 kids under 3 every week for over a year straight. She's a petite woman and is easily able to maneuver this hulking thing.It's a double-wide-surprise, I'll give it that. But the amount of space so our kids can roll and roam around is top notch. It handles spills well, even a whole water bottle emptied out. It has many pockets (6 generously sized with 4 out of reach of little hands, and 2 side pockets conveniently located for sippy cups/bottles) and comes with a basket (or a step stool in my son's case, and it's perfect for all those wonderful little rocks, sticks and leaves that get picked up by the handfuls on walks) Milk spills and crushed up goldfish are nothing for this durable fabric. The pad at the bottom comes out for easy vacuuming. Very little fraying after so long. It turns easily with the sturdy bar handle and can be adjusted for a little person height if the mood to push Sissy around like a princess strikes while we're out. The bench seats are removable and come with 5 point harnesses (but the Olympic sport of strapping in an angry toddler has not been made easy by these straps and godspeed to you fellow parent-you're on your own there.) It comes with a canopy that has been both the best thing and the bane of my existence. My child thinks that the adjustable height canopy is the uneven bars and he's prepping for his state gymnastics tournament. Unless the weather calls for it, we stow it away. It is not water proof, which would be nice as we are outside all season kind of people, but it does well for shade. Speaking of hot weather, the netted side fabric is great for airflow, but not so great when those brisk cold winds start blowing. The size, however, allows for plenty of blanket storage or even to adjust the canopy for a makeshift changing area for both kids or to shield the littles from some of the cold.It has a little escape hatch for getting in and out, but for my own sanity we don't use it, and I'm not about to show my little tyrants where it is and how to open it. Take that how you will.We probably need new wheels, they've begun to get stringy and torn from rolling over so many rocks and wildlife. (Sorry thumper, you'll be missed).The only downside to this epic playpen on wheels, is that to fold it down you have to remove the benches and snap down the bar handle. It's cumbersome and takes up most of my entire trunk. This is a small grievance, as I said it's huge and handy to have, so if you have a crossover or SUV or Truck, this will fit in the trunk.We bought this at around $750 retail and viewed it as an investment. It has paid itself off ten-fold. If you're hesitating - don't.The weight limit is 200lbs, if you are under this - you could use it as a drinking wagon to cart your blitzed friends around during a pubcrawl when the kids outgrow it. Just saying. Not speaking from experience.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this a month ago because my old extra long red wagon broke (due to having more kids and they gotten bigger). Best purchase ever. It came in within 4 days (Ordered on Sunday and arrived on Thursday) . I have 4 kids under 7 and I take them out to the zoo, mall, outdoor, etc.. almost every weekend. We go to the Houston Zoo every other weekend.The Pros:The wagon is well designed and has good seat/space efficiency. The seats are attached via big strong clips to the top bar frame. This allows the weights to be distribute evenly. When pushing this wagon with 4 kids for a total of 160lb, it feels pretty easy even going on a ramp or tight turns. It has a very good wide turn radius (Better than my Graco jog stroller and way better than those pull wagons. Lots of time the wagon would almost flip over with the kids inside during tight turns. Totally not safe).This thing has tons of storage space. You can store food/water cooler in the attached \"trunk\" basket, the front has a big pouch for storing clothes/diapers, and space under the seats for storing their toys or another cooler. If you like to bring the whole house and food for 10 days like my wife does for the kids, this wagon is it. It is the \"Escalade\" of stroller wagon.Width and length of this thing is the same size of one of those jogger strollers. You can go with ease through doors, waiting lines for rides/exhibit, tight corners, and crowded gift stores with no problem. I see moms/dads with those double side by side strollers struggle to get through doors and tight fence lines. This thing is also tall enough for the kids to stand/sit and safely see those 4ft tall fish/snake exhibits and fences that they have the zoo. Unlike strollers, the kids also have a 360 degree view of everything around them. Before the kids would either stand up on the old shorter/unsafe/unstable/wobbly red wagon or I would have to pick them up on each exhibit. And I have 4 kids to do this with.The wagon also has a curved detachable cover that can be move/shirt from sides to sides. The curved angle cover allows it to block the sun from every angle. If the sun is coming from the right, you slide the fabric cover down to the right. If the sun is coming from the left, you slide down the fabric cover to the left. If it is nice and cloudy or going indoor, you can detach the cover and just hang it on on the push handle.The wheels are big and made of soft rubber. This allows for the wagons to be pushed and move easily with heavy weight. The soft rubber allows to for comfortable ride compared to those hard plastic wheels on those standard pull wagon. I took this wagon on the Metro Train/MetroRail during the Houston Rodeo. The wheels went smoothly over the gap between the waiting station and the train without any problems.I'm 5'8 and 145lb dad and sometimes go without mom, so I think most moms or dads should be able to handle this thing without any problem. If you are a tiny mom and planing on going by yourself with this thing, I recommend getting help to load and unload from your car.The Cons:This thing is big and tall when folded. It might not fit all SUV/Minivan. I have a 2014 Toyota Sienna and to fit this and another baby stroller, I had to remove the push handle bar. The handle push bar can be removed easily because it uses 4 big plastic hand screw knobs. The Toyota Sienna has a deep trunk base, so it can fit this standing up.Being a dad, the worse part about this thing is every 10 minutes someone would stop me and ask me where I got this thing from and what it is call. During Spring Break, I took this thing to the Houston Rodeo twice, to the zoo, and to Kemah board walk. Every 10mins I had to repeat \"I got this thing from Amazon and it is call the Familidoo\". Being a big wagon with 4 kids and bright Orange like a school bus didn't really help me stay low key. They have this in gray also, but I chose bright orange so I can easily find it if I park it somewhere.The base can get dirt pretty easily due to 4 sets of feet/shoes and Houston humid/wet/damp weather. You might want to get another canvas or small sheet of tarp that is easier to clean/wash with to cover the base.AMAZON and FAMILIDOO - PLEASE READ BELOW!!!If there have been orders from the Houston areas within this week due to me taking this thing to the Houston Rodeo, Zoo, and Kemah Boardwalk and stop to answer questions about where to get this, I want a percentage of the sales for my trouble and this thing being almost $500. But it is worth every penny. Thanks Amazon and Familidoo :)",

What I did was replace the top threaded knob with a quick release pin. No more screwing in the bolt, just slide the pin in and its good to go. The Wonder 4 is quote heavy for my wife but i love it cause its comfortable for the three kids we have. Pricey, yes but it will last your family a very long time.",

Will it be too big to bring it out in Singapore?But this is the only wagon that I can chuck all my children inside at one go so I just ordered. I'm glad I had ordered it before the price doubled. Item came after a month. I am happy that I ordered this original w4 model. The aqua colour is beautiful. And also because it is not as huge as i had imagined. The wagon can move inside my house. My kids are elated, they are always playing and riding on it. I can't wait to push them every morning to their schoolOnly complain is that it is hard to get the accessories like raincover, all weather mat, snack tray etc. I had to purchase via wonderfold in US, and had someone there to post it to me here.But overall, I am a satisfied customer.",

This is a glorified playpen on wheels, as well as a 4 seater wagon and it will change your life!! The confidence it gave me alone was worth the price. I could take all 4 kids out, from the time my youngest was a newborn with such ease! It\u2019s easy to push, and totally essential for moms like me with 4 kids all 6 years old and under (have been using since the kids were newborn, 2, 3.5 and 5.5 years old). The baby would either be held by my oldest on the floor of the wagon or would be in the carrier until he could sit up and use the seat. He would nap in the bottom of the wagon before then as well as now! We use this wagon at the beach for our littlest to romp around in and watch us play in the sand and water without helping himself to the sand and getting gross. It\u2019s hard to push through the sand or gravel-as i would expect....but it\u2019s really not an issue. This is my number one baby gear item that I can\u2019t live without. It fits perfectly in my trunk without any issue of a protruding handle bar(like some have said). I have a 2020 Honda Odyssey. It\u2019s heavy but not terribly so-I haul it in and out of my car 2-3 times a week. It can folded with 1 set of seats in, with a bit of tweaking. The basket in the front is so handy!!! And the side pockets and back pocket make for tons of storage. I\u2019ve had many kids pile in here. With my 4 it IS hard to turn a bit but without it I literally could not have gone out by myself with all my kids at the stages they were in 1. Without worrying about any running off or 2. With all of the extra cargo required (diaper bag, cooler, picnic blanket....sleds....extra jackets...shareable snacks for gatherings...camp chairs etc. It is worth every penny ....1 year later I\u2019m saying the same thing. Everyone who sees us agrees at how fabulous it is. We get stopped all the time-even single middle aged men appreciate this impressive kid-mobile!",
