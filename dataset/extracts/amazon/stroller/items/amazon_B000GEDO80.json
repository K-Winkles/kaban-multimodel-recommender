It's made of lightweight clear plastic which made it easy to wad up and store in the basket of the stroller. If the plastic had been a lot thicker I think it would have been bulkier to fold up and store so I'm pleased with how lightweight it is. I haven't been able to use my cover yet, but I'm looking forward to testing it out soon. I don't anticipate having any issues with it since it covers the frame of my stroller perfectly and fastens securely with velcro straps.When you compare this to the current prices on Mountain Buggy double stroller rain covers ($50-75), this is a steal!",

                "reviewText": "Edited to add our stroller model. It was a Tike Tech double jogging stroller, but the old model that had 2 front wheels.Here's the original review:I'm in a situation where I (stupidly) didn't buy the rain cover for my stroller when I bought the stroller. I'm in Oregon, what was I thinking? Once I came to my senses and realized I needed one the stroller manufacturer had changed their models' styling and no longer have a double stroller with 2 wheels in front. I emailed them to ask if the new cover would fit my year-old stroller and got no reply. I really didn't want to spend $45-50 on a cover that might not fit, so I tried looking for a more generic cover. I'm so glad I did!This cover is so much cheaper and it does the job. No, it doesn't fit tightly, but it's vinyl and I'm glad fresh air is getting in there to my kids so I see that as a plus. My daughter sometimes hates having it over her shoes but the generically placed velcro means that I can still keep my son covered and dry while the 2yo gets a little rain on her hands. All in all I'm very thankful I tried the cheaper generic cover because I think her hissy fits would have meant I couldn't have used all the lock-down snaps on the more expensive custom cover, if it would have worked on our stroller at all.I would give the thing 5 stars if it wasn't for all the time I had to have it sit in our mud room off-gassing before I was willing to use it.",

Better than anything else I came across, wel worth the money even if it only lasts one trip. We'll likely get 1 heavy duty Disney trip and several lighter trips out of it. We live in Arizona, so don't need often here.... mostly take with us when traveling to wetter environments. Used on 2016 city mini gt.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this rain cover for my Bob Revolution double jogger. It doesn't fit the Bob at all, don't even try. I say the product is awful, though, because it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. It ripped along one seam so I figured I would still try it thinking I could tape it or something. As I tried to get it over the stroller it ripped again in several more places. Granted, it doesn't fit the Bob, and that is why I would expect it to rip if I was trying to force it on to make it fit. But I was being extra careful since it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. I sent it back. Pay the extra money and get the cover made for your specific stroller. I learned my lesson trying to be cheap.",
