        "description": "When your little one needs a quiet moment, Evenflo\u00ae Pivot Vizor\u2122 Travel System has it covered \u2013 literally. This is the only travel system with a mesh privacy shade to accompany your infant's car seat and stroller in both toddler and carriage modes. The privacy shade stores in a handy bumper bar pouch so it's ready at a second's notice, then zips to either canopy in no time \u2013 no tools necessary! How does it work? When it's time to break out the two-piece cover, simply unzip the top portion and attach to the toddler seat. Or you can pull the bottom portion from the pouch's zippered pocket and attach it to either the toddler seat or infant seat. Our Pivot Vizor Travel System is wildly popular for a versatile design that grows with your child. The reversible, modular frame allows baby to face in or out \u2013 in carriage mode, car seat mode or toddler mode. Not just clever, convenient. In all, there are 6 modes of use to choose from. Why so many? Because, as every parent knows, it's a relief to have options! The Pivot Vizor Travel System brings together a modular stroller designed for a child up to 55 lb with the Evenflo LiteMax\u2122 Infant Car Seat for infants weighing from 4 to 35 lb. With large cruiser tires, front-wheel swivel and rear-wheel suspension, baby will appreciate a smoother ride and superior maneuverability. With a flip-flop friendly brake to keep the stroller still as you take your child in and out, an oversized peek-a-boo window for keeping tabs on baby, an oversized storage basket, and a flex-hold cup holder for the driver that locks to keep beverages secure, you'll have plenty to be happy about, too. For even more riding options, you can also add the accessory Stroller Rider Board (sold separately). Use it for an extra passenger or simply to give your child a way to quickly hop on and off when little legs need a break.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller is awesome. We used it with the car seat till he outgrew it (we have a big boy). At 1 year 24lbs the only reason I\u2019m switching is because with need a more airplane/stair friendly stroller. That being said we did use this for a flight which was great. It did not go in the overhead bin, we gate checked it. We kept having to carry it up 3 flights of stairs when the elevator went down. It\u2019s not great for that.",
