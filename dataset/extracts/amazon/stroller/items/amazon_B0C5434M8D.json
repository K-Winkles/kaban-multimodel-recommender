This the THE BEST, most HIGH QUALITY stroller wagon you\u2019re going to own. Trust me; we have 4. Don\u2019t waste your time and just get this one FIRST! We strapped the twins in to try it, and they didn\u2019t want to get out. Not kidding! We put a few toys in there to entertain them, but honestly, the babies really just LOVED putting their cups in the cup holder over and over again. And they didn\u2019t cry, even when their Goldfish (tm) ran out. Ha! There\u2019s plenty of room in this stroller, without it being obnoxiously monstrous. It was absolutely just right. The padding was there; It wasn\u2019t the thickest, but way more padding than other wagons. It has two harnesses as well, which some wagons don\u2019t have! The cover can be removed for cleaning, there\u2019s ALL KINDS of storage all over this thing, it rides smooth as butter, the 5-position handle is cushy and wonderful with zero weak points, and the whole stroller folds up in about 10 seconds. Tell me, what\u2019s not to love?!",

Its nice to be able to put the baby in there with toys and they can play when at places like amusement parks and events. Easy to fold and put in vehicle, much easier than my double stroller I had before. When packed for our trip you can take off wheels easily to make it easier to mend into luggage or give more space. Looks beautiful and has so much storage I don't even need my diaper bag.Doesn't push or pull good on super soft sand if you're a beach person, expect lots of work.. But did good on other beaches where the sand was more compact.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this for a two week trip to New England in the winter. My kids are 3 and 5 - we were a little worried about the weight load but it can hold 50lbs on each side (100 total) and it never felt rickety or like we were in danger of being over the weight load. My kids fit great sitting criss cross applesauce in it. My son didn\u2019t ride in it much as he is older and capable of walking just fine but it proved extremely helpful for my 3 year old who still naps. She laid down in it and slept all the time on our long days out in the cold walking around. We used it at the airport to carry bags and kids - it\u2019s easily pushable. The handle is adjustable at different angles. When I first tried it I was worried the handle was a little wimpy for the heavy load, but it held up great with no problems. The brake is easy to engage and disengage. Words cannot describe how EASY it is to fold up and down. I\u2019ve used a lot of strollers and carriers in my day as a nanny and mom, this is hands down the best. There is really good storage on the front and back as well. We navigated cobblestone streets, low packed gravel, dirt, icy side walks, small amounts of snow (nothing too deep) and elevators. For small shops and tight restaurants it pops down easily to be stored to the side of your table. I can\u2019t speak highly enough about helpful this was for our travels. I don\u2019t know if it works great for infants who need a car seat attached (check detail description to find out) but it does have seat belts for young kids that need some support still. We didn\u2019t need that feature. My only knit pick (that several have mentioned) is the rain / sun cover only works on one side\u2026and there is no attachment to purchase for the other side separately. We bought a generic clear rain cover for carts like this, and it worked okay, but didn\u2019t fit quite right and was awkward (we made it work by sorta holding it on while we walked). Luckily, we didn\u2019t have much rain. If you know you\u2019ll need top cover for rain bring umbrellas or you may need to fashion your own cover by cutting and modifying a generic one. Jeep if you made some all terrain wheels that could work in snow, sand that could be purchased as an add on plus a better sun/rain cover \u2014 this thing would be flawless. But again, it served our purposely perfectly. Both my kids sleep in it at one point all curled up on one of our longer walks, with several hills. Buy it! Especially if you are traveling by plane, you won\u2019t regret. We also use this for our dog sometimes (who is older and has back problems for long walks) and just for carting around groceries and gardening.",

I was looking at the jeep stroller wagons for awhile but the price made me steer clear.However, this is so worth the money!!It was a million times easier to put together then my radio flyer wagon. It glides so easy on the grass and is super easy to pack. I have a large 3year old ( he wears a 5t) and its very spacious for him. I know this is going to grow with him.I wish i would have brought this wagon first!",

                "reviewText": "We ordered this as a gift for my daughter to grow into in the next year so we can use it on family outings and adventures. The assembly was pretty easy, no tools required, and it seems very sturdy! There are tons of pockets for storage and I LOVE that there are two seatbelts and a removable tray for snacks and drinks for the littles. We cant wait to test it out at the zoo with our friends in the spring! We havent tried to fold it up yet bit it looks pretty easy!",

The super expensive brands I looked at all charged extra for the accessories. Great quality and value. Only thing I'd change would to offer more padding on the bottom since the seats aren't raised up like other brands. Otherwise, my little guy and I love it.",

                "reviewText": "This thing was so handy to have at the stock show! Will say it was great for a baby, a diaper bag, blankets and toys, and room for jackets on top. Not much more room than that. So if you want more room than that you probably need to upgrade, but it\u2019s plenty for us! The ride was smooth and nice and our kiddo loved getting a new perspective of everything. It\u2019s very light and super simple to fold up and load. Takes up a bit more room than our key fit caddy but not much more! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Especially since it\u2019s a cheaper Jeep option",
