Sit and stand maxed out child size can be up to clothing size 10/12. Even if you don\u2019t need it for two kids, it has the perfect amount of space that can hold bags/purses/backpacks.It\u2019s got that extra room.Stroller is perfect for traveling.Can fit in a gate check storage bag.Definitely recommend.*comparison wise, I would compare this to a Chicco Bravo 2.

It has space for each of them to sit comfortably, there\u2019s space in the bottom basket, it folds easily, and does not take up too much space.My only dislikes, so far are that the shade canopy hooks off real easily when I fold and unfold the stroller. Also, the seatbelt for where my 4 year old sits is a bit hard to loosen/tighten and sort of sits awkwardly. Besides these two things, it\u2019s still a great stroller for the price and just what I needed to be able to push my babies.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking for a sit-stand stroller (at a low price), GET THIS ONE. Seriously. We started with the big in-line convertible double stroller from Baby Trend, and this one is SO MUCH BETTER. It\u2019s smaller folded up (can fit in car trunks and our travel double stroller bag now), it\u2019s so much easier to navigate (I can use one hand!), all of the cup holders are bigger, the front seat reclines more, the canopy is huge and actually works, the foot wheel locks are sooo much easier to use, and the bottom storage basket is not only bigger but easily accessible two different ways. My only complaint is you can\u2019t fold it up with one hand, and unfolding it takes a little finesse. But Baby Trend seriously took all of the bad reviews about the other stroller and fixed them with this one. And the seat is sooo soft and plush, my baby actually cried because I was taking him OUT of the stroller\u2014he usually cries when he has to go in it! Look no further, this is the best bang for your buck by far.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best value/ overall an excellent stroller",
                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research and comparison before buying, and after using it daily for a few weeks I can say I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase. I\u2019ve had quite a few strollers over the years, and I\u2019d be happy with it even if it had cost a bit more - but ESPECIALLY considering the low price, this is definitely 5 stars for the value.Here\u2019s what I like about it, and why I chose it:1. Price! Frankly, I could afford to buy a much fancier combo, but experience (I\u2019ve got kids ranging from zero to 9) tells me that you don\u2019t need a stroller like this for that long. In a year or two I\u2019m much more likely to reach for my city mini when taking my two youngest for a long walk or a trip to an outdoor event, etc. The main purpose of this stroller is to use for errands and grocery runs, not for heavy duty long time use. Doesn\u2019t make sense to splurge.2. I love that it comes with the car seat and base, and requires no adapters.3. It is surprisingly agile, like a much more expensive stroller, and can be easily maneuvered with one hand.4. Great cup holder and good sized basket.5. Pretty lightweight, and doesn\u2019t take up as much space as a \u201cfull\u201d double stroller. I didn\u2019t want a full 2 seater bc A) they\u2019re huge and heavy and B) toddlers usually want to walk anyway. The little jump seat and standing board are perfect to be able to contain a toddler or give them a place to rest when tired, without being an enormous double.Here are a few drawbacks or design flaws, none of which cause me any serious problems:1. My toddler sometimes reaches his foot out and steps on the brakes. I\u2019m teaching him not to do this. Still, the brakes are easy to engage and easy to lift and are well placed for convenience, so I\u2019m not sure where else they would put them. I think it\u2019s just a thing you have to discourage your kid from doing.2. The canopy/shade could be a little better. It works great for giving full coverage to the baby carrier, but can\u2019t really cover both children fully. Still, even my more expensive strollers fail to cover 100% (feet and legs are left exposed) so this is nothing new. I toss 2 cheap ponchos under all my strollers so if we get caught In the rain, I have one to wear and one to drape over the stroller. This has worked out great for years.3. It\u2019s not a super smooth one-hand fold, as you can start the fold with one hand but you kind of need to use your other hand to yank it all the way closed. Really not a big deal.All in all, very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend.",

I have a 2,3 & 4 year old. 2 yr sits up front my 3 yr old sits in the middle with her legs in the basket and my 4 yr old stands on the back. They love it and think it\u2019s so fun. Even though my daughter puts her legs in the basket, there is still room to be able to put stuff down there! Also I have a Honda accord and it fits my trunk! Although Honda accords do have a bigger trunk space then most I believe it would fit other sedans as well. I have mine in there now and was able to also fit groceries in the trunk. This stroller would be good for kids that can sit up on there own and have that back strength. The straps up front secure the child very well. Over all I\u2019m happy and it\u2019s affordable. Side note I tried the normal sit and stand and I do not recommend if you have a Sedan! It does not fit. I forced one in my trunk and it\u2019s a nightmare to get in and out. So get the Sit & Stand Shopper!",
