Super easy to \u201cput together\u201d no actual assembly required, just snap the basket in place. It is light weight but very sturdy, locks in place, but also folds up easy to fit in trunk of car with no problem. We have tried so many carts over the years that haven\u2019t held up or were too hard or heavy to use. This is it for us. We travel a lot and Max just had surgery, he rides easy in the top basket with our heavy load on the bottom. This thing is even shock absorbent! I can\u2019t wait for festival season and camping trips. This will make our everyday grocery and shopping trips so much more convenient. This is our new go to cart. Completely worth it!\ufffc",

                "reviewText": "I was impressed with quality of this product (expected at this price point, though): no assembly effort needed, nice clip-on wheels, adjustable bar etc. It's like a high end stroller but is not mistaken to be a stroller. It's a game changer for us in New York City. People are already taking pictures of it!But, unfortunately, it suffers from a design problem that could easily be avoided. Specifically when empty, front wheels come off the ground with a tiny downward push to the bar. This can be dangerously unstable if you need to lean on it, and therefore not a good product for senior people who might need to lean.",
