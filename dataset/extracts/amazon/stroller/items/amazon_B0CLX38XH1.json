This stroller size is in between a compact umbrella stroller and a regular stroller. So it\u2019s not super small or too bulky.The quality is great and easy to put together. It probably took me 5 minutes to install everything. It seems to be well built, sturdy, and drives really smooth. I have only used it inside the house so far so I can\u2019t attest to how it will do in different terrains. It weighs about 15lbs and has a handle on the side for easy carrying.Super easy to fold and the back is able to go down during nap time. It has a good size canopy for sun coverage. It has a small basket at the bottom you probably can fit a few small items or medium size purse. I don\u2019t think you will be able to fit a full size baby bag.I\u2019m not impressed about the cup holder, it is small and won\u2019t be able to hold a water bottle. It will hold a standard milk bottle, but nothing bigger than that. The height is another issue for me. I\u2019m 5\u20191\u2019\u2019 on a good day and my husband is 5\u201910\u2019\u2019 so finding a stroller has always been a challenge. The handle is too high for me, but fits him well. So, I would say this stroller will be more comfortable for taller people. Another issue I have is the back at its most forward position is slightly inclined. I wish it can go forward another 1-2inches but it\u2019s not a deal breaker.Overall, I\u2019m pretty happy and I think this stroller will be small enough for traveling.",
