We\u2019ve take it through dirt, rock, and wood chips. All handles very well. For the price, I would buy this again any day over the very expensive Veer brand wagon.The only downside is that it doesn\u2019t fold up very small to fit in the back of a car. It folds slim, but still the same length. Overall love it!",

Yes it\u2019s a little big, but it\u2019s basically a dual stroller replacement for us in the second vehicle. And something we can grow with when the kids are both toddlers.",

(I'm 5'2 and struggled to lift an maneuver it to future in our car.-Doesn't fold very compact so it likely wont fit into most small suvs in. It's a tight fit in our Hyundai Tucson without wheels.I ended up comparing this to the new evenflo pivot explore dreamz and kept the evenflo dreamz instead.",

As far as price goes it is definitely the best value for this type of wagon, we looked into the veer but it would have cost nearly twice as much after getting all of the accessories that come with this one.I am only 5\u20191 and am able to manage the wagon on my own. It is a little heavy and large but I can get it in and out of my SUV with no issues.It does take a bit to get used to the push, it\u2019s not quite the same as a regular strollerWe mostly use it outdoors or in bigger open areas like aquariums etc. I probably wouldn\u2019t use it as an every day stroller it would be difficult to manage inside smaller places like the grocery store or anywhere super crowded.We have had it for 2 years now and used it with the adapter for an infant carrier and now use it with our 2 & 4 year olds. The canopies are a little short for my 4 year old but he doesn\u2019t seem to care and still tries to close him and his sister up in them.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to get this wagon since I first started looking at wagons for our daughter. I was trying to plan ahead for our growing family and wanted one that could also carry a car seat for our next little one. This wagon checked all the boxes and is well worth the price. My first use just so happened to be during a surprise snow storm and let me tell you the complete zip canopy was clutch! The little ones stayed dry and warm snuggled up with blankets. I did find the canopy zipper a little difficult to get going on the first use but has been getting easier with each use. I recommend putting some type of pull tab on the zipper for easier use. The weight is not bad especially with the quality of wagon and the folding feature is super easy to use! Maneuvering through tight aisles in a store can be challenging but doable (also going from a stroller to a wagon is not the same maneuverability.) Overall I highly recommend this wagon to anyone looking to switch from strollers.",

One of the canopies won't fully extend properly, and I find the smaller wheels a little shaky depending on the terrain. But overall we live it!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this one so bad! But unfortunately the Gladly one was just too small for my almost 3.5 yr and my 9 month boys. My oldest could not sit straight up under the canopy. He\u2019s not tall for his age.. just average.. maybe about 38-39 inches. The leg room was also very cramped. His knees touched the bottom of the snack tray a lot. We found the Radio Flyer Voya to be a perfect size for us. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "While I did not end up keeping this wagon (too large for my needs), I can say a few things-1) customer service was super helpful and prompt with their responses and my return went smoothly.2) the wagon itself is awesome if you\u2019re looking for a larger wagon with a foot well. Also, this wagon comes with canopy\u2019s, detachable bag, comfort padding for the seats and a napping station (unlike other expensive wagons). Tried it inside my home; steering was easy. Very well made!!Honestly I would have kept it if it was smaller. Again , the company was great to work with and understanding of my return.",
