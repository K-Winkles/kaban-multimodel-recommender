                "reviewText": "I got this seat because I wanted to be able to take my 5 month old infant in the wagon with my 2.5 year old. Because my infant is not able to hold her head up yet, much less sit, I needed a safer way to take her on our strolls.I got this about a month ago now, and at first didn\u2019t realize that it reclined (the instructions didn\u2019t make it clear) so she was sitting awkwardly in the seat. Then after a couple of walks and feeling uneasy about how she was sitting, I figured it out by looking up instructions on YouTube. I bought those inserts you see for car seats, and boom\u2026 it was perfect. She fits snugly and safely in the seat from then on. I take it off, which is very easy to do, when putting it in the car since I drive a mid size suv (2016 Subaru Forester) and it fits in between the handle and the folded seat part of the wagon. It does take up the whole trunk, but I normally only keep it in when I\u2019m going to the park or doing very light shopping.Overall I think it\u2019s a good buy if you are needing to use the wagon for an infant and/or have multiple kids. With the leg part folded back, my 2.5 year old fits in the seat facing her sister with plenty of space and can pull the canopy over herself (see in picture). It\u2019s very sturdy and haven\u2019t noticed any issues with the constant disassembling I do (at least three to four times a week) to get it in and out of the car.",

                "reviewText": "I love this cuz I\u2019m a single mom and it makes it possible for me to push all three kids in one wagon/stroller. The only thing I\u2019d change is I wish the seat was a tad higher up cuz my kids are tall and the seat is right in their face and the seat itself even when locked in is a bit wobbly. I feel like for the price it should be better quality but it makes my life convenient so it\u2019s really nice.",

                "reviewText": "Happy with this addition so far. Wasn\u2019t quite sure how much room there would be behind/under the seat for the child in the wagon portion, but ended up being enough and seemed like quite ample space. We were quite surprised at the max weight rating for it which seems quite high. The two pieces are quite bulky to transport however. Will need to separate the 2 and even with the wagon portion folded, will find it difficult to fit in most cars. This top portion really doesn\u2019t fold up much, so you sorta end up with 2 space hogs. It\u2019s kinda like a Cadillac- it\u2019s as big as a boat but rides like a dream and enough room to hide a body. It won\u2019t fit in the trunk of a Malibu, but in my pickup it fits amply in the bed with the tonneau cover closed. I would recommend this if you the wagon part and are adding a child. This is nicer than dealing with 2 strollers and has room for days. But it is a larger device than some other options.",

Also the seat reclines which is super helpful for nap time! This wagon has always been my favorite stroller ever and I take it every where, so I\u2019m super happy with the added seat for my next kiddo.",
