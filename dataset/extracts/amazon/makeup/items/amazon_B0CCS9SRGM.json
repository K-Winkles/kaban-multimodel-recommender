I was looking at my pencil holder and thought: \"What if I had something that held my make up like that?\"I found this on Amazon and it's not only really good looking, but it also is a great space saver for my desktop. It spins very smoothly, and the base does not slide around.If considering as a gift, be aware the packaging makes it look cheap. I am rather picky about how things look from the outside, and this is just wrapped in a brown paper box that screams China. Room for improvement in the marketing department.5 stars for a nice product.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes the most inexpensive looking item is exactly what you've been looking for ... cost and workmanship has nothing to do with it. It may seem like a backhanded compliment, but this review is actually a testimonial from a very satisfied customer. With this rotating container, I hit the jackpot. One look at this item online, and it screamed \"come to mama\". I have gazillions of skincare and makeup items. So many that I can't keep them straight or figure out the best way to organize and store the ones used most for easy access. Believe me, I've tried everything and still kept searching ...What I lacked in my storage repertoire was something that could hold mascaras, eye liners, eyebrow applicators, and concealers. All vertically little devils that take up alot of space horizontally. This little revolving miracle holds all those mentioned items that I use most often in one place, and can twirl it to my heart's content with everything visible and easily accessible in a compact caddy. Nirvana. It's a tad gawdy and cheaply made, but it does the trick with no complaints. Every day I give thanks to the makeup gods that this caddy has streamlined my access to products. It looks good in my bathroom makeup cupboard, takes up literally no space, and twirls like a ballerina. The feet aren't matched. One is shorter than the others, but the lopsided caddy still manages to remain stable. Not sure how long it will last. It's the kind of thing one would see at the 99 cent store, or Dollar Tree, or Dollar Merchandise, but this one is at a higher price. The price is high for what is and the quality of workmanship, but the functionality is priceless to me. Just goes to show you that price doesn't always matter.I've tried to display the quantity is can hold as viewed from angles of the items I mentioned. For comparison I threw in some pics of skincare bottles viewed from the top down to give a different perspective. This caddy isn't being showcased in my bathroom for everyone to see. It's strictly has a utilitarian purpose and I'm beyond happy with it. It solved a huge problem for me and saves alot of space. I just hope it lasts forever.",
