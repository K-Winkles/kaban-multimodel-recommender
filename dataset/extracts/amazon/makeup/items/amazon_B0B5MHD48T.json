                "reviewText": "The e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a game-changer for those seeking a natural, dewy complexion without the heaviness of a traditional foundation. I use powder foundation often, but it's not as dewy or glowy as this product or a liquid foundation in general. With a lot of my friends saying this is is perfect balance between coverage and comfort, I was eager to put this product to the test.The first thing that struck me about the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is its sheer coverage and lightweight finish. It glides onto the skin effortlessly, giving a light wash of color to even out the skin tone. I use concealer to cover up dark marks and my hormonal acne. I love wearing this everyday because of its lightweight formula is a breath of fresh air compared to heavy foundations that can leave your skin feeling suffocated.One of the standout features of this product is its ability to deliver a radiant glow that looks both natural and healthy. It's like capturing the perfect \"lit-from-within\" look without the need for highlighters, foundation, or a lot of extra products. It's really a one and done! The subtle shimmer in the formula catches the light beautifully, giving your skin a luminous boost that lasts all day.The only downside is the limited shade range. While the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a wonderful option for those with medium-toned skin, it falls short in accommodating individuals with darker or paler complexions. This oversight is disappointing, as makeup should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is a fantastic choice for those who want a sheer, lightweight, and radiant finish that's leagues ahead of heavy foundations. It effortlessly achieves a natural and healthy glow that enhances your beauty. However, e.l.f. needs to seriously expand its shade range to cater to a broader spectrum of skin tones, so that everyone can enjoy this glowing sensation!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Glowing Like a Halo, But I'm No Angel: My Take on e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter",
                "reviewText": "So, I decided to give the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter a whirl, hoping to turn my skin from \"dull daily routine\" to \"divine radiance\". Spoiler alert: I'm now glowing so much, I might start guiding lost ships at sea.First Impressions and Packaging:At first glance, the packaging screams sleek and chic, much like the outfit I\u2019d wear if I ever left my sweatpants.Texture, Application, and Feel:The texture is smoother than my dance moves on a Saturday night. It\u2019s lightweight, and blending it into my skin was easier than my decision to hit snooze every morning. It left my skin feeling like it had just had a spa day \u2013 hydrated, happy, and slightly confused about being treated so well.Performance and Wear:This liquid filter promises a glowing, soft-focus effect, and let me tell you, it delivers. I looked in the mirror and thought, \u201cWho is she, and how can I keep her around?\u201d It's like having an Instagram filter in a bottle, minus the digital manipulation and existential crisis.Scent and Ingredients:It's fragrance-free, which is perfect for anyone whose skin throws a tantrum at the slightest whiff of perfume. The ingredient list didn't require me to have a chemistry degree to understand, so that's a plus.Versatility:You can wear it alone, mix it with foundation, or apply it as a highlighter. It's like the Swiss Army knife of makeup, but please don't take it camping.Value for Money:Considering it turns my complexion from \"meh\" to \"miraculous\" without requiring a small loan, I'd say it's good value for money.Final Thoughts:Overall, the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter is like a magic wand for your face. It gives a natural, radiant glow that says, \u201cI drink enough water and get eight hours of sleep\u201d even if your lifestyle screams the opposite. Highly recommend if you want to look like you're glowing with health, or if you just enjoy pretending you have your life together.",

                "reviewText": "Received the incorrect shade. I already have shade 1, and it's close enough to my skin tone that I don't mind having a second, but I had ordered shade 0. I wanted something lighter for the fact that I'm so pale in the winter.The product itself came in perfect condition, and it's fantastic if you've never used it. Gives a slight shine to the skin, and layers well with other foundations. It's not over the top. Just makes your skin look very hydrated and glowing. It's sheer, not full coverage. I use a matte foundation on areas where I want less shine or need more coverage.",

                "reviewText": "Saw about this on social media and thought I'd try it on my mature dry skin. First, using a brush rather than the applicator, it provides a very light cover that brightens my skin after ice applied my moisturizer. All imperfections aren't hidden but I'm not trying to. I then put Elta MD tinted SPF over it and I love how fresh it looks. Second, shade 3.5 is perfect for my skin. I've tried several foundations over the years and never found such a good match. I don't know if I was trying to light of colors but this blends in really well.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a new foundation with light to medium coverage. I tried out the fair/light color and let me tell you, I am floored. I use a similar product from SuperGoop (GlowScreen), but this is a fraction of the cost. The only thing it\u2019s missing is SPF, but I use a different one already underneath, so it\u2019s fine. The coverage is light, but comprehensive. Gently evens out my skin tone, while adding a mild luminescence. I know it\u2019s technically for UNDER makeup, but more make up on top isn\u2019t even necessary. E.l.f. really does a good job with some of their products and the price cannot be beat. For reference, I\u2019m 35 years old. I work outside, and have definitely had my share of sun exposure.",

                "reviewTitle": "easy to use",
                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am very impressed with the results. It is a lightweight liquid that adds a subtle glow to my skin without looking greasy or glittery. It also hydrates and smooths my skin, thanks to the hyaluronic acid and other nourishing ingredients.I use this product in two ways: as a primer and as a highlighter. As a primer, I apply a thin layer all over my face after moisturizing and before foundation. It gives me a natural-looking radiance that shines through my makeup. It also helps my foundation glide on smoothly and last longer.As a highlighter, I dab a small amount on the high points of my face, such as my cheekbones, brow bones, nose, and cupid's bow. It adds a beautiful dimension and glow to my face without being too obvious or overpowering. It blends easily with my fingers or a sponge and does not disturb my makeup.The product comes in three shades: white gold, rose gold, and golden peach. I have fair skin with cool undertones and I use the white gold shade. It suits my skin tone perfectly and does not look too yellow or pink. The other shades might work better for warmer or deeper skin tones.The packaging is simple but elegant. It is a glass bottle with a pump dispenser and a silver cap. The pump is easy to control and dispenses the right amount of product. The bottle is sturdy and travel-friendly.The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the product. It is $10 for 0.85 oz (25 ml), which is cheaper than many similar products from other brands. It is also vegan and cruelty-free, which is a plus for me.Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to add some glow and hydration to their skin. It is versatile, easy to use, and affordable. It is one of my favorite products from e.l.f. and I will definitely repurchase it when I run out.",
