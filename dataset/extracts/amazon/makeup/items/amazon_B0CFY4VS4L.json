I used a lighter lip gloss over it and it's OK, but I don't think it is as described. It is moisturising and doesn't dry my lips. I though I would also try berry banana, it is the colour of clay.....",

There isn\u2019t much difference from an appearance perspective. I also did a swatch on my hand\u2026the faint swatch is from applying the same amount you would normally put on your lips. The darker swatch is if I applied a LOT. Lovely colour, just very faint and not noticeable with normal application. But having said that, it is very moisturising and doesn\u2019t feel heavy. I can definitely see using it, but only when I\u2019m looking for a chapstick rather than a lipstick.",
