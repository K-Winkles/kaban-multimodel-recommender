It's shimmery but not overally glittery, and the lip gloss is not tacky and does not smell or taste strange. The amount you get in the bottle will last you a while, so it is a great value. It does transfer onto cups when you're drinking and onto masks if you wear one, but I think that's a given with all lip glosses.",

                "reviewText": "I have sensitive skin & used this product many years ago. It was my one of my favorite glosses so I decided to try it again. It's long lasting, not sticky, goes on smooth and is very moisturizing. I can't say it smells good, but it's not bad either. I prefer neutral color lips with a slight frost, so my favorite from this bunch was Date Night. It's sheer with just a hint of color on my lips. Captivate Me came in second; it's also a good neutral tone for me but has just a touch more glitter, which I'm not really fond of, but it works in that shade. Stay my Rose & Blushing Belgraves were too glittery and too light for my tastes. Maybe if I used a lip liner, they would be okay. Grind Time was a beautiful, deep wine color. There was some shimmer to it, but it wasn't so glittery. It was actually a bit darker on my lips than what the photo shows. In the tubes, the colors seem more brown, but they're really more pink. In all, this gloss doesn't disappoint and I would definitely repurchase.",

                "reviewText": "I somehow wasn't expecting such a glittery gloss -- from the pictures I saw I thought it was going to be more subtly shimmery. This gloss has actual chunks of silver glitter, which is not my preference -- it feels a bit sandy on the lips. The result is also a bit frosty which makes me feel a bit like I'm back in elementary school.The color (Blushing Belgraves) is a very pretty mauve-y pink which works with my cool-toned skin.The smell (and flavor, I guess) reminds me a bit of sunblock. Kind of beachy.It definitely doesn't last 6 hours, but it's easy enough to apply and works pretty much the way one expects gloss to work. I'm not blown away but also not mad at the price point. Likely wouldn't buy it again though.",
