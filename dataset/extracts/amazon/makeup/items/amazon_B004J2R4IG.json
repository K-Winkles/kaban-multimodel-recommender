They do the trick and you can always upgrade later once you get the hang of it. But for now, this is good enough for me.",

It holds the colour well and distributes it exactly where I put it, no waste and no mess. The first one still looks brand new so I doubt that I'll need another. Excellent price and very quick delivery. Don't be fooled by the small size, it's amazing.",
