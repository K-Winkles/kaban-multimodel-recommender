I'm more of a matte girl, with a bit of shimmer in the inside corners, but these just didn't look right. I needed to pack it on, but be careful not to pack it on too much, because even with lots of blending, the mattes just kinda stayed where they were put. The shimmers fell out during the day, so I had shimmering cheeks by the afternoon. I see all the reviews saying this would be a good starter palette for a teen, but I think it would be a hard one to learn with!",

This palette is very beautiful with nice soft glam colors and goes on smooth blends well I was surprised for the price it's long lasting doesn't rub off and easy to use it comes with a mirror but no brush. I hope this helps have a good day.",
