It is a non-metallic and matte eyeliner pencil, but the color pigmentation is just as great, if not better and the application on the skin is just as smooth and buttery as the others. I really like the matte effect on my eyes, it is great for days when you want a more natural makeup look and it does not make my eyes feel dry throughout the day at all. It is also pretty long lasting overall, not that I move around a ton working from home, but still, I never have to re-touch it and it does not smudge over time either. Being a fan of NYX products for a while, this is one I am really happy to have in my collection and one I would definitely recommend if you like a warm and colorful tone that still gives off a bright natural look on the skin.",

No pulling and dragging on the sensitive eyelids to deposit enough colour.Personally, I'm not into the dramatic eye look, but this would certainly do the trick if I were. Because it's a mechanical pencil, you always have \"sharpened\" end for a crisp, smooth line that you can make thinner or thicker with a little pressure or change in angle.I really like this liner and will get a lot of use out of it.
