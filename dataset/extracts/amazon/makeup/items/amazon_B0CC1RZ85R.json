                "reviewText": "I ordered this bc it was relatively cheap for 3 products, two of which were what I was intending to buy. I wasnt in need of a highlighter but buying the trio was cheaper than buying the blush and bronzer separately.I was initially going to purchase sheglam but they didnt have my shade. For reference, Ive never used sheglam products and this was my first time using a cream/liquid blush and this is the second brand of liquid bronzer Ive tried. I tried out elf halo glow contour prior to this purchase and really liked it.Ill start with the positives: affordability is great, the bottles feel nice, the applicator is nice. The paint on the front is already starting to wear off and Ive only handled the bottles 4 or 5 times. The blush is really pigmented, which a lot of people seem to like but Im more of a buildable type of gal.Now onto the negatives and how this product didn't suit my needs: both the bronzer and blush were patchy when I tried blending with my finger. I have not tried to blend with a brush but I will and come back to update the review. When I tried to build up the blush color it also was patchy and started to lift up the first layer I applied in certain spots. The blush had the very faintest bit of glitter in it. And when I mean glitter, I mean speckles of tiny glitter. Unfortunately, its not a finely milled glitter that you would want in a highlight or blush. I personally was wanting a matte blush but thats probably on me for not reading the description thoroughly. I also bought this blindly so idk if sheglams liquid blush also has illuminating properties. The worst offender of the trio was the highlighter. Again, bigger chunks of glitter than I want in my highlighter. It wasnt really luminous or radiant, it was literally just liquid base with glitter. It looks cheap and like it belongs in a younger girls play makeup bag. I dont want to be dramatic and say that its literally huge chunks of glitter, its just noticable chunks of sparkles that you can detect with your eye instead of the luminous, dewy type highlighter that Im use to and looking for.The bronzer was ok. Patchy but again, I used my finger not a brush. It lifted similar to the blush when I tried to apply more. I did like that it had very slight cool tones so I could use as a contour and use my warmer putty bronzer as my bronzer. Not extremely pigmented like the blush which is a plus for me.Overall I probably wont use these products. I did give three stars bc it could be exactly what another person is looking for.",
