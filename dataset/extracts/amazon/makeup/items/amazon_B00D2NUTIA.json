It covers well enough to blend in and give the protection from the sun. i only need a little concealer with this foundation and I'm good to go. It's very good for my extremely sensitive skin. The price on Amazon is great.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this yesterday and received it today and I had to try it immediately. I have a ruddy complexion plus sensitive skin. on top of that, i had a face waxing and the wax was too hot and burned my skin. It was painful, red and peeling. I treated the burn but the mark will take awhile to go away. I tried this product after watching a video of a woman with blotchy skin use it. It worked on her so I bought it. And it was amazing. It is light, goes on smooth and easy, feels great and covers my red complexion and the burn. i showed my husband and he, who knows nothing about makeup, noticed that my skintone was even and smooth and not a mark on it. you had to look hard to see the burn marks. This product is cheaper than most other products that boast the same results, which is another plus for this makeup. I purchased the medium light color and it was a great match for my skin. I love the combination of the moisturizer, foundation, sun screen and face sponge. I can buy one product instead of four. it also did not irritate my sensitive skin.",

                "reviewText": "I have medium cool-neutral skin. I just received my 3rd shade, and have to conclude that there just isn\u2019t a match for me. I hate to say it because the formula is amazing. It goes on wet but dries down with no tackiness, and has a smooth finish. 260 is too dark for foundation, but makes a fabulous cream bronzer. It is a yellow-toned brown. 245 is too light for foundation and more \u2018beige\u2019 than \u2018warm\u2019, but makes a great under-eye concealer. I bought 255 thinking it would be the one, but it turns out both the undertone and depth of color are wrong. 255 is A LOT lighter than 260, and is peachy. I can\u2019t use it for anything. Hopefully I can find a similar product with a better range of shades.UPDATE:After seeing 240 Natural Beige in person, I noticed it has a peachier tone than 245 (my \u201cconcealer\u201d), so I bought it to see if the peach would better cancel out my under eye darkness. Now I\u2019m just confused at the shade range. 240 is closer to my color than any of the shades I\u2019ve tried. I figured the smaller the number, the lighter the shade\u2026but 255 Soft Honey was far too light for my face, while 240 is a pretty good match for foundation. I would highly recommend looking at these in person, because not one of these shades has been what I expected based on photos OR user demonstrations.",

It will cling more heavily in some areas then others on my skin, no matter how much I try to smooth and blend it with the enclosed sponge, or my foundation brush.Waste of my money. Since it is too dark for my skin, I will be tossing it, or give to someone who does not mind that I used it once. Will not buy again!!!",
