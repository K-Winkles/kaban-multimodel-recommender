                "reviewText": "Decent lip tint+oil.1. I took a 3 pics- right after applying, 30min after, 1hr later.2. This didnt stay long enough for me but I dont mind reapplying in frequently. I move my lips and talk alot so... For the price, I didnt expect much anyway so it is ok, I can work with it.3. It didnt tint my lips as I wished but still left a nice sheer of color on my natural, colorless lips. Im contented.4. Very light, minimum stickiness, gives a nice shine when you apply it. Not sticky like lip gloss.5. It dried out my lips but maybe it is just me. All the lip tints that Ive ever tried in the past, all of them dried my lips out as time went by.6. Quantity is very little but it is only $6 so it is understandable. But it is nice to carry it with me everywhere since it is very small.7. I ordered something 'mauve' and it looks exactly same as shown in picture. Love it.8. Only down side is applicator. Tiktok made me buy it and when I saw it from Tiktok, the applicator was big but the one that I got, it has a small thin regular applicator head so I had to apply it few times to cover whole my lips.9. Worth to buy it for $6",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit concerned that the Berry Queen would look too purple, but also knew I needed a bit of that for my cool complexion. It's a strong color but it's controllable so I dap some off after applying and leaving for a moment.I use a little on my cheeks too when I am using on my lips. It does stain tho so blend out ASAP.I love stains most for my needs and this Elf one as been a godsend as it's not as drying as any I've used before. I also love the Power Mauve, tho I do not feel it looks the same on me as any examples I've seen. It almost looks a bit peachy and far less blue than \"Mauve\" should be and a little lighter than I expected (again, on me at least).My lips have a more blue/soft mauve tint naturally. Mauve-like colors are what I've learned to look for, so this Berry Queen has the right amount of blue to really complement and not look out of place.I do find this color to be buildable, but the color will wear down a bit to a more subtle \"stain\" and need more applications to keep bold. Worth it for me because I can't keep lip color on my lips to save my life.Side note: I'm all about French aesthetics and being as natural as possible/enhancing natural beauty. So if this is your thing, you may very much enjoy one of these stains!Reason for my 4 vs 5 stars: I like the applicator, but the packaging is so freaking wasteful. It's my primary gripe with Elf in general. If I can find a clean beauty product that works the same (even if at a somewhat higher price point) with less waste, I will switch. I think they could do better.",

The color remains once the gloss wears off or is blotted off via tissue.Color-wise:Pinkies Up- I was expecting this to be a cool pink, but this is has much more brown in it than the promotional photos show. Not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting!Power Mauve- this was my favorite of the pair I ordered. On me, it is more bold, and a blue-reddish hue without being RED. For someone who doesn\u2019t wear red, this would be my alternative, and the color that is left as the stain is very pretty.For context I am fair with cool pink-red coloring",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve become driven to try and find other lipsticks and stains that might be superior to what I currently use. Since this product was all over social media.. I thought I\u2019d give it a try for a more undefined lip alternative.I find it didn\u2019t work for me. The stain effect works\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t stay consistent all over my lips as the day goes on. And I hate to have to reapply. So\u2026 if you are fine with reapplication - it\u2019s good. The color I chose comes out as a berry .. dark pinky/red/ purple color which is super pretty on. Natural looking with just a slight pop of vibrancy.",

                "reviewText": "I bought three of these to add to one I received with Boxycharm. This color stays on, no joke. I tried removing with cold cream in an attempt to view all three colors on my lips, and it was difficult, if not impossible to remove. Love the colors as well. I find they don't dry out my lips nearly as much as other lip stains I have and like. Can't believe they're under $10. I guess some people would complain about the size, but I don't wear the same shade of lipstick everyday so I'm ok with it.",

But not with these. They\u2019re scent-free and light with a great color pay off. The Spicy Sienna colour is lovely. It stains the lips in minutes to a nice though less vibrant natural but totally wearable pink that goes well even with a darker natural lip tone. Think \u201cyour lips but better.\u201d Once your lips are stained, you\u2019re able to use lip balm over it. The only downside is that it doesn\u2019t last very long. I don\u2019t think I used it for up to a month before it was finished.",
