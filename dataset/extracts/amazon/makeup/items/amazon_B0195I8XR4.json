                "reviewText": "I purchased these for a business trip. They are soft, a thicker material than the average ones/generic ones on shelves, great for my sensitive skin and had a low scent. The downfalls are that they dried out after 3 days of opening and closing the packaging. The adhesive on the packaging was really nice so I was surprised they dried out. I don't wear a ton of make up but still needed about 3 to remove my make up before cleansing my face. These are great in a pinch and light weight for traveling! Would also be great in your handbag.",
