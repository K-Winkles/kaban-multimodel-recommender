It's been my goal to find cleaner makeup products so I'd decided to try something else. I hadn't seen this product before, but when I searched setting sprays, I found it, liked the price, and I trust nyx, so I ordered it. The reviews warned of it being pretty matte if used as a primer and setting spray, so I was a little worried because I'm a dry skin girl. I have used it as a primer and setting spray and think it's pretty great! I haven't felt too dry or matte, but all the products I use are moisturizing because of my skin type, so that may be why this product is a success for me. It works great and Yuka says it's pretty clean, so it's a win for me!",

                "reviewText": "I love this. The fact that it's a primer and a setting spray is a game changer. Less to put in my makeup bag. And on top of that, you can even use it to refresh your makeup throughout the day and/ or night. It does exactly as it says in that it gives your face a natural finish, which is wonderful for me! I give this a 10/10 and would definitely recommend. Would buy again whenever it runs out; you get a decent size bottle and you don't need a lot. It is not sticky and it has a light scent, kinda floral which is fine with me being I'm not sensitive to smells. Again, I love that it gives me a natural finish to my face!!",
