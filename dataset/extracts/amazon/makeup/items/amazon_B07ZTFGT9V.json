You have to rub it pretty hard and by that point, your brush is all messed up and you can\u2019t even get the product on. I restored to rubbing my finger in there to warm up the product then smearing it onto my brow and using the brush to help style it the way I wanted but even that didn\u2019t work out very well. The balm was just so dry. It could have been that the ones I got were just bone dry but I don\u2019t know.",
