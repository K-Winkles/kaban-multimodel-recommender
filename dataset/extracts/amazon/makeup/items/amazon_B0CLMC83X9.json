It looked like I had a pound of chalky makeup plastered everywhere I had applied it.My skin was well prepped as always. I use no powders. Applied thinly and blended it out well.I literally just threw it away after I had to use two rounds of cleansing balm to get it off. After reapplying skin care my undereyes still look a little dehydrated.",
