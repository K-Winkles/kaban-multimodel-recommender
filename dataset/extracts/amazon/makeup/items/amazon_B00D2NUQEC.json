                "reviewText": "I use shade 245, warm beige, and it is perfect for my light olive skin tone (Native American and Irish heritage). This makeup blends effortlessly for a smooth finish and flawless complexion. I usually use the application pad that comes with it and it works just fine in my opinion. For best results I use a light handed application. If you use too much it will make you look older. I find very little is needed to give the results I want. This makeup wears well all day, only needing an occasional touch up if I blow my nose. It feels very moist when going on, almost wet feeling, but this is what makes it good for aging skin. My face tends to be drier than it was in my 20s and 30s (mid 40s now) but this makeup keeps it looking plump and is non-drying. I do not feel like I am wearing makeup when I have this on. I love that it is easily found in many stores and here on Amazon. One compact lasts me about 2 months, using it often but not daily. It is always what I grab when I want to look my best. I definitely recommend and will purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "I just thought I'd give this a try. It has turned out to be THE BEST foundation I've EVER purchased! Let my youngest daughter (17) try some. She loved it so I gave it to her. I ordered 2 colors to see which would match my skin tone. Gave her the lighter shade and it matched her skin tone just right!I can't rave about this product enough. Helps cover skin discoloration, goes on smooth (I use a dampened makeup sponge to apply), and it looks great on my matured skin. I'm a little over 50. My skin has changed. This has great coverage, doesn't increase the look of wrinkles/crows feet, and doesn't cake on. The coverage it amazing! Not too little, not too much but can layer or use more if needed. I have this on auto ship every 4 months.",
