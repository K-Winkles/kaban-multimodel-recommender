                "reviewText": "I ordered the colors Glistening Peach and Sparkling Rose, and they both give me a beautiful natural look! I prefer the sparkling rose, only becausw it is darker, and shows up more, but if you want a nice, natural, and healthy look, I would reccomend to go for Glistening peach! I love these because they are mini and bite-sized, and can be fit into a bag, and I love bringing it with me. I would not specifically say the blending it effortlessly, but it is not imposdible to blend. You just have to swipe a little bit on, and grab a big blush brush and blend it in. For people with dry skin, I would MUCH reccomend this over the powder blush. It makes less of a mess, and it does not dry out your skin like powder blushes can. I also love the shimmer it gives off. I glow on stage when I perform, and I don\u2019t get that with other blushes. The shade assortment may seem small, but I think they give great color choices for different skin tones. I always like smaller assortments of shades because larger to huge assortments can get overwhelming to the point when you don\u2019t know what shades even fit your tone. I would probably reccomend using these for blush only, but they are okay for eyeshadow and lipstick. But when you use it as lipstick, you have to be careful because the stick is a little too large, so you have got to be careful so you don\u2019t get it out of the lip line. Using it as eyeshadow however gives off a super similar feeling as creme shadow. It just depends what you prefer, but if you prefer powder eyeshadow, just use that, but if you prefer using a cream, I would recommend using this as an eyeshadow. Out of the two shades I purchased, I would reccomend using glistening peach for the eyes, and sparkling rose for the lips, but that is my personal opinion. If you prefer a bold eye and a more subtle lip, then I would recommend doing it the other way around or to purchase a darker color for the eyes. Overall, I would definitely reccomend using this, especially for blush, and I would like to order the rest of the collection to test out the colors and how they look on the eyes/lips/face. I would definitely reccomend it.",

They are pretty and light moist, and for a woman, my age to not go into creases. I also use some Trinny London much more expensive. All the other skincare products that I do use are from my doctor. I would say on a pinch especially if you\u2019re going on vacation try the elf even if you\u2019re not on vacation it\u2019s a fun make up I just wish that they would have more colors. They only have a few. They\u2019re OK for the lips but I do use a different lipstick. Sometimes they put a little bit of the glow on for a shine but other than that I use my Other lipsticks that I own.",

                "reviewText": "The e.l.f. Monochromatic Multi Stick in Dazzling Peony offers a convenient and versatile approach to adding color to eyes, lips, and cheeks. While its creamy and blendable texture is commendable, the overall performance leaves a bit more to be desired in terms of longevity and intensity.One of the notable positives of this multi stick is its luxuriously creamy consistency. Upon application, it glides smoothly onto the skin, making it easy to blend for a seamless and natural finish. The Dazzling Peony shade adds a soft, rosy hue that is universally flattering and suitable for various skin tones.The multipurpose aspect of this stick is appealing, allowing for quick and effortless application on different areas of the face. It's a handy tool for creating a cohesive and harmonious makeup look with minimal effort.However, the staying power of the color is where this multi stick falls a bit short. While the initial application is vibrant and fresh, the intensity tends to fade over time. Reapplication may be necessary for those looking to maintain a bold and noticeable color throughout the day.Additionally, the product's performance on the lips is adequate but may not meet the expectations of those seeking a long-lasting lip color. It imparts a subtle tint, but the need for frequent touch-ups may be a drawback for those with a preference for more enduring lip products.The packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, with a twist-up design that eliminates the need for sharpening. This adds to the convenience of on-the-go application but doesn't entirely compensate for the need for more prolonged color retention.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Monochromatic Multi Stick in Dazzling Peony is a decent addition to a makeup routine for its creamy texture and versatility. However, those desiring a longer-lasting and more intense color payoff may find themselves wanting more. While it offers a quick and easy solution for a touch of color, improvements in staying power would elevate its appeal.",

                "reviewText": "I have always heard good things about this brand, so I finally decided to try it ! Can't believe the price ! It is worth so much more than what you pay ! I love how it can be used for lips, cheeks, eyes ! Makes for a more uniform look - everything matches. I don't especially care to wear make up, but this product adds just a hint of color - makes me look pretty and alert - but looks natural, like I am not wearing anything at all. It fits in my pocket too ! Easy to bring along. I also appreciate the color chart on Amazon - shows all the colors on different skin tones, so my color decision was quite easy. I plan to get 1 or 2 more colors now, a little darker, or maybe more bronze for spring/summer. Thank you !",
