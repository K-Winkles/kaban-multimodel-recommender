It is a product worth buying especially if you get it on sale. I gave it four stars because it\u2019s not the holy Grail, but I was thinking it would be when I purchased it due to viral views.

                "reviewText": "This blends like butter into my cream foundation and cc cream. Its buildable so start light to find the look you hope to achieve. I have battled with this whole contour thing for years. I've tried pricey solid sticks, powders, and concealers but this budget friendly little guy beats them all! I should add that I don't use any type of powder on my face so I can't speak to how it will blend or look if powder is used.",

                "reviewText": "I have not been able to establish a satisfying relationship with a contour until now. In the winter I'm VERY fair, and my skin is neutral in tone and things seem to oxidize warm on me after application so finding makeup products that don't end up orangey or muddy or weird is an uphill process. This product, however, is a delight. No orange cast that makes it look like I'm trying too hard to look tan in winter, sheer and blendable as can be, the texture is really lovely and it carries just enough pigment to create the most natural shadow contour. The sponge tip offers more precision than any other product I've used, and the tiny hint of jowling I've developed is thankful for that; nothing's ever going to make it look like my jawline is snatched, but it makes it so that's not the first thing that draws the eye. Honestly, this product has impressed me so much that I'm really motivated to try the Halo Glow blush and highlighter as well.",

                "reviewText": "It's a bit challenging to blend this product without wiping it off. I'm still experimenting, and I think the trick will be to apply it in various places and then go back to blend it once it has 30 seconds or so to set first. I got this based on the positive reviews to see if I could find a less pricey alternative to Anastasia but I'll either try something else or go back to it. Also, as one reviewed posted in a pic, there's a weird connection between the tube and the sponge applicator that oozes a small amount of the product. Seems like poor packaging.In spite of all that, the fair/light color is great for my complexion because it provides a shadow without looking the least bit orange-toned.",

I expected to go though it very quickly but a little goes a long way. I have used it daily for 3 months now. I will definitely buy again. I love elf products and their halo glow line is a hit for me.",
