                "reviewText": "I finally used this product a month after receiving it due to my traveling. When I finally came home (for my birthday ) I decided this would be my go to makeup pallette. Now, I was scared because I chose a product I never used before over all of my products I already had and know what I can do with, but upon opening it the colors were vibrant and very pigmented. The lip gloss very rich in color. I decided to go with the reds and pinks. They were easily picked up by my brushes, the color was rich and when applied it was gorgeous. The color did not bush off onto my cheeks nor did I have to apply 50 million times just to get a darker shade. 2-3 coats is what I did to make the red bolder after blending. I am very satisfied and relieved that the eyeshadow are perfect. Not like cheaply made, in fact I can't recall having to wipe any makeup off my cheek from applying the eyeshadow. I'm grateful for that. I tried the lip gloss also. It's really something I would let my baby nieces play with as the color gives you a \"kool-aid\" stain. Wears off after like an hour. I'd pair it for the sheen with a lipstick the same shade but it's not pigmented enough to wear on itself. I did not used the brush applicators that come with it as I have makeup brushes already but am sure if you use it the makeup will come on very easily. None of that \"digging \" effects . All in all I'm happy with this product. What I really like though, an was surprised, is the size of it. It's very small like a Pandora box but it spreads out to look bigger but it was great because I popped the box into one of my bigger purses and carted it with me in case of reapplication. I was expecting it to be large so this is a good surprise. It's not heavy also. It has A lock on the top that after a few locking/unlocking it doesn't stick as much. Now I can easily lock it without having to chip a nail to get it to. I think it's just because it hasn't been used you have get it into motion. Would be awesome if the blushes were also attached to make this more of a complete look but all in all its ok. I give this a thumbs up for its price and quality. And no I am not paid to write a review, I bought this product based on everyone else's and hoped they told the truth. Thank you because this is definitely going to be one of my go to palletes",
