        "description": "How to use lip gloss Oil: 1. Gently apply a thick lip gloss on the entire lip with your fingers to create a plump and full lip shape. The key point is that when the lips are parted, the lip gloss does not accumulate in the corners of the lips. 2. Draw a rounded outline with a lip liner in advance to create a soft impression. Then use a lip brush to apply a gold or pearlescent lip gloss all over the lips for a luxurious look. 3. Use transparent lip gloss. Use fingertips to apply lip gloss and pat onto lips. The key to smearing is to open your lips and not let the lip gloss accumulate at the corners of the lips. It is best to use a lip brush to apply some lip gloss on the inside of the lips.",
