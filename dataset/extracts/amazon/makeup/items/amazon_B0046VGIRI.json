I wear it alone and the full coverage is amazing. My daughter said it doesn't even look like I have on make-up. Her words, \"Mom, it just make you look more chocolate.\" When I want that flawless appeal , I grab my cocoa concealer and dab it right on top of my spots and under my eyes. I then pat the product into my skin ( never on my entire face). The results are practically non-detectable and plesantly beautiful. After wearing for hours ( from sun up to sun down) my skin still looks good without that ashy look. I've even worn it to sleep and from my observation, the concealer has made my dark spots lighter. Grab yours today, I promise you're gonna love it!",

                "reviewText": "If I were to apply only one beauty product before leaving the house, it would be concealer. My undereyes and my eyelids are so prone to dark shadowy-ness that I swear it looks like I have a penchant for punching myself in the face as part of my morning routine. If I want to run down the street in the morning to grab a coffee, I either need to put on concealer or wear sunglasses, or I fear that small children will run away from me, screaming in terror, convinced that they just saw a real life zombie coming out of their local Starbucks.As a result of my unrelenting dark circles, concealer and I have a very intimate relationship. I swear that I have tried EVERY concealer and eye brightener that any magazine, beauty blog, or friend has ever recommended. YSL Touche Eclat, Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage, Lancome Effacernes, Benefit Boi-ing, Smashbox Photo Op, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Tarte....okay, I'm going to stop naming concealers I've tried because this is actually getting really depressing and kind of shameful. The point is, out of ALL of the concealers I've tried, this Maybelline one is my favorite.I realize that my dedication to this concealer, out of all the concealers in the world, is kind of weird and random, but I freaking love this product and I've been using it for years now. Actually, I take that back. I kind of hate this product - I would love to not be shackled to my drug-addict-like attachment to concealer. And no, it doesn't work miracles, my eye circles are still the bane of my facial existence. (Yes, I know, my life is SO hard.) But regardless, this concealer is the best one I've got.Sometimes I'll get curious and try something else, but I always come back to this. It's not too sheer but not too thick, it's not sticky, and it doesn't crease (especially not if I set it with a tiny bit of Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder). This concealer comes in many different shades (sometimes I go lighter or darker based on the time of year, or mix a pink-based hue with a yellow-based hue.) It lasts a really long time, it's inexpensive (especially if you buy it online), and it doesn't irritate my usually-sensitive skin.The wand applicator is great. I've found that most concealers that have a similar consistency to this one are packaged so that you have to click a button or knob on a pen-like contraption in order to dispense more of the product, and then oftentimes too much concealer blobs out at once and you end up wasting it (which is especially annoying when you are dealing with a very expensive concealer).Several of my friends have started using this concealer based on my rave reviews (and this is probably also a good indication that my dark circles do in fact look far less horrifying once I have applied this product).",

My wife said she loves it for its lightness and ability to blend with her skin. On the other hand, she noticed that the outfit is not great all day long.She says for the price, it's a good deal. It conceals quite a bit, although it's not the best concealer she's used. She advises using a primer before concealer and touching up if necessary. A little setting powder and that's it. The applicator is easy to use and the 6 ml lasts quite a long time. The variety of shades is a big plus. For those with oily skin, she recommends preparing the skin well beforehand. And for more coverage, she suggests mixing it with another product that's a little thicker.",
