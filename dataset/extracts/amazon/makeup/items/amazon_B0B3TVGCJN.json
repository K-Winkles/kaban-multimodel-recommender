                "reviewText": "This is the best cheap pricepoint cream/liquid contour product I've used. Im a product junkie (especially with makeup & skincare) and this stuff is better than most of my $40 contouring products. It's the perfect amount of coverage; translucent enough for daytime wear yet also buildable enough for nighttime makeup looks.Downside: It can cause foundation flaws if not applied correctly. Blend immediately upon application (don't allow it to dry before blending) & use light pressure with a non-dense, feathery brush.",

It does dry a little fast so blend right after application but otherwise amazing product and worth the money. No annoying scent and easy to apply with applicator.",

That's why the cool shades of this look sooooooooooo good. The applicator is perfect too. I've been using this on my cheekbones, nose, and even a little on my eyelid for that almond/cat eye shape. Great formula, blends out nice with a beauty blender.And yes, you can use a warmer shade as a BRONZER to warm up the face. Two very different objectives. This formula was GREAT for that. :)",

I love my fenty stick in amber, but it is so expensive and I just couldn't justify purchasing it right now, so I decided that I would order this. The color match is AWESOME. Perfect for super pale me. I also love easily it blends and how freaking chiseled I feel like it makes me. It is the best and my new holy grail---for much cheaper than the holy grail it is replacing.",
