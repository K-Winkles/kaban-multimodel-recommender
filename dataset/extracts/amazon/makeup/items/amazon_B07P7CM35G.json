                "reviewText": "I was recently attacked by an animal in the face and had a dozen stitches. I've purchased a lot of different concealers to cover the scar up until it's mature enough for plastic surgery. I've purchased cheaper brands, and more expensive brands, like Mac etc. So far this has worked the best. I bought some more colors so I can color match in different lighting. Super surprised with the coverage, you wouldn't notice the scar unless you knew to look in that specific area. I don't know how it works on acne scarring, but my stitches only came out about 5 weeks ago and it's covering it super well.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Is like a designer make up product and is amazing",
                "reviewText": "I love the elf brand products because they offer the same quality that high-end premium products offer. I am a former professional make up artist and are usually use only premium make up brands. For example, some of the brands that I have are make up forever, Mac, Lancome, Christian Dior, Trish McVoy, Bobby Brown, and the Sephora brand. I love finding make up that works, and that changes the way you feel. Most cheap brands of make up the ones that you find at the drugstore don\u2019t offer the same smooth and glowing appearance that a premium brand does. I have never bought concealer from the drugstore. I would find that the concealer would either be too thick and application was difficult due to the fact it would end up looking cakey, would not blend smoothly so you could see the parts that I applied it too so much that it was very obvious that I had makeup on, it wouldn\u2019t offer full coverage or even coverage that could hide imperfections such as redness around the nose and or dark circles. The color options at the drugstore were limited or were not good for someone who has yellow undertones. It would offer beige, pink or dark undertones but they were never similar to a real skin tone. It would either be too light or too dark or have too much beige. I have scarring on my face and body. The scars usually required me to apply thick, cakey, concealers that rubbed off onto clothing, gave skin a plastic fake looking appearance and difficult to apply. They also were expensive and I always had to reapply them during the day because they rubbed off onto everything. This concealer is waterproof (I can take a shower and it doesn\u2019t rinse off, I can get into the water and swim and it doesn\u2019t budge, it is sweat proof, lasts 24 hours, is the only concealer I have found this year that I can use on my body and it doesn\u2019t transfer to my clothes. The fact that it is TRULY transfer proof is such a huge solution for me as I can now apply it to my scars on the chest and neck and arms and I have never gotten any stains from it. I can rub it with my hands, use a cloth to see if it rubs off it doesn\u2019t. It does require a makeup remover because it\u2019s almost semi permanent and requires special cleansing to remove completely. You need to have a concealer brush that is high quality to use for application because it will apply very thickly if you use the included sponge application brush. It dries almost immediately so you need to start with very little product and carefully layer it so that you don\u2019t over apply. It is not a concealer that offers a completely, natural, no makeup look. I have yet to find one that does. But this concealer does exactly what it\u2019s advertised to do. It is cheaper than most drugstore brands but when you research best makeup brands ELF is consistently on the list as a brand that offers designer, premium quality products, that mimic and even beat the premium expensive brands. What\u2019s great is that you can rely on the entire product line to cover all your makeup needs. I can go to Walgreens, skip the multiple aisles of drugstore makeup brands (don\u2019t even have to look at the new makeup featured) I just go to the ELF aisle. I am able to buy concealer, mascara, eyeliner, blush, eyebrow pencil, eyeshadow, makeup removers, makeup brushes, and it offers a good selection of primers that you can experiment with. I am able to spend under $100 and be able to put together a huge makeup kit. When I lost my huge, expensive special makeup kit (I have different kits for certain situations) I was so upset. I had spent over $600 on the makeup in that kit, I had makeup that I saved up for and most of the makeup was $50-$150 dollars per item. I had spent a ridiculous amount of time researching, saving up and trying out all the makeup in that lost kit. I also had a huge event I was attending where I was going to be photographed and representing a new business. So I almost skipped going because I didn\u2019t have time to get a professional makeup appointment (realized the kit was missing a few hours before event) no one was available on such short notice (Ulta, Sephora, Nordstroms makeup brand selections were all required to be booked in advance (I tried MAC, Christian Dior, Lanc\u00f4me, Jean Juarez salon, Ulta in store makeup appointments were the same ) so I had to go to the drugstore for makeup or beg my mom to let me borrow hers. I went to store. I had read reviews from (makeup Alley, Ulta, new beauty & Allure to name a few, regarding drugstore makeup products that were as good as premium makeup) Elf was mentioned multiple times. So I went to the aisle and bought multiple options of concealers (3 different colors) all of the primers, 3 shades of blush, two mascara types, eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara, makeup remover for facial skin, and then I got a concealer brush, angled blush brush, foundation application brush, makeup sponge that could be used for all areas of face, eye lash curler. I couldn\u2019t believe how cheap the makeup was (it is like Wet N Wild pricing but should be considered underpriced for the quality you get) my husband was really annoyed and concerned when he saw how full my cart was, I filled up an entire basket. He said it\u2019s going to cost me $300 at least. Then I said let\u2019s see. Went to the register and we both left the store in shock because I probably had purchased products that were worth $400 (yes makeup can easily add up to that amount especially when your buying all new stuff) but it cost us $120 dollars and we purchased over 20 items. I am hoping you try the concealer it is so cheap you can\u2019t afford not to buy it and I recommend buying a few different shades of the concealer because you can mix them to match your skin tone perfectly and our skin color changes during the year. So try it! It\u2019s a safe bet.",

I worked outside all day, sweating. It never creased! I\u2019m middle aged and normally concealer gets into the fine line around my eyes and accentuates those lines. Obviously, that\u2019s not what anyone wants. This concealer stays put and I am so impressed!One thing I want to echo from other reviewers: try to match the color of the bottle, not the swatch provided (or even the name). I am fair skinned and would normally never have \u201cmedium\u201d in the description of my concealer, powder, or foundation. But here we are-\u201cmedium neutral\u201d is my perfect match. I just love this product!",

They're so great for the price- great coverage + a little goes a long way! I use \"deep olive\" as my undereye concealer & \"rich ebony\" to contour & they do not disappoint! They do dry fast so you don't need to let them set (before blending with your beauty blender) as long as you let other concealers set. They're thick & creamy, however not too thick, and blends easily! They are a bit richer in color (for woc) than a lot of other more affordable concealers on the market, and the range is absolutely beautiful! Definitely recommend for beginners & those more experienced!",
