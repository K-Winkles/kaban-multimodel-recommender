The first palette I ordered had broken colors. I have no idea why a product like this, especially one with a mirror, would be packaged in an envelope instead of bubble wrap and a box - as I saw the Amazon delivery person toss the second envelope onto my cement porch. I had no problem with the return/exchange, except for the inconvenience of running to Kohls then waiting for the next one to arrive.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased so many eyeshadow pallettes the last few years, trying to find something similar to the pallette I've been using far too long.I loved the colors in this pallette, but didn't want to spend $40+ on yet another pallette I might not use. Then it went on sale!I was so excited when I got it, but didn't have an occasion to wear eyeshadow for a couple of weeks.Finally, I opened it and noticed the writing on the side telling me what to use where...perfect for someone like me that doesn't use makeup a lot.The shadows glided on. They felt so soft, and I didn't feel like I had to grind the shadow onto my eyelids. The colors layer easily. I didn't feel like I had to put on 5 lbs of shadow to get a good color.The shimmers are gorgeous! They add a soft shimmery look, but not glittery. The darker colors look so pretty, but I haven't been brave enough to try them yet.I'm 47, with sensitive skin and rosacea. This eyeshadow didn't crease or settle into my wrinkles. It didn't irritate my eyes either. One of my favorite things that I noticed, is that the color stays where you put it. I didn't have eyeshadow dust settle in my cheeks or under my eyes.I highly recommend this product!!",
