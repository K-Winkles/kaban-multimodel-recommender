                "reviewText": "This cleanser works faster than the regular brush cleaner I have. The magic must be because of the oils. It does really well at getting the makeup that's worked it's way deep into the bristles. My foundation brush is especially difficult to clean because of the nature of the foundation (it's designed to stay put, and it takes that role seriously), but this cleanser seeps down into the mess and breaks it down so it can be rinsed away so much easier.I always use a scrub mat (it's technically a shallow scrub bowl) to help in working out the makeup and dirt, and I used it with this cleanser as well. I also gave my brushes a quick rinse with my gentle face wash after cleaning them with this cleanser. I probably didn't need to do this, but as someone who has a tendency to break out easily, I was worried about the oil sitting on the bristles.",
