                "reviewText": "Usually I don't have many reasons to purchase concealer because my face didn't have many blemishes and my under eye area only needed a medium-full coverage foundation. By mishap and misfortune, after I just hit the good age of 31, my face broke out in so many different ways that I didn't feel comfortable without a mask-on or any make foundation. My skin was purging from a new skin cleanser I was trying out and whole bunch of new blemish issues that I have never dealt with before came into play.After all that, I decided to look into a good light concealer to wear under my foundation. I tried and E.l.f concealer in the past but it was a bit oily and was sort of slippery to cover and blemishes. With NYX as my next quality, go-to drugstore brand, I decided to take a look into this concealer knowing about its fantastic reviews.Most of the time, I like to buy my make-up in stores for the best color match because each brand has their own variation of color wheels. I wasn't in much of a mood to go to Ulta or Target and browse all day, so I just decided to take a gander at the swatch reference they have along with this concealer's post. I went with a Neutral Tan (I use E.l.f's flawless foundation in Honey, a tan with neutral undertones) because it looked closest to my foundation. I even tried to go a bit lighter since the winter months have just passed by and I have been staying indoors most days. Goodness, I must have been thrown off by the word \"neutral\" because when I tested it out upon it's arrival, it wasn't a neutral tone at all; it is more along a warmer yellow tone. My skin tone runs from medium-to medium dark, depending on the season and my veins peep through as green, so I claim that I am an olive tone. With the fight between warm or cool/ yellow or pink tones in my life, the invention of \"neutral\" undertones really made me feel like I finally found make-up in exact shades of my skin; and because of the word \"neutral\" in this concealer, I thought it would be a closer match than what I expected, but I used to choose warmer foundations in the past, so I just went with it.Nonetheless, the concealer itself is a very, very, very good product; lightweight with buildable coverage. Like described, it has a satiny texture and is slightly matte and when you smooth it on your skin, you can barely feel that it's on face. Some of the blemishes on my face are somewhat dark, and with a good dot of product, it lighten it up pretty well. With a second dot, it can cover it completely. With regular mask usage, it lasts just about the same as my foundation; rubbing off here and there, with the blemishes looking like it had naturally faded.Also, this is definitely a concealer that takes care of the undereye area, making it look like there aren't any dark circles or bags.Definitely love this product and will look into trying the other shades to find my exact match.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really good concealer when you are looking for a full coverage option, that will look great and stay put all day, without breaking the bank. I wouldn't say that its high enough quality to compete with the heavy hitters like Shape Tape, Milk, or Bo-ingg, but among drugstore brands, this concealer is definitely at least in the top tier. They offer a pretty decent range of shades to help you match with your skin tone, in cooperation with theor coordinating foundation shades. It applies really easily and blends like a dream, especially using a damp beauty blender. I will say it is a pretty small little vial, and the applicator takes up a decent portion of the tube I'm sure, so you aren't getting very much product, but the price is fairly reasonable so I guess that's sort of the give and take. I usually bake it in with setting powder and I find that the coverage is pretty full without looking cakey, plus it lasts through a long shift or all day outing.I like it and think it's definitely worth a try if you want a very inexpensive but full coverage and easy to work with concealer. I'm sure that like everything, it lends itself much better to different skin types and tones. I have rather oily skin with a lot of redness and uneven texture. I am also very fair and cool toned. I use the shade \"vanilla.\"",

                "reviewText": "This has a fairly thick texture, and even when I use the tiniest amount, I have a terrible time trying to get it to blend in. It looks blotchy and is so difficult to spread. The color is the right shade of green to neutralize the redness in my skin, so the color is great. I can't figure out how to actually use this product, though, since no matter how much I moisturize my skin or how little of the green product I use, I can't get it to blend in. Maybe I'm using it wrong?",

Every concealer with eventually crease throughout the day but this one was significantly less and the coverage is very good.",
