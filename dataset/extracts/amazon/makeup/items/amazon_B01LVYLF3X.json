I would recommend putting on a primer first to hold the color longer. It does not last as long as some other stick shadows I have tried.

I was able to get a close look at it, and I was immediately disappointed with the color \"mixture.\" The item I selected wouldn't have worked for me, regardless of any other issue.I've been curious about these eyeshadow sticks for a long time. I wanted to test them out years ago, but they seemed kind of pricey for my budget. I don't like to spend more than I'm used to on an item I have no certainty will work as claimed. But then my friend told me she bought a stick on discount, and it was a game changer for her. (Easy to use, easy to blend, buildable color, quick application, lasts long, looks natural, etc.) She said she bought more and suggested I at least try one. She insisted they were worth the regular price... finding one on discount was just a bonus. We're very much alike in what we look for in beauty cosmetics, so I was intrigued. I also saw there were a ton more reviews on Amazon than the last time I checked, and the majority of them seemed highly positive. So, I went for it. I felt I had the amount of guarantee I needed to justify testing this thing out.I got the sheer shimmery pink color to use as a highlighter and on the inner corner of my eyes for a brightening effect. But that's not going to happen now. After I received my used product, I took a closer look at the reviews on Amazon - mostly to see if anyone mentioned unexpected problems with the same color I ordered. Instead, I noticed there were quite a bit of people who received what appeared to be used products, too!This is highly disappointing considering this brand seemed to have made a good name for itself over the last few years. I was really excited to finally try their infamously convenient and water-resistant eyeshadow stick. You'd think they'd be more careful about the products they're sending out - especially for what they're charging.My eyeshadow stick was undoubtedly used before I received it. Box was slightly crushed with signs of having been opened. The tip of the eyeshadow was smudged and there was product smeared on the outside of the barrel. If all that wasn't proof enough, the sponge tip had makeup residue on it as if someone fully tried every part of this thing out.I can't speak for the application and wear quality of the item because I'm not willing to risk transferring potential bacteria to my eyes, face, or even the back of my hand. I can say the expectation of the product was not met, right off the bat. I can also add that I was surprised that there looked to be big chunks of glitter in the shimmery sheer pink eyeshadow and on the sponge tip. (I wasn't expecting such large specks of actual GLITTER to be in the mix. It wasn't shown on the advertised photos or explicitly stated that cheap glitter would be used. I did expect some fine mineral-like shimmer, but not cheap glitter.)I'd suggest that if you buy this product, you thoroughly inspect it upon receiving it. Having cosmetics melt or break during shipment is one thing. But being sold a used product (advertised as new) is absolutely unacceptable. Especially, when there's evidence of it be a reoccurring issue for this particular product.I'm debating whether or not I want to try ordering another color - only because my friend was raving about this eyeshadow like it was the best product she has found to date. If I do decide to take another chance, I'd likely play it safe and choose a matte shade. I can handle some amount of \"shimmer,\" but I feel I'm a bit too old and I don't get dressed up enough to decorate my eyes with glitter. (I cannot stress enough: This was straight up large specks of GLITTER - almost like you'd find in a craft store or in young teens' cheap & trendy makeup - mixed in with an otherwise nice looking shimmery/pearlescent color.)I'm just worried I'll get another used product... or that the product was otherwise kept in unsanitary/uncertain conditions before I received it. I just don't understand how this issue could happen so often. (Search thru the product reviews for yourself and count the number of complaints. You may not find it to be excessive, but I do. It really should be more of a rare occurrence. I haven't found this many complaints of used/questionable products when researching other cosmetics I'm also interested in trying.)Also, avoid the shimmery sheer light pink color... unless you're ok with random large specks of glitter. Then maybe go for it. The overall main color appeared nice with some shimmer to it already.",

I love the lighter tones, and all in shimmer or metallic (no matte for me, thank you! I wear very minimal makeup and really enjoy the fun subtle sparkle on my lids). This goes on so easily, does not irritate the way that powder can, and honestly they're just such beautiful shades overall. I've made the mistake or purchasing a few dark ones that make my eyes look smaller (taupe, smoky grey), and also the meadow one which I really did not like; I was able to return these. But everything else I've tried has been gorgeous. I own at least 9 different ones now (Pearl, champagne, clove, honey gold, warm gold, sand, and more). LOVE LOVE LOVE :-))))",

                "reviewText": "If you are interested in this color just know it's a cool toned grey. It doesn't come up that color in the photos I tried to get so I didn't attach them. If you have brown toned skin just know it's not going to give a super dark black, or brown black or charcoal kind of a look. You'll get a soft mid tone cool grey. You can use it to achieve something like a smokey eye but it will be softer than what is likely your typical idea of a smokey eye. It's sort of a gun metal grey. Looks brown grey in the container and cool grey on the skin. I hope this helps.I'm giving 4 stars because it's not what I needed. It looks fine and it's workable. Smooth going on. Didn't irritate. But the product pictures don't make the color that it really is apparent.",
