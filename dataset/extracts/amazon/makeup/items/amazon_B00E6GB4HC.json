I used to use coconut oil due to the craze over it, but coconut oil leaves a oily film in my eye and creates a bit of blockage in my eyelids so I started to develop small cyst every so often. So I've been on a hunt for new makeup remover especially for my tough waterproof mascara! And this works great, I put some on some soft paper towel piece and put it over my eyes for 10-20 seconds and my mascara slides right off! And I don't have to wipe off any excess oil or residue from the makeup remover unlike coconut oil. The makeup remove dries down, doesn't irritate my eyes or cheeks (some products tend to make my cheeks burn). I remember buying this and I couldn't find it two weeks later and I immediately bought another bottle because I couldn't wait! So all in all, I really love this product!",

That said, it doesn't sting my eyes when I swipe the cotton pad across my eyes to remove shadow and under-eye concealer.But I've promoted it to \"Dry Winter Morning Facial Cleanser,\" since it is both gentle and cleansing at the same time. Isimply pour a moderate amount onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over my face, repeating with a second application if necessary, then rinsing with either a wash cloth or just plain splashing water. In milder, non-dry weather I want a little more thorough cleansing, I simply add a dollop of regular gentle facial cleanser (Cetaphil/Aquanil, Vanicream Gentle Foaming, CeraVe Foaming, Neutrogena Ultra, etc) and it cleanses well without drying out my skin at all.It IS, however, pricey. I could say a little goes a long way, but it doesn't. It's basically water with very mild detergents in it and it pours out like water. I usually use 2 applications. But I imagine nearly ever other makeup remover in the market could be used this way, most of them much cheaper than this one.",

I usually buy Lush's make up remover Ultrabland but I felt like I needed to cut my costs a bit. This stuff takes off my e.l.f. make up and Ruby Woo lipstick just great! I use it with a washable cloth and everything comes off! I don't have to rub too hard and I go over my make up twice at most to make sure everything is off.",

It's so gentle and removes makeup with just a gentle swipe - no scrubbing needed.My grandson uses black out stick on his face when he plays baseball, and practically shreds his skin to remove it. When i suggested he try my Chamomile remover he scoffed... until he tried it. Then he begged for me to get him a bottle of his own. Now that handsome face is clean and protected.",

I had gotten to the point where I only used tubing mascara so I wouldn't have to use anything on my eyes except water. This removes waterproof mascara and doesn't leave my face greasy like others. It also doesn't have a scent, which is a big plus. I use it on a microfiber face cloth to remove makeup.",
