It is buildable and can be full coverage if you want it to be. I have dark blond hair, blue eyes, and olive skin that tans easily, so honey medium is perfect for the summer. I\u2019ve used it for at least 10 years. I\u2019m now in my late 40\u2019s and this continues to be perfect for every concern I\u2019ve had. It does not settle into lines at all. I often use it as a standalone foundation on the weekend (w/concealer for under eye circles). I never use primer or setting powder or spray (which I know is bad!), so it works well without either.
