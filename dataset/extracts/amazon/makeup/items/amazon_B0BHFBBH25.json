                "reviewText": "I selected love cake matte, after much back and forth on what color to get. This is my second cream blush purchase (failed picking appropriate color last week, selecting from swatches online is tricky) and knew this time I needed to research a little. I searched for swatch images of love cake, devoted, hush hush, and rose ritual. I was aiming for a natural look and settled on love cake. I feel the pictured swatches for this product are accurate. I am brunette with green eyes and fair/light medium neutral skin. I am very pleased with the color! When this little gem arrived, I immediately liked the packaging. The box was sealed in a plastic bag and the box was taped shut (manufacturer fancy circle tape, not office tape). The box was cute too! The product itself had another adhesive strip on the cap and lower portion. This is all important because I don\u2019t want to use already used blush and I bet you don\u2019t either. If all that wasn\u2019t done, I would\u2019ve guessed the blush was already used because the applicator is already covered in blush. I guess I thought it would need to be primed but not the case. The product packaging is really high quality for the price. Looks fancy! I ran out of cheek heat (maybelline) and loathed the product packaging. It was messy and wasteful because too much would come out or none at all, then a lot, and it was all on my fingers and stained them because if I put it directly on a brush it was hard to accurately place and ugh. Color pigment was very good though. This applicator for sheglam is excellent. No waste. No messy fingers. Precise application. Blend with brush. Good to go. Highly pigmented. A little goes a long way. It\u2019s liquid so don\u2019t spill that cute fancy container! Blends well with brush to a natural finish. Longevity of wear is good. I feel quantity is fair according to price. I\u2019m interested to see how long it lasts me. I\u2019ll repurchase and I\u2019m eyeballing the sheglam contour creams for my next purchase. And I do love cake!",

                "reviewText": "This blush is so nice I decided to get a second color. It goes on easily and you only need a little to get a nice pop of color. It\u2019s matte which is getting harder to find lately. The applicator is my favorite part. The little sponge tip is a fun and different way to apply blush. It seems to last most of the day but it\u2019s usually faded by then end of my day. All in all I think it\u2019s a great product at a great price.",
