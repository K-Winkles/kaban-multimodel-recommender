                "reviewText": "I've been using the e.l.f. Total Face makeup brush for a few weeks. I specifically typed in \"powder brush\" to find this e.l.f. brush. The bristles are really soft, and feel good on my face compared to other brushes I have used, which feel prickly. It has wide enough bristles to cover my whole face and neck with about 8-9 brush strokes, and I'm done! I haven't seen any stray bristles falling out on my skin either, so I think it's very well-made. You can't beat the price at $3.00! I use my Total Face brush with Physicians Formula Mineral Wear powder, and I get a nice, even airbrush-like look and feel to my skin. The handle is smooth, a good length to hold on to, and fits in my makeup bag. I am fairly new to using powder makeup, but I seem to have hit a winner with this e.l.f. brush! It's a great brush for anyone to try. I got a great brush for little money...win-win! (Don't let the secret out! \ud83d\ude09).",
