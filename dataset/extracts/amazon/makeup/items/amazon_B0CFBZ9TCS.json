                "reviewText": "I wanted to update my makeup and I heard good things about this brand and thought I would give it a try. I like that it comes as a combo but over all I was not really that impressed with the highlight powder, bronzer and blush.I use a light coverage CC cream daily and I just wanted something to 'glam it up' a little. But what I got was not what I was going for.It looked heavy on my skin - the blush made me look 'clownish' and created a harsh line that didn't want to blend- I had to dab my face with a washcloth too get it to tone down.The highlighter is pretty, but be careful where you put it - too much on the forehead and you will look like a lighthouse. And the bronzer - had me looking all 2001 - back when bronzer first hit the scene and everyone looked sunburned, terra cotta, or burnt orange. Yes - that's what I looked like. So be feather light with your application to avoid these mishaps.The eye shadows are pretty and I do use those, but they would be better off in a smaller size on their own or add a couple more. I know they are heavily pigmented but they are very small. Especially when compared to the negative space left in the pallet. Yes, I saw the photo - it gives the illusion that you are getting a lot - it's bulky for that reason. There's enough room for 2 more powders or more eye shadows, easily.Overall - I doubt I will purchase any more products from this brand before I see it or sample it first.",

The eye shadows alone might be okay but no\u2026 overall, I was very disappointed and am sending it back.",
