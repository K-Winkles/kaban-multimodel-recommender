                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is truly the best foundation in all respects!",
                "reviewText": "First off let me share with you: I am a retired Executive for the largest food & drink sector in the world, thus I am a stickler regarding exceptional quality in the products I use. I am also a self taught \u201camateur\u201d skin, makeup, hair & beauty artist of over 5 decades, thus I only utilize exceptional quality products on my face, body & hair. This product is literally everything you\u2019d want in a foundation; as it is lightweight, moisturizing, it covers most imperfections efficiently, it doesn\u2019t have a lingering fragrance, it doesn\u2019t settle into pores, fine lines or wrinkles, it has all day staying power, (8-12 hours), the price is very competitive, & it lasts much longer, (I purchase every 2 months on average), than most foundation\u2019s! What more could a lady ask for in a full coverage foundation? This foundation is a spray, yet with all products you must know \u201chow to use them\u201d in order for them to do what they were created to for you, right? My Instructions: take an empty toilet paper cardboard, (YES I SAID TOILET PAPER CARDBOARD \ud83d\ude09), place your foundation brush inside it, be sure that the brush side is down into the toilet paper roll aprox. 2\u201d & then shake your foundation to mix it for aprox. 10 seconds & spray into the toilet paper roll hitting the top of your foundation brush, covering it with a light coat of foundation. \u201cVoila\u201d no mess, no wasted makeup & all the foundation ends up on your foundation brush where it\u2019s supposed to be! Hints: if you\u2019re a finely aged lady like I am, wet your foundation brush with a little warm water prior to spraying foundation into the brush ,(as described above). After spraying foundation on warmly dampened brush apply to face gently. When applying to pores, line lines &/or wrinkles take a different makeup brush, (small flatter brush) & rub it over your used foundation brush, (that you just applied foundation to your face with). Now, continuously dap this brush into fine lines, pores & wrinkles until covered as best as possible. Remember aged ladies, like me: nothing will make these imperfections disappear short of surgery; however you can cover them with my techniques above pretty darn well! Do not use a powder to set this foundation, because all powders will settle into the above mentioned imperfections &/or give your foundation the appearance of a caked texture.[You can however use a light dusting of a rice powder on any shiny areas only, if you\u2019d like]. Instead: wait for several minutes after applying foundation for it to dry as much as possible. Now, lightly spray all areas that you applied foundation to, (your face, neck & decollate), & hold your face in front of a fan for 10 seconds until all areas are dry. Repeat setting spray method once more. You\u2019re all set!! Your makeup will look flawless, it won\u2019t transfer, (unless you\u2019re being careless, & you know what I mean Girlfriends \ud83d\ude09), & it\u2019ll last for 8-12 hours, even if you go out & dance the tiles off the dance floor!! Yes, even as a Grandma of 7 I still do this myself occasionally! \ud83d\udc4d I\u2019ve been using this foundation with my techniques for 2 years now, after spending 100\u2019s of $\u2019s on less effective foundations for many decades. This is \u201cTHE FOUNDATION\u201d that all aged woman should use as the most effective, efficient, effortless foundation makeup ever\u203c\ufe0f. PS: I wasn\u2019t paid to write this review, I\u2019m not affiliated in any way with the foundation creator, nor with Amazon. But what I am is a woman who strongly believes in sharing my secrets with other women. I believe in uplifting all women I encounter; as \u201cwe\u2019ve come a long way baby\u201d, & we\u2019ll go so much farther in this life if we support one another along the way.",

What's even more surprising is that when I wear it, I get compliments on my skin. It goes on smoothly, and covers what you need covered. Stays on pretty much all day, and honestly, you WILL see a difference. I use Medium, and it does lighten my skin a little, but it still looks good. I think it's worth a try if you love makeup like I do.",

                "reviewText": "I have severe Rosacea on my checks, and finding foundation that covers it is a challenge. After reading the reviews for this particular foundation, I decided to give it a try. I am shocked at how well this works! It instantly covered my way too pink cheeks, I just can't believe it! Also, it goes on very smoothly, and it has made my skin feel so good. I am a month shy of 65 (gasp!), if that helps give you an idea of what might work for you. This foundation has my vote! Others have commented that the brush was poor quality, and it did lose a bristle when I used it, but I really like it. It's so soft, and has a nice wide surface so when you spray the makeup on it, it catches all of the spray. I haven't tried spraying the makeup directly on my face; I don't think that's such a good idea! Regardless, in my opinion, this is a wonderful foundation, and is justvery reasonably priced. It's definitely worth a try! I received some other foundation for Christmas from my daughter, and it is quite expensive. While it is nice, it didn't cover my Rosacea at all, not even when I used concealer first and then applied setting powder. The redness was still shining through. This makeup covered it with one application with no concealer or setting powder used! In my book that's a WIN!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019d read a review of this product on a news feed. I have been curious about air brushing makeup. I did not understand how it would work. The price was reasonable enough to make me want to try it. I am finding as I age- the tinted Bb cream I have been using is fine for the hot weather but does not work as well in the cold drier weather.I ordered the palest color as I am very fair skinned. There are 2 choices - the color desired and then a \u201cbright\u201d version. While I do not know the difference between the regular and bright- I chose the bright to give my 70 year old skin a bit of brightness if that\u2019s what it did.I have worn this everyday for a week. The makeup comes in a spray can and the product is sprayed on a lush- soft - thick brush. It goes on easily and actually quite nicely. It\u2019s not heavy like the powder in a compact. The coverage is surprisingly even and smooth. It doesn\u2019t crack or dry out during the days wear and so far has not required any touch up. I expected to need that. So it was a great surprise to not have to.I like the color- it does have a brightness to it but not glittery. It also has no particular odor - which is very nice. I am surprised at how nice and smooth my skin looks wearing it. It comes off easily at the end of the day with soap and water or make up remover cloth.I am delighted with the product- with the application method and the wonderful application brush. I love how it looks on me. No one is more surprised than me.I will buy this again",
