Over the years I've tried no less than 10 -- maybe even 20? -- types of bags, totes, storage bins, etc. in the search for something portable yet roomy enough to hold all of my products and still semi-decent-looking were I to leave it sitting on a shelf somewhere. These little puppies fit the bill, and even better, they hold a LOT. I have one for hair stuff that fits a flat iron, a mnii curling iron, and several full-size bottles of hair oils, etc., plus one for makeup, one for skincare, and another for brushes (yes, I store my brushes all flat and jumbled together, feel free to judge me). One of my favorite things about these is that the inside is slick and easy to wipe clean but doesn't have that cheap plastic-y feeling to it. Anyway, buy a bunch because once these catch on I'm sure they'll start cutting down on quality, as most companies sadly do.",

This can carry as little or as much as you want and the best part is how I can just open it and put it on the bathroom counter and everything is very easy to see/find. There are a couple of pockets that are really kind of worthless. They are too small to do any good. Other than that, it's a great option for travel.",

I love the way it opens up wide so you can see the contents. Some bags have too many compartments I find. This one fits a lot, but closes up in a second and can fit flat into a bag or suitcase. I have already purchased a second one of these to use for my 4 year old\u2019s asthma inhaler, toiletries, small toys, etc. for traveling or on a plane. The possibilities are endless!",
