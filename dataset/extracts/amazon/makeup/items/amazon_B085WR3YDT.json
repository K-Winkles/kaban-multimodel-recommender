                "reviewText": "I remember back in the early 90's going to Woolworths and there'd be these bins with cheap 99 cent makeup. Crazy colors like blue nail polish and black lipstick, colors that you didn't really see anywhere else back then, all piled up in these bins. They were all Wet N Wild, and I loved going through these bins and picking out a few items each time I visited. I always associated Wet N Wild with kitschy cheap makeup bins because of this, not that this was a bad thing. I also stopped seeing Wet N Wild after Woolworths went out of business and I always thought that was a shame, an end of an era. So imagine my surprise when I came across this!I've been on the hunt for the perfect shade of purple eyeshadow for years. Sephora had an eyeshadow pencil that had the perfect shade for me. The color was great, but the application was a bit on the chalky side. Still, it never failed to get compliments everytime I left the house with it on. Sadly, it was discontinued and I only bought one. So when that ran out, I tried in vain for years to find a suitable replacement. I started just buying any purple that remotely matched from any brand just to see if it'd work. I came across this and was surprised that 1., Wet N Wild was still a thing and 2., the color looked promising. Knowing my history with Wet N Wild and its bargain bin legacy, I didn't have high expectations on its quality. I bought this and another brand with a similar color that cost three times as much. I put this on my right eyelid and the expensive one on my left and whoa.... This pencil is AMAZING! The color glided on like silk. It wasn't chalky or hard or anything. It felt almost creamy. The pigmentation is rich, one pass and it was opaque and popping. I was able to glide over my eyelid a second coat and it went on so smoothly. No skin tugging, no pigment chunks falling off the pencil. Two coats and I couldn't stop staring at my eyes. The color is amazing. It was so much more vibrant than the more expensive brand. My only regret is not stocking up on more of these when they were in stock.Wet N Wild really threw me for a loop. I was expecting the bargain bin quality of my youth but this outperformed all my other color pencils. And this was by far the cheapest!! It's amazing that they kept the bin prices but seriously stepped up the quality! I'm definitely buying more and trying their other colors!",

Goes on smoothly without pressing on the lid or tugging on the skin (especially relevant to mature eyes with looser skin in the outer corners) and blends effortlessly with the finger. Bought it together with the Burning Bridges shade, which turned out to be a brighter red than Reddy Set Go's more maroon shade, even though the plastic casings are the opposite -- BB darker and RSG lighter.",

I was attracted by the bright blue color and the positive reviews on Amazon. I have to say that I am very impressed by this product and how well it performs.The Wet n Wild Color icon Multi Sticks are creamy and pigmented, and they glide on smoothly without tugging or pulling. They blend easily with a finger or a brush, and they have a subtle shimmer that adds some dimension to the face. The Blue Lah shade is a vibrant cobalt blue that can be used to create a bold and fun look, or a subtle and wearable one depending on how much you apply and blend. I like to use it as an eyeliner, a pop of color on the lids, or a sheer wash of color on the cheeks. It lasts for several hours without fading or creasing, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.The only downside of this product is that it is not very precise, so you have to be careful when applying it near the eyes or the lips. You may also need to sharpen it often to keep the tip sharp. However, these are minor issues that do not affect the overall quality and performance of the product.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to experiment with different colors and looks. The Wet n Wild Color icon Multi Sticks are affordable, versatile, and easy to use, and they come in a variety of shades to suit different skin tones and preferences. They are definitely worth trying if you are looking for a fun and convenient makeup product.",
