I love how pink quartz is a very subtle color with just a slight tint of pink. I didn't time how long but noticed it lasted for over an hour. It makes me lips all nice and shiny.

It makes your lips feel so soft! I\u2019ve never tried a lip oil before, but I\u2019m obsessed now. And it gives a pretty shiny color as well. Great buy for the price!",

Looks great over a little lip color/ liner. Frequent reapplication is necessary, but worth it. Treat yourself to every color, because at less than 10 bucks you can afford to.",
