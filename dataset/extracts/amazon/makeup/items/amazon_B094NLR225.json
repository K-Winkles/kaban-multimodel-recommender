And the little sponges are in a very pleasing pallet of pinks that simply makes my heart happy to look at!I haven\u2019t had them long enough to need to clean them (they were a gift at Christmas), but thus far I haven\u2019t noticed any bristle loss!

The pink set has pink bristles and pink handles almost a barbie pink. The purple set has softer almost baby pink handles and purple bristles. I am aware that colors of actual product often do not match the image used. What i ordered and what i wanted were purple bristles with purple handles. what i got was purple bristles with pink handles. yes i get that the color of the handles have no effect on the brushes and their intended use. the point of this review is i was expecting something in a specific color, what i got does not even come close to being in the same color family as purple.",
