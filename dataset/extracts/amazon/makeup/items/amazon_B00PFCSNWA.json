I also have a slight red tint to my face and this covers it completely. Highly recommend!By the way, for anyone else with oily skin, or any type skin really - If you find yourself wanting to reapply your powder later in the day, I recommend using a different sponge or something so you don't contaminate the one you normally use on your clean face. It will make your power and the applicator last a lot longer.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great powder for your purse - compact and light coverage for touch ups! It doesn\u2019t clog my pores and actually gives me a very polished matte finish. I keep this on me all the time and if the sponge applicator gets dirty, just use hot soap and water to clean / air dry. Love this brand!",
