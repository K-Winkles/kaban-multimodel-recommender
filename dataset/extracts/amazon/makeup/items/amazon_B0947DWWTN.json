It passed the trying it out on your hand test, but on the eye lids it's way too shear and pale, you can barely see it. I fixed mine by adding brown mica powder to make the color more dense,and it worked like a charm! So unless you want to dig yours out and mix it with cosmetic grade mica powder/ or an old broken up eye shadow, don't buy it.",
