                "reviewText": "I purchased this for two reasons1. To get brushes cleaner and dryer, faster.2. To save on brush cleaning product. (Some reviews complain that this didn't clean their non-water soluble make-up brushes when using water. Sigh. Of course not, if makeup was waterproof, it's not going to get clean using just water. The problem isn't the spinner, it's user error....When cleaning manually, my brushes soak up the cleaner (Garnier Micellar Water- (MW) pink top) and I wasted a lot, and got only moderately clean brushes, and they needed at least a day to dry. What I did today, using the same MW product, got 2 dozen brushes nearly new condition, very dry. I'll never be without this spinner. After putting the brush holder on a brush, pulling off, putting on again for step two, I set up an assembly line.1. Small bowl with Micellar water (MW)2. Brush Cleaning bowl3. MW in the bowl that comes with kit4. Wide mouth Mason jar with dawn and water5. Wide mouth Mason jar with regular waterAs the first bowl of MW got dirty, I'd use some of the MW from the spinning bowl to replace it, and topped of the spinning bowl with fresh MW. This saved product, and got max use out of the MW.You will also need AAA batteries, and probably gorilla glue or super glue, as in my experience a few brushes pulled off from the handles since they weren't glued well to start with. It has nothing to do with the spinner.By starting with MW, it really didn't matter if the makeup was water soluble or not. Everything came out clean. I cleaned my wedges with with the MC that was in the bowl when I was finished cleaning the brushes, then used the dawn and the regular water jars, so all my applicators are clean now! Absolutely nothing wasted. This spinner will pay for itself in two uses just from the savings on MW. If you use pricier brush cleaner, it will save you even more $$ faster.",

                "reviewText": "Ok soooo I'm not a big makeup person but I recently started wearing foundation because I realized that I\u2019m 31 years old and my skin tone is uneven. Since I\u2019ve started wearing makeup I have not cleaned my brushes as consistently as I should because my biggest annoyance was cleaning them and having them dry for a day or two depending on how thick the brush was.So when I was at the store and I saw a makeup cleaner like this one for 40$ I was tempted to buy it because of how easy it looked and it promised the brushes being instantly dry. But I didn\u2019t want to pay 40$\u2026 thankfully Amazon exists and I hopped on here and found almost the same exact one for waaaay cheaper. Half the cost.I used it just now for my foundation brushes that reaaaaallly needed it as you can tell from the pictures and omg\u2026. They are soo clean! I forgot that the tip of the brushes were actually silver like that. I had to go through two rounds though because my brushes be dirty. But the second bath cleaned them completely.AND the best part? I can use them right away if I needed too! They are completely dry and now my foundation goes on so much smoother :3 this is a must have for anyone who wears makeup. The process is so satisfying to watch as your brushes come out perfectly clean. after seeing what the bowl looked like after the cleaning it reminded me of how I take my coffee :P",

                "reviewText": "First off, I bought this product expecting it to be new, but it was clearly a returned item. It had a broken piece of eyeliner inside the box and smudgey eyeliner finger prints on the instruction manual. Everything else was still in plastic and clean, so I'm gonna let that slide. Just beware.I cleaned all of my makeup brushes, big, small, flat, round, angled, all the shapes!At first I followed the instructions exactly but the brushes barely got clean. It spins extremely slowly when even the tip of the brush touches the water. I ended up using a cleaning mat then just used this product to dry the brushes.For my bigger fluffy brushes, this was amazing for drying! Not 100% dry but a lot dryer than I could do with a towel without damaging anything.As the brushes got smaller, the device started wobbling more to the point where it wasn't really doing much in the way of drying anything.For flat brushes of all sizes, it didn't really do much either.I am not completely unhappy that I got this since it works well to dry my big brushes , which usually takes a day or two (compared to the small ones which dry quick anyway), but it just isn't as good as I wanted it to be. If the spinny device was a bit more powerful and sturdy, this product would be a hit.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I hardly ever leave reviews, but this product is worth it. My brushes have been neglected for awhile and are several years old, so I purchased this based on the reviews. Because my brushes were so gross, I sprayed each one with Dawn power wash and let it sit for a few seconds, then used Dawn liquid soap in the container before putting in medium temp water. Each brush has been restored. The entire process for 14 brushes took about 20 minutes, but I think if I do this regularly, it'd take about 15 seconds per brush. Super simple set up and I am happy with the results!",
