        "description": "The Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge flawlessly blends liquid and cream products with ease for a streak-free, luminous glow. Our #1 makeup blending sponge offers a natural, dewy finish, and its micro-fine pores help create a seamless base with light to medium coverage. Real Technique\u2019s MCS works best with liquid and cream makeup products such as foundation, skin tints, and illuminators. This makeup sponge has RT's unique 3-point application technique that makes blending products seamless. First use the flat edge of the MCS to pack on product, then the precision tip to conceal, and finally, blend it all out with the rounded side. Use it damp for extra dewiness and let that inner glow shine through. The Miracle Complexion Sponge is easy to clean using our Real Techniques Brush + Sponge Cleansing Gel. It\u2019s also 100% cruelty-free, vegan, and designed with revolutionary latex-free foam technology. We are Real Techniques, the brand of choice for all makeup users, no matter your level of expertise. Created in collaboration with leading makeup artists, we aspire to take the mystery out of choosing beauty tools so you can focus more time on putting your best face forward one blend at a time. From full makeup looks, to quick beauty hacks, RT brushes + sponges are exceptionally high quality for professional looking results every time. BUT\u2026 don\u2019t be fooled by our affordable prices, RT tools are award-winning + purposefully designed because that\u2019s what you deserve. Quality without compromise.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the real techniques miracle complexion sponges for years and so far they've been my favorite for applying liquid foundation. I get the sponge wet under running water and then squeeze out the excess water before using. This way the sponge doesn't absorb too much of my product and does well at applying and blending it on my face without much force or effort.Each sponge can last a while even with daily use if you take care of it and clean it. Allow it to dry between uses so as not to allow mold to grow.I've used sponges that feel more dense and harder to wash (including one of these once, so I'm not sure if it was just a random difference in manufacturing or somehow a different sponge), but usually these ones have a more airy feel to them and are easy to squeeze while washing.These sponges feel very gentle on the face, so much that even going back to a soft face brush feels more harsh than I'm used to. Another benefit of using these is that they don't leave any streaks that need further blending like brushes can and I feel are faster to dry.",

I use slightly damp and they\u2019re perfect! Foundation goes on so smooth and sleek! Price is great! You won\u2019t be disappointed!
