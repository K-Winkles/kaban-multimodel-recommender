                "reviewText": "I used this product for my makeup in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. It stayed on well, though I wish I'd had some cold cream to remove it. I used my fingers mostly to spread and apply, and used a bronzer brush instead of the puff pad to apply the setting powder. I like the look of it in the container - very nice and easy to use. Looks really nice and professional and re-packs into the box really easily.Warning - (this is not the products fault, it happens with all stage makeup, but) This Will Make You Break Out. Wash your face really well before and after using! But pimples are unavoidable!I liked the variety of foundation shades, and found that all four of them would work in a pinch. And the two pink options were nice, I didn't use the darker one since my character needed to be boyish, but will be a perfect lip color ofr a more feminine character. (The pink drops on my cheeks are paint, not from the kit - same goes for the green eyebrows) You have to be careful with the white not to smudge a bunch of other colors into it. I haven't tried the stipple sponge, but the brush and eyebrow pencil both work well. If I had a complaint it would be that after a while the pink I put on my eyelids got smudged and wrinkled. But overall this kit worked really well and I will still have enough for another production next season! (after three dress rehearsals and two performances)",

There are enough different shades of base to work for any fair skinned person, and the two shades of red/pink work perfectly for lips and cheeks. The makeup held well and required only minimal touch up at intermission (mostly on the lips because my character had several kissing scenes). After using it on my son and me for two dress rehearsals and two shows, there's even plenty left for my daughter to use next week in her own show. I'd definitely buy this again.",
