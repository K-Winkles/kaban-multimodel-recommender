It makes it easy to identify whats in each drawer.The construction makes this very sturdy storage, storage for just about anything (size willing, obviously). If in doubt, grab a tape measure!Each section can be stacked (as seen in the main photo) or used alone. Once stacked, sections do not move or slide around.Each drawer section has it's own liner. The liners are felt on one side & rubber on the other, which keeps the liner from moving when using the drawers. It helps accent what's in each drawer & the light bounces off making a sharp contrast, it literally shines!The drawers slide in & out with ease. Multiple size drawers accommodate just about everything, from lg shadow palettes to lipsticks!Its size is compact enough for most any bathroom counter. And it wipes down with a soft cloth to easily remove dust, fingerprints, etc w/ease!I purchased mine for my most frequently used cosmetics. I plan on buying another for symmetry on our bathroom counters & for my husbands personal products.And another for my office to organize all my \"little\" office items like pens, thumb tacks, magnets, paperclips, rubberbands, etc. It will fit easily on my office bookshelf.It comes securely packed. It has styrofoam top & bottom to keep it from shifting. Its double boxed to protect it from damage. It arrived in pristine condition!One of the best purchases this year! These make excellent gifts too. I'm definitely sold & will return to purchase more!",
