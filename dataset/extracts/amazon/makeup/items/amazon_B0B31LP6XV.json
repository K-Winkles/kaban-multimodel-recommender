                "reviewText": "I bought this set in lieu of a very expensive and hyped brand name product because I wanted to see how the technique looks on my face. The packaging was ok, they are a bit smaller than they appear in the pictures. One of the tubes was broken in a way that I have to push the product down while twisting to get it to spin up.The colors are nice for my skin tone, but they do not last. The formula does not have enough moisture and when you use a blending brush, the product just sticks to the brush and not your face... essentially wiping it off. Only the glitter of the frosty highlight remained and even then, it just looked like glitter spread over my face, it did not make a highlighting effect.",

You will regret it.Product is small,,, as in very short and tiny in size. The tube is about 2inches tall. The head of the makeup is 1/2 inch in circumfrance. If you are good with that---great.The3 sticks are too little to feel like you have a normal hold to apply properly. I have danty, slender hands too. Maybe it is because they are so short? Who knows.. They may be great size for kids to play with...but adults, they are awkward to hold and apply. It's weird.The highlight color is fine, other than that--this is not for me.Sorry but I can not recommend this product based on my own experience.Upside is, cost was under 20 bucks. IF it was more than that I would be returning it. I will keep for the highlight little stick.",
