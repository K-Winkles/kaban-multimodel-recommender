                "reviewText": "I've always used white eyeliner on my lower lash line - I started doing that way back when white eyeliner was the thing. (Ok, yes - I've been wearing makeup since the late '80s. Well that was an instant downer! lol) I can't wear mascara on my lower lashes because it slides right off and onto the delicate skin under my eyes...and usually won't budge after that, making my eyes look heavy and dark for the rest of the day. Using a light application of white eyeliner RightUpUnder my lower lashes makes my eyes look wider and brighter. (I still don't wear mascara on my lower lashes.) I had a hard time finding it after the popularity of white makeup waned in the early '90s, so I resigned myself to carefully using a small amount of white eye shadow under there for the longest time. I was never very happy with those results - it was rough getting the shadow under the lashes without winding up with spatters of it under my eyes, creating shiny patches where I put concealer - something you don't want. It was difficult finding the right white shadow - any sort of sparkle or frost looked...goofy. So when I saw this NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner in Milk, I almost had a coronary.This is AWESOME! It goes on smooth and doesn't tug or skip. It is very easy to blend with a cotton bud and it's just the right shade of white. It lasts all day with one application, making touch-ups a thing of the past. It's nice and thick, which means this will last forever. I also usually wear a small dab of white shadow in the inner corners of my eyes - that trick also helps make the eyes look wide, bright, and alert. This doubles for that purpose, cutting down on the amount of junk I have to buy and carry. I also don't have to worry about this falling apart in my makeup bag, like eye shadows can when you travel or aren't real gentle with your purse. I've been using this for about a month and I haven't even had to sharpen it to expose more creamy liner yet - a nod to how well the color lays down. I have some eyeliners that I have to sharpen almost daily, since it seems to take a ton to make any color show up. That isn't the case with this!This is listed as an \"Eye Pencil\" - and it is a pencil shape. However, when I think of a pencil eyeliner, I think of a Kohl pencil - they are usually soft, easily smeared, and seem to break a lot. This eyeliner is not like that at all! It is a rich, creamy formula - totally different than what I've experienced with other \"Eye Pencils\". I just wanted to throw that out there in case you are hesitating to purchase this because of the issues you've had with \"Eye Pencils\" in the past. This is so easy to draw on right from the pencil - draw the line, smudge with a cotton bud, look gorgeous. Simple! Other than using this pencil in the inner corners of my eyes, I haven't really tried it as a shadow - so I can't speak to how well they work/don't work in that capacity. I know it lasts all day in my eye corners - and I have to say that if I don't quickly blend it after a quick swipe by my nose, I can't move this eyeliner...AT ALL. (I'm finding that to be the case with all the new \"gel\" eyeliners - which isn't a complaint, just an observation.) I can say that it absolutely rocks as a sweat-proof, rub-proof, blink-proof, run-into-an-ex-boyfriend-proof, long-day-proof eyeliner. I LOVE IT!",

I would recommend if you need a white liner.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for \"Cottage Cheese\", which is a shimmery white.About me: 40 something, barely emerging fine lines (so far so good!), dry, rosacea prone skin. Sensitive eyes. Dark hair, dark eyes, fair skin (alabaster).I love jumbo eye pencils. I think they are great way to add some color- whether all over lid, or as an eye liner. Creamy eye pencils just make it easy to quickly apply some color without spending much time doing so. I love the creamy aspect to jumbo eye pencils, and I find that they rarely irritate my sensitive eyes. I usually use 100% Pure brand for creamy eye pencils, but they have done away with them. So I have been trying out different brands as I find them. I bought a few colors from this collection, as the add on price made it easy and budget friendly to do so.I love white or super light eye color. My skin is fair, cool, and slightly pink. This is a great color if you like a very soft, shimmery white. It adds just a little shimmer with a hint of white. I thought it was going to be my go-to cream pencil as I really like to just take a quick swipe of white to my lids to perk them up before heading out the door. The color is nice, but it doesn't quite stand out, like it is almost similar to my skin tone. I have applied it directly to my skin, and I have used it with a primer and powder. I'd say it definitely needs the latter for staying power.Sadly, the product makes my eyes feel weird after a short period of time. Kinda tired feeling, kinda itchy.. meh.While application is creamy, it does tug a little on the skin. I find myself applying it then smoothing it out with my finger as gently as possible. It doesn't apply strong enough to create a visible line. So if you wanted to use it as a defined eye liner, you may not be successful in doing so. I also have a darker color which I use this for, and it really just applies a soft sweep of color rather than a line. I think these are best as an eyes shadow, or as a highlighter.As for container.. so once you get through the exposed product, you can only reach more of it by sharpening it. It really could have a turn base to move product up rather than people having to use a large sharpener to cut away at the hard casing. Sharpening is fine if the material around the product is conducive to easy sharpening without losing integrity of product or patience of user. This material is not a great choice for that.",
