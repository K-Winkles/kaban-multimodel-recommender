The book shares her product recommendations (many from her kit so we know they are great choices, although each face is of course individual) as well as tips for dealing with challenges eg oily vs dry skin - serums, moisturizer, or eye liner application tips for hooded eyes. The book really complements Hannah\u2019s excellent Instagram content, answering many questions that other books don\u2019t touch on. What makes this such a special book is Hannah\u2019s talent and ability to communicate with both the everyday makeup user and fellow makeup artists, which comes through beautifully. All pictures (photos and diagrams) are stunning and so helpful. A truly wonderful guide to Makeup (including skincare, tools etc) as well as a great intro about Hannah herself, her passion for makeup and her work. I\u2019ve given these out as gifts - INSPIRING and reflective of Hannah\u2019s JOY OF MAKEUP. 10/10",
