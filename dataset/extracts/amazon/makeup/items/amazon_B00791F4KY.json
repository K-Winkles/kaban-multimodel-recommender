The bronzer is good as a contour and the highlighter has a light champagne color. It looks so natural on my skin without looking muddy/too much. The only downside is the highlighter is delicate and came broke but I could still use it. Too lazy to return and get another one. I wanted to use it right away.",

This \"stick\" just swipes on - easy to apply & see exactly where you're putting color. It builds so easily, a little practice makes it easy to feel how firmly to press & where to draw the contour.My only problem is that I am VERY pale, so highlighter colors are almost always darker than or too similar to my skin tone. The shimmer here helps, but I generally only use the contour and not the highlighter.",
