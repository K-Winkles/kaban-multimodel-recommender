I have thin eyebrows, but this product makes my eyebrows look so much better and more defined. It takes very little of the product to do the job, therefore it isn't necessary to keep applying more. I used it very sparingly and it kept my eyebrows looking neat and defined all day through evening without any touch ups. I must admit I used to put hairspray on an old mascara brush and use that on my eyebrows, but that didn't work unless I kept applying more. What a wonderful product at a very reasonable price!",

Holds brows all day and looks amazing. I do not use any make-up on my brows and find not only does it sculpt them but also makes shape fuller and color richer. It\u2019s a fairly thick product but doesn\u2019t flake throughout day. A very small container (wish larger), I\u2019ll see how long it lasts, but a little goes a long way. Easy to use application brush. Also, did not make me breakout which sometimes happens with brow products.",

                "reviewText": "I have invisible brows and am always looking for grow products. This was not expensive and the described color sounded like it might work. When it arrived, it's a tiny tube with a small spoolie brush. Ok for the price. Product is thick and kind of sticky. It takes a bit of experimenting to get it applied in a way that works. The color is taupe, but it is actually more of a transparent tint than an opaque color. I was a bit disappointed until I started using this OVER other brow color products! The glue aspect works great! It smoothes wild hairs and after it sets I can add light touches of other product to get the look I want. In this instance the transparent tint aspect of the product makes it work well for me! I will be purchasing it again.",
