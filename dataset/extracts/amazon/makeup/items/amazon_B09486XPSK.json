                "reviewText": "Pros: it's moisturizing, luxurious-feeling, vegan, and highly affordable.Cons: The main reason why I was interested in this product is that I'd heard that this shade was a dupe for Clinique's Black Honey. I agree it's a very similar product. However, I was mildly disappointed to find that this shade of lip color suits me no better than Black Honey, which I tried over twenty years ago.While Black Honey and its dupes are touted as a shade that is universally flattering, that's really an exaggeration. It's not so much that \"this shade looks terrific on everybody,\" it's more like \"this shade doesn't look terrible on anyone.\"On me, it's a purplish berry color that doesn't exactly clash with my skin tone, but it doesn't exactly complement it either. It just looks... okay. Nobody ever compliments me on this lip color when I wear it, unlike this other lipstick that I have, which gets me compliments from complete strangers at the supermarket every time I wear it. I think the issue is that Black Honey and all of its dupes are a little too cool, and my skin requires a slightly warmer lip color in order to look good.Having said that, I intend to keep wearing this because of its excellent moisturizing properties. Next time, I'll try the same Elf product but in one of the warmer shades, which I bet will look great on me. I think Giddy is the one that will work best on me, and if that one turns out to be too warm or too bright and saturated, Cheery will be my next pick. Giddy and Cheery appear to be very similar shades, except that Cheery seems to be more sheer and less saturated.",

Very hydrating if you have dry lips but want a bit of color and shine that will stay put but not feel too heavy. Color coverage is full like a lipstick, not a sheer tint. Has shine but not overly glossy. Probably the best lip color and moisturizer combo I've ever tried and the price point is great for what it is. Will get more in a couple more colors.",

I have to overlap it with some gloss just for it to be nice. It smells really good almost like a candy but I wish it was more glossy. The color will look different for everyone based on there skin tone and I like how it looks on mine. Then again I wish it was more glossy like they advertised it as. It\u2019s easy to apply and really smooth on my lips.",
