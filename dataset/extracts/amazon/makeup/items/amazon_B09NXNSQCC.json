Also, due to unfortunate genetics, I happen to have pretty big pores in my T-zone, but when I dust this stuff on over my moisturizer, it disguises them enough that I don't need to put on a bunch of make-up to feel comfortable leaving the house to run errands, etc.I have pink undertones in my face, so the light/medium shade isn't ideal for me doing full make-up because it's a bit too yellow. But, for a quick dusting over moisturizer, it's a good no-fuss option for days when I don't want to wear full make-up.",

Although there is an initial cast of white on the face, it absorbs in quickly for me and lasts a few hours. Great for the price and I am very happy with it. It is pretty powdery on the compact when applied with a brush so I would use a sponge or a powder puff :)",

                "reviewText": "Much smaller than I expected. The item weight says 1.27 ounces, which I thought would be bigger than my other pressed powder foundation, but I found out that this is the whole item size including the plastic case, not the actual makeup product size! It's significantly smaller that what I normally get for the same price. I initially got this because the color was slightly lighter than the one I'm using (bc I'm very fair skinned), most makeup products never match my skin tone. \ud83d\ude12 I still haven't found one that actually matches my skin tone. But anyway, as you can see the makeup product itself weight is much smaller than I'm currently getting for the same price. The other reason I wanted to get this was bc the lid snap close feature, it would be easier to take in my purse without the lid coming off or cracking like my other pressed powder makeup. But the depth of the makeup is significantly smaller & the dimension size is also smaller. The makeup is slightly lighter, but not too much of a difference. Look at the pics to compare. The actual makeup size for this Wet n Wild is 0.27 oz. My other makeup is 0.49 oz.",
