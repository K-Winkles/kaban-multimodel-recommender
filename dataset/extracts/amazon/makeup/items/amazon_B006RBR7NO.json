It removes eye makeup and sunscreen, dirt, oil, etc. without irritation, stripping, oiliness...just leaves behind clean, \"normal\" feeling skin! Sometimes i still use a cleansing oil or gentle bar cleanser, but i have been using this alone 75% of the time and my skin looks and feels great! I can tell it will last a while, after using this about 2x daily for a few weeks you can barely see the volume going down. I have switched all my products to French drugstore brands, and the difference in my skin is noticeable!",

                "reviewText": "I have rosacea and dry, very reactive/sensitive skin. I used micellar water a long time ago and the issue I had with it was that it over cleansed my skin to the point of showing pits in my pores, it was nasty. I refused to use a micellar water after that. I bought this on special to see if it would have the same effect or not, hoping I could incorporate it into my double cleanse. It does not take eye make up off very well BUT it does take off foundation pretty effectively. I use the Loreal makeup remover for my eyes, followed by wiping this on the rest of my face, then my cleanser. This has the added benefit of leaving my skin very soft, I was not expecting that! Highly recommend this if you have very reactive/allergic skin and want to give micellar water a go.Some ladies like to use this as a single step with no wash off. Based on what I've seen on youtube, micellar water does have mild surfactants that over time of laying on your skin, can possibly give you issues. So that's my precaution to you. I would wash this off afterwards.",
