I have looked high and low for a brush that would not suck up my foundation into its bristles and would be soft enough for my face and here it is, this foundation brush is amazing. Thick enough to hold your liquid foundation in place and soft enough to not scratch your face. This brush also applies your foundation evenly with such ease. I am 60 yrs old and have used many different foundation brushes and this is the first one I just simple love. I would recommend this brush all the ladies in my family.",

                "reviewText": "CONS (if you want to call it that) - this isn't necessarily a complaint, because I love this brush, but because the bristles are so dense, cleaning it thoroughly is a bit time consuming, especially if you're a liquid foundation user like I am. I'm a Clinique/Urban Decay full coverage foundation user, daily, and I try to clean my brush once/twice each week (yes, should be more, but... life). I use a good liquid makeup brush cleaner solution and warm water. Again, tough to complain, because the alternative is that it would be less dense and not as quality... I'll take the extended clean time!PROS -1. Great coverage - the brush is incredibly soft, but the density and mid-length of the bristles create a perfect firmness to push liquid makeup around beautifully. Totally even coverage, no brush strokes or uneven areas.2. Ergonomically awesome - the handle is thick and just long enough to let you get a firm hold and maneuver it where and how you need it without needing to readjust.3. Quality - 10/10 - The handle is great quality - I've had many brushes that start to come apart at the metal collar (the ring between the handle and brush), like the glue loses it's stick or something. I've had this brush for months now, with daily use, and there's no sign of weakness. The BRUSH is phenomenal, as I mentioned above, with the absolute best part being that it DOES NOT SHED. Again, daily use for MONTHS, and not a single hair has come out of this brush. That is the big selling point for me!",
