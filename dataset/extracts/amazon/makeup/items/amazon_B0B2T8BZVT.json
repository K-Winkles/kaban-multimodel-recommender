                "reviewText": "I actually love these! I didn't have any problems with build up however I did use the smudger to thin my makeup out. I didn't need a primer or a brush. The sponge tip works fantastically. I looked closer at her makeup and it appears that she has at least 4 different eyeshadow colors on. I do love that deep blue color. I purchased the pearl 1 and 10 to achieve this look with blue eyeshadow I already had and tonight I'm buying the black and the medium colored blue. I believe she used 4 different eyeshadow colors to create the effect on her eye. She has a neutral middle blue, the blue you will receive that they display is much darker than you think. It's more of a navy blue. I purchased the pearl white as well to accent the inside corners of the eye, and then I used liquid black as an eyeliner directly on the top for the cat eye effect and along the bottom water line and mid bottom eyelid, then I used the pearl white on the very outside of my lower eye. These are so easy to use. I really love and appreciate them. They are waterproof and my lids are not creasing however, I blended incredibly well. These are so perfect for a quick run to the grocery store or get fancy and blend several colors for more profound effects. These are super cool! Give one a try! I would like to say they are not true to the color. I'll try to load pictures when I can.If you want the same effect purchase the black, The Medium Blue, Pearl White, and the dark blue that I received is much darker than anticipated but I still love it. Make sure you have liquid black eyeliner, and false lashes. Voala you have the same look!I'll try to update my pictures.
