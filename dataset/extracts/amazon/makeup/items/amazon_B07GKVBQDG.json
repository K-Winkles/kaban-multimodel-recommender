                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, and I must say they have become a staple in my daily skincare routine. As someone with sensitive skin, finding a makeup remover that is both gentle and effective has always been a challenge. Neutrogena's offering, however, pleasantly surprised me.The first thing that stood out to me was the convenience of the packaging. The resealable closure ensures that the wipes stay moist and ready to use, making them perfect for on-the-go makeup removal or late-night skincare routines when you just want something quick and efficient.These wipes boast an impressive ability to remove makeup, even stubborn waterproof mascara and long-lasting lipsticks. With just one wipe, I found myself able to completely cleanse my face of makeup without excessive rubbing or irritation. The formula is gentle on the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and not overly dry or greasy.One of the key features I appreciate about these wipes is their non-comedogenic nature. As someone prone to occasional breakouts, it's reassuring to know that the product won't clog pores or contribute to skin issues. The absence of any heavy fragrance is also a plus for those with sensitivities to scented products.What makes these wipes stand out is the addition of the patented Neutrogena cleansing technology. It not only removes makeup but also effectively cleanses the skin, leaving it feeling soft and nourished. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin after regular use \u2013 it felt smoother and looked healthier.While the wipes are excellent for everyday use, they are particularly handy during travel. The compact packaging takes up minimal space in my toiletry bag, and I can trust that I have a reliable makeup remover with me wherever I go.In summary, Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes have earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine. They deliver on their promise of effective makeup removal without compromising on skin health. If you're in search of a reliable, gentle, and convenient makeup remover, these wipes are definitely worth trying.",

The napkin cloth is well saturated and removes makeup, but didn\u2019t quite get all the mascara (perhaps user error?), so I used my travel sized makeup eraser cloth and this napkin cloth and I was able to remove all the mascara. The napkin feels nice and soft on the skin. It left what felt like a moisturizing film on my skin which (which I didn\u2019t like), but after washing my face with my usual cleanser (Cetaphil), my skin felt wonderful! Had it removed all mascara I would give it 5 stars.",
