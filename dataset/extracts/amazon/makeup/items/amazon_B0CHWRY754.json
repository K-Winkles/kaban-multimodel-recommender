                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this mascara. My current favorite is another L\u2019Or\u00e9al mascara. This doesn\u2019t volumize my lashes at all. They get longer but no volume. Additionally this smudges horrendously. If you have even the tiniest bit of wateriness in your eyes, this mascara will end up everywhere. It smudged even when my eyes weren\u2019t watery. The formula is very wet even after two weeks of owning this. The best thing about this mascara is that the wand is a good size for smaller eyes. I did like the length, but the smudging was a deal breaker for me.Update: I was determined to make this mascara work because I paid good money for it, and I don't like to waste things. So, I've been using it at a layering mascara, and I have had zero issues with smudging as long as I put another mascara over it. This mascara gives me super long lashes, so I put this one on for length, and then I layer Lash Paradise over it. Works like a charm! I don't know if I'll repurchase though, but I'm making it work for now.",

                "reviewText": "I've been searching for a replacement mascara for a couple of years since the one I loved was discontinued. I was very eager to try this L\u2019Or\u00e9al Panorama product.Overall, I liked (but didn't \"love\") this mascara, and I will definitely continue to use it until I run out. It is a very deep black, and I like how bold the colour is on my lashes. It does a good job of lengthening, which is what I'm after--the brush seems to be a firm silicone, and not curved, and I found it very easy to work with for both upper and lower lashes.It goes on quite wet, and that gives me a little time to comb and separate lashes before it dries. I don't find it too clumpy, but I do find I like a little more separation than the brush offers.Once dry, I like that this mascara does not smudge. It also washes off fairly easily.The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that it starts to flake off my lashes fairly soon after drying. This is a problem I have with a LOT of mascaras (even though I am very careful to dry my lashes thoroughly before applying mascara). I know it's possible to find mascaras that don't flake off my lashes, but this is not one of them. I will give this Panorama mascara kudos for minimal flaking (it's not huge chunks, and not as much as I've experienced with other products), but I will keep looking for a product that doesn't have this effect on my lashes.Overall, this is a good mascara, it looks good, doesn't smudge and gives me nice length.",
