It comes with two sizes, so it's like the Swiss Army knife for all my lip, eye, and brow pencils. Sharpens them up without any break-up drama, even the softer ones. Plus, it's pint-sized, making it the perfect travel buddy. And, oh, it's got a secret compartment for pencil scraps\u2014no messy cleanups after every use.Negatives:Just a heads-up, don't go wild on the sharpening. The cap holding the pencil bits isn't the most reliable. Overstuff it, and it might just decide to fling pencil confetti all over your makeup bag.Overall:This sharpener is like a low-key hero in my makeup stash. Does the job, no fuss, and still kicking after 3 years.",

That original one is still working but I thought I should get a new one after 10 years. Sharpens eyeliner pencils smoothly and evenly. That is all I ask of it and it delivers every time!",

This Revlon sharpener is the only one that manages to sharpen my Covergirl Kohl gel pencil eyeliner without tearing it up! And at this price point, I was not expecting such high precision. I will change my rating if it breaks or gets jammed with gunk or stops working, but for now I can confidently say it\u2019s a great sharpener.",
