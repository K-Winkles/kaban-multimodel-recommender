This mascara is buildable and when I reallt build, I can feel it against my glasses when I blink. Thia stuff works... AND if it tints my white lashes? Ita magic sent from the gods.",

I will say there\u2019s definitely a difference between the regular and waterproof, I couldn\u2019t get even close to the same result with the waterproof, it must be whatever ingredient makes it waterproof, but I just tossed that one and got a regular one and we\u2019re back in business!",

The color is perfect and the brush is very easy to use.",
