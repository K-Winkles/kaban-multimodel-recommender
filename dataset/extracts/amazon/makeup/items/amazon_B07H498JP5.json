It\u2019s a gel so it\u2019s cooling and moisturizing and doesn\u2019t feel heavy to apply. It does contain sparkles (which I love), but straight men will CONSTANTLY point out that you have sparkles on your face and boomer men will always giggle and say \u201chey you have something on your face\u201d so take with that what you will. If you can stomach men speaking to you, then I recommend this highlighter! The blue and the pink are both great but I really do swear by the pink. It really helps to make your cheekbones pop!",

                "reviewText": "I'm pale as a ghost and have a hard time finding various makeup products that don't come across as too garish. A lot of highlighters I've tried seem to be either way to glittery (like Twilight vampire glittery) or made me look like I was headed to a 70s disco party. This gel (jelly?) from Almay hits a sweet spot. It provides a very controllable amount of shimmer that is easy to apply, buildable, and isn't super shiny. I wasn't sure that the gold coloring would on my skin, but it provided a nice hint of warm glow that didn't scream fake. All that is needed is a little dab on each cheek. blend well, and you are left with a glow that looks natural rather than being blue or green or purple-hued. After some wandering on the interwebs, I saw where others had mixed in a little bit of this highlighter with their body lotion. This is a great way to impart the same warm glow to the rest of your skin without dropping more money on a teeny bottle of product. I liked that once the highlighter/lotion mixture dried on my skin, there was hardly any noticeable transfer on my clothes. The color did wear off a bit as the day went on. If you don't wash this off before going to bed, though, you will definitely have some sparkly bed sheets. I like the gentle glow and versatility of this highlighter, and prefer this medium compared to powder highlighters.",
