                "reviewText": "i was super excited to try out this blush ! i am a sucker for cream/liquid blush so i was hoping this would be worth it. and it definitely was !! the formula is actually really really blendable and it\u2019s pretty pigmented and you\u2019re able to build it up as much as you desire. i bought the shade \u201cDolce Vita\u201d and it\u2019s perfect for my skin tone and i feel like would be able to use on deeper complexions. I am a makeup artist so this has been a staple for brides in my kit and it has worked beautifully on every single person i\u2019ve used it on. The applicator looks like a nail polish brush which is different but nothing too crazy that one can\u2019t figure out. it helps with getting the product right where you want it so it works just fine ! I\u2019ve used it on days where i\u2019m full glam and on days where i am not wearing foundation and it works just the same on either makeup look. it doesn\u2019t cling on to foundation , which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to cream blushes at times, and it blends smoothly when i apply powder blush on top \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc If you\u2019re contemplating getting this blush just do it i promise you won\u2019t regret it ! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a nice easy liquid blush to try. I have never tried liquid blush before and to say this is so good! It is. Every blush or eyeshadow I tried using would always be a little patchy and I would have to use so much product! This blush (I have the 01 Pink in Love) is so good! It matches great and I can tell it would match just about every other skin tone. It\u2019s super easy to apply, (try a little at a time) one little touch is enough for a side of your face. Not a glob or a brush, just a tiny speck. It is so pigmented and it stays on so well. I LOVE this blush and will order this from now on. I used a sponge, my finger, and a blush brush and all worked so much for application. Thank you Kimuse!Side comment: Don\u2019t mind the sparkles on my face as it\u2019s not normal. I tried out a liquid bronzer and as you can tell. It was just glittery vs bronzer.",

At eight o'clock at night, I STILL had color on my lips, not a lot but I did not feel like I needed to apply lipstick! My new go-to long lipstick. You may feel a dryness, but it did not chap.
