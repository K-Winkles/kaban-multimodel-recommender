                "reviewText": "This makeup set was smaller than it looked in the pictures, but it makes this palette easier to travel with. One of the blushes came cracked due to poor packaging. There is a piece of plastic over the eye shadows, to keep the rest of the palette neat, but I wish that there was plastic over the other side as well. The box that the makeup comes in lacks some information: There is a list of items that the set includes, and everything is listed except for the concealer. Also, they do not list the ingredients for the concealer, when all of the other product ingredients are included. The whole kit has a baby powder smell, which is noticeable when the set is open, but not when you are wearing the makeup (except for the lip gloss). The eye shadows are very pigmented, and very easy to apply. There is a brush/sponge tip applicator; the brush side is way too small to use for blush, so I would recommend using it for the eye shadow. The applicator is a better quality than I had thought, which was great! The lip glosses are not as bright as they look; they are quite transparent. The two blushes are very pigmented, so when applying them, I would suggest using a light hand. The concealer is definitely not the best; it sets much more transparent than it looks and much better ones exist, but it is still handy to have. The powder is good for setting the concealer, so I am glad that Evctop included it in the palette. Even with the messed up blush, I am happy to have this Evctop Professional Makeup Kit. I hope to use it when I travel, or to put in my purse.",
