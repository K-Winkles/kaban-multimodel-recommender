                "reviewText": "I truly didn't know what to expect of this. But I always want to try new products, and this sounded pretty intriguing. I didn't really know what it was going to be like, or how I was going to use it. Upon receiving it, I was even more unsure, but the first time I tried it, I loved it and all confusion was cleared up!You really could used this product in several different ways, which is the beauty of it. It can be applied as sheerly as you like, but it also can produce pretty nice coverage. This will not be a full coverage foundation. Of course, it is marketed as a serum, so you wouldn't expect to. But I do use it as a foundation. I have pretty good skin and not a lot to cover. You could use this sheerly, as a skin care/primer layer under your normal foundation. You can wear it on its own, layering it as you wish for your desired level of light to medium coverage. I put on a layer of it (always using my fingers, I tried other methods, but since this is a serum meant for skin, care that didn't make much sense to me, and I really found fingers worked best anyhow), then put a bit more on my nose and chin, where I need more coverage. Then I put some concealer/corrector under my eyes. I could leave it at that if I wished. You might want to, depending on the finish you want and whether or not you are someone who needs to use powder. The finish on its own is beautiful. Natural, a tiny bit dewy but not greasy at all. But I just can't stand not using powder, so I powder. Doing that, my face looks great all day. I don't have that made-up look that foundation can sometimes give you. This is lighter, more natural looking.I bought the lightest color. The color foundation I buy varies on the brand. Some brands I need the lightest, but most often it is the second or third lightest. I would say I am fair to light, and this lightest shade works perfectly. I think this product will fit a bit of range of tones and shades, thus the limited product range. You don't need an exact match. I suggest you go to the L'Oreal site to help you pick which to order if you are questioning it, you might get a better idea there.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to see what the hype was all about with this foundation and I'm officially on the bandwagon! This foundation is amazing for my skin. I do see why a lot of reviews mention it has a yellow tint. I have pretty fair skin with a yellow undertone and this is just on the edge of where it could go overboard, but for me it gives my skin some color so it's perfect.It doesn't look great when I first apply it so the first time I was very underwhelmed by the look until I saw myself in the mirror a little later and was stunned by how good the foundation looks. So I learned that it takes a little while to set - maybe 10 minutes or so - and then my skin looks flawless! It also lasts the whole day for me so my face doesn't look a mess later, and as long as I put setting spray on there are no weird creases and my makeup doesn't look like it's melting off in my t-zone. This kind of gives my face a soft angelic glow like a cherub lol. It takes years off my face and I can definitely see why everyone raves about it.I do also wish, as everyone has here, that there was a pump instead of a dropper. The dropper is messy and I'm always worried I'm going to drop or spill the contents of the bottle during application. If it had a pump dispenser, it would be absolutely perfect. But this is a minor issue for me, so it still gets 5 stars. This rivals my favorite Tom Ford foundation, which is saying a lot, and at this price point I'm going to give this one the edge. Foundation is tricky because everyone's skin is different, but this 1,000% works for me and I hope it never gets discontinued!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a product that was dewy and had a shear coverage (enough to even out my skin tone but able to let my imperfections show through) and that\u2019s when I found this product.It definitely is light weight, it can be shear and provides the dew but the great thing is you can build it up and it can definitely provide me with a good medium to full coverage. I\u2019m normally the type that has to ALWAYS set under the eye because of the way that my eyes are, they have lines under there and they crease within seconds but somehow when I use the remaining product on my brush (that I used for my face) on my under eyes to slightly cover the dark circles, it doesn\u2019t crease! So it\u2019s perfect for me for someone who\u2019s looking for a no makeup makeup look for my skin",

                "reviewText": "I'm in my mid fifties with very fair, dry skin, and very few lines or wrinkles (thanks to genetics mostly). I initially picked this up in the shade 2-3 at my local Walgreens, but it was too dark for me (although it would probably be fine during summer when I'm a little tanned). So I came here and bought 0.5-2, which is a nearly perfect match for me right now (plus it was less expensive here).I don't care for an overly \"made up\" look like many of the younger kids seem to enjoy these days - not for myself anyway because it feels too heavy on my skin making me constantly aware of it. Also, I'm nearly always in a hurry, so my application method is: 2 pumps of a gel moisturizer, 1 drop of tea tree oil, 1 drop of almond oil, and 1 pump of this foundation (yes, I bought a pump for this bottle because I hated the mess of the dropper), rub together in my hands then apply to my face like a tinted moisturizer. Apply a setting spray, add a tinted brow gel, lip balm, eyeshadow & waterproof mascara, re-spray and I'm done in 5 minutes tops. Applied this way, it looks natural...but better. It's sheer enough to let my naturally rosy cheeks show through (no need for blush!) but evens out the tone of my skin a bit. My face feels moisturized and non-irritated, and my makeup stays put all day. It works for me!",

This has a very high probability of becoming a holy grail product for me.I'm very fair neutral and the Very Light shade is perfect for me.The only con to the product is the packaging, the pipette is annoying and gets messy so I bought a screw on pump dispenser to replace the pipette. I do really like the glass component.",
