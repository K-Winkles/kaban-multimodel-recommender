                "reviewText": "So- this lip liner is the matte dryer waxy kind (not the type that glides and feels moisturizing). However, I personally prefer this type as I find they last longer and look the most realistic if you like to subtly overline. The shade peekaboo neutral is for you if you have naturally light/medium true pink lips (or want it to match a lipstick in that range)- it will be the PERFECT slight overline shade. Does not have a cool/grey undertone. If you prefer that try the shade natural. It's a bit deeper and slightly more neutral rather than pink. Nude pink is significantly lighter/brighter pink than both peekaboo and natural. It would be best for lips that are naturally quite a light/brighter pink. I adore this lip liner for the price especially.",

There's nothing I hate more than a liner that breaks every time you use it. The fact that it's sharpenable as opposed to a twist up allows you to get a precise line every time. Highly recommend!",
