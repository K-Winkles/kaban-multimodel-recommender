There is so much room in this bag. I can open it up and immediately find anything I need. There is room for assorted first aid creams in the slots for makeup brushes. Also surgical scissors and several different kinds of tweezers. I left in the detachable divider in the bottom. One side has boxes of different kinds and sizes of bandages, and various wound coverings. The other side holds assorted sizes of elastic bandages, a sling and my tennis elbow brace for when that flares up. The mesh sections hold paper tape and regular tape to hold on bandages. I even have one of those little eye glass cups for washing something out of your eye. Where is that when you need it? I have so many different things in this bag I can't name them all and yet I could fit more.This bag is durable and will last a long time for what I'm using it for. I did cut some red waterproof tape and put crosses on it. The only thing I would change would be to make the handle just a little bit bigger so a man's hand would fit it easier. It's a great bag and worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "This travel makeup bag is great for people on-the-go or anyone who travels. The portable handle and lightweight design make it suitcase-friendly and easy to carry, and the interior is big enough to hold all my essentials for a weekend trip or daily use. I love its thoughtful organization. The separate brush compartment keeps my brushes clean and organized an the clear lining protects my tools from powder dust. The large clear pocket on the top flap holds my eyeshadow palettes, and two big mesh pockets on the second layer flap provide additional makeup storage. Inside the makeup bag is a spacious interior with a detachable divider, to help organize my other cosmetics. Two small mesh sections and the elastic sections keep everything in place, while the main compartment allows for the storage of oversized items (like a small blow dryer). Overall it\u2019s a great find for keeping my essentials at the ready.",

                "reviewText": "I received this bag in black with gold zippers. The color combination of black and gold really makes the bag stand out. The bag has separate compartments for brushes, makeup, powders, sponges, tweezers, etc. The top portion of the zippered bag, has a zippered compartment when you open it. and 8 small compartments to hold your brushes. The thick plastic material inside of the bag, makes it easy to wipe it clean when needed.The second zipper is the larger portion of the makeup bag with 2 netting compartments to store sponges or whatever you prefer, I use mine for makeup wipes. The large bottom portion holds a lot more and can also be separated by a divider that can be used as a separator held by velcro on each side of the bag. The divider has 2 netting pockets on one side and the other side of the divider has more separate spaces to place items that need to be held in place.It's a beautiful bag that serves its purpose, I would certainly recommend this bag and it's a great gift idea.",

It's on the larger size which is perfect for my everyday needs, keeping things organized and in one place. I would not consider it a bag for travel as in my opinion, it would take up too much space for my preferences as I use a backpack and roll-on suitcase, and I hate checking my luggage. If you travel and check then this would fit in a standard suitcase with no issue. It's well organized and perfect on my counter but can be slid under the cabinet out of the way when needed.",
