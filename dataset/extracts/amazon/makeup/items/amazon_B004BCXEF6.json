As long as you have your eyelashes dry you should be able to put this product on easily and quickly. If you smear a bit on your eyelid you can always use a dry cotton swab stick to remove it (just learned that trick---I used to always wet the swab stick). I also love how cheaper this product is versus the amount I have to pay at a local pharmacy. I recommend this product to those who barely have any eyelashes. It works great for me (makes me look like I HAVE eyelashes).",

                "reviewText": "I have a make-up artist friend who RAVES about this mascara. She goes through mascara tubes like crazy for photo shoots and commercials. She says that at the rate that she goes through mascara, she has to use a budget-friendly mascara. She says that this works.My opinion: the formula is very thick. I had to wipe the wand on a paper towel to clean it off. If I applied it directly to my eyelashes, I would end up with a big clump of black mascara and would likely touch my eyelid and end up with a big mess. I prefer to clean off the wand really well and then layer coats of mascara on. This requires patience and discipline but I never regret doing it (when I do it).I have oily skin and finds that this will leave a lash imprint on my upper eyelids.TIP: If you use setting spray, spray your face when you do not have any mascara on. Also, if you have an eyelash comb, put some setting powder on it and comb it through your lashes after you apply mascara. This will help set the wet mascara and reduce the likelihood of smudging.RECOMMENDATION: Based on the reasonable price and all the rave reviews, I would give this a try. It\u2019s worth trying it to see if this is a budget-friendly and easy-to-find in a drugstore mascara that works for you.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always on the hunt for a good copper/burgundy eyeliner because those colors really make my eyes pop. Burgundy is always a challenge because it's usually too red making it look like you have pink eye. I opted to give this mascara a try and it does not disappoint, it's a very subtle color most folks wouldn't immediately notice it's not black or brown but it does enhance eyes beautifully. I also like that it's not over the top clumpy as many voluminous mascaras are because i have curly lashes which makes lashes clump naturally so volumizing mascaras give me uni-lash.",
