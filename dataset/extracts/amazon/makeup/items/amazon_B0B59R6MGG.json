The puffy sponge applicator is soft and easy to use. I would compare this to good quality top selling concealers like Tarte, Laura Geller and IT Cosmetics.",

                "reviewText": "My quest to find the best concealer has finally cone to an end. Almost all concealers in the market are geared toward younger skins. They crease or crack by the end of the day. This product is very lightweight, not greasy and not drying at the same time, and it doesn't settle in wrinkles. It looks beautiful and natural. Additionally, it's free of toxins and the price is amazing.",
