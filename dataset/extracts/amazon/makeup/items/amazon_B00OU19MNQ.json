Preferably use a brush to apply for better, use green & darkest beige color, and use other lighter color for eye area to brighten. All in one pallet! Convinient! All useful colors! Will buy again.Upfate: I like this but I keep getting acnes where I use this. I really like the pallet of color, but this maybe little too heavy for me based on how my skin reacts. My skin is prone to acne, so if you have normal skin, maybe ok, but most people buy this to hide unwanted spots so just wanted through this out there.",

                "reviewText": "If you have come across this review and know how to use color corrector concealer then the first part is for you. If you are someone that has come across this review and are wondering what on earth these crazy colors are used for, then you will want to read to the end.PLEASE NOTE: I have fair-light skin so my review and advice is based on how it works for my skin tone.I have a pretty even skin tone, but I do get Botox. From time to time I am left with slight bruising or red marks. Covering those was my main motivation to purchase.I really love the size and color variety of the compact. It fits perfectly in my case and I don\u2019t need to take with me multiple concealers.In a warmer environment/when the product is warm, it mixes really well. I am even able to mix it into my everyday concealer.The product is very heavy and thick so a little is all you need. It definitely stays put and even at the end of the day everything is in place. I like the thick creamy consistency for covering bruises, injection sites, scars, zits etc. But I really struggled with it when it came to under my eyes. No matter how little I used and how much I blended it out, it never sat right. It sits in wrinkles and lines I didn\u2019t even know existed! My skin type is \u2018normal\u2019 but it made my under eyes look very cakey and dry.It is my holy grail for covering minor imperfections. I can create a layered color most of the time and eliminate needing my regular concealer for those areas.I am not an everyday foundation wearer and this product hasn\u2019t required me to become one. It does the job!It would have been a bonus if it had worked under my eyes. However for what I purchased it for it works fantastic!So if you are someone that sees these crazy palettes with orange and purple and take off running to grab the concealer in you shade\u2026the rest of this review is for you.Color correctors really aren\u2019t as daunting as they look. With a bit of practice, they will become one of the most important pieces in your make-up case.So how do they work? Well each of those crazy colors has opposites. Remember the color wheel in art class? When you use the two opposite colors together you neutralize them.We all want to have that perfect flawless skin, but most of us don\u2019t. Have you put your concealer under your eyes and no matter how much you have applied you still look like you have purple bruises under them? That is because your concealer matches your skin tone, which isn\u2019t your usual skin tone in that area. Fear not! We can solve the problem. We neutralize those imperfections. Once you do that you have an even-toned surface to apply your skin-colored concealer.Red zits staring at you despite layers of concealer? Not a problem, neutralize those with the green. Under-eyes look sallow, purple, and sunken in? Brighten those up with yellow. Look at whatever you want to hide on your face and pay attention to the color, then you can use the right shade to neutralize the issue.If you are unsure exactly what color to neutralize, experiment. Not sure if it\u2019s purple or blue? Then try a thin layer of yellow corrector in one area and orange in the other. Make sure you blend it out well and then apply your concealer over the top. You can then see which looks the best. If you need to, mix the colors!The color that people see the most but fear the most is that dreaded green! You hear that\u2019s what you should use to cover up that glowing red zit that appeared overnight, but when you have done so you are left with an even uglier green mark on your face. No matter how much concealer you put over it, the color still doesn\u2019t look right it looks green. It may seem like an impossible fix but it is a really easy one to solve.The first tip is less is more. Start with a really small amount. You are trying to neutralize the red> Remember your skin is still going to look green. However, we want a HINT of green not full-blown Halloween makeup. If in doubt, blend out more. You may think you have blended it out enough but a lot of the time that isn\u2019t the case. Start with a really tiny amount and work up if needed. Then you can go ahead and place your normal concealer over the top. It is possible to do it the other way around but much more tricky.My favorite (and much easier method if the product is workable) is to mix the green with your everyday concealer. The goal is to make it look like your regular concealer but with just a slight hint of green. Once applied the green and the red will neutralize and it will look just like your skin-colored concealer",

                "reviewText": "It was smaller than I was anticipating so my contour brush didn\u2019t work for application. I tried using multiple different smaller brushes but they wouldn\u2019t pick up the product at all. The only way I could apply a decent amount at first was by using my finger. Once I covered my face and blended, the coverage was so light it was like I hadn\u2019t applied any at all. I put another application of the highlight and contour and could still barely see a difference. I\u2019ll try other brushes to see if I have more success and will update my review accordingly.Update: when applied in conjunction with the rest of my makeup it created a very smooth natural look and was quite light and comfortable. I only wore it for a few hours but noticed my face was less greasy than when I use my usual makeup. Using a silicone sponge was the best way I found to apply the product.",
