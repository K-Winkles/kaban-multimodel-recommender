I\u2019ve tried traditional pencils, stamps, eyeshadows and gel pencils. Until I found this product my go to was Too Faced pomade In a pencil (picture to the left)., but that was starting to give a crusty texture. So when I saw this product I wanted to give it a shot. So glad I did. I\u2019m a red head and the caramel matched perfectly (pictured right). It goes on with ease and washes off the same. My one complaint is that instead of giving a black eyeliner that they offer the eyeliner in the same color as the pomade.",

                "reviewText": "I've been living in Eyebrow Hell for several years. Yep, so is girls who were teenagers in the 70s all over-plucked oureyebrows..oh excuse me...I was told by my hairdresser to call it Tweezing. She says, \" You pluck a chicken, you tweeze your brows\ud83d\ude02 Fast forward 30-40 years and we barely have anything left to tweeze! I have the front parts left... the lil patch of hair closest to our nose... and that is getting thinner with age. I've been drawing on my eyebrows for years with just drug store pencils. Well. I want more. I checked into Micro- blading. $650\ud83d\ude33 Then I tried these little tiny jars the size of quarters, \"gel\". It was great at first but the stuff dries out and it becomes thick and hard to use. Then those amazing Stamps were invented. I got some. The lightest color they had was \"Med. Brown\". Holding the stencil where your eyebrows are is really hard using 2 fingers. I placed the stencil and Stamped and...OMG!! I looked likeGroucho Marx! It was BLACK and the stencil was HUGE!! It came with 6 stencils and they all looked the same. Anyway.. then I found some Eyebrow Tattoo stuff you are supposed to paint on, wait 2-6 hours then \"peel\" off the..stuff.. and baby let me tell you what. I need to start reading reviews. If I had I would have NEVER gotten these things. There was NO PEELING! There was ripping, tearing, crying, swearing and just the worst stuff ever. What few brow hairs i DID have were torn off my face with that crap. And there was NO TATTOO! I Looked Like a Drag Queen Before she paints her face (In in love with RuePaul's Dragrace so I know a thing or two about Drag Queens and i Love them all. Ok so.. now I have 4 hairs left to work with on each brow and I found LAVONE. Oh my Stars!! This is what I've been looking for, for years! It's really great stuff!! I basically paint on my brows. I use eyeshadow primer first then I paint them on and they will last a day or two at least. I've gone longer but with touch ups. They have a great color selection. I use \"Warm Brown\". I also ordered \"Taupe \" just to be sure i had the right color. I'm not Taupe, Warm Brown is perfect. It comes with a tiny brow brush, (I use my own) and a beautiful eyeliner...I have up trying to do that years ago. It also comes with a twist up classic brow pencil with a lil Spoolie at the other end. This is called Pomade. Its so smooth and creamy. Very easy to apply. When it dries it STAYS ON ALL DAY and the next day! ...As long as you use primer. It's not coming off unless you want it off. I've used coconut oil for EVERYTHING!! Makeup remover moisturizer, suntan oil, leather conditioner. Dental Pulling (Google that girls.. once you start you'll never stop. It's VERY GOOD for your dental hygiene )Well that's all. I hope you buy and try this kit. It's the answer to my prayers!! I'm not ever going to stop buying this. It's price is VERY REASONABLE!! What's $15 when it comes to looking fabulous at any age. I'm 65 and I'm always having to pull out my I.D. to prove my age to someone. It's the best compliment I get! Enjoy!!",

The pencil was also great, doesn't break easily, has a eyeliner stamp looking shape for several techniques with different angles. Great kit to create the perfect brow",
