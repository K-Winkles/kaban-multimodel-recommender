                "reviewText": "I have sensitive eyes and was looking for something that would take what little makeup I wear (a little eyeliner, mascara, brow pencil) off easily, no scrubbing, & with no irritation. After reading multiple reviews, I chose the Cetaphil.I have used this for many days (3 blurps on a cotton pad) and this is what I have noticed. 1] to remove ALL of the neutrogena mascara, I either have to hold the pad on my eye to let the mascara 'soak' or I resort to light scrubbing. 2] more product on the cotton pad doesn't help remove anything any better 3] Even though this is oil-free, there is an 'oily' feeling that is left around my eyes. It does not matter how much or little product is used. 4] rinsing my face with water after, as the directions state, doesn't take away that feeling. 5] this caused some of the skin around my eye to feel irritated and slightly red.Conclusion: a] does remove makeup, but seems to not do well with mascara b] have to wash my face after using to remove oily feeling c] somewhat irritating to skin. I can use this, just not everyday. You may have different results.",

These worked well and my face did not break out, so it appears that it really is non comedogenic. It also made my skin soft.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this product is convenient to throw into a travel bag, gym bag or larger purse. They\u2019re larger than other wipes I\u2019ve used, which is nice! They did not cause me to break out or burn my sensitive skin. It doesn\u2019t remove a full face of makeup for me but it is good for removing mascara and eye makeup without burning my eyes. I found that I can\u2019t use it alone to remove a full face of makeup and still have to wash my face after but they\u2019re convenient and remove enough to use quickly to get most makeup off if you\u2019re in a hurry or exhausted and just want to get to sleep haha. However, there is still some makeup residue on my skin after use unless I use several wipes. They do tend to dry my skin a little bit so I have to moisturize a little extra after use. They\u2019d be great to use after the gym to wipe off sweat or first thing in the morning for a quick clean before makeup. While a little drying for me, if you don\u2019t struggle with extremely dry skin you might not have a problem with that. That being said, even though it was drying it didn\u2019t irritate or cause issues as long as I moisturized really good after. They\u2019re great to cleanse face for reasons other than makeup unless you only have a little on. I have used them on my 6yo daughter once or twice to get her makeup off when she\u2019s been playing with it, and there was no burning or irritation. They are effective at removing lipstick. (Or stray lipstick on a little girl who can\u2019t quite keep it on her lips).",
