My skin is not sensitive, but I like this makeup because when I put it on, I feel that it matches my skin color yet covers age spots and evens out my skin tone. It is creamy, and I apply it with a sponge. I used to buy more expensive makeup but the Prescriptives brand I purchased went out of stock. Its make up matched perfectly. This CoverGirl makeup has been the best replacement I have found, and the price is right. I hope Amazon keeps carrying it.",

It was an exact perfect shade match for me, goes on smooth, has a medium, buildable coverage, doesn't feel heavy at all and works well with contouring, bronzing and blushes, powder and liquid. I can wear it with some powder over it or just as is and it looks great. It really did surprise me how well this product works for my skin, which I'm so thankful for because it's aggravating trying to find the perfect shade along with how it feels, etc. I have a combination skin and it doesn't seem to be an issue, it didn't settle in my fine lines and form any cracks, it does stay put all day for me, but I do use a setting spray. I will be buying again and again and again....",

I have very dry skin despite moisturizing with good products daily. Also it\u2019s winter and that\u2019s not helping. So to have something that covers up my flaws and makes my skin look healthy is great. It\u2019s pale enough for me to wear it and look natural. On quick days I simply put out under my eyes and boom: I look like I\u2019ve slept more often than not. Which is definitely not true! Highly recommend.",

This seems to be holding up well to wear, and does not seem to be causing my skin to break out (although I\u2019d prefer a fragrance free option, seriously!) my skin is oily/combo/acne prone, and I\u2019m in my mid thirties now so starting to get the dreaded fine lines, but this covers blemishes really well without settling into those lines. It gets a little more dewy throughout the day but nothing some blotting paper can\u2019t handle. Overall I will definitely buy again because it\u2019s such a good value!",
