I have light skin tone so I chose the light color to blend and it matched my skin perfectly. I don't wear much for make up just need to cover up dark circles under my eyes and a little dark spot near my cheek this worked great, I did however have to put on a little moisturizer so it would go on nice and smoothly. It covered my dark under eyes very well and dark spots too. This is really good stuff, it didn't make me break out and looked like I had nothing on as it matched so good. I would definitely recommend this to all that have any dark spots, imperfections or anything you may want to conceal as it works super good. It worked for me and the cost is low too. I would have paid more ! I have for products that didn't work as well.",

I can dot it on my face or put some on my finger to apply The coverage is fabulous, not greasy and blends so well. I've never had anything like this and I have used the bottle, the brush, the compact, etc. It just disappears and the redness, darkness under my eyes and spots are gone. Yay!",

                "reviewText": "Accidentally. Heh.I was preparing for a trip and in a bit of a last minute panic mode for items I needed to purchase. Without realizing, I ordered this concealer in two different orders. I was going to send one back, but when I tried it and it worked so well, I decided I would keep it.Now, I don\u2019t always wear makeup, but this has lasted almost 6 months! I use a bit under my eyes and nose, and one little spot where I have some sun damage. (Or just\u2026 an age spot! :\u2019^{ ) Even though I don\u2019t use a ton, I still think that\u2019s a great value for the money.It has a fun/neat twist and click to get more product, and it\u2019s really easy to see the amount you have left since the container is clear. (Though the label can get in the way a bit.)I have included a picture of a bit on my hand and then how it blends. Not because one usually wears makeup on their hands, but I wanted to show the product \u201cin action.\u201d I know I took pics of my face \u2018before and after\u2019 when I first got it, but that\u2019s now buried deep in 5+ months of pictures. Amazon\u2019s review page is super annoying for scrolling, finding, and selecting pics/videos.I want to finally get this posted to help any others considering. I\u2019ll start my second tube soon, and I\u2019m happy with the concealer. I recommend!",
