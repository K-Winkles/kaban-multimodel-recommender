There's a sheer wash of color, I paired mine with a brown lip liner and it looked great, and surprisingly lasted a decent amount of time! For a lip oil, that's crazy good!!! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!",

                "reviewText": "This is the first lip oil I\u2019ve ever tried, and I\u2019m in love with it. I love the color, the smell, and the feel of it. The tint lasts the entire day (though the glossiness doesn\u2019t), so I don\u2019t need to reapply it. The smell is amazing. I do not use this word lightly. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but the people I\u2019ve asked said it smells like cherry, even though I usually despise that scent and taste. The feel of it on my lips is great, too. I love how it\u2019s a little thick, but not too much. I usually pair it with a Sephora lip liner, and I love the combination.Now, the negative side: the packaging. It isn\u2019t a big issue that causes the actual product to be used with difficulty. It\u2019s more of my pickininess with the color. The lid is a bit too green for my liking, the bottle is too big for the actual amount of product, and the stopper takes out too much product (for me, at least). The bright green lid was initially a little offputting to me before I bought it, but after seeing several people compliment it, I decided to try it. It also immediately tells people what product you\u2019re using. For example, I was in class one day, and I saw this girl discretely take it out of here bag and apply it, and her hands were covering the bottle from view. Because the big, bright green cap was peeking out between her fingers, I immediately knew what product her wws using without even asking. I don\u2019t know if this is a good or bad thing, but I like to be more discrete with what I use, so I don\u2019t like applying it during class because the bright green makes it so easy for the product to catch people\u2019s eyes. However, if you don\u2019t mind it, then go ahead and buy this product because it is amazing. Another thing I dislike is how big the bottle is. It isn\u2019t easy to fit in you pocket, and if it does fit, it leaves a huge, obvious bulge. The last thing is the stopper. I don\u2019t know how the relationship between lip gloss/oil\u2019s stoppers and applicators works, but this take out too much for me, so I dab the extra drop on my bottom lip, then spread the remainder on my top, then go back to the bottom with the side. It isn\u2019t terrible, but it does leave a bit of a mess on top of the stopper when I put the applicator back.Overall, I absolutely love this lip oil, and I would 10/10 buy it again, despite my dislike of the packaging.",

The product promises 12-hour hydration, and it delivers. My lips feel moisturized throughout the day, which is a big win for me as I often struggle with dry lips.The texture is one of its best features. It\u2019s non-sticky, a significant departure from many lip glosses that can feel tacky. This makes it comfortable to wear for extended periods.The color 02 MISSED CALL is a lovely pink shade that provides a subtle but noticeable tint. It enhances the natural color of my lips without being overpowering, making it perfect for both everyday wear and special occasions.The vegan formula is another aspect I appreciate, aligning with my preference for cruelty-free and environmentally conscious beauty products.The gloss applies smoothly, and the packaging is both functional and stylish, fitting easily into a purse or makeup bag.My reason for giving it four stars instead of five is its longevity. While it hydrates for hours, I find the need to reapply the gloss for maintaining the color, as it doesn\u2019t last as long as the hydration does.In summary, the NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil Lip Drip in 02 MISSED CALL is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a hydrating, non-sticky lip gloss with a hint of color. It\u2019s a versatile product that can elevate your daily makeup look while providing lasting comfort.",

On the description it says that it doesn\u2019t stick so obviously I assumed that\u2019s true but when I got and tried it it actually does. It\u2019s just like lipgloss, it\u2019s not really a lip oil to me.",
