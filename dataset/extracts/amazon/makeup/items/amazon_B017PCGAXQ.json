                "reviewText": "I wanted to move away from using make-up wipes as often to remove my eye make-up so I bought this and some soft cloths. I am impressed with this product. I have sensitive eyes/allergies and this doesn't affect them too much when I get a little in my eyes. I am not saying this doesn't take any effort to remove all the eye make-up but even the wipes do. I shake the bottle, squeeze some on a soft cloth, use it on one eye, then get another part of the cloth wet with water and wipe my eye again; repeat for other eye. If you have a lot of make-up on it may take a little back and forth of these steps, especially with the type of cloth I am using. I need to experiment with different cloths I think. Thinner may work better but I chose a thicker, softer cloth so my sensitive eye skin would not be aggravated.This does seem oily although they do not say there is oil in the product. I don't see a problem with this although if you plan to use it on your entire face and break out easily, I would test it first in an area.An interesting discovery with this product is that it also works on other substances you may get on yourself that soap will not easily remove. I was spray painting a bunch of items and multiple times got dark spray paint on my legs or hands. I tried this product with a cotton ball and it removed the paint with little effort! I was pretty impressed and it goes to show it can remove mascara if it can remove spray paint! I plan to continue to use this product and would recommend it as long as you are aware that it does feel oily and you do need to shake it each time.",
