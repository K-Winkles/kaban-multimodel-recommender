                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good product. Would buy again.",
                "reviewText": "PREFACE: I\u2019m someone who enjoys makeup, but I don\u2019t like spending too much. So I\u2019ll try to make my review as honest as possible. I\u2019ll provide a short & long review depending on the type of buyer you are.SHORT REVIEW: Item is a good value for the price. Good pigment, removal requires a little extra effort, good wear time. Product does crease, dries fast, has a pleasant smell that I can\u2019t quite name. Overall, have realistic expectations & you\u2019re fine.***IN-DEPTH REVIEW***ITEM: Set B (warmer tones); 6 liners & 6 matte liquid lipsticks.IMAGE: I swatched them on my wrist. The numbers are the lip liners in the order they are in the package. To the right of those are the lipsticks. 2 swatches per lipstick, upper line is one coat, lower line is 2 coats. Took some in natural light, with flash, and in sunlight.PACKAGING: Packaging is pretty, love the holographic shift on the box. It\u2019s nothing super fancy, but you\u2019re paying $12.88; so humble yourself and have realistic expectations.SKIN TONE: This is for my POC that worry about shades that seem to be made with white-skinned consumers in mind. I\u2019m a biracial young lady, so my skin is about a light/medium brown, my undertone is more warm. My skin tone is similar to peanut butter, caramel in the summer. I like these shades on myself & I have no doubt that it will look great on all skin tones dark to light. The first shade matches my natural lip color the best which I would say is a dusty pink.APPEARANCE: They have good pigment, I\u2019m satisfied as a buyer. The color you see in the tube is almost exactly the same as when it dries. The only reason it looks different is bc in the tube it isn\u2019t in it\u2019s dried state. This matte lipstick does have creasing, but that\u2019s what you get with a lot of matte cream products. You should expect this with this price-point, and I personally don\u2019t mind the creasing too much. Creasing will be worse if you start with dry lips.CLEANING/REMOVAL: For me I had a difficult time removing after having it applied for maybe 5 min. I first tried with just water to test it\u2019s ease, after scrubbing with that for a few secs it still pretty much looked fully intact. When I used some soapy remover it came off quickly and was a little messy, but that\u2019s what happens when you remove makeup. Overall I say cleaning is about the difficulty you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s a matte lipstick; it\u2019s going to take a little extra effort to remove. But it\u2019s difficulty to remove plays well into the longevity of wear.LONGEVITY: Didn\u2019t wear for long since I was just testing them all in one go. But they dried quickly on my lips (within 60 sec). Considering the effort it takes to remove, I imagine it would last quite well throughout your day without too much reapplication. I say that longevity greatly depends on your initial application. If you\u2019ve done some moisturizing lip-care beforehand, then applied a regular coat, then allow it to SET before applying a 2nd coat, then it will last longer and feel more comfortable. If you were to begin with dry lips, rush the additional coat(s), and apply too much in a single coat, that\u2019s when you get a tacky feel, clumping, inconsistency, etc.FEEL/TEXTURE: The texture is smooth, creamy as you apply and when it dries it\u2019s y\u2019know\u2026 dry. That\u2019s what you get with matte lipsticks, so it\u2019s no surprise. Matte product= no shine= dry.Value: Overall value I would say is good in general and for the price. Keep in mind I\u2019m not an avid lipstick buyer, so I\u2019m no expert, but I have a good enough knowledge of makeup to leave a decent review. I\u2019d say if you\u2019re someone who is realistic with expectations and understands you aren\u2019t going to get these products at runway-model quality for 12 bucks, you\u2019re good to go. A lot of people that leave negative reviews seem to be people who want a perfect product at the price of a penny. No product can do it all, but if this product doesn\u2019t satisfy you, set realistic goals about what you\u2019d like to spend and what you want to receive.",

                "reviewText": "The colors where far from what is displayed. That may be an issue with color settings on my phone, but I seriously doubt it. All of the liquid had a very heavy orange base or really pink. I don't wear either. I was excited to get then when I ordered them as the ad shows beautiful colors. The liners aren't very pigmented. The lipsticks had a strange odor. Not offensive, but not pleasant right under my nose. I tried each color say least 2 times to be fair. I ended up trashing all of them within a week. The liquid color one applied and dried was pretty long lasting. Pretty transfer resistant. This wood be a good feeling off you like the colors you end up with. I believe there was something in the description from the seller that said that there might be a difference in the color between the monitor you're looking at and in actuality. So really I mean nothing bad to say about the seller and other than the color and the smell nothing terribly bad to say about the product. But it wasn't for me.",

                "reviewText": "Still using these and really enjoy the different color combinations that can be done with it. Its basically two-three different colors but in a palette shade scale so you can combine different combinations to achieve different looks. They are pretty nice and it is light weight and comfortable. They will if pressed on certain materials come off and do wash off easily but normal wear is good and honestly when compared to other products of the same type makeup out there these have stayed longer on my lips then anything I've tried in 40 years anyway. Would purchase again as needed.",

                "reviewText": "I love eye and lip makeup but due to age and health reasons I hadn't worn lip liner & lipstick very often at all for a few years. I wanted a lip kit that had both liner and matching color in the set. Every brand I've heard of, was soooo expensive and for just one color!! So I started looking at sets that had more than one color in them, but by companies I hadn't heard of. I read so many reviews on so many of them and every single brand had a mix of good and bad. I was so overwhelmed that I finally just closed off the amazon tab on my desktop & told my mom and daughter to forget it, I wasn't going to order any lol. The next day I sat down and went through everything again, then finally decided to just go ahead and try this one.From reading reviews I expected the colors to be darker than what I thought they'd be. They weren't though! They were pretty much exactly what one would expect from looking at them on the product details. Ok, now on to the longevity of it! Again, I was SHOCKED! I use a lip primer by a different brand. It has a primer on one end and a lip plumper on the other end. So I'm not sure how great it may or may not be without using primer. For me though, I put it on and wait about 5 minutes or so before taking a sip of anything or smoking a cigarette (yeah, yeah I know ..it's a nasty habit lol). I do get a little residual stain on the straw or the cigarette but not a lot. I put it on before leaving my house to go door dashing, and when I come home after 4-6 hours, it still looks ok! -Not great, but ok. Great for as much as I put it through in that time period though! Drinking constantly, snacking on food while driving, smoking cigs, talking and smiling a lot! It doesn't cake or crack on me either!The ONLY downfall at all that I've found, is that the colors and liners don't have which one they are marked on them, so if you don't want to keep them in the case, where they come side by side, you may have a hard time figuring out which liner is an exact match to which color, as some are pretty similar. For the price, I HIGHLY recommend this and think it'd make a great gift too! I think the recipient would really like this, and it definitely won't break your bank buying the gift!! I also gave it a middle mark for the moisturizing category, because I don't feel that it really moisturizes my lips very much, but I also don't feel like it dries them out either. Again, I do recommend!!",
