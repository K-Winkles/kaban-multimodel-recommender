                "reviewText": "I have a set of expensive and well-made makeup brushes that I purchased from Prescriptives over two decades ago. I was taught then to always wash the brushes with regular shampoo (never baby shampoo!) and tepid to warm water and lay them flat on a towel to dry. Prescriptives had a lifetime guarantee to replace the brushes for free, and of course Estee Lauder has now discontinued Prescriptives, so I've tried very diligently to preserve the brushes I have with the greatest of gentle care. I store them between uses upright in an enclosed box and keep them in a cabinet when not in use to ensure no excessive exposure to light. I wanted to try this silicone cleaner because it allows for drying of the brushes to occur with the brush end down, which offers a quicker method of drying than lying them flat. The basket is easy to assemble and use. Just. fill with a capful or two of regular shampoo and then fill the basket with warm water. You can gently swish the brush around in the soapy solution and carefully and lightly scrub against the base of the basket to clean the brush strands and dislodge makeup, etc. I like to rinse the brush several times under warm running water until the water runs clear. It also may be necessary to repeat the washing process in the basket one or two times, depending on how dirty the brushes are with dried foundation or lipstick. Once the brushes are clean, empty the basket and rinse it out, then turn it upside down and place your brushes handle end down into the bottom of the basket. The basket \"holes\" vary in size to accommodate the smallest brush handle diameter to the largest. Then hang the basket up with the provided hook to drip and air dry. I place a towel underneath to keep the counter dry. Once dry, store your brushes ready and clean for the next use.",

But it is more efficient to clean my makeup brushes in this bowl than to just wash them by hand. I just add a blob of shampoo and hot water and scrub the brushes on the bottom of the bowl. The textured bottom does a good job of cleaning the bristles. Unfortunately, the light peachy pink color of the bowl stains easily, and I am not able to get the stains out. Because of this, I avoid cleaning my eye makeup brushes in this bowl. I like the idea of sticking the brush handles in the bottom of the bowl to let them air dry. Unfortunately, half of my brush handles are too big to fit in the holes (see picture). The heart hook is cute and a nice touch.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this! I'm using it mostly for washing my paint brushes. I don't use makeup brushes too often. That being said, they should STILL be cleaned! This is perfect for both. You can wash/agitate in the little bowl and hang them upside down after cleaning, flip it back around, and it's storage. Great! I'll be able to use it for so many purposes. I hate when something just sits there waiting to be used a few times a year. But, this is like a blank canvas, just do what you want with it really! I'm trying to figure out how I could even use it for Cricut supplies....",

My brushes can get really gross after a few uses but whenever I cleaned them, I never felt like they were getting clean enough. Having this little cleaning bucket had been super helpful. The textured bottoms allow me to really get into the bristles to get the very ends clean. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars us because the holes that you can stick your brushes in are too small for some of my fatter brushes",

I just put some water and soap in the bowl, attach the brush to the spinner, and press the button. It spins the brush and removes all the dirt and makeup residue. The mat is also very handy for drying the brushes. It has different textures for different types of brushes and it's very soft and gentle. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their brushes clean and hygienic.",
