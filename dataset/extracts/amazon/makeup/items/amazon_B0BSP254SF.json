I put it on before my foundation this morning and it worked beautifully. I could hardly believe my eyes. The dark areas under my eyes just disappeared and made me look at least 10 years younger. The product left my skin looking very natural. THANK YOU!",

I decided to try this from a commercial, and I am glad that I didFirst, as a brown skin girl, the color match is perfect. It doesn't leave my skin looking orange. A little bit goes a long way, and the applicator is cute.The price was awesome and it arrived super early. I have many other ELF stuff, and to me, they never disappoint. I like this color corrector and will try all the others as well.Hope this helps.",

It is pigmented more than green primers I had tried in the past but not too Shrek-like (like the L.A. Girl Pro corrector).The product is a little on the thin side, but is buildable and easy to apply. I dot in on my red areas (chin, nose) and blend it in with a small flat brush (but fingers would work just fine). It is crazy how my red is neutralized instantly. My foundation looks so much better now that I am starting with a neutral-colored base. My foundation actually appears less patchy.",
