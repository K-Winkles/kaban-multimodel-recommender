The fragrance is very nice and light though, a clean smell. Just beware that this is a very small TRIAL size. I read that when I bought it and was fully prepared, but I laughed when I opened the package because it\u2019s soooo so tiny and cute! There is plenty of product though, it will last and go a long way. You only need a tiny dab of everything, it spreads well. Leaves my skin so hydrated and soft, with a dewy glow to it. I just have a little trouble opening and screwing the lids back on because of how small they are. This kit is great for starters to skincare or if you want to just try out something new. Love it so far!",
