The smell is kind of heavy, always has been. It's a pleasant smell however, full of nostalgia and pleasant memories.I use the puff and push the powder into my skin rather than brush over it with a brush like I did when I was younger. This powder blurrs like a filter, leaving skin flawless.Unless you're sensitive to fragrance you will love love this powder.",

                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2606 (4/5)Finding the perfect setting powder is essential if you want to get that flawless skin you've always wanted. Airspun Loose Powder Translucent came highly recommended, so I had to give it a shot. Believe me when I say that the hype is justified. This powder has become an absolute must-have for me because of its silky smooth texture and excellent mattifying properties.The unique texture of Airspun Loose Powder Translucent is one of its most defining characteristics. The powder has a luxuriously smooth texture that makes it a breeze to apply. It applies smoothly and evenly to my skin and blends in perfectly with my foundation. The finely milled blend gives the powder its silky feel and keeps it from looking cakey or heavy on the skin. It's revolutionary for those of us who value coverage as highly as we value a natural look.When it comes to sheerness, the transparent shade is a clear winner. Having fair complexion makes it difficult to find a setting powder that doesn't change the shade of my makeup. Instead of adding color, the Airspun powder only sets my makeup. For individuals who like their makeup to look more subtle, or who have trouble selecting their right shade, this is a major benefit.The mattifying abilities of Airspun Loose Powder Translucent, however, are what set it different from other loose powders. Always having oily skin has been my biggest beauty challenge. But after using this powder, my makeup stays on for hours longer than before. It sets my concealer and makeup so they don't budge all day. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my makeup stays in even on the warmest, muggiest days.The powder's ability to conceal blemishes also came as a nice surprise. The use of Airspun powder has been shown to have a miraculous effect on the appearance of fine wrinkles, pores, and other minor imperfections. The soft-focus appearance it gives is a nice bonus, but it can't replace good skincare or full-coverage concealer. It helps even out my skin tone and provides a more even surface for the remainder of my makeup to sit on.The package of the translucent Airspun loose powder is worth mentioning. Although the retro style certainly adds some flair, it may not be the most functional option for when you're on the road. Powder has a habit of escaping through the sifter holes, which can lead to unpleasant spills. The powder also has a strong aroma, like an old-fashioned cosmetic. Some people will find it nostalgic, while others who are sensitive to smells may find it overwhelming.Last but not least, I like how reasonable the price is for this product. The Airspun Loose Powder Translucent may be inexpensive, but high-quality setting powders can cost a pretty penny. You receive a lot of product for your money, so it's a good option for cosmetics lovers on a tighter budget.In summary, the Airspun Loose Powder Translucent is a fantastic addition to my beauty arsenal. There is nothing else quite like it when it comes to setting powders thanks to its ultra-fine milling, colorless coverage, mattifying properties, and blurring effects. The performance and the low price more than make up for the small shortcomings of the package and the scent. Airspun is a great option to consider if you need a setting powder that lives up to its claims. Without it, I just can't do my makeup!",

I will say that it does have a bit of a strong smell, it is a good smell! However if you wear a particular body spray/perfume you might want to make sure the smells don\u2019t clash.",

The size is definitely what is steering me to loving this product as it leaves a nice matte coverage to seal my makeup.For the price, you cannot go wrong!

                "reviewText": "I ordered this powder as a dupe for Laura Mercier (LM) Loose Translucent Powder, which is great but keeps getting more expensive. For the most part, I liked the texture of the Coty Airspun Translucent Powder Extra Coverage. Silky feel. The color was slightly lighter and a tad more pink than my skin., but not too bad. However, my biggest problem was the smell. It is REALLY strong. You can smell the powder before you even open it. I would cough trying to put my powder on with my brush and hold my breath to powder my nose. If you're sensitive to smells, I would not recommend this powder.",
