                "reviewText": "Maybelline has really been stepping up their game these days. In the past, I was not very impressed with their products, but I have found myself gravitating towards them more and more these days. I love their Age Rewind concealers, which blend flawlessly into my skin, their eyeliner, etc, so I decided to give this gloss a shot based on the number of reviews. It did not disappoint. I ordered two neutral shades, \u201cMoon\u201d and another I can\u2019t recall the name of at the moment, and I love them both. First, I love the way the product feels on my lips. They truly feel smooth and hydrated when I\u2019m wearing this, and I feel like my lips don\u2019t feel super sticky like they do with the NYX Butter Glosses I typically wear. I feel like the product also lasts longer than other glosses I\u2019ve tried. Second, visually the gloss looks fantastic after applying it. It makes my lips appear smooth and the color is so nice and natural. I have fleshy colored lips so I feel like the neutral shades I bought looks more natural but definitely gives my lips some color. The only thing I\u2019m not a fan of is the shape of the tube the product comes in. I do feel it\u2019s kind of bulky and I don\u2019t like the edges. I prefer lip gloss tubes that are more cylinder shaped; however, that said I do feel the amount of product that comes in it is pretty generous. Also, you may feel a tingly sensation when applying this. It feels weird at first but does fade after a couple minutes. Overall, this is a product I like and would definitely recommend! I just purchased another in a neutral pink shade, which I\u2019m very excited to try.",

My favorite shade is \u201cice\u201d. Also, after wearing this product consistently for over 1 year, (multiple re-purchases) I believe it has helped keep my lips more moisturized overall. The tubes are also generous portions. All around this product is a 10!",

                "reviewText": "For a drug store brand lip gloss, I am impressed. This is pretty hydrating. It will wear off after 30 min for me and then I have to reapply or apply Aquaphor to keep my lips from getting dry. It leaves a bit of a lip stain which is convenient.The Reef color is pinky/peachy. It\u2019s so hard to see the exact color of a product just by viewing it online.This is worth a try if you like lip glosses. Smells lightly of vanilla and the scent is not annoying.Applies kind of goopy but is not terribly goopy/liquid. Exfoliate your lips before applying. Otherwise, this looks like paint on top of a textured surface. Good color payoff and glossy.My lips have lines and this does not blur lip lines. A lip gloss is not a miracle worker, so I didn\u2019t expect this gloss to completely blur my lip lines.Apply a thin layer and blot with a tissue to deposit the stain/color on your lips. Then apply another very light layer to build up to the color saturation and glossiness that you want. Blot after each layer. If you throw this on your lips without looking, it will look like goopy paint. You have to be patient and apply this on in layers and blot. Before you head out of the house, check whether any color was deposited accidentally on your teeth.RECOMMENDATION: BUY. This is reasonably priced, hydrating lip gloss and worth trying if you enjoy using lip glosses.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty nice lip gloss. There's a pleasant light scent but it has no flavored.It's not too heavy or sticky and feels buttery on the lips and is very comfortable to wear.I read many good things about this gloss and I'd have to say overall it's pretty nice. It seems to last a decent amount of time on the lips.However, I do think it drys my lips just a bit.It has a relatively large doe foot applicator which I actually like more than I thought I would. But my concern is how much does this take away from the amount of product you receive.Although I like this and plan to purchase in a different shade I'm not satisfied with the shade Topaz. It's a very sheer terracotta with very fine shimmer/ pearl. It's not a color I'd normally go for but I saw so many reviews stating it's so pretty, a great dupe, fits all skin tones, and so on.That being said, I am not impressed.The color is average to me and I wouldn't purchase this shade again. It is pretty universal but I don't care for anything that leans towards orange.It doesn't go well with my skin tone. And although fairly sheer it seems to wash me out a bit.I can make it work but I tend to only use it when I'm staying home or running an errand and want something to just put on (Just trying to get rid of it).It looks okay with some lip liner but I'd prefer clear to this shade. Even with my favorite lip liners it doesn't give the look of prefer.I hope they add more shades because overall I really like the product but the colors are pretty average and disappointing.Just for reference-I have medium to tan skin, with neutral under tone.So far not one makeup artist has found a great foundation shade match for me.But I tend to look best in the colors white, black, red, powdery pink, sheer teal.I look terrible in orange, green, grays, burgundy.Hope this this is helpful.",
