                "reviewText": "I LOVE this Pro Glow foundation! It makes me cringe to think about how much money I've wasted over the years between Lancome, Cover FX, Clinique and others when this foundation beats those high-end products in every way AND costs a fraction of the price!For example, the Lancome R\u00e9nergie Lift and Cover FX cream foundations both were great color matches for me, but both required touchups after a few hours even with primer. I loved the look of Cover FX cream foundation on my skin (the dewy glow), but the transfer was terrible. The Lancome matched my color but just looked so dull and needed to be touched up all the time too. Estee Lauder Double Wear had great staying power but settled into my fine lines and crows feet, which made me look older. All of them were expensive, which would be OK if they lived up to their claims.I literally bought this L'Oreal Pro Glow because I knew I wanted to try a new foundation, but most places are not offering samples during Covid 19. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a high-end foundation that might not be the right color etc.So, I watched a lot of great YouTube reviews about the L'Oreal Pro Glow and thought I'd give it a try to just make due for awhile. Instead, I was blown away with how beautiful this foundation was, the way it gave my 46 year-old skin a healthy glow, it never settled into my fine lines, looked radiant and in tact all day (even without primer), and did not cause any breakouts. I was also impressed that it gave me medium-full buildable coverage and looked great upclose or from a distance...never cakey or heavy looking.L'Oreal Pro Glow is now my favorite foundation ever, and the fact that it's so affordable is just incredible. For reference, I am a light-medium skin tone with neutral undertones. My Lancome R\u00e9nergie Lift foundation color was 260, and I was N40 in Cover FX. I have normal skin but break out easily if a product doesn't agree with my skin. The L'Oreal Pro Glo Natural Buff matched me perfectly and made my skin look and feel incredible.Make sure you shake the Pro Glow foundation first. I've used a beauty blender or a foundation brush to apply, and both methods worked great.",

                "reviewText": "So, I've been wearing makeup for fourteen years now and never managed to find a makeup that didn't just look good, but made me feel good, too. Usually they're too cakey or too crumbly or too orange, and I've never found one from neither drug store nor high end retailer that worked with my combination skin. Now I love Pro-Glow so much I have three bottles and don't even know where to start.First and foremost, being completely honest I bought this because the shade I need, Classic Ivory, was half-off. I didn't really have super high expectations. I was tired of the most recent foundation I'd been using and how it made me look SO dry (they have found mummies in tombs with more moisturized faces than mine) so I went ahead and got this in an impulse purchase.The tube itself came as you would get it in a retail store, loose with no unnecessary extra carboard/packaging, with two filler airbags in a cardboard box. I don't know how/why people have complained about the way it's shipped...that's just kind of how the makeup itself is...? No complaints here!As I said before, I have grappled with foundation my entire adult life. My jaw dropped when I put this on. Flawless. I didn't even put the rest of my makeup on before my phone was in my hand ordering two more. I am OBSESSED with the way this foundation looks; I've never felt so pretty and polished before! I'm not huge into makeup, so I don't use concealers or bases or anything unless it's a very special event. I used a thin coat of this Pro-Glow Foundation with a cheap drugstore primer and my skin looks amazing. I'm very, very fair skinned with red blotches and have never found a foundation that can cover my redness even when it's super caked on, but somehow this specific foundation covered it in a nice, thin layer. Unless something drastic happens with my skin, I can legitimately see myself using this exact foundation for years to come.",
