I do recommend paring with some micellar water by soaking your brushes in that first for about an hour or a whole day. Pull each brush out of the cup of micellar water and place just a drop of this shampoo on it and clean it very well. This bottle was full when I received it and had a tamper cover on it which is very important. The smell is pleasant and the performance is outstanding. I wish I had a before and after for these brushes but let\u2019s just say this shampoo did what needed to be done \ud83d\ude0a!!",

                "reviewText": "For the folks who have been leaving 1-star reviews, I think I know what the problem is...because I almost did the same\u2014do NOT USE WITH WATER. I was trying to use it WITH water and I was so disgusted with the results that I was just about to leave a scathing review when I decided to try without the water...and that was the problem all along. Clean without water and use warm water to rinse. If use try to use water WITH the shampoo, it gets too diluted and is, well, useless. I\u2019ve just ordered it for the second time because it works very well with 7 out of 8 of my make up brushes. I took a point off because it never quite gets all the foundation out of my flat brush foundation applicator...and it gets so saturated I\u2019m not sure anything would do any better without soaking, anyway. A little annoying, but\u2014dude...it\u2019s cheap. If I have to go the extra mile for just one of out of all my ridiculous number of vanity tools, I can deal.",
