                "reviewText": "If you're anything like me, you care about your make up not looking caked on and fake. I'm relatively new to the latest makeup trends, but it became very evident to me that a blending sponge is a must have in the daily essentials kit. I'm also the type of online shopper who reads the reviews before making a purchase, especially when it comes to something that is going to touch my face.The RT sponge is just wonderful! Allow me to break it down for you:First, let's talk price: In comparison to the BeautyBlender (because I'm sure you know about it) this sponge is significantly less expensive, I believe the BeautyBlender hovers around $20 where the RT sponge was just under $10. Don't be fooled however, the RT sponge may be short on cash, but it is not short on performance.Size: The RT sponge is rather large, about the size of a small(er) lemon. However, the size assures you that you will get optimum coverage, and I think contributes to the flawless finish.Material: The material of the RealTechniques Sponge reminds me of a memory foam pillow. It's soft to the touch and smooth on the skin. Simply wonderful. The sponge does expand some when it is wet, but not too much. For me, it was just enough! Wetting the sponge contributes to the dewey look I prefer, a vibrant, fresh skin, natural look. One thing I have to say about the RT sponge is it seems to hold water a bit. This isn't a terrible thing, I'd simply recommend allowing it to dry overnight (after cleaning) if you need to use the sponge dry.Shape: The sponge is shaped like a lemon, with one flat, angled edge. The rounded edges are great for blending in foundation on the cheeks or larger areas, where the flat edge is perfect for blending in concealer or areas around the eyes and nose. There's a pointed tip at one end, which is suggested for blending in blemish control (small precise spots).In regard to some of the negative reviews, I can see how the edges of the sponge may fray with a significant amount of use, however, I think it's all about how well you treat your sponge. If you leave it laying around, or banging in the bottom of your cosmetic case, it's going to rip. If you keep it safely in your beauty bag, I think the lifespan of this sponge could really surprise you.All in all, this sponge seems to be fantastic,it really does deliver a flawless finish.L",
