                "reviewText": "The e.l.f. Hydrating Camo Concealer is a game-changer in my makeup routine. It combines the best of both worlds: lightweight feel and full coverage. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this concealer performed.Firstly, the lightweight formula is a dream to apply. It blends seamlessly and doesn't feel heavy or cakey on the skin. Despite its weightlessness, it manages to provide impressive coverage, effectively concealing imperfections, dark circles, and blemishes.The hydrating aspect is a standout feature. This concealer doesn't dry out my skin or settle into fine lines. Instead, it keeps my under-eye area looking fresh and hydrated throughout the day, which is a huge win for me.The shade range is extensive, making it easy to find the perfect match for your skin tone. Plus, the doe-foot applicator allows for precise application, so you can target specific areas with ease.I've used many concealers in the past, but e.l.f.'s Hydrating Camo Concealer has quickly become one of my favorites. It's a fantastic product that delivers on its promises, offering a natural look with impressive coverage. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable concealer that won't break the bank.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this concealer in two shades at separate times since I wasn't sure what would be best at first. I have very fair skin, prone to redness, and the Fair Rose turned out to be a better match for a concealer for me. The Light Ivory was a bit too dark for a concealer for me. If you compare photos of the two, the Fair Rose is the lighter of the two, and I usually like to use a concealer that is either the same level if not lighter than my foundation.This concealer goes on easily and blends well. A little goes a long way because it is very pigmented and heavy enough to not need much, but it doesn't feel cakey. You can use more if you need to build it up. I've mainly used it over top of foundation and it does add an additional coverage in areas that you want it.I like that ELF products are cruelty free and vegan. This product also doesn't have any noticeable scent to it which I also like for most face products.",

My eyes are probably on the drier side, but I use moisturizer and sunscreen before my makeup. I always test things on the back of my hand and this accentuated the lines immediately on my hand. I gave it a go under my eyes and it did not go so well. I applied it sparingly because it is full coverage. I think it just dried down super quick. I wasn't able to get it blended and my lines were very apparent. I tried it one day with a brush and another day with a sponge. The sponge worked marginally better, but I would not use this in my routine. As the day went by, the oils in my face seem to tame it a little, but it was not pretty in the morning. I have a lot of luck with Haus Labs & Rare Beauty, but was looking for a less expensive alternative.",

Hydrating Camo (shade Light Ivory). My skin tone is light neutral with peachy undertones. Overall, L\u2019Oreal has the edge because it goes on the smoothest and blends out the best, saving me time. It is also the most expensive of the three, but my time is also worth money to me.L\u2019Oreal is not fully matte, light is reflected off my under eyes. The finish is quite natural though. Coverage is full, similar to the other two, my under eye hollows are very well concealed. The formula goes on very smoothly.Covergirl has full coverage and a matte finish. The formula dries quickly, and doesn\u2019t go on as smoothly as the L\u2019Oreal, sometimes cakes up a wee bit on dry spots.The E.L.F., I love the information on their website about shades and undertones; makes it easy to find your shade. The coverage is full with a matte finish similar to Covergirl, dries fairly quickly as well, and also can cake up a wee bit on dry spots. It\u2019s very similar to the Covergirl.If you\u2019re not looking for full coverage, the Maybelline Fit Me has a light formula that goes on very smoothly and has a nice finish leaning towards dewy. Under the eyes, light will reflect off of it. I got this in shade 10 Fair. It\u2019s a little on the pink side, but is still an acceptable match.",

I applied it under my eyes, around my nose, on my nose and on my chin and it doesnt crease besides a little under my eye but i just blend it out and it doesnt crease anymore after that! I would definitely recommend:)",
