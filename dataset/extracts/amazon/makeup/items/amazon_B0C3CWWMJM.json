Blending it out makes it look better but when i have the right look after a while the product starts to come off, like in little flakes. So if you put too much on without properly blending it, that might happen. Over all i love them, the packaging in super cute and it smells relatively good.",

I love putting on a lip stain and then being able to put a gloss or balm on top without it coming off. I would say it\u2019s very long lasting as well, I have tried other lip stains and this is probably one of the best ones. I think it lasts for about 4-5 hours and then it does start to fade. My only complaint is that I really only use 3 of the colors it comes with, but a little goes a long way. For this price I will be buying it again. Definitely recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "The packaging of this product is super cute and durable, the size of each lip tint was smaller than I expected but they contain a surprising amount of product.I found that all the shades were very pigmented and bright, and they apply on the lips smoothly, which is very helpful.However, after having it on your lips, for a few seconds, it starts to feel drying and didn\u2019t feel good on my lips. After wiping off excess, my lips didn\u2019t feel so dry and the color was spectacular.The shades all look beautiful and vibrant while still looking professional and put together. After a day, it is obvious that the pigment has gone away, which disappointed me, because I expected it to last longer.Overall, this product is great for traveling because it is so small, and easy to apply. But going for a permanent lip tint, this product did not work for me. The main issue for me was the short, lasting pigment, other than that this product is amazing and I will continue to use it.",

                "reviewText": "The packaging is super cute. The tubes of product are very small. I only like 3 of the colors. It does stain and last for a few hours, however when it does come off, it comes off unevenly so it looks really odd. When you apply, it stains your inner lip really well, but then you have to apply multiple times for the rest of your lips to blend properly, so it's not the easiest to use. You can put a balm or gloss over it without it coming off too much. It's good for the price, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.",
