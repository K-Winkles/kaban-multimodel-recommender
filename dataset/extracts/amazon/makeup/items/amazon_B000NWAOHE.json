Recommend using thick disposable makeup remover pads when traveling that can also be used for removing nail polish with separate remover. But if you want to be more eco friendly at home, have a couple of dedicated wash clothes and that would do the trick as well.",

                "reviewText": "Good points:GENTLE--definitely is. . I shook the bottle up because this is a biphasic solution, then wetted a cotton pad and wiped off eyeshadow, mascara and eyebrow powder. No irritation and even though I have sensitive skin and eyes, it felt great.I got a good schmear of the eye shadow on my cotton pad but....not the mascara. (Essence False Eyelash Effect.) I could see the color of my eyeshadow but no inky streak from the black mascara.Bad points:Until I washed my face well AFTER using this remover, and got rings of mascara below my eye, the two or three swipes with that cotton pad and remover did NOT touch my mascara. My mascara is not waterproof mascara, either. So truly, the first wipes of the cotton pad and Neutrogena Gentle Oil-Free remover did not touch my mascara AT ALL.I wetted another pad and it easily took off the rest of the mascara and I then washed my face to remove the remover (again). It did a good job removing the mascara residue.I'd buy this again anyway because I like that I woke up the next day without eye irritation but you have to work at removing mascara. Since the remover is so gentle, and I hate waking up with irritated eyes, I'd put up with using AFTER I wash my face to remove the residue of makeup left behind and then rinse again. If I were to find another that is as gentle but more effective, I'd switch.NOT recommended, therefore, for waterproof mascara.",
