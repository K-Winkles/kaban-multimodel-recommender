                "reviewText": "I love this brush holder/cleaner. It\u2019s a very genius, unique invention, and I\u2019m so glad I bought it. If you\u2019re make up person and you have a lot of brushes/beauty blenders, you will definitely get the best use out of this. I just keep my brushes standing up inside of it just as storage, which I don\u2019t have to do, but it\u2019s so convenient. If you use the proper slots, the brushes won\u2019t come out when you stick them inside. So that means you can turn it upside down if you need to wash one brush, while the other brushes remain stuck inside the bottom, and they won\u2019t fall out. Just a clever invention. I 100% recommend it. And I look forward to this company next invention. By the way, I don\u2019t know who manufactured this product originally but, whoever did, kudos to you!",

And to little bucket to hold the sponges is well thought out. The holding strap is also awesome. It seems delicate but its alot tougher and useful than you think. If you use the texture to wash the brushes becareful to not get water between the plastic and silicon. It doesn't come off so you can't try it well. But its still well made and thought out. Excellent product. I put a small towel down to catch any drips. And everything is firmly put it. If you do come out with a painting version for thicker handles let me know. 10 out of 10.",
