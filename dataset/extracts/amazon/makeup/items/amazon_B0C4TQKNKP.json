                "reviewText": "This makeup case is perfect for doing makeup in bed or other place thats not a vanity. Mainly because of the lights and the way you can make the mirror stand up, along with having your makeup organized in compartments. It is, however, very bulky and heavy, so I wouldn't say it's the best thing for traveling.Another negative thing about it is how you have to adjust the mirror in a way so that it gets in the way of your makeup in the compartments at the back, and depending on what angle you're sitting at, it takes some adjusting to get the angle right (it doesn't really angle down)...I find myself having to lean into the mirror to see but that could just be my bad eyesight. And sometimes the whole thing closes when I'm trying to reach for an eyeshadow at the back...in this sense it's almost less convenient than a regular makeup bag.Other than that, this thing is sturdy and solid, and its worth the minor inconveniences to not have to constantly dump my makeup out of my bag and hold up a mirror anymore. Not to mention trying to find lighting or which way the sun is shining. The compartments are handy, because in my mind I divide my makeup routine into different stages; foundation, powders, eyes and lips, so the organisation is just delightful. The little dividers lift up sometimes when you transport this thing though, so sometimes an eyeliner ends up rolling into a different compartment.I'm planning on buying this for a friend too because she does her makeup sitting on the floor where her full length mirror is, not having enough space in a small apartment shared with a roommate. Im sure other people can relate to this. It's like having a little vanity at your disposable no matter what your living conditions are.",

There are a lot of spaces for all of my cosmetics and cleansers. You can move the sections around to fit your products. In the past, I traveled with two separate pouches; one for makeup and the other for my cleansers and moisturizers. Now, everything fits in this case. The mirror is fantastic and it comes with a suction magnifier mirror which is very helpful. No more having to use horrible hotel lighting! Game changer!",
