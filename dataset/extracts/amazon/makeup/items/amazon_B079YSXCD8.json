                "reviewText": "The pencil is nice and thin, it does a great job of filling in the background of the gaps in my mature brows that have become sparse with age. Nice spoolie on one end and the thin fine retractable pencil on the other. The Glue is a great way to \"Set\" the brows once you have used the pen and spoolie to keep the look intact. Of course if you rub them too much, it will negate your initial grooming (which is expected), but I find that it has great holding power throughout the day for me. It's also a more subtle and soft look as opposed to dying your brows. I suppose that depends on what shade of pencil you get. I went for a more subtle matching shade to my natural brows.I do dye my brows from time to time, and this also works well to color in the background of the areas that just look a little thin.",

Previously I was using a powder that worked but easily rubbed off and wasn't precise. I thought I would shoot my shot and use a pencil to draw what I wanted my eyebrows to look like. I was hesitant to use a pencil because I didn't want my eyebrows to look like they had literally been drawn on. I wanted that natural look.I tried this pencil out and immediately I was a fan. You can precisely draw how you want your brows to look. The attached spoolie blends everything so it doesn't look like actual drawn-on lines. I have received so many compliments on my eyebrows! I highly recommend this brow pencil! It lasts all day, even in the heat or with my busy toddler touching my face. I have even slept overnight with it on and it looks pretty good in the morning.My only small complaint is that I wish they had more dark-colored options. My hair is a light brown so I tried the color Taupe first- way too light and warm-toned for me. So I tried Espresso, which is the darkest brown color, and it still isn't that dark, more like a medium brown color with a warm undertone. But it still looks good! Just not as dark as I would like.",

I went through dozens of ash browns, ash blonds, taupes - they all look brassy and tacky with grey hair. The couple of grey options I managed to find were in liquid form and look very dark, pretty much black, when dry.Unbelievably, this pencil in GREY actually works!Please NYX don't make it a limited time option, stick with it. I don't have it in me to spend another three years and tons of money searching for a replacement.(for some reason the review shows under Ash Brown instead of Grey, which I also purchased and it was another disappointment)",
