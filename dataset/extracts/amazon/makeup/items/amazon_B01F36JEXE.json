All makeup sponges are the normal size, which can also turn bigger and much softer when fully expand (after soaking enough water). Are the quality of these blenders the same as the expensive beauty sponges? And how long they last? These sponges are all made from high quality non-latex and non-allergenic material. The material is the same as other brands of beauty sponge, BEAKEY beauty sponge has more styles and will cover your makeup needs. How can I determine if the makeup sponge and powder puff I bought are authentic? When you receive your product, please look for the Transparency logo and code.

                "reviewText": "They are very dense, no sculpting. Pretty colors are nice when I want to use them for different things and need to remember which is which. Color coding makes that easy. Other brands are all pink or shades of pink, and I have to store the sponges in certain places to know which is for which product. It is not like you can write on them without it looking gross. I use many sponges at once to apply only one product each so there is no cross-contamination, and I clean them regularly with soap and water and replace them regularly. I would not travel with these because I put them into a drawer, and they got creases from being pressed next to the others for only a few days. Store them in the container until you are ready to use them. The softer ones have more give but absorb more makeup, which is wasteful. Look at the photo where I am squishing the sponge. It is so dense that it won't squish down all the way but still effectively and smoothly applies makeup.",

Why anyone would pay $20 for a name-brand Beauty Blender when there\u2019s excellent dupes like these is beyond my realm of comprehension. These are just as soft, bouncy, and absorbent (but not overly so, as to waste product) as the name brand. And they cost a little over $1 a piece, as compared to the AT LEAST $20 price tag on the name brand Beauty Blenders! So this is a total no-brainer! I find washing my BB\u2019s a pain in the a$$, even with alcohol, so @ this price, they\u2019re pretty much disposable. This is the 4th or 5th package of these i\u2019ve purchased, and i hope they never stop making them @ this cost. Coz i\u2019ll buy this brand til the end of time, if they let me!",

They are very dense as well - not sure if that's a cause of some of the below issues.I think some of them might be retaining moisture or something? I had one that didn't fully dry for over 3 days (even after leaving it on my car's dashboard in the sun), at which point I just threw it out because nothing should be wet for that long.Another one didn't clean as fully as the previous one, which is so strange since they are supposed to be the same product.I'm on my 3rd or 4th from the pack right now and I will go with a different brand next time around.",

Whenever I do makeup for a bride, I always give it to the bride for her personal use after.I use it for personal use as well but the only downside is, it breaks down faster than beauty blender. That is actually not an issue, because it is so affordable, I can toss it out more often therefore making it more hygienic.",
