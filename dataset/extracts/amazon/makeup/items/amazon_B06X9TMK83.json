I like that it has both the option to plug it in with a micro USB cable or 4 AAA batteries for power. The lighting is very bright, almost too bright at times. While the unit is very light, it seems well made. You do have to tighten the screw where the mirror connects to the stand, to keep it at whatever angle you want. I didn\u2019t see that as a big deal.I do wish the mirror could be adjusted to be higher or lower (even a little), but for the price point I\u2019ll live with it. I bought this mirror during Prime Days at ~$24. I see it is still selling for that much. While I like the mirror, I wouldn\u2019t pay the full price listed amount of $49.99.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect gift for a friend, daughter, sister, cousin! I got this as a last Christmas gift for a cousin of mine who is very entrepreneurial. I thought not only would this be a perfect addition to have for her skin cafe routines, but it would make a perfect \u201cring light\u201d of sorts in even creating videos or content on today\u2019s major platforms. So perfect for makeup/skincare but also perfect to use in your videos / content making! The lighting is perfect and the zoom features are next level to your typical vanity mirror. This is an upgrade!!! The design is aesthetically minimal, elegant, so cute. Perfect gift, perfect investment.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I just got it today and here are my initial thoughts.1. Sturdy2. Nice size. Not too small, not too big.3. I really think the one I received was a return. Why? Because the box was bent at the opening and the mirror was not wrapped properly. But, I did not want this to deter me from trying it. I just cleaned it with alcohol wipes, just in case.4. I think it was returned because the mirror didn\u2019t \u201cstay\u201d at whatever position I set it. It would tilt down on its own. I tightened up the screw where the mirror attaches to the base and now it stays.5. I wish it could get taller and shorter as needed. The height is fine as is for me, unless I want to use the 2x mirror. Then I need to pick it up to see. This inhibits me from hands free usage.6. Although the base locks in fine, I just wish it would fold under the mirror. It\u2019s kind of bulky to store in my make-up drawer. 7. I\u2019m not sure I like how the mirror lights up. Even though the light-brightness is adjustable, with the lights coming from each dot surrounding the mirror is REALLY bright and when I dim it then, of course, dims the reflection which can alter the make-up application. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019m used to large upper-torso mirrors with light bulbs surrounding them (for stage make-up purposes). And, I\u2019m used to smaller mirrors with light up cases as well. But, admittedly, the smaller ones usually have the light features covered which helps soften the glare but not the brightness impact. So, I guess I\u2019ll have to see.8. Love the color.All this review is prior to actual use with applying make-up but these are my initial thoughts.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful mirror that adjusts angles easily",
                "reviewText": "Okay, first the con. Yes, this is a lighted mirror. There are tiny, bright LED lights all around the edge of the main mirror (none on the side mirrors). However, I find that they add more glare than light, but in a dim room, they may be useful. However, I wouldn't rely on the lighting on the mirror for things like color accuracy if you are putting on makeup. Here are the pros. First of all, it is just large enough to see your entire face easily, and it angles perfectly when I need to use it to dry and style my hair. The magnifying mirrors are located on the right--3x on top and 2x on bottom. The bottom mirror is somewhat awkward to (okay, there is another \"con\"), but I'm blind as a bat so the larger magnification is more useful for me when I need do my eye makeup. For the size, the mirror is very light. I have a hand mirror that is half the size but actually weighs more. I ordered the mirror in rose gold, and it is a deeper color than most items that come in this shade. However, it is a beautiful color and the mirror is lovely enough to leave out on your table or counter. As for travelling---unless you have a very big purse or tote, I wouldn't really consider this something you want to carry around with you. However, the stand comes off easily, so the whole thing can be folded flat. It should fit nicely into my larger carryon--I don't think I want to put glass into a check-in bag, but you could if you wanted to pack it in a way that it is padded and protected. It did arrive in the mail in one piece, after all. I bought the mirror when the price dipped just below $20.00 and it is a very good value for around that price. For better, variable lighting, you should be expected to pay a lot more. However, I am very pleased with the mirror and it's great to be able to easily move the mirror in the needed position (not have to force it down or up with both hands) AND have it STAY that way (it doesn't move until you move it).",

This mirror\u2019s lights ONLY stay on when plugged in- it doesn\u2019t charge up for wireless use. This is disappointing. You can use batteries for wireless, but it takes 4 and I prefer something rechargeable. While you can also adjust the brightness, I would prefer a warmer light setting.",
