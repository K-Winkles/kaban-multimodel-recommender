I had been using bottled eye makeup remover by target and it was making the skin under my eyes all red. The almay did not irritate my skin or eyes at all.

However, it leaves behind a very oily residue\u2026 often I don\u2019t want to remove all my mascara, just touch up a place that\u2019s rubbed off/smudged; however, if you use this the oily residue just causes more mascara around it to smudge and you end up having to fully wash it off.I have found that if I take a square of folded toilet paper or a q-tip and rub it across the makeup remover pad I can use that to do the touch ups and it doesn\u2019t leave behind as much of the oily residue for just the touch up stuff. Kinda annoying to have to do that, but if you want something that will easily take off your hard to remove makeup this is it.Also nice that it doesn\u2019t irritate my skin (and I have very sensitive skin being a ginger).",

I noticed the skin around my eyes was looking very haggard and older than it normally does, and I couldn't figure it out. I stopped using the pads and started using baby oil on an ordinary cotton pad and my eyes looked so much better... actually in one day they recovered! Disappointed that these pads seemed like they would be very helpful but wound up making my eyes look worse. And you really have to dab for quite a while to make the waterproof makeup come off.",

I use 1 pad for each eye and it removes everything even when I'm wearing lots of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and Mascara. They do feel a bit greasy but if you properly remove your makeup and use other wipes, cleansers, or toner it's no problem! These are definetly going to last me a while and I'll be purchasing more when I run out!",

Son 120 piezas, yo trato de no maquillarme diario, por lo que me dura unos 6 meses el frasquito, lo cual para mi es un excelente costo.",
