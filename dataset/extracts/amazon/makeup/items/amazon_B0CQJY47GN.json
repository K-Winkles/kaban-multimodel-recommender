I had not cleaned my stuff in months because I was too lazy to clean them by hand. Because of this I had to run a couple of brushes twice but no big deal. I used my hand soap to clean them and they came out nice and fluffy. Dried over night. If washing by hand they would take days to dry because they were not fully clean. When cleaning the brushes with this washer the brushes were dried over night. When washing the sponges I would recommend filling the water below the max fill line. If you are using hand soap to wash them then one or two pumps is more than enough soap. Do not let the price fool you. There are others just like this for $20 to $30 but I did not have a problem. Also, the only complaint I have is that the power cord is a USB-A so make sure you have a charging block with this end.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I am glad that I chose this one over some others based on price, because if I had paid the double price they were asking for essentially the same thing, I would be upset.As for the automated option, the section that \"holds\" the brushes will only hold thinner stemmed brushes, so I literally could only wash my eyeshadow brushes automatically. All of my other brushes have handles that are too thick. This just means that I have to hold them in the machine myself while it is running. not the worst, but not the \"set it and forget it\" that I was looking forward to--It's still better than hardly ever washing them at all, so I will take it-- plus, I only paid 9.99.That said, that also means I cannot use it to store or dry most of my brushes--so it is pretty much a uni-tasker (it agitates water so that I can clean my brushes more quickly with solution and water. period.)Also, no mention in the instructions for what I am supposed to do with the extra silicone pad with grooves. I assume from pictures of other products that I can rub my brush against it to help loosen product",
