They work amazingly well for whitehead as long as they are not internal. You can really see all the white that has been sucked out of your skin and it it hasn\u2019t sucked everything out it freeze it up to the surface so if you give it a light squeeze, everything comes out afterwards. it\u2019s also great because when it\u2019s on it keeps you from picking up the pimple which has always been my biggest issue. It lets your pimple heal quicker and less irritation on the skin. Say goodbye to scars.I buy these religiously from my son was 13 and it works miracles.I do have to say that it is important that you apply to very clean skin, no lotion or retinol, or it won\u2019t stick",
