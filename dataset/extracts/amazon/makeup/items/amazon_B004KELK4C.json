                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really unique moisturizer",
                "reviewText": "LOVE this! (For context, I'm 61 with really good but very sensitive skin.) With ingredients like Soy Proteins, Aloe Vera, Beeswax, and Shea Butter, I worried that this might feel too waxy or thick. It's not. It's a unique moist-creamy texture that spreads out thinner than expected. It's nothing like the German Nivea I've been using (and loving) but almost like a cross between a lotion and a cream. It's different from any moisturizer that I've ever used. (I included a lot of photos for folks like me who are picky about product details.)When I applied just a little of this to my hand to test the texture, it immediately made the skin feel super-hydrated. About half a minute after I applied it to my face, I did feel a very slight tingle that wasn't irritating and didn't last longer than about 5 minutes. My skin felt hydrated and more supple than before I applied the cream. (I have one elbow that is very rough because I always lean on it when writing! One way that I test how moisturizing a face product is, I apply it to the elbow. By that test, this cream rocks! LOL)I haven't been wearing makeup since the lockdown started but I can tell that this would not affect a foundation at all. It just soaks into the skin and does its job. It's like it disappears but leaves my skin feeling really, really good.By the way, it really does only take a VERY tiny bit to treat the face and neck. I literally just touch the top of the tube and pat the cream around before smoothing it in. It blends into the skin quickly because of the unusual texture. You can see from the photo - no makeup, just lip gloss - that there is zero shine/oiliness to my skin. For most products, I have to let them \"soak in\" for a while. This one just works right away, no waiting for the shine to dissipate.I didn't realize until I got this that it's multi-use: moisturizer, makeup base, mask, makeup remover, milk, and body lotion. Since this is a primary moisturizer for me, I didn't really notice much difference in using more than 2 applications on my face on these very dry winter days. In the summer, one application will probably be fine. I also like using it on my wrists as a perfume primer.This is probably the 4th or 5th moisturizer that I have raved about in as many months but I think I've found my perfect fit. I was using Moistfull (until the formula changed), German Nivea (still do as a night cream), Age Perfect (my skin's outgrown it), and a Hyaluronic face & body lotion that I loved until it started drying/irritating my skin after 5 or 6 uses, and a homemade goat milk-glycerin lotion (still use for less dry weather). This is the first one that I have zero complaints about - including the price.About...- The packaging - There is an expiration date on both tube and container (small embossed on the tube & underside of the box by the UPC). The tube dispenser is metal-sealed. You use the cap to puncture the seal. The cream doesn't ooze out if you are careful. It's possible to just touch the tip of the tube to get enough cream without having to squeeze hard. The box and tube both have detailed labeling on the ingredients.- The amount - This is not a really large (or small) tube and I wondered how often I should re-order. After using it for the first few days, I am going to start with an every-3-month subscription - yes, I am already subscribing.",

                "reviewText": "I Googled 'What moisturizer does Kim Kardashian use' and this popped up. It's on the internet so it must be true, right? Feeling unmoved and noncommittal to what was already on my vanity, and given the reasonable (to me) price point, I gave it a shot. I am just turned 50. Historically no major skin issues. It has been feeling dry for the last year or so. I used it once and I fell hard for this cream. I tried both this and the Embryoderme (with the brownish-red lettering). I didn't care for that one. It was fine, but the Lait-Creme Concentre has a softer, richer feel. But still light. It's quickly absorbed, leaving my skin smooth and ready for whatever follows (usually a little bronzer/powder/blush). Zero tacky or greasy residue. I live in south FL where humidity and perspiration are the norm. When I heat up, lots of other lotions I've tried kind of float back to the surface leaving an oil slick in my sweat. Not this one -- it seems to just sink in and deeply nourish. Its non-invasive, faintly sweet scent is slightly nostalgic somehow. Comforting but not at all overpowering. I haven't yet used it as a 'make-up remover milk,' like it says on the tube. But speaking of the packaging, I LOVE the aluminum tube -- it crimps together as you go so you can effortlessly get every last bit of the liquid gold out. I'm likely a lifer for this cream.",

Not overpowering.. this cream i would say really does brighten and even my complexion, it softens the skin as well. I\u2019ve noticed less breakouts with this, I use it in the morning and at night. I would def like to try the night time wrinkle cream they have as well. I\u2019m thirty, but hello preventative is key here \ud83d\udc85 the brand being French does make me feel alil fancy, this would actually be my first French skincare product. I usually go for Korean skincare (which is still amazing btw). All in all I really like this product ! Would totally recommend",

I especially like the squeeze tube, which feels more hygienic than a jar that I would have to dunk my my finger into. It does moisturize my skin, but I still have dry, flaky patches in the winter due to the cold, dry air. I will probably use this in the warmer months and find something thicker in the meantime.",
