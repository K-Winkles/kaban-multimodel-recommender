                "reviewText": "I've been using these wipes for more than 20 years and it is still my go to and brand of makeup remover wipes I reach for despite having tried every wipe and makeup remover under the sun. Cleans skin well, takes off eyemakeup without having to scrub your eyes raw, I have regular skin not necessarily sensitive but not overly tough skin and I have never experienced a rash, redness, or adverse reaction in the 20 years I've been using them. Love the full size packs for home and the travel size for on the go. Both of my Daughters 12 & 22 use them and neither have ever had a reaction. Convenient, reliable staple!",
