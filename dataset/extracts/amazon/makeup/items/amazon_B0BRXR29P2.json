Some may say this price is too expensive, but for the fact that you're getting six and they last very long (if you're only using it for pressed/loose powder), it is very worth the price. Maybe not worth it if you're a makeup artist and constantly going through this...then you need to buy bulk. But for personal use, it's great! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
