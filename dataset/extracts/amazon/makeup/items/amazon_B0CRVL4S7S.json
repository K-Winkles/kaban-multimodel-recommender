Since it\u2019s a darker warm color, I found that if I do a couple of lighter layers I can wear it during the day without it looking out of place or too much. The consistency makes it easy to apply and the pointed tip is good for more precise lines. I love that it comes with a built-in sharpener at the bottom of the pen. It\u2019s always a pain to use eye shadow sticks and not have the right kind of sharpener when you need it. Glad I picked this up.",

                "reviewText": "The Thrive Eyeshadow Stick provides a subtle shimmer from microglitter, which I think is perfect for casual, everyday wear. It almost looks like no makeup, but then it catches the light and gives off a little sparkle that brightens the eyes. I chose the mauve taupe color for under my bottom lashes, and it looks nice there. I don\u2019t like it as much in the inner corners; the champagne color would look prettier in that area. The stick is not very creamy, but it does apply easily and precisely. There is zero fallout. I like that there is a built-in sharpener, which is convenient and does not fall off.",

I have tried several of these kind of highlighters now, and they do not work well, so I was optimistic about this one.I am afraid that this one was a huge failure as well.As you can see from the photos I posted, you can\u2019t even hardly tell that it\u2019s on my face. I put this around the entire inner corner of my eye, and a little ways onto my lower lash line and from my pics you can kind of see remnants of it, but really, there was no point in putting this on at all because it was very difficult to apply, and just wouldn\u2019t stick to my skin, and when I finally got some on it wore off within half an hour.So I\u2019m really disappointed with this and it\u2019s just a waste of money.I absolutely can\u2019t recommend this.This should really be glowing around the entire inner corner of my eye, and under my eyelash and it\u2019s like I put nothing on at all.I do hope this review is helpful and you have a wonderful day!",

For my skin, specifically, I\u2019d prefer a shade lighter but that doesn\u2019t take away from the quality of this color. It has just the right amount of shine, sheer, and brilliance. I\u2019ve gotten compliments (I use it in the inside corners of my eyes) and it\u2019s become part of my makeup routine. A+",

I like the stick application as I tend to do better with placement than with powder, for some reason.I wouldn\u2019t say it lasts any more or less than any other product of its kind, not spectacular, but I will add it to my rotation when I want to add a little touch of shimmer.",

After applying, one needs to use a eyeshadow sponge-stick to feather it out, so we are not really sure why use this in the first place.It is creamy, but since it is in a stick, it goes on heavy to a spot and not light like eyeshadow should be applied.So much easier just to use regular eyeshadow, as this actually makes more work, not less.",
