Liquid liner gave me better results using this gadget, but not foolproof. I will have to go back to using tape, which always works great for me",

I have bought specific brushes, used tape, watched tons of tutorials but always ended up with a terrible wing. That\u2019s until I used this!!!! This made it so simple. I used a very stiff, angled brush and eyeshadow and my wings are beautiful. I have not attempted with liquid liner because that\u2019s too harsh for me at my age. If you need help with a wing, buy this, you won\u2019t regret it!!!",
