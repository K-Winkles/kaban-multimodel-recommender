                "reviewText": "This is probably the creamiest, easiest to apply foundation I have tried so far. I don't use a brush, just my fingertips, and some foundations are thick, hard to apply, or make your pores and fine lines more visible. Not this one! All I do is apply it to clean, moisturized skin (I like to use a moisturizer with sunblock built in), and it blends right in! It smoothes and evens out uneven skin tone and makes the skin glowy, which I like. You can't tell AT ALL that you are wearing any foundation! You can't see it or feel it. It's pretty cool. And the price is amazing.However, it's not perfect. It doesn't cover everything. After I use it, I can still see the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, the minor redness on my forehead or the occasional tiny zit or two... Not the way my other foundation from Il Makiage does. I even tried applying as much as 4 layers of the stuff, in the hope that coverage would build -didn't work.So... I really do like it, but I don't conpletely love it. I think I might need something with a fuller coverage. Therefore today I decided to use this foundation all over my face, and THEN dot it in the most problematic areas (those with redness and hyperpigmentation) with my trusted Il Makiage foundation -and it looked REALLY good! Sometimes, the Il Makiage foundation settles in my fine lines and emphasizes them instead of hide them (I know they also came up with a blurring product, but I haven't tried it yet -it's kind of pricey)... So using both products might be the trick I need -at least for now.",

                "reviewText": "I'm really glad I ran across this Elf Flawless Satin Foundation. The depiction is great, and I found the perfect match to my skin tone on the first attempt. Just purchased my second bottle. It's very lightweight and goes on really smoothly over lotion, primer, & concealer using a wedge makeup sponge. It soaks in quickly and doesn't smudge nor smear. I follow with Wet 'n Wild Photofocus Translucent Setting Powder and a setting spray. None of that disturbs the Elf foundation. It stays on, doesn't smudge, feels very lightweight, lasts all day. Easily removed with baby wipe, followed by Clinique 'Take the Day Off Makeup Remover' then Clinique 'Clarifying Lotion 2 Twice a Day Exfoliator' then Clinique 'Moisture Surge Overnight Mask' lotion. When looking for a different foundation, I spent a LOT of time Googling \"best of\" (not Sponsored, lol) lightweight, waterproof, etc. I had been using Cover Girl Outlast Extreme Wear, but the last bottle was a different consistency and shade even though I'd reordered the same product, so I was on the prowl for a well-like product that had the qualities I wanted. I'm in my 2nd bottle and don't plan on changing to a different brand in the foreseeable future unless the formulation changes. Easy to color-match to your skin tone, applies quickly, smoothly, evenly, with very little product to obtain full coverage. Lasts all day. Good value for the money...doesn't break the bank.",

It says medium on the bottle, it barely covered my minimal dark spots. Somehow, even though it didn\u2019t cover those, it managed to settle in the fine lines under my eyes.Now that\u2019s it\u2019s dried, it\u2019s sort of dewy I guess. My face feels somewhat sticky.Despite all this, I love the color. It seemed like it was going to be very yellow, but it looks pretty good.

                "reviewText": "Being initially skeptical due to its budget-friendly price tag, I took the plunge and tried the e.l.f. Foundation after reading positive online reviews. Here's my breakdown of the experience:Coverage and Lightness:The foundation's coverage is remarkable, effectively concealing imperfections and leaving a flawless look. What truly sets it apart is its lightweight formula \u2013 it doesn't feel heavy on the skin, allowing for a natural and breathable finish. It's a great choice for those who prefer a more natural makeup look.Shade Selection Challenges:While the foundation itself exceeded expectations, the online shade selection process proved a bit challenging. The colors displayed on the website didn't precisely match the actual shades, making it difficult to determine the right match. I recommend purchasing a shade lighter than your usual choice to avoid potential discrepancies.In conclusion, the e.l.f. Foundation is a fantastic find for those seeking quality at an affordable price. The coverage and lightweight feel make it a standout product in the drugstore makeup arena. However, the challenge of accurately selecting the right shade online is a drawback. Overall, an excellent foundation that proves you don't need to break the bank for a flawless finish.",

It has no scent (I prefer a little scent in my products tbh), goes on smoothly..blends nicely and dries to a nice soft finish. Will definitely buy again. Elf always impresses me with their value/quality for money!",
