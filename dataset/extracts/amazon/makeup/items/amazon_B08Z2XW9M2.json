Use a thick brush in a rounded motion. This should leave you with a visible circle of eyeshadow, but in a subtle shade. 5. Draw eyeshadow slightly darker than your skin tone along your crease. Using a thick brush upward almost to your brow bone, thinning it into a smoky effect. 6. Brighten your eyes with a small addition.

                "reviewText": "I was completely shocked at the quality of this palette compared to the price. Usually when you get a lot of colors for a small price you get poor quality but that is not the case here. These shadows are very pigmented! They also blend very nicely. They have very good staying power as well. The brushes aren\u2019t bad either, very soft and pick up product well.The first two pictures are the color swatched over concealer, the third is some swatches over a black primer, the third is and example of how well they blend (I\u2019m not great at make up but you get the idea!), fourth is of a quick look I did and the fifth is the palette in regular house lighting.",

The shadows feel very soft, and I\u2019m looking forward to trying them later for date night. It comes with this set of brushes, which is a nice touch, tho they\u2019ll be my travel brushes. I took the pic with an ink pen across just to give an idea of the size of the shadow pots. They\u2019re not big, and I feel like I\u2019ll probably run out of the favorite ones quickly.I\u2019ll amend my review after I give it a try!UPDATE: Okay- So I've used it a lot since my initial review. As far as staying power, I'd probably only give it 2 stars. Even with primer my shadow was near non-existent after about 5 hours of wear. Pigmentation- 2 stars. The colors I thought would be dramatic really weren't, and I felt like I had to really build it up. Those colors I did use were very blendable, however. Over all, it's an okay interim palette until I have time and money to get the better brand.",
