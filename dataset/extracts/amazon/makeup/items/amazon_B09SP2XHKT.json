                "reviewText": "Not at all sticky or gooey! I like the way that this glides on my lips. I live in Northern Arizona so my lips always seemed to dry and feel chafed a lot. And at age 70+ I need a little bit of color. I carry this with me and I'm planning on getting some of the other colors.I normally use a light berry color or a soft Maude lip stick but they don\u2019t last long and they are too drying. I can wear this lip gloss alone or add on top of my lip color. I love how the Madeleine color is so pretty by itself, with a soft hint/just the right amount of color or that it adds a nice tinge of gloss on top of my normal lipstick.And then there is the price! Very very affordable for someone like me on a fixed income!",

If I put on a lot it does feel a little sticky, but I get plenty of color with less product so I\u2019ve switched to applying less. Will buy more of these.

Yes, they are sticky and you have to reapply often, just like every other lip gloss I've ever used, but they feel nourishing on the lips and look good, so I am happy with them.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss in the Angel Food Cake shade, and it\u2019s quickly become one of my favorites. The true mauve color is beautiful and versatile, suitable for a range of skin tones and occasions.The texture is what stands out the most. Unlike many lip glosses that can feel sticky or heavy, this butter gloss lives up to its name with a smooth, buttery application. It feels comfortable on the lips, and I can wear it for hours without any discomfort.The gloss provides a lovely shine without being overly glossy, striking the perfect balance for those who want a noticeable yet understated look.It\u2019s easy to apply, with a wand that allows for precise and even application. The size of the gloss is also convenient for carrying in a purse or a makeup bag.The gloss is fairly long-lasting for a non-sticky formula, though it does require reapplication after eating or drinking.The reason for giving it four stars is the need for frequent reapplication to maintain the color intensity.Overall, the NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss in Angel Food Cake is a fantastic product for anyone looking for a non-sticky, comfortable, and beautifully colored lip gloss. It\u2019s a great addition to any makeup collection for everyday wear or special occasions.",
