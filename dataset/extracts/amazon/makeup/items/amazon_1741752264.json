                "reviewText": "If you're like me, you will read negative reviews so I'd like to address a few that I read (because I honestly didnt expect to see any for this book). 1) this book, if a \"Pro\" purchased it, is NOT a pro book. It's covering extreme basics and as a \"PRO\" you should know those before calling yourself one. So rating a book on your inability to distinguish what the book is, that's on you.2) \"heavy application\" yeah, a makeup book that shows you how to apply makeup is going to be a bit more detailed than the \"natural look\" which IS covered in here. I personally use the \"bronzed look\" every day nearly. I like a more natural look for day.3) the book covers not just technique but gets into detail about what brush to use where which is key to achieving looks.4) most of the looks are for evening wear. They're dark and playful BUT if you have an kind of creativity, you can create lighter versions of the looks. It's not a Holy Bible, it's suggestions. PLAY!5) the \"pro\" who wouldn't put tape on to create an edge or wouldn't allow her clients to sleep in makeup to make a smudged look... Ummmmm really? I want your name so I can avoid you at all costs since you're clearly more opinionated than sensible. The book NEVER said to have a client sleep in makeup. It was addressing the \"day after\" a night out and how to make yourself presentable. If you were very smart, you'd have realized this book is for me, the average woman. Not a \"pro\" who really isn't a pro. And tape isn't unsanitary. It's tape. Your makeup brushes are far more unsanitary than tape no matter how much you clean them. But you're right, you're the \"pro\" and you know way more than Rae Morris who gets paid top dollar to do makeup rather than read about it.So, if you're looking for a great book that tells you about makeup technics in detail and want some easy to follow options for looks and how to achieve them, this is it. I gave the \"eyes\" version to my daughter. She loves it.",

                "reviewText": "If you buy this book be prepared to possibly discover how little you knew about makeup application and that you have been doing everything wrong for decades like I did. I read this book from cover to cover and it is an awesome book. The author somehow manages to pack extremely valuable information in relatively short passages. The written material is succinctly written and I found very little if any extraneous information. I wouldn't say it's something similar to \"Make-up for Dummies\" if it exists but the instructions are very easy to follow. The book is separated into chapters by the order of make-up application such as \"Skin Prepping\", \"Eyes\", \"Foundation\", etc. The \"Eyes\" chapter is amazing with so many different make-up looks and as I said, the instructions are relatively easy to follow. If you're concerned about time constraints, don't be. I'm a fairly low-maintenance woman and I spent very little time applying makeup when I did apply it. I count on spending anywhere from an extra 5-10 minutes a day depending on the look I'm choosing which isn't very significant when I consider the vast improvement in my look. The author does make frequent suggestions on how to avoid spending an exorbitant amount of money on make-up and/or supplies which is very useful particularly for budget-minded individuals such as myself. I could really go on and on about how great this book is. I actually feel more confident going out now (yes, pathetic but true). It was money very well spent and I can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "This book is more inspiration than instruction. Yes, there are step by step instructions and sections on specialty issues, ie, oriental eyes, some makeovers of older women, but essentially the book assumes a certain level of proficiency. That being said, her contouring and highlighting photographs are well worth the price of the book. (Remember to blend.) There are some color charts and tips and at least this author isn't afraid to recommend false eyelashes.The photographs are largely editorial with an emphasis on eyes. Again like couture, it is not for everyday wear but provides a creative impulse to integrate. I liked that she included the older ladies (also lovely model specimens) with assist to their issues. (I also thought it was a major cautionary tale about sun damage.) I would have like to see greater diversity especially regarding age and profession (non-models please). Yes, those fifteen year olds have pefect skin and are totally unblemished by either time or experience. No challenge there. But find the beauty in the imperfection and make it work.Again a fun book to look at with some valuable tips and charts.",

                "reviewText": "I have been reading/buying beauty books by various make up artists for the past 25 years, and this is one that stands apart from the rest. What impressed me a lot was Rae's knowledge on brushes, makeup-up products, and techniques, information that I never found in the other makeup books. In fact, in reading the other makeup books, I got the impression that makeup artists only give you the obvious, basic techniques because they dont want to spill their secrets, but rest assured that with Rae, that doesn't happen! She freely shares her knowledge in this book, and demonstrates it, which is something that I, who can't afford a world renown artist to work on my face, really appreciates!",

                "reviewText": "Avant toute chose, c'est un livre en anglais, comme beaucoup dans le makeup. C'est un livre complet mais qui je pense n'est pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 des personnes totalement d\u00e9butantes dans ce domaine l\u00e0.Il vous apprendra certaines base, comme les diff\u00e9rents types de pinceaux, les diff\u00e9rents types de produits, comment pr\u00e9parer une peau avant de la maquiller etc.... Il propose un bon nombre de maquillages \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser (en 10 mins, pour les peaux matures, pour les yeux asiatiques etc) avec des \u00e9tapes plus ou moins d\u00e9taill\u00e9es en image, mais qui a mon sens suffises.Par ailleurs, pour contraster avec certains commentaires, les maquillages pr\u00e9sents dans ce livre ont majoritairement pour but d'\u00eatre artistiques. L'auteur est reconnue d'ailleurs pour cela.Pour les commentaires qui parlent de \"photos qui ne correspondent pas au tuto pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s\", il faut savoir que il n'y a pas seulement un travail de maquillage dans ce livre mais \u00e9galement un travail de photographie y est mis en avant. L'angle de la photographie, la lumi\u00e8re utilis\u00e9e, la pose du mannequin sont primordiales et parfois oubli\u00e9 par certains.On est clairement sur un livre qui tend \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper le c\u00f4t\u00e9 artistique du maquillage et non un livre qui va vous apprendre \u00e0 faire un trait de liner adapter \u00e0 votre type d'oeil, bien qu'il y ait beaucoup de conseils \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur.Je le conseille vraiment pour toutes celles et ceux qui souhaitent d\u00e9velopper ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u00e0 !NB: remettons dans le contexte que ce livre a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 en 2008, les conseils sont toujours valables aujourd'hui, les styles utilis\u00e9s peut-\u00eatre moins, mais les techniques employ\u00e9s, les couleurs mises en avant sont elles, ind\u00e9modables!",

                "reviewText": "Zun\u00e4chst bekam ich ein Exemplar zugeschickt, bei welchem die goldene \"MakeUp\"-Schrift zerkratzt war. Somit als Geschenk ungeeignet. Nach dem Umtausch erhielt ich ein einwandfreies Exemplar, das sehr gut ankam (meine Schwester lernt Kosmetikerin). Es gibt hilfreiche Tips und sieht zudem gut aus im Regal. F\u00fcr jemanden der sich seit Jahren selbst schminkt und schon viel probiert steht nat\u00fcrlich nicht allzuviel neues in dem Buch. Vor allem da man mittlerweile alles auf Youtube mittels Video vermittelt bekommen kann. Aber ein Youtube-Video kann man eben schlecht verschenken oder sich ins Regal stellen.Als Geschenk f\u00fcr junge M\u00e4dchen, welche gerade anfangen sich zu schminken, empfehle ich aber das Buch Bobbi Brown - Makeup Manual.",
