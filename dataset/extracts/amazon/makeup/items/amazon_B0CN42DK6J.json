I almost didn't buy it since others have said it tastes and smells bad, but I am sensitive to that and I found it not to be true at all. It is pleasant. It comes in a pack of six, but I can't figure out if that means six different tints, or just six different [a bit gimmicky] flowers.",

It did create a nice rose color to my lips, but that effect didn't last long enough for me to purchase this item again. Plus, it came with so many extras. The packaging was really cute, very Barbie meets Bridgerton. And since they are individually wrapped and would work for any skin tones, they would make great gifts.",

Some of the reviews say they are not the best but they add a touch of shine and color to the lips that are natural and so pretty... These are worth the price you pay. They do break easily but if you don't roll the tube up more then u need they work oy fine. If you are looking for a nice natural summer lip shine this is the way to go... Even after the shine of the gloss wears off your lips remain a pretty light pinky color. I love them and will buy more but the 6 tubes I got will last a long time... Hope they don't stop selling them..oh and the flower in them makes them that much more pretty.",

The smell wasn\u2019t the prettiest (remember those wax lipsticks when you were a kid? imagine that with a little smell of hay added to it) my daughter put some on and you couldn\u2019t see any colour\u2026fast forward 30 minutes and her lips swelled up like she was stung by a bee. We wiped the gloss off and within the hour, her lips chapped and hurt so bad.I think these are more display than for usage- at least that\u2019s our take- but we ended up throwing them out none the less.",
