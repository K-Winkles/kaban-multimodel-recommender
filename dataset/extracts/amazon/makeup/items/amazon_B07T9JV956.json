It removes makeup very well and, above all, the price is very reasonable compared to any other product. As you know, it is not good to rub the area around your eyes and lips too much, but even a little bit will easily remove your makeup. Also, as you see in the photo, this bottle is larger capacity And it has almost no smell and washes off very gently. I highly recommend it.",
