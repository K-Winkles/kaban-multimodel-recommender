                "reviewText": "Cons: 1. came broken because I also ordered a glade room deodorizer and it probably rolled around in the box and got beaten up. 2. Doesn\u2019t blend well with a brush. I might use a sigma or beauty junkies brush next time.Pros: 1. Very pigmented if you go in a few times. Color payoff is nice, I used a docolor brush (did not want to use my sigma brushes because I save those for high end eyeshadows) to apply the matte shade to my lids (I have extremely hooded eyes) and then I tried a clean luxie brush to blend it. I used my finger to apply the lightest shimmer.2. The shimmers are gorgeous.3. It\u2019s small and won\u2019t take up much space. I took a photo of it near a couple of my organizers so you could see how big it is.4. The price. I will definitely order more.Tip: if you order these make sure you don\u2019t order something else that would be put in the same box. Mine got beat up by the Glade. They are sending me a new one for free and I don\u2019t have to return it.Bottom line: this is a great palette and could easily cost at least 9 or 10$ and still be a steal. Buy them now while it\u2019s still this cheap because they might go up! These are even cheaper than the bite size palettes they sell on the ELF app for 4$.Please click on helpful if you enjoyed my review and I included some photos. I used the too faced eyeshadow primer on the left eye, none on the right. I didn\u2019t see any difference. Both eyes lasted the same amount of time throughout the day.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve bought the entire series of the Wet n Wild Color Icon - and the colors are great. Buildable, blendable, and depending on the color - little fall out.Some of the colors last all day and others are completely gone after 12 hours (but the \u201ceffect\u201d is still there)Oranges and pinks/reds do not look well on me which affects my review.Most of the colors had a lovely creamy formula - but others were pretty crumbly.Walking on Eggshells is my absolute favorite that I wear everyday.Cami-Flaunt I like to wear on special occasions because that GLITTER is BAMPetallete is nice - still pretty pink for me but the rich eggplant color is marvelous.Sundaze is ORANGE and RED- but that gold is gorgeousGo Commando had more red undertones than bronze - but again great gold colorsBut My Lucky Charm is probably the most disappointing for me.On all the other palettes- I can use all 5 colors to create a single \u201clook\u201d. I\u2019m not able to do that myself with Lucky Charm palette.(pic available)The color in the pan vs when I swatch it is very different.The middle pan is a blue/teal color (gorgeous) - but it doesn\u2019t go on that way. My formula may be messed up because the teal is crumbly.The gold (2nd from right) is GORGEOUS. High shine and creamy - I\u2019ve sometimes just worn this with a darker color in the crease.",
