                "reviewText": "I am a Makeup Pro based in Hawaii and I can't rave enough about the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Towelettes\u2014they have easily become my favorite go-to choice for makeup removal. While they excel at removing face makeup and eyeshadow, I do have an extra step for tackling stubborn waterproof mascara. Nonetheless, these towelettes are still my top choice!Let's start with the positives. The price and quantity of these towelettes make them a great value for money. With 25 towelettes in a pack, they last for a decent amount of time, especially considering the affordable price point. I love that they are plant-based, aligning with my commitment to eco-friendly products.The packaging is incredibly convenient and user-friendly. The resealable pack keeps the towelettes moist and ready for use whenever I need them. They are compact and fit perfectly into any makeup bag, making them ideal for travel or on-the-go touch-ups.When it comes to removing face makeup and eyeshadow, these towelettes are superb. They are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin, making the process effortless and irritation-free. I'm always left with a clean and refreshed feeling after using them.Now, let's talk about waterproof mascara. While these towelettes may struggle with stubborn waterproof mascara, I have found a solution that works for me. Instead of relying solely on the towelettes, I use an oil-based liquid remover specifically designed to tackle waterproof mascara. By incorporating this extra step, I can effectively remove even the most resistant mascara. It does require a bit more effort, but it's worth it.Despite the extra step, the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Towelettes remain my absolute favorite choice for makeup removal. Their ultra-soft texture, non-irritating formula, and fragrance-free nature make them a fantastic option, especially for individuals with sensitive skin. They are versatile and excel at removing face makeup and eyeshadow, making them a staple in my beauty routine.In conclusion, the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Towelettes are my top choice when it comes to makeup removal. While they may require an extra step for waterproof mascara, they still outshine other options in terms of their overall performance and convenience. Their value for money, gentle nature, and compact packaging make them a must-have in any makeup bag. Don't hesitate to give them a try\u2014they won't disappoint!",
