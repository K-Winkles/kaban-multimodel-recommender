There were also a few shades that were too close in color. Another thing to keep in mind would be that some shades (specifically the mattes) will stain your skin a little.",

You can take this on trips or vacations. It comes with a variety of brushes so you can choose which one you prefer . The images that are shown are exactly what you get. I think it is a good value.",

I swatched some of the colors like the glitters, highlighter,brown contour,and a few of the dark colors bc usually in cheaper palettes those aren't very pigmented. The glitters was glistening and how do I say . They were very vibrant. The highlighter was very bright and shiny as well. The dark countour and colors were very pigmented. The brushes came all wrapped separately. This kit is amazing. Would definitely recommend. There is a wide variety of colors for whatever the vibe may be. I am in love and shook.",
