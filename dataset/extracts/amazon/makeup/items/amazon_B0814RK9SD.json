It\u2019s gentle on the under eye skin that you want to protect at all costs. Sometimes I have to use it to clean up the eye shadow that falls from my brush when you are applying it. In my younger years I would use Vaseline and you\u2019d see some shininess left behind after it was wiped off. Neutrogena wipes away clean, no traces left. One swipe and it\u2019s gone!",
