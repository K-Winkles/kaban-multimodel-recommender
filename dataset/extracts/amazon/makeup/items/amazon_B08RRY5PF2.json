                "reviewText": "I am beyond thrilled to have finally found this lip gloss after searching for it tirelessly. I used to purchase this product years ago in stores, but it seemingly disappeared from the shelves. However, thanks to my decision to check on Amazon, I stumbled upon it again, and it has quickly reclaimed its position as my favorite lip plumping gloss.One of the standout features of this gloss is its ultra-hydrating formula. It effortlessly glides onto my lips, providing a boost of moisture that leaves them feeling soft, supple, and nourished. Unlike other glosses that can leave my lips feeling dry and chapped, this product helps my lips appear smoother and more luscious.I especially appreciate the lip plumping effect that this gloss offers. While the tingling sensation may be off-putting for some, I personally find it invigorating and worth the slight tingle. The plumping effect isn't overwhelming or uncomfortable; instead, it provides a subtle enhancement to my lips, making them appear fuller and more defined.Another aspect that makes this lip gloss even more appealing is its vegan formulation. As someone who values ethical and cruelty-free products, I am delighted to know that this gloss aligns with my values. Its vegan ingredients offer peace of mind, allowing me to enjoy the product without compromising my principles.In terms of performance, this gloss ticks all the boxes. It delivers on its promises of hydration, smoothness, and plumping, leaving my lips looking and feeling fabulous. It also boasts impressive staying power, maintaining its shine and color throughout the day, reducing the need for constant reapplication.In conclusion, this Ultra-Hydrating Hybrid Gloss Plumper has made a triumphant return into my beauty routine, and I couldn't be happier. Its ability to provide both hydration and plumping effects sets it apart from other lip glosses I've tried in the past. The tingling sensation is surprisingly enjoyable, and its vegan formulation aligns with my values. If you're seeking a lip gloss that nourishes, enhances, and leaves your lips looking luscious, this is the perfect product for you. Don't hesitate to give it a try and experience its magic for yourself.",

It has a really nice smell and I love the wand for applying. I notice a little tingle afterwards and my lips are a bit plumper. I love the glitter glow and it\u2019s subtle, not overpowering. It also gives your lips a little color which I like. Definitely worth the price and worth trying. Thank you Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "I don't see a massive plumping effect but it is there, enough so that this is my new favorite lip PRODUCT overall. It seems to soak into my lips overtime and actually hydrate them, rather than sit on top and have no benefit besides looks. This means you obviously have to reapply it but you do with any gloss. It has a pleasant smell, I would say just a cosmetics smell. Leaves no gross taste in your mouth. I would say that to me, it almost feels more cooling than tinglingly. So if you're looking for a plumper that burns, this isn't it. But I recently had an allergic reaction to the too face lip injection plumper, I think it's called, so I found this and prefer it so much more. The too faced product left a dark red line of inflammation/irritation around the outside of my lips even after removing the product. I almost gave up on plumpers all together because of that but I'm so glad I decided to try this. I want other colors now. 10/10 would recommend as a gloss hybrid balm that's very comfortable & flattering. 5/10 recommend if you're looking for significant plumping.",

A little too sticky for me, but shouldn't stick to hair like other glosses. Cute packaging. Decent size. Lasts for about 2 hours before needing to apply for shine. Plump lasts about 2hrs and 30min. Made my lips have a slight light pink tone but could be bc of lighting and my skin tone. Really good for the price. If you don't mind it being sticky then I 100% recommend.",

The formula really smooths the look of my more mature 50+ lips which looks very youthful. I slightly over line my lips with the glass which creates a noticeable look of plumper and smoother lips. The tingle is very slight and pleasant. The gloss has a nice cooling and minty taste. All of the colours are stunning. Best drug store gloss I've ever purchased. I will continue to buy in the future.",
