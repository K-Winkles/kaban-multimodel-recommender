                "reviewText": "It has a Hollywood-inspired feel with the 12 dimmable LED bulbs surrounding the mirror. The bulbs provide the perfect amount of lighting and can be adjusted to your desired brightness level. I love that I can dim the lights when I want a more natural look or turn them up when I need to see more clearly.Another great feature of this mirror is the 3 color lighting modes. It has a cool white light, warm white light, and a natural light option. This is great because it allows me to see how my makeup will look in different lighting settings, whether it be outdoor, indoor, or a night out. I also love that I can easily switch between the lighting modes with just a touch of a button.The touch control design is another aspect that I really appreciate. It is so easy to use and navigate through the different settings. I can easily adjust the brightness level, switch between the lighting modes, and power the mirror on and off with just a touch. The touch buttons are also conveniently placed on the bottom of the mirror, so they're not in the way while I'm doing my makeup.The 360\u00b0 rotation feature is also a big plus for me. It allows me to easily adjust the mirror to any angle that I need. Whether I'm sitting or standing, I can always position the mirror to get the perfect view of my face. This is especially helpful when doing tasks like applying eyeliner or mascara, where precision is key.Lastly, I love that this mirror can be used either tabletop or wall-mounted. The base of the mirror is sturdy and secure, so I have no worries about it tipping over. However, if I ever decide to mount it on the wall, it comes with all the necessary hardware.",
