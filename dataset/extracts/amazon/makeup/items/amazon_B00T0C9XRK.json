I usually use L\u2019Or\u00e9al Telescopic which still isn\u2019t that expensive compared to other mascara\u2026 but I\u2019ve noticed that mascaras quality has seem to have gone downhill. I have also used the $30 bottles of mascara as well but for the price point.. I\u2019ll stick with this one for awhile. With this mascara I only used 2 coates. It doesn\u2019t seem to clump or flake off during the day. It\u2019s easy to wash off with just soap and water. The mascara does seem a little dry.. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it. But I will be buying again.",

                "reviewText": "I've only used it for a few days but it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin so far and doesn't bleed/run down into my eyes. It will come mostly off with water so it is Not waterproof. I have not been using mascara for about 2 years due to dry eye and how most flake/run off etc.TIP:: This does have a LOT of mascara on the wand so I found that if I use a napkin and rub off some of it before I apply it that is clumps less or leaves less of those bigger round gobs at the tip of some eyelashes. I also curl my lashes before I put it on and still have to use toothpick a little to space out some lashes.I did wear it overnight twice to test it and it did not smear all over and didn't flake into my eyes, but I mostly am a back sleeper.",

                "reviewText": "Review:\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fEssence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara has quickly become my go-to for achieving luscious, voluminous lashes that rival the look of false lashes. Not only does it deliver on its promise of a \"false lash effect,\" but it also boasts a cruelty-free and gluten-free formula, making it a win-win for beauty enthusiasts who care about both the performance and ethics of their makeup products.The first thing that impressed me about this mascara is its sleek and regal packaging. The black and green color scheme gives it a sophisticated look, and the wand itself is designed to coat every lash from root to tip. The conical shape of the brush allows for precise application, ensuring that even the tiniest lashes get attention.The formula of the Lash Princess mascara is nothing short of magical. It provides incredible volume without clumping, giving my lashes a dramatic lift and curl. The mascara creates a full and fluttery effect that lasts throughout the day without smudging or flaking. I appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on the lashes, providing a comfortable wear from morning to night.Being gluten-free and cruelty-free is a significant plus for me. As someone with sensitivities, it's reassuring to know that I can enhance my lashes without worrying about gluten irritations. Additionally, supporting a cruelty-free product aligns with my values, and I'm glad to see a brand like Essence offering high-quality options without compromising on ethics.The mascara is also incredibly easy to remove at the end of the day, which is a big plus for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of time and effort on their nighttime skincare routine. A gentle makeup remover or micellar water is all it takes to wipe away the day's glam.In summary, Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara is a true gem in the world of cruelty-free beauty. Its performance is outstanding, providing a false lash look that is both glamorous and effortless. If you're in search of a mascara that delivers on volume, curl, and ethical standards, look no further \u2013 the Lash Princess has earned its royal place in my makeup routine.",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited to use this based off of all the reviews (and fantastic price)! I really loved the packaging, the length of the wand (I felt like I didn\u2019t have to worry about running into my eyelashes like I do with shorter wands), and how my eyelashes looked when I first put it on. It made my lashes long and made them look voluminous so I thought that was that. I only worked a four hour shift (receptionist) so when I got home I was super shocked to see huge black rings under my eyes. I thought maybe I rubbed my eyes without realizing so I tried the mascara again. This time I was very conscientious about not touching my eyes and after an hour at work I checked my reflection and saw a decent amount of fallout from the mascara under my eyes. I\u2019m not sure if I got a defective formula or not but I figured I\u2019d hop on to share. I really liked it initially which is why I gave three stars, but my under eyes were raw after constantly swiping underneath so I didn\u2019t have raccoon eyes throughout the day. Glad it works for others though!",
