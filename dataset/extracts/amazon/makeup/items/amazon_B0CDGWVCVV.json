The quality isn't too bad either, the eyeshadow trays include nudes, browns, yellows, tans and more on one side and greens, grays, lavenders, purples and dark pinks. Very nice they and they all go on smoothly and stay vibrant. Doesn't feel caked on either. There's also a tray with glittery cream like eye shadows, and then a row of concealers in every color. The last tray has contours colors and blush colors. Also has 4 small lip colors one gloss which aren't the best for long wear they start to clump up after awhile, has black liner, colored lip liner 3 brushes for eyeshadows and one dark brown eyebrow color and one clear chapstick. I love the box so cute and great for traveling. It's worth the cost for sure.",

I\u2019ll be honest, I really love the train cases and know that even if I don\u2019t use much inside, I\u2019ll use that case for ages. I collect many things and train cases are a beautiful way to store them. HOWEVER, the cosmetics are beautiful, 48 wearable eyeshadows! I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019ll wear all but maybe 6 of them. I think these cases are a hidden treasure that many women don\u2019t find or assume they could use. They appear to be marketed towards girls and teens and they are great gifts for them\u2026 but women can enjoy them too. Mine is going on a girls trip and we\u2019re gonna have fun with it. I definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying, that I have yet to try everything in this makeup set. I am a big fan of the gel eyeliner and brushes. When it comes to the eyeshadow pallets. There is a nice range of colors that go on and blend nicely. The plastic they're held in is very flimsy. They ripped when I tried to take the tape off to open them. The case is super cute and I love the color. However, the latch is not to be trusted.",

The makeup is fun for a tween or teen girl as i would expect they would be very excited to get this. The train case itself is sturdy and this is a great start to a makeup collection for someone new to \ud83d\udc84 makeup.",
