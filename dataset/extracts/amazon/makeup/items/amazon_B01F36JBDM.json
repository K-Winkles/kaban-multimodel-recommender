The bristles are not as lovely as a higher-end Beakey I purchased, but I have been using them to apply foundation, eye shadows, and even eyeliner, and they work so much better than the \"nice\" brushes we had in the 2000s. I like these better than the Elf brushes; I paid 3x as much.The box makes it look like a cheap, simple set on the outside. There was some light shedding when they came out of the packaging, but it stopped once I started using them. The metal holding the bristles is cheap, but these should last for years with care. Perfect for a preteen so she leaves your brushes alone, but she will feel fancy. I used a pretty mug to place them on my vanity.",

                "reviewText": "These brushes are great for beginner and intermediate's at makeup application.The bristles are shaped and trimmed well and for the fiber I think they perform OK. An advanced makeup artist or a professional would probably not choose these brushes, but it is normal to start with an entry level set and work up from there, selectively purchasing individual brushes that suit your individual needs.The fibers are OK for creamy products with a medium viscosity. I don't like them for runny products, thick products, or powders. They all have exactly the same texture, and that creates a limitation which will force an intermediate to seek out other brushes when they can't get the performance they expect from a product because of the brush fibers.My main complaint with entry level brushes is that the handles are unnecessarily thick and stubby.And that is precisely the issue with this set!I prefer longer handled brushes that taper at the end. They are easier to manipulate and they actually fit into brush cups. With these chunky handles you have to grip the brush, you can't hold it gently.For storage or display, thick handled brushes need a brush cup, stand, or holder that has a bunch of slots made for fat face powder brushes. And usually there is only room for one or two like that. Forget these for traveling or even for your purse. Just...no!So if you are a beginner or intermediate and have space on your counter and in your display/brush storage roll, bag, cup, holder: go for it.",

                "reviewText": "I started doing my makeup in high school and used my mom's old brushes initially. However, they soon started to wear out. Now that I'm working full-time in a professional setting, I switched to these brushes, which are perfect for me. They have the right balance of sturdiness and softness. Although they may shed some hair, I avoided this issue by cleaning them thoroughly with Dawn. I would suggest these brushes to anyone, regardless of their skill level.",
