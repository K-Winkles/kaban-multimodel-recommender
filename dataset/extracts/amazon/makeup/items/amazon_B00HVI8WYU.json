I had seen ads for a high-end makeup line's green tone adjusting primer, but as I was checking Amazon to see if they carried that product noticed this one in the results. I decided to give the e.l.f. product a try, instead, because of the far better price tag.As a primer, it's great (as are most e.l.f. primers that I've tried), but it didn't do much to soften the redness on my face. The price tag really can't be beat, though, so I'll continue using it with another brand's specialty redness-correcting concealer under my foundation.",

It makes your skin super soft and doesn\u2019t feel like you put anything on your skin. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this primer based on reviews and the description that it helped to smooth out large pores and was matte finish. I have oily skin with large pores on my nose. It does seem to help with the look of the pores and is lightweight and feels silky to the touch, so spreads nicely. BUT it smells like MOTOR OIL! Seriously. So, if you are averse to strong smells, this is NOT for you. The smell makes me wonder what kind of bad stuff is in this product so I don't know if I will continue to use it or not. And it really is not matte finish in my opinion - the shine, especially on my nose, is back after less than an hour of applying.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 to try and I love them both! Mineral Infused primer is like putting silk on your face! Your foundation glides on so smooth after, feels lovely and the tiniest bit covers so well. The Poreless primer is silky too, fills in the lines very nice and wakes up skin but does have that Tea Tree smell to get past initially. I honestly cannot decide which I love more, or which fills in my lines best so I am alternating and hope that's not a 'beauty mistake'. GREAT products!",

It effortlessly smooths out fine lines, creating a flawless base for makeup application. Comparable to Smashbox but at a fraction of the cost, this primer is a true steal. Its hydrating formula keeps my combination skin moisturized without feeling greasy, and it holds up throughout the day without the need for constant touch-ups. Lightweight and easy to apply, a little goes a long way. If you're on the lookout for a top-notch primer that won't break the bank, ELF has nailed it with this one \u2013 it's become a staple in my routine, and I can't recommend it enough!",
