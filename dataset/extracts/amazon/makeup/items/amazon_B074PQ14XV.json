Though, with nothing over it, have to apply super lightly and even still can look a little too greasy. But I kind of like that look.It's great under a light coverage liquid or powder foundation. I hate how foundation of any kind can end up looking chalky and weird, this adds a little healthy glow.I'm naturally extremely pale. Have some natural tan on my body as I live in a tropical climate, but none on my face because of religious face spf application. So i usually use makeup to warm my face a little to match my body. I bought the 2nd lightest shade and it's about perfect. Still looks very fair and matches my natural color, no artificial orangey brown, would likely still look perfect even without a tanner body. But isn't too ghastly/blue tinged. I would think that unless you're going for a full on Twilight/Cullen vampire look, this 2nd shade would work on most very pale girls and be too light for anyone with some color.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is amazing! It's perfect for those of us who don't wear foundation, or a day when you don't feel like it. I don't wear much makeup (gotta show off all the money I spend on skin care!), just this, concealer, blush, and mascara. This gives me just the right amount of glow. I feel it evens out my skin tone but without coverage, if that makes sense. It's very hydrating and blends beautifully. It's definitely a glowy finish, but not glittery. I mix it with moisturizer if I want a bit less shine. It works great on my normal-combination skin, with powder and/or setting spray on my oilier spots but I would say, if you have oily skin, this might be a bit too hydrating and \"slippery.\" You'd at least want to set it with powder, probably. I have medium-light skin with neutral undertones and I have the \"Light\" shade. If I were any paler, it might be too dark, but it works ok.I wish this had SPF, as there are some radiant primers with SPF and radiant sunscreens out there that I keep eyeballing. Other than that, this stuff is perfect!",

In the winter I still like a bit of a glow without having to put on full blown makeup, this Glotion does the trick! I\u2019ve used it with makeup as well. I like that it\u2019s light weight and blends well. It\u2019s a nice alternative (for the price) verses some of the other higher end brands. I was not impressed with the Drunk Elephant bronzing drops for example. This is more like the Tarte glow I was using but has a bit more color to it.",

                "reviewText": "The Lumi Glotion moisturizer is great and provides great hydration for my skin, while also giving light coverage on the days I don\u2019t want to do heavy foundation and full makeup.For work, I have to do full makeup and it gets old and tiring. Not to mention it is so drying to my skin, especially in the winter.Wearing Lumi Glotion gives my skin a dose of hydration and feels so good. It\u2019s lightweight and feels so refreshing on my face. The natural look works well with a bit of a glow. Just add some lipstick and mascara and you\u2019re good to go.This is my first time using tinted moisturizer, so I don\u2019t have anything to compare it too, but love it so far!I\u2019ve been looking for something to use on the days I want to give my skin a break. My daughter recommended a tinted moisturizer. A beauty magazine recommended Lumi Glotion, saying it was a favorite and a big seller.Before spending a lot of money on something I wasn\u2019t sure I would use, I decided to try L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Lumi Glotion moisturizer.I knew right away that I liked the product and have used it several times a week over the past 1.5 yrs.My 75 yr old mom tried it one day when we were out and she loved the way it felt and looked on her skin. So I gave her my brand new tube and ordered more for myself.Lumi Glotion It is the perfect small gift to surprise a friend or family member anytime of the year. It\u2019s also a great stocking stuffer during the holidays. We all need to pamper ourselves a little more!L\u2019Or\u00e9al Lumi Glotion is a must have and a great product for the price point. I will certainly be purchasing again!\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udc85\ud83d\udc84\ud83d\udc8b",
