        "description": "The Real Techniques Miracle 2-in-1 Powder Puff is a multipurpose, dual-textured makeup puff designed to work with powders, liquids, and creams for a soft, seamlessly set base. Perfect for touch-ups throughout the day, the pink side features plush fibers that pickup and apply just the right amount of any powder product to set your base or refresh your makeup. The orange side is made of our #1 Miracle Complexion Sponge material to effortlessly blend liquid or cream formulas. Both sides of the makeup puff are best used dry. Our patented 2-point precision shape is expertly angled to reach all areas of the face- like under the eyes and around the nose. The reversible elastic band makes using both sides mess-free and gives you maximum control, and the squishy silicone insert gives the puff a luxe bounce for ultimate application. Our face puff can be spot cleaned using warm water and a drop of our Real Techniques Brush + Sponge Cleansing Gel, but it is recommended to replace every 30 days if you use the sponge side frequently. It\u2019s also 100% cruelty-free and vegan. We are Real Techniques, the brand of choice for all makeup users, no matter your level of expertise. Created in collaboration with leading makeup artists, we aspire to take the mystery out of choosing beauty tools so you can focus more time on putting your best face forward one blend at a time. From full makeup looks, to quick beauty hacks, RT brushes + sponges are exceptionally high quality for professional looking results every time. BUT\u2026 don\u2019t be fooled by our affordable prices, RT tools are award-winning + purposefully designed because that\u2019s what you deserve. Quality without compromise.",

                "reviewText": "Let's state the facts. I'm not a beauty blender girl but these are giving me pause that perhaps I could be a beauty blender girl. First, these are best used dry. That means I don't need to figure out what a damp beauty blender should feel like, nor do I need to try to wring out excess water from a beauty blender. I like that it's two-sided so that I can use it for both liquid and powder products and I appreciate that it comes in a pack of two. The bad news is that these are not very easy to clean. I generally start by spraying mine with my typical makeup brush cleaner from Ulta. However, depending on how long I let it go before cleaning it, I may have to break out some hand soap and massage it in with hot water. It will come clean. But it won't be spotless. All of that said, again, I'm not a beauty blender girl but I do feel like these make my makeup set better. I used to be a \"stamper\" with my makeup brush but found my foundation still slid around my face. I follow up my stamping with this beauty blender and it's like it makes my makeup just melt into my face and blend in effortlessly. I don't know how it does it. But if you've been frustrated with the result of trying both foundation brushes and beauty blenders, you should consider this product. Just know it might be a bit tough to clean. I will note that they dry fast once cleaned!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is such a cool product for anyone who needs to touch up their makeup throughout the day. One side of the puff is soft for powder and the other side is a sponge, perfect for liquids. The elastic strap can be reversed on either side making it super easy to use and the orange compact keeps it from getting your bag dirty and the mirror is nice so you can apply on the go.",
