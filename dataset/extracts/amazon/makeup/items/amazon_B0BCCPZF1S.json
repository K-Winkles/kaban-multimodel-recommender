The lipstick dries quickly and does not fade or smear when lip balm is applied throughout the day. I use the Julep \"Vintage Mauve\" lip balm. The two colors work well together. The lip balm adds shine and moisture without smearing the liquid lip color.I love the staying power of this lipstick. I recommend it and and plan to buy another shade to add to my collection.",

                "reviewText": "These may be one of my favorite lip products ever. They set down with moderate shine, not the vinyl look the ads show. Slow your roll though, cause I still love them. Yes, they set sticky, but top them with some gloss once they \u201cdry\u201d (which does not break these down, by the way) and you\u2019re golden. I use the Innbeauty Lip Glazes or the Broadway Vita-Lips glosses over them, and the Vinyl Ink underneath lasts FOREVER! I need three dips: one for each side of my upper lip and one for the bottom lip. If I put it on any thinner, the opacity and shine are compromised. The shades are incredibly saturated (except Cheeky). The nudes especially are longwearing, as you can see fading a teeny bit more with the darker shades. I thought Punchy might lean too sandy and warm for me, but it has become one of my favorites. It's reminiscent of a long-ago NYX Intense Butter Gloss shade called Tres Leches that I loved and wore to death. These are bomb, and if you hate matte as much as I do, I highly recommend you try them.",

This color (Cheeky) is a perfect nude lip color, and I don't need any lip liner but I was blessed with normal sized and shaped lips. I found it a little drying after wearing it for 8 hours. The big drawback is that this formula does not play nicely with petrolatum-based glosses, it will become gritty and immediately starts to dissolve when I put a little gloss on top. I know that the idea of this product is to be one-and-done but it was not glossy feeling or looking after dry-down and has a tiny bit of a tightening effect on the lips. I think this is a great choice for a quick look when you need to run out the door or if you don't like going to the gym bare-faced. I'd like to try some other colors!",

                "reviewText": "My review is for the colors Cheeky, Keen, Lippy, Peachy, and Peppy:The Super Stay Vinyl Ink is absolutely worth it. I have owned and tried almost every high end lip product on the market as just an everyday user. The colors are pigmented, they last all day, and don't dry out the lips. The shine does wear off after a few hours BUT the color doesn't. It dries down and stays on almost like a lip stain. To me it feels like the lasting power of a stain, the color payoff of a liquid lipstick, but the creamy/no stress application of a regular bullet lipstick. I LOVE this product.The only drawback is that their shade range is very strange. I love all of the colors I listed above that I purchased, but that is only because I extensively read the reviews and I know what colors I love on me personally. For reference, I am a very fair-light in color. I have dark brown hair and brown eyebrows. I also have hazel brown/green eyes. Yellow to golden undertones to my skin. A lot of these colors are not for fair skinned people or those of us who generally need a slightly warmer undertone to our makeup. It's a very cool-toned shade range.My final verdict is throw out your old-crusty expensive lip products and get these. The price point is great and I feel like I don't need to reach for anything else. I hope they continue expanding the shade range.",

The last one I just got (Edgy) looks super dark and not at all like the color I ordered. In the pictures it looks like it should be a bright pinkish color. Even looks weird on the brush like it doesn\u2019t have any pigment. Not sure if this is sold by a sketchy retailer or what.

This lipstick is THE TRUTH. It gives you the feeling of a matte lipstick but with out being or looking dry. It\u2019s comfortable on the lips and won\u2019t get on your teeth or transfer anywhere else as much as a traditional lipstick. I also love that it\u2019s the perfect red for women of color as well. Not overly dark or too light. Right in the sweet spot of reds for melanin rich girlies! And the fact that you can get a perfect pigment without a lip pencil and all in one swipe of one dip in it is crazy to me. I never really leave reviews but I had to for this.
