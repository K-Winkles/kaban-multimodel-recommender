I'm not sure what's in this that's making it happen but I am over 45 and not a good look. However before I started breaking out it looked fantastic. Great coverage and blurred a lot of my imperfections. I will not give it a bad rating just because my skin wanted to feel like a teenager 3 days after I used it.",

It is a bit thick in my opinion but still spread fine. So far has not broken me out.",
