I bought two shades (the other is listed under a different product, but same brand, type, container and applicator) and bought a third after trying the first two. It delivers such a strong wash of color, yet looks and feels soft. It lasts for hours \u2014 even when drinking water and snacking \u2014 and doesn\u2019t dry out my lips. I do use lip balm under any lip color, but some products still dry me out. Love this stuff.",

I\u2019ve worn it for a maximum of 6 hours so far so I can\u2019t attest to how much longer it lasts after that time period, but I love that it doesn\u2019t transfer or smear at all. It does dry down a bit so I put a gloss over it just to get a more shiny look, but it also looks nice without gloss if you like more of a matte look. I\u2019m really impressed with the quality - especially for the price!",

The color is amazing, but this very much wears like a thick lip gloss. It's not sticky, so I don't hate it, and it does feel moisturizing, so if anyone is hear having panic flashbacks to the '00s, you can relax, this isn't MAC lipglass, it's not a hair prison. However, if you're buying it thinking you won't get lipstick all over your coffee cup, this isn't it. Not a ton of staying power. Definitely more shiny than it looks in photos.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been eyeing these lip tints for some time and now that I needed a particular color for a cosplay I decided to finally give them a try. I got Well-Made Nude and it\u2019s exactly the color I was looking for - it\u2019s kind of a pinky coral nude situation. Very flattering on, even given that I have cool undertones. And I absolutely love the texture/finish! It really does feel velvety and doesn\u2019t feel drying like most matte liquid lip colors. It truly feels amazing on and you can forget you\u2019re wearing a lip color once it dries down. However, it does not last and is not transfer-proof. It came off onto my cup every time I took a drink, and eating even a non-greasy meal totally wiped it all away. And I tried all the \u201cright\u201d things - exfoliate lips, wipe clean, lip primer, fill lips with lip liner, apply tint, and then press translucent setting powder on top. I think I\u2019ll be looking for another product because I need staying power for a con. Too bad because I really do love it otherwise.For those complaining it doesn\u2019t look as sheer/ombr\u00e9 as in the product photos: it depends on how you apply. If you put it on just like you would a normal liquid lipstick it will give a full coverage effect. If you want the gradient effect, here\u2019s what you do (it\u2019s easy and takes 20 seconds max, even though there are a few steps):1. Apply color only to the insides of your lips, closest to your mouth. Apply as much or as little color as you want, it\u2019s buildable.2. Gently rub your lips together.3. To ensure a nicely blended gradient effect, use your pinky finger or a small blending brush to tap the place where your lip color meets your natural lips until it looks blended and blurred.4. Optional - for an even more dramatic gradient effect, take some concealer that matches your skin tone around your mouth, dab it onto your pinky finger or small blending brush, and gently tap onto the edges of your lips until blended seamlessly in with the lip tint.",

                "reviewText": "Picture 1 is directly after application, picture 2 is the next morning, 14 hours, food, drinks, talking, kissing, and sleeping between the two. I know I didn\u2019t take my makeup off like I should have, but this was for science!! And y\u2019all did it deliver. I had been eyeballing these lippies for at least a year, probably much longer. I finally decided to buy and try a couple out! I ordered #18 & #28, and was pleasantly surprised. First, you get quite a bit of product. I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019ll work once you get down to the bottom, but I don\u2019t expect to get there for quite some time. The color payout is nice, you don\u2019t need to apply for a nice look. The color is mostly opaque, but it\u2019s a great color with soft edges. It does not offer crisp, hard lines. I like a more defined Cupid\u2019s bow, so I used the tiniest bit of lip liner in a complementing shade just on that part only. I did not line or fill my lips entirely, just two little bumps right at my Cupid\u2019s bow. The two shades blended really nicely! They feel so soft and creamy, not glossy or sticky at ALL. They don\u2019t \u201cstick\u201d the way other liquid lipsticks do, but the feel is incomparable. When I say they don\u2019t stick, I mean you could maybe rub your fingers over it and get a smidge of color, but not enough to destroy the look. And after a little bit, they just don\u2019t budge- clearly. Anyways, I highly recommend these and personally I can\u2019t wait to try more! I was not offered anything for these reviews, I\u2019m just a makeup artist of 25+ years really happy with this product!!",

                "reviewText": "I feel like finding a good lip stain is the holy grail. So often they wear unevenly and you\u2019re left with a ring around your mouth after one sip of a beverage. Now I see why this is the number one lip stain on Amazon, and I definitely want to buy more colors. It was recommended on one of those buzzfeed lists and so I added it to my cart as an impulse purchase. They were not kidding about how good it is! I decided to take photos of my first day wearing it to show people how it wears throughout the day.First photo: just after applying in the morning, and then blotting once. It\u2019s sort of like a hybrid between a matte liquid lipstick and a lip stain, but it doesn\u2019t have the really drying effect that most matte liquid lipsticks seem to have. What I really liked is that it covered up some areas on my lips that were still recovering from dry winter peeling.Second photo: after drinking a Starbucks latte. Slightly faded, but still plenty of color.Third photo: after eating lunch - again, a little bit bit more faded, but still lots of colorFourth photo: 6 PM and the end of my workday. Pretty impressive! Note that I had not touched up the color at all during the day.",

To be honest, I was looking for a stain that might be similar to Senegence Lipsense (due to the high cost of it) and unfortunately, this is not it. This strain takes a while to dry so I just blotted my lips until no color came off and they were still stained great. It is a matt finish which looks nice. I ate and it stayed on well. I do like a more pearl gloss finish so I added a clear gloss over top and it looked good. I was worried that adding the gloss might lift the strain but it did not. So overall, I'm very happy with this and the cost is excellent (compared to Senegence).",
