                "reviewText": "The color is a great true neutral pink. It's not very pigmented, but builds up well, which can help give a more realistic flush. It comes with a cute poof which works just as good as a brush. USE GOOD PRIMER AND SETTING SPRAY when using this as it wears off very easily! What I've found to work best in ensuring a longer wear time is applying a good, tacky primer or a foundation that can hold onto powders well. Apply a first layer of this blush. Then, apply any setting powders over that. Then, over the setting powder, apply a second layer of blush. Then, set it all with a good setting spray. After that, it can last an entire workday. It washes off easily without any staining of the skin. The packaging is lightweight and small, but also a bit bulky since it is domed to fit the poof. There is no mirror attached to the compact. Very natural looking for fair complexions.",
