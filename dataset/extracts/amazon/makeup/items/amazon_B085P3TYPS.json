Put Mighty Patch on a clean whitehead (the \u201cpoppable\u201d kind of pimple) and leave it on overnight for best results. Wake up to see the sticker white with absorbed pimple gunk. These small (but mighty) stickers trap the pus and fluids from your pimple like a pro. What pimples does it work best on? Mighty Patch works best on pimples with fluid or pus inside. Usually that means whiteheads that have come to a head. With cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist. It does not work on blackheads.Our Mighty Patch acne patches are: - Clinically tested, drug-free, and non-drying. 100% safe and dermatologist reviewed - never tested on animals and vegan friendly.",
