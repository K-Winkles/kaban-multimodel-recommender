It was fine at that, but my hands are a little caffeinated shaky in the morning and I definitely came close to poking my eye on more than one occasion. It didn\u2019t feel great, and I get a certain \u201csharpness\u201d is needed to separate the lashes, but I felt like the risk was just too much.Enter some nice paint brushes I accidentally let dry out with paint. They weren\u2019t cheap ones and I really wanted to try and save them. Between lots of soap and hot water and brush cleaners it still wasn\u2019t enough to really get into the base of the bristles to get out the dried paint. For whatever reason, it dawned on me to get the lash comb to basically break up and comb out the stubborn paint, and it worked amazingly well. It was durable enough to not snap or break or even crack while I was applying force to get out the paint.It actually saved two of my more expensive paint brushes and now lives in the same box with them for future needs. For $5, totally worth its not intended purpose.",

It's metal, durable, and I'll probably pick up a back up.",

However it takes out most of the mascara clumping which is better than nothing. You can\u2019t give half stars so I went lower with a 3 star review. Ideally I\u2019d give this 3.5. To give you an idea of how I do my Amazon ratings:5 stars would have to mean it was perfect in every way - price point, quality, does exactly what I wanted it to. I have to be very excited about the product. There are very few products I have purchased that get this distinction.4 stars - everything on point and no disappointment, but doesn\u2019t exceed my expectations.3 stars - not upset that I bought it, does a decent job.2 stars - doesn\u2019t do as advertised. Cheap quality. Would not recommend1 star - stay awayHope this helps!",
