My lips feel hydrated and comfortable, the color payoff is better than expected, and it's fun to use (click, click!). The color does transfer a little bit (hello, lip marks on my coffee cup!), so I need to reapply frequently, but that doesn't bother me. I bought it in four colors and am so happy with it.",

The color doesn\u2019t last, but I don\u2019t expect it with lip oils. My lips feel moisturized and uncracked long after the color fades. Don\u2019t love the clicker for getting more product, but that\u2019s secondary. Have repurchased because I really enjoy it.",

It is a bit tacky but it is great. Excited to try more colors. I have yellow undertones and this color was great on me and my teen daughter has cooler undertones and it looked equally fabulous on her.",

I hate lipsticks, but I've been searching for something super hydrating but also pigmented. This is the best one yet. It does not dry out my lips yet is super pigmented. I am also highly allergic to a lot of things but this triggered nothing.On a side note I was hesitant to buy this one because of the container color. The container color does not quite match its color. The color is a little more pink while the container gives it the impression that it's a little more on the purple/mauve side.",
