                "reviewText": "First I will say that this primer does keep your makeup on. It's sticky at first and not that easy to spread so you have to be quick. But, I am an older female and didn't find the product the right one for my face. It made my face shiny and puffy - maybe that last was sensitivity. I thought I would appreciate the pink and the glow but that glow on me was really just too shiny. It also caused foundation to settle into lines more than usual. So, it didn't do what it should for a face my age. That said, I think this product is probably good for someone younger if you can get past the initial sticky feeling. I also had no trouble returning,so I am giving this 4 stars based on the qualifications I mentioned. I do like Elf products so I will return to the Elf primer I was using before (Skin Suntouchable - which goes on very smooth and holds my makeup just fine).",

                "reviewText": "I have never purchased ELF cosmetics but I had seen a lot of reviews about the face primer. It's very affordable and it does the job. It feels like a glue but not sticky like glue. The moisture is very well balanced and I have combination skin. I have tried other expensive primers that make me oily or too dry. The foundation does last better with the primer worn without feeling heavy.",

Leaves a nice dewy glow also, out a peas size amount on the face, wait 60 seconds and continue your routing. When it's time to clean your face it wipes off easily as well as the makeup too. This is not a filler primer nor have I mixed a filler with the gripper. Best gripping I've came across so far",

I\u2019m not joking when I say that I don\u2019t have to even use setting spray with this, it just leaves such a strong adhesive grip on your makeup that it won\u2019t budge! I also notice it surprisingly makes the makeup on my face feel lighter, too. So don\u2019t be concerned about how the sticky texture may feel on your skin. My love goes out to you, e.l.f!",
