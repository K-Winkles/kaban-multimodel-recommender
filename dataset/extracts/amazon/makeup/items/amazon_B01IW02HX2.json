I wanted to test the colors checking out their pigment, how well they blended, and how well they wore.Colors: Love the colors in the Warm Neutrals palette. It is what I was looking for, for my brown eyes. They are quite pigmented and you can build up the color if needed.Blending: I am no make up professional. With that said, I find these blend well. I feel as well as my old go-to Tarte Tartelette cool tones. That being a $45.00+ pallette, this is what sparked my search for more affordable decent make up. Saving money is pretty important to me these days.Wear: The eyeshadow last pretty much all day. This being just a normal day at work. (Office job) I do use the e.l.f setting spray \"Stay All Night\". Added note; Great swap for the Urban Decay \"All Nighter\".Long story short, it's worth it. And for what it worth, I suggested my mother and sister try this product too. (They were blessed with beautiful bule/green eyes so they may need different colors.)",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this palette! I bought this set as a dupe for the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and it's perfect! The colors are vibrant and highly-pigmented and last all day. The shadows go on smoothly and don't crease after hours of wear. I do use a primer with all my eyeshadow, which dramatically increases the staying power, but this still lasts like some of my higher end shadows.I have green eyes and love the versatility of this palette for both every day use and special occassion makeup. I can use this for subtle color or for a smoky, dramatic eye with equal ease. I suspect that all eye colors would look beautiful with this palette as the shades seem universally flattering and high quality.Highly recommend! Buy this, you won't regret it!",

The pigmentation is strong on all of these, they blend just fine and I have used them with and without a primer successfully. The primer I would say is what you\u2019d want to go with to help them stick and be stronger colors, but in a pinch without is fine. I tried a white primer and that made them even bolder. The glitter is super fine and not obnoxious so it\u2019s very everyday or work wear appropriate.",
