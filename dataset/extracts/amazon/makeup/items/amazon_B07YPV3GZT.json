What I do have a problem with is uneven tones on various areas of my face due to my age. I'm 52 & don't spend a lot of time in the sun as I would rather avoid wrinkles & surgical procedures that can be very costly. I have darker tones under my eyes & just not a full even tone in other areas. I love the amazingly light weight & also thickness as when I do use it when I'm in a hurry & don't have time to contour. It works incredibly well. Gives my face a more even tone to it & it manages to give me some coverage. It comes with it's own application sponge on holder to use & that works incredibly well with the product. In my opinion it is a must have bcuz it last so long & can be used all the time. It's great if your in a rush or you have enough time to do some contouring & is a great addition to getting that perfectly finished look.",

                "reviewText": "wow...what an interesting product. I will update this review after wearing out in a few days when I meet up w/friends for happy hour. I will see how it holds up but also how it looks b/c they are super honest and one is a makeup artist so is always honest with her opinion. as of now, though, here is what i found. It is not super easy to get out on the sponge but i realize b/c a little goes a long way so that is prob a good thing. the sponge needs to be wet like you would use a beauty blender. its nice that it comes in a case for storage although the case does NOT have holes for it to breathe so i will still allow to dry on counter before putting it away. this is important, everyone, no one wants moldy/mildew. let it dry first!! the product has 2 shades on here and i am pretty pale but never the lightest shade so got the nude vs the ivory. the product goes on really shiny and wet looking and at first i thought my magic mushroom was a big magic mess. i was thinking once i put the powder on top it would end up like a thick pancake. um.....not at ALL. not sure how they did it but once the powder (my own translucent powder) was on, it immediately just turned a nice matte finish. not cakey at all. I currently use \"born this way\" foundation and it either covers as well or maybe even better as far as fine lines and pores. the other thing that i can't figure out.....it feels like i have NOTHING on and yet gives full coverage. it says BB cream and CC cream but this is really FULL coverage. amazing as when i go out i prefer full coverage b/c like do look a bit \"done up\" but there is a big difference between \"done up\" and \"overdone\" where one looks tacky. it seems to photograph as well as my other foundation as well. i also did a little test w/a tissue and it does NOT seem to transfer. whoa! a huge plus! so here is why it is amazing to me: this shade actually seemed to adjust and blend in VERY well when usually i have to try a few shades of a brand and even then am often between shades. the other thing is the ease of application. this goes on really fast and blends really easily and this was the fastest I have ever put foundation on. it goes on as quickly and rubbing some moisturizer on. and lastly....the price! i mean really????!!! i am not sure how this would travel being that some others had issues w/the container breaking so that is yet to be known . would prob pack my back up just in case it breaks in transit. so far it feels good and i think looks good too. will update after a few days when i see how it actually does out and about as far as if it turns greasy, slides off, etc. stay tuned.",

                "reviewText": "I don't need to tell you which side of my face has this foundation. (Did half to show the difference) It is fabulous for coverage and making your skin look clearer with no red areas, which us redheads are known for. It's super lightweight and easy to apply. You blot it on where you want it, then use another brush to blend everything. (You could use the included brush but I'd suggest using a blending brush) The end result makes me want to only do my brows, add mascara and a little lipstick and I'm done, it makes me want and need to wear less makeup. The only issue I have noticed is you do need to add a little powder because it's pretty shiny, almost oily. I prefer a matte finish but others like the shine. Setting powder works fine. If you want to have an even looking, light foundation this is really good. As you can see in the photo it matched my skin perfectly, you use way less than other brands, and I really like this foundation. Lastly it DOES leave a residual layer on your skin and in your pores so be sure to use a good oil removing facial cleanser. I've found I have to use a good peel off mask once in a while to really get it all. You do not want to never clean it off/out thoroughly because over time it can leave you with large or clogged pores which changes the texture of your skin and ages you faster. I still love this foundation. Just know you've gotta clean your face gently and thoroughly.",

Reviews seemed to be they either Love it or Hate it.Makes it tough if one is unsure whether to buy or not. I was looking for something that would be better for \"older, mature skin\", and I do mean OLDER, I decided to try this as it was much different than the usual type of makeup I've used.I am, (or was), a redhead, with freckles, sun damaged, super sensitive skin. With only two color choices given, I decided on Buff Beige.I had no problem opening the container or using it. Just followed what it said on the box it came in.There was no leaking out of the product, no mess or torn cover. Using the sponge was easy after getting the hang of it. Just took a bit of \"playing around and getting the feel for it\".So far so good and my Old Fella told me it looked good, and the color matched my skin tones.I feel I might be lucky that I didn't receive a package that was damaged in delivery like others may have been.",
