                "reviewText": "The way this cleanser melts in your fingers is so satisfying. I really love this formula it is really smooth and does a great job of removing my makeup and cleansing my pores.I feel like I really started seeing a difference in my pores after using this for about a week or so. It makes my pores cleaner, which makes them look smaller and less noticeable, which I was having an issue with on my chin and nose.The scent is very light and citrusy which is nice as I really don't like unscented products but also don't want anything to strong.You definitely should use another gentle cleanser after using this because it is oily and a bit water resistant. I usually use this at night to take any makeup off and to clean my pores and then I go into the shower and use a silicone exfoliator with a gentle cleanser to remove the excess oils from this product. For my skin type, I think leaving this product on would make my skin oily and cause me to break out. I do like how well it removes your makeup with out anything harsh and without stripping your skin of moisture.I really love this product as a part of my skincare routine. You get a lot of product and it is good quality for the price. It also comes with a little spatula which helps keep the remaining product clean so this lasts me a long time, even with daily use.",

I wear waterproof mascara every day, and this balm removes everything without feeling like I have to rub my eyelashes too intensely. It simply melts into the makeup to break it down and wipes away. It\u2019s also so light and the scent is super fresh. Additionally, I have dry skin/rosacea, and it has been very calming for my skin. 11/10. Can\u2019t live without it.",

It comes with a little flat scoop that gives you just the right amount of product. You rub it between your fingertips and then on your face. It really feels buttery soft but it rinses off with just water. It doesn't leave an oily feeling at all. I follow with a gentle foaming cleanser but I don't know if that part is necessary. I definitely would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "The first time i used this cleansing balm was in 2021, after that i became a skincare junkie and used many different oil/balm cleansers. I was always hesitant to buy this one again b/c i would have to buy from the official website and I'm impatient lol. But now that its on amazon i purchased it again. This balm cleanser only had 10 ingredients and one of them give the cleanser this strong lemon cake smell, its wonderful. I have the most sensitive dry flaky skin on this planet, and this cleanser did not break me out and left my skin feeling smooth. This completely removed my makeup and has a very buttery texture. I recently tried out the elemis cleansing balm, and its $68. Elemis has nothing on Juno co. I 100% recommend this balm",

I\u2019m not sure if my old makeup remover was causing me to break out, or if it wasn\u2019t cleaning my makeup off all the way so it made me break out. Either way, this has changed my skin drastically. It does come on pretty oily/greasy feel, but I think that\u2019s expected of a balm. It gets my stubborn eyeliner and mascara off so quickly without rubbing my eyes. I use a cleanser right after to wash off the balm and my skin feels so smooth and clean afterwards. My only issue is that my eyes sometimes get blurry for a minute after using it because some of it gets in my eyes but the ingredients are clean and doesn\u2019t irritate my eyes at all!",

I used to use estee lauder cleaning balm before but after coming for college its just too expensuve but then i found this and i am never going back. It removed waterproof mascara and all the dirt. The thing i really liked is that it moisturizes ur skin too as it has vitamin e and other natural ingredients so when u r back late and exhausted u can just use this and go to sleep",

                "reviewText": "I stumbled across this when looking for a makeup remover after finding every single one I use just not getting everything off as I wear a lot of heavy make up. This stuff is amazing, you only need a little bit to go a long way, and you can do multiple cleanses and it doesn't irritate your skin in any way. It melts off the makeup like magic, even eye make up. You can rub it all over your eyes to get off mascara and it doesn't irritate your eyes like other products. I use re-useable/washable makeup remover pads that were cheap and they work ideal with it! It is a luxury product with an extremely affordable price. I will not use anything else now, so pleased I came across this, I recommend to anyone even if you have sensitive skin, it works wonders! I now don't dread taking off my makeup!!",

It is a very nice gesture, in this age of non-human interface purchasingThe cleansing balm itself is beautiful: it has a really calming citrusy/vanilla smell that just feels refreshing and comforting at the end of the day. And it glides on easily on the face. The spatula was very useful in getting just the right amount of product.I have been using Elemis cleansing balm for quite awhile. This is a refreshing switch up that works well cleaning the face",

The ingredients are clean and it does the job perfectly with the smallest amount of product, it takes off a full face of makeup including waterproof mascara without making your eyes cloudy. It has an amazing scent as well and it doesn\u2019t leave the skin oily but only fresh and clean. I love it and I will be getting it again as soon as I run out. It lasts me about 3 months considering I only wear makeup about 2/3 times a week. I highly recommend it!!!",
