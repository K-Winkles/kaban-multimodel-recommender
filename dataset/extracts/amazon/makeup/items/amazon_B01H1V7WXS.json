Covers so nicely but also looks natural, not like I\u2019m trying too hard. I\u2019ve got 4 kids and little time to make my face look somewhat awake, so this is fast, easy, and makes me feel good. That\u2019s what\u2019s it all about right! Repeat customer on this one for sure! I also dropped it by accident yesterday and it didn\u2019t break or crumble!!!",

It's enough coverage to look soft and smooth without looking painted or fake. I use a little mascara and a wee bit of blush, shiny chapstick, and I'm ready to go. I still look like a grandma, but a grandma with balanced skin and a bright smile. I will add that in the summer, I used the next-to-lightest color and it fit perfectly, but as the sunshine left my skin, I had to move to the lightest shade in order to feel as if the tint matches my skin tone.",

                "reviewText": "I normally wear Estee Lauder double-wear powder makeup. I was searching for a less expensive alternative. This is a good alternative for a sheer, but somewhat buildable coverage makeup. It is not as opaque as the doublewear, nor does it have the same stay in place ability over time. BUT it is a great alternative for a light, everyday makeup. I don't find it drying, but I do use moisturizer. I don't find that it falls into my fine lines and wrinkles as much as different brands of the same type of makeup. Also, I find it very hard to match my color in almost all brands except Estee, but this one does! I wear this pretty much every day. The real test will come in the humid summer months. Something else to add, for those like myself, I find that most powder makeups make my face itch, this one does not. For the price, I think it's a great makeup.",

                "reviewText": "I'm almost 60/F, some wrinkles and a fair amount of discoloration, red spots, and sun damage, esp. on cheeks.This foundation (baked balance and brighten, color FAIR) is really easy to use. Feels like nothing, even when building. I used only basic, soft, fluffy brushes I had on hand; they worked well for light coverage, but I do think a denser brush option - like a retracting kabuki, as recommended - might work better for building.Very good coverage on bare skin (moisturizar only), pracrically perfect over an inexpensive primer. Almost all my flaws disappeared, even without concealer.Did not settle in wrinkles, either. I FEEL PRET-TY, OH-SO PRET-TY!...or, at least, \"not bad for an old broad, not at all!\".I do find that using primer is better over large pores and significant discoloration, such as have I. I used a budget brand with spf 30 and the foundation went on perfectly.It's FAST, too. The longest part if the process is waiting for the primer to dry, maybe 1-3 minutes.Found it difficult to shade match - but to be fair: When is it *not* difficult?Would be a very nice thing if Laura Geller Beauty offered an inexpensive \"sampler\" (say, $5.00 for just enough product for 1/2 face in two adjacent shades) to help in this process.I tried \"PORCELAIN\" first, but it was just a tad too light. The model wearing \"FAIR\" looks like an olive tone to me, whereas (I think?) I'm more peachy, like the \"LIGHT\" model - but I'm super pale...but ... but.. hem ..haw..Seems really wasteful to open, use once and return a full product to try a color that isn't quite right, as I have. \"Samplers\" would really help reduce the volume of product returns, not to mention reduce waste and carbon footprints - just sayin'.Step up,\ud83d\ude00Laura Geller. Make the planet as beautiful as you have me!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I love powder foundations. I\u2019m always on the hunt for kinds that look the most like natural skin when applied. I also use MAC Studio Fix Powder Foundation, which is fine but slightly heavy to me. I thought I\u2019d give this one a try since it supposed to be slightly glowy. There were plenty of reviewers that said that it looked orangey on their skin or was too dark. I ordered a shade lighter than I would have otherwise, due to these comments. However the product did turn out a bit orangey on me. Luckily, I can combine it with my MAC foundation, which is slightly too light, and it turns out ok. But I wouldn\u2019t wear it on its own.My all-time fave powder foundation is sadly mostly sold in Germany so it\u2019s tough to get here, but Amazon sometimes sells it - Art Deco Hydra Mineral Foundation. If you order it from Amazon, it comes from Germany and the packaging for shipping is hit or miss so it may arrive broken. I use a combination of shades 65 and 70.",

I had myself talked into thinking I would never like applying powder with a brush, but after reading the 5 star reviews of this one I tried it. Now I LOVE it. As I am applying it I can actually see my skin tone even out. It doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out or get oily. I love being able to control the coverage as well. I go all day without reapplying and when I wash my face before bed I see the powder foundation on my washcloth, it is still in place. Awesome! I also love that it marketed to mature women as well.",
