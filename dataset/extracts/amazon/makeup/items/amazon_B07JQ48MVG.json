                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is supposed to be their GENTLE eye makeup remover. I have been using the product for years and loved it. I put a small amount of the tip if a cotton swab and wipe away the mascara left under my eyes after the shower. It was affordable, effective, light weight, fast-drying, and never burned my skin. The old bottle had 4.2 oz and the new one has 3.4 but whatever, it was repackaged and I loved the product, right? WRONG! The first time I tried this new formula, it BURNED unbelievably as soon as I applied and and left the same burning sensation for at least 5 minutes after use. I immediately looked at the ingredients and was horrified to find CITRIC ACID as the FOURTH ingredient in this new formula. What the ACTUAL hell is wrong with Rimmel?! Why would a GENTLE formula use citric acid at all? Let alone as one of the top ingredients! So misleading, bizarre, and infuriating! I tried to return it but it had already been past the 30 days. I was finishing up my original bottle and now I have TWO bottles of this TRASH! So pissed!! This is going in the garbage. I would give it away but who would use this? What a waste! How does it have so many stars?!",
