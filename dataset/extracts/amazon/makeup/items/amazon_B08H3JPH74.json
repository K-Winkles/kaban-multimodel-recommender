This mascara gets every last lash on the first swipe. Truly the best mascara. Only con is it\u2019s hard to remove.",

                "reviewText": "For reference, I have very fine and relatively sparse lashes which show clumps VERY easily. They also tend to get weighed down by heavy/wet formulas e.g. Bare minerals mascara. I have tried this washable mascara in two shades: Very Black (the lightest black) and Blackest Black (the darkest black, I think). Blackest Black feels very different on the lashes; while the darker color does give more dramatic oomph to the lashes, it's heavier, dries more stiffly, and is prone to a bit of clumping. I have to be more careful when applying it to avoid the \"spider leg\" look. In comparison, the Very Black feels like a completely different formula. It goes on like a dream, separates my fine lashes, and gives them amazing length without weighing them down. Clumps are rare, and the few that do happen are small and I can easily go in and nudge them out with my fingernail. When the mascara has fully dried, my lashes never feel stiff; they still feel very touchable. I would say it gives me medium volume. This is the kind of mascara that I'd describe as \"my lashes, but better\", a very defined eye look that pushes the boundary of natural. It's also very easy to remove. Sometimes I rub my lashes gently in the shower so the warm water can start dissolving it, and then after my shower I follow it up with makeup remover and then facial wash. I think Very Black is my HG mascara!",
