                "reviewText": "I want to point out that this is my first ever product review because I usually don't care enough to submit one. I either like a product, or I find something else to replace it. I did extensive research into this type of mop, and I am very happy with the result. So happy, it led me to write this review.I have a large dog who sheds a lot, and I am stunned at the amount of hair this thing picks up even after sweeping (I tested it when I first bought it - I don't need the broom very much anymore). This mop is great at getting under furniture and is awesome for a big room. I cut my sweeping time down to 1/4 of what I was spending sweeping with a regular broom, and I don't have to worry about stirring up dust or hair into the air for it to then land back on the floor or my furniture.As far as using it as a wet mop, I saw a lot of reviews stating that people's handles were breaking within a few uses. Mine has not broken, but I think I have an idea about why this is happening. The telescoping feature of the handle allows you to fully extend the mop, but you have to be careful not to overextend it. I think what is happening is people are extending it to the very end, causing a weak point in the handle. When you use a lot of force, then the handle could break. I suggest collapsing it just a tad to make sure that there isn't a weak point in the handle. Also, I have seen complaints about the handle retracting easily while using it. Mine has done that, but it was always due to me not tightening it enough after extending it (you can twist it to make it easier to extend or retract.)I have seen other complaints that the mop flips, especially when using it as a wet mop. I have also experienced this; however, I only experienced it when the spray was drying on the floor. At that point, it wasn't cleaning anyway due to lack of cleaner, so I sprayed more cleaner on the ground and the problem was solved.One thing I don't like about this mop is that I cannot effectively use it in tight spaces, so I have resorted to sweeping or vacuuming my bathroom floor and using a regular mop to clean it. I haven't looked into it, but if they made a smaller mop head version of this just for bathrooms and other tight spaces, I would absolutely buy it. Another thing I don't like about it (along the same lines) is that it is hard to clean corners, so I usually use a broom once I'm done and get whatever corner(s) still have dirt in them. Maybe some people would be deterred by that, but it really isn't a problem. It takes seconds to do that.I have used this as a wet and dry mop many times over the last couple of months and have no complaints other than what I mentioned above. I hope this helps. This really is a great little mop. It saves time and is way easier than the traditional bucket and mop, making it a lot easier to keep up with my floors.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy, easy-to-use microfiber mop and buffer",
                "reviewText": "I bought this MR. SIGA microfiber mop to use on bathroom floor tile in place of the Swiffer wet mop that I'd been using. I figured that the pole handle would be sturdier and that the fasten-on cleaning cloths would do a better job of getting into the grout area between the large tiles, rather than just skimming over the tile surface like the smooth Swiffer cloths do.But now that I've had it for a while, I find that it also works well for our rougher-surface slate flooring in the kitchen as well as our wood flooring throughout most of the house. I've even used it (with the plush side of cloth) to apply a special hardwood floor restorer to our wood floors.As expected, the stainless steel swivel pole is considerably sturdier and less wiggly than the one on my old Swiffer mop. There's a telescoping mechanism in the middle of the pole. You simply unscrew the lower part of the mechanism, twist the handle in/out to desired length, and then retwist the lower mechanism to lock. There's a plastic handle with a hanging loop.The washable and reusable cleaning cloths work well. The blue microfiber side is for wet mopping as well as dry \"dusting\" since the microfiber attracts dust and small particles. The opposite side of the cleaning cloth is a beige plush that I've used for applying polish or wood restoring products to my wood floors. The cleaning cloths clip in and out of the mop plate easily and machine wash/dry well.The only thing that sort of bugs me is that the cleaning cloths extend beyond the ends of the mop plate. While it's nice to have the cleaning cloths extend out a tiny amount in order to avoid scratching baseboard trim or furniture, I really think it extends out too far in that it makes it harder to put any cleaning pressure on the very edges if you're mopping along a wall.I've actually found the little included dirt removal tool to be handy for when I'm mopping particularly dirty floors (I have a very large dog who often tracks in mud to our aptly named mudroom/laundry room). While I often just rinse the cleaning cloths off in the sink, it's sometimes more convenient to dip the mop head into a bucket of hot water with cleanser. When I do that, the dirt removal tool allows me to scrape or almost \"squeegee\" the dirty water from the mop before touching the floor with it again.",

Ich mag den Dreck nicht im Haus verteilen, deshalb wische ich nicht mit Eimerwasser. Die mitgelieferten drei Lappen sind doppellagig, f\u00fchlen sich hochwertig an und sind sauber vern\u00e4ht. Der schwere Stiel ist l\u00e4ngenverstellbar und f\u00fchlt sich robust an. Die Unterseite der Wischerplatte ist mit stabilen, abgerundeten Gumminoppen \u00fcberzogen. Ich vermute, dass das Wischergebnis dadurch verbessert und der Lappen zus\u00e4tzlich in Position gehalten wird, so dass kein Zug auf die Klemmb\u00fcgel ausge\u00fcbt wird. Das Wischergelenk ist auch praktisch, um den Wischer geschmeidig in B\u00f6gen zu bewegen. Ein tolles Teil, das hoffentlich lange h\u00e4lt.",
