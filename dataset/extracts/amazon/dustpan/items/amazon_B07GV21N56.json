Compact Storage The brush snaps into the dustpan, keeping it compact. 2-in-1 dust pan set has been ergonomically designed to make sweeping up easier. The hand brush has two different types of bristle - soft bristles for dust and smaller particles and stiffer bristles for getting into edges and corners. The dustpan handle has a moulded handgrip to make it more comfortable to hold. Made from durable plastic. Box Contains 1 x Dustpan and Brush",

The brush fits well into the dustpan. There's a little hole at the top so that I can hang in on a nail in our utility closet. The handle of the brush is rounded and comfortable to hold. The dustpan actually works, it has a nice rubbery edge that fits flat against the floor. The bristles on the brush are soft enough to scoot the dirt into the dustpan, but not so hard that dirt goes flying when sweeping up - the bristles are just right.This set picked up crumbs, apple seeds, and also fine dust and dog hairs that had collected under the cabinet edge. It seems that this will work fine for all of my needs.I can recommend this set. It's a good value too.",

The plastic is somewhat flexible, so it should not break when dropped and the \"rubber\" edge on the front makes it easier to catch what you are trying to brush up. The brush is held into the handle by slight pressure, fine for normal holding, but would toss it around. The holes in the brush and dustpan handle do line up, so you can hang the set easily on a hook. The brush bristles are a bit stiff and I was flinging cat food initially when trying to clean up.",

There is absolutely nothing on the item itself to indicate this is an OXO item. This dustpan arrives as is, enclosed in a cellophane bag closed with a twist tie. There are no instructions, manufacturer labels or anything else attached. The brush works as you'd expect and is comfortable in hand. But the edges of the dustpan are not sanded smooth and therefore rough, sharp and uncomfortable to handle. Given the price, misleading name, and lacking quality, I can't recommend this product. 2 stars.",

I really like how this set allows you to slide the brush into the handle of the dustpan and then hang the pair together on a hook. Our ruined dustpan and brush were a mismatched set. They are light weight, yet they feel extremely sturdy. The handle allows for a good grip and there is a rubber leading edge to the dustpan that is of course a clean edge at this time. It feels strong enough to take on sharp objects without cracking or breaking. Great set for those messy moments.",

                "reviewText": "This fits nicely under the sink and works great for sweeping up crumbs in the kitchen.I like the rubber lip on the dustpan because it reduces the effort of getting the last of the dirt into the dustpan. The brush is big enough to grab debris that is spread out, making cleaning up messes quicker and more efficient. Since the brush fits into the handle for storage, it doesn't take up a lot of space under the sink.",
