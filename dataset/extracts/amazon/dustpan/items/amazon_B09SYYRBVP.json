                "reviewText": "This product is precisely what I needed for my home. Assembly is just attaching handle segments together and that's it.The broom is excellent, with very dense bristles that miss nothing on the floors. It handles well, and it gets into corners reasonably well, but could be a tad better.The dust pan is sturdy. I haven't had to see if the cleaning \"fingers\" clean the broom well, because it's too new yet, but they look they will do a good job at that. The shape of the bin allows it to stand with the opening up or down, with or without the broom attached. The slanted lip at the front catches everything from the broom on the first sweep, and very thorough. And I love the color; not too \"industrial.\"The only thing I would improve is the hanger holes at the handle tips. They should have a much larger vertical hole, perhaps square shaped, to allow the product to accept different kinds of wall hooks. They are very narrow horizontal slots currently, so you'll need to do some searching for a proper wall hook.",

                "reviewText": "I was very ready to come write a negative review but forced myself to take a step back and I\u2019m glad I did. Let me start by saying this, it\u2019s very important you assemble this correctly.Each box comes with a variety of pieces. The \u201cA\u201d vs \u201cB\u201d isn\u2019t what matters. It\u2019s the pieces with plastic screws vs metal ones. To make it simple, the plastic pieces go into the broom and dust pan. DO NOT try to put them into the other poles. I did that on first try and my broom couldn\u2019t stay together. As soon as I took it apart and started over it assembled extremely easily. Now the broom and dust pan are sturdy.The dust pan when on its own doesn\u2019t stand very straight. However, once you attach the broom, it stands with no problem. It\u2019s a good length but be aware the broom itself is rather small and stiff. It works well for sweeping floors but don\u2019t expect some professional level broom.All in all, it\u2019s probably more like 3.5 stars but I rounded up because it\u2019s honestly fine. If you put it together correctly it\u2019s a good broom.",

                "reviewText": "First Impressions:1) it is NOT extendable. This claim is a GIMMICK. It simply has two 3-piece poles. They claim it is extendable and adjustable to suit your height. I am 5'6\", and fully assembled it is OK, but a little short for me. The only adjustment is to remove the middle pole piece and make it 2' tall...NO GOOD. I am quite short, and I feel this needs to be taller.2) it is NOT sturdy. the pole sections are flimsy, very thin metal, and definitely not something that will withstand a lot of usage3) they claimed list price is $49.95 on sale for $29.95. I would put the fair price point at $19.95 perhaps even $24.95. BUT this list price is a GIMMICK4) it doesn't stand well on its own, but I don't call this a negative since I'd rather have taller poles for ergonomics. So, I'd rather they supply poles tall enough for a 5.5' man and drop the claim of it standing up on its own5) it's not really designed for holding a bag. It does have clips, but either the bag or the dustpan squeegy becomes moot....and it doesn't fit the grocery store bags that became outlawed this month in PA.....and IT DOESN'T COME WITH OR HAVE ANY BAG OPTIONSSo, TWO GIMMICKS, and some advertising stretches of truthOn the plus side, the dust pan head and the rake head seem good enough on first impression. There is a rubber squeegy on the dustpan head. I would rather this not be on there because, after all, this is for picking up dog droppings in a yard....so it serves no purpose and makes cleaning it by garden hose problematic because of the interface gap between the squeegy rubber and squeegy metal from, as well as the squeegy metal frame and dustpan.And, I like that it closes to create a seal, so if it is propped up against a tree and it rains, the droppings won't turn into pudding.All of that said, I still give it 3 stars on first impression, because I understand the advertising gimmicks on Amazon, and it's best to rate relative to everything else. 2.5 stars may be more appropriate, but I will revisit once I've used it for a while",
