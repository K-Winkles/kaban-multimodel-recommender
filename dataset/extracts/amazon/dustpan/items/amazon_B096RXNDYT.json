                "reviewText": "I have three inside stray cats I adopted, so I have three litter boxes in different rooms. I needed a small broom and dustpan to place beside each litter box out of view. I am very picky about making sure these litter boxes are scooped out daily and that any litter on the floor is swept up. I bought these due to the reasonable price, the fact that the broom snaps into the dustpan, and that they have a rubber type layer on the bottom of the dustpan to facilitate in sweeping this litter up. These do the trick. Of course, they do not work as perfectly as a larger one, and it takes double the sweeping to get it done. Overall I am pleased with these and I am glad I purchased them. The quality is good, not cheaply made, and they can be hidden out of view beside the litter boxes. They have been very durable and are easy to clean. That is exactly what I wanted and they work. In the future I probably would not purchase these again, but instead I would chose a slightly larger one. But I do not regret this purchase at all, especially since I got two of them for $10.00. That is an awesome deal!",
