                "reviewText": "I do like this upright dust pan, but it could be better. As several reviewers have noted, the bottom of the pan has a slight upward warp up in the center instead of being flat, so dirt and debris will be swept under the warp as well as in the pan. I placed heavy books in the pan for a day or two, and this made the pan bottom perfectly flat.I do like the pan tilts up when the handle is lifted, trapping the dust and debris inside, but I did find it awkward to dispose of the contents in the trash, because the pan swivels up and down while you're trying to do that. Not impossible, but it would be much easier if the pan could be locked in the down position when you're emptying it. That would be a definite improvement.As some others have mentioned, the bottom lip of the pan is naked plastic and isn't beveled or tipped like most dust pans, so a little more effort is required to get everything in it. Not a deal breaker, but it definitely would be an improvement adding to the value of the product.I do find it useful, but the product seems more like a good prototype rather than the finished product. The improvements I suggested would make it a much better product. That might add to the cost, but not substantially as this is mass-produced. I would be willing to pay the added cost.",
