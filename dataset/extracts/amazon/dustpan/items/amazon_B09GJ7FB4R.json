They work perfect for that, and are small, so I just hang one on the end of my paper towel holder. These are not high-quality brooms. The bristles are super soft and it won\u2019t pick up pine needles on a wooden picnic table. If you need it to pick up heavier things\u2026the bristles could be cut down to make them firmer. I tried this with one of the three and it worked better. The dustpan is nothing to write home about, but depending on your needs\u2026it can work fine. I threw mine away, as I just sweep pine needles back into the dirt, and the brooms hang up without requiring the pan to be attached.",
