I love mine! \ud83d\ude0a The little rubber flap along the bottom of the pan ensures that you get every little spec off the surface you're cleaning. Love the way the pan handle grips the brush for storage too. I keep this very attractive little helper next to the kitty's litter box to quickly sweep up any sand particles that get tracked out of the box. It's smaller than a typical dustpan & brush, making it perfect for how I'm using it. I've used it for several other little messes around the house too. I find it much more convenient to use than my old larger ones so I gave those away, lol. I highly recommend it. Oh, and it washes up super easy with a little dish soap, in case you're a neat freak like I am and like everything looking clean and new. \ud83d\ude04",
