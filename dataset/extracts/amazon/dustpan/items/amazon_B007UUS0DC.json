                "reviewText": "I read another review saying that this model of this dust pan is a single piece item meaning that it cannot be disassembled. There's a similar Amazon listing, but that model comes in two pieces that you assemble yourself and that dustpan is considered flimsy because of it. I can confirm that this model does arrive in a large box and it's one piece. I prefer this as a single piece because it feels more sturdy knowing that it can't come apart and it's exactly like the one I was trying to replace. I had my previous Rubbermaid commercial dustpan for 10+ years of heavy use. If you want a sturdy dust pan, I suggest buying this one piece model.",

The handle is long enough, and I like that there's a recess at the back of the scoop part, to allow your fingers to more easily upend the scoop into the trash. With all the other dust pans I've used, they didn't have this feature and I'm glad it's there.It has a tendency to unscrew itself. All dust pans I've ever used have done this, so I don't really consider it a problem. You would think they would come up with some sort of way to positively fasten the pan and handle together, though.",

I can sweep and empty the dustpan into the trashcan without ever bending over. This is especially important to me because I have a bad back. I cannot say this dustpan makes me enjoy sweeping but I sure do not dread it like I did before I got this dustpan. A wonderful product and so easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "For home use, this product is brilliant. Works well on wood floors in the home and sealed concrete in the garage.Lightweight, easy to carry around. The edge lip lays flat and makes it easy to sweep even small particles and dust inside. Handle could be longer, but it's adequate. Only real issue is with emptying it, it tends to flop around a bit. Emptying into larger bin or dumpster is not a problem, but smaller bins may be frustrating unless you hold it with both hands while emptying.I'm not sure why this is in the Rubbermaid Commercial line of products, this is not built like a commercial product. For commercial use you are probably better off looking elsewhere for something beefier and more durable.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered both the FG253100BLA (on the left in photos) and FG253104BLA to see if there was any difference. The 104BLA came pre-assembled; the 100BLA was shipped as three parts in a plastic bag. After following the illustration for assembly, I used each one for a while and found the following: The hinge on the 100BLA was stiff, not allowing the bin to drop all the way vertical when lifted, as the 104BLA did. The lip on the 100BLA had a slight curve into the bin, producing a gap with the floor when lowered, allowing dirt to be swept under the bin. The 104BLA's lip was curved slightly away from the bin. When lowered, the edge straightened out flat against the floor with the weight of the bin and handle on it. The 100BLA also had more mold flashing on the bin (seen in the close-up photo). The parts of each unit seem to be made with the same machines, but the difference is in quality control. They apparently pick the best parts off the line, assemble them, and check for smoothness of operation for the 104BLA. The rest of the parts get bagged and sold as the FG253100BLA.",

                "reviewText": "I love this dustpan. I no longer have to stoop down to wrestle with a hand held dustpan. I simply set it down and sweep into it, lift it up (it self lifts to a non-spill position) and dump it in my trash. I find that it leaves less dirt on the floor when I sweep into it so I don't have to resweep and resweep bits that are left on the floor.My grandson remarked that it was the same dustpan they use at his work. 5 stars for this item!!!",

                "reviewText": "A vey nice, sturdy, quality product. And OH SO NICE not to have to bend down to the floor with my bad hip. And the other reviewers are correct, the edge of this dustpan is curved in the correct direction so that when you put it on the floor very little goes under the edge. Most of what you are sweeping up goes right into the bucket and you don't have to bend over to do this.Fantastic!",
