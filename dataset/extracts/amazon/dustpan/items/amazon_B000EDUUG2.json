                "reviewText": "We use this broom in our RV. It is the best we have found but is not without shortcomings. This is our second purchase of this broom. The first one lasted 5 years, so we are not complaining and did purchase the same one a second time. THE GOOD POINTS: It takes up very little space. The handle is long enough - I am 5\u20198\u201d and don\u2019t need to bend over to use it. The angle on the broom head is good for sweeping back and forth. It is inexpensive so when it finally fails you are not out a bunch of money. THE BAD POINTS: The extensions lock in place by extending them and twisting to tighten. Sometimes when sweeping a lock might loosen and require retightening. I suppose I could twist tighten them more aggressively, but am concerned I might break them because.... After five years of use, all three tightening mechanisms failed. I had to duct tape them until I could get a replacement. BOTTOM LINE: In spite of the limitations this collapsible broom is a handy, convenient, small device with a low enough price point to accept the shortcomings and limited life span. If you have an RV with limited storage for long items and want a broom, this might nicely fill your needs.",

It folds down to a compact unit I am able to hang out of the way. It unfolds easily for when I want to sweep out the back of my van. The bristles are firm and do a good job, but I would not call them stiff. It took a little bit to get used to the fact that the broom folds out to ONE SIDE and is not centered as usual. The broom does a decent job but I cannot claim to use it every day. It was just what I was looking for \"A Small Compact, occasional Broom\" . It was well worth the cost.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to store this broom in an outdoor cabinet I have to make sweeping up my sidewalk easier. The telescoping handle fit the bill since the cabinet is 2 ft wide, and the broom when fully closed is less than that. It seems like the perfect solution to my dilemma.I could not have been more wrong.The handle telescopes as advertised, but like other reviewers before me have mentioned, there is no way to lock the broom head in place. It flops around like a flag in the breeze when you're trying to sweep a surface. Rendering the broom basically useless.Even if you're super careful, and don't lift the broom head off the ground, and hold the handle just right, you might be able to sweep something up for a few brush strokes. But that's a lot of limitations when you're trying to use a broom to clean the sidewalk. If there was a way to make the head on this product lock, it would be a 5-star product. But with no way to do that, it renders the broom useless.I'm kind of mad at myself for keeping it and letting the vendor have my money. I guess there was some small part of me that hoped I was missing something, or that it would get easier to use over time. It did not, and I have a basically useless product.I thought about a fixing to head of the broom permanently in the brush position, but if I do that, it will make the overall length of the broom too big to fit into my cabinet. So basically unless I can come up with some solution that I can make the broom head snap into place when I wanted to, and then fold it down when I need it to be smaller, there's no hope for this product.",

I've used it for sweeping off our mats, and for brushing leaves off the awning as we pack up from a campsite. It's super handy.The only real complaint I have - and this is more a problem with the style of locking mechanism all these products use - is that it's pretty easy to twist the broom and loosen the handle a bit. This isn't Camco's fault, it's just how those friction tightening poles work.I like that you can have the broom head vertical or horizontal to the handle, it just adds to the usefulness.",
