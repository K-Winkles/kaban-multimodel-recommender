The brush handle is thick but rounded so it's easy and comfortable to grasp. The bristles on the brush are firm and there's enough of them to make this very effectve at sweeping every tiny bits of debris. I bought this because I was wasting rolls of paper towels cleaning up after my cats ate their wet food. I don't know how they can spew wet cat food particles so far from their dishes, but they do. What I like about this brush is that it sweeps up even the wet cat food pieces and I can easily rinse the brush off in the sink. I'll also say that the pink color is really pretty and vibrant so if someone is looking for a mini dustpan that's bright and bold in color, this is a good choice. It's small enough to easily store under my sink and out of the way. I'm going to buy another one for my sister who is always complaining that there is kibble all over the floor where her dogs eat.",

                "reviewText": "We got my 16 month old this mini dust pan and broom for Christmas cause he has been wanting to \"help\" clean. He absolutely LOVES it & goes around sweeping everything--including the cat (who actually likes it because of the bristles). It is very sturdy & has withheld a toddler smashing it into the floor repeatedly without thr bristles loosing shape. It fits well in his little hands, but I was able to use it myself (an adult woman) without issues either. It would work well for little messes or crumbs as well as smaller spaces. I would highly recommend this if looking for a child friendly sized dust pan & broom (of course with adult supervision) but already this product has brought so much joy & laughter to my child's life. Apparently this will be our new go to gift for toddlers & young kids in our lives.",

The rubbery edge of the pan sits flat to the surface of whatever I'm trying to clean. The brush is short and firm enough to gather all the mess. The only reason I knocked a star was because of the material on the brush handle. It's a nice rubbery material that makes the grip secure and, perhaps, comfortable; however, a lot of coffee grind sediment sticks to it. I haven't yet found a hook that will work for hanging it as the handle is quite thick.",
