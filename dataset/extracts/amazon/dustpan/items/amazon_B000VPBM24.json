For anyone who uses dustpans, you know if you press it to the floor, the gap between it and the floor closes so the dirt doesn\u2019t slip underneath. Well, with this product, it doesn\u2019t matter how hard you press it, dust continues to go under because of how poorly it has been made. Also, the handheld broom is not the same as the exact same one that I already own. The bristles are soft and spread out making it difficult to grasp anything small. Really disappointed.",

For a cheap extra dustpan and brush to have around the house it's ok I guess, but I absolutely wouldn't recommend if you're getting one to sweep up dog hair on hardwood floors, or as a primary dustpan and brush. The brush looks as if its already been used - the bristles are frayed and split. I'd honestly rather use my 10 year old pan and brush that I was attempting to replace than this set.",

Yes, sturdy and all that but it is not very long or very big which I find makes a bit difference. Also, it is made to catch dust etc., and it does, but rather than sweeping it into the pan, it is kept on the brush thus requiring pulling it out. I've been using the Casabella one but the angled tip doesn't hold well, the bristles get frayed, so thought I'd buy something else. Wrong choice. I love how long the other one is & the angled tip is very useful. Oh well, stuck with this one for now. It's fine, it's just smaller than is most useful.",
