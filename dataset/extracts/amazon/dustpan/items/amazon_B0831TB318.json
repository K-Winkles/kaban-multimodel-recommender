This way they don\u2019t end up on the floor where you have to wipe them twice (once on the countertop and then once on the floor).I\u2019ve also found this is great for messes where you accidentally spilled tons of coffee grinds on the floor. I would say this works better than a vacuum cleaner. I have one that only touches countertops and eating spaces and another one that only touches the floor. It\u2019s very well-made. And the brush connects to the pan so that you won\u2019t lose either",

Excellent performance with squeegee/crumb pan attaching to the brush for compact storage. Does a dynamite job sweeping dry items like flour and bread crumbs from countertop or cutting boards.Due to its compact design it now lives in a drawer next to where I do my cutting, prep and mixing. 10 out of 10!",

There's no lip on my sink, so the counters often get really wet when doing dishes. The squeegee lets me sweep the water back into the sink without wasting a paper towel or soaking one of my dish towels. The little crumb brush is also a great upgrade from using your hands to sweep, but the squeegee was the game changer for me!",
