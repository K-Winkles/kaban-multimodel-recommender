                "reviewText": "After four months of use and hanging it by the handle, the three different shaft pieces would slide off onto the floor. I have to place a screw on each joint in order to keep the sections together. A second concern is that the bristles are good for sweeping the floor and the broom is light weight. However, the bristles are not strong enough to sweep dead grass off from a low pile rug. If the bristles were just a little thicker or stiff, this would be a great combination. I have two different brooms that are very similar. I purchased this one because the bottom of the broom can be adjusted. Although it is lighter and easier to use, the fact that it came apart at the joints and the bristles are too light for sweeping off a flat run, I would recommend something different to avoid these issues.",

The plastic strip on the edge of the dustpan was curled and warped in a way that made it impossible to brush dirt into the dustpan - in essence the plastic strip made the dustpan completely defective. Poor materials are likely the cause - if the plastic had been more rigid it would have worked.",
