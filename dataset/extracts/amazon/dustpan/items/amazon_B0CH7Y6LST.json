It sweeps up the little debris with no problem but anything larger than just soil doesn\u2019t sweep up very well. The floor in my greenhouse tends to get a lot of pinestraw, grass etc. tracked in on your feet and the dustpan is not big enough to handle the larger pieces , it\u2019s just too narrow. But I do love it for sweeping up dust and dirt\u2026 if that\u2019s what you intend to use it for then you will love it too.",
