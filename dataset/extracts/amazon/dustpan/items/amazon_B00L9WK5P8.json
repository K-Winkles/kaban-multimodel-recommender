When it's fully extended, the broom and dustpan are great for sweeping large areas, and then the broom retracts with a quick twist to easily sweep dirt piles into the dustpan. The broom has flagged bristles resulting in a larger surface area and a soft, feathered texture that effectively grabs dust and dirt. The dustpan features teeth to comb out dirt and a flexible lip that conforms to surfaces so dust is not swept underneath it. The dustpan also locks open for easy emptying. The lightweight, aluminum pole with non-slip grips is easy to maneuver, and the broom snaps into the closed dustpan for upright, compact storage. Brand Story By OXO",

                "reviewText": "I've needed a way to keep my kitchen floor tidy. Using a wisk broom or a normal broom still meant bending double to use a dust bin. That's okay when one is 18, but not so much fun when one is fifty years older. This OXO adjustable broom and its associated bin are just fantastic. The only \"assembly\" required is to use scissors to cut the plastic tie holding the items together, and removing the cardboard labels on the items. To fit the broom to one's arm length is simple. Just pull the broom to the desired length, which allows one to sweep without bending over, and turn the top of the handle to the right. That locks it into place. The broom is 100% adjustable to any length. The dust bin works fine, is easy to empty, and folds flat when not in use. The broom snaps onto the dust bin handle and is easy to store next to one's refrigerator. I love OXO products. They are normally well designed and sturdy. This is one of their best products. I just wish that I'd bought this broom and dust bin years ago. My kitchen floor is now immaculate. Thanks OXO, and thanks Amazon for offering such a fine product!",

I hate the big broom and dustpan sets usually sold in stores, this OXO one packs in such a small footprint but extends to a very usable length.I used it mainly to clean my garage and patio, nothing to complain, very efficient. I'm 5'5'' and I don't even extend it fully; I know this is called `butler` set and some don't like it, but it's the feature that sold this product to me. The dustpan is still generous enough to fit a decent amount of leaves. The comb teeth are practical and I love I can lock the dustpan upwards for easier storage (and no dust on the floor even when I don't have time to fully clean the broom).It's easy to assemble and setup without breaking any sensitive fingers in the process.After a good swipe it is also easy to rinse with water in a medium sized sink, just to get all the dust out of the way.The nylon bristles have some softness, they aren't very rigid, which I much more prefer. But this also be a negative point for others. Some hairs started fraying after good use, but that happens to any broom one actually uses.",

                "reviewText": "My sister had one of these when I went to visit and I just had to have one. The extending handle pops onto the dustpan, which tilts up to enclose the broom portion, making it easy to keep together and store. Where this thing shines is that the broom isn't cheap and the dustpan has a razor-thin but sturdy strip of silicone for getting small particles of dust from the floor into the pan. It excels at this and let's face it: Isn't that what you're looking for in these things? It shouldn't be that hard to find, but somehow it is.There are only two things I would change to make it perfect. First, I would make the broom portion a bit thicker. The length is great, but another 1/4 inch or so would make the broom plush enough to make a fuller sweep. Secondly, I would move the collar that adjusts the length of the handle to a different position. To pop the broom onto the dustpan, you have to lift it an inch or so to pop it on rather than just clicking it in. Neither thing makes this less than the best one I've found on the market, though. I'm going to get another for keeping at work. I don't use the silicone brush cleaner that is also included on the dustpan very often, but if I get into some hair on the floor, that will make it indispensable. Great item!",

                "reviewText": "I was somewhat hesitant to spend $30 on a broom and shovel. Despite my misgivings, I really needed a good sweep set because all the ones I had been buying were always bad in some way: Either the brooms were too short and I got a backache using it, or the dustpan wasn't level with the floor and debris slid underneath it. However, seeing as this was made by Oxo (I'm a huge fan of their kitchen gadgets) I figured I'd just take the plunge.It was a great decision. I love this set! The broom has an extendable handle, which is great because I'm tall. No, the extended handle isn't terribly thick or sturdy, but it doesn't really need to be to serve its purpose. The best part of this set is the dustpan, which not only is nice, large and level with the ground, but the top comb to clean the broom is ingenious! If I only have one gripe, it's that I wish the comb had denser, closer together bristles. I think it would help get the dust bunnies out even more.That aside, however, this is exactly the kind of set I've been needing and I found it worth the extra money.",

No se le adhieren los pelos tanto como a mi antigua escoba que era m\u00e1s gruesa.El recogedor tambi\u00e9n es muy pr\u00e1ctico, no se voltea, se aplana bien sobre el piso para poder recoger todo el polvo. La escoba se mete en el recogedor para guardarlos y ocupan muy poco espacio.Ambos art\u00edculos se ven de buena calidad y resistentes. Son caros, pero valen la pena.",

Ich bin lediglich etwas verwundert \u00fcber die Teleskopstange des Besens, diese kann n\u00e4mlich nur durch Drehen zur\u00fcck verstellt werden und nicht wie erwartet \u00fcber einen Knopfdruck. Das ist ein bisschen Gefummel beim Zusammenpacken, allerdings finde ich sonst das Design und die Handhabung sehr \u00fcberzeugend. Der Preis ist nat\u00fcrlich ann\u00e4hernd doppelt so hoch wie von \u00e4hnlicher Konkurrenzware aus China, aber ich bin letztlich den positiven Rezensionen gefolgt und bin bisher sehr zufrieden mit dem Kehrer.",
