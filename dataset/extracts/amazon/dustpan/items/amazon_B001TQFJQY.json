                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Own a Lobby Pro Dustpan? This is its perfect companion.",
                "reviewText": "EDIT 12/29/15: There are many reviewers giving this broom one star for being too short and not because of any problem with the broom itself. The description states it's a lobby broom, meaning it's meant to be used with the lobby dustpan Rubbermaid sells. You can also see that exact product hanging on the wall next to the broom in the picture I've posted, which should give you a reference on the size of the handle. This was never meant to be used as a regular broom because the handle is designed to make it easier to sweep debris into a long-handled dustpan. To anyone planning on using it as a regular broom, this is not for you. If you're planning on using it with a dustpan like the one in the picture or one that's similar, this broom will work fine for you. I've had this broom exactly five months as of this writing, and it still works just as well as the day I got it.To anyone who might be reading these reviews and thinking of looking into a different product because of all the one-stars as of late, just know that there are many people who didn't know what this product was or didn't do enough research before they bought it. My review--with a picture--has been up for five months, and that's enough visual evidence to show this is not a full-size broom. Sadly, it looks like nobody bothered to click it, and the one-stars have kept rolling in because of the product being \"inaccurately-described\" or \"not what I ordered.\"In closing, this is better than the Carlisle lobby broom (we use Carlisle brooms at work, and they like to fall apart), and I think it might even be better than the one Libman gives you with the set you can buy in the stores (surprisingly, the bristles on the Libman start falling out after a couple months). If you know what you're buying, I think you'll be satisfied.-------------If you have the Rubbermaid Lobby Pro Dustpan, this is the absolute best accessory you can buy. The broom head is soft and works well with the linoleum and cement flooring where I use it, and the size ensures that everything you sweep up goes into the dustpan on the first try. This is a major step up from the larger broom I was using, where I'd have to make at least two or three passes before everything went into the dustpan.I can't take any stars away from the product for this, but it's important to note that the way Amazon shipped this was one of the worst packing methods I've ever seen in all my years of online shopping. The broom showed up on my doorstep packed in a clear, cellophane sleeve with a shipping label attached. The sleeve was ripped in multiple places, but fortunately, no damage occurred to the broom that I could immediately spot. Knowing how things travel through shipping facilities, it's a miracle something didn't bump into the broom as it traveled down the conveyor and bend the handle or take half the bristles out of the broom head. Amazon usually packs well, but they bungled this one.",

I was really really hoping that the plastic brush wouldn't be the kind that had to be wiped down by hand to get all the stuff off. I may decide to cut it down a bit to see if that will lessen the mess that accumulates on the bristles. But it mostly does the job around the sewing room; I seriously doubt it would last long on cement however.",

So that's not the issue because that's exactly what I wanted.The problem is, this thing looks like a toy. Very cheap quality like something you'd pick up at the dollar store for your child to play with. For this reason, it's obscenely overpriced and definitely not sturdy or outdoor quality.Does it do the job? Yeah, you can sweep stuff into your dustpan with this broom. But if you're looking for a sturdy quality item that can be used outdoors and will last a long time, I highly doubt that this will meet your expectations.",
