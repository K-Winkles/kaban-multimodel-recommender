The swinging bucket won't stay, the thing constantly falls over; I can go on, but it's not worth it. If I didn't want to kill the planet more I'd just throw it away. Save your money.",

This means it did not have to be pushed down in order to prevent sweepings from going under the dustpan. The set had a solid feel and the broom head and dustpan do not swivel as some that are screwed into the sticks tend to.I would have preferred that the dustpan handle did not end in a 45-degree angle. If there could be holes in the handles so the set could be hung from a hook, there would have been better.",
