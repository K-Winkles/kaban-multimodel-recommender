            "\ud83d\udc08\u3010Soft & Excellent Adsorption Bristles\u3011Four layers of soft bristles have excellent adsorption capacity, which can easily absorb hair, dust and fine particles on the ground, avoiding dust floating in the air during the sweeping process. And, the dustpan is designed to conform to the ground, so you can easily sweep the dust into the dustpan, rather than sweeping under the dustpan. Makes your entire cleaning process very easy and fast.",
            "\ud83d\udc15\u3010Built-in Cleaning Tooth Comb\u3011There is a row of cleaning tooth combs on the dustpan. When your broom is full of hair and dust, you don't need to fiddle with the broom with your hands, just scrape from bottom to top on the tooth comb, and you can easily scrape the hair and dust on the broom wire into the dustpan. The humanized design can effectively prevent you from getting your hands dirty, making the whole cleaning process more convenient and simple.",

            "\ud83c\udfe2\u3010Stainless Steel Long Handle\u3011The total length of the broom is 120cm (47.24inch), and the total length of the dustpan is 105.5cm (41.53inch). The broom and dustpan set is long enough so that you don't need to bend your knees and bend over during the cleaning process, effectively avoiding your back pain. In addition, there is a ring on the top of the broom, you can hang the broom on the wall when not in use, effectively reducing the floor space and making your home more tidy.",
            "\ud83c\udfe1\u3010Easy Storage Vertical Dustpan\u3011Large-capacity dustpan design can accommodate more garbage at one time.

I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m hard on a broom but when I\u2019m sweeping I don\u2019t want to have to worry about how the joints of the broom stick are holding up. The handles come right off all the time the joints come apart I\u2019ve never used the squeegee and it doesn\u2019t hook on the dustpan so it\u2019s just sat in the closet. The broom is so soft sweeping with it seems like you have to do more to get the same result of a good broom. The dustpan has no rubber strip to really get a good seal so you can sweep in the dust pan but it still goes under it. If you had a room no one ever entered and you just needed to use this on a rare occasion it\u2019ll probably hold up fine but we\u2019re a small farm with children and pets and it didn\u2019t last long here. The broom fell out of the housing and won\u2019t stay in so I came on to order another (different) broom and felt like maybe I can save someone else the trouble by leaving a review.",

The dust pan's edge works well and it having a handle and a comb to remove hair is a bonus. Dust pan handle pieces can be added to extend broom length to easily remove occasional spider webs from a high ceiling. Broom accesses narrow and hard to reach areas in a small home. Replaces my former use of dusty swivel sweepers.",
