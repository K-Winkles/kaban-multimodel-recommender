        "description": "Keep your home clean and tidy with the Casabella Handheld Brush and Dustpan Set. This cleaning set includes a handheld brush and coordinating dustpan for an all-in-one sweeping solution. The brush features a pointed tip designed to easily reach into corners, cracks, and other hard-to-reach areas that would be difficult to clean with a regular broom. The dustpan is designed with a built-in comb for cleaning dust off the brush, and the soft rubber lip lies flat against the floor to maximize pick up. The soft-grip handled brush angles up for comfort and ergonomic use, and it fits securely into the dustpan for convenience. This hand broom set measures 12.5\" x 9.75\" x 5\" total for efficient storage in cabinets, drawers, and closets when not in use. Casabella was created with the novel idea that housewares and cleaning products could be great looking, fun and functional all at the same time. With focus on product and graphic design we strive to deliver products that are attractive, intuitive and supremely functional.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, when I opened the package, I was not happy. The broom was smaller than I had expected and the bristles were slightly far apart, which I assumed would affect how well it picked up small stuff. Fear not! this broom is awesome. Doesn't miss a bit of dust when I sweep, it's compact, light and inexpensive!Despite other reviews, I have found the bristles to be quite sturdy, and the rubber lip on the dustpan works great. No issues with tearing, cracking, or dirt getting swept underneath. Not sure who is sweeping up concrete, but for a house broom, this works perfectly!One side note: If you are buying this for the bristle comb, rethink your purchase. The comb doesn't work the greatest, but that wasn't really a selling point for me.",

I thought it would be a little mini set but actually it's not much smaller than a regular sized dustpan and I just love the brush, which is designed to reach into corners and crevices real well. I especially like the design of the dustpan that has a rubberized edge, which makes cleanup a breeze. The set is very convenient and not only can it be used around the house but it's also great to take along on vacation, plus it's great for car and vehicle cleanup. I live in Texas where there's a whole lot of spilling going on lol, so I will be putting this set to very good use. I am very well pleased and a great price too, thanks!",

The brush snaps in nicely so when I put it on a hook, I don't have to worry about the brush popping off like on another one I bought. It's like they say, they don't make them like they used to. I has a GREAT set from about 15 years ago. Don't know where I got it, but it was quite a bit wider and the brush was strong. Dropped it recently and the tray cracked, so I had to replace it. Looking online everywhere, they don't seem to make them that size or with strong brushes anymore.",

I refused to buy their expensive plastic version so looked further and found this one. I have to say, I had my doubts. That is why I have always stuck with Rubbermaid.I took a chance and bought this one. Was I ever surprised at the well built quality of this Casabella dustpan. You all know how long plastic ones last. They don't. But this one is different in how they made it and its materials. It is strong and durable and the lip is very fine. So fine that I can pick up all the dust from drilling a anchor hole in my wall. I didn't even want the brush when I went to buy it, only a good dustpan that would last. But the brush is decent also and I have found myself reaching for it and it works very well for fine stuff also.Bottom line? From this \"only Rubbermaid will do\" kind of woman, I love this new dustpan and brush.",

                "reviewText": "I know it seems strange that a person would take time out of their busy day to write a glowing review of a dustpan but I just can't help myself. This simple little contraption is amazing. I have it hanging on a hook right next to my cat's litter box in one of our bathrooms. The brush is fine enough that it catches all of the scattered kitty litter on the first try, even the stuff caught in the grout between the tile, and the lip of the dust pan meets the floor perfectly so that all of the dust and litter ends up in the pan on the first pass. No more sweeping around for extended periods trying to clean up the area around the litter box! Even better, no more stepping on kitty litter that my old broom and dustpan missed!If you've ever had the unfortunate experience of accidentally stepping in scattered litter, you understand why I'm so thrilled! This ridiculously simple device has vastly improved the relationship I have with my fuzzy friend. Now we can both use the bathroom in peace!I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who has a cat.",

                "reviewText": "A couple years ago I bought a dust buster vacuum just to have something that I could quickly clean up a small spill or a little touch up on the floors. Well, that turned out to be a bad decision. The battery in that thing failed miserably after just over a year, even though I didn't even use it that much. So this time around I decided to go the manual route and get a dustpan and brush. I wanted something compact that could store easily and get the job done. This set is perfect. The brush bristles are the perfect rigidity to sweep up a spill but soft enough to not damage my hardwoods or allow debris to crawl under them when sweeping. The dustpan holds plenty of debris thanks to its large capacity. The handle stores easily inside the dustpan and fits nicely in the corner of my pantry. A great solution for someone that likes to keep his floors clean without having to breakout the full size vacuum all the time.",
