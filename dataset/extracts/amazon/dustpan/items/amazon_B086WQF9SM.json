                "reviewText": "I love this little pan. I use it for picking up after my cat. I keep one in the kitchen for cleaning up her mat after eating. She drops bits of her kibble on the mat. And I keep the other in the bathroom for a quick clean up after she jumps out of the litter box and scatters that around. Perfect little dust pans for me, quick and easy clean up.",
