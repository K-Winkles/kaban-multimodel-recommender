                "reviewText": "We love this, especially the comb that clears the broom into the pan. Nice. The handles are adequate, if a little on the light side. They are not thick enough to put up with much abuse, like if the handle gets knocked down and you accidentally step on it. It won't survive that kind of \"use\". However, they are adequate if you take care of it. If something does happen, it appears to be a standard broom handle thread, so they are likely easily replaced with better handles.",

                "reviewText": "It's a broom and dustpan, what can I say about a broom and dustpan? A lot apparently! I've been using brooms and dustpans for 40 years, and I thought I had hit the pinnacle of dust picking up when I got a stand up dustpan, no more bending over like you had to do with the old school dustpans. What this set has is the addition of the teeth that clean the broom off completely. The broom itself is soft and sweeps well and the handles are durable, but the teeth take it to the next level, if there are levels in dustpans. It comes in a small package but goes together quickly and easily. Just screw the handles together and you are done. If you are in the market for a upgraded broom and dustpan this set is it!",

                "reviewText": "The Tiumso Broom and Dustpan Set have been a real game-changer in our home, especially with our Golden Retriever's hair constantly making its way into every corner. The 51'' long handle makes cleaning a breeze, and the large dustpan and broom efficiently pick up even stubborn pet hair. What I particularly love is the comb on top of the dustpan, which is perfect for removing the hair from the bristles. It's a simple but incredibly effective addition that has made our cleaning routine much more efficient. The grey and orange color scheme is a nice touch too. This set has become an essential tool in our home for both pet hair and everyday cleaning needs!",
