Sturdy wooden handle that is attached securely to the pan. The lip of the pan is straight, and very slim making it easy to get all the dust and dirt swept up. The simplicity of the design with the natural elements makes so this dustpan set can be stored in the open without detracting from the flow of your area. Modern, rustic, retro -fits well with those design elements- and if not, it's a quality set to be stored and brought out when needed.",

I've had several plastic ones break over the years and I can see this lasting for some time. It's nice and flush with the floor, but be careful not to warp or bend it, as it would be much harder to flatten back out and won't hold shape like plastic. The brush is of good quality and a nice addition for small cleans, but typically working with my own broom as needed, but there are some crevices that a broom won't fit, so why not have a great quality hand held brush?",

                "reviewText": "Okay, I never thought I'd ever string those four words together - 'high end dust pan'. Why does it exist and who would ever need one? Well, I do. I got this for my workshop to pick up what little saw dust escapes the vacuuming and air filtration system. I've used the really cheap plastic versions that always leaves behind that line of fine dust that has to be sucked up by a vacuum. Cheap sets with a brush with coarse and snaggly bristles that manages to miss or let escape half of the things I'm trying to sweep up. And with a slippery pan that allows junk to slide back off.This set fixes all that. The pan being metal has very thin edges so all but the tiniest dust particles remains, and the interior surface is textured to grip and hold the dust from sliding back off. The brush is very bushy and practically everything I'm sweeping stays swept and pushes onto the pan. And besides this set is more effective and efficient, it's also much more appealing. It's a perfect fit for the workshop with its beechwood handles.This is definitely a high end dust pan with matching brush. It's more than twice what the plastic sets, but it's worth it to me.",

                "reviewText": "Oddly, the look is what first attracted me to this dustpan. I love midcentury modern and classic Swedish style. It's a nice option for a smaller dustpan that you might use in a kitchen or workshop.Pros:- Soft brush bristles capture fine dust particles more easily in the first swipe.- The thin front edge allows you to effectively get dirt into it and not leave a line in front of the pan.- The black metal of the pan highlights just how much dust you are picking up.Cons:- It's a bit heavier than your average dust pan, and that could be challenging for folks with hand or wrist strength issues.- The single magnet that holds the brush to the pan isn't adequate. They might've added a second magnet to hold it in place more firmly.- Dirt doesn't slide easily into the trash bin when the pan is tilted -- you'll have to use the brush to push it into the bin.Overall, there's a lot to like here, and this will find a place in my home office.",

                "reviewText": "This dustpan is so pretty. I feel bad using it for it's intended purpose of cleaning up messes. The beechwood is gorgeous (big fan of light woods), construction is fantastic, it's super sturdy, I love the magnetic bit with the handle, keeps everything looking really clean and cohesive. The bristles on the brush are super soft, it really helps you get into small spaces (assuming the wood will fit or can be maneuvered around the area). Does a great job in general as a dustpan set, even just dusting into the pan, the lip is so fine it doesn't leave as much of a line of dust and dirt as my old pan.It feels like this is durable enough that it'll hold up and last for a really long time. May be endgame for dustpans. (Which is kind of a weird thought.) I love that Copco has an entire range of matching products. You can pickup an entire set, have it match, and really make your cleaning supplies look aesthetic and deliberate, rather than some mixup of found products.",

                "reviewText": "This is a review for: Copco Hand Cleaning Brush with Pan, BeechwoodThis brush and dustpan appear to be handcrafted. They are made of metal and wood, with clean lines and no rough edges. The bristles of the brush are plush and thick and easily sweep into weird corners or under odd edges. The pan is flat to the ground and everything sweeps cleanly- it doesn't leave that dust line. There are sturdy hanging strings at the top of each handle. This has a very high end feel for a dust pan. It looks nice. I works well. I can't say anything bad about it except that spending 28 dollars for a handheld brush and dustpan seems a little extreme. The cost covers the quality, but it's still just a dustpan.",
