                "reviewText": "I use this this sweeping up small messes and to get into tight spaces. I raise composting worms and the process can be messy since it\u2019s on a medium level in our basement and one bedroom. The broom gets in the tight spaces under bins, around shelving and such.The bristles are firm enough to actually get most of the dirt on the first pass, unlike one I bought at WallyWorld. The dustpan sits flush on the floor without an annoying gap so it catches most of the dirt and dust.The bristles are a bit too stiff to use on a computer like the picture shows. If this is your intended purpose then the cheap soft bristles on the WallyWorld version might work better, or even a paint brush would be better since firm bristles may scratch up keys and shove the dust under the keys.Overall worth the sale price I paid, which was less than half normal. Not sure I\u2019d pay the full price, but good price during a lightning deal.Overall a good little broom and dustpan.",

The bristles are also decently stiff. For it's intended purpose, this does the job with no issues. And for something so simple, there are several unexpected features such as the scraper at the end of the brush, hanging holes, saw ridges along the edge of the dustpan to filter clean the bristles (Though I wish the teeth were deeper to really filter through the bristles).",

                "reviewText": "I have many other dustpans and they all do pretty much the same thing, however, it was hard for me to find one that was the right size to keep at my desk. I make lots of paracord lanyards everyday and always have little bits and pieces of paracord on my desk, under my keyboard, and basically everywhere all around me. I needed a smaller sized dustpan that I can keep on my desk to make it easier to clean up my mess when I'm done working. This was exactly what I needed and I love that I can clip the brush right onto the dustpan itself and store them together on a small footprint on my desk. If you need a small dustpan to use at your desk like I do, this is for you!",
