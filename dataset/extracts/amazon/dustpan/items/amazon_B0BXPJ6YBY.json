                "reviewText": "I originally bought this dustpan and broom because of the long hand of the pan. I needed a long handled one for our trailer in a campground to help me pick up the leaves outside. Getting lazy and old and don't want to bend down that far. I received it in the mail and put it together in 5 minutes! So easy! It is really well made and sturdy. Like that the broom attaches to the pan as it saves space.I apparently did not read the whole description as I did not see that it has a comb piece that cleans the broom of dust and anything else that gets stuck in the broom. No need to get my hands dirty or take out the vacuum to clean the broom! Now the broom....It is wonderful as well. Long handle and it actually picks up all the crumbs, dog hair and left over dog food that our dog tries to hide. I honestly wasn't thinking it was going to be as good as it is.This is so great that this one is staying here in our home and I will have to buy another one for the trailer. Our old broom is now strictly for the outside deck and porch! Great dustpan and broom set!",

The best part for this broom is made of awsome mertarials that means it is super easy to collect my dog's fur on the floor and won't stick on the broom which is a big surprise to me! Save my life and super enjoy swapping the floor because I have to clean the floor every day by thanking for my precious Cookie's fur. I've been used a few old brooms and this one is the best for me! The broom is enough hard but soft at the same time that is crazy to describe this feeling to collect the furs on the floor then just push them into the dustpan easily and pull up the broom on the upper of the dustpan so everythin will be off. Perfect design!",

                "reviewText": "Update 7-29-23I contacted the seller and immediately they expressed a sincere apology and offered a full refund without even asking. So thank you for a kind and pleasant interaction.Update 7-27-23I thought this was a pretty decent sweeper + dustpan combo but I have only used it a few times and already the broom head will not stay tightened to the \"stick\". Also on the dustpan, the stick is not wanting to stay tightened to the bucket part either. It's not as bad as the broom but they are both an issue! The broom def is a BIG problem bc I can't even efficiently sweep bc the head is always loose and jiggles and feels like it's gonna detach when I'm trying to sweep something up ! Unfortunately my 30 days is up but I just messaged the seller. We'll see if they make things right ?!This set was easy to put together and seems to be of good quality. The dustpan \"bucket\" is pretty sturdy. The pole connecting the handle and bucket feels a little chincy but seems to be durable enough but I really have not used it much. The dustpan has a bent upsidedown L shape so it grips pretty good. The comb part of the dustpan seems to be pretty efficient and sturdy. It does a good job of cleaning the bristles of the broom. The pole of the broom is made of that same iffy thin metal as the dustpan. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible, it's just if there's a weak point in this set it's those. But the broom head is pretty solid, nice thick bristles. As you see in the pictures I chose the gray & bright orange configuration. I think it looks pretty good overall. Not that it's really easy to misplace but the orange stands out. LoL so overall it's pretty decent especially considering when I bought this it was one of the cheaper options.*Idk if they still use the photo of someone standing on the bucket of the dustpan in the listing but I wouldn't recommend it ! It's sturdy but not THAT sturdy \ud83d\ude02 \ud83e\udd23",

If looking for a convenient way to sweep and pick up sweeping without having to bend, this does exactly that! I definitely recommend. Don't hesitate----Buy it----You'll be glad you did!
