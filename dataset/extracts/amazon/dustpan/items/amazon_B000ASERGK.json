                "reviewText": "(Yet another Update: This past week I was picking my wife up at her auto restoration class at the local community college, and since I mentioned in my prior review that these seemed similar to the ones she has there I decided to go in and check. They weren't similar. They were the same exact model. Great dustpans. The only negative I would point out is that I have large hands and that handle stills seems pretty big to me. Other than that they are great.)(Update: Last week I moved a whole lot of blown-in insulation in the attic. I've tried every method possible, including blowing it with a powerful vacuum with the hose hooked to the exhaust port. But when all was said and done this dustpan proved to be the most effective method. It is both light and moves a lot of material in a short time. Back down in the main part of the house I use this for all of my cleanup. It it huge and really easy to sweep into. Really good purchase.)These are almost exactly the dustpans my wife uses at her community college car restoration class and we never can find a dustpan when we need one. So I bought two, since we each have our own workshops. So much easier sweeping into a biggie like these are, and they are so light.I have to admit I was surprised she liked this tip because her hands are not huge and the handle is pretty wide, even for my larger than normal hands. But she said it was exactly what she wanted and that is good enough for me. I know it is exactly what I wanted.I had one main task in mind when I ordered these. On the farmhouse remodel we have blown-in insulation in the attic. I need to move it all over the place so I can get at the current wiring, and then add some of my own. Then I need to frame skylight shafts, and need to patch the openings in the ceiling sheetrock where I removed walls, but didn't want insulation falling down through the holes. So this dustpan will make moving that insulation so much faster. I wish I could stand up and use a shovel, but I can't. So this is the next best thing. Really speeds up the process and fluffs it at the same time.One final note is that this is aluminum, and I originally switched from being a metalworker to exclusively working with wood because I was tired of sheetmetal slicing and dicing my skin to pieces. So I was wary of the potential for sharp edges and corners. They did a very nice job of keep the pickup edge sharp enough to fit snugly against the floor while keeping all of the edges I felt less than skin-slicingly sharp. Fortunately. Great dustpan.",

                "reviewText": "First, this is a really big dust pan. I got two and they are both going to have to stay in the garage because they are too big to store anywhere in the house. Also, not quite as deep as I expected, but definitely sturdy. They will get the job done.Now, on to the troublesome sticker. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested heating the sticker with a hairdryer or heat gun. I didn\u2019t have either one, so instead I ran very hot tap water over the back of the dust pan. Note, not on the sticker \u2013 on the opposite side to heat the metal and the sticker.Run very hot water over the back of the area where the sticker is, moving the dust pan around to make sure the whole area gets very hot.After at least 30 seconds or so you can start to pick at a corner of the sticker with your finger nail. Get a little bit of the corner up enough that you can grab it.Very, very slowly and gently pull the sticker away from the metal, while continuing to run very hot water on the other side.If anything starts to tear or separate, begin again with a different corner. It should all come off in one piece, with almost all of the adhesive. I did this twice \u2013 I bought two of them. Each time they were only a few specs of adhesive left.I used Goo Gone Pro Power to remove the last bits of adhesive. Just wiped it off with a paper towel after letting it sit for a few seconds.That leaves it greasy, of course. So I washed it with ordinary dish soap.Both stickers came off easily this way. Don\u2019t rush \u2013 you want to be sure you don\u2019t tear the sticker. And make sure the water is as hot as it can get.",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with these dustpans. The crisp metal edge makes it easier to get all your debris in the pan and not end up with those pesky lines of the stuff that almost made it. While it might be possible to bend the front of the dustpan, there is no plastic to break or crack, and the pan is wide enough for all of my brooms save some of my push brooms.The width and depth of the pan is perfect. It allows for a gentle follow through into the fan and not a hurried motion which just sends the light stuff into the air and eventually promotes a good sneeze.The size could be a problem, but I have not found that to be the case. It\u2019s also really easy to clean because nothing really sticks to it and because that hump that most plastic ones have at the leading edge isn\u2019t there.",
