It's heavy duty, a good weight for a solid, metal pan, it lies evenly, flat to the floor, doesn't lack for anything that I was looking for in a good, well made, simple, and functional dust pan!

                "reviewText": "Since the 1990's I was buying the venerable Weiler HD 71078 dust pan at Smart and Final for only about $4.The digital image shown is of the Weiler dust pan that has a straight flute pattern, but is no longer available anywhere.I bought a lot of them because I kept losing them by accidentally leaving them in the trash.The Weiler dust pan was made with strong 20 ga steal and was heat treated for maximum strength.I used this dust pan like a shovel to scrape dumped dirt, rock and concrete debris off the groundand to scoop it into 5 gal plastic buckets for disposal.Because the Weiler dust pan was so strong it could cut through hard dirt like a strong shoveland the edge could hit rock and debris without serious denting or bendingso the dust pan lasted till I accidentally lost it by throwing it away.Then all of a sudden I could no longer find the Weiler dust pan in the store or even online.I spent years on the Internet trying to find a heavy duty replacement for the Weiler dust pan.The replacement dust pans I found in the stores had flutes arranged in a \"W\" pattern.The steal was a thin gauge and it was not heat treated.Often the edge was not straight, but bent, because it was so easily bent.Even if the edge was not bent, I could easily bend it with my fingers because the steal was not heat treated.So I did not buy it in the store because it would not last the way I use it like a shovel/scooper for dirt and debris.After much research on the Internet I finally decided to gambleand buy a dust pan online where I could not do a bend test prior to purchase.After reading reviews on the Genuine Joe 58143and seeing that it was letter stamped \"MADE IN USA\"I decided to gamble on this dust pan even though it had a \"W\" flute patternsimilar to the cheap unhardened dust pans I tested in the stores.After ordering and when the dust pan was delivered by Amazon I immediately checked the quality.The edge was straight and with no bendsand the steal was heavy duty and appeared to be hardened and not easy to bend so I give it 5 stars.I was able to bend it, and once bent it is hard to straighten,but it is far more resistant to bending than the other cheap ones that I tested and so Genuine Joe is worth the extra cost.The UPC-A is 035255581431, manufactured in USA for SP Richards to help check against fakes or substitutes.Also, check that the dust pan has been letter punch stamped with \"MADE IN USA\".I wish manufacturers advertised the gauge and whether the product has been strengthenedby heat treatment so one could have more confidence when buying online.I will be buying more of these Genuine Joe dust pans, but at $11!The price was $7.81 Jan 22.That is 40% inflation in just 7 months.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve wanted a dustpan like this for SO LoNg!!! It is the sturdiest dustpan - like the one my Grandma had my entire childhood! Built to last. Initially, I found it a bit heavier than it\u2019s plastic peers - this is a replacement for an extended handle dustpan that I loved!! Except it only survived less than 7 months before a battle with our playful teenage kitty resulted in me getting tangled up in long handle, tripping and the scoopers hard plastic shattered. \u2022 within a few uses of new pan, I realized I did not feel the same tension and pain I would experience when I would use one arm to sweep and the other for following along along with extended pole pan for collecting debris - I actually find this new beautiful dustpan much more ergonomic. It\u2019s much easier to use. I can even place the pan on the floor alone and am able ti sweep debris right in. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase and while I\u2019ll never need to purchase another \ud83d\ude1c, I will recommend it to all my friends!! It is also easy to wipe off so no more transferring dust remnants around the house! LOve!!!!!",

Saw several models that were more expensive that were made of cheap plastic with a cheap rubber edge. This dustpan reminds me of the ones my parents used when I was a young buck. Lightweight, but built to last. Excellent value for the money. Buy one!",

                "reviewText": "As a Canadian I tend to seek out tools that are made in Canada or the US or Europe or Japan...as they are better made 9 times out of 10. This is no exception - thick, quality metal that reminds me of the old school dust pan in shop class in my school days. I was pleasantly surprised, as it is a fair price point. Cheapest? No. Most expensive? No. But for all of you who believe you get what you pay for and simply want it to be fair, this is a great example. I know I'll have this in 25 years in my shop. Quality make. So refreshing in this day and age of cheap junk designed to be replaced in short time. To the Genuine Joe executive team...next time one of your shareholders suggests moving operations out of North America to increase the bottom line, tell them you have satisfied customers who are happy with what you are producing now.",

                "reviewText": "This dustpan is perfect for the intended use, which is to clean up ashes from our cottage fireplace. Obviously one shouldn't even think of using a plastic dustpan for ashes just in case hot coals have survived overnight. Also the medium width makes it a better choice than those fancy but often flimsy brass fireplace tools. The fact that it's black makes it perfect for using in a sooty environment. It appears to be solidly made and tough. Equally important, steel will last for years and be less wasteful of our petroleum resources. When it does wear out (hopefully long after I am gone), it can be diverted to metal recycling.",
