                "reviewText": "It's smaller than I thought but it's for a child so it's ok. While assembling the broom together, I put my hand at the end of the stick to screw in the brush part. That side has an opening and I didn't know the edges are sharp enough to give me a gnarly cut on my finger. I'm glad it was me rather than my child, and also glad we had a stone sharpener to dull down the edges. Apparently it was the side is where the handle of the broom is suppose to cover. Just make sure that handle doesn't come off the stick and cause an accident.",
