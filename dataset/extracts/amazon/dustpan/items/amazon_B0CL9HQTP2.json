                "reviewText": "No doubt you have heard the expression, \u201cWork smarter, not harder\u201d. This dustpan allows you to do just that.What I like about it is\u20261) It assembles and disassembles quickly in case I want to store it in a smaller space.2) The pan has a wide mouth \u2013 12-1/2\u201d \u2013 and is deep \u2013 5\u201d in the front and 3-3/4\u201d in the back \u2013 allowing a larger volume of debris to be swept up at one time.3) When in use the handle snaps into place on the pan allowing the pan to remain in contact more easily with the floor/ground.4) The handle quickly and easily disengages from the pan by simply placing your foot on the extreme rear of the pan and lifting up on the handle.5) The pan folds up against the handle which, since I will be keeping it in my garage, helps protect the pan from being accidentally damaged from stepping on it or having heavy objects fall onto it.6) The hanger attachment on the handle allows me to snap a broom onto it.7) The comb that allows me to quickly and easily remove debris that clings to the broom and drop it into the pan in one step.What I dislike about it is\u20261) The plastic which the pan is made of is of medium weight. It will do the job it was created to do, but I believe its lifespan will be reduced given that it will most likely be used outdoors where it will be subjected to harsher treatment than if used exclusively inside one\u2019s home.2) The hinge that holds the comb assembly to the pan seems to be weaker than it should be and susceptible to breakage or deformation. Again, this is because it is made from a medium weight plastic.3) The price seems a little high, but that is subjective.Overall, this dustpan has much more going for it than against it. In my opinion it just needs a little fine tuning.",

The bucket on the Yocada is smaller, probably half the size, and not as sturdy. The handle on the Yoncada is long and straight. I prefer a handle with an angle at the end as it makes it easier to use, particularly when you are trying to sweep debris into the dustpan.I do like that the Yoncada has a comb at the top front of the bucket to help clean a broom. That is a handy feature.All in all, this is just ok. I think there are better options available at a similar price point.I do not recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for: Yocada Heavy Duty Commercial Dustpan with Comb Outdoor Indoor Perfect for Courtyard Garage Lobby Mall Market Floor Home Kitchen Room Office Pet Hair RubbishI received this and put it together a few days ago. The handle is in several pieces that you need to put together.While I haven't swept with it yet, I am pleased with the size of it.I'm using this for a animal foster room that gets messy with hair and litter very fast. You can't run a vacuum in there as it would freak the animals out, so you have to get creative about how to clean thoroughly without a vacuum.This is a nice large size, which is one of the things I really wanted. I'm very pleased with the large size.I like the brush comb that's built into it. It's a nice size and will actually work well, as opposed to some that I've seen that have been more for show and not that functional.It seems to flip easy enough, though I might have more opinions on this later.My only concern is that the handle pieces and the dustpan do not seem heavy duty at all. I really question the longevity of this, to be honest. The quality seems a bit questionable. That's the reason for 4 stars.I will come back and update if anything changes.",

                "reviewText": "Been needing a dustpan especially in a heavy duty version for our downstairs. I like the bright yellow color to help find it easy at home. A good size and weight. Not too heavy. Very easy to use around the home. BONUS is the built-in comb on the dustpan to remove hair and whatever bleh on the broom or brush!! I hate touching the broom or brush to remove the later. Now hands free clean up. NOW i want to clean up more vs before it was a task!!! Now a pleasure.PEACE - LIVE - LIFE - LOVE - LAUGH - PRAY --- PAZ - VIVIR - VIDA - AMOR - R\u00cdER - ORAR",
