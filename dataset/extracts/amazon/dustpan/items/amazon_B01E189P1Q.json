                "reviewText": "Since there were two, I keep one under the kitchen sink and one on the lanai. That way they are always available. The bristles are soft and sweep up the finest of sand, which is good because my dog drags in quite a bit. Makes it easier for me - I don't have to sweep the whole breakfast nook, I can use this to sweep under the table, around the chairs and I'm done. Great product!",

I have no problem sweeping cat litter into it. It is a little flimsy but then great sturdiness is not needed for a dustpan. Good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got these I thought they were going to be too small but I was wrong. They are just the right size for sweeping up around the litter box and I will keep the other one in the kitchen for a light sweeping of the floor around the sink and stove when I cook. If you are sweeping large areas with a broom you may want a larger pan but these are great for quick cleanups. The pan and brush are both sturdy and don't feel flimsy. I would probably prefer the brush to be a little stiffer but it works okay.",
