                "reviewText": "I would technically give this like 4.5, as it is smaller than I thought, and not solid white, as I thought. (solid white would match my bathroom the best.) But its still really great. So size wise its not like a normal sized dustpan, but the smaller size, about the width of my cellphone at the opening, or about 6.5 inches. This can be good or bad, as ofc it will collect less stuff at once, but will also be more compact, and better to fit in small space, and you can put it pretty much wherever. So I guess I even like it more compact as it fits the smaller space of my bathroom, where I will be using it. And the color is not a big deal either, as its like a tan, off-white color, but definitely not solid white. From the photos you really can't tell its not white as it looks darker than in those photos. But again, it still looks good, and its like a greyish off-white.Mainly: it looks funny which I very much like, and it works well...so I am very happy with it. The brush is strong and moves bathroom dust and hair really really easily, and the base part is sturdy. The handle also \"clicks\" into the base part easily, so you can keep it together easily. Also as a silly bonus...you can move the handle in the groove up and down by an inch or two...thus changing the \"length\" of his nose.......quite a silly bit of personal entertainment...but another fun thing you can do with it.So it works well...and adds some silly humor to my bathroom. Love it.",

For easy storage, the broom handle slides into the dustpan handle. There is a hole at the top, so this can be hung up. The bristles are very soft and they measure 1 to 1 \u00bc inches. The broom will only handle lightweight and small items. This set can easily solve small cleaning problems that larger dustpans cannot get to. It has a cute mustache design on it.",
