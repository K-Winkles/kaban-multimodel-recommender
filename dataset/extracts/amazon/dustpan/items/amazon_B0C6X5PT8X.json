This is a nice heavy plastic dustpan and broom with soft bristles. The handles are metal and screw together nicely once you figure out which piece goes with which... They do take a bit of turning, but once together they hold very well. Excellant quality for the price and a huge benefit for my 86 yr old father to use instead of bending over to use a regular dustpan!",
