            "\u25c6Excellent Dusting Function\u25c6 Our broom is designed with three layers of dense bristles, which can provide a larger surface area to capture dust, and can capture dust and dirt more effectively. The dustpan is designed with rubber lips and the soft edge conforms better to the floor, helping to capture more dust to ensure dust and debris enters the dustpan rather than under it.",
            "\u25c6Long Handle Broom and Dustpan Set\u25c6 The height of the broom and dustpan handles can be adjusted. The broom can be adjusted to 37 inch or 54 inch long, suitable for most people's height, so you don't need to bend over when cleaning. And the broom head can be rotated 180\u00b0, allowing you to easily clean the bottom of sofa, bed and other furniture.",
            "\u25c6Built-in Comb Design\u25c6 The dustpan is equipped with a row of 3cm long comb teeth, which can easily remove hair, cotton thread, dust and debris attached to the broom bristles. You don't need to clean the broom by hand after cleaning, keeping your hands clean.",
            "\u25c6High Quality\u25c6 The broom and dustpan handles are made of sturdy stainless steel, which makes this dustpan and broom set durable. The large-capacity windproof dustpan doesn't have to worry about the dirt in the dustpan spilling outside when it is in use. And the dustpan can be locked in open position for easy emptying.",
            "\u25c6Space Saving\u25c6 Due to the compact design of the upright dustpan and broom, it is not only easy to store and move, but also does not take up much space. You can fix the broom inside the dustpan by the clip on the dustpan handle, then fold the dustpan and place it upright in any corner."

                "reviewText": "After four months of use and hanging it by the handle, the three different shaft pieces would slide off onto the floor. I have to place a screw on each joint in order to keep the sections together. A second concern is that the bristles are good for sweeping the floor and the broom is light weight. However, the bristles are not strong enough to sweep dead grass off from a low pile rug. If the bristles were just a little thicker or stiff, this would be a great combination. I have two different brooms that are very similar. I purchased this one because the bottom of the broom can be adjusted. Although it is lighter and easier to use, the fact that it came apart at the joints and the bristles are too light for sweeping off a flat run, I would recommend something different to avoid these issues.",

The plastic strip on the edge of the dustpan was curled and warped in a way that made it impossible to brush dirt into the dustpan - in essence the plastic strip made the dustpan completely defective. Poor materials are likely the cause - if the plastic had been more rigid it would have worked.",
