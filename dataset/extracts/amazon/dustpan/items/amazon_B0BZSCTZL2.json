Glad it came with two just in case as a backup.",

By each litter box, I keep a small child's dustpan to sweep up the litter that makes it outside the box each day. The problem: the dustpan came with no edgestrip (more a toy than a tool) and had a bow in it so would only pick up some of the spilled litter, I had to use a paper towel to get the rest. This replacement edge strip was easy to cut to length (you need tin snips or heavy duty kitchen scissors) then snapped right on to the edge of the dustpan as if it was made for it. One sweep of the little broom and every bit of litter went into the dustpan. Hallelujah!",

So I'm currently having to been down and forcibly tilt my long reach dustpan, But this doesn't even work that well. So I have just been sweeping and then using my handheld vacuum.",
