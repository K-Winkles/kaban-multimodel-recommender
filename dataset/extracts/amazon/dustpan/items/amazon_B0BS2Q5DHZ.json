                "reviewText": "I love this set. You can clip the broom onto the scooper and it doesn\u2019t fall over. You could hang it up but with the weight of both the broom and dustpan, it always falls down for me. You would want to use a mail or a screw to hold this item. I also have a lot of pets and 2 daughters so there is a lot of hair to clean up. I love that this dustpan has the edges of a comb to brush the bristles off and be free of debris. It works perfectly. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a broom/dustpan combo. It is made of quality plastic and will not break easily. The dust pan also has a rubber strip on the front so sweeping dirt into the dust pan is easy peasy.",
