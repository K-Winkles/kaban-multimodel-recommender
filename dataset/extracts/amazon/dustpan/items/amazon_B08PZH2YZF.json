                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been getting my son involved in household work since the very first moment he could sit up, and I bought lots of fully functional \u201chis size\u201d tools like little brooms, bissel featherweight vacuum, shortened swiffer, and the hand broom and dust pan set from ikea. But he could never REALLY use those things (and always wanted the full adult size any way, sticking me with the child size lol), he struggled especially with the movement required for the hand broom (the kind with a handle that requires a more left to right motion).Somebody on Instagram had their toddler using this one so I decided to try one more child sized cleaning tool. And I\u2019m glad I did. This is perfect! My son can actually use it. If I tell him to sweep up his crumbs or kinetic sand he threw out if the container, I can walk away and come back to find he actually swept up most of it and it\u2019s not just scattered around more or hiding UNDER the dustpan.It gives my son a sense of accomplishment and independence and he loves to grab it and clean things up! Perfect for Montessori followers or those just looking to teach their children to have respect for their homes.I LOVE the little magnet that holds the pieces together also!! Very well made.",
