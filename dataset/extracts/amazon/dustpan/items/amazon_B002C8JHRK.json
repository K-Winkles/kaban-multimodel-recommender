                "reviewText": "Handles come in two pieces which fit together perfectly fine for me once I realized what went where. This rests perfectly against the floor and it's very easy to sweep dirt and debris in with little to no dirt line left behind. Not sure why so many other reviewers are having issues with this unless they just received defective parts, or maybe there's a bit of a learning curve with this perhaps?I used these back when I was young'n working at a movie theatre and it's just the same as it was back then. This dustpan is very sturdily built and nice and heavy so it doesn't pick up easy to let dirt under it when sweeping stuff into the bin and you don't have to put extra pressure to hold it down like you do regular dustpans. It's a great feature, and the bin has a lip on it that makes it easy to tilt into the garbage can without having to touch the bottom that was just on the floor. Bonus! If you have bad lower back or balance issues and can't bend over to far to use a regular dustpan, this one is fantastic.The nice thing is that the tab does catch and helps keep the handle straight so it doesn't fall or move or get in the way while sweeping dirt in. To unlatch it just step on the dustbin to keep it from moving, and bend the stick out again and it just snaps right back out; it's quite simple. Also, the broom itself has two slots where you can insert the handle; one straight up and one at an angle to accommodate your preference.Contrary to some of the other reviews, you really can store the broom right in the bin - you just move the stick aside to get the hook part out of the way and pop it in. There's even a nice clip that holds the handles together, and they stand up nice and straight because the bottom of the bin is nice and flat. And if you're careful putting the broom in and don't get all the bristles caught to where they bend back and aren't sweeping sideways, it won't bow out on you either. How it behaves honestly just depends on how you treat it, - it's just like any other broom of this type.The only con is that the bristles want to hang on to any kind of fuzz like mad, and while it has some slots on the bin holder to help, I don't find that it works very well for me. But, since this is pretty much the same for all brooms of this type and a few plastic rungs aren't really a fair match for pet fur, it's not worth knocking off a star.",

                "reviewText": "I very much love the dustpan. Sturdy. You get the dirt into the pan without any leftovers on the floor. The only 2 things I don't like too much are. First: When I want to fold it back to close it is very hard to snap it into the folding position. Two: Ok I made the wrong decision and bought it without the broom because I already had one. But my cleaning lady decided to ruin it quickly. So I need a broom replacement. It is more or less impossible to find a replacement for this dustpan. Why is this? They sell the dustpan separately. Why not the brooms? Since no other company seems to sell replacement brooms. I figured at least this company would. Sometimes it is hard to understand the logic.",

It helps so much when I\u2019m cleaning and not having to bend over and hold a small mobile dust pan, while trying to sweep the dirt does not go in the pan until after several attempts. This dust pan fits flush with the floor and only takes one or two sweeps to the job done. Makes cleaning. Mush easier in my back and saves time! I wish I would have purchased sooner!",
