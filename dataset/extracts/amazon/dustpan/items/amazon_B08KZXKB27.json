                "reviewText": "I bought two, which is a better deal. The brush handle fits and feels great in your hand, and sweeps up debris easily with sturdy bristles that don't deteriorate. The narrowness of the brush can sweep narrow places. The lip on the pan helps hold debris into place so it doesn't slide back to where it originated. The wider pan helps hold more debris. The brush clicks securely onto the pan for storage, and can be pulled apart easily when ready to use.I bought this to sweep up cat liter around my litterbox, and it works like a charm. It also easily sweeps up the litter that has turned to powder. (Powdered litter is less functional than normal litter, so I like to sweep it away to keep the litter fresh. After I scoop up the used litter, I then use this brush and dustpan to remove the powdered litter.)This mini dustpan is a better, sturdier quality than the cheaper blue mini dustpan I had previously purchased from a \"dollar\" store, but which is no longer available at that store. I wanted a second dustpan for my second litterbox, and found that blue one at Amazon, but the reviews for it weren't as good. So I found and purchased this one. Best choice I made! I'm glad I opted for the \"2 pieces\" deal. I now have one located near each litterbox, and no longer use the old blue dustpan. I now have fun brushing up the excess around and in each litterbox. I never thought that using a mini dustpan like this one would bring me so much joy! It is so much more comfortable and enjoyable to use this well made mini dustpan that feels smooth in the hand, and sweeps up debris with one swoop. A simple pleasure at an affordable, reasonable price!",
