I have old hard wood and dust collects everywhere so I find myself constantly cleaning. The stairs are always a challenge because most hand held brooms have flimsy brushes and dust particles go everywhere. Not only were these bristles great quality that held up, they also held in all the dust! I didn't have to tap it out once on the entire staircase! Another plus is that the pan doesn't have the rubber liner at the top of the pan, so in two swipes every piece on the floor was in the pan. I normally have to dampen a cloth to get the tiny pieces up. I can't believe I'm just discovering this...not that I expect it to wear any time soon, I will purchase this every time it does.",
