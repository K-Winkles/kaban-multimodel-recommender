I'm using mine to sweep up my big kitchen island.It seems everytime I buy a little sweeper for my counter someone uses it on the floor, which turns my counter sweeper into a floor sweeperI like this because when it is showing/displayed it does have a fun color that looks good with my concrete counter. I also like this because I can easily slide it behind my knife rack to hide it from tempting eyes/handsIve been using this about a month and a half, the bristles are firm enough to sweep the small morsels that tend to gather on a counterMy only very minor complaint, the lip on the dustpan has a slight bump to it. It doesn't lay flat, but, it's pretty close to laying flat. I've only used this for sweeping really small crumbs etc. this is a real minor issue.I think this is the longest I've managed to keep a counter sweeper before someone uses it in the floor \ud83d\ude00",
