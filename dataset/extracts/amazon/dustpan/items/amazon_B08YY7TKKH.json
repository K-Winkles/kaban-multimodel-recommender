                "reviewText": "I've been using the same dust mop for 10 years, since it has a washable head, I felt virtuous that I wasn't throwing away brooms or swiffer heads. Except, it really didn't work that well at all. We have ceramic tile floors in the bathrooms and that dang thing was useless.I purchased one of these cheerful little brooms because I was soooooo pissed off at all the cat litter and dust and hair everywhere during the pandemic. Stuff I love:The color.The handle is a great length, no bending over.When I sweep a quiet room, it makes a delicate ASMR sound that is really aesthetically pleasing.It works really ding-dang well. Like, it just really works.BeSt Of ALLLLLLLL -- the teeth that clean the bristles on the dust pan work soooooooooooooo well, it's just a delight. And I am not that type of person. Like, it's so satisfying to sweep up all the crap, and then sweep it neatly into the dustpan, and then scrape all the giant furballs off onto the comb, and then take a toilet paper and wipe the remaining crud off the comb. I have never done this in my whole life, but, I've taken to actually cleaning the dustpan because I like it so much I want it to be clean. And that's WEIRD.The only con is that the dustpan is a tad finicky so there is a bit of finesse to getting the shmutz into the dustpan.I liked it so much I bought one for upstairs and one for downstairs.It does feel a little flimsy but so far no breakage.",

                "reviewText": "I love this broom and dustpan! I'm a black and purple fan and was thrilled to find this set. They are light weight but sturdy enough and work perfectly on my hardwood floors and kitchen linoleum. The rubber lip on the dustpan is a nice feature. Both were super easy to assemble and fit easily in any corner. Recommend if you need an indoor broom and dustpan that gets the job done but is a bit cuter than most.",

The dust will often times go under the ledge of the dustpan. The broom is flimsy it sweeps up string well. But if you need to sweep anything more then sewing madness it would be useless. so giving this broom 3 out 5 stars.> because I do like that it is purple.",
