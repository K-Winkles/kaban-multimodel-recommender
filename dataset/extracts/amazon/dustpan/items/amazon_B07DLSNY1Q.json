Elevated (angled) handle to make it easier to sweep without crouching real low to floor surface.2. Slight hindrance to bench top sweeping with the angled handle.3. Bought this for quick spot sweeping of broken glasses or small debris on floor and seems good so far.4. Bristles are stiff, but soft.5. Bristles are frayed or (split-end hair like) so as to sweep finer dust.6. Good enough craftsmanship in the wood stain and finish.7. Seems durable enough to last for years.DUST PAN:1. Once again the weaker link of the combo2. Light weight - could be an asset or it could be a liability (like it's flimsy and going to break under pressure)3. The leading edge rubber strip seems too scant to stay on the pan or press against the ground.4. Leading edge of rubber might actually tear under vigorous use.. (time will tell how durable it is)All in all , I am not as disappointed with the combo now that I've used it a little while rather than when I 1st opened box ..Ok, I love the brush and the price wasn't that bad for just the brush alone, and the pan could be better but is good enough.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this package deal mainly for the wooden dust broom. I have to say I am very pleased with the quality of the dust broom. The dust pan on the other-hand is simple/ thin black plastic, a bit of a disappointment. A nice metal dust pan or something made from wood would have been nice to see. I for one get frustrated and displeased if all my cleaning supplies are made from cheap plastic. I would rather pay more and have metal or wood. This is the entire reason I bought the dust broom because it is wooden. I ordered a separate dust pan made of metal and in the end got what I was looking for. Too bad I had to buy items I won't use to get there. I may use the other duster , not sure if it will work for my needs. Dusting is usually over tiny delicate things, and this duster is large. Good for ledges or windowsills or the like? Like to add aditional info the fact that the brissels are not made from plastic is such a nice feature and makes sweeping up dust so much better. Natural fiber all the way, makes a big difference. Esp sweeping up loose dog fur . I sweep almost everyday in the summer. My dog sheds. This dust broom is a dream.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m staying with some guy friends while I work an out-of-state assignment this summer. In some regards, they\u2019re your stereotype bachelors. After a fruitless search, it became apparent that the house was lacking a dedicated interior broom/dustpan set and there certainly wasn\u2019t a microfiber duster to be found. I selected these because they look cool and sorta have a masculine guy vibe (don\u2019t want to tornado them with rose gold and lilac cleaning supplies). I can\u2019t stand plasticly generic looking supplies, even those that are relegated to an utility closet. These appear more old fashioned or classic.The tools all work really well! The duster is particularly useful for the leather couches as well as the various antique woodwork that\u2019s original to the house. The broom is ideal for countertops or accessing those hard to reach corners. It\u2019s also fairly easy to clean the bristles. (Haven\u2019t tried cleaning the duster yet.) I would definitely buy this set again!",
