The premium powder coated steel will not chip or bend like other dust pans on the market. The looped handle is more comfortable and allows the dust pan to be hung up when not in use. This industrial dust pan\u2019s edge is thin enough to sweep small items but thick enough to not bend. A ridge just inside the edge allows the swept items to stay inside while work. Edward Tools Black Metal Dust Pan 12\u201d is the perfect size for a standard broom.",

There is always a leftover line of dirt and you try to sweep it up from all angles until you give up and get the vacuum cleaner. I was hoping this one would be better--and it is. But not entirely. When I press it down to the floor, it seems to do better; maybe it just needs to be bent down a bit to form a totally straight edge against the floor. All in all, I am glad to have it.

Still a solid dust pan, a bit more expensive than the old ones due to inflation.Old:Now that my wife and I are cutting each other's hair, we need to pick up the piles of cut hair afterwards. The metal dustpan together with a horse hair brush prevent static hair build up, making clean up that much easier. Others are correct about the sticky label, it is difficult to take off. You can leave the label on, it won't affect the dustpan's function, or you can soak the label in water to remove part of it, then remove the rest of it with Goo Be Gone. The pan is very sturdy, well worth the price.",

It seriously felt like letting it soak in hot water with Dawn dishwashing detergent is about all you would need to get off the rest but I'll update the review if that proves false. Right now it is an amazing dust pan--amazing. And it is pretty (outside the stuck label). And it will fit over your broom handle so the set stays together. I love it.

What a dumb adhesive to use. And you can\u2019t scrape it off without scratching the paint. Honestly if I would have known it was going to be that much of a pain to get off I would have bought a different one - there are many to choose from.",
