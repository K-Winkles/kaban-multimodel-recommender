If I had purchased a plastic one, the AZ sun would likely have destroyed it in a year. It's light but very sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for. A plus is that you can make it shorter by eliminating 1 stem which I have done. If the stems loosen I'll just use a small piece of Vent Tape (aluminum tape to secure it so it won't loosen. This tapes adhesive does not breakdown in heat/cold like some other tapes.",

                "reviewText": "I've had many dust pans and many brooms. The problem with many dust pans is that the dust pan itself will not lie flat on the floor, so one must sweep multiple times and often still cannot get all of the dust into the dust pan.I have had back surgery and am not supposed to bend my back, so I was looking for a standing dustpan and broom set. The broom is about average for the type of broom it is. Everything is aluminum except the bristles. Other reviewers disparaged the broom because it sounded \"tinny\" or something similar. Aluminum is a good metal and is perfect for this application because it is lightweight for the amount of strength. The dust pan is excellent. It's metal and has arrived to me perfectly level and straight, so it catches all of the dust and dirt I can brush up. Overall, it's an excellent product. The plastic ones would have just been frustrating, though they would be cool and the pan would swivel straight, and this one does not. That's a very minor price to pay for a dustpan that will actually do the job.",
