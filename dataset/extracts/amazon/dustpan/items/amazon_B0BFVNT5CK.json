I loved it, but I immediately realized that it probably wouldn\u2019t last too long. It was flimsy, but I still loved it. After a few months, the inevitable happened - it broke. So, I started looking for a replacement. My requirements: a small broom head, a standup dustpan, teeth on the dustpan for self cleaning, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, it had to be lightweight yet sturdy. THIS broom is exactly what I\u2019ve been searching for. I\u2019ve only had it a few weeks, but I could tell immediately that it was much sturdier than my previous Temu purchase. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this broom and dust pan to replace a broom in our kitchen. This broom assembles easily, as does the dust pan. The broom itself is lightweight and sweeps the floor quite nicely. We have five cats, and cat litter gets on our kitchen floor frequently. This broom does a good job of sweeping it up. I like how the dustpan locks in the open position, making it easier to sweep debris into the dust pan. The only real negative about this broom is that it is somewhat difficult to replace it inside the dust pan for storage. The edges of the broom get caught on the opening of the dust pan. It\u2019s an annoyance but not a dealbreaker. This problem could be fixed with a slightly larger dust pan.Overall, I like this broom and dust pan. It will take some getting used to, but once I get a custom to it, I think it will work out nicely.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic broom and dustpan set. It comes disassembled for compact shipping but its easy to assemble - just screw the pieced together. It comes with another piece to make it even taller, but we liked this height just fine. It comes with a clip so you can attach the broom and dustpan together as pictured. The dustpan also has \"teeth\" that you can bring the broom through to clean the bristles. We like the red and black color as well. Being plastic, dust does stick to the dust plan, so the occaissional clean is needed. All-in-all a great set if you're looking for one.",

That\u2019s why I am returning it rather than assembling it. Not at all what I wanted; I should have noticed how narrow the dustpan was and realized the broom width would be tiny.Very lightweight, but does not seem terribly sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "This Broom and dustpan combo are hands down the best i have ever owned!i was little worried when item arrived in parts and you had to screw them together, but the Materials are of such good quality that once screwed together ( BY HAND ) they fit together like a glove! it was almost effortless if i am honest, and yet, it is SUPER STURDY!.I love the Clasp on back of the dust pan handle that you can connect your broom to , and then, like in photo you see, you are able to have it sit standing. which is great to have it near by for ease of use, always together and in one place. You CAN hang them too of course, they have hooks on the ends. but for me, i use daily all the time so standing in a corner out of the way is perfect.what i love about this set is that you can effortlessly take the set around from room to room and just sweep everything into the dust pan and the pan can come with you ! just have it standing as you are going around with the broom, then add what you collected from each room into the pan and move on to the next!the Comb feature which allows you to clean off all the extra dust /hair/ or whatever your broom picks up and put it right into the pan is PERFECT! saves soooo much time , and saves the life of your broom, plus no more bending over to take left over stuff out of your broom .. which if your like me, you leave untill its so built up that you almost want another broom by then .. with this set, that will never happen.. you can simply sweep dirt into pan and allow the broom to be combed through each time ... its so simple and feel so natural .this is very well made. i feel you just can not go wrong with this set. i have been using every single day since i got it, and kinda makes sweeping a joy now !- I defiantly recommend !",
