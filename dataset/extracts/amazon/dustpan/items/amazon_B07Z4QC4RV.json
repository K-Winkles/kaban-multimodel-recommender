So these are strategically located in the hallways of each side of house and one on Lanai. I don't know how I managed without. With the dust pan attached and strong bristles, it has saved me tons of time while Keeping pet fur to a minimum.",

I use it in my kitchen for all the dog hair and other stuff that falls on It. I don\u2019t have to drag out my vacuum. Besides, the vacuum isn\u2019t great for all the nooks and crannies in my kitchen, especially close to the floor near the lower cabinets. I have had broom/dustpans before, but they have never been as tall as this one or as deep a dustpan, so that nothing falls out in your way to empty it. I just had to leave a review about this broom. I just love it. It is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This broom and dustpan was PERFECT for my needs. Do keep in mind as many of the reviews say it is a smaller broom but I love it because it is so lightweight. It\u2019s great for one bedroom apartments and smaller spaces in general. Assembly was a bit tough only because it didn\u2019t come with instructions and you kind of have to figure out which pieces attach where. But I still assembled it in like 3 mins. The broom attaches perfectly to the dustpan for easy storage. The bristles are shorter but very flexible. Love the rubber edge and brush cleaner on the dustpan! Yes it arrived a little dirty but it\u2019s meant to get dirty so idk why all these other reviews are mad about it.",

The broom and pan each have 3 poles held together by plastic sleeves. The pieces do not twist together, they just pop into place with very little keeping them there. I would have returned it but since the return shipping was half of what I paid I decided it's not worth it and I'll use this piece of junk until it breaks or until I get sick of popping the broom head back on that keeps falling off..... then go to Dollar General for a REAL BROOM that is sold in one solid piece. This product is absurd!!!",
