                "reviewText": "After trying a variety of booms and dustpans, even similar-looking brooms and dustpans from this same brand, I came back to buy this Pet Pro set for a second time. It's such a treat to use! It does an amazing job of getting the dust and pet hair off my hardwood floors. This broom and dustpan set is sturdy, easy to use, and most importantly, it works. It is so gratifying to see how much dust and pet hair it can gather -- I want to sweep every day!! Twice a day! The bristles are or various lengths, so they provide a broad range of contact with the floor and quite effective at collecting fine dust and debris. The dustpan is sturdy, wide, and creates an excellent seal with the floor. The dustpan has ridges, so that you can brush the broom through the ridges to get all of the pet hair off the broom and into the dust pan -- much nicer than having to pull out all of the fur by hand. The dust pan snaps securely onto the boom, so the two pieces are easily stored together. I suspect it sounds silly to be so excited about a broom and dustpan -- but these are different -- and superior to -- other brooms and dustpans I have used in the past. The dustpan is really a game changer.",

                "reviewText": "I was about to buy a standard broom and dust box until I came across this one. The hand dustpan has the stepon handle allow it to works like a handled dustpan while making it more compact. The dustpan comb is a good feature but idk why it's only wide enough for the grey bristles and not the entire thing.The broom itself is good. The brush is soft enough to bend but still study enough, however, this softness really means that this is an indoor broom and not for rough outside terrian. Overall, a good quality indoor broom without the bulk.",
