                "reviewText": "This is a nice and sturdy broom and dustpan set. It feels like it's good quality and durable according to modern standards. It was easy to assemble. The broom has very soft bristles making it perfect for surfaces like hard wood floors, tile etc. The broom handle is a little longer than most which is nice if you're on the taller side, or if you're shorter it will help to reach the ceiling if you use your broom the remove spider webs. It might not be the best option for more commercial use like driveways, sidewalks etc. due to the soft bristles. Personally I would have preferred if the dustpan was open on the top to allow the broom to be stored inside, but the closed top does have certain benefits like preventing dust from blowing out when ceiling fans are on, or windows open. There is a clip on the dp handle to secure the broom which helps with storage.",

                "reviewText": "The size and bulkiness of both the broom and dustpan make storage a significant challenge. The set takes up an absurd amount of space in my closet, making it inconvenient to stow away. This lack of practicality in terms of storage is a major drawback, especially for those with limited space.Moreover, the weight of the broom and dustpan is surprisingly heavy, making it cumbersome and tiring to use for extended periods. The ergonomic design seems to be an afterthought, as it doesn't provide the comfort and ease of use that one would expect. This makes the whole cleaning process much more laborious than it needs to be.In terms of functionality, the bristles on the broom are not as effective as one would hope. They often leave behind dirt and debris, requiring multiple passes to achieve a satisfactory result. The dustpan, too, seems poorly designed, as it struggles to collect dust and dirt efficiently, leaving a frustrating trail of residue behind.The overall build quality of the Broom and Dustpan Combo Set is questionable. After just a few uses, I noticed signs of wear and tear, with bristles starting to shed and the dustpan showing signs of bending. This lack of durability is a sad look ahead.Its impractical size, uncomfortable design, subpar performance, and questionable durability make it a poor choice for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient cleaning tool. I would strongly advise potential buyers to explore other, more practical options.",

                "reviewText": "The Broom and Dustpan Combo came with the handles in 3 pieces and they screw together. There is only one way for them to go together so not having any directions was not a problem as they are not needed. One bag had a label reading it was for the broom, the other had one reading it was for the dust pan. They went together tight and they seem firm enough.The problem I have is the pan 'cover' does not line up with the pan opening. It covers it on one side but then it slants leaving a sizable gap. I checked the 'hinges' and nothing is broken. There is no way for me to straighten this molded plastic. This can be a bit of a problem if light dirt is picked up because when the pan is lifted the dirt/dust can escape without a problem through it. The whole purpose of this pan is keeping the 'dirt' in the pan so I took a star off for 'looks' and one for 'function'.I like the way it stores so easily and stays together with the clip. This lets me store it behind a door and out of sight. I also love not having to keep bending down to use a hand-held dustpan.I do like the broom and pan set and as long as I just happened to get the 'bad cover' and they weren't all manufactured this way, I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This dust pan went together really well and very easily. Like any broom and dustpan you sweep the dirt and hair and instead of bending over with the dust pan it is easily placed right on the floor. What I don't like about this is that the dustpan itself is very big and bulky so this combo would not be a great choice if you are tiny living or just have a small space. It also does not store very well either because of the dustpans bulkiness.",
