Sits flat so you don't get a lot of stuff sneaking under the front edge and they hold a lot of stuff. These are great to have around the house. I recommend them. The only complaint I would have was that it took a few weeks to receive them. Apparently there were some inventory issues with the seller but they did eventually arrive.",
