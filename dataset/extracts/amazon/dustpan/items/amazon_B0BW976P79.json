They will be replacing my broom at no cost to me and I didn't have to ask they have also offered some refund. I will continue to purchase and try other items from a company with great customer service. Stuff happens but great customer service is intentional and that speaks volumes.True to their word they sent me a replacement broom. This broom is much thicker and we have not had any issues with shedding. It's exactly what I had hoped for when I ordered it to begin with. And again the customer service is top notch.",

                "reviewText": "There are 2 items in this pack (4 if you count the little dustpan and brush which comes in the box.)The first item is the brush itself, which is about 1360mm tall and comes in 4 pieces which screw into each other, which the handle being the top piece. Once screwed together, screwing the brush into place, you\u2019re ready to begin brushing \u2026 almost. (These handles can be shortened by adding less poles)The second item is the dustpan which stands at about 1600mm tall and come in 3 pieces which, again, screw together. The handle is at a right handle, at the top, and the dustpan is at the bottom.With both items screwed together you\u2019re ready to brush up.The brush head is pretty strong with the bristles made of a firm, yet soft enough bristles which manage to brush up the dirt which them buckling under the slight pressure.The dustpan is moveable, hinged to go up and down so that when you\u2019re brushing the pan lies flat on the ground so you can brush the dirt into it. Then, once done, it can be flipped up to hold the dirt inside, like a small bucket.The pan also has a nice feature, this being the orange teeth like plastic on the top. This is designed to help clean the brush heads bristle. Just pull the bristled through the teeth and the excess dust/dirt will be pulled out, into the bucket/pan.It's as simple as that.The one negative, for me is that the metal pole doesn\u2019t feel as strong as some brushes I\u2019ve used and, I\u2019m guessing here, with a little too much pressure I can see this bending, or even snapping. But if you\u2019re careful then the pole should be fine.In all, a fine dust pan and crush which means you no longer have to bend down to pick up the debris from the floor. Ideal for those people with bad backs \u2026 or just lazy when it comes to brushing up, like myself.",
