The dustpan is also well-designed, with a deep and wide collection area that makes it easy to sweep up even large piles of dirt and debris.Another great feature of this sweep set is its compact and lightweight design. The broom and dustpan can be easily disassembled for storage or transport, and they don't take up much space.
