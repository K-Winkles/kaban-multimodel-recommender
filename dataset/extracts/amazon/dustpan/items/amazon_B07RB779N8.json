Not wide enough to cover your broomed up pile and not designed to fit into or hang together on the same hook as the brush! You have to hang them separately. Plus, it is cheap plastic; just a poorly made dustpan. The brush is significantly better than the plastic bristle type, and should be sold on its own, if the company can't design a better duo. Expected more from a Swiss product.",

Would definitely recommend and can't understand why there would be anything negative to say about this set.",
