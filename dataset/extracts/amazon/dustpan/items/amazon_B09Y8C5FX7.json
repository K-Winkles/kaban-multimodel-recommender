An American had moved to Bali and saw her cleaning lady use it on her bed and couch. Turns out it keeps them free from dust. Liked the idea and gave it a try and now I am loving using it as well! I bought a second one for furniture and window sills (in between polishing with a cloth) and got another for a gift. This would make a great stocking stuffer, part of a housewarming gift or for the person who thinks they already have everything :). Great quality at an affordable price.",
