It's a smaller sized broom who's bristles are strong enough to gather what a parrot can dish out, the dustpan's teeth takes out fur easily, it stands upright on its own, and it's a beautiful color. For people complaining about it coming loose, when you build it you can use teflon tape wrapped around the threads when you screw it together, and that will keep it from doing that.This is a sturdy set. I think the dustpan could have been slightly smaller in width, matching the broom, but that's fine. I didn't want a heavy large broom and dustpan. I have arthritis and lupus, so I needed something light. This is helping me tremendously. Also, the little matching dustpan set they included is perfect for the table where I draw, getting the mess from erasers and charcoal pencils. I was grateful it matched the broom set, with it's pretty green/blue color. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I highly recommend.",
