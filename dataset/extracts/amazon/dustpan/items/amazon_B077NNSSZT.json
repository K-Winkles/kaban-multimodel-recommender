I have a real mental block around getting it out of the closet. Having this handy little sweep has done wonders for keeping my floors less grimy, or taking car of small messes (dry ingredients only, mind you.) That said, I was very sad to see that the dust pan cracked shortly after purchase, for no discernible reason. I'm not doing any extreme sweeping here; what gives? Given that, it's a great little tool, but I'm not sure that I would repurchase the same brand and model again.",
