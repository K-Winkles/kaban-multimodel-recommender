                "reviewText": "This little dustpan is the perfect size for cleaning ashes from my Fireplace Extraordinaire. I needed something that fits between the legs of the grating at the front, so I chose this almost purely for its size.I like that it is stainless steel, but it would be useless for anything heavier than ashes. The metal is thin and mine came with a little bend in one edge. The worst part is the handle. It is welded on in a few small places, and would easily bend away from the body of the dustpan if not used carefully. In addition, the handle is awkward and uncomfortable to hold. The edges feel almost sharp and it does not fit well in your hand. I have wrapped the handle with some cloth tape, and plan to find a silicon cover (like those for cast iron skillets) to slide over the handle and make it easier to use. I need it daily for 4 months of the winter so I'll be interested to see how long it hold up.",
