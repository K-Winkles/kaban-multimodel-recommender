Appears built for everyday professional use.Assembly was a bit challenging but the picture on the box was very helpful. More so than the instructions.It has a little tab that can lock it. I was not aware until I accidentally locked it. So be mindful it is not stuck if this happens and be gentle when prying it back open. Lifting the plastic to clear the tab seems like a good idea to avoid breakage. But perhaps it can handle brute force?It stands well both open and closed and won't tip over unless pushed.",

When I close it the feathers stay inside and there are no cracks or holes they can fly out of. My only complaint is it locks open and it can be difficult to close when I need it to. I will sometimes drop things out of the dustbin just trying to get it to close.",

It takes ALOT of force to bend it into storage mode. AND THE DUST PAN IS NOT FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR. Dirt goes underneath of it, requiring 4-5-6-7 tries before you get the dirt in the pan. This broom and pan would best be suited for outdoors and large debris. Not fine dirt and junk indoors. That is all.",
