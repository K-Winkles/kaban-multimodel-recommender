            "Perfect Broom & Dustpan Combo - Professional grade full-sized broom & dustpan set for convenient sweeping at home & commercial use. Easy to assemble & very reliable. Being a real space saver, the broom fits firmly inside the dustpan & clips to handle for an easy stand-up and storage. 6 layers of soft, dense & flexible bristles effectively grab dust & dirt. The 36'' handle is a perfect length",
            "Self Cleaning Comb Design - Sturdy teeth at the top of the dustpan comb the broom, when it collects hair/dust/lint which usually gets tangled into the bristles. Otherwise, you would need to remove them manually - not the most pleasant experience. The dustpan has a rubber lip and seamlessly sticks to the floor. It picks up everything, including the smallest particles, in the first swoop, so you will finally spend less time cleaning - more time living!",
            "Efficient Cleaning: The butler broom and dustpan set is designed to efficiently clean up any messes, large or small, ensuring your floors are spotless with minimal effort.",

Ergonomic Design: The broom and dustpan have an ergonomic design that ensures comfortable use for extended periods. The broom handle is long enough to accommodate users of different heights, reducing back strain.",
            "Versatile: The butler broom and dustpan set is versatile enough to be used on different types of floors, including hardwood, tile, and carpet. The broom bristles are gentle enough to not scratch hardwood floors."

The rubber strip at the end of the dustpan is so strong that I can actually use it to scoop the shavings out, and it even gets the areas that are more clumped and stuck to the bottom of the cage; and the dustpan catches the dirt extremely well, too. The mini broom is sturdy enough to get even the littlest pieces of hay/food swept up.It's a bit more costly than some of the cheaper ones I found, but the quality is worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "This product is so extremely disappointing. I was so excited to receive my new broom and dustpan for my new apartment, but when I used it for the first time, I realized the dustpan does not sit flush with the floor. The rubber edge of the pan is not straight or flat, and all of the dust flies underneath, making it a pointless effort. I have to go around with my tiny hand brush and dustpan and sweep with that on my hands and knees because this thing is so terrible. The broom is pretty thin and sad as well. It really got tested when my daughter accidentally knocked over a mirror the other day, there were tiny glass shards everywhere, and you\u2019d think that your dustpan should help remedy this situation but no no not this one, it made the situation even worse. Glass pieces were going in all the wrong places and getting stuck in the weird frayed tips of the broom. I would love to get my money back for this purchase, but unfortunately upon arrival, I was so excited to get the product that I threw out the packaging, not knowing what lie ahead. Anyway, hope this helps someone make their decision. I was going to get a more bespoke looking wooden (and expensive) set but decided to try this instead. Big mistake. Learn from my mistakes and get the good one.",
