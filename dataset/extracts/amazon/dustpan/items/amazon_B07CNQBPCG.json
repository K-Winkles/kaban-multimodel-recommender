The broom is very dense with bristles & it picks up everything; and the pan really does work to quickly clean the bristles & empty the dirt into the pan. Frankly I like it more than the vacuum cleaner cuz much less hassle to use. In fact we bought a second one \u2014 for the garage & outside. It\u2019s well-made & packaged. Definitely worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Broom and Dustpan Combo, and while it was a decent product overall, I had one major issue with it. The broom was not wide enough to effectively sweep large areas.On the positive side, the broom and dustpan combo was easy to use and assemble. The broom had sturdy bristles that effectively swept up dirt and debris, and the dustpan had a rubber lip that prevented dust and dirt from escaping. Additionally, the set was compact and easy to store, making it a great option for small spaces.However, I found the narrow width of the broom to be a significant drawback. When sweeping large areas, I had to make several passes to cover the same ground, which was time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, the broom handle was a bit shorter than I would have preferred, which made it somewhat uncomfortable to use for extended periods.Overall, while I found the Broom and Dustpan Combo to be a decent product, the narrow width of the broom was a significant drawback. If you have a small space and only need to sweep up small areas, this product may work well for you. However, if you have a larger space to clean, you may want to consider a wider broom or a different product altogether",

                "reviewText": "It was time that common household items were improved. I had a broom with vinyl bristles where the bristles fanned out and didn't sweep well anymore. The bristles on this broom get into the corners of my kitchen cupboards well, as well as being close enough together to get the fine dirt. And the handle on the dustpan is long enough for the user to remain standing as the dirt is swept into the dustpan. The dustpan has teeth on the top edge to pull off any hair or threads from the bristles when necessary, and the dustpan is easy to empty into a wastebasket. The broom and dustpan can be clamped together which makes it easy to find them. And the dustpan can be made to hang flat in a broom closet. Both are lightweight and sturdy. I highly recommend them.",
