                "reviewText": "This broom and dustpan set is cute, but it\u2019s a bit challenging to use. The set is lightweight and is made from plastic. It comes with a hook that\u2019s easy to install. It has an adhesion that\u2019s pretty strong. The hook is deep and makes it hard to remove the set from the wall. The broom is a tad bit hard to remove from the holding area. I got this for my children to use. My daughter was struggling to remove the broom as well. Also, a tiny bit of the orange paint was missing from the beak of the birds face. The broom set is on the small side and is suitable for small jobs.*Update*The adhesiveness of the hook no longer sticks to the wall. It has only been about 3 or 4 days and it fell off the wall and won\u2019t stay up after being placed back. That is a bit surprising and disappointing because the adhesion was pretty strong at first. It just doesn\u2019t last.",

It comes with a hanging hook and I love how the brush slots into the pan when not in use.It\u2019s well worth \u00a34.59 at the time of review and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it.",
