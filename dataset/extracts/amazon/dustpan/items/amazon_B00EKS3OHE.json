Stiff but not brittle with a rubber edge on the floor end to keep the dust from escaping under the dustpan. Shaped to fit securely on the broom handle, where ever you want to place it. I leave it just high enough that it's off the broom's bristles to allow me to sweep the floor, then it's right where it should be when I snap it off the broom to pick up the sweepings. None of the fine dust sticks to the pan when you dump it, just good O-Cedar quality.",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with this dustpan. It very securely snaps onto my broom handle and does not move or spin after attachment. It is truly anti static. It is actually fun to watch the dirt and dust just flow into the wastebasket, leaving the dustpan all clean! I have never had that happen before. I always had to bang previous dustpans on the side of wastebasket to get the \"clinging\" dust and dirt to drop off. I had to show my hubby how cool it was. So far the rubber along the edge does block dirt from sliding under while sweeping up dust/dirt piles. I hope that part holds up. Time will tell. OH! almost forgot, the rubber block of \"teeth\" to knock fuzz balls off the bottom of broom works great also! I just could not be happier with this dustpan. :-) Needless to say, the last one I bought (different brand) was NOT so great. I happily gave that piece of junk to my hubby to use in the garage!",

Less clumsy people will be able to keep the dustpan steady and level.The dustpan handle enthusiastically snaps onto and grips the short Quickie-brand \"lobby broom\" used in hotels and restaurants to tidy up discreetly.It's good, but I'm picky--this is the third dustpan I've tried in as many years.",
