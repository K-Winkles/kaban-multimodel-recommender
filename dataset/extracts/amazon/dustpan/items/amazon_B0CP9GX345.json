The wooden grip shape and size is very comfortable while the brush sweeps up everything easily, including fine matter. The pan even has teeth to clean the brush! The size if the pan is wide enough to catch a lot of material. This combo went straight into my garage along with my other tools of the trade.",

They are convenient for small messes and help scrape them up with little dust remaining.The only complaint is that we haven't figured out a good way to hang/store this item. If we position it as shown in the photo, it will hang nicely on a 2 inch straight peg; however, we don't have a 2 inch straight peg near where we would like to keep it. If we position it as shown and then try to hang it with the strap, it doesn't hold in place. If we turn the brush so it sticks out it will (barely) click into place and hold there; then we can hand it by the strap as long as we are very careful not to bump it (in which case the pan falls off). The way we usually hang it is by putting the pan over a simple hook and looping the brush strap around the pan handle. This looks awkward, but keeps it securely hung where we want it.",

The bristles are not quite stiff enough to really sweep dirt and debris into the dustpan. I feel like it takes extra effort to sweep it all into the dustpan (more than it should). I will get some use out of this set, but will probably need to find another brush with stiffer bristles to do a better job.",

                "reviewText": "This is a small pan with a brush that fits into the curved handle. The brush is thick and soft with a wooden handle that\u2019s easy to hold on to even if my hands are wet. This set is small enough to store easily. It\u2019s easy to grab this set to clean up messes in my craft room or wherever I drop stuff.The pan has a good soft rubber on the flat scoop area which makes it easy to get everything into the pan instead of having dirt slide under it.There\u2019s a loop on the top of the brush handle if you want to hang it up. If you push the dustpan down onto the handle, the design allows the pan to grip the handle and stay in place. The pan has a hole in it in case you want to hang it separately. The set even comes with a stick on hook to hang it from.It\u2019s a utilitarian item I like having around for quick clean-up jobs. I\u2019m pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this dust pan and fox tail, the foxtail is solid and looks great. The wood handle looks attractive and is solid, the chrome shaft that connects the handle to the brush head is nice looking and sturdy too. The bristles are stiff and allows you to get in any grooves your floor may have.The dust pan is firm and solid too and has a wide enough front to the pan for general household use.My one and only complaint is the rubber front of the pan is to rounded and makes getting all of the dirt/dust into the pan. The lip may soften and flatten out overtime but as is you have to brush hard and at an angle to get every little piece of dirt up. I am not going to take a star off for that little detail.This pan and brush look and feel like they will last much longer than all the other house hold ones I have had.Next to the shop dustpans and foxtails that I have had this is the best and at the best price by far.",

                "reviewText": "i don't like using a broom with a dust pan. I just can't stand that line it makes when it does not pick up everything and then I still have dirt on the floor. But this dustpan as a rubber bar that remove the problem completely. The little whisk broom is made of good quality and worked well. It was packaged well and came with a hook to put on a wall or flat surface. Only design flaw was the little hole in the dust pan making people think you are supposed to hang it by itself. But when you try to but the broom back on it, it does not fit well. So what you are really supposed to do is to attack the broom to the dust pan and use the loop in the handle of the broom to hang it. It was packaged well and arrived quickly. Awesome.",

                "reviewText": "If you're in the market for a lightweight dustpan and brush this should work well for you. It might not hold up for years and years but it's a dustpan, right? You can't really go wrong with something like this. I use it for my RV since it's really light and seems fairly durable. The brush is fine weave and so it brushes up everything from dust and sand to something like leaves. One really nice feature is, if you notice, the brush is angled so it's easier to use than it would be if it wasn't. That a nice feature that I'm glad the manufacturer got right. I also like the fact that the dustpan is larger and so can pick up more. This was a great find for what I needed.",

                "reviewText": "This dustpan and brush set is great! It's well-made and sturdy. The handle of the brush is made with nice materials and has a nice leather-like strap for hanging. The bristles are just right - not too stiff and not too soft! The flex well, which means you can get into tight spaces (like under kitchen cabinets). They catch even small crumbs. This set also comes with a clear, self-adhesive hook, which is a nice feature!The rubber edge of the dustpan is great because it flexes to stay flush with the floor's surface so that it catches all of the dirt you sweep into it! The large size of the pan is great because it can hold a lot before needing to be dumped.The reason why I deducted a star, was that the dustpan handle/top does not hold the handle of the brush very tightly when you put them together. However, it does have a hole for hanging, so I suppose you can hang them separately. I would have preferred if it had some kind of grip or a way to snap them together.Overall, I'm very happy with this set! I am very picky when it comes to dustpans and brushes, because I've had so many crapy, junky ones...But this set is great!",
