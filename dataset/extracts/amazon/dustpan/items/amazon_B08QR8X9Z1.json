They are also good at collecting hair from humans and pets. The adjustable broom head allows you to sweep under furniture with a low clearance. The dust pan has a long handle so you don't have to bend over and the teeth on the dust pan clean hair and dust bunnies off the broom. The handles on the broom and dust pan are interchangeable, and I prefer the longer handle on the broom.The only thing I would change, is that the manual actually explain how to attach the handles and that they can be changed depending on your preference. Other than that, I like this product. I think its perfect for indoor use.",
