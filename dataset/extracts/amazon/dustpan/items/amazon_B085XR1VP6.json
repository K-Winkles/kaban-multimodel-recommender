                "reviewText": "I'm an adult without kids who loves common household items shaped like animals, and this set actually really comes in handy. I break it out for small tasks that don't require a full-sized broom, so it basically took the place of my chunky handheld brush. In fact, it's more effective in corners and along the baseboards of my walls because the bristles are longer and more flexible. The handle of the mini-broom comes up to my knees, which is still quite compact but allows me to get under things like couches and cabinets easily with less bending over.There are a couple quality issues. The dust pan is slightly misshapen, so it doesn't lay totally flat on the floor. I have to press down during use to make sure crumbs don't just fly underneath. A chunk of the bristles on one side were in disarray when it arrived too, meaning they stick out farther than the rest.However, these are the same flaws I've seen with grown-up versions that are made of cheap plastic in this price range, and I love having a small dust pan that stands up on its own. Due to the hump in the front, debris stays inside very securely when I walk around with it, which is nice too! It's a pretty great cleaning tool for something that's technically a toy, and the set brightens my day simply because it's so cute.",

You\u2019re worth this cute silly tool to help stay tidy!Bought for adhd-like brain to keep in a bedroom to tidy in small bursts. I sometimes sweep just to \u201cplay\u201d with the pink bear broom. It stands up on its own and doesn\u2019t topple when cats rub against it. I love having this little broom so I don\u2019t have to walk all the way to the kitchen to grab the big broom and risk distraction from the task at hand (a tip from KC Davis of StruggleCare). Great for the gloomy winter months when cleaning motivation is low. Would buy again!",
