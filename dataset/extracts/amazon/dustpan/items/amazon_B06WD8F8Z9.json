I went ahead with this dustpan, as it looked sturdy, and had the large size I wanted. I was happy when I got it. The construction is solid, the finish is good, and the handle has a comfortable foam grip. The handle also seems like it will be fine over the years as the foam either hardens or falls off. I expect this dustpan will last years, and be fully-functional all the time. It's a dustpan, so there is a limit to how excited I can get, but really, this was all that I asked for and more.",
