The broom and dustpan are good quality. The only negative I have noticed is it would've been better if the broom bristles were angled so corners could be reached more easily. Other than that, it's perfect!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to clean up eraser crumbs while drawing. The sturdy bristles are great for cookie crumbs but are too well spaced for the fine eraser crumbs so I just use a large clean paint brush for the eraser crumbs. The dustpan has a great rubber edge that can flex to snug to the surface you are cleaning and catches the eraser crumbs easily, however my eraser crumbs cling to it and I have to sweep them off into the trash with a paint brush. Still, it's great for cookie crumbs that fall when I snack while drawing.",
