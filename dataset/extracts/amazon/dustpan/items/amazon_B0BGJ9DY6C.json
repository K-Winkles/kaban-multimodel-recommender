                "reviewText": "I'm so happy, you have no idea. I have been searching for some time, for a decent dust pan and brush. The one that I had drove me absolutely insane. The bristles on it were too hard, and the pan itself was pure garbage. This new dust pan and brush, are fantastic by contrast. So important to a dust pan, is the rubber lip which makes contact with the floor, and this one has that, and works extremely well. I like that the bristles on the brush are nice and soft, because it makes it easier to pick up both coarse and fine particles. Not that it really matters, but it is an attractive looking set as well. Most importantly, it works extremely well, and I couldn't be happier about it. It's strange that little things in life, oftentimes make big differences, and as stupid as it sounds, a good dust pan and brush, are a necessity for maintaining one's home. I do recommend this brush, and pan.",

                "reviewText": "It's a dustpan, what do you need to know? The colors are good with gray and natural wood. The bristles aren't too soft and not too firm, and they work well to sweep up most messes. I like that there is a bit of rope in the handle of the brush to hang on a wall. Most importantly, it's not a goofy gaudy color so I don't mind it hanging around my kitchen.",

This dustpan makes it a lot easier: it's really sturdy and well-made, and the brush works super well and doesn't leave much behind or stuck in the crack between the pan and the floor. It's made moss clean-up faster and easier. I'd definitely recommend it.",

As it is, when I sweep cat litter into the pan, a good portion goes underneath. It takes a lot of brushing to get the daily cleaning around the litter box done. I bought two of these sets and they're both bothersome. It would have been better to spend a bit more money and save the time spent brushing litter around.",
