It was sturdy for the price and just what I needed to sweep up the cat litter that was tracked from the litter box to the floor. The recently purchased dustpan and brush are not work the 10$ and change I paid for them. The pan is so flimsy, it bends when I touch it to the floor to pick up the small particles of litter. It is also smaller than the 1# one that i purchased years earlier. SAVE YOUR MONEY. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!",
