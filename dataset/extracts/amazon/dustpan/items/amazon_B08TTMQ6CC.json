                "reviewText": "PROS: It is a good looking minimalist set, at least comparing to regular plastic ones. Personally, I like it's size because it is not bulky and fairly lightweight, I'm 5,6' and quite comfortable using it, but it's a matter of personal preference I think.CONS: It is cheaply made apart from the bamboo handle top. Plastic parts are flimsy. The broom is OK, but the bristles were a little tangled and misshaped so I don't think it will last. The dustpan is not good, it is slightly deformed so the pan is not flat and part of what you are trying to sweep into it always gets under. The handle cannot be fixated so you can't remedy that issue with right angle. Also the dustpan is heavy and inconvenient to empty. Honestly, the dustpan from dollar store performed better.CONCLUSION: doesn't worth the price",
