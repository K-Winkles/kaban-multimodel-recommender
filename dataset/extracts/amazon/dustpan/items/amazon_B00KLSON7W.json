It functions pretty well, I like that the dust pan has a nice easy lip to scoop up debris with, and it's deep and can hold a decent amount of dust. The only thing I've noticed is that it's a little hard to get nooks and crannies and sharp edges, specifically when I'm sweeping the stairs. There is a bit of a lip on the ends of the brush that hits the wall before the bristles do. No biggie, I just have to do a couple extra sweeps when I'm dusting.",

Nonetheless, I purchased the dustpan and not the ring, so here goes...Among brush and dustpan sets, this one is a standout. The brush has fine, dense, flexible bristles that conform to every surface and sweep really well. The pan is deep, with a soft rubber lip, and its top edges curve over to contain the dust inside. Brush your crumbs into a pile, and with one stroke, sweep the pile into the pan. No need to chase around that line of crumbs that usually remains by the lip of the dustpan - you know the one I mean.When you are done cleaning up, the bamboo brush fits into the handle of the dustpan, making a tidy and attractive package. It looks like it was designed with care - not mass-produced.Overall, it is the large, canary yellow diamond solitaire of dustpans.",

Made from sustainable bamboo and recycle plastic, who could ask for more!This didn't come with instructions so, for the benefit of those new to college life, I will supply mine, learned through much trial and error:(1) Remove brush by pulling out from convenient holder in handle.(2) Place dustpan (the flat bit) in front of the dust/dirt/small objects you want to pick up (Note: items should be dry for best results)(3) Hold handle of pan and tilt slightly(4) Now, holding the brush in your other hand by the handle place it on the far side of the dirt to be collected, bristle side down (this is important)(5) The arrangement should be pan - dirt - brush (bristles DOWN)(6) Apply just sufficient pressure to press the bristles slightly against the floor but still to allow you to draw the brush towards the dirt and the pan in one \"sweeping\" motion(7) Dirt should be \"swept\" into the pan(8) Carefully lift pan with dirt. Important tip: keep it horizontal (if you forget this simply go back to step 2, above)(9) Go to trash can and tilt the pan so that (most of) the dirt falls into can(10) Place brush back into handy holder.Congratulations, you've swept up something.",
