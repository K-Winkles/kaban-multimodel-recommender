I like the handle on the dustpan it also locks so now I don\u2019t have to pick up broom and dustpan from the floor. Oh and the broom is great to get in corners and for my floor lines it got more that what I have ever dust off, all that dirt trapped in small places.

                "reviewText": "I originally bought this for my RV because according to the dimensions, it would fit into the little closet I have. Upon arrival, I immediately assembled it and gave it a try. With 3 dogs, especially a Border Collie who sheds 24/7/365, I really wanted to try it out and I wanted it to work out. Holy cow, this won't even leave my house and now I am forced to buy another one. With rheumatoid arthritis, regular brooms, and dustpans are too much strain on my spine, hips and joints, however, this provides so much overall physical comfort, I am not complaining at all. I read all the negative reviews and if the label on it bothers you, soak it in warn water for 20 minutes and off it comes. I have had no problem getting everything swept up and disposed of. I use it every day to sweep tile and hardwood and it really works! The only thing that is a negative is I keep asking myself, \"Why did I wait so long to buy this?\"",
