                "reviewText": "I know it sounds wrong, but at first I was reluctant to get this set because I didn't like the aesthetics. It was too geometric and it didn't look minimalist. But, it has great reviews, so I tried it. I started using it right after taking it out of the package, and I liked it immediately!!!! The first thing I noticed was that the handle is genius and thoughtful, which I now think should be the standard model for all dustpans, or at least the smaller ones. The thickness of the bamboo was comfortable, and the round shape really did surprisingly give a \"unidirectional\" way to sweep, which made the sweeping/whisking a breeze!!! I was not expecting that, but glad to see it. I also used the bristles to get into the grooves at the edges between my linoleum floor and carpeted floors, and there was a spot between the linoleum and where a carpeted staircase began, and this little broom super dug out a bunch of lint which had accumulated there and was impervious to my other cleaning tools. I wasn't even trying to do a deep clean, but the bristles and the unidirectional handle made a quick job of deep cleaning the grooves!!! A regular sized and handled whisk broom could not have done that so well. Anyway, I'm super sold on this whisk broom and dustpan set now, and super glad for all of the good reviews which convinced me to give it a try!!! I highly recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "I use this to get coffee grounds off the counter. Works great. The brush doesn\u2019t snap into place in the pan handle but is snug enough not to just fall apart. The bristles wash well and don\u2019t stain from the coffee grounds. The pan lip is rubber so bends easily to get a clean swipe. Happy with my new little brush and pan",
