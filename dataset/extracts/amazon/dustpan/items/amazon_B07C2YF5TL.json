                "reviewText": "Glad I gave in and bought the dustpan. Although I originally thought $20 was a lot, I kept thinking about how it doesn't have to be emptied every time you sweep up a little bit. I have two cats whose mission in life is to make sure there is litter tracked around the house all day. Following them around with a broom and this dustpan is so much easier when you can just stand it in the corner until the end of the day and empty it once.",
