                "reviewText": "I copied another review. Same issue.Whoever made this dustpan applied one of those ultra-sticky gooey labels that is virtually impossible to remove, and put it EXACTLY where dust and dirt have to go. Tried to get the damn thing off and now it's a 2 x 3 inch patch of sticky goo which attracts and grabs dirt that can't even be brushed or rinsed off. Not a good way to prepare a product",

                "reviewText": "I was disappointed with this dustpan. I got it because my old Rubbermaid dustpans had worn-down edges from years of use. Were those made in the USA? This new one is crap next to them. We all know where it was probably made. It does not collect all the swept-up dust and debris as advertised. No matter how hard I tried, a line of stuff was left on the floor.",
