It's sturdy and easy to assemble and it has a satisfying click to the bin.One thing that can be improved, there is a small gap when putting it on the floor and it's impossible to pick up every single last crumb with it. Some sorta small rubber piece there would have been helpful.Another would've been nice to have is the spokes to clean the broom. The handle of the broom can also come apart but you just twist it back in place.",
