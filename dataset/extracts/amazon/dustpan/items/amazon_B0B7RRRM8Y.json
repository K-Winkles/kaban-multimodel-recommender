But this one does not have a rubber lip. It is the solid material that the bin is made of. Which makes it so easy to sweep the material in the bin. Just put my foot up against the back of the bin, sweep and it\u2019s in. I\u2019m tall and the handle is nice and long. You can attach the broom and dustpan handle to each other and either stand them together with the bin flat on the floor or easily fold the bin up and stand it that way. The broom is made of a great material so it picks up all the dust bunnies and litter with ease. And the comb on the dustbin for those dust bunnies works perfectly the first time. The handles are made of a sturdy material and so easy to put together. Just a great quality item and company.",

I live alone with my cat and she\u2019s always shedding so those teeth on the dust pan really make a difference. It removes all that build up on the broom. I also really like that the height can be adjusted I think it\u2019s really simple. You just put the poles together for the desired height and start cleaning! Storage is really straightforward as well. The dustpan has a little clip that you put the broom on and then the whole thing just folds up. I\u2019d definitely recommend this product.

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars As I suspected",
                "reviewText": "Three CONS but I'd already suspected it may have them when I bought the product so I'm fine with it. Also please keep in mind that the competitors are apt to have the same problems for the same reason.1. The entire unit does not easily close up without having to use your hands. It's do-able but takes a midge of time and effort. I'm lazy so am just keeping it open. The pan does go into the vertical position well enough but the lid takes a bit of work to get in place. Maybe the lid would work better if it was made out of metal (stiffer and heavier) than out of plastic.2. The bristles on the outside of the broom do not stay neatly in the pan when stored in the vertical position. They end up squished like a hairdo badly in need of a bcombing. Again, I'm simply keeping the pan open. The bristles get pushed out of place by the sides of the pan. I suspect that eventually this will mess up the broom bristles themselves. the pan needs to be a midge wider in relation to the width of the broom bristles in order for this not to happen. Only time will tell.3. The bristles of the broom are VERY soft and pliable. I'm used to and prefer a stiffer non-plastic type of broom (with the fuzzy edges that trap the dust bunnies). This means that I have to adjust my stroke style from the one I've been using for years. Too much pressure down on the broom flings the dirt when I let go. I need to do shorter, gentler strokes when using this broom. Too much pressure down on the broom also spreads the hairs apart so that smaller pieces of dirt is missed. See the PROS for having such soft bristles though. An option for a stiffer bristled broom would have been welcome.Here are the PROS about the product.1. It is light.2. It is very easy to put together.3. It has a tall handle both on the pan and the broom. (This is the main reason I bought this unit.)4. The broom handle easily clicks in place for storage to the pan handle.5. The PRO part to having the flimsy hairs on the broom is that it works great with the \"comb\" to get dust bunnies off of the broom. No more pulling that stuff off by hand.6. It seems sturdy enough. I've not put it through it's paces for a time yet so don't know for sure.7. Nice clean simple look without a bunch of different colors, pictures, logos, etc.8. Nice deep pan but easy to dump out.9. For those of you who don't have the vertical space to store such a tall item, the poles do come apart.Synopsis:I did get this particular model instead of other models due to the lid. Don't bother. The lid does not close at all well. BUT getting this model for the tall poles, deep pan, and the \"comb\" that you can get the dust bunnies off with is well worth it. The broom bristles themselves are way too flimsy for me but that's a matter of preference. The stiffer bristles that I prefer would not do as well with the \"comb\". As for how well it catches the dirt as I sweep, I think I just need to adjust my sweeping style to less pressure and smaller strokes. You need to decide which is more important to you.",

I love that it has the bristle combs for hair buildup, but my favorite part is that it\u2019s stands upright (very sturdy so it does not fall easily). It perfectly slides between my W/D out of sight and upright. It\u2019s light, sturdy, compact, and gets the job done. Buy it!",
