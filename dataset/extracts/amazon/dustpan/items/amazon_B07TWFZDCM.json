                "reviewText": "I purchased these for my students to help with cleanup after snack. They are super light, easy for little ones to hold and use, are in bright colors they like, and seem pretty sturdy for daily use. These are just the perfect size for them to clean up small spills (while developing independence skill), and helps them easily store the mini sweep broom and dustpan together because they nest perfectly into one another. The mini dustpan set is easily stored on hooks in our snack area and because it has larger hanging loop opening in the handles, it is easy for children to take down and hang back up easily. Having 2 of each color in this set of 6 makes it easy for friends to share, and get the color they like when they want to help. I am very happy with this set and my students love it too. Works great!",

Cloths appear to be a soft microfiber material.My only complaint, is the amount of plastic. Each cloth is individually wrapped and then placed in a larger plastic bag. Each broom is also individually wrapped, and everything is placed in a larger zip plastic bag. Then it's mailed in a plastic mailer. I usually am not uptight about plastic but this seems extreme to me.",
