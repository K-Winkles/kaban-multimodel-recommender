Anyway, I was so impressed with this thing that I started using it downstairs in the kitchen. It's great for cleaning up those crumbs and stuff that gets generated when eating food. It's a handy little unit to have around. I actually leave this out tucked on the side of the counter in the kitchen. Most people don't even know what it is and ask. Typical oxo quality. The thing is well designed and well implemented. If this word is self-destruct, which it probably won't, I would replace it with another. It's just one of those things you don't think you really need until you get it and then you realize how valuable it is",

                "reviewText": "EPA cleaned up our home/property a year or so ago. And they had a major contamination accident while doing so. They panic'd and ended up taking one of two of my no longer made dust pans and brush sets. Actually just the pan and it was quite unique in our sewing room. So that really irked me...and I've looked before then and definitely since. I do find something similar to that flat set that was just so superior to anything ever. But meantime I've contemplated this set numerous times since seeing it here on Amazon a few years ago. And so decided to order 2. One for camping and one for sewing room replacement. We had another but hubby made off with that one. Very coveted items the orginal rubbermaid model..almost full size dustpan with flat full size hand broom. Similar items are small short brooms more like this. I orginally bought to use at work in seed world. People would covet them so much they would sit on them and not share. I finally brought them home before they were gone. And we tried to buy more then but when we found we bought the only two in store that was going out of business and never found another. That's been close to 20 plus years ago. They held up remarkablly well too. So what I like about this so far. This brooms little cup dust bin is a nice size and fairly easy to brush into. It's definitely easy to empty into a trash can even with a small opening such as along a desk or sewing room might have. The brush is quite sturdy with multiple rows of firm brushes that look like they well hold up over time too. So even if it doesn't work out as a full replacement I'm positive I'll find some good spots to keep it handy and it'll get used. No we didn't complain loudly to the EPA...as they could have barred us from our home for EVER. We thought we'd best let them save face and get back into the house and well really EPA does not always have your best interest at heart like these folks like to tell you. Man is that a misconception. The OXO broom does have your best interest at heart.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE THIS SET! It is the perfect size for keeping the work spaces tidy in my craft room. It's perfect for collecting threads and clippings in my sewing area. It's even more handy at sweeping up things like eraser poop and those tiny trimmings that seem to multiply while scrapbooking and doing other crafty things. I've had mine for several years and I'm coming back to get another one for my husband so he will quit stealing mine to use in the garage. The only change I would like to see is a different color so I can tell in a blink if he has mine (again).The flexible edge makes quick work of getting the debris into the \"pan\". And the pan makes a perfect holder for the brush when it isn't being used. For me, the best part of this set over other similar tools is it's size and the way the bristles DO NOT hang onto finer particles. Those \"cling-ons\" that are attracted to brooms of all sizes is the bane of my existence! They are securely stuck to the bottom of the broom and release themselves only when you WANT them to stay on a moment longer- like when you are headed to the nearest trash can.",

El cepillo tiene las cerdas muy tupidas y recogen muy bien la suciedad. Su dureza es la justa para recoger bien todo y limpiar, pero sin ara\u00f1ar ni da\u00f1ar las superficies. Es muy peque\u00f1ito por lo que se puede guardar f\u00e1cilmente en cualquier rinc\u00f3n. El compartimento donde se ponen las migas es perfecto porque tiene una goma en el filo y se introducen muy bien hasta las part\u00edculas m\u00e1s finas. Tiene como dos pesta\u00f1as a los lados para que el cepillo quiere bien sujeto y no se mueva ni se caiga. Est\u00e9ticamente es muy mono por su reducido6s tama\u00f1o y por su originalidad. Estoy contenta con su compra y lo recomiendo. Es un artilugio m\u00e1s de la cocina para hacerte la vida un poco m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y agradable.",
