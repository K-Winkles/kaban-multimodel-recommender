                "reviewText": "So, the description says 2 pack. That means two sets of broom and dustpan. Ok, my mistake. My other mistake, the broom is short. I'm short, and it's too short for me. I know it's in the description, and this is why we don't shop tired, m'kay? They are sturdy, though. We put one on the back porch for leaves and whatever, the other is inside because I like the dustpan and I just ordered a broom with a longer handle.I like that the broom attaches to the handle of the dustpan and stores slim, I'm hoping the broom I just ordered fits that nicely but if not, that's ok, because I love the dustpan.",
