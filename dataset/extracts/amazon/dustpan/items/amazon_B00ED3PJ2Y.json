                "reviewText": "This is the best dust pan u can ever own. It is the dust pan of all dust pans. It is sturdy, It is flat along the edge making it easy to get all the dust or what ever u are sweeping into it cleaned up. I have had mine since 2021 and I am buying 2 more because I need them in different areas of my home. My dog even chewed the handle of the one I bought in 2021 and it is still THE BEST DUST PAN !",
