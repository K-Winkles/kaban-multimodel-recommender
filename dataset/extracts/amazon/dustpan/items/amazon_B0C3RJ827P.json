                "reviewText": "One of the standout features of this set is the long handle broom. With a 48\" long handle, it allows me to sweep comfortably without bending over, reducing strain on my back. The stainless steel pole adds durability and rust-resistance to the broom, ensuring it withstands regular use. The 22 mm diameter detachable pole is easy to assemble, making it convenient to set up and use.Efficiency is key when it comes to cleaning, and this set delivers on that front. The widened broom head is equipped with high-quality and heavy-duty 4-layer bristles, making it highly effective in cleaning large areas and corners. The 180\u00b0 rotation capability of the broom head allows it to reach deep into the bottom of furniture and corners, capturing dust and dirt with ease. This feature saves me valuable time and ensures a thorough cleaning experience.The self-cleaning dustpan is another highlight of this set. It is designed with built-in combs that easily scrape debris from the broom bristles into the dustpan, eliminating the need for manual cleaning. The dustpan's lip fits seamlessly with the ground, preventing dust leakage while sweeping. The ergonomic handle of the dustpan adds to the comfort and ease of use during cleaning sessions.Lastly, I would like to mention the assembly process and the lightweight nature of this set. The broom and dustpan are easy to assemble, requiring no complicated steps or tools. The lightweight construction makes it effortless to maneuver and carry around the house, enabling efficient cleaning without causing strain or fatigue.",

Continue your search on Amazon or elsewhere!!!\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8I bought this broom because I have two \ud83d\udc08 \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b & a \ud83d\udc15 in a 900 Sq Ft two bedroom apartment. The rooms have carpet but the rest is hard floors! Great a cool broom to sweep up cat hair with a cool dustpan to help keep the bristles clean of cat hair. SWEET!!!!NOT SO SWEET!!! The bristles are soooooo fine you can barely sweep anything!!! Took me like five mins just to sweep one corner of cat hair and cat food crumbs\ud83d\ude11 better off vacuuming with my Shark Rocket Ultra!This broom is straight buffoonery and definitely NOT worth $25. NOT EVEN WORTH $17 on sale\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11In your hand the broom feels like it\u2019s gonna fall apart.WHATEVER YOU DO!!! If you own this broom\u2026. Do NOT! I repeat DO NOT try and use this broom as a defense mechanism. A raccoon can snatch this light flimsy broom from your hands\ud83d\ude29My broom is back in its box ready to be dropped off at Amazon Fresh!!! And I\u2019m back to using my LIBMAN broom that I done had for eight years and it STILL does a better job then this cheaply made brand new broom\ud83d\ude11",
