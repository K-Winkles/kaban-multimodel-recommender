                "reviewText": "Leave blowers are a metaphor for everything wrong with our society.At some point, it became perfectly ok to blow your trash into the sidewalk or street so that the wind can carry it down to your neighbor's house and end up on his/her lawn. It happened when we weren't looking...and now, you all you see are dozens of yard maintenance crews driving around blowing leaves around with their gas-guzzling leave blowers. (I secretly think that they laugh at the idiocy of one person paying them money to blow leaves into another person's yard, just to have THAT person turn around and pay them to blow leaves into yet ANOTHER person's yard.)Needless to say, I still take care of the leaves in my yard the old fashioned way...with a shovel and lawn bags. This dust pan is large/sturdy enough for me to scoop up massive piles of leaves to deposit into my over-sized lawn bags saving me some time.I suppose you could use this for picking up dust in your home, but to be honest...if you need a dustpan that's this big for your home you might see if you can get a spot on Hoarders.",

Its kind of weird designed thus way. The lip makes a pretty good seal with the floor do most if the dirt gets swept in. Not perfect to get all the first but better than others i have used. It is also iversized so note the dimensions before you buy. I also purchased a Libyan broom that \"Snaps on\". It is a tight fit.",
