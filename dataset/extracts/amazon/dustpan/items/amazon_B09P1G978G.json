They\u2019re actually better than my normal size dustpan!!I did notice some stray bristles when I first opened them, so I stood over the trash can and just fanned them out, it wasn\u2019t many at all. And that was it they haven\u2019t shed a bristle since, and they\u2019re used multiple times a day. They\u2019re really full bodied without the big gaps in between like most small whisk broom sets that I\u2019ve used in the past.Great little sets at a really good price, for lots of uses around the house, and I\u2019m going to stick a set under my car seat as well. I\u2019m very pleased with my purchase & big Kudos to the company & seller!! Thank you!!\ud83d\ude0a",

The bristles are just flexible enough to pick up spilled flour and sturdy enough to be used in my potting area for spilled potting soil. I even used the outdoor one to pick up gravel once.The rubber lip on the dustpan helps to catch everything in the first swipe. There are even little teeth sculpted into one shoulder of the dustpan to help scrape sticky soil from the brush right into the pan. The brush itself is at the perfect angle for sweeping up small spills.Somebody really thought this one through!And, my goodness, the price is certainly right!I want to add that I really appreciate the reviewers who came before me to help find the perfect little \"butler's helper.\"",

I decided to step up and as these came us in a group of four it seemed appropriate. They are much better made than the dollar store ones I bought and I know they will last longer. I will keep buying these as needed.",
