        "description": "Keep your home clean and tidy with the Casabella Wayclean Handheld Angled Brush and Dustpan Set. This cleaning set includes an angled brush and coordinating dustpan for an all-in-one sweeping solution. The brush features a pointed tip designed to easily reach into corners, cracks, and other hard-to-reach areas that would be difficult to clean with a regular broom, while the rubber bumpers along the sides of the brush prevent it from scuffing or scratching the wall. The dustpan is designed with a built-in comb for cleaning dust off the brush, and the soft rubber lip lies flat against the floor to maximize pick up. The soft-grip handled brush provides comfort and ergonomic use, and it fits securely into the dustpan for convenience. This medium-sized hand broom set measures 14\" x 9\" x 4\" total for efficient storage in cabinets, drawers, and closets when not in use. Casabella was created with the novel idea that housewares and cleaning products could be great looking, fun and functional all at the same time. With focus on product and graphic design we strive to deliver products that are attractive, intuitive and supremely functional.",

                "reviewText": "The size is hard to understand from Amazon. Of dustpans I\u2019ve seen in my life, this one is almost exactly in the middle size-wise, which imo is perfect. Fwiw it probably a bit too small to use comfortably with a standard floor broom, but I have broom pans for that, dustpan is supplemental and I don\u2019t want it to be large.Quality & design is excellent. They clearly put some thought into how the product is used.The Pan: silicone \u2018lip\u2019 at the leading edge is nice and pliable so dirt does not get underneath when sweeping on a slightly non-flat surface. Quality feels fine. Its a plastic injection molded polypropylene piece with a matte finish on the outside, glossy on the inside. It also has little nubs on the bottom of the back so it won\u2019t grind dirt and sand into my wood floor while using it.The brush: feels great in hand, great weight to it, over-molded grip feels good and is secure. Unsure what it is made out of, I think all the proof marks are under the over-mold or among the bristles. Feels different than the pan, and the mold itself shows a bit more wear vs. the Pan\u2019s mold. Nothing I would call a defect and overall its up there with the best in the category. The handle isn\u2019t bulbous or round like Oxo tends to do for handles so if you have really bad arthritis it might not be ideal for you. The bristles are a little stiff because its new so it can fling dirt if you\u2019re not careful. I think this will fix itself over time as most brooms do.I typically stick to Oxo for products like this but I don\u2019t like their dustpan design. This Casabella branded model could easily be Oxo branded and I wouldn\u2019t question it (other than lacking the characteristic Oxo-bulbous handle + Oxo colorway).Happy with it, best dustpan of the 5 or so I\u2019ve owned to-date. Thank you for attending my ted talk.",

                "reviewText": "There's something about the shape as well as the \"rubberized\" edges that make scooping up random spills, crumbs, et al. infinitely easier and more comfortable, as well as quicker and gathering more faster than any other dustpan we've had before. Plus this one is available in a few cool combos of colors (green or orange lining). Really happy with this one.",
