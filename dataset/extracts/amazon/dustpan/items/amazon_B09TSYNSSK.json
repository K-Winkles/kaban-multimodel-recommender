The handles are 1/2\" or 5/8\" wide, much too narrow to use easily. That said, the dustpan stands up as advertised and is reasonably sturdy for a lightweight set. It's all shiny metal. The broom head is really nice, although the bristles are quite soft. I imagine it would go for $10-$15 in a dollar store. With Amazon, it's always caveat emptor.",
