                "reviewText": "The broom and dustpan both work pretty darn well. They're a good size, too - small enough to be useful for tight spaces or small spills, but not comically small like others I've seen. I like that they even have a hair catcher on the dustpan. That's not something I've seen very commonly on smaller sets like this.Overall, it does exactly what it should, and it does it pretty well. The set is great, too - one for upstairs and one for downstairs. We're set!",

                "reviewText": "This dust pan set is good quality and seems very durable. It is a smaller than normal size but is not mini by no means. The brush has a silicone handle for a secure grip and has thick strong bristles that are very flexible. The dust pan is sturdy and has a flexible rubber edge to level it along the floor when sweeping dirt into the pan. A dust pan set always comes in handy especially the smaller sized ones like these and I find myself using them a lot even with handheld vacuums at my disposal. The bristles on the brush are heavy duty and would work great for even sweeping up sawdust and metal shavings, so it would work great in a workshop as well as in the house or for sweeping out a tent when camping. This is a great value for two sets of these and I recommend them to others.",

Overall an ok set for rough cleanup but not as good as I was expecting. I'll be looking for another one that has fine bristles for fine dust pickup. Still not a bad product for the price, good to keep around the kitchen/garage/RV for general spills or quick cleanup between vacuuming. 3 stars for quality and at full list price I think they are over priced.",

The pan is full-sized so it's made to pick-up big messes. The brush handle also has a sturdy loop so you can hang this in your utility closet.I always keep these kinds of portable dustpan with brush in the car. It's a staple to have and great for cleaning up messes like sand from the beach, Cheerios, and loose leaves and debris.The pack of two makes it great for both me and my husband's car.

The brush is comfortable to hold onto and easy to sweep with. The dust pan is sturdy and not bendy like some of the cheaper ones I've had in the past. A set of two is great because we can keep one right next to the litter box and another with the cleaning supplies. The black and red colors are very attractive. Since you have to use dust pans, why not have a pretty set of them?",
