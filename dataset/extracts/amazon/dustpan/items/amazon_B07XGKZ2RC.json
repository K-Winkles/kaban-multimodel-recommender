                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars sturdy and effective, but brush breaks down at 2 year mark",
                "reviewText": "The bowl brush has a sturdy ~11\" stick handle with stiff bristle head (3\" x 3\"). Both brush and plunger have an easy grip with their ergo handle shape. The brush allows easy access to cleaning under the toilet rim. To clean tougher scale/reside under the rim, grasping the handle about 5\" from the brush allows one to apply more pressure. The plunger has a ~14\" handle and a 6\" x 5\" head. It came with its own storage container , which is a real bonus. The bottom of the storage container is just plastic, so I put felt feet under it to keep it from scratching the floor. After 2 years of owning this set, the bowl brush begins shedding bristles. Not a deal breaker as all plastics break-down. I still recommend this set and will buy another one.",
