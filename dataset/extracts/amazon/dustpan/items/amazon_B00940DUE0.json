                "reviewText": "First, the pygmy elephant in the room - this thing is small. the broom is completely inadequate for trying to sweep a whole room, but it's great for pulling out when you need to spot clean some kind of a spill. I'm still giving it 5 stars and will get to why, but just don't expect this to be the last broom and dustpan you'll ever own.Where this thing shines is in the quality Oxo puts in all of their products. The silicone lip does a great job of picking up the pile of dirt and dust in just a sweep or two. The silicone grippers on the upper part are great for catching hair and fluff off the broom. The materials look striking and high quality, and the parts generally all work well. What this kind of dustpan does for you is really saves your back from having to stoop down on the floor, and that's well worth it.Given the small size, I found myself generally cleaning with a regular broom, but then coming around with this to pick up the pile I'd created, and it was well worth the extra tool to save your back and not fighting a crappy plastic dustpan you have to sweep 6-7 times and you've still got crumbs on the floor it's not catching and you're doing it all bent over the whole time.Well worth it and I keep it around in the kitchen to quickly clean and catch spills on the spot.",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved from a 3 bedroom duplex where every floor was carpeted except for the kitchen, to a 1 bedroom apartment where all but one room is either tile or laminate. I brought my old Kenmore vac with me. While it's great on all the surfaces, it's a pain to drag out for every crumb and grain of kitty litter, so I wanted something small to use in between weekly vacuums. I thought I was going to have to resort to squatting with a small brush and dustpan until I discovered this set in my complex' laundry room. I immediately ordered one for myself. It's perfect! It doesn't take up a lot of space, and it's lightweight, so I can quickly clean up messes. The teeth do a good job of removing any cat fur I pick up in the process.Should this be your primary tool to clean your bare floors? Of course not. But it is a most convenient supplement to a vacuum in a small apartment.",

                "reviewText": "OXO Good Grips Upright Sweep Set ($27.99)This is a small broom that I ordered to keep in the kids' bathroom. The bathroom floor is often covered with pet hair and my kid's hair. They have long hair and brushes it and it falls to the floor to collect. The measurements of the broom is in the description and in the photos. I took note of these and knew what to expect.The broom bristles are of high quality and stiff. I have purchased a similar broom for the main bath and the bristles were \"soft\" and \"bouncy\" and flung dust and debris everywhere while using. I love this broom as it works well in collecting, dirt, pet hair and kids' long strands. The dustpan is also very nice. Has teeth that can help filter out hair and fur from collecting on the bristles. Together the dustpan and broom snap together on the handles and the pan can be turned upright so that this could be stored in the bathroom closet and not take up much room. This is perfect for a small space. This would not be appropriate to use for a large room or space. This is exactly what I was looking for. OXO brand products rarely disappoint. Highly recommended!",

I tried to leave a weight on it to inverse the problem but the plastic is sturdy (good quality!) and impossible to fix it. I also try to explain my problem, made worse by the fact that I got rid of the original packaging by mistake, to OXO customers service their answers made me think they thought I was an idiot. After 2 or 3 fruitless exchanges with the, I gave up, not wanting to waste more my time.Results: I was a good customer for OXO, they have lost me because of a dummy customers service. Conclusion: OXO is a good brand as long as you don't have any problems.",
