                "reviewText": "I hate dustpans -- always have. I have had a Dyson for over a decade and really never saw the need for such a paltry version of my awesome vacuum. The SO and the mom always try to sneak one into my abode and I end up finding a way to destroy them or toss them. Well, this one seemed kinda cool -- so though I would try it out. Not sure why others are hating on this so hard ... I kinda like it.Yes, assembling took me and the kid a bit of time -- but you just have to sort which one is the top part for each of the poles and it's easy from there. There are only two that look that way. They are the tops.I like the little teeth comby thing that helps you scrape stuff off the broom. This is also sturdier than dimestore options, which are not much cheaper. The attachment to hold the broom is strong enough so it wont slip out, and while this is not made of high grad alloys, seems like hefty enough plastic to last. That secondary brush is for sure not an outside use item, but for this price, getting two brushes and a decent dustpan seems good to me.",

                "reviewText": "Assembling the pole segments together is a bit of a puzzle. The handle poles are packaged in two separate bags, but the bags do not correspond to the two poles. When assembling you need to make sure the plastic threaded ends are on either end of each pole, as the plastic threads attach to the broom heads and the pole handles. The poles can be assembled in different combinations to get different broom and dustpan pole heights, but I assembled each using four pole segments and was happy with the resulting height for each.The broom and dustpan are light weight when assembled. The handle is not too sturdy but should be perfectly fine for most uses. E.g., don\u2019t beat any rugs with this broom. The bristles on the broom are soft and pick up dust and dirt well. I originally thought about using the broom in the garage and outdoors, but I think the bristles are a bit too soft and would wear quite a bit if used on rough concrete, so I\u2019ll make use of it indoors. The bristles on the dustpan brush head are firmer and shorter than the broom. The brush head is a bit small, but the hideaway brush head is a nice feature. The broom and dustpan together are compact and self-standing which works well for storing them.One minor issue with the handle for the dustpan \u2013 when I tightened it, it ended up projecting over the dustpan rather than away from it as shown in the website photos. It can be rotated to instead project away from the dustpan head, but then the handle is not tight and can rotate on the shaft.",

                "reviewText": "I want to say that I genuinely really like this broom product, but there were a couple of issues that I've caught recurring that I needed to factor into the rating.The goods:- 2 styles of broom, in one!- the teeth ont he dust bin that help get debris out!- the flexible bristles on both brushes- The handles are very \"handy\" for moving them around- the neck joints are adjustable, which allows you to get into all the nooks and cranniesthe...less than goods- it took a few trials and errors to put together because it came disassembled and I didn't see the finer detailing that showed the differences between the handle pieces- the bristles are very soft, but that can lead to them missing details or have trouble brushing up more troublesome bits- the handles and rods WILL unscrew themselves over time. I have to keep tightening them. You can fix this with super glue.- not a downside, just be aware it's kinda aimed at people in the middle of the height-road, so it will be harder to use for taller people (think 5'10\" and above).This really is nice, and the only issue making this so low was how recurring the second two issues are to the function. I would give it a 3.5 if I could!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This CIWEI broom with dustpan comes with a long sweeping broom, heavy-duty push broom, and a dustpan. The dustpan is clever with self-cleaning dustpan teeth to get stuff off the broom bristles. The dustpan is 90-degree foldable. It was simple but took a bit of time to assemble the set. I am glad I got this combo set because it has been very helpful in cleaning my kitchen and living room hardwood floor where sometimes I don't feel like getting the vacuum out, or when it's very dirty and has liquid on the floor. I definitely like it, and having it helps a lot with cleaning around the house. Overall, I recommend it for its affordable pricing, functionality, and practicality of it.",
