                "reviewText": "I basically like the product but it has 1 design flaw that I find annoying when in use. When it is stored I store it so the dustpan opening is at 90 degrees to the floor with the opening pointing upward so nothing could spill out, and it makes it more convenient to store as it then lays on a flat surface. However, when I want to turn the dustpan so the opening is parallel to the surface of the floor it gets mechanically stuck - it doesn't rotate easily and I have to use my foot to flip it forward so it's usable to sweep dirt in . The same is true when rotating the dustpan so the opening is facing upward for storage - I have to use either my foot or bend forward so I can turn it with my hand to make it return it to its storage position which defeats the purchase of this dustpan design - it's supposed to eliminate the need to bend forward which is why I purchased it. I am 72 years old with a back problem - I try to avoid bending at the waist as much as possible to avoid pain. I'll be keeping it with the hope that with additional use it'll loosen up a bit to make it easier to rotate the dustpan portion. The broom is \"OK\".",

                "reviewText": "This set arrived packaged perfectly with no damage. I like that it is lightweight and easy to assemble. I also like how the broom and dust pan connects and can be stored together. The broom picks up lots of dust and it easily goes on the dust pan and not under it. Also, my favorite part about this set is the teeth on the dust pan. I love that it helps pull the hair out the broom so easily so you don\u2019t have to touch it with your hands.This is definitely a must have to add to your cleaning supplies.",

The trash doesn't go into the dustpan, it goes underneath. it often locks up when you don't want it to and when you leave it falls on its own. the dustpan always has a gap from the floor when it locks up and whatever dust you built up disappears under the dustpan.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This just arrived a few minutes ago.I purchased it strictly for the dustpan; I already had a long handled dustpan and I will only have that style from now on- they are great.I've been wanting the type that \"combs\" the brooms so that's how I got here.It only took seconds to put together, it feels sturdy so far.The broom has a small head, and the bristles are floppy (I don't like that soft type of bristle) so I don't know how that would work BUT for me, the broom isn't that big of a deal because I like my current one but, I'll try it out.My *concern* is that the dustpan is slightly warped so it isn't fully making contact with the floor, allowing debris to slide underneath.Also, there is a smudge of some sort on the rubber end so I don't know if that is damage that is responsible for the pan's flaw or if that's just from the parts making contact during shipping.Anyway, if the pan's edge doesn't make contact with the floor, it defeats the purpose of the dustpan.I'm hoping that maybe it \"settles\"? Maybe the seller has some advice.",
