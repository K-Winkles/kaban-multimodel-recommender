                "reviewText": "I was worried that I got hoodwinked when I saw how compact the box was that this broom arrived in, but it was in fact the broom I ordered. It has become our new favorite broom!! That's a normal thing people say, right? It works well, strains debris from the broom and the dustpan stands on its own so you no longer have to get just the right angle. Will buy again if this one ever breaks down.",

It was easy to put together, but when attaching the broom to the dust pan handle for storage, it wants to slip down. Think I figured out I could position the broom part in the pan - problem solved!",
