He follows us as we move from spot to spot and repeats his actions until we are don't sweeping and put the broom up (which makes him cranky). So for Christmas, he got his very own little broom and dustpan that he can make sweet, sweet love to anytime he wants. The brush sets in his cat bed, and he will nuzzle the bristles while purring like a madman until he falls asleep with his check on the broom. This pack came with three, so we put one of the others in the cat tree for him and the other is his dedicated tummy. brusher. Both the broom and dustpan are made well and there's no shedding from the broom. He isn't a chewer, so these brooms should last him a long time. The microfiber cloth got tossed into the household cleaning kit, and the little dustpans will end up being used for something. Most important thing is that his hairy highness loves his gift.",
