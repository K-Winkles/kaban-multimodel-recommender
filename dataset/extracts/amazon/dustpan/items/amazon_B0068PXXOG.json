If you don\u2019t mind a few crumbs left on the floor, you don\u2019t have to. If you physically cannot bend down, this is a great help, although, like I said you might miss some crumbs. But it definitely is better than nothing. I love that the size is big, and the width makes more room to catch more at once. It is bulky and does not attach to a broom handle. :( It would be so much better if it did attach to a broom handle. I still like it better than a traditional dustpan.",

This dustpan\u2019s entire pan area is covered with an ugly sticker that is glued on with permanent glue. It will not peel off, and I\u2019d have to use most of a bottle of Goo Gone and waaaay too much time to remove it.On top of that, it isn\u2019t a very good dustpan, as the lip isn\u2019t flush enough with the floor while using it as designed (with your foot), so much more debris goes under it than should. It takes quite a few times of moving it and re-sweeping into it to get most of the dirt into it. In the end you have to crouch down and use your hands anyway.There are better options out there and which don\u2019t have the huge, ugly, annoying sticker on them, so avoid this one.",
