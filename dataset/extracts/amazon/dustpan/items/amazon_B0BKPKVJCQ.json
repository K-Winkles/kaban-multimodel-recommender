                "reviewText": "I've had this thing for all of two hours and I'm already thrilled I bought it. I have faux wide-plank wood floors, so I mostly stick to sweeping and mopping. But I also have two low-pile 5x7ft rugs that I struggle to keep clean without a vacuum. I just moved cross-country and money is tight so I wasn't about to drop $150 for a shark stick vacuum. I saw this while I was digging through amazon looking for a budget alternative and for $16, though \"why not?\" I did a couple passes on my rugs and was SHOCKED at how much hair came up, but also that it was knocking all the dirt and debris out of the rug and onto the floor as well (so I could easily sweep it up). I also tried it on a 2x3 woven rug in the kitchen and as long as I held down the ends with my feet, it worked well too. Someone else said it doesn't work so well on high-pile/shag rugs (probably best to stick with vacuums for those), but for reference I recently bought the nuLOOM Tabetha Tribal Medallion Area Rug, and it got a TON of dirt, debris and hair (I have hair past my waist so it's about as bad as having pets for cleaning up) out of the rug. The dust rag that comes with it is thick and seems great quality. I plan on using it to dust my furniture when I'm not using it on the floor. Others have also said it washes up well in the washing machine, but I haven't tried yet. If you have mostly hard flooring, but need something for your area rugs, especially if they're lower pile - JUST GET IT.",

                "reviewText": "Broom is a good quality overall. Bristles are stiff enough to really get the dirt but flexible enough to bend under cabinets as needed. It is a good height, but I did note that the handle has a tendency to unscrew during use. Had to tighten it 3 times the last time I swept the kitchen. Other (minor) complaint is that the head of the broom is not nearly as wide as my other brooms. I had seen this comment in another review and dismissed it as petty, but I will say that it is noticeable. If I were using the broom for more than just my kitchen and laundry room (I use dust mop and vacuum through the rest of the house), I would probably be quite annoyed by this. But the highlight by far is the dustpan. I didn't realize just how nice it is to sweep dirt into the dustpan without having to bend over! Beyond that, though, is the comb in the dustpan. I have shoulder-length hair that seems to be constantly shedding, and two cats who are definitely losing hair on a daily basis (I can't imagine if they were long-haired cats!). It never seems too noticeable in the kitchen until I sweep, and all of a sudden I have a broom that is packed with hair. It is so nice to have that comb in the dustpan to clean out all the yuck without having to touch it myself. For anyone who is wondering, I also have a silicone \"brush\" that I purchased from one of those home parties (you know the ones!) that I use for cleaning my dust mop. It collects hair, even more than the traditional broom, and that can't just be shaken off. The silicone brush works nicely to clean the dust mop of all the big stuff before I throw it into the washing machine for a good clean.",

                "reviewText": "I suffer from extreme hair loss and I was tired of breaking every vacuum cleaner I used, so my Mom told me about this product. I \u201crake\u201d my bedroom floor every other day now and this product has become so important item to me. The first time I used it, I was able to rake up so much hair that it looked like a small cat on my floor when I finished the initial use. I was completely and totally amazed. It took a few times the first time, but it worked so well and even scoops up other debris as well as hair. I didn\u2019t even have to use the actual vacuum cleaner much after using this carpet rake. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with human or pet hair issues. 100 thumbs up on this!!! I wish I had found this sooner. I would have not thrown away so much money on vacuum cleaners that were breaking due to the hair I was trying to get up. I am going to purchase one for my boyfriend as he always complains about finding my hair embedded in his carpet (his vacuum broke as well). We were using canister vacuums with the handle and the hair was wrapping around so bad, it was destroying the vacuums. BUY THIS PRODUCT!!",

There's a \"knob\" (?) on the top that sticks when trying to change position of dust pan. This means you must use yours hands to push down on know while rotating the pan to the position you want. Once the dust pan starts to get dirty this will not be a pleasant task. Previous one moved much more easily and was better quality materials.",
