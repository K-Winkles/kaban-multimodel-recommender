The racks and hooks are adjustable, so I can fit different sizes and shapes of tools. The hooks are also rubberized, so they don't scratch or damage the tools. The holder can hold up to 35 lbs of weight, which is more than enough for my needs. It also looks neat and tidy on the wall.I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a simple and effective way to store their mop and broom. It is well-made, durable, and practical. It saves me a lot of space and hassle in the garage.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, the broom holders work well, they grip firmly but are not difficult to pull the broom out. the unit seems to be pretty well made, but I have a couple of complaints:1. The backing plate is too thin when using the screws to mount it. This is not an issue when using the double sided tape, but I wanted to be able to remove it without leaving a mess when you try to pull the tape off.2. The bar is too short to reach between wall studs, it should be 16\" between the mounting holes. Also, the short length makes the hooks and broom holders too close together to be really useful.That being said it is a decent unit and I like the little chrome screw caps that come with it. If not for the above issues I would have given it 5 stars.",
