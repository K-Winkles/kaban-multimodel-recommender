Yes, it is angled and I find it does corners quite well. The bristles are frim but flexiable,the performance is very good. How does the Built in scraper and comb/Teeth work? After sweeping, put the broom near the teeth and pull up. Any hair or fiber on the broom bristles will stay at the teeth and falls into the pan leaving the broom clean and ready.

                "reviewText": "This broom & dustpan combo came securely packaged. One has to screw pieces of the handle together. This is great because one can also disassemble & store it for transport. I liked it so well I decided to purchase 3.It is lightweight but durable. The plastic despite heavy use has not cracked, nor has the portions of the handle one screws together to assemble it unscrewed once screwed together. It has little plastic teeth in the dust pan that can be used to remove objects from the brush part of the broom. The handle is also tall which is helpful. I find many brooms too short.It has a soft firm brush which gets up most particles. I did prefer an older broom I had with finer softer particles for cleaning up fine dust but this one is more durable and good enough. The brush on this one has not bent or lost its shape.I think it is a good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Easy assembly only a few pieces. I was pleasantly surprised it came with a warranty. Picks up dirt and pet hair like a dream! We have a Pitsky- he she\u2019d like his husky side- and it\u2019s the solution we have been looking for. A regular broom puts too much hair back into the air to fall back down. This silicone broom grabs the hair much nicer and makes cleaning so much easier.",

                "reviewText": "I am a firm believer in Libman products... I had two awesome Libman brooms and I loved them.One day my husband was sweeping up his mess and saw a spider, breaking my favorite broom to kill it. It snapped at the bottom threads (where the broom and stick meet) and I was left with a jagged broomstick and a cracked hand broom.We bought this as a replacement. I will never bend down to sweep up ever again! I love the teeth on the dustpan and the long handle. I love that the dustpan snaps into place and can stand on its own. I frequently unscrew half of the broomstick to use as a short broom for cat litter and cleaning the air intake vent for the AC. I got the one with the yellow trim so I can see when the dustpan and bristles need cleaning. The only thing I would change is the sturdiness of the bristles. When putting the broom inside the dustpan for storage, it almost always has a few bristles that get bent upwards and end up sticking out away from the rest. A slightly bigger pan would fix that. Other than that, I love my new favorite broom!",
