This isn\u2019t commercial use quality, but it\u2019s just fine for home use, and that\u2019s all I needed. This set is a good value at this price point.",

                "reviewText": "I moved to a house with all wood floors, and my old mangled broom was not cutting it for daily tidying. This broom with dustpan combo is great! I like that I can take out a section of the handles to make it better suited for people of short stature. I didn't realize it has grabby bits on the dustpan, I don't have to grab the hair and fuzz off of the broom anymore! The bristles are longer and softer than my old broom. It's good for daily sweeping but may not work well for someone dealing with mud or lots of dirt/sand. I do wish I could lean the dustpan handle back a bit for a more natural sweep and collection motion. The ability to store the broom nestled into the dustpan provides the perfect compact footprint I desire. I'm pleased as punch with this broom for the price. 5 outta 5 stars recommend this for someone looking for a daily sweeping broom.",

                "reviewText": "While assembling this set, I found that everything felt pretty cheap. From the thin metal tubes to the broom head and dust pan container. After trying out this set, the first thing I noticed is that the bristles are too stiff and not spaced close enough together for efficient sweeping. I do like the built-in comb on the dustpan for removing debris from the broom bristles, but this is pretty standard on this type of dust pan and is not really a standout feature. Being able to assemble the handles to different heights could be handy, but then the set would be tailored to you specifically and may not be the right height for others who may also handle sweeping chores. I ended up sticking with my previous broom/dust pan set which does run about $5 more, but is worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This broom was very easy to put together. You simply screw the rods into each other, and they form a nice tight straight broom. The bristles are short so you can reach underneath cabinets or couches or wherever you may need to sweep. The bristles are nice and strong as well. The dustpan works perfectly. It\u2019s a great height and the broom can be stored inside of the dustpan folded upward, which is a great thing. The best thing about this broom is the dustpan has what I would call teeth on it, that you can scrape the broom up against to pull any additional dirt or hair off of the broom without having to run your hands across the dirty bristles to clean it, I love that about this broom.",

The handle is curved to make it easier to dump which is really nice. The broom holder on the dustpan is really nice as well and holds the broom really well. The broom is absolute rubbish for my needs, the bristles are too soft. I only took off 1 star for that because the dustpan is that nice.",

                "reviewText": "This is surprisingly light, but also sturdy. I felt like the dust pan handle height was a little high for me (I'm only 5'2\") so I left out one of the pieces and it was perfect. I like that the dust pan has the comb and a curved design on the bottom. It makes it much easier for me to clean up after my very messy chinchilla who likes to throw hay everywhere for no reason. But mostly, I intend to keep this in my workshop to clean up saw dust and debris. A lot of dust pan/broom combos in this price range are on the smaller side, but this is big enough to pick up off cuts of wood and scrap pieces.",
