The color and they way it fits together is great.UPDATED REVIEW, 10 days later: I've raised the stars to 5 stars because of exceptional customer service. After my 2 star review, I received an email asking if they could make good on the product. After some thought, I replied. They sent a new broom set out and it was not bowed and works very well. For such a low cost item I am impressed with the service and the Broom is sturdy and does not poke or damage as it sweeps and the replaced dust pan is flat and collects the debris very well. Because the colors are good and nondescript, I am thinking of buying more for the car and maybe for Christmas \"stocking\" gifts, Currently, I use this to collect the hair off the kitchen floor after my COVID trims for my elderly mom.",
