                "reviewText": "My work surface us covered by a self healing cutting mat and a large poly cutting board on which I generate thread and leather scraps. The size of this is just right for my area as is having something like this to help keep work surfaces clean.This cost more than some other options, has s/s pan, a fake silkscreened on charm and natural fiber brush. I thought in total there was a chance this was not manuf in China, but wrong.In use, of the pieces of thread and leather bits I try to sweep up many just won\u2019t budge from the work surface. Angling the ends if the bristles in the direction I\u2019m sweeping works but results in bristles bending outwards. Yes there\u2019s a static charge issue here but in the past I\u2019ve had products without the charm (read plastic) that worked much better. Others have rated this product well but my experience is equally valid. My opinion, no I would not recommend this and wished I made a purely utilitarian choice that actually worked much better.",
