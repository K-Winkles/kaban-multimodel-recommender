                "reviewText": "When we moved into our house that has brick patio in the back instead of grass, I thought, great! No more mowing! But I soon discovered that maintaining a decent brick patio involves more work than I had imagined. One of those jobs is sweeping leaves, twigs and other debris, particularly in the Fall and early Winter. By our third Fall (this year) the two straw brooms that we had moved in with had both worn down to the nub. So, when these brooms became available on the Vine program, I snatched them up.This is what I like:- They are heavy duty and wear resistant. Since we are just starting, it remains to be seen if they will last longer than the straw brooms, but they are designed for outdoor use and I expect they will.- My wife is short, so I was able to leave off one section of her handle making it lighter and easier to handle. My broom is full length, thus we have \"his and hers\" brooms for doing yard work together or separately.Some slight negatives (but not enough to remove stars):- In the cold, the metal handle gets colder than the wooden handles of our previous straw brooms. Once you put on gloves, however, this isn't an issue.- Folding the dustpan is a little clunky, but just a little. The covered dustpan doesn't work for the large leaves in our yard but works perfectly for smaller debris. When I was sweeping up leaves yesterday, I switched to a hand held dustpan which worked perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I'm disabled and I have a particular issue that doesn't permit me to bend over without paying dearly for my mistake. I've been looking for a dustpan like this that will allow me to keep my spaces clean without the need to bend over.I was a little concerned at first that the way this assembles might not be very sturdy, but it has since proven to be no issue. The handles come in four sections that are screwed together, and they have been holding up- albeit to light use as I am disabled. The handles are thicker than some, and have a padding which helps a lot as well.I really like the dustpan itself. It opens and closes easily, and when not in use will even stand completely upright without falling over even if it's not leaning on anything.",

The package weighed in at 6\u00bd pounds.Cleanhome is a familiar nameI have had success with at least one (1) other product of theirs, so, I had high expectations.Were my expectations met?Mostly. The handles are very sturdy, made of some sort of steel alloy that is highly magnetic. Each handle has a heavier duty foam stretch of handle that is comfortable. However, I found the broom head not very deep, with only three (3) rows of bristles that measure, in total, a mere \u00be\u201d. My competing brooms are at least double that. The bristles part of the broom is, therefore, for me, tall and thin. I prefer fat, for a broom. What happens is that there is less area to cover. Think of this. When I am on the road, do I want a skinny tire or wide tire. I want a wide tire, to cover more road. That holds true for these broom heads. I want wide, to cover more area of the floor that I am sweeping.Design continued.Further, the broom head, from left to right, is too long/wide. The broom head is \u201cwider\u201d than the dustpan. So, instead of sweeping directly into the dustpan, I am stopped from going in and overlap the dustpan\u2019s sides, causing debris to go outside the dustpan. I watched the listing video, and I then realized the video quickly shows the same issue. The bristles are semi-stiff, so does an adequate (but not perfect) sweep. Indoor or outdoor use?Both. There are no teeth on the dustpan to clean the broom. I am discovering, however, that for outdoor, I would prefer a much wider and deeper dustpan. So, once again, adequate, not perfect.Assembly requiredThis arrived, unassembled. Assembly was simple and easy enough that my school age toddler did it, within minutes \u2013 inserting and turning the handles to tighten.WeightFully assembled, the broom weight about (1\u00be) pounds.Sturdy? Durable?Absolutely, the poles do not bend at all, while other cheaper thin steel or aluminum poles can bend easily and eventually break.Uses?Whatever the imagination thinks up.Where was this made?Made in China.I hope my thoughts added information.",

                "reviewText": "A lot of broom and dustpan combos feel like they are more catered to people between 4'11\" and 5'10\". But this set keeps those heights and extends it up to 6'4\" easily. I like that the broom and dustpan are tall enough to suit a wider range of heights, but it's not cumbersome nor does it forget about us shorter folk. For the quality of the set, it's easy to put together and get going in about 3 minutes or less. Grabs dust and dirt easily with it's broad but not overbearing design. Great and easy to handle and the dustpan has a nice anti defiant design where you can easily lock and unlock it into position to receive trash, dump it, and hang it up when not in use. It's a great set suitable for any household or even janitorial use in the work environment.",

                "reviewText": "I assembled this Broom and Dustpan in several minutes right out of the box. First I got to say I was really curious what the differences would be between a $12 broom and this nicer full set with 2 brooms and full on dustpan. The pictures on amazon does not do it justice as you really have to get it in your hands to appreciate the broom. These are household size but almost Janitorial/ custodian quality. Broom screws and clicks together firmly and tightly - none of that movement and flex, or immediate deterioration you get with cheap brooms that slowly develop an acquire quirks and issues as you continue to wear them out. Broom bristles are thick much more firm and there is a lot more of them. Product is well balanced weight wise and no movement from the joints that screw it together. I would expect this broom to last about 4 x times as long as the cheap brooms. Also dustpan is well designed and clicks together with broom for storage.",
