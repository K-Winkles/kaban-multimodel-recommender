                "reviewText": "When I originally purchased sprinkle and sweep for the first time, I remember, seeing that, they sold their own dust pan and sweeper for the product and i already own a broom and couple of small, handheld dustpan and broom myself, but I wasn\u2019t sure if the ones that I already had would work properly or efficiently with sprinkle and sweep since I\u2019ve never tried a product like this, so just in case, I just want to head and got there broom as well. By the way, I want to mention that I love sprinkle and sweep, and in my case, I\u2019m glad that I did get the broom that they sold because the ones that I already had. I know wouldn\u2019t have worked well with the product add actually doing the swirling and sweeping it up properly, but if you have a similar kind of broom and dust pan that works well then I don\u2019t think this is a total necessary thing you need to get. And I guess that\u2019s part of the reason why I got it because when I was looking at the broom, I knew that the ones that I had didn\u2019t really look like that , so that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t really sure it would work. The only thing \u201ccon\u201d that I guess I can mention is that I wish the dust pan worked a little bit better. But I wonder if any dust pan woodwork, any better because sprinkle and sweep is a really fine fine powdery substance, so I don\u2019t think any broom or dust pan is going to do a 100% perfect job at getting everything off the floor. But honestly, I love everything about both the broom and the actual sprinkle and sweep product. It\u2019s just I mentioned the last part because I can always hear the little crunch crunching noises underneath my house slippers, lol.",
