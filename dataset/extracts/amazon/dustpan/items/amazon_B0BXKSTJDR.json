The only reason I did not give it 5 stars all the way across is because the poles on the broom and the broom itself are always coming loose. The only solution I have come up with is to add glue to the inside and let it set. I have tried several times to tighten the poles but for some odd reason they always come loose. it is a great broom and dustpan. I just wish the poles held together better.",

Everything is made of plastic, so it is very light, but durability may suffer. For me, this will be kept outside, so it is a plus as it is replacing one with a metal handle that rusted out.Note: the colors in the picture are very inaccurate. The black is really a medium grey, and the red is far less saturated than in the picture. Still looks ok.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the broom/dustpan unit for about a week. I read all the one star reviews before purchase as I usually do to determine if the pros outweighed the cons. It seemed so for this product, so I made the purchase, and can say that I have been very pleased.Things I like:1. Easy to assemble. All parts are bagged and tagged, so you know which parts are for the broom handle and which for the dust pan handle. Once put together it is all very sturdy, but not combersome.2. The handle of the dustpan will stay upright if you need two hands for the broom (I've dealt with other models where you must continually hold the dustpan handle or it crashes)3. Minor detail, but I do like that the pair clip together for storage and they do not take up a ton of room.Things I love:1. The finger like combs on the dustpan! Brilliant idea. We have large fuzzy dogs, and sweeping up dog hair is never a joy. Once I sweep up the dog hair, it makes it easy to get it off the brush and into the pan by combing through the broom bristles with the comb attached to the dustpan.2. On the lip of the dustpan that sits against the floor, there is a rubber edging that makes the dustpan sit flush against the floor, so all the sweepings go into the pan rather than slidding underneath.It's a great unit and one I would definitely reccomend.",
