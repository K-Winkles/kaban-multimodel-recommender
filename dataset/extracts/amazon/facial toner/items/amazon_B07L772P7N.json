                "reviewText": "L'Oreal Hydra-Fresh Toner has a GEL-like consistency, which is not described in product description.In dispensing this, the spillage that comes from delayed liquid drops (on a cotton pad), is annoying. The thick liquid then also comes out slowly. The return date is past and I cannot wait to finally finish them to get my Neutrogena (light-blue) Facial Toner back, although this may be discontinued.",
