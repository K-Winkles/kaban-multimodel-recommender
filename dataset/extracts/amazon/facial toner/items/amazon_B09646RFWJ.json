                "reviewText": "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Missha Time Revolution The First Essence Face Serum (5th Gen), and I must say, it has certainly made a positive impression on me. This face serum has become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason.First off, I love how lightweight and non-greasy this serum feels on my skin. It easily absorbs without leaving any residue, which is a huge plus for me. The scent is subtle and pleasant, not overpowering or artificial.One of the standout qualities of this serum is its moisturizing power. It truly quenches my skin's thirst, leaving it feeling hydrated and plump. I've noticed that my skin looks more radiant and healthy since incorporating this serum into my routine.Another fantastic benefit is how it helps to even out my skin tone. It has gradually improved the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation, giving me a more balanced complexion. It also acts as a great base for makeup application, creating a smooth canvas for a flawless finish.The packaging is also worth mentioning. The 150ml bottle is generously sized, and a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective option.Overall, I highly recommend the Missha Time Revolution The First Essence Face Serum (5th Gen) to anyone in search of a moisturizing and complexion-enhancing serum. It has become a beloved part of my skincare routine and has delivered noticeable results. Give it a try, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a loyal MISSA TIME Revolution First Essence user for years now. I purchase few bottles every year and I am used to its formulation changing. This is the first time it feels like a bit of a miss for me. Not sure why - it does not feel quite as hydrating as the previous versions. Packaging is also slightly different - it dispenses the essence a bit more sporadically, maybe that's just my product, not sure. Overall, not that happy with this reformulation, but can't quite pinpoint what it is.",

                "reviewText": "I incorporate Korean skincare in my routine and have seen a marked improvement in smoothness and clarity overall. The mirror does NOT lie.Neither does my bank balance.What started off as a trial balloon is now a keeper for me. I don't however, subscribe to the full-on mania and near-hysteria about Korean and Asian skincare in general. There's no way I have (or want to MAKE), the time for all the steps involved in a proper Korean skincare routine. Not because I don't want to but because travelling with so many products is not something I care to do. My toiletry and cosmetic kit-and-caboodle, even when streamlined for travel, weighs a bloody ton.I cherry-pick my skincare and choose what works for me across the board from Olay's Luminous Cream (quite wonderful, incidentally), to ROCs OTC Retinol creme in the bronzy-gold tube to whatever I tweak according to the season and my skin's needs.Now Missha's Time Revolution The First Essence is supposed to be verrrry similar to, and in fact the country cousin of SK 11's famous essence; the one with Cate Blanchett's ethereal skin acting as a beacon for prospective SK 11 customers. I bought a bottle from an online Korean cosmetics mall, liked how my skin reacted to it so this is my second bottle.Right off, I found this calming. I mistakenly took this for a Toner and applied it post double-cleansing to prep. my skin before absorbing a basic Serum, (an occasional OTC Retinol cream), Moisturiser and a topping of Differin Gel. I apply some on a cotton pad and gently rub it over face and neck.It makes a very good toner, in fact.There's no stinging or burning on application. NO after-burn, either.After reading the package, I sometimes apply it the way it's recommended, to wit:-- Applied with fingers directly the the skin and patted in.This works beautifully as well. It absorbs in about 30 seconds and your ready for what's next. There's what feels like a very slight stickiness on first applying this, but it dissipates in seconds.My skin's been doing well with this. I can't honestly say its made my skin any clearer than the Cosrx brightening serum but it preps my skin so well. It's akin to prepping the canvas before getting down to serious painting. If the prepping's not done right, everything that follows will reflect it.The heavy bottle is a PITA for travelling but you can pop open the plastic stopper and CAREFULLY (very carefully) DECANT the liquid into a travel-ready container.You'll notice I haven't regurgitated what it says on the package about 'barley' and what's in this stuff. Really, does it matter? I mean, I read what's on the package but I don't take it as Holy Writ. Korean/Asian skincare is EXACTLY like Western skincare in the sense that it's the Same 'Ole Blah blah blah..., quasi-scientific gobbledygook we're expected to swallow like baby birds.I'm indifferent as to what hemisphere these fatuous blurbs originate from. I just want the product to do even halfway what it alleges to do.I feel rather like Janet (What Have You Done For Me Lately?) Jackson when using the any product du jour.This I'll be using for a long time. It's innocuous, removes any residual gunk from skin post-cleansing VERY well and makes a good introduction to the world of Essences, Korea style. I was trying to reach for a word to accurately describe how my skin felt after using this Missha product and I've found it ~ it feels BALANCED. And soothed.Thank-you for taking the time to read this review. I hope it's been of help.",

                "reviewText": "I love this product so much. Extremely versatile. I use it at each stage of my routine various days depending what I need. It also will stop any product from pilling because of the oils. I always use it as the last step of my routine in the morning before I apply spf to avoid potential pilling and dryness since my sunscreen can be drying alone and pill. This product has allowed me to layer products I never would\u2019ve been able to and really layer my spf so I get the right protection. It really doesn\u2019t help everything else absorb. It doesn\u2019t clog my pores or make my acne worse, it actually has helped balance my oily skin. It\u2019s not greasy but gives a healthy glow and sinks into the skin beautifully. It\u2019s not sticky but really plumps your skin. The packaging is also really nice.it feels luxurious. The glass bottle is thick and sturdy and the application allows for controlled application so I don\u2019t waste it like other liquid products. This is now a staple for me I can\u2019t be without it. After about a week of use I noticed my super dry, cracked, bleeding hands and fingers were soft and healed! I hadn\u2019t done anything different for them and had been struggling to keep lotion on them since I wash my hands/ get my hands wet often at work and have lots of sun exposure. But then I realized I was rubbing the excess of this product on my hands morning and night when I did my skincare. This literally cured my dry hands without me even trying too! Now I just rub a drop on my hands when I feel them getting dry and they\u2019re so soft and nice now. A little goes a long way with this but you can also layer it on for extra moisture. I feel like my skin would drink the whole bottle if i dumbed it on my head lol. I will definitely be repurchasing! This was am amazing find!",
