Some days i could smell the cucumber others I get the witch hazel which I'm not used to yet. It's very hearhty..when the toner is drying , i could smell and feel the peppermint. I wish they could add some mint or eucalyptus for added tingling effect .When you apply it , try holding your breath. If you don't, you will inhale the mist and it feels weird .It feels good to spray it right after you wake up too",

The Brickell face toner is made with natural and organic ingredients, which is a big plus for me. It has a refreshing scent and feels incredibly soothing on the skin. I noticed that it helped to balance my skin's pH levels and minimize the appearance of pores. Plus, it didn't leave my skin feeling dry or tight and my oil levels have decreased.If you're looking for a toner that's gentle, effective, and made with quality ingredients, I would definitely recommend giving the Brickell face toner a try!",

Natural, soothing scent.Upon application there is a cooling, soothing sensation. No burning, tingling, drying, etc.After the first few days of use I noticed that areas of my skin that had broken out previously, but seemed to not be healing, started to seem less red and inflamed. As if my skin was finally getting back to an equilibrium. My overall skin health seemed better as well.After roughly two weeks use I can say the benefits seemed to continue. My skin looks and feels more nourished. For lack of a better word, \u2018even.\u2019 Not so blotchy, red, inflamed.Definitely an enjoyable and worthwhile addition to my skin regimen.",

I have both morning and evening facial routines, but never with a toner.I began using it for a week right after I showered in the morning. The scent of cucumber is a welcome addition to the morning. The peppermint scent is light.The label claims to reduce shine and it appears to be accurate. My forehead and nose aren't oily to begin with, but it seems to be less so with this toner. Usually by noon, I have to splash water on my face to freshen up. With the toner, I didn't have the need to.",

Since I use Brickell products I decided to go with their toner. I have dry skin and of course aging skin. Now to the toner, when I first started using it I loved the light cucumber smell and how refreshing it was. Honestly I considered that a win even if I didn\u2019t see any other differences but I did. My skin is more even and it seems to make my moisturizer work even better. I\u2019ve only been using it a couple of weeks and I can already see and feel a difference. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone who has uneven skin tones and just wants to boost their moisturizer.",

People buy this product because it's expensive and because it's in top search results, then they complain that this doesn't work. It's not the product that is failing but you not reading the labels. Although, I admire your bravery. Using things on your face without even knowing what they do? Given the fact that skin care is a very difficult subject (and expensive) knowing what you're getting should be the must.In short, yes it works.No it's not for everyone. YES, reading labels is required nowadays and for this product too.Great for refreshing your face on the go.Great for cleaning your face if your tap water is just too harsh.Great as a base for hyaluronic acid serums.Yes, they have samples for pretty much free so you can test it before you throw your money away.",
