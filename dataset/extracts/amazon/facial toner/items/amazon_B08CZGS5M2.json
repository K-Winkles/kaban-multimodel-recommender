I put this on my cheeks, forehand, and chin when I am blow-drying my hair or before makeup and it gets rid of my redness and keeps my skin from becoming warm or irritated. The cotton pad is pretty thick so I recommend pulling the cotton pad into two and using that for the face.",

                "reviewText": "Picked these up looking for toner that i can use regularly on my skin which is sensitive and extra dry lately with the cold weather. Ive had my skin turn bright red with things labeled as \"sensitive\" and have always really appreciated Skinfood's clean ingredients.I really enjoy these. May sound weird but they smell like the candle section of whole foods when you first put it on (though that may just be me, not sure). Don't know if that's a selling point or not but there it is. The pads are very thick and very saturated even at the top. My skin is sensitive and very dry and this is all I need in the morning to refresh my skin. Has enough product to use as a patch mask after wiping your face with it. I use it on my forehead that needs a little extra attention. 60 sheets means i could use them morning and night and extra saturation means whatever is left over at the end can be picked up on one of my own cotton pads to make it last even longer.PS- biodegradable container is a big plus for me and the new branding looks vintage and cute.",
