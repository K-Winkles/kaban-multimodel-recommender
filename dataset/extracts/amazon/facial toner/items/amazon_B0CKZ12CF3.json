The color was slightly different I noticed at first. Then I smelled it, completely different smell. Then I put it on my face. Normally, this stuff usually makes my face and fingers sting bc that\u2019s how acidic the product normally is. There was no stinging, in fact no acidity to the product at all. upon further examination, it seems like its water mixed with some other random yellow colored product. Complete scam.",
