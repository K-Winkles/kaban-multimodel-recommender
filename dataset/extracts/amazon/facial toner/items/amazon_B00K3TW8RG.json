The smell might throw some people off but I actually enjoy the smell.I apply this using a spray bottle, then wait for it to dry and then apply 99% aloe Vera jelly. My skin has improved greatly with this nightly method. I don't use it during the day because I just wash my face then apply sunscreen. Maybe that's why it doesn't dry me out or cause any issues. Either way it's a great product for my oily, sensitive skin",

This toner leaves skin soft and supple. Some may think that its sticky, maybe they don't know that it is the feeling of hydration. This toner not only cleanses but it hydrates, refreshes and takes care of your Ph balance which the skin needs so it will produce cells that makes your skin perfectly flawless. Thank you Sebamed! I love all sebamed products!",

Bad move. Within 2 months of dropping this from my routine, I had the worst acne in years. Turns out this was the product keeping my junk at bay. I've learned my lesson - I'll never drop this from my routine again! No idea how this stuff works better than antibiotics for my skin, but I won't take it for granted!",
