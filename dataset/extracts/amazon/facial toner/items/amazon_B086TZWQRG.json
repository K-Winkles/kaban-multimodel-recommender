Sometimes, it\u2019s a big no, a product causing an outbreak or dermatitis, or just super-sensitive skin. In those latter cases I\u2019m coming back to this toner to get my skin back to normal. Have been for the past 3-4 years.It\u2019s not exactly a miracle. Does not make skin bright and shiny and healthy overnight. It\u2019s not super-moisturizing (so you need to use other things in top). But what it is is healing. And calming. Every single time I get a disaster, a few days to a week of this product gets my face back to its prime. I still then go after other products, toners, serums, as this is not a one-size-fit-all, but this is a must for those disastrous times.",

And because it\u2019s a toner, I\u2019ve noticed it helps slug off dry dead skin prepping your face for your next skin routine, making your moisturizer soak in better. The only down side was the packaging. The box it came in look tampered with like the last product I got from Cosrx ( the top of the product box was open) - so of course I felt causations about using it. Once I inspected it and made sure to see the seal wasn\u2019t messed with, I felt better about using it.",

However, the few times I accidentally skipped the toner in my routine I noticed that my skin was more tight and dry. The toner gives some light hydration and is also amazing at soothing my skin.",
