                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommended pad for exfoliating. Also has moisturizer and soothing agents.",
                "reviewText": "TLDR: Excellent all in one exfoliant, pore tightening, soothing, and moisturizing pads. Note that they contain glycolic acid and tee tree oil, which might bother some skin types.Given the lack of testing requirements for cosmetics, and the often unsubstantiated claims for efficacy, I typically evaluate them based primarily on the ingredients, and secondly on cost. There are simply too many individual variables to determine how it\u2019ll work on each person.I checked each of the ingredients (see below) on the Environmental Working Group website. They use science-based reviews of products and ingredients to determine risk for Cancer, Allergies & Immunotoxicity, Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity, and Use Restrictions. Check out their exceptionally useful site for detailed information on food and cosmetic ingredients. I also did additional searches for those ingredients where information was limited (I\u2019m looking at you Kudzu Root Extract).Each ingredient is rated from 1 (best) to 10 (worst). The best products won\u2019t contain any non-organic ingredients with scores above 2.Here\u2019s a comprehensive list, sorted by use:Moisturizers:Dipropylene Glycol (1-2)Butylene Glycol (1)Methylpropanediol (1)Betaine (1)Ethylhexylglycerin (2)Glycerine (1-2)Sodium hyaluronate (1)Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract (?) Similar to hyalironic acidBrassica Oleracea Gemmifera (Brussel Sprouts) Extract (1)Terminalia Ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Extract (1)Soothing:Tea Tree Leaf Oil (6) - Allergies4-Terpineol (1)Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (1)Gardenia Seed Extract (1)Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract (1)Exfoliator:Gluconolactone (1)Glycolic Acid (1-4)Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (1)Salix Alba (White Willow) Bark Extract (1)Salicylic Acid (1)Tightening Pores:Pinus Palustris, Long Leaf Pine Needle Oil (1)Evening Primrose Flower Extract (1)Other:C12 14 Pareth 12 (1) - EmulsifierSodium Citrate (1) - Adjust AcidityPurified Water (1) - FillerHydroxyacetophenone (1) - AntioxidantCaprylyl glycol (1,2-octanediol) (1) - Skin ConditioningHydroxyethylcellulose (1) - Thickening1,2 Hexanediol (1) - EmollientKudzu Root Extract (?) - AntioxidantDextrin (1) - Increases solubilityDisodium EDTA (1) - Increased absorptionThe only ingredients that are of any potential concern are:Glycolic Acid - low pH and concentration use restrictionsTea Tree Oil - May be an allergenGlycolic Acid is well known as a chemical peel, and may cause skin irritation in high concentrations, so see how you react.Tea Tree oil is a wonderful natural soothing oil, but some people are allergic to it, so if you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re allergic, check for a reaction before you slather it on your face.Personally, I react well to Tea Tree Oil and Glycolic Acid works very well for me but I can\u2019t use it everyday. So I\u2019ll use these pads every few days. YMMV so decide what routine works best for you.Cost is less than $0.50 per pad, which seems a bit steep, but given that this won\u2019t be a daily use item for me, I consider this reasonable. BTW there is a ton of spare solution in the jar, so it won\u2019t dry out too quickly.Overall this is a wonderful product. It has a long ingredient list, but they all score well. There is also scientific evidence behind the benefits of each (still trying to figure out Kudzu root). If you can tolerate Tea Tree oil and glycolic acid you\u2019ll likely love these all in one pads.",

                "reviewText": "Overall I liked the product.The scent to me mostly comes off as tea tree mixed with a slightly medicinal scent. It's not super strong and doesn't bother me.The pads are very saturated in the serum.I've used these only a couple of times now. Some of the times, I felt it left my skin slightly sticky to the touch like it didn't fully absorb. But other times I didnt notice this. I'm not sure if it has to do with products I used before using this (I have just used an exfoliating scrub followed by a facial cleanser, but I do use a different cleanser depending what I want/need out of it, so perhaps the different cleanser effects how this product absorbs?). Either way, for this reason I will probably stick to keeping it with my night time skin care routine products.The first couple times I didn't use anything after this product. I did feel the produt did a pretty good job of moisturizing. I will probably chose to use a moisturizer after this product in the future, but it's good to know if I'm in a rush or feeling lazy that I would probably be okay without it. I also felt it's toning capabilities were good.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great toner in a convenient presoaked pads. It has a moderate witch hazel scent. The plastic jar is big! There's a lot of toner liquid inside too so this won't dry out anytime soon. The pads are pretty good too. Its has some thickness so it won't rip and is gentle on the skin. The embossed side is good for exfoliating your skin a bit and helps to really get any remaining cleansers. It leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated too!I can't say it helps with my acne since I still get them after using this, but I really like the clean feeling it leaves my skin. There's 60 pads in the jar so if you use this twice a day its should last you a month which is a short time. While this makes applying toner faster it is a bit more costly since toner without pads can last you a longer time at the same price. I do highly recommend it if you're looking for presoaked toner pads!",

                "reviewText": "this review is for Troubless Clear Toner Pad for Face | Gentle Peeling & Facial Soothing Toner with Tea Tree, 60 Pads (5.57 oz)I'm terrible about maintaining a regular skincare routine. These toner pads help immensely. After washing my face, I pat dry, and then use these before allowing my face to naturally dry and adding a moisturizer. These don't have an odor that i've noticed and I haven't had any kind of skin allergy to them. They're a little more spendy than I would normally pay for a facial product, but if it works for you- I would recommend.",
