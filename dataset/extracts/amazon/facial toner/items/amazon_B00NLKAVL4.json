I\u2019m going to get a different, smaller spray bottle and transfer the toner to it so that I have more control over the product. I\u2019ve had multiple beauty items with the pump dispenser like this one, and normally they\u2019re fine, but this one barely dispenses any product and what it does dispense is concentrated in one tiny area making it difficult to apply the product. I\u2019ll keep buying this, but I hope they fix the issue with the bottle it comes in.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve always had a love-hate relationship with toners ranging from questions that I get constantly at work like, \u201cis this really worth it?\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t my face going to burn from Vitamin C?\u201d And the unsolvable mystery regarding witch hazel and it\u2019s efficacy since It always seems to burn skin on contact. I have worked in Dermatology for around 9 years and I love this product. I apply twice daily, I also use Replenix Green Tea Fortified Cleanser and CeraVe PM lotion, retin-a cream, with a glycolic peel 2-3x per week depending on the amount of breakouts I get on my chin. It sounds like a ton but it\u2019s actually very quick (>2min). Being in Dermatology for so long, I have a pretty good idea of what works for acne, oily, anti-aging skin. As the information state on the packaging, Vitamin C brightens, tones, and refines fine lines. It also helps exfoliate old acne scars (hyperpigmented areas from previous acne bumps) over time.I do feel a little tingling sensation when I apply this toner, but it is not painful. I also spray onto a cotton pad an apply on problematic areas of my face as needed. I have oily Mediterranean skin, there is nothing that will get rid of excess oil/sebum from my skin for over 2 hours... this leaves my skin matte and vibrant for around 4 hours until my inherited skin traits kick back in.This also has Vitamin E and Glycolic Acid in it. Vitamin E is good for cell rejuvenation, maintaining healthy skin and can be used to prevent aging/ increase healing (in some cases) Glycolic Acid is a great exfoliator and helps get rid of those hyperpigmented areas after a pimple has gone away.All that said\u2014 I think this is a worthwhIle purchase. You have many options when it comes to skin care and usually the dollar amounts matter the most. This is a very inexpensive helpful option for acne prone, oily, anti-aging skin and will last months. The entire line of InstaNatural seems very effective and wallet friendly. I would highly recommend this product as well as the InstaCare line to my patients.",

                "reviewText": "When they switched to the new bottle, the formula changed. I really enjoyed the old mist bottle, but I figured I'd give the new packaging a try as long as the formula was the same. When I received it, I compared both and realized they weren't the same. Meh... tried it anyway. I even put the new stuff in the old bottle. Whelp, I've gone through 2 of the bottles with the new formula and my pores aren't looking as great as they were with the old formula. I forgot how well the original helped my skin. I'm now in the market for something that has the old ingredients. This new stuff isn't horrible, just not as great. I say, try it out for yourself. You'll for sure know after one bottle if it's worth it. As for me, I'm 41 and need something a little stronger.",

                "reviewText": "I am extremely happy with ALL of the InstaNatural products that I have purchased and used so far!! I am currently using Vitamin C Facial Toner, Moroccan Rose Water, Age-Defying Skin Cleaning Serum, Age-Defying Moisturizer, Emu Oil, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Argon Oil Hair Mask, Argon Oil, Vitamin C Serum, and Eye Gel. I have tried countless skin care products from different companies in the past, but I have never been happier since I found InstaNatural products.My daily facial care routine is:1) Cleanse - wash my face with organic soap and exfoliate2) Tone - spray Moroccan Rose Water (morning) / Vitamin C Facial Toner (night) I also spray these throughout the day to refresh my face. Both smell great!3) Serum - apply Hyaluronic Acid Serum (morning) / Age-Defying Skin Cleaning Serum (night)4) Under Eyes - apply Eye Gel5) Moisturizer \u2013 apply Age-Defying MoisturizerMy hair care routine is after washing my hair in the shower, I apply Argon Oil Hair Mask throughout my hair as a deep conditioner/treatment and wash it out at the end of my shower. I apply Argon Oil and Emu Oil to my dry hair (especially to the ends) whenever my hair gets frizzy.These products are made of high-quality, predominantly natural and organic ingredients combined with beneficial vitamins and acids. Also of much importance to me, these products do not rely upon preservatives, artificial colors and fragrance to create the illusion of efficacy. I have found that all InstaNatural products have a pleasant, mild and natural scent and that products absolve into skin and hair without feeling greasy. The products work great for moisturizing skin and hair without causing any breakouts on my face and body or making my hair flat. Also, the company provides excellent customer service. In addition to providing detailed instructions regarding the use of the products, the people I have communicated with are happy to answer any questions. This company truly cares about customers and is trying their best to make safe and effective products at a reasonable price.",
