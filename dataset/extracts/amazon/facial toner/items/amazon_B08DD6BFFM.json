                "reviewText": "I\u2019m really glad I gave this one a second chance. I bought it, used it twice, decided I didn\u2019t like the way it coated my face, and shoved it into a corner for about a month.On a whim, I tried it again one day after a shower. What I noticed is that the light coating it provides made my moisturizer glide on like silk. As the day goes on, my face stays looking hydrated. So, I\u2019ve been using it ever since for about two months. Now I feel like my routine would be incomplete without it.You could, if you have oilier skin, use this as your only moisturizer in a pinch. I like that it primes my face so beautifully, even though I don\u2019t wear makeup. It makes the moisturizer glide and settle nicely.I *think* it also creates a sort of plump look to the skin. I am not sure that lessens scars or deals with discoloration yet. I do know, however, that it makes my skin look dewy and refreshed.I\u2019ve experienced no irritable or breakouts. My skin is hyper-sensitive, it reacts to fragrances even before they touch my skin. Sometimes it burns slightly upon application, but it does not irritate or damage the skin in any way.It creates a very, very light coating on the face. But I have applied topical acne medication in spots over it and it didn\u2019t prevent the treatment from penetrating. It plays well with niacinamide, which is in my la Roche Posay moisturizer, BP, and BHAs.I wrote elta asking if I could apply it before applying my retinoid at night. They said they don\u2019t know and told me to consult my derm. Therefore, I only use it in daytime, after my morning cleansing. I would like to try it as a buffer to my Tazorac at night, but until my derm says it\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t.I think toners are absolutely necessary when you live in a hard water area like I do. But it has taken me years to find one that doesn\u2019t break me out. Prior to this, I used rose water occasionally or no toner at all. I\u2019m actually terrified elta will stop making this. Above all, its main benefit is that it removes residue from hard water and facial cleanser and restores the ph balance. That is all you should expect of a toner. But the added benefits listed above make this a keeper.",

I actually put it in a smaller spray bottle and carry it in my purse so that I can spritz when I need a little boost of hydration. Dont know if I should do that but I trust all EltaMD products to be safe enough to use in that manner.It really helped my skin when I needed it most - I was using too many actives and my face was reacting to retinol, vitamin C...etc. I simplified my routine and came across this product along with the moisturizers and this was key to my healing process.",

The only concern I have, the safety seal was not on the bottle when I opened it, and the toner bottle was not filled to the top. I am not trying to send a bad review. I want to make sure I am not buying a used product.??Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I've never used a toner on a regular basis before, but after a recent facial and discussion with the cosmetologist, I decided to give one a try. I've used other Elta MD products for several years, so I decided to try out their toner. I also purchased a new lotion, Barrier Renewal Complex, in hopes that the two together would be beneficial to my skin as I age (currently in my late 40's). I really like the result! I use them once daily (twice is recommended but I'm usually too lazy to do that). My skin feels so soft, looks healthier, and does seem to have fine lines decreasing a little bit. This toner feels good on my skin, tingles a bit but doesn't burn or dry out my skin.",
