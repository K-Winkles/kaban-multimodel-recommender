I've always received compliments on my skin, but it's definitely increased since I've been using this.My makeup looks better. I have very oily skin, but I'm experiencing very little oily breakthrough during the day. It's well into the afternoon before I have to de-shine my face.",

                "reviewText": "The Wow Skin Science Vitamin C Skin Mist Toner is a refreshing way to finish your skincare regimen for the day. Simply wash your face as you normally do and then spray the product several inches away from your face. Once the product was on my face it took a few seconds to quickly absorb into my skin. There is an uplifting and pleasant scent of citrus from a combination of lemon and orange essential oils. Surprisingly, there is a faint scent of lime even though lime is not one of the listed ingredients and is pictured on the product packaging. The mist is lightweight and once absorbed into the skin, I noticed that there was no residue remaining from the toner. After each use, I found my skin felt immediately refreshed and hydrated while soft to the touch. During this time, I have also noticed that my skin looks brighter. I was happy to find that this toner does not have a stinging initial feel like other toners I have previously used. The ingredients used include purified water, glycerin, witch hazel extract, aloe vera extract, and benzyl alcohol. The manufacturer notes that this product has no parabens, silicones, mineral oil, or sulfates, and is suitable for all skin types. This product is cruelty-free, 100% vegan, gluten-free, and formulated in the USA but is made in India. The Wow Skin Science Vitamin C Skin Mist Toner refreshes and hydrates your skin with a light mist incorporating the happy scent of orange and lemon. It's a good quality toner that's worth trying.",
