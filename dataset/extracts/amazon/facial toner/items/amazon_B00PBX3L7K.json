                "reviewText": "I am prefacing this by saying that I am 46, and have oily, large pores, with some texture. I purchased this after a lot of research into this product and saying that it could help with texture. I had first was nervous because I do have very oily skin and I was afraid that it was going to produce a lot of oil during the day as many skin care products do.I wanted to write this review after a few weeks of using this because I didn\u2019t want to give my initial reaction. However, this has stayed the same for my skin so now I will tell you.I spray my face with a little water, use 2 pumps, and press it into my skin after cleansing. I then follow up with a moisturizer. I use this in the morning.I have noticed that my skin is producing a lot less oil, and it is a lot more controlled than before. I guess because this is giving me the moisture knees as opposed to my skin over producing the oil during the day. I have noticed a definite change in the texture of my skin. It is a lot smoother, brighter, and I noticed I am not getting any reaction from the serum. I even noticed that during my hormonal breakouts they were Less than if I did not use this product. I have also noticed a reduction in the visibility of my pores, and I can\u2019t believe that I have actually gotten compliments on my skin a few days after using it.I don't notice any smell and the texture of the product does not gross me out.So if you have skin like me, give this a try.",
