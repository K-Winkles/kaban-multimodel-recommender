I use it before putting on hyaluronic acid, as apparently it's important for the serum to have water to bind to, otherwise the hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from deep within your skin. I also set my (mineral powder) make-up with it or use it as an all-round refresher. My GF was getting breakouts from another product not realizing it had added oils in it. This is real actual rosewater, no oils. Yes it does not smell as strongly as those products, but I buy this for skin benefits, it's not a perfume.",

My little sister also uses this (I guess you could say we share it) but with 2 people using this on a daily basis I'm surprised at how long it's lasted without me having to buy again! The only thing I don't really care for is the scent of this product! It's a very strong floral scent and kind of reminds me of dirt lol but at the same time the scent makes it feel more organic also!

I've been using it as a toner, with an extra spritz under my eye cream at night, and my problem skin actually looks nice! I took one star off my review because the scent is a little more earthy and rooty than expected. Admittedly, I'm used to cheaper versions of rose water that smell like grandma's tea roses, and this is clearly much nicer, but still the scent is a bit of a surprise.",

                "reviewText": "I've used and loved the white rose water from this brand as well, so I decided to try this one, and it's just as lovely and hydrating to the skin. The fragrance is fresh and natural and I like that I can feel confident using it on my skin since it's organic and pure, real rose water (not rose oil and additives). Even with daily use the bottle lasts quite a while. In the summer it's especially nice to carry with me and spritz when I get too warm. It calms redness right down. I'll continue to buy this, and the white rose water.",
