                "reviewText": "When it comes to skincare, finding a product that truly does double duty can be a game-changer. The LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer is one such product that has earned a permanent place in my skincare routine, and I am thrilled to share my experience with it.Hydration Powerhouse (5/5):Laneige's Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer is like a drink of water for your skin. Its unique formula combines the benefits of a toner and moisturizer, providing intense hydration without any heaviness or greasiness. From the very first use, I noticed how it instantly plumped and refreshed my skin, leaving it soft and supple. This product is a savior for those with dry or dehydrated skin, as it helps lock in moisture all day long.Ceramides and Peptides (5/5):What sets this product apart is its inclusion of ceramides and peptides, two powerhouse ingredients known for their skin-repairing and anti-aging properties. Ceramides help strengthen the skin's natural barrier, while peptides promote collagen production, leading to firmer and more youthful-looking skin. The combination of these ingredients makes this toner & moisturizer not just hydrating but also incredibly beneficial for long-term skin health.Lightweight and Fast-Absorbing (5/5):One of the key selling points of this product is its lightweight, watery consistency. Unlike traditional creams and lotions, it goes on like a liquid and absorbs almost instantly, making it suitable for all skin types, including oily and combination. It doesn't leave any residue or stickiness behind, making it a perfect choice for layering under makeup or other skincare products.Versatility (5/5):The versatility of LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer is impressive. Whether you're looking to simplify your skincare routine or need a hydration boost, this product can be used as a toner, moisturizer, or both. I often use it as a toner to prep my skin for other products or as a refreshing mist throughout the day to revive tired skin.Soothing and Calming (5/5):If you have sensitive or irritated skin, this product is a soothing balm. It calms redness, reduces irritation, and has a gentle, comforting effect on the skin. I've noticed a significant reduction in redness and sensitivity since incorporating it into my routine.In conclusion, the LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer is a skincare superstar. Its unique formula, enriched with ceramides and peptides, provides unparalleled hydration and long-term skin benefits. The lightweight texture, versatility, and soothing properties make it a must-have for anyone seeking a simplified yet effective skincare routine. It has become my go-to product for achieving radiant, healthy skin, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to skincare enthusiasts of all ages and skin types.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used tons of toners over the past few decades because they help prevent hair bumps from shaving. I had never tried Laneige\u2019s cream toner because for one thing, I had never heard of the brand. For another, it was WAY out of my drugstore budget for such personal items. The price is the only reason I gave this four, rather than five stars and I\u2019m still not sure I should have done that since I feel it\u2019s worth the money.I have dry, sensitive, skin with large pores and this toner seems to be addressing all of my issues. I love that my skin truly feels hydrated after I apply it. I don\u2019t use cotton balls as I used to with other toners. Rather, I just shake a few drops into my hands and apply to my face.I travel a lot and I keep at least two bottles at all times, one of which stays perpetually packed in my suitcase. It\u2019s perfect under my makeup and though I do use a face serum on top, it eliminates the need for moisturizer. All of that said, nearly $40 is quite steep for me. I'm used to trying to gain as much value for as little as possible but the ease of use and outcomes I get from its use justify this as an expense for me.",

It moisturizes but doesn't feel sticky afterwards, it makes my skin feel wonderdul! It give me the moisture boost I need without being overly heavy or overly matte. This product also has no scent at all which is great because other fragrance free products I've tried end up havinf a weird smell.Love love love this! I bought the mist spray top too so, I don't lose any product down my hands!",
