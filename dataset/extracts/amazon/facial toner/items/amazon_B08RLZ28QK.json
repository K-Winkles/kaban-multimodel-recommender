                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2022",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I like it so far",
                "reviewText": "SHORT TAKE: I don't find this to be moisturizing by itself but it does help my actual moisturizer work so much better. I love the ingredients (as you can tell from reading the rest of the review!) I'm a fan of K-beauty but not everything I've tried works as well as this does so far. I also love that there's no discernable scent. This was nicely packaged & had a good foil seal on it.1st IMPRESSION: The \"water\" doesn't evaporate on the back of my hand immediately and I can see that it doesn't take but a couple of \"dots\" of the product to cover most of my face so the bottle should last for a while. After I tried this for the first time, I found it to be slightly tightening on my skin & worried that it might be drying so I wasn't sure about it. When checking the ingredients via INCIdecoder.com (which I usually do BEFORE I buy something), I decided to keep using the product for a while to see how things go. Because parts of the writing on the box and on the bottle are in Korean (because it is made in Korea :-), I used Translate to check (see photos). I love that the bottle came very well sealed.Goals: I am 61 with decent skin that is a combo of dry/very dry. I am starting to see fine lines across the forehead and small brown spots. Also, my skin has been feeling dryer and more \"tired\". I'm not trying to be young again but I want something to use along with my moisturizer to help keep my skin clear & balanced no matter my age.VALUE: It doesn't take much of this to treat my face and neck so I think it's a good value. The bottle is going to last a while even with my using it morning and evening.INGREDIENTS: Since this is \"ginseng essence water\", I wanted to know where the ginseng ingredients fell on the whole list. #1 is Panax ginseng root water so that's somethin; #5 is water; #13 is 13. Panax ginseng callus culture extract; #13 is 17. Panax ginseng root extract; and #18 is Panax ginseng berry extract. I also notice that there is some Theobroma cacao(cocoa) extract as ingredient #14. 3 of the first 4 are either considered to be moisturizing or humectant & the 7th ingredient is water. Of all 24 ingredients, 10 are moisturizing or humectant and/or a \"skin-identical\" ingredient.MY ROUTINE: Wash, pat dry, and use this product(especially around my nose) before using a Manuka honey serum and a moisturizer. When I finished my full routine, I noticed that my skin felt slightly tingly - but not unpleasant. My face is moisturized but not oily and feels really good to the touch. The photo is with no makeup. I'm going to keep an eye on the \"tingly\" feeling because that could be good or not.I will keep trying this for a while because I think my skin is just getting used to it. I like the way my face feels - moist but not oily and very refreshed and \"awake\". There isn't any irritation so I'm optimistic.I will come back to update this after I've used the product in my routine for a couple of weeks.The full list of ingredients on the label are: Panax ginseng root water, Butylene glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl glucoside, Xanthan gum, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Panax ginseng callus culture extract, Theobroma, cacao(cocoa) extract, Dextrin, Glucose, Panax ginseng root extract, Panax ginseng berry extract, Lactobacillus/Panax ginseng root ferment filtrate, Sodium hyaluronate, Ethylhexyglycerin, Disodium EDTA.I REALLY like this & when I checked the INCI Decoder site & learned more about what each ingredient does, I know why. ( Anti-acne: Niacinamide; Antioxidant: Panax Ginseng Root Extract; Cell-communicating ingredient: Niacinamide, Adenosine; Skin brightening: Niacinamide; Skin-identical ingredient: Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate; Soothing: Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, AllantoinShow all ingredients by function; Other Ingredients- Antioxidant: Hydroxyacetophenone; Chelating: Disodium EDTA; Emollient: Panax Ginseng Root Extract; Moisturizer/humectant: Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Dextrin, Glucose, Sodium Hyaluronate; Preservative: Ethylhexylglycerin; Solvent: Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water Viscosity controlling: Xanthan Gum; Dextrin.)",

Since I\u2019m unable to shell out an arm or a leg, I decided to give this product a try.The whole point of essence is to prep your face for the moisture and goo to come, and let me tell you that just TWO drops of this stuff will give your face a sticky feeling that bodes well for gripping the heck out of whatever might come next (it\u2019s serum).There\u2019s no smell and it doesn\u2019t burn, however I haven\u2019t tried drinking it or putting it in my eyes, as this is not part of any skincare routine as far as I know. My skin has had no negative reaction to it whatsoever.Only downside: My very stinky older sister dropped the cap and it cracked so now I won\u2019t be able to travel with it.",
