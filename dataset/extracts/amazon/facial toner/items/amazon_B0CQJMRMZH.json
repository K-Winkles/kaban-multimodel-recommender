While it feels gentle on my skin, it\u2019s productive and I\u2019ve noticed a more clear complexion. The smell is subtle and it doesn\u2019t have a burn when applied. I generally follow up with an intense moisturizer, but I can see that this could certainly cause some dryness without the added hydration.",
