                "reviewText": "\u2705Likes:\u25cb I feared I might've been overly swayed by the GORGEOUS packaging on this one but it's surprisingly nice for a toner! I normally don't see the point of toners- most seem like water and hard to apply w/ hands and ultimately end up feeling like an extra unnecessary step that I'm the first to skip when lazy in my skin care routine. However this seems more like a serum than a toner! Seems like it would be great for providing slippery surface w/ facial massagers/devices.\u25cb Seems extremely hydrating for a toner, glycerin is a great product that I've been trying to replace my hyaluronic acid products with eventually.\u25cb Love that this is alcohol free and has some other interesting ingredients (LIST AT BOTTOM), that my scanner likes:Adenosine - wound healing, anti-inflammatory, potential collagen production assist, barrier repair + protect,Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate - (licorice?) soothing/anti-inflammatory, might be sebum regulatingBetaine - moisturize+skin protect, osmolyte control cell water balance\u25cb Mostly fragrance free, there's some sort of distant botanical/floral echo of a scent in there but \"basically\" no strong fragrances or anything. There's only one ingredient that came up on the \"icky\" rating on my scanner site and it's the \"Rosa Damascena Flower Oil\" which seems to be an expensive ingredient which is an antioxidant, perfuming, and antimicrobial/antibacterial agent \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f possible irritant I guess but it's low on the list and doesn't sound too dangerous to me tbh\u25cb Expires 2025, clearly written at bottle bottom- great!\u274cDislikes:\u25cf Weirdly I don't see Niacinamide nor Alanine in the ingredients list despite it being in the listing info?\u25cf Bit hard to get out of the bottle, need to shake it to get anything out and when you do it just splats everywhere. I know most toners have bottles with basic openings like this but most toners aren't this viscous. I wish it had a squirt depositing pump head.\u25cf Also FYI it's a plastic bottle (not frosted glass like I'd expected) and the bottle is too firm/thick to squeeze anything out which seems a bit unnecessary plastic-wise. Thick screw cap too. Would've probably served better to make it thinner plastic to help control depositing product.\ud83d\udd2eFUTURE/TBA:~ Any glaringly obvious long term skin benefits due to this product.\ud83d\udcb8Would you repurchase?:Not totally sure yet if I see the \"value for product\" yet for my personal budget. Based on the market and my frugality, I'm unsure yet if it would be a definite re-purchase. I will certainly update in the distant future if it is.First impressions, will update if I find further benefits or issues w/ more use in the future.Ingredients: WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, NEOPENTYL GLYCOL DIHEPTANOATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 LAURATE, CARBOMER, COLLAGEN EXTRACT, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, TROMETHAMINE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, ADENOSINE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA, JUNIPERUS MEXICANA OIL, PYRUS COMMUNIS (PEAR) FRUIT EXTRACT, MELIA AZADIRACHTA FLOWER EXTRACT, MELIA AZADIRACHTA LEAF EXTRACT, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, ROSA DAMASCENA FLOWER WATER, IRIS FLORENTINA ROOT EXTRACT, ROSA DAMASCENA FLOWER OIL, BETAINE, CUCUMIS MELO (MELON) FRUIT EXTRACT, HEDERA HELIX (IVY) LEAF/STEM EXTRACT, AVENA SATIVA (OAT) PEPTIDE, COCCINIA INDICA FRUIT EXTRACT, CORALLINA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, POGOSTEMON CABLIN OIL, VETIVERIA ZIZANOIDES ROOT OIL",

You need quite a bit to cover your face and neck so the value just isn't there. Smell isn't good or bad just eh. Would not recommend.",

I love the packaging and think it is so pretty. However, it's kinda hard to get the product out of the bottle since it is pretty thick, and think they should've made the bottle less hard or somewhat squeezable. Or they could've made the hole at the top larger so the product dispenses easier. The toner itself is nice and moisturizing and I feel so clean and refreshed after applying. I use it both day and night as these products aren't too heavy for daytime use but moisturizing enough for nighttime use. I love this line so much, that I'm thinking about buying the cleanser and the moisturizing cream as well. My skin actually does feel more youthful after about a week or so of using it daily. I'm a new fan of this company and would definitely purchase other products from several of their lines. I highly recommend this line for everyone but especially for those who love their skincare!",

I waited to write a review to see if I noticed any visible difference in my skin. I have not at this time. No difference in wrinkles or tightness. However, I do like using this product. It feels nice being applied and kind of has a pampering quality about it. It moisturizes but not enough for the dry desert heat. So I still use a second moisturizer. Overall I like this I just wish I had seen wrinkle improvement sooner (or at all)...",
