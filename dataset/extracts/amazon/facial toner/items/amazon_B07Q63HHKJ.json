                "reviewText": "I haven't used it long yet but it has a nice cooling effect that isn't too cold [like if you use something with peppermint in it] and it leaves your skin feeling really refreshed. I primarily bought this because I'm vegan and wanted a witch hazel that was cruelty free/vegan without paying an arm and a leg- and I also loved that this is more of a soap so I didn't have to buy or use cotton balls/pads to rub it on my skin. It has a very light scent that's fresh- [take that tea tree oil- you smell like floor cleaner!] and I noticed the very first time I used it that some of the darker gunk in the pores around my nose went away immediately. This is such a big deal because I've used exfoliators, other cleaners that were far more expensive that claimed they would do that- and none made it go away. THE VERY FIRST TIME this worked. I'm going to keep using it for a month and hopefully I'll remember to update this review. I'm also going to use aloe after I wash my face with this to help with moisture. We'll see how it goes! So far, so good!",
