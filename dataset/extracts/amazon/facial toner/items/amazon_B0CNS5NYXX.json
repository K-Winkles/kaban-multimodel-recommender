Pros: Pretty neutral scent, clean tingly feeling on skin, leaves my skin smoother when used under moisturizer both am and pm, tone appears more even. Cons: Bottle is glass, no dispenser top on the mouth of the bottle. Comes with a stopper that I did THINK had a small dispensing hole in the center, but upon closer inspection, it's solid. Too bad because such a top would've been ideal. Price is a bit high, but a little goes a long way on a cotton ball, so I expect this bottle to last a while.",
