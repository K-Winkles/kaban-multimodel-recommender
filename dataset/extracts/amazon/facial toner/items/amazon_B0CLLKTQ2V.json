                "reviewText": "My mature skin tends towards the sensitive. Even washing my face tends to make it redden. When I use this toner/essence after cleansing, the redness calms right down. It's also completely scent free and there are no added fragrances which I love. It doesn't leave my skin feeling tight and it also provides a great base for the rest of my skin care.The ingredient list is absolutely amazing! Run it through your favorite skin care ingredient checker and see how many of the ingredients light up in the goodie column. It's got multiple weights of hyaluronic acid to make sure that your skin gets all the opportunity it can to retain moisture. There are also a bunch of essential amino acids that help moisturize, repair, and smooth your skin.Some of the highlights are:\ud83e\udc3aAnti-acne: Niacinamide\ud83e\udc3aAntioxidant: Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Cysteine\ud83e\udc3aCell-communicating ingredient: Niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine\ud83e\udc3aSkin brightening: Niacinamide\ud83e\udc3aSkin-identical ingredient: Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Glycine, Serine, Aspartic Acid, Alanine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Threonine, Valine, Isoleucine, Histidine\ud83e\udc3aSoothing: Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate\ud83e\udc3aMoisturizer/humectant: Centella Asiatica Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Glutamic Acid, Histidine, Beta-Glucan, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Betaine, Caprylyl Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, GlucoseWhy use a basic witch hazel toner when you can use one that also has a ton of other great skin care ingredients. The BACIEL Hydra Barrier CICA Essence Toner is a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "I think the Baciel Hydra Barrier CICA Essence Toner is likely suitable for all skin types/users. It is completely odorless, colorless, with a texture slightly heavier than water but still runny and lightweight, non-irritating, and not greasy, heavy, tacky, or stick on the skin. For reference, I'm over 40, with highly reactive, sensitive, congestion prone, combination skin. This leaves me with a matte finish and is not drying.You get a fair amount of liquid essence/toner (6.7oz in a frosted plastic bottle) for less than $30. While many of the ingredients are ubiquitous, they are effective (hyaluronic acid, CICA, niacinamides, almond oil). And I'm pleased to see Centella Asiatica, the highlighted ingredient, is first on the list instead of just water.To Use: This can be used in place of your essence or toner or both. Often, I will wash and tone with something else then apply a little of this by dribbling a dime-sized amount of liquid into my palm and lightly patting it over my face and neck. Then I use a good (not especially thick or expensive) moisturizer and SPF (in the AM).Overall, I am extremely pleased with the use, quality, lack of filler, and fragrances of this essence/toner.",

They are the \"Super Peptide\" ~ Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and Glycerin. Of course, it has many other great ingredients added to these big time anti-aging ingredients that help with the production of collagen, elasticity, hydration, and skin plumping. It seems to have the perfect blend and the perfect consistency for my 50 yr young, combination to somewhat dry, and imperfect skin.I've been using it as a toner on a pad first, and then again as an essence by patting a bit into my skin. It has a somewhat thin serum like consistency that spreads very easily and sinks in quickly, without leaving any tackiness behind. My skin feels hydrated, very soft and ready for the rest of my skin care routine.This Essence Toner has so many skin-loving ingredients that it's like super food for your skin. I absolutely love it, and would definitely recommend it!",
