This was tolerable.What has caused me to no longer continue using this product is due to extreme breakout. They started off under my skin..so they hurt, and then would go into full bloom with huge white heads. I havent had pimples that came in clusters like that since 2007. It happened twice, lasting about 1 week each month i used it. This is my first full month not including the serum to my regimen and my skin is slowing going back to normal; with a few dark acne scars to add to it.",
