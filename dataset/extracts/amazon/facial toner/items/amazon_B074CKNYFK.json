Having such sensitive skin I am always very skeptical especially having to pay out allot of money to find out it either doesn't work, I break out or even am left with chemical burns and rashes. I found this product and was hopeful especially, for the price. I purchased the Himalaya Botanique balancing neem and tumeric face wash along with the clarifying toner. I am happy to say that I have used these two products almost to the end and am getting ready to purchase more. For anyone who struggles with sensitive skin like me you will know how difficult it is to find products that work. I am so happy to have found these products and urge anyone in the same situation to give it a try!!!!",

Para pieles mixtas (como la mia) funcion\u00f3 muy bien ya que deja una sensaci\u00f3n refrescante, limpiadora y un poco astringente. Hizo que mi piel tuviera cierta luminosidad y se sintiera m\u00e1s reafirmada pero s\u00ed recomiendo que se acompa\u00f1e de una crema hidratante. Ojo, yo llegu\u00e9 a usar algodoncitos y tallar mucho en la piel pero no lo recomiendo ya que puede irritar y causar rojeces jaja \ud83d\ude02",
