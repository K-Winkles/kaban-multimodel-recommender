I use this in the morning as part of my routine - right after washing my face but before serum and moisturizer. I do not spray directly on my face - I spray 3 pumps on clean, dry hands and pat on my face to get better coverage. It dries quickly and I also find that is not tightening, gives a bit of moisture to the skin. Oddly enough, I have also noticed the fine lines around my eyes are also less noticeable. I am currently on my third bottle of this product and will continue to use - positive results for me.",
