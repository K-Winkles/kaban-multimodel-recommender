                "reviewText": "The Amarose rose water is a nice toning mist that smells fantastic and comes in a cute little box. The packaging makes it great for gifting or keeping for yourself as the bottle stands nicely in the little display. You get a rather large bottle and the spray is nice and fine. It smells nicely of roses but is not too overpowering. The mist is lightweight and you can easily use this any time of the day as a base or just as a pick me up. I personally thought my skin looked hydrated after use. In summary this is a great looking toner that smells nice and feels good on dry or even oily skin.",
