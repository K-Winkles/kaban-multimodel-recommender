I'm more on the oily side so the tea tree oil really helps control that and helps with preventing breakouts! I noticed almost instantly how different my skin looked, it appeared smoother and more even-tone. Shea Moisture has a lot of great products, however the African soap line is best suited for people with acne prone skin. They do have a charcoal version instead of tea tree oil, which did NOT work for me. Charcoal reacts different with my skin, but that doesn't mean it won't for you. Overall i'm extremely happy as I was able to find a toner decently priced and that works.",

                "reviewText": "I love this toner! I have smart skin, so I must change products every couple months, just so my skin doesn't catch onto me trying to help it from turning into a deplorable mess. This toner does a great job of controlling the oils in my skin, without drying it out. I think it is somewhat magical. It is pleasant, non-irritating, and generally very good for someone with combination skin who is also a dermatologists worst nightmare. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for years.It balances my skin, and is a great pre-wash spray to get pores extra clean. I\u2019ve battled acne for 30+ years, and I have found that this product really helps minimize/heal breakouts. Sugar and starches are a major cause of acne (gut), not necessarily poor hygiene. Your skin is a reflection of what\u2019s going on inside your body. Pay attention to that. Food allergies? I do recommend washing your face once a day, but spray this on clean skin, and five minutes before you wash (gentle natural cleaner.)",
