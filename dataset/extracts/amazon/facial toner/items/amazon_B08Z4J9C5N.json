                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best toner for my sensitive skin!",
                "reviewText": "I am so glad I got a full size of this product and gave it a few weeks to see really glowing results! I had come across a sample size of it and noticed instantly that it was very good at cleaning debris from pores; but I could not judge much more about it than that. There was a pretty cool sale price in December on Amazon so I ordered a full sized bottle. I have now used the product everyday for 3.5 weeks\u2026. INCREDIBLE!!!!CONVENIENT: It is great on its own as a quick on the go cleanse and moisturize, or to use as a daily toner. It is pretty necessary to use this product in the spray bottle that the full size comes in, it\u2019s convenience really shines when it is in a spray bottle. It also seems to last forever, despite being liberal with my use for this period of time I have only made a dent about 1/5th of the bottle, I\u2019m sure the sprayer helps with that, I hate it when you have to dab toners from a puddle in your hand or cotton swab. With the sprayer waste no product and no time! (Non-aerosol sprayer by the way, just the kind you push with your finger to get a spritz.)GENTLE: I have fairly sensitive skin. It varies according to season, weather, climate, my cycle, stress. I also admittedly sometimes over do it with products or exfoliating. December is high risk for sensitivity what with the weather changes, heaters on, and it was the most stressful December of my life to date in 2022 when I tried Eight Saints toner. The toner didn\u2019t burn or tingle at all, not once. I wouldn\u2019t alarmed but a mild burn after exfoliating but even so, this was a very gentle product for how much power it has! I can\u2019t remember using a toner that didn\u2019t burn at least sometimes, which is why I don\u2019t often use toner. This duckling has imprinted to this toner\u2026..CLEANSING: This was my original draw to this product, I noticed it dislodged some dirt from my pore on first contact without any side effects. My water barrier has stress related issues, no lies part of the problem is the Mississippi curse\u2026 due to this intergenerational stress combined with my own personal stresses, my skin doesnt always react to products the way it is \u201csupposed\u201d to, and I wouldn\u2019t call it dry, oily, nor combo. I would call it flaky. Heh. Doesn\u2019t matter how much water I drink or moisturizer I use sometimes. I get milia and my pores have trouble expelling wastes. This product works for me even with these issues! After a couple weeks with the toner applied every morning, I have had a lot less dirt coming out when I cleanse at night. It is also dramatic if you do have dirt in wiping it away. So it gets rid of dirt and keeps it that way!MOISTURIZING: I don\u2019t think I ever expected a toner to moisturize, I expect it to strip everything and then I put moisturizer on top\u2026. While I did use moisturizer most of the time with this toner, I didn\u2019t have to! I noticed it can be used as an all in 1. I have no idea how, a rarity when it doesn\u2019t seem very oily either\u2026 usually only an oil cleanser can do this but those make me breakout. Uniquely awesome that this product can cleanse and moisturize effectively and concurrently without unwanted results!SMELLS GREAT: the smell is pleasant and not harsh like toners can be. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s perfume or natural but it\u2019s close enough to natural I can live and love it!I know I wrote this review in the style of many non-American producers that sell here on amazon\u2026. I am American and just a regular 34 year old gal, I swear! White if that helps anyone imagine skin type\u2026.Just thought it would be more organized review this way, and I think the product is great so it warranted a good review. Thanks Eight Saints!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using eight saints for quite some time now. I have different toners I use religiously but decided to give this one a try. The first thing I really like is that it\u2019s a spray bottle. Typically I shake the toner onto my hands and apply but I am digging the spray nozzle. The scent of the toner isn\u2019t my favorite but certainly isn\u2019t overwhelming. The benefits from the ingredients and the difference in my skin texture are what\u2019s important to me. Oh, did I mention Eight Saints is all natural, not tested on animals and made in the USA??? I promise anything you try from this company, you will love!",
