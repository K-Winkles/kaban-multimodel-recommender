        "description": "SheaMoisture Even and Radiant Daily Exfoliating Toner Pads are made for melanin-rich skin to help clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells. Infused with natural Raw Honey, these gentle face pads feature an alcohol-free formula to help clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells. These daily face pads combine an exfoliator and a toner in a single-use pad. Use in the AM and PM. Use as step 2, following Even and Radiant Cleansing Balm. Start with clean, dry skin. Gently swipe one pad across the face and neck, avoiding the eye area. Allow to fully dry before following with Even and Radiant Dark Spot Correcting Serum, and ending with Even and Radiant Daily Face Lotion during the AM or Even and Radiant Night Cream during the PM. SheaMoisture Daily Exfoliating Toner Pads are part of the Even and Radiant skincare collection, which helps to visibly reduce the appearance of dark spots and post-acne spots while helping to restore skin's natural tone. Our skin care products are formulated with no parabens, no mineral oil, no phthalates, no fragrance, no petrolatum, and no animal testing. SheaMoisture is the legacy of Sofi Tucker, a pioneering mother of four and an entrepreneur, who sold Shea Butter, African Black Soap, and homemade beauty preparations in Sierra Leone in 1912. We honor her vision by continuing to formulate with Shea Butter handcrafted by women in Africa. With every purchase, you show support of our mission to reinvest back in our communities. Ethically traded ingredients, sustainably produced. Tested on the Tucker family for four generations. Never on animals.",

My skin actually feels moisturized afterwards, but not greasy or sticky.I only wish the pads were bigger. They are tiny in comparison to my other pads, and even in comparison to the jar size.

                "reviewText": "3.12.22~ The pads are small.More the size of a cotton round than a face pad.But at this price, suppose that's to be expected.The downside with a small pad is, if you have sun damage to your whole face,it's only enough for a few spots not face.Once you do cheeks & want to swipe neck, the pad is a ball.Does it work?Well, I use other products so hard to tell.The slight pad exfoliation seems to help & face feels very hydrated after.What I don't like, and didn't know at time of click was, this has bee products in it.Even though 'Shea Moisture' is traditionally Cruelty Free, using bees is not my thing.So my Eco self is conflicted & don't want to uspet the creatures that make our food.The bee product plus the small pads would make this a pass for me.Also a weird smell I can't identify & not a fan of.But at the price point, it is a nice option to smooth texture.",

I don\u2019t feel like they are too harsh on my skin and leave a really nice moisturized feeling. It has a light scent that vanishes once in use. The pads are very moist and the container has held them moister in well. One of my favorite items in my skin care line up.",

You can see the dirt on the cleansing pad. It would be great for daily exfoliating and bringing color to your cheeks.The ingredients initially feels itchy on my skin but it settles in after it dries.
