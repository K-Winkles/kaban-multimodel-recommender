                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not so sure about this product. I\u2019m amazed by how my skin quickly absorbed it, but it\u2019s oil. My face is oily enough and I\u2019m not sure how oil is supposed to keep the oil on my face down. An hour later, my nose started itching due to the excessive oil on it, and that part of my face produces the most oil. I had to return it quickly. I\u2019m giving it 3 stars, though. It might work for you, but definitely not if you have an oily skin.",

You need to combine it with Niacinamide which helps control sebum production and hydrates your skin that may have become dry due to the salicylic acid.- I would advise not to use this product as a solution to removing the oil from the skin (even if without acne), as it may dehydrate it completely and result in inflammation and redness. Use a face wash instead.- For whiteheads, the Niacinamide serum works better than this one. (Check out my review on Minimalist Niacinamide serum for more guidance)",
