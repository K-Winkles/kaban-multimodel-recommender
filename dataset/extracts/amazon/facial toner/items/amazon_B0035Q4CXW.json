Adding these pads to your skin care routine will leave you with smooth, soft, and fully refreshed clear skin. These Anti-Blemish pads contain salicylic acid, which effectively fight blemishes. This product also contains eucalyptus oil and menthol, which will allow you to feel the signature Noxzema refreshing tingle. When you feel the tingle, you know the product is working! The powerful pads remove excess oil and other impurities to leave your skin clean, fresh, and less susceptible to blemishes. How to Use: Clean the skin thoroughly before applying this product. Cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times daily. Because excessive drying of the skin may occur, start with one application daily, then gradually increase to two or three times daily if needed or as directed by a doctor. If bothersome dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or even every other day. Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. Experience the Noxzema difference with products that give your skin an invigorating fresh start and visibly clearer skin. Put your trust in a classic and get ready for refreshingly clean skin. Add this simple step to your skin care routine!",

                "reviewText": "These textured salicylic acid facial pads work better on my skin than all the others I've tried (Clean n Clear, Biore, etc.) so I'm giving them a 5-star rating. They actually have a rough feel to them, which seems to be more effective on my skin for removing dirt and oil. I tend to have very oily skin, so the gentler alcohol-free cleansing pads I have tried don't work as well for me.As other reviewers have noted, these pads have an EXTREMELY strong chemical odor. I hold my breath when I use them, wiping over my nose and chin area first, so it dries before I have to breath again haha. I usually fan my face when I inhale again so as not to breathe in the smell. Don't let it scare you, though, if you have very oily skin and don't always have the energy to wash and rinse your face with soap/liquid cleanser and water at the end of the day or first thing in the morning. I suppose it's probably better to actually wash your face at night before bed if you have makeup on, or if you sweat a lot at the gym or work in landscaping or whatever, but when I don't have the energy to do the full routine, I use these pads to remove residue and exfoliate before bed.Sometimes I use before a shower, as I rinse off the harsher chemicals immediately and follow with a gentle non-soap facial cleanser, to get the exfoliating pore-penetrating effects of the pads without the drying effects.",

                "reviewText": "I use these in conjunction with the Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream and my skin has finally stopped breaking out after a 5 year battle (late 20's to early 30's). I have tried EVERYTHING... a round of accutane, several rounds of antibiotics, the Acne.org Regimen, Retin-A, oil cleansing, tea tree oil, every over the counter product you can think of as well as every topical prescription the dermatologist could put me on and NOTHING worked. I was sooooo depressed about having such bad adult acne. I became a hermit and only left my house if I had too. I even started a business so that I could work from home! In the end, silly Noxzema products ended up being MY answer. Who would have thought?My regimen:AM: Wash off nightly mask of Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize, apply makeupPM: Wash off makeup with Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize. Before bed, apply a face mask of Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream (apply one thin coat, wait to dry, apply second thin coat). Before I go to sleep, product is dry, but greasy. I sleep with a towel on my pillow every night to keep my pillow case from becoming a greasy mess.I am now one month into this regimen. My skin completely stopped breaking out immediately. Pores were visibly reduced within 3 days and have continued to get smaller and/or disappear altogether. Hyperpigmentation is 50% better than from when I started. My skin has not become dry and/or flaky at any point, BUT I was using Retin-A prior to starting this regimen, so my skin was very used to harsh products being used on it.I hope this helps someone!",
