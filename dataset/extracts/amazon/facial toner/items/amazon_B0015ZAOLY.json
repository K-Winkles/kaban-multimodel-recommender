                "reviewText": "I have never been a believer in toners since I've always used alcohol based toners and they have just made my skin worse. I have dry, sensitive and textured skin. I purchased a sample size of this and fell in love! I then purchased the full size. It has a short list of wonderful, natural ingredients. It is extremely gentle, soothing and gives a cooling sensation. It takes off the last traces of makeup. I apply some on a cotton pad and just swipe it over my face. It has also gradually reduced the textured bumps on my skin - which I didn't think was possible! I also love the dispenser. It comes with a lift up nozzle which dispenses the product drop by drop and the amount increases as you squeeze the bottle. This really helps in using the exact amount of product needed for each use. If you have the same skin issues as I do, definitely give this a try.P.S: If you're on the fence about this, see if Sephora has their 10$ deals on Mario Badescu skincare samples (4 bottles of 1 oz. each). There's a good amount of product in there that you can use it for a few weeks and truly see the results. Plus you might enjoy the other products in there because Mario Badescu is a fabulous skincare line!",

My order arrived within 4 days and the shipment included several free samples, about a $30 value and a cute wellmade travel tote! I tried the Seaweed Face toner because I have really sensitive skin and Rosacae, I love the smell, in that it has very little/extra light scent unlike my recent attempts at using Neutrogena's pungent smelling stuff. This toner doesn't burn or sting, it is cooling after thoroughly washing and patting the face dry I applied this liberally and it feels really clean and comfortable. I will now follow up with the Mario Badescu Control Cream. Excellent products, Excellent Service, really reasonably priced for such high quality skincare. I will definitely be ordering again from this Seller.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 30, with combination skin that gets quite oily on the t-zone and irritatingly tight around the mouth and cheeks. This is the only toner I've found that's soothing and mild enough to use throughout the year; not to mention being really effective at keeping my skin feeling cleansed and refreshed. I can't say how effective this alone has been at reducing pore size; given that I follow a pretty regular exfoliation routine along with nightly retinol application. But I'm on my third bottle now and have had no reactions or sensitivity. It has a very mild herbal fragrance which would be the seaweed I suppose. It's not really a 'lotion' but has a watery consistence; like rose water. All in all, I'm very happy with it and it's become one of my HG products. Plus, the price is really worth it considering that it lasts 4-5 months easily (for me).",
