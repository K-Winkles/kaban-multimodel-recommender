                "reviewText": "I've never used a facial toner before, but as I get a little older, I'm trying to do more to maintain a youthful appearance, or at least avoid looking prematurely old by the time I'm in my late 40s or 50s. So, among other things, I decided to start using this facial toner, which is apparently specially designed for men.As I learned by minimal research, toner is supposed to provide an extra layer of cleaning after washing your face, removing anything left behind. It can improve pores, particularly for aging skin. I'm getting toward my late 30s, so I'm aware that my skin may need some extra support. I use this after using a face wash (post-shower) either once or twice a day by putting a small amount on a cotton ball and rubbing it around most of my face, avoiding my eyes. Avoiding eyes is important, since witch hazel could cause some irritation (even if it's far milder than alcohol, for example). Mostly, it feels pleasant and seems to leave my skin that little bit cleaner. If I've just shaved, it may sting ever so slightly, but not even to the point of unpleasantness.The truth is, I've used this alongside a new face wash, and after applying this, I use some beard oil and face cream. It's hard to say which is the main thing that has made a difference, but I have noticed (and more importantly, my wife has noticed) that the skin of my face is softer, has fewer signs of blemish or irritation, and looks better in general. So, as a part of my routine, this has definitely been a great addition. In that way, I can recommend it easily!",

This Mens Face Toner by Natural Outcome Skincare comes in a 236ml bottle. The natural, alcohol-free ingredients in this formula are fantastic. It's got witch hazel, aloe vera, cucumber, sage, yarrow, and more. The scent is one of my favorite things about this formula. It's a beautiful, yummy scent that is natural and not overpowering.After I wash my face, I just put a little amount on a flat cotton pad and wipe my face with it. I can feel working almost immediately. It has just the right amount of astringency. It cleans and tightens pores really well. My skin gets a little reddish at first but then quickly recovers its normal complexion and looks refreshed. My skin feels well-prepped for serums and moisturizers to pamper it further. Overall, this is my favorite skin toner for men. I just hope it comes back in stock. Full marks from me!",

I never spend this much on my own toner so I'm kind of hoping my son gets bored and I get to use it.",

From forehead to around the nose and cheeks, this leaves me skin feeling clean and tight. I can definitely feel the astringent effect. If you have stubble, it makes it a little more difficult on the cotton pad, but that's a minor issue.The ingredients in this product are all things we recognize and I feel very confident I'm not applying something harmful to my skin. Witch Hazel, Aloe leaf juice, cucumber and lemon peel extracts, just reading he ingredients makes me want to use this. Apply moisturizing spray and then any serums and creams after this.love it.",

I've been using this toner once a day for the last two weeks. I think I may start using it twice a day and see how my skin fares as I've noticed a nice decrease in how oily my skin is.Once this bottle is finished I intend to purchase another, and that should speak for itself! I think I've added to my skincare routine. If you find that your skin is oily then I would definitely recommend giving this a shot.",
