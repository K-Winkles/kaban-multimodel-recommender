I think the pads are rough enough to clean without irritating the skin, at least for me.The other thing I liked is that they come with little thongs inside the jar cover, so you can get the pads individually without using your hand. This is a great way to promote good hygiene with this kind of product.After using it, I did feel my skin softer and cleaner, and it was a pleasure doing the treatment with that beautiful, refreshing smell.Hopefully, I\u2019ll see great results after I keep using the pads.",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I did receive this item for free to try out. HOWEVER! All opinions are my own and I pride myself on unbiased reviews that can help others decide whether something is worth it.Made in Korea! Ugh Korean skincare products are always designed SO BEAUTIFULLY. It\u2019s just soooo aesthetically pleasing!!! The container these pads come in is SOOOO nice. It feels super lux. Completely tamper-proof with the box having tape you have to cut through and this container itself you have to unscrew and then break the seal which also keeps this super fresh and moist. This container has a pop top lid and on the underside of the lid they provided just the cutest transparent mini tongs for you to use and pluck a toner pad out with. It\u2019s SOOO nice and guarantees you don\u2019t dirty the pads by using your fingers to dig in there. If your fingers aren\u2019t completely clean and you dig in there you risk contamination and bacteria breeding. It\u2019s really great that they thought of this! Supposedly this will skin brighten along with all the other amazinq qualities of a toner pad such as cleansing and removing oils and blackhead and other gross things.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LISTING ITSELF! The container has minimal English instructions and it\u2019s honestly not too great lol. The listing teaches you to use the rougher side of the pad to wipe away dead skin cells and to use the smoother/softer side to wipe areas with white/blackheads and it would smooth out your skin. I had no idea until I read it on the actual Amazon listing, they never mentioned it on the box. The pad indeed does have a rough side and a softer smooth side that I didn\u2019t know what it was lol.These have a very light pleasant scent. It feels very cooling and nice on my skin and it feels really nice when I\u2019m wiping/cleansing my face with it. I\u2019m really enjoying these cleaning pads!",

                "reviewText": "First of all, the container is really nice. I'll want to find another use for it once the toner pads are gone. The pads have a pretty rough texture, so there's definitely exfoliating going on with each use. These do seem to leave my skin very clean. My skin is on the dry side, not oily, so I am probably not the target audience. I just really wanted to clear up the few blackheads where my nose meets my cheek. These seem to be working for that. I apply a hyaluronic acid serum while my skin is still damp from the toner and my skin is responding very well to that. These do not seem to irritate my skin, nor do they cause dryness. I do like them, but the cost is pretty high compared to cotton rounds and a bottle of toner. I will probably save these for travel now that I've given them a good try; not because they aren't good, but because they are a bit expensive at around 40 cents per pad.",

                "reviewText": "I was actually surprised with these pads. I hadn't expected them to be quite as effective as they were.The pads (60 in all) come in a very nice jar that is also the dispenser. You get a tiny pair of mini tweezers to pick them up with, and separate them. The tweezers stay on the inner lid.The pads themselves are very different from any others I had seen, or used. They are made of a very open weave material, like a thick cheesecloth. It seems to be more aggressive at removing dirt, oil and sebum... the things that cause blackheads.I have some areas on my nose that have fairly open pores, and they tend to develop blackheads. It was the perfect spot to test these pads. The pads are very saturated in the liquid that washes out the pores. Far more than other pads. They are also large pads. I'm accustomed to the pads that are popular in the US, which frankly are not effective, at all.These pads really did a good job. I felt as though the skin was cleaner, but I had to prove it to myself.I have one of those blackhead \"sucker\" machines, that is handheld. It actually pulls out the blackheads using suction. Though I dislike using it, it does seem to deep clean. Plus, you can see what it has removed from the skin.In my case after using the suction device there was barely anything left to pull out. This was really surprising, but also impressive.I thought that this was a bit pricey for a 60 day supply, but I was comparing to what was available retail in the US. Those products are relatively ineffective.This really worked well, and now I'm convinced that it's well worth the price. It has a nice, though a bit unusual scent. Not very strong, but pleasant.",
