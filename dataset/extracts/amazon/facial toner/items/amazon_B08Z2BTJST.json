Another thing I absolutely love about this serum is my skin is so much softer and the elasticity has improved! I think it\u2019s because this product really helps my skin retain moisture. I put it on every night after I wash my face when my face is still a little damp. It\u2019s a lightweight thin gel that\u2019s really easy to apply and you only need a little bit. It absorbs very quickly. I follow that up with an eye cream and a moisturizer. I use Eight Saints All In eye cream and Eight Saints Up The Anti night cream. I love Eight Saints products because they use natural and organic ingredients, they don\u2019t test on animals and they actually WORK! I feel like these 3 are the perfect combination for waking up with soft and healthy looking skin.",

The hyaluronic acid hydrates my skin, and the vitamin C and green tea give my skin a sun-kissed radiant glow! This serum also makes my pores appear invisible. I usually follow this with the Eight Saints Chase the Sun SPF moisturizer, which also is amazing.

Pep Rally is a light weight, fast absorbing, lightly scented serum that delivers as promised. I have been using this serum twice a day for 12 days and can feel and see a difference. My skin is hydrated and my fine lines are disappearing. It has a very light and pleasant scent and absorbs quickly. This serum is now part of my daily routine. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn\u2019t expecting to be impressed with this serum given the modest price but I\u2019m delightfully surprised! This Eight Saints serum is incredibly moisturizing and adds firmness to my skin instantly. It\u2019s a true serum, so you still need to use a moisturizer. I pair this with Renew Me from FRE and they work well together to give my skin a clean, matte/non-greasy, firm texture. It absorbs instantly into the skin leaving no residue or stickiness. I haven\u2019t used it long enough to know whether it reduces dark spots, but on its texture and early results alone I\u2019m sold!",

I'm so obsessed with these products because they do not hurt my sensitive skin and they work really well. This stuff is cooling and refreshing when you put it in. It has a light scent and absorbs quickly into your skin. My skin feels smoother and I'm noticing some reduction in my wrinkles on my forehead. Definitely will buy again!",

                "reviewText": "Recently, I visited a local salon for a facial. It was a wonderful experience. My skin felt and looked amazing. The esthetician gave me a list of the products that she used on my skin. The total cost of those products (in the salon) was well over $500. Instead of purchasing the products, I decided to research products with the same ingredients to see if I could find more reasonably priced alternatives.Happily, I found Eight Saints. The ingredients in the Pep Rally Face Serum were so close to the pricey serum that the esthetician used on my face. I used the Pep Rally Face Serum after using Eight Saint\u2019s Coast Is Clear Face Toner. I found the serum so lightweight and effective. My skin quickly soaked it up. Just a little was enough. It felt very moisturizing and so refreshing. My skin felt good and looked brighter. I also felt like the product was an excellent value for the price. It was so much less expensive that the serum the esthetician recommended and I liked the feel of it even better.I look forward to trying out other Eight Saints products. Love!",

                "reviewText": "I love many of the Eight Saints products but the Pep Rally serum was a surprise to me on the performance. The texture, weight and clean fragrance of the serum makes it a joy to smooth over face. I have mature combination skin and it plumps the skin filling in fine lines and therefore makes a great primer before makeup, also on days with no makeup. It provides enough moisture that lasts, however the way it smooths the texture of the skin is incomparable to any other product I\u2019ve tried.The ingredients list is pure and natural with some excellent potent ingredients. This is one favorite facial product I can\u2019t live without!It\u2019s not meant to be a deeper nighttime moisturizer, it\u2019s meant for lighter daytime wear - for that it\u2019s excellent.",
