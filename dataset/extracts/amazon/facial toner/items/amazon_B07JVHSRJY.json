                "reviewText": "This product is pretty nice. The ingredients are something I always look at when buying products so having a product that isn't full of unnecessary ingredients is great. I like the spray bottle style. It took me a bit to get used to, but it's much easier and quicker than toners that require application with a cotton pad. I mist my face after getting out of the shower, and at night after washing my face before bed. It has a pleasant sent and feels nice misting the face. I have been using this product on and off for a few weeks now a long with a couple other new products so it's hard to tell how just this is affecting my face, but I skin has been looking nicer lately with my new regiment. I've also sprayed this over my damp hair by my scalp and worked it into the skin. My hair was very nice and soft and didn't get greasy at all which usually happens after a day of work. I'm hoping to experiment more with this product on its own to see how it helps my oily skin without other products, so far it seems to be working very nicely though.",

I had been throwing everything at it in hopes one of the endless line of products would work they way they promised on the label, but it was all for not. Until I took a chance on your 5.5 pH balancing hydrating and calming toner. Honestly, by now even my attitude stunk...lol. As I was applying this toner I said \"one more thing that probably doesn't work, just another waste of money\". I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I felt my skin relax, it felt perfect, it was truly balanced. No additional pimples the next day, & the ones I had started to heal. Over the course of a week, my face was in love with your product. I have been buying it since. Halleluiah!",
