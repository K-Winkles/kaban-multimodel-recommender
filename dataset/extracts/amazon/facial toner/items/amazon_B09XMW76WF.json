I\u2019ll keep using it to see if it makes any drastic changes to my skin. As far as the scent, it\u2019s not harsh at all, subtle for people who have allergies and are sensitive to harsh smells. Also very gentle for sensitive skin, I would derma plan my entire face and then after apply my toner to start my skincare routine and after shaving and exfoliating my face it doesn\u2019t even sting or burn my skin. It also doesn\u2019t dry out your face like other toners do, you will still feel moisturizer with it feeling like it dried your face up. I recommend you try this product.",
