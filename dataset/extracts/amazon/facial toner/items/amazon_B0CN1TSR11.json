I was expecting another typical skincare product that touts all its benefits and makes me feel like I\u2019m failing my skin by not using it and 10 other products\u2026.this was not the case. This comes in a sleek box with firm black cardboard insert, with the bottle a dark, deep purple, nearly black. It is gloriously simple with just the brand, the item name on the front, and the saying \u2018I am Full of Greatness\u2019 in English and in French on the back. Once opened, there is a removable little plug that makes it much less likely to drip or spill out (as I was about to take a photo of it, I realized I cannot find that little plug =( I wish there were another way to secure that little hole). The toner itself has the best scent I have smelled for a while - just the light hint of sweetness and lychee\u2026.incredible! The scent just lingers for a little while and is so wonderful. The feel of the toner is lovely and smooth without crossing the line to oily. I\u2019ve added this to my daily regimen and will update as needed.",

The presentation of the product is pretty - Love the bottle!! It does smell nice too.I have used this 4 times now and I haven't noticed anything different with my skin - honestly not sure what toner does - maybe smooths out skin? I guess I need to use it longer to see if it makes a bigger difference. What I can say is it did not dry my skin out or cause any reaction - I would call that a win! $25 for the bottle seems kind of average, plus being made by a \"celebrity\" probably adds to the cost.",

Elf beauty puts out quality product, but their products are much more affordable than this. it's a pretty decent toner with a light scent to it, but it's not anything super special in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "On the box it touts the fact that it's unscented, but also brags about being scented. So I get the distinct impression that the creators of this product weren't really doing much in terms of quality control or focus on detail. It also tells you to repeat your daily affirmation while using it, but didn't give me any details as to what that might be.It's a lotion. It feels hydrating. Works alright.",

Smells great without being an overpowering scent, leaves my skin feeling in a great state to follow up with a serum and moisturizer.",

                "reviewText": "Keys Soulcare Tranquil Essence is packaged impressively with a sleek bottle design. It just looks and feels as if it should be luxurious. Unfortunately, its contents did not live up to that luxury. I am not a fan of the fragrance, which I found to be unpleasant and to the point of being a tad overpowering. As such, I used a very minimal amount to test out during its first application . . . and I was decidedly underwhelmed. It did a whole lot of nothing, except leave behind a scent that my pup seemed intent on trying to clean off me. With subsequent applications, I used considerably more, which seemed to have a mild hydrating effect but not by much. Additionally, it left behind a tacky, almost gritty texture to the skin. The overall effectiveness of Keys Soulcare Tranquil Essence facial toner is questionable. I will look elsewhere for my facial toner needs.",
