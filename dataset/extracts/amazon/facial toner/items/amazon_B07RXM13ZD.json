                "reviewText": "Do NOT buy the bigger bottle. I have gone through several bottles of this over the last couple years. I decided to get the bigger size to save myself a few cents per Oz. Big mistake. The larger bottle is plastic instead of glass like the smaller one. The plastic bottle one was RANCID. I sent it back and bought another large (plastic) bottle thinking it was a fluke.. nope. Rancid again. Sent it back and ordered my usual small, glass 4oz bottle.. PERFECT! Smells great. Very refreshing and hydrating.",

I do a few squirts at the end of my routine and while at first it feels very wet, it dries very quick.I don't think this would be my go-to choice for setting makeup as it does leave my face rather wet for a minute and I don't think that would work well for my powder foundation.",
