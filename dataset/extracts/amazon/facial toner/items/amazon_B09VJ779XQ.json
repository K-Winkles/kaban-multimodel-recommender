                "reviewText": "I bought this for my oldest teen, he's in that lazy phase where he doesn't want to wash his face as often as he should. I'm hoping putting a little product on a cotton ball will be simple enough he might actually follow through. I tried it myself and it was a pretty pleasant experience. The scent wasn't overwhelming, just slightly medicinal. I was afraid it would be overly drying as most acne washes are, but it left my skin feeling soft and clean. I can't speak to it's long term acne curing affects, but I think it will be successful.",
