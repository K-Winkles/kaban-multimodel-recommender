The cocokind box it comes in was completely soaked (luckily the box was wrapped in plastic so the shipping box wasn't affected). But, the bottle was not broken and I haven't had any leaks since. Second reason for 4 stars is I feel this is overpriced for the size. You can purchase organic rosewater for half the price at Whole Foods and other grocery stores. Not sure this is worth the price plus shipping.That being said, it is a very nice toner for sensitive skin. I also use it to cleanse in the mornings after I splash my face with water (I don't use cleansers in the morning). My skin doesn't break out or have any adverse reaction to this (most other toners cause my face to fill up with blemishes, redness, irritation, etc).This also has a VERY strong and earthy rose scent which I personally don't mind. But if you're not into the smell of rosewater, you're not going to like this product.",

                "reviewText": "I love this toner. I've used it as a make-up remover (works great and gets all eye make-up) as well as an after-shower clarifying toner for breakouts. The scent is light and clean without being overpowering and the tiny bottle lasts a long time thanks to it being a misting-type spray that I can put right on a cotton pad. I love how gentle it is on my skin, but thorough. I would recommend this to anyone with any skin type. It's perfectly balanced and no issues on sensitive skin like mine.",

                "reviewText": "My akin has changed ever since using this product! I wouldn't say it's clear, I get stress acne... But it's quite moisturizing and is effective at toning. My face feels balanced after spritzing on after a cleansing. It smells really nice! Kind of like lychee. I bkught this as an alternative to 100% Pure's discontinued one and I've been supporting this brand ever since. The amount of product you get is actually pretty decent for the price point. The only qualm I have is for the spray nozzle. It releases too much product in a clumsy manner, so I just spray it on my clean hands and pat it onto my face. I know msny use cotton pads but I find they absorb too much.",
