                "reviewText": "IT TAKES YOUR SKIN 30 DAYS TO GET USED TO ANY KIND OF SKIN PRODUCTI've seen far too many reviews where people say something along the lines of \"used for 2 weeks, made my skin worse.\" However, if you have done any research about chemical exfoliants you'd know it takes a while for your skin to get used to these types as products and this results in purge acne. The cool thing about purge acne is it is all pimples you were already going to get! That's right, chemical exfoliants speed up the process of clearing out those pores. After the purge acne has completed, you are left with soft, supple skin that will never ever have to see any kind of damaging face scrub again. Seriously though, physical exfoliants (face scrub) just damage the skin leading to more acne. If you love your friends, you'll tell them to quit using anything with chunks, sugar or dreaded microplastics in it and to get this stuff. End rant, on the the official review.I love this stuff! I live in a high altitude and dry area and finding a toner that didn't make my face feel tight was everything. Along with acne prone skin made worse by dryness, this stuff has truly been a miracle for my skin. I use it twice a day and have had the smoothest, least irritated skin of my life. Highly recommend!",
