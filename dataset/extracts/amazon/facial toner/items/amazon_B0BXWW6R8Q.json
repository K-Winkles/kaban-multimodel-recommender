So far, this toner is working far better on my skin than many toners I've used. It's clear and virtually fragrance free (there is a slight scent that dissipates on application).When applied with a cotton pad, the toner goes on smooth and does not leave a sticky residue. Instead it leaves skin feeling soft and refreshed; not tight or stripped of its natural oils either.They're also not kidding when they say that this product is exfoliating! I had a mildly flaky area on my chin, so I was thinking that I needed to exfoliate, but this toner did the job all by iteself! It left the skin smooth and irritation free. It's a very soothing experience. Additionally, the more you use the product, the softer your skin feels! I rubbed a few drops on my hands and pressed them into my face and that did seal in extra moisture. You can tells this toner is hyaluronic acid based. I just love it!As for the skin plumping, I didn't see any difference immediately after I used the toner, BUT I noticed a difference as soon as I applied my moisturizers. They went on extra silky and I could see a difference in smoother, even plumper skin that was really well primed for foundation. Reaaally Great!I'm going to store this in the fridge for that extra spa-like effect! A+",

                "reviewText": "IT'S SKIN V7 Hyaluronic Toner | Hyaluronic Acid Toner for Face w/PHA & 7 Types of Vitamins | Korean Skin Care Toner for Dry Skin | Hydrating Toner for Face Skin Care (Pack of 1, 5.07 Fl oz.)Hydrating toner in cute packaging for everyday use. I\u2019ve always done the Korean multi step skincare, and this product fits right after cleansing. Before applying all the serum and moisturizer.Includes:- Hyaluronic acid: for moisturizing- PHA (gluconolactone): for exfoliation- 7 Vitamin Complex: B1 Thiamine HCI, B2 Riboflavin, B3 Niacinamide, B5 Pantothenic Acid, B6 Pyridoxine, B9 Folic Acid, and B12 Cyanocobalamine. Not sure how it exactly works, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s what giving this product that Flintstone vitamin scent.- Free from 10 harmful substances- Free of synthetic scents & colorsInstructions:- Toner: Wet a cotton pad with product, then wipe along the skin. Reapply as needed- Maximize Moisturizing Effect (like a face mask): Wet 4-6 cotton pads, place on areas as needed- Better Absorption: When applying by hand, warm up your clean hands first. Then apply product to hands and slowly press your face with the heat generated from your palms. Apply light pressure to improve absorption.For now, I feel the extra bit of hydration. Since it is replacing my previous product, I would say equivalent moisturizing effect as a product 20x the cost. It\u2019s a clean feeling product, and there\u2019s no tightness afterwards. Product has not been sitting on a shelf for months, and plenty of time per expiration stamp.",

                "reviewText": "I liked this, but it's not my favorite toner I have tried from the It's Skin brand. It's watery in texture and absorbs really quickly. It leaves skin feeling comfortable, even without wearing moisturizer. The skin feels supple after applying this and it provides a slight glow. If you are someone who doesn't want evidence of your skincare products after applying them, you'll love this. Personally I prefer the Nutrition Toner from their collagen line. That makes my skin feel full and plump. It's really just what you prefer. Smell wise, this had a vitamin smell and reminded me of those Emergen-C drink packets if you have ever tried those. I don't apply toner with a cotton pad because I think that wastes a ton of product. Instead I apply with my bare hands and pat the product into my face. I liked this, but it didn't blow me away.",
