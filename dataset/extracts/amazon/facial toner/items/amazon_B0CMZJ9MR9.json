                "reviewText": "I love K-Beauty because they are so affordable and their products are effective. Previously tried the Mist Essence from this Retinol Vitamin C & E line. This is not going to differ too much from that feedback since it\u2019s so similar. Really like a majority of the ingredients used in the formula. It\u2019s packed with humectants, emollients, antioxidants and soothing ingredients. I prefer to apply Vitamin C based products during the day and keep Retinol based products for my night routine. Because of both ingredients being at such a low percentage I\u2019m not concerned about the negative aspects that can sometimes occur. The Cica/Centella has the higher concentration so this is the main focus for me when it comes to the formula and when to use it. Toner arrived in the original box. Safety seal under the twist off lid was still attached. Bottle is a thicker plastic that is transparent. Dispensing is through a small hole within the inner seal. Have to give it a good shake or else it slowly drips one small drop at a time. Toner is thin with a water consistency, will run down your wrist or face if you\u2019re not careful. No bothersome scent. Glides along and presses easily on skin. Formula is lightweight so it\u2019s not going to feel heavy after applying, does a tacky after-feel once fully absorbed. Tackiness goes away after layering with next product. Base of the Toner gives instant hydration, especially along areas that need the extra moisture. I reach for this when I\u2019m wanting to target hydration and calming my skin. Has been worth the price point.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait a bit to review this, skin care is hard to tell unless you use it long term. But, after a week of use, I feel like I can give a good idea of the product at least.The first thing I noticed about this toner is that there is no smell, which is a plus for me. I cannot stand the witchhazel smell or overly bright citrus most toners I have used have.The consistency is very light, applied on a cotton pad it goes on smooth and feels refreshing. It also does pick up some additional residue my cleaner leaves behind, so that's good.I use it daily after washing and before my serums, then moisturizer. It doesn't sting, or leave my skin dry, which is nice.Again, it takes longer than a week to notice any difference in skin tone and texture, so not sure how the long term results will be. But overall really happy to have added this to my routine.",

                "reviewText": "This order came with a large bottle of facial toner.So, I\u2019ve recently gotten into facial skin treatments. I\u2019ve been wanting to take better care of my skin, so I added this facial skin toner to my nightly routine. It has retinol and vitamin C, which I\u2019m told are great for reducing wrinkles, which is what I\u2019m trying to do with my face. So far, I think the combination of my serum and this toner are working well. My skin appears to be very plump and vibrant. It seems to have reduced the lines around my mouth and eyes. The only thing I think may be happening is, with these new products on my face, I believe that my skin is becoming a little bit dry in places, but that\u2019s fine. I can just moisturize. The toner has no scent I can detect, and it almost feels like rubbing the juice from a citrus fruit onto my face. Not unpleasant! Honestly, I\u2019m really happy with this toner, and I hope that my face continues to stay looking young and healthy.",

                "reviewText": "Used the toner for a while, but did not see any noticeable skin tone or texture difference. My skin has a red undertone and I have relatively small pores. I used this after cleansing and before any other products, but really didn't see any visible change. It didn't have any odor (which is what I wanted) and the packaging was sharp, directions clear. The product just didn't do anything to my skin that made me want to purchase it again.",

I just have to put moisturizer on. This is an all-in-one after I wash my face. It feels really good on my face. My skin does not break out and I am impressed since it is sensitive.",

                "reviewText": "After not being able to use retinol during my pregnancy, I was looking forward to trying out a new brand because the last one I used changed their formula. This one is fantastic; it even has vitamin C! Korean products are usually great and do not damage the skin. I would just be careful and regularly use sunscreen. I use this toner every day and I noticed how my pimples have been going away faster. It also leaves my face with a natural glow. I would recommend this toner to people who do not have sensitive skin and are looking for a more powerful toner that provides more benefits.",
