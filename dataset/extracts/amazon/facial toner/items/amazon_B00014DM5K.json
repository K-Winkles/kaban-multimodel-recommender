I have to say it has almost become addicting! I cannot sleep until my face is clean and I don't feel fresh in the morning till I have used my toner. I cannot find this in stores near me anymore so I tried another similar toner (another brand) and it left a film on my face! This toner does not do that, you feel clean and refreshed. It is not over-drying (I have very dry skin) and it have evened out my skin tone soo much! I am fair skinned with lots of freckles and sun damage. After using this for about 8-9 months I don't have to wear foundation anymore! I put on a tinted moisturizer, some concealer under the eyes and I am good to go! LOVE IT",

Makes my dry/combination skin feel refreshed before putting on makeup. Most of all, it does not leave me with dry patches! Since my skin is mostly dry, I'm prone to scaly skin during the winter months. This is a very hydrating toner packed with healing aloe vera that not only refreshes but moisturizes the skin and cleans out dirty pores. I even mix this toner with some almond oil to use as a makeup remover! Very safe, very natural (you can also find it at Sprout's grocery store) and perfect pre-primer toner for a day out. I blot some of this onto a cotton round pad or two and use circular motions on my face AND neck. Thanks for the great product.",

This toner doesn't dry out your skin like other toners and it smells great. I do feel that it works a bit different than the orginal bottle I had but the bottle was very old. Perhaps they updated their formula.Pros- moisturizing unlike any other toner- actually smells decent- works wonders on my bumpy skin- evens out my complexion- drys quickCons- the lid of bottle sometimes gets crusted but I am messy when administering the toner- it seems a bit different than the orginal bottle I had",

Any slightly nefarious ingredients, especially alcohol, will leave my face red and irritated, so I was happy to finally find a toner that my skin likes. At night I use it after washing my face and it removes the last residue in a very satisfying way. Somehow it really does 'prepare' the skin in a way that makes moisturizer more effective. Sometimes I use it mid-day in place of washing to remove some oil from my face. Adding this toner to my routine seems to help manage my acne.",

                "reviewText": "I used to use this product for over 30 years and it was great. It had a very pleasant natural smell. This new version is absolutely disgusting! It has a very strong chemical perfume smell. Why have they ruined a great product?",

                "reviewText": "When I worked at Whole Foods, Earth Balance products came very highly recommended from folks in the Whole Body department and I couldn't agree more. If you have sensitive skin, the natural ingredients will not irritate like other brands. Their products are more than what you would spend for other brands, but it is well worth it and a little bit of the toner goes and long way--and it smells awesome! I have been without the toner for a couple months and just reordered and my skin has definitely looked a little under the weather, so I am excited to use it again!",

                "reviewText": "The smell of most beauty products cause my sinuses to swell like an emergency raft. No such problem with this toner. I have combination skin that tends to be dryer in the winter, and it doesn't help that Texas is so windy and dusty. This is the first toner I have ever used, but it seems to be everything I could want in a toner. My lotion is finally penetrating my skin instead of floating on top or drying up, the ingredients aren't toxic and the price is right. I also recently began using Earth Science'a a-d-e cleanser on my face instead of Dr Bronner's miracle soap, and that is also helping me combat my mild winter dryness. I still use Dr. Bronner's as my 'everything else' soap. Seriously check that stuff out.",

It freshens up my face and makes my skin feel hydrated, like a cold glass of water does to the body. I rarely use moisturiser anymore as the toner freshens me up every time.",
