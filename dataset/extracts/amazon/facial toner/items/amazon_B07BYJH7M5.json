The compact size is perfect for travel, and it's gentle on my sensitive skin. It's refreshing with a subtle cucumber scent, and the toner left my skin feeling refreshed.While the toner is refreshing, I deducted one star for its effectiveness. It didn't meet all my expectations for toning. However, the natural ingredients and gentle formula are still appealing aspects of this product. I would also add that the trial size lasted a few weeks and maybe it would take a bit more than that to actually notice the effectiveness.",

If you Buy It Again, or buy from Essentials you pay 2x as much.Product itself has always been great, I'm speaking to the deceptive practice of same labeling, same shape, being misleading for an online sale.5 stars for the product 1star for deceptive size & pricing",

Limpia muy bien la piel, no irrita, se siente s\u00faper fresco y el aroma a lavanda es muy s\u00fatil y refrescante. Sin duda se queda en mi rutina y comprar\u00e9 la versi\u00f3n que es m\u00e1s grande. Me encant\u00f3 porque ayud\u00f3 a afinar la textura de mi piel, estaba ya desesperada por tanta espinilla.
