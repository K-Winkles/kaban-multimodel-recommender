                "reviewText": "I bought this because I felt like I needed a deeper cleansing step of my skincare routine aside from my cleanser. I\u2019ve been religiously using this toner every night for the past few months and this has really helped even out my skin tone and brighten it. I don\u2019t break out much, but when I do, this gets rid of the pimples relatively quickly and does a good job of evening out any scarring that happens. The scent is a pretty mild witch hazel scent (which makes sense since it\u2019s the third ingredient) that isn\u2019t overwhelming at all.I have sensitive skin so I was a little afraid that this would irritate my skin but I\u2019ve had no issues. My dry skin seems to really enjoy the added hydration and the price is really reasonable for how big of a bottle you\u2019re getting. I use this every night and pair it with a moisturizing toner, and it does wonders for my skin!The only issue I have is the dispensing method, which is a Press cap that pours out the toner. I\u2019m not sure if others have had this issue but it tends to spill all over the cap and once it dries, it crystalizes and makes the cap all sticky. Instead, I just take the whole cap off and pour it straight from the opening onto a reusable cotton pad. The toner still spills a bit but nothing too crazy, so I just have to wipe down the opening every now and then.Aside from that, it has certainly become a regular in my skincare routine and I will be buying again once I run out!",
