            "Hydration: Bulgarian rose oil is known for its moisturizing properties. A rose-infused tonic can help provide an extra layer of hydration to your skin, leaving it feeling soft and supple. Soothing: Rose oil has natural properties that can help calm and soothe irritated or sensitive skin. Using a rose-infused tonic may help reduce redness and discomfort.",

            "Prepares for Further Skincare: Applying a moisturizing tonic before serums and moisturizers helps prepare the skin to better absorb subsequent products, allowing them to work more effectively. Antioxidant Protection: Roses are rich in antioxidants, which can help protect the skin from environmental stressors like pollution and UV radiation, potentially reducing the signs of aging.",

Gentle Refreshment: Applying a moisturizing tonic throughout the day can provide a gentle refreshment to your skin, especially in dry or air-conditioned environments."
