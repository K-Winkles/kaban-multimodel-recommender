Retinol, (or the natural version Bakuchiol,) Niacinamide, Hyaluronic acid & a lot more! Definitely check out the ingredient list. I love that it\u2019s all in one.I\u2019ve been wanting to go more natural, clean, non toxic & chemical free so I\u2019ve loved finally getting to try bakuchiol, which is the the natural, plant based version retinol, but is just as powerful. Another thing I appreciate is that this toner is good for acne prone skin & that it\u2019s alcohol free. Also the fact that it\u2019s pore refining, because that\u2019s something that\u2019s important for me to have in a toner.It\u2019s helped my redness and break outs, my skin has looked a lot more clear since I\u2019ve started using it. It helps my pores appear smaller while making my face feel smoother. Definitely on my must have list",

It\u2019s perfect for those with sensitive skin, as it doesn\u2019t contain any harmful ingredients and is light on the skin. An all natural scent, with amazing ingredients you can read! I\u2019ve been using this alongside their moisturizer & it\u2019s been the perfect duo in bringing my dry skin back to life! The only con is the sprayer has the product come out FAST, I do wish it was more of a mist than a stream. But if you hold it far enough back, you can avoid that. Isn\u2019t a big deal because I love the toner so much! Add this one into your routine!",

                "reviewText": "I recently turned 35 and started noticing enlarged pores and I tried out this product because it was plantbased and cruelty free. I never heard of Bakuchiol so I was curious what benefits it has in store for my skin! I began using daily for 3 weeks and noticed visibly brighter skin, tighter and glowing as well! After a long day out in the sun I spray this on my face and follow with the facial moisturizer cream and the redness goes away and skin is glowing and being nourished as well! Definitely try this out!!!",

Retinol makes my skin super dry and patchy, but I didn\u2019t experience that with this natural alternative. I didn\u2019t have a toner in my current face routine and I\u2019ve enjoyed adding this in a few times a week. As always, I recommend doing a patch test before use! Overall, I like this product and it has not caused any problems. I will say my face feels better and overall appearance has improved as well. My only suggestion for the future would be a sprayer that has a finer mist!",

Maybe its the dryness of spending the winter in the desert, but i think my skin looks great after the Beauty by Earth products!Love the products so much, will be buying more!",

I like the way this toner cleans dirt off my face while also making my pours appear smaller. My face gets oily easily and breaks out and also gets clogged with dirt a lot throughout the day. This helps clean all that off and I also use it to take my makeup off at night, it leaves my face feeling soft. Will definitely buy again. Also has a fruity scent to it that smells great.",
