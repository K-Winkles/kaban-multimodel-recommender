These micelles have a lipophilic core that attract oil and impurities. How to Use Apply to a cotton pad and gently wipe face, eyes, and lips. Repeat until cotton pad looks clean and no need to rinse. Use as a cleanser, makeup, remover, or a toner for oily skin. Recommended for oily or shiny skin. Suitable for sensitive skin and eyes. Dermatologist & Ophthalmologist Tested Our Micellar Water is dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested to be suitable for sensitive skin and sensitive eyes. Deep-rooted in dermatological heritage, La Roche-Posay skin care products are developed according to a strict formulation charter to combine safety and efficacy. Why You Should Cleanse with La Roche-Posay Micellar Water The first key step in any skincare routine is a cleansing, but ordinary cleansers might not remove everything. Our Micellar Waters are proven to remove seen impurities as well as unseen impurities from your skin.",

I do use it multiple times until I see little or no makeup because I have acne prone skin as well, and need to get everything completely off or I\u2019ll breakout. So, this may be more pricey for some that being said. I do love it though yes more than garnier, but that\u2019s still an awesome brand. I just tend to breakout with that one.",
