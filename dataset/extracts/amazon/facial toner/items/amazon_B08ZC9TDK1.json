I have normal/combination skin, large pores on cheeks, and light acne. I\u2019ve been going through many different toners, some worked okay but I felt weren\u2019t making that much of a difference to buy again. This toner popped up on my recommended products and I did my research on it and wanted to try it. It\u2019s got wonderful clean ingredients and I loved the idea of it being a toner/serum, and the product size vs. cost is *chefs kiss*. You also don\u2019t need a lot, one good shake, about a dime size amount, spreads nicely over my face. I\u2019ve been using it for a couple weeks now and OMG. Literally saw the results immediately. My pores look so much smoother and refined, my skin is GLOWING in the morning! I\u2019ve also been using this with the cosrx snail mucin essence which I feel has been a game changing combination for my skin. It also feels calming and cool on the face. FINALLY have found the toner I\u2019ll be buying again. The price point, size, ingredients, results, it\u2019s all a 5 star from me, I couldn\u2019t recommend this enough.",

I heard this was a dupe for the Fenty Fat Water, so I wanted to give it a fair shot.I immediately purchased a second bottle upon emptying the first one.This is a beautiful toner and serum in one. I use this directly after showering/washing my face, and have noticed a significant difference in the quality of my skin. It's moisturizing and balancing, and leaves my skin plump and smooth. It has lightened dark spots and calmed occasional blemishes. It is a perfect canvas for moisturizer and makeup. I got a solid 6 weeks of daily use out of one bottle. This has quickly become a staple in my collection, and for $12 bucks, it's worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "I have recently revamped my skin care regimen. Morning time I was using a $160 serum and my skin was red, congested and very broken out. 3 days using this and my redness has calmed down, acne is gone and my skin is GLOWING. I can\u2019t believe it. I love everything about this product, especially the price point. It\u2019s everything I care about (quality and standards) at a great price point. Highly recommend for sensitive acne prone skin!",

                "reviewText": "Whenever I get out of the shower, my face feels like a tight mask. It's the worst. Putting this stuff on while my face is still a little moist totally prevents that from happening! It's great stuff and has lasted me a really long time. I have super dry skin and combining this stuff with some deep moisturizer has made a big difference.",

                "reviewText": "I have sensitive skin with atopic eczema and using this has really reduced the amount of breakouts I get on my face. The scent is mild but not overbearing, and the texture is like a more gelatinous serum with beads. It does moisturize, and sometimes I leave out my regular moisturizer.Overall, I used it over the course of 30 days to test and really saw my acne (which was minimal, so I'm not sure how it works for severe acne) and eczema reduce. I've maybe had one patch of eczema and two acne spots in the last three months. My skin tone has become more balanced and the toner really seeps into my skin, making it feel very soft and bouncy.10/10 would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is awesome. I am in my early thirties and have combination skin. Sometimes it's dry, sometimes oily, sometimes I break out, sometimes I don't. Finding something consistent for my skin had been difficult. This toner is the best I've used and along with the prebiotic moisturizer these work wonderfully together. My skin feels soft and moisturized. My pores aren't as noticeable. My random cystic spots are clearing and I haven't had any new blemishes since using this product. I highly recommend this. I wish I had these products as a teenager, but am still pleased I discovered them at 33. Hero is 100% worth a try.",
