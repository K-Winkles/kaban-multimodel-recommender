It made my face feel soft and clean after washing with my regular cleanser. I'm at the age where I, unfortunately, have to be worried about anti-aging serums, <sad face> but compared to others I've tried, this one ranks right up there with the top choices I've tried. There is really no scent, which is great for me because I'm sensitive to that. I also consider myself to have sensitive skin and I had no reactions after using this. My face was not itchy at all and usually I find toner to be kind of drying, which was not the case with this one. I was impressed at the size of the bottle too. This will last me a really long time because you don't need much and bottle is really large. I am using it cautiously, as the bottle mentions, to build up my skin's tolerance to it. So far it's just a few times a week until I get used to using it and make sure I don't have a reaction to it. So far, so good. I will most likely keep using this in my skincare routine.",

I don\u2019t know why this company was dishonest about this product being the Ordinary and once that happens they\u2019ve lost their credibility. Even though the product feels good and has no scent just like the Ordinary and seems almost identical, I really don\u2019t know why they weren\u2019t honest about this being a dupe of a popular product. I think if they included an ingredient list and was forthcoming and priced right, people will be willing to purchase but this isn\u2019t right.Update: I had received kojic acid powder that I wanted to test so I added it to this bottle of what I believe is glycolic acid and it mixed in very well and the product worked really well.

I was rather surprised to receive this however. Regardless, I tried looking for where the product was manufactured but couldn't find this info on the package or the product listing page. I also looked up the ingredients list but it isn't listed on the product or the listing page (general category of what's in the product is listed but not the complete ingredients list). So it's fair to assume, I will not be trying this on my face for safety reasons. I ended up giving this two-stars because it may very well be a decent product but it would be nice to see the ingredients list and country of manufacturing.",

Because it literally SAYS SO in the product description, and it looks exactly like it, and is priced exactly the same. I'm a fan of The Ordinary and would not have ordered this had I been more careful and realized it's not legit. If it was a quality dupe at a better price, sure, I'm always happy to save money. But this offers no additional benefit to make it worthwhile. I checked the ingredients list and they are nearly identical (but listed in different order, so not sure if it's a different formulation.) Overall, I'm annoyed that I was fooled into ordering something that is not what it seems. I've used it and, so far, it's just fine, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. If they didn't try to pass it off as a name brand, I would probably have given it 5 stars, but I think this is shady and I'll be careful to order the real thing next time.",

Aside from the fact that the words are misspelled, e.,g., Clinical is spelled \"linical\", there is no formal listing of ingredients as one would expect but just a product composition sidebar with a few pictures. No where on the box, product, or page listing does it indicate the place of manufacture or lot/batch numbers. There is no brand associated and looks like it was a school made prototype. The price of this is even higher than the real one!! Because there are too many unknowns and safety concerns, I chose not to use this product.",

This doesn't bother me, because who doesn't love a quality skin care dupe, but the original product is already very reasonably priced. I found this toner to be silky, effective, and non-irritating, so to me it is a very good product. The only thing that I found deficient is that I could not find a comprehensive ingredient list on either the bottle or the packaging. The \"product composition\" lists key ingredients, but I would like to see the full set of ingredients.",
