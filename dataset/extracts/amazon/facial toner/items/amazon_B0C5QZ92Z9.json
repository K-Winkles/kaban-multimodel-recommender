                "reviewText": "I recently had a unique experience with glycolic acid when I ordered what I believed to be The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, only to receive a different product in a similar-looking bottle. The product I received turned out to be from a different brand, and I was initially unsure about its effectiveness.However, I decided to give it a try, and here's what I found:Glycolic acid is a fantastic skincare ingredient known for its exfoliating properties. It's commonly used to address a range of skin concerns, from improving skin texture and tone to fading hyperpigmentation and even combating the signs of aging.The product I received, though not what I initially intended to purchase, did contain glycolic acid, and I decided to use it as part of my skincare routine. While I can't speak to the specific brand or product I received, I can certainly vouch for the potential benefits of glycolic acid itself.Glycolic acid has the power to exfoliate the skin, leaving it feeling smoother and more radiant. It can help with uneven skin tone and fade dark spots. Additionally, it's known for stimulating collagen production, which can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.However, glycolic acid isn't suitable for everyone. It can be potent, and individuals with sensitive skin may experience redness or irritation. It's crucial to perform a patch test and introduce glycolic acid slowly into your routine to ensure your skin can tolerate it.In conclusion, while my experience was unexpected due to the mix-up in product packaging, I can affirm the potential benefits of glycolic acid as an ingredient. If you've received a glycolic acid product that resembles a different brand, I recommend giving it a try, but always be cautious with new skincare products, especially if you have sensitive skin. And if you're still on the hunt for The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, make sure to double-check the product label to ensure you get the one you desire for your skincare needs.",

                "reviewText": "the little hole for the product to come out of isnt poked all the way through unlike literally every other squirt bottle in the entire world. the stopper isnt glued in either, i gave it a gentle squeeze and the top part with the faulty not-hole-hole POPPED OUT and my entire palm filled with the product minus some spillage and splashing before i could get the bottle upright. its a thicker formula, not thin liquid like you wouod expect so i am unhappy with how that means there is ultimately less product for use per application due to the physical properties of the acid. its like an oil but still slightly thicker, this at least helped the product stay pooled in my palm instead of running through my fingers; with a true liquid you would need to squeeze them together and stay very still and for this situation the thickness was more forgiving but it simple shouldnt have occurred in the first place. if it isnt clear by now, this isnt The Ordinary. this is some off brand attempted dupe. smells fine, i enjoy the feel and consistency, not super drying either but i wont purchase again considering the pros are simply the bare minimum expectations when spending your money on a product lol. with packaging this bad, the consistency of this product is probably sus, probably some sore of inconsistent poured-in-hime-kitchen type formula. godspeed yall!",
