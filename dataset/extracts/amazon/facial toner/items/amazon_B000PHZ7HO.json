                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great, great toner.",
                "reviewText": "I have an oily t-zone, combination skin, and was searching for a toner that would help my scars, blackheads, as well as getting my skin extra clean. I don't break out too much on my forehead, mostly my chin, and more recently it's been my nose.I stumbled along Mario Badescu, and could not be happier with this toner. I've gone through one full bottle of the 8oz, and I purchased it in November of 2011, and now it's the middle of December, 2012. I'd say that's good longevity for everyday, morning and night use.However, one -important- hint: Do not use a cotton ball to put the product on and then wipe your face, nix the cotton ball altogether and put a small dot of the liquid on your fingers- it's tricky to get it the first time to only come out a bead at a time, but just lean the 'squirter' on to your fingers and tip just a little ways. (It's water consistency, and will not be blue on your face.) Then take your *clean* hands and wipe your face with it. I guarantee you, this works, and I wished I had done it this way since I got the product; I used up almost half the bottle in probably only two months using the cotton ball method in the beginning.I use the Glycolic Acid Toner by washing my face night/day (I use a sulfur soap) and then pat dry. With my clean hands, I gently wipe the toner pretty much everywhere, adding more to my fingers and wiping down any areas I feel need it. Let dry.My face turns red using this, but that's just simple blood circulation and the 'harshness' of pushing/rubbing on my skin.(I'm beginning to diagnose myself as sensitive.) I also used to only use it in the night, but after I felt like my skin kinda needed it in the morning.I've noticed my skin \"craving\" this more in the winter- I feel like it's a good way to exfoliate the dead winter dryness. However, it SAVED my skin when I went from the Utah climate to Houston in the summer- I was breaking out, and couldn't leave little zits everywhere, so after I popped them, I used this- it dries it up, and burns anything that's open a little, but it helps with scars and probably disinfects some. I wouldn't say that it helps greatly with blackheads, but I'm guessing if you have 'first stage' blackheads it'll probably help: mine are about at the stage 'embedded in my skin for eternity.' :D I do think it helps with scars, it just takes time. It speeds the regular process up, I'd say, though.The first time you use this, you'll probably notice tingling, but after regular use this goes away. This gives my skin a great glow, and it does not break me out, (oily, combo, redness, zits on chin and nose, blackheads on nose.) Does not dry out my skin, even in the winter. I'm 16, for more info.I purchased just recently the 16 oz size, and I've noticed in a year: The ingredients are the same, but it seems like this 'fresher batch' made more immediate improvement- maybe it would be a better idea to by the smaller size? Like the ingredients become expired? (No expiration date that I've found.) And also, the only thing on the label that's changed is it says not to use on breakout-erupted skin. I wouldn't say my acne is severe, more slightly moderate. I have no problem with this toner. I love it!Bottom line: Buy if you want fresh, clean skin, to reduce acne scarring, help early blackheads, with a nice clean glow and mild exfoliation.",

I used to use a glycolic wipe for men , yet at 25$ for 30 wipes it just was too $$I still have 1/3 of the bottle left and it clears my acne prone skin, even at 60 years of age :/And also helps reduce fine lines , and greasy face from too much sugar etc -Definitely wld recommend it !!!",

                "reviewText": "I have extremely sensitive skin and have had an allergic reaction to something off and on for the last year. We've narrowed down to what the possible allergic reactions could be but my skin can become very irritated very easily. It got to the point that I only washed my face with plain water daily or with Noxzema once or twice a week. So, I need to be very careful what I use on my face.The problem with some skin care products is that they remove the oils from your skin and then your skin is too dry. The skin then tries to compensate and becomes too oily. For me, this product does not do that.I bought this toner, even though I thought it a bit pricey at the start, because of the glycolic acid in it. This is supposed to help remove dead skin cells and stimulate collagen growth. I did look that up on Google before buying. I was expecting it to redden my skin like some men\u2019s skin care products but it doesn't on my skin. Now, after using it for a few weeks, it\u2019s worth every penny.I use it of a morning and of an evening before going to bed. I may rinse my face with water first, apply this, let sit and then apply it a second time. I also took a chance on buying Kiehl's moisturizer which I then usually apply a very small amount after I shower or sometimes not.Because of the allergy issue and a precancerous keratoma spot or two I had, I see a dermatologist every six months. Basically my doctor visits are now a follow up for these conditions. The doctor looked at my face this last time and said my skin looked very good. That\u2019s a pretty good recommendation coming from a dermatologist.The bottle has a flip up little spout meaning you can more accurately dispense the amount you want. And, if you should happen to drop it, the amount spilled will be a lot less because of this type of cap.I started using the Kiehl's first and then this a few weeks later. My skin looks very good compared to how it did only a few months ago since beginning this regimen.",

                "reviewText": "I have launched a comprehensive, full-throttle attack recently on my skin. It's always been pretty good, but age, health and stress have dulled it and lines are peeking through. Hence the glycolic acid toner.I use it twice daily with a cotton pad, making sure to use it as an application not a cleaning solution. Because I am at war I have been applying it under my eyes and it does sting for a few minutes (then dissapates). That is my fault, not theirs.My skin is smoother and definitely more hydrated. I have been using a variety of new products, so I cannot say for sure that it's helped in toning my skin, but it hasn't done anything negative either. It used to pull and tighten horribly and now looks healthy and tone is improving.Will repurchase!",
