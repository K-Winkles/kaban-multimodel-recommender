Over the years, I\u2019ve tried a couple of different brands, but always come back to Garnier.",

                "reviewText": "I've struggled to find the perfect makeup remover for a while, but I've finally found one that exceeded my expectations. This makeup remover is an absolute game-changer. One of the standout features of this remover is its ability to remove eye makeup thoroughly. It effortlessly wipes away mascara, eyeshadow, and even stubborn waterproof eyeliner without any tugging or scrubbing. I've tried countless other removers, but none have been as effective at gently and quickly removing eye makeup like this one.Another benefit of this remover is how thoroughly it cleanses the skin. Even after a long day of wearing heavy makeup, this remover effortlessly lifts away every trace of foundation, concealer, and bronzer. As a result, my skin feels clean, fresh, soft, and rejuvenated.What sets this makeup remover apart from others is the impact it has had on my skin. Since I started using this remover, my complexion has noticeably improved. I've seen a reduction in breakouts and my skin looks healthier overall. As a busy mom of three, it's also a huge time saver! I can remove my makeup and cleanse my skin in one step.",

                "reviewText": "Micellar water has the consistency of water, and the opening is just a little bit too big, so you might squirt out more than needed until you get the hang of it. It works though, removing makeup with a few swipes. It's gentle on the skin and tingled only a bit without much irritation. The scent isn't bad, and I'd rate the moisturizing ability medium. It's only very, very slightly sticky after being air-dried.",

This, however, has proven to be just as effective in removing dirt, excess oil, and makeup without drying or irritating my skin. I\u2019d like to think I have sensitive skin, especially around my nose and eyes but have no issue using this cleanser. I love that it doesn\u2019t leave any residue after each use; and when I\u2019ve gotten it in my eyes it\u2019s not at all irritating, nor did it sting. I give this an A++ and highly recommend it.",
