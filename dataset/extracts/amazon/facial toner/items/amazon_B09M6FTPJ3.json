                "reviewText": "I got the NOLAHOUR Vegan Watery Toner and the NOLAHOUR Vegan Watery Moisturizer and I really enjoy the set. It seems like the advertised calming and soothing effect is really happening. My face skin feels always well moisturized and calm. There is no scent by this toner - it feels almost like water. It supposed to be very gentle and for the most part it is. I did noticed some burning feeling on some face spots like a fresh pimple - my teenage daughter confirmed that too. Nothing bad but you have to be careful if you have sensitive skin or other skin issues. I am not sure which ingredient caused it since there is no alcohol in it, maybe the hyaluronic acid.The only thing I am really missing is the English translation of the ingredients on the bottle. If this Korean brand wants to be successful on the international market, that has to be changed. Yes, you can read it on the website but I like to look at the bottle I am using and read it again and again... and I can imagine a lot of users/customers feel the same way.",

                "reviewText": "I am your typical guy that had never taken care of facial skin during most of my life. Since I am approaching retirement age, my face has taken a beating. I have age spots and many freckles which makes me use many sunblock lotion on a daily basis. In the past, I would come home and wash the face and then reapply the sunblock the next day. Repeat many times. As a result, my skin goes through stages of drying up or even becoming oily. A friend recommended me to try hydrating toners to balance and rejuvenate my skin. I found this Nolahour Vegan Watery Toner and jumped on it.So first step is to wash your face well. Then put a decent amount into your palm and pat over your face. Simple! The toner has a slight thickness to it. You do feel a little stickiness as the fluid is absorbed into the skin. Once dried, the skin has no stickiness and you sense a tightening of the skin as well. I do feel it has locked in some moisture under the skin. This is going to entering into my daily facial routine. I also like that there is no hint of a scent.I have sensitive skin an I have not experienced any issues using this toner. Recommended! 5 Stars.",

                "reviewText": "I used this after washing my face, before putting on my serum and moisturizer. The instructions say to pat into your face, but I like to saturate a cotton ball and swipe over my face. It found some dirt/makeup/oil that my cleanser must have missed as the cotton ball was discolored after I swiped it on my face. My skin felt soft and soothed, and I followed with serum and moisturizer. My skin is feeling comfortable and soft, so this and the other products used must have helped. Overall, this product seems good for dry skin like mine, it did not sting or cause redness, irritations or breakouts. It was unscented as far as I can tell. It seems high quality. I would recommend.",

I used after I wash my face, I applied it using a cotton ball. I loved the fact it comes sealed as every self care product or makeup should be. I got myself the Moisturizer from this collection and so far this line has been kind to my skin.",
