However, every product I used did not work well; they felt just like water. When they absorbed into my skin, I experienced some dryness. But this product is different. When I apply it to my skin, it makes my skin smoother and hydrates it without leaving a sticky texture. So, I applied it three times after it was absorbed by my skin. It works really well, and I highly recommend it to people who experience dryness and have skin troubles related to hydration.",

It took me a minute to realize why they named it as it is, \u201cph balanced\u201d, like a pool has to be ph balanced. Anyway, this is a great, everyday use toner! It\u2019s gentle, would be good for people with sensitive skin. It\u2019s unscented. It\u2019s a toner, so it\u2019s runny, not like a lotion. I use my fingers to apply it, and it absorbs in the skin quickly. My skin looks and feels great! My face looks healthy and revitalized! I usually have large pores on my nose, this toner shrinks them so you can\u2019t even see them. My skin is clear and smooth, and the best thing, I\u2019m not putting harmful chemicals on it! It hydrates nicely. I highly recommend this toner! I will continue using it due to the clean ingredients and fantastic outcome. This is the only thing that has cleaned out my pores besides acid.",

Nowhere on the instructions does it say anything about using after you hop out of the pool.So far, my skin loves this! There is no fragrance. The consistency is runny, but it\u2019s thicker than water. Absorbs quickly and doesn\u2019t dry out my skin. This toner seems to keep my skin more balanced, for when I use it before bed, my facial oils have been keeping under control when I wake up in the morning.Oh, and the first thing I noticed about the packaging was that it includes writing in braille. Really neat and unusual.",

                "reviewText": "You dont need to use this just after swimming or in the hot tub you can use it anytime and daily. I was able to start using at the same time we ended up going to a indoor water park for two days and either the chlorine didnt dry my face out as I figured it would or this did a pretty good job. The rest of skin needed my oil in the bath and then a thick body butter after for me not to feel my arms and legs were dry feeling. I didnt need anything extra for my face, i kept my routine normal except using this. Now back at home and using daily without going into a pool or chlorinated chemical water it\u2019s still been working really well. In the summer with all the combination of elements I would like to try this during that time to see if its still just as effective with daily pool use",

                "reviewText": "So far this has been gentle on my extremely sensitive skin. I haven't noticed any dramatic effects in a moisturizing or exfoliating way. However, it hasn't made my skin worse so I enjoy that.This is good as a semi moisturizing, gentle toner, but I prefer toners with more actives. It is currently $21.99 for one bottle. It's not something I would repurchase at this time.",
