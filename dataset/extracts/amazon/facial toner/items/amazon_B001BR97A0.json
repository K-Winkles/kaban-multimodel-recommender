                "reviewText": "I have started a cult following of this brand and scent of witch hazel. !! Not even kidding.I started using it years ago. I use a mild soap to wash my face then I moisen a cotton pad with Thayer's witch hazel (always the rose!!) and cleanse/tone my skin. It tingles a little bit but feels so nice and hydrating!I use it on my skin every single day. I use it on a sunburn. I used it after I shave.I got my mom addicted, she started noticing how it made my skin look and feel, so maturing you wanted to know what I was doing!!It started tightening up her face and giving it more of a glow! She was hooked!I got two of my friends addicted!My sister's and sister-in-laws love it and have noticed a youthful glow to their skin.I even got my man addicted to it! After years of harsh sun and little to no moisturizing ... It has brought back his skin to a nice healthy looking glow. He swears by it and tells people about it too!It hydrates and makes you feel clean!!! You should start to notice a glow for awhile of consist use. Consist use over time is key!These things take time.... But I can say, after 10 years of use... And creating a following, shall we say.. cult of Thayer's Witch Hazel lovers!!! I would recommend this to anyone!I have watched people who are acne prone, people with skin issues of all kinds slowly clear up, over time, and start looking healthier. It cant fix everything... But it certainly improves and helps!Can you tell that I am addicted??Try it for yourself. Use it everyday for at least a month or two.Don't limit it to your face either!!I use it on camping trips to cleanse my face when water is limited, I also use it on my arms and legs.Ladies, use it on your collarbone to keep your skin from prematurely aging. Moisture after.I use it to sooth bug bites, itchy skin... Dry skin... You name it, I've probably tried it.I recommend the rose witch hazel. Best smell... Best feel... Best.Just buy it already!! Or I'll have to keep writing long reviews about it!",

                "reviewText": "I am a long time user of Thayer\u2019s toner and realized I\u2019d never reviewed it because I initially purchased it from drug stores. Since I ordered this one on Amazon, I decided to share the benefits I experience using this toner.The big thing is that it doesn\u2019t dry my facial skin like so many other toners, which is not just because it is alcohol free. It is said that the first 5 ingredients of a product is the bulk of that product. When you read the first 5 ingredients of this Witch Hazel, it is understandable why it provides such a satisfying result.It is the best prep ever for my moisturizers and serums, helping to absorb them deeply into the skin.One glance at your cotton ball after applying and you see the resistant oily residue it removes even after washing your face, yet leaving your face refreshed instead of that dried out feeling. With its subtle pleasant scent, and care of my very sensitive skin, I love Thayers and highly recommend it.",

I like the subtle cucumber scent, it blends well with my Olay body wash. I cannot say this product does much for my dry patches but with my skin condition I doubt anything will. What I like is even after a thorough cleansing, applying this product will pick up any residue you did not know you have. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and alive. I like to let it work its way through my eyebrows, then apply to my eyelids to refresh my tired eyes. The perfect way to wake up your face in the morning and refresh yourself during the day.",
