                "reviewText": "I have acne prone combination skin- I honestly love this product, because it's very hydrating and doesn't break me out. I feel like I don't even need moisturizer. I do use the layering method where you slop on 3-5 layers letting them dry in between, so I don't really know how well it works with just one. But 100% would recommend, smells like nothing and yet very pleasant.",
