                "reviewText": "Unfortunately this just didn't react well to my skin. I have combination skin with the T zone being the oily area. It helped control the oil production a bit, but I kept breaking out around my chin and upper lip when I used this. I figured it was just because I switched toners, so I gave it the 30 days. It didn't improve my skin at all - if anything, it gave me more whiteheads than normal. My face also looked so lack-luster. I switched back to my old toner and immediately noticed an improvement in the acne and skin tone. It just didn't work for me, but it looks like it works well for others.",
