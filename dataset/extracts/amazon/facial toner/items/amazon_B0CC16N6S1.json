Gentle enough to be used twice daily but I only use it in the morning and the retinol version at night. There is a mild scent but nothing too rancid for my liking and each pad is always soaked, so you don\u2019t have to worry about how much liquid product you\u2019re getting because you\u2019re getting a lot for the value you\u2019re paying. I am on my refill of these toning pads and I must say that my face looks so dewy and glowy. I also notice less acne and breakouts but I do not notice that it does anything for my dark spots \u2014However, I will continue to use this for now.",

                "reviewText": "This is a toner pad that's gone viral recently - I didn't realize when I bought this that it is only a replacement. Meaning that once you open this it cannot be resealed. I just put the entire box in a zip lock bag to avoid having to buy the container in order to resolve the issue. The pads feel slightly rough and I worry a little that it might be mildly abrasive but maybe that's a good thing. I've heard that it can also be used as a kind of face mask (just put multiple pads all over your face and let it soak up the toner). I tried this once but not sure what it did for my skin honestly. I also am not sure I've seen any marked improvement since I've started using these either. But it can't hurt, I suppose.",
