For many yrs I hate when I go to an event or even outside & immediately after my shower with good face wash I switch from Kylie Jenner foam face wash, but recently bought the debascus rose oil cleanser which I love. I decided to by this beauty rose spray and wohhhh what a difference it's made in the past few days. My face has evened out so no more bumps, uneven skin tone and my face isn't oily at all, it looks so amazing & healthy. My fiance asked me what I've been using on my face & I showed him the amazing product I purchased. (I wish I was a selfy kinda girl cuz I tell ya I'd show ya all a before & after pic...but u never been that kinda girl lol) \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I spritz it on my face then add some to a cotton ball after my face is washed and it looks like I just spent a million $ for a facial. It's soooo smooth feeling that I could touch my face all day, but we all know how many germs are on our hands, so I have to tell myself to \ud83d\uded1 stop!!! The package arrived quickly and securely. I will definitely order more once this bottle gets about 3/4 gone. Don't hesitate...give it a try u won't be disappointed.",

This product is not only exceptionally good, but it also provides a refreshing experience that I highly recommend to others.First and foremost, the fragrance of the rosewater is absolutely divine. The gentle floral scent instantly transports you to a serene garden, creating a calming and relaxing ambiance. It's like a breath of fresh air for your senses, leaving you feeling rejuvenated and invigorated.The mist itself is incredibly fine and lightweight, ensuring an even and delicate application. With just a few spritzes, it effortlessly covers your face, creating a soothing and moisturizing layer. I particularly appreciate how it absorbs quickly into the skin, without leaving any greasy or sticky residue behind. It's perfect for any time of day, whether you need a quick pick-me-up or a soothing mist before bed.",

I've been using this product for over 2 weeks now, and it has left my skin feeling clean & refreshed.I have pretty sensitive skin, and most toners I've used in the past have always felt very dry and itchy on my skin because of the harsh chemical ingredients, so I always avoided using them. But not with this toner because it's made with clean ingredients which are paraben & chemical free, non-toxic, not tested on animals and vegan. Not to mention, the toner smells just like a fresh bouquet of roses.I'm really happy that I finally found a toner that is perfect for my skin type.",
