                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic, inexpensive natural toner, and it smells great. I normally don't use toners so I don't have anything else to compare it to. The closest thing to a toner that I have used is a softener from a high end brand, which I am not going to name (am I allowed to mention other brands in my Amazon reviews?). When I first used the softener, which is $50, I thought, \"WOW this is amazing!\" because it literally softens the skin. But since it is, after all, $50, I wanted to find a cheaper (and definitely more natural) alternative. I stumbled on this facial toner while looking for aloe vera products on Amazon and decided to give it a go.So how did this approximately $20 toner compare to the $50 softener? Pretty well I would say.The way softener works is that it prepares your skin for moisturizing, and it allows the skin to absorb more products. It also helps remove dirt, makeup, and soap residue. It's quite similar to a toner. So here's a comparison breakdown between Beauty by Earth toner and the high-end softener:1) Is it moisturizing?True to its name, the softener really softens and takes away that dry feeling I normally get after cleansing. The toner does moisturize to a certain extent. But make no mistake, the moisturizing power does not match that of the softener (keep in mind that this softener has quite a lot of chemicals in it to make that happen).2) Is it refreshing?Both refresh the skin quite well. However, I prefer the toner because it smells so good! I put the toner in the fridge too, and that's added bonus for the hot weather (I live in California).3) Does it clean well?Both clean well. I normally don't wash my face with soap in the morning, so the toner is perfect for me as a morning cleanser and refresher. So far, I am loving this quick, simple experience.4) Price?Obviously, the toner wins here.5) Ingredients?Again, the toner wins with its natural and organic ingredients.6) Overall experience?Although I liked the softener, it didn't really improve my skin. I ran out of the softener so I stopped using it, and my skin certainly doesn't miss it. As for Beauty by Earth's toner, I wouldn't say that it changed my life. However, I do notice the overall improvement in my skin tone after using it. My skin looks brighter, like it's glowing from the inside out. Side note: I did start adding other aloe vera products to my skin care routine and that probably helped too.In conclusion, if you're looking for something to freshen up your skin or for a quick cleanser or quick moisturizer (probably will work better for someone with oily skin than dry skin), give this toner a try!",

                "reviewText": "After a year of using witch hazel astringent pads and putting up with that awful smell, thinking it was good just to be using something all natural and alcohol-free and all that, I realized there has to be something better.First off, I knew I wanted to ditch the pre-moistened pads. Like most other things, you pay for this added \"convenience\", and applying a bit of product to a cotton pad isn't nearly hassle enough to justify paying for it. On top of that, most astringent pads are very thin and abrasive, which is a real problem if you have a beard or even just stubble.So I thought maybe I'd try a bottle of witch hazel extract, but I really dislike the smell, so somehow along the way I stumbled upon this. I read about the benefits of rose water and witch hazel, how some people prefer one or the other for various reasons - but this one combines them both, and it has all the natural benefits to go along with it. Sure, it's a bit pricier than some alternatives, but skimping on skin care is usually only a temporary habit - you buy something on the cheaper end of things, use it for a while, realize you're dissatisfied, then pay a few bucks more and find the difference is noticeable and more than worth it.So I ordered a bottle of this stuff along with Delon 100% Cleansing Cotton Rounds, which seemed to be the best value and I still believe it is. In the morning I'll shower, use Anthony Logistics Glycolic Facial Cleanser, shave using a safety razor and Truefitt & Hill cream, then follow up with an alum block, Beauty by Earth Facial Toner, and Anthony Logistics Oil Free Facial Lotion. Summer, Winter, whenever - this routine works for me. I also use this Facial Toner when I get home from work, just as a relaxing refresher because it's quick, easy, and feels nice.The aroma is definitely on the rose-y end of the spectrum, which I thought might be a put-off, but it's not a scent that lingers, so you don't have to worry about using this and walking around smelling like a bed of flowers. Whether you love it or hate it, either way, it's a big step up from that pure witch hazel funk.",

Sin embargo este t\u00f3nico ha dejado mi piel agradablemente hidratada y el\u00e1stica (y perfumada) despu\u00e9s de lavarme la cara, que sin \u00e9l me quedar\u00eda seca y tirante hasta echarme la crema (he usado un jab\u00f3n de Lancaster). Se siente como si hubieses aplicado un liger\u00edsimo aceite o crema (ojo, que no es aceitoso, me refiero al efecto sobre la piel)Refresca estupendamente al volver de la calle sudorosa, y al pasar el algod\u00f3n se ve lo mucho que es capaz de limpiar, tanto como un agua micelar (no la he usado llevando maquillaje).El frasco, de pl\u00e1stico,no lleva atomizador, hay que trasladarlo a otro si lo quieres usar de esta forma, lo bueno es que uno peque\u00f1o cabe en el bolso y as\u00ed se aprovecha mejor en verano.Puede usarse en el area de los ojos, para m\u00ed fundamental. El olor es estupendo, destacando el aroma a rosas con algo m\u00e1s.En resumen, piel c\u00f3moda, suave, sin agresiones producidas por el alcohol que lleva la mayor\u00eda, poros cerraditos. Lo recomiendo.",

                "reviewText": "Looooove it! Smells so nice. Gentle. Great as toner and for insect bites.I have purchased several Beauty by Earth products on Amazon.ca, and I love them all.This toner is very gentle on the skin and has so many uses. I also open it sometimes just to smell it. It really is like \"smelling the roses.\"I use it as a toner in my daily skin care routine. Works better than any other toner I have used in the past. Plus it is all natural. I am usually quite sceptical about products claiming to be organic. I usually do not expect it to work as intended or think it will contain \"natural\" ingredients that have no place being in skin products. Just because it says 100% natural does not mean it is safe for the skin. This toner, however, is. I have combination skin, and this does not make my face oily at all. It is hydrating but not greasy.I have used it on insect bites so itchy they kept me up at night. I just poured it onto a cotton ball and pressed it on the skin for a while. Did the trick! Soothes the itch.My only \"regret\" is not getting this toner in the available spray format. I actually wonder why the toner is offered in two formats. It would be nice to just spritz it on my face on hot days or to relieve itchy skin or sunburns. I do not want to risk putting the toner in a cheap spray bottle and alter it's effect.I also have the clay face mask, aloe Vera gel and Beautyful makeup bag. I can't wait to try the newly added Beauty by Earth face wash and face scrub.",

                "reviewText": "I initially bought the smaller spray bottle of this product which was a little cheaper, just incase I didn't like the product, or it didn't work for my somewhat now older skin, which can be a bit of everything including battling enlarged pores. Well I just bought my 2nd order of the larger non- spray bottle as a refill for my spray bottle, because this spray is wonderful. It has helped my pores become smaller, it boosts my other facial products, as I generally spray it on before and after anything I use for aging skin. This toner also boosts my fresh face look when I'm not wearing makeup, and has helped my morning glow. It has helped clear up any blemishes or new scaring which would take months to clear up, but now it's just weeks. I cause my skin to feel alive and ready for the day. Corny but true! \ud83d\ude00",

                "reviewText": "UpdateSo I have purchased 3 bottles so far.This product has multiple uses. I have used it for my pimples, and cystic acne. I have also used it on sunburns, bruises. I even use it to clean my dogs ears ( I put a small amount on a cotton pad and clean inside the ear). I even had a cyst that I was trying to get rid of and after using it 3 times in one day the cyst popped. I rave to everyone about this product and I recommend it to anyone that has acne, pimples etc. As far as face acne it will take a few weeks to clear up but once it does your face feels amazing. Make sure you have a good moisturizer.This product is truly amazing. I have battled cystic acne, eczema and rosacea and nothing has worked. I've been using this toner for over a month and it has reduced my acne, and any dryness. I only use it in the morning after washing my face. My skin tone has evened out and I don't need to wear foundation. Good product I will be ordering again.",
