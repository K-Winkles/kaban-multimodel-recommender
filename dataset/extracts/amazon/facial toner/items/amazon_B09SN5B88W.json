I cleanse everyday, twice a day but I still saw blackheads and clogged, large pores. So I realized I was going to have to add a toner. After more research I decided to try this. It seemed to check all the boxes for my 48 year old sensitive skin. I used it last night for the first time after cleansing. I looked at the cotton afterwards and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was looking at. Soooo much dirt! I only wear a skin tint, not full foundation and the cotton was filthy. All of that junk has just been sitting in my pores and I was stunned. And my skin wasn\u2019t sensitive to it at all. I e seen the error of my ways and will continue toning.",
