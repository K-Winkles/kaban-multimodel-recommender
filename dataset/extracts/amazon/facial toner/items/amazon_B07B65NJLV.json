Klairs decided to change the *injection molding process to minimize wasted plastic during the production and at the same time to product containers of better quality. The first product created through this new production method is the Unscented Toner (LOT No. NN05, NN06). As you can see in the picture above, while modifying and developing the injection process, the color of the container came to have a yellowish hue. Other than the color of the container, the contents are identical to the original. With consideration, we came to a conclusion not to dispose of these containers since that would be against Klairs\u2019 mottos of sustainable.

                "reviewText": "I am not a \u201cinfluencer\u201c because I prefer to work after obtaining three master degrees in business. But what I do know is how to make your face stay as wrinkle-free, moisturized, with no redness or irritation. I do understand that many facial products are very expensive. And believe me, I have tried many different products including a few $500 moisturizers but it is not better than a lot that are approximately $15 . In fact, one of the $500 moisturizers burnt my face and I had to go to a dermatologist to get a topical steroid cream and use it three times a day on my face. I know you can watch tons of YouTube videos or these so-called \u201cinfluencers \u201cwho are getting paid for you to use their suggested products. My advice is free and I have spoken with many of my friends, 3 who are dermatologists, regarding my regime. If you follow the steps, everything I stated in the beginning will be true. First, no matter if you just got out of the shower and didn\u2019t exfoliate your face, you will still have leftover make up or not a perfectly clean pallet to start with. First purchase 100% cotton exfoliating pads that are double sided. One side will be a bit rougher and other side will be smooth. Very inexpensive to find. If you don\u2019t want to buy facial cloths that are already have the make-up remover that\u2019s fine because they are expensive and you can do it so much less and expensive my way. Take the soft side of the pad to clean your face. Molecular cleaning water is fabulous and inexpensive. Use the pad from your forehead to your chin in a circular motion. Next, don\u2019t forget about your neck. Always wipe up and not in a circular motion because gravity will pull your skin down especially around your neck and if you are on the thinner side. The thinner you are, the more wrinkles and loose skin will show as you get older. It\u2019s a catch-22 for us women. Let\u2019s have the perfect body yet in maintaining that, our faces will age more noticeably. Once you have used the soft side, turn the pad around and do the exact same thing with the exfoliating side. You will be surprised to see how much make-up is still on your face even after you shower. Next comes toner. I am a diamond member at a \u201cbeauty store \u201cbut Amazon sells these products at a much better price point. I strongly suggest using Klair\u2019s Supple Saturation Non-Scented Toner. It sells out quite often at the beauty store because it is a five star product with over 3000 reviews. On Amazon, I believe it\u2019s only $21 or so. This will be the most expensive product I am telling you to use. Take another round pad and use the soft side. The Claire\u2019s comes out differently from other brands, say Thayers Toner, as it slowly drips from the bottle. I drip four drops on my forehead, three on each side of my cheek, one of my nose, three on my lower face near my chin, two above my top lip and two on my neck. Gently, once again in a circular motion, spread the toner across your face and sweep up boards at the neck area. Your face is now ready for the remaining products. Next I use a retinol product the one I\u2019m suggesting is fabulous and is very inexpensive. 1HEROLABS Extreme Retinol Serum. it comes out in a tube and I put four drops on my forehead,three on each cheek, one on my nose, three on my chin, one on my upper lip and lastly, two on my neck. Rub it into your face gently with using your pointer finger. My next to last step is COURX Snail Musin. I usually use four drops on my forehead, three drops on each cheek, one on my nose, one on my upper lip, two on my chin and two on my neck. Once again, using your pointer finger, rub it in now this is the last thing that I do good old Vaseline. What it does is hold the moisturizers and products onto your face while you sleep I use a tiny bit on my forehead and around my mouth And chin area. This may sound like it would takes hours but it doesn\u2019t. 10 minutes at the most and you will have fabulous skin! Total cost under $50 and all products can be bought at Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I ran out of my Acwell licorice toner and wanted to try this product, as it's highly recommended. It's not really a substitute for the Acwell toner, as it feels more like a thick essence than a toner. You definitely put this on with your palms and not pads, and it doesn't make your skin feel fresh and prepped. It does make my skin the slightest bit irritated when I use it, but it's not terrible. I don't find myself reaching for it after cleansing like I always did with the Acwell, which means I wouldn't buy this again. I like the idea, though.",

                "reviewText": "This is arguably the greatest toner created, or at least within my testing pool of products I've tried. Incredibly gentle, moisturizing, non-irritating, no smell, no shoddy ingredients (fragrance, alcohol, parabens, whatever else). Just a toner that works. Sometimes I'll put multiple layers on to speed up pH balancing my skin. Either way, it is great for post-cleansing to balance the pH level on your skin, restore your moisture barrier and prepare for a moisturizer. This is one of the only skincare products that I think I could actually rate 11/10 and use the rest of my life if they never change the formula. The regular scented one is great too, but I prefer no fragrances.Yes, it really is that good.PS: If you are skeptical about purchasing skincare products from Amazon, buy on YesStyle for authenticity.",
