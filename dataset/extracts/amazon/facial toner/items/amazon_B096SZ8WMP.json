                "reviewText": "I use this every day after showering. My skin absorbs lotion better, feeling considerably softer, smaller pores and a huge improvement to blackheads. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has never caused any issues. When I was getting into the habit of using it, I noticed within minutes if I forgot to use it since my skin felt tight and dry. I took it on a trip and it slipped out of my bad and broke. I was able to save about a third of it in a travel bottle I had but I immediately bought a new one to replace it. I suggest taking it in a plastic travel bottle or storing carefully when traveling even though the glass is very thick.",
