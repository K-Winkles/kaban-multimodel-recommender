A friend mentioned trying a glycolic acid product on my armpits in the morning to help with the smell, so of course I bought some. Thayers is a good, trustworthy brand & just so happened to have a glycolic acid product. I have been applying some product on my underarms daily & it has been a godsend!!Please note: I have sensitive skin & this was a GREAT alternative for the chemical filled deodorants you can buy at the store! I have tried tons & TONS of deodorants in the past (womens, mens, spray, gel, etc.) & NONE have worked as well or as fast as this!!! This product doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything to help with sweat, but it takes away the odor completely.This product not only contains glycolic acid (which is great for your sensitive skin areas), but it also contains witch hazel & lactic acids which are some of the best acids to use for your underarms. 10/10 recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a last ditch effort to keep up with natural deodorant. For years I've tried every big brand with zero luck. Even right out of the shower, after scrubbing with soap, I still feel like my body odor is there. I read somewhere that glycolic acid toner could help, so I figured I'd give this a try. I had this overnighted, tried it this morning by applying right after the shower, used my natural deodorant, and no kidding 12 hours later I smell fresh!! I had a really active day running around outdoors and am ending my day feeling and smelling clean. It's incredible. If you're suffering from body odor try this.",
