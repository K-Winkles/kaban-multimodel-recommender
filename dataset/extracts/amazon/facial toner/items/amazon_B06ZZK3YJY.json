After I wash my face in the morning, I put a little bit in the palm of my hand, and then apply it on my face. In the evening, especially if I\u2019ve worn make up, I use a cotton pad to apply to my face to remove any remaining residue. Since the cotton pad absorbs some of the toner, you need to use a little more than you would in the morning. I\u2019m glad I bought it and I would buy it again.",

I\u2019ve never used a toner before but after my dermatologist recommend I use one, I found this one. It\u2019s so hydrating! I pair this with the PYUNKANG YUL Low pH Pore Deep Cleansing Foam and the pyunkang yul calming barrier moisture cream. They work perfectly together. This toner has no smell. It\u2019s not very slimy. It\u2019s more watery than slimy but don\u2019t let the thickness throw you off! This is such a simple product but it does what it needs to do! I would recommend.",

Using cotton balls with this product is kinda tricky and I find myself using a lot more. However when I put the product on my fingers it's okay. I still use it and very much enjoy it the feel afterwards. I have somewhat sensitive skin and it didn't break out my skin in any way. I'll most likely buy again.",
