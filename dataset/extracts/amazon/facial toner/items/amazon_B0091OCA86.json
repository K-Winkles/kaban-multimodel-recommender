                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful toner on sensitive and uneven skin!",
                "reviewText": "I've just come out of the postpartum cave where I allowed my skin to go to you know where! Baby is 15 months and I've just turned 38, medium olive-skinned (middle Eastern descent), big pores and some small blackheads on my nose and around my inner cheeks. Uneven skin tone, particularly in winter. No acne, but the occasional zit, especially if some product bothers my skin or if my hair is touching my cheeks. The unevenness, dullness and hyperpigmentation (from some old breakouts along my jawline) are my biggest concerns. In with the Andalou brightening line!I've been using this toner for just a few days (added it after loving the brightening serum and the glycolic pumpkin mask). I use it in conjunction with the AMAZING Acure brightening scrub (everyone should own this!) every other day and the Athena Beauty & Soul Pro Face Wash & Facial Cleanser every other day and at night. I don't think I had realized that the toner has glycolic acid until I checked the box (when it tingled upon application). Since I'm trying to even my skin tone, that's great and just the right amount to use in conjunction with the glycolic pumpkin mask (which I will be using 1-2 times a week). They've really gotten a great balance in the toner though because it isn't at ALL drying. On the contrary, just the toner alone is enough to add back the little bit of moisture lost washing my face. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and ready for the serum. I had never been a multi-step kind of person, mainly because my skin is really sensitive and so many products broke me out! I'm happy to report no adverse reaction to the face washe or scrub listed above, and no problems AT ALL layering this toner and the Andalou brightening serum!I do find it best to spritz a little toner on my (clean) fingers to get it around my nose and on any particular problem spot that I'd like to target. But the sprayer is really high quality and delivers a nice, even, diffuse spray (concentrated up-close), so this isn't a problem.The only other Vitamin C products I had ever tried, a few years back, were Avalon Organics and I found them sticky and weird-smelling. Plus, they broke me out, so that was that! So glad to have given Vitamin C another try and really really happy with the Andalou line. The ONLY product I haven't liked so far in this line is the BB cream. I'll need to find something else with SPF since the toner (and mask) contain glycolic. But that's just good skin practice anyway.So just a week or so in, my skin tone is definitely looking more even, skin is soft and smooth! Even if this doesn't fade the dark marks around my jawline, they'll go away on their own and the really important thing is that the products I'm using don't cause NEW ones while also evening out my skin tone in general. So far, so good!!Edited to add: So I'm a few weeks in using this and the above-listed products. I've gotten a couple of little zits here and there, but none of them have gotten big and angry. A few have just disappeared before ever getting a foothold and, even better, these products have seriously blocked the formation of the hyperpigmentation I've always suffered following even the tiniest blemish or scratch!!! Now the blemish heals and my skin looks normal in its wake! That was unexpected and makes these products just that much more amazing! Overall, my skin looks so much brighter and more even! What a find!!",

I\u2019ve tried a few different ones in the past and they just made my skin dry and irritated. But this, this is what you want for sensitive skin! I use almost the entire brightening line at this point because my skin loves almost nothing else. I notice a big different in the texture of my skin as well as I break out more often if I don\u2019t use this. It just makes my skin feel more clean. I use it right after cleansing twice a day and will never go back. LOVE this stuff!",

                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of the Andalou toners. This one has a light orange scent, very clean, not chemical at all. The scent lingers a little bit past drying, which I like since I use these sprays to pamper myself a bit throughout the day. It is not particularly moisturizing, but that's not what it's intended to do. The nozzle itself is very nice, it sprays a fine mist evenly without clogging or spitting large droplets at you. As far as the claim that it's brightening I don't see that it really has had that effect on my skin, I think I will stick with the matching serum. I do have breakout prone skin and have not seen any additional breakouts from using this product.*update 4/8/19* I have been using this product for years with no problems. Lately . . . I am breaking out from the spray. Evidently there has been an ingredient change. Also having issues with the spray bottles. The spray from the last bottle (bought in store) was putting out huge heavy drops that got on my shirt or splattered my face, not the nice even spray I've had to date. This current bottle (purchased from Amazon) sprays in a straight line. Which wouldn't be a problem with aerosol as you would just hold and move your hand, but with a push pump you don't have that option. I did try cleaning the nozzle with no relief. I have moved the pump from the old bottle to the current one AGAIN but that nozzle will not last indefinitely. This is less pampering and more frustrating now. I will probably be looking for a new product.",
