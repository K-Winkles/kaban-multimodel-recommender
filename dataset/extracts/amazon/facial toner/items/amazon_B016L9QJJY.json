                "reviewText": "My routine consists of each morning and night I use the cleanser to wash my face, I dry it and use the toner, then the vitamin C serum (just a drop or two is enough!), then the HA serum, let them sit for a minute or two, and then finish with my moisturizer. I don't use make up daily, but when I do I just do my regular makeup after the moisturizer. Honestly I've noticed that since using these I haven't felt the need to use foundation. I don't have flawless skin, but with TruSkin I feel comfortable enough in my own skin that for the most part on a daily basis, I just leave for my office with the moisturizer as my last thing.It's been well over a month since I bought this and have been using this-along with the face cleanser, Vitamin C serum, HA Serum and moisturizer. I have always had skin that breaks out and even other expensive products I've tried haven't worked. They usually clog my skin and make my face either super oily, super dry or just not work at all. As a result I've found that products that the less I use on my face, the better my skin is. I used to have cystic acne some years ago for which I would get facials whenever I could afford them (I was a student in college at the time so had a right budget) but thankfully I found an excellent estestician who did wonders for my skin. She's the one who helped me to learn about my own skin and help me figure out what works and what doesn't. She used to use dermalogica products on me which worked great. Fast forward some years, I'm now living in the south with a different environment than MI weather and I think due to that -or maybe just getting older-I feel dermalogica doesn't work as well on me anymore. As a result I wanted to find products that made my skin look and feel as great as it did each time after my facials.When I moved down here, I found another estetician who recommended a different line, which I tried (was not the cheapest either!) but I didn't like it at all so I asked her for a different recommendation. She told me to try out TruSkin from amazon and see how I liked these -and am I glad I did!I could see and feel the difference almost immediately. TruSkin is truly awesome for my skin. It's made my skin more supple and beautiful. It doesn't look as dull or bleh as it used to. I'm almost 30 and while that's still very young, I had started feeling like my skin needed some love (besides the facials I never really invested in good moisturizers and skin care really). And since I've been using it for about 2-3 months now I can honestly say this is not one of those products that feel good in the beginning week or so and then just does nothing -each time I use these, I feel great!Lastly I have to make a comment about their excellent customer service. By far the best experience I've ever had. I contacted TruSkin to ask if they would be willing to send me a dropper for my HA serum (it comes with a pump) with a reorder of the HA serum which had opened and spilled during travel, and they responded right away saying they would send me the dropper and another bottle of the serum free of charge. I wasn't expecting that at all! I spoke with someone named Erica, who has truly been wonderful (I hope TruSkin recognizes her for her excellent service)! I would-and DO-recommend TruSkin to all my friends! The quality of the product in addition to their customer service has made me a loyal customer!",

                "reviewText": "Final update June 2018:While this product doesn't work for my skin, the quality shows to me in the consistency, and absorption. I love the spray bottle and how the product soaks into the skin, though for me it's some sort of allergy. I'm adding stars for my absolutely positive customer service experience. The company took the time to reach out to me and help me! Because of this, I am a believer in their customer service and will now feel comfortable giving their other products a try. You'll have nothing to lose with this brand, they stand by their name and their customers. Good people!---Update May: Does me more harm than good. Was really hoping this stuff would work, but it must be made for different skin than mine. Those bumps I mentioned before always appear with the use of this and began appearing on my neck, behind, above and under my ear even if avoiding those areas somehow. Causes me dermatitis!Update April 4th:allergy/irritant. This seems to do me OK in my face but not my upper forehead where it begins to become the hair line. Everytime for some reason it becomes red with a few large bumps, like pimples but they never produce substance and eventually dry out. I will not repurchase this stuff because it really doesn't do much for me but I imagine it's a good product for some. I still use it on my face every now and again.Update March 18:I like this stuff however, after a few days use I found it drying and gave me an odd breakout. My dryness came with dry pimples which are a little hard to treat. I will continue using this but not regularly as its too much for my skin. After my break out heals I will use it a few times a week rather than everyday and adjust from there.Seems to be a good toner! I noticed it smells familiar and reminds me a bit of a combo of my Avalon vitC toner and this vitamin (I think B vitamin or maybe placenta) stuff I used to treat my hair with. It's an expected smell for a toner, an OK smell and it works well so far. Slight sting which quickly leaves when drying. Will update!",

                "reviewText": "I just bought my second bottle. The first one lasted me from December until July.I bought this because I wanted vitamin C in my skincare routine, but it\u2019s hard to find it without Vitamin E in the mix. My spouse is allergic to Vitamin E. I honestly was not expecting such a difference. I have always been prone to small but constant breakouts around my nose and mouth area. They are gone now. They came back about a week after my the first bottle ran out, but we\u2019re gone days after my second bottle came.And it requires very little. A spritz or two once or twice a day.",
