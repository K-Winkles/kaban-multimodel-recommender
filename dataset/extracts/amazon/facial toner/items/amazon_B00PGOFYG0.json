                "reviewText": "This is my honest and very detailed review of the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner 180ml. I received this on February 6 2017, and I bought it from the seller Wishtrend. My product was not counterfeit and the shipping was fast because I have Prime. I have been using it for about 4 months now. This product is amazing. If you wish to read the full details of my review please keep reading. I hope this review helps someone :).Pros/ Good:1. Hydrating for a toner!2. Very gentle, it is gentle enough that it didn't irritate my sensitive acne prone skin3. Seems to be great for all skin (my mom and sister tried it and they have different skin then me)4. No fragrance ( artificial fragrance is especially not good for the skin)5. Layers well with other products6. Fast absorbing7. Seems to do what is advertised8. Get a good amount of product for the price9. Packing is simple and nice, and it dispenses well10. My other products seem to absorb better and with no peeling with this tonerCons/ Bad:1. The price may be a turn off to some because it is not exactly really low cost2. Some that like simple ingredient list may not like the long ingredient list this product has ( I don't mind).My skin type: I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to mild acne. My skin reacts terribly to harsh chemicals and fragrances. I have always had clear skin in my teens but for some reason saw mild acne bumps occur on my cheeks ( small 3-4 of them) and I am in my 20s. Sometimes I would get 1-2 deep, pus filled zits. My skin has gotten a lot better since 2 months of use and this has helped ( though not the main reason). To make clear this did not clear up my acne but it did help because hydrated skin is happier skin. What helped my acne overall were probiotics ( and sugar free yogurt) and switching to a low refined carbs and sugar diet, I also consume more fruits and veggies when I can because eating clean is expensive.The Package: I think it is important to pay attention to packaging when purchasing skin care products. The toner comes in a brown cardboard box. The front has an image of the toner, and the coloring is brown and purple with black ink. The writing is in black ink for the majority of the package. The writing is in Korean and english. It states the location of manufacturing. The bottle is made of plastic and is a very dark brown with a black plastic top. The label is placed on the actual bottle and is a ivory or off white color. The text is in Korean and english. It dispenses like a drip, so one drop at a time. It looks legitimate and none counterfeit from my research. Please research all your skincare before purchase.The ingredients list: Main ingredients- sodium hyaluronate, glucan, centella asiatica extract, lipidureOther ingredients: water, butylene glycol, dimethyl sulfone, betaine, caprylic/caprice triglyceride, natto gum, sodium hyaluronate, disodium EDTA, centella asiatica extract, glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) root extract, polyquaternium-51, chlorphenesin, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, panthenol, arginine, luffa cylindrica fruit/leaf/stem extract, beta-glucan, althaea rosea flower extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, hydroxyethylcellulose, portulaca oleracea extract, lysine HCL, proline, sodium Ascorbyl phosphate, acetyl methionine, theanine, lavandula angustifola (lavender) oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (Orange) peel oil, cananga odorata flower oil, copper tripeptide-1How I use it: I do not use this with a cotton pad or a cotton ball because cotton absorbs a lot of the product causing one to use more. If you think you have extra make up on your face and want to wipe it off just incase then a cotton pad/ball would be recommended. However, I use it mainly as a toner after I know all my make up is gone. I wash my hands, dry them and then use a few drops and gently pat it on my face.My experience: This product is a holy grail! The product dispenses really well so I never use to much. The color is clear, it is pretty much odorless, and the texture is a little viscous and not really watery, and none sticky. Like I stated before I have dry skin. I often get dry flaky spots in the winter. I have used toners before and they were all watery and drying. Most toners have an alcohol smell and some irritated my skin or dried it out worst like CosRx toner. I switched to Klairs toner after seeing great reviews. I was skeptical, and the price was not the cheapest if it did not work but I was desperate for hydration so took the risk. I do not regret it! This is as hydrating as a toner can get. It leaves my skin smooth and not tight. It is fast absorbing and layers beautifully under products and no peeling. It does what it advertises and helps remove extra make up. I also notice my products absorb better into my skin when I use this toner, they absorb faster and do not peel ( I use 4-5 products in my skincare routine, including the cleanser). I cannot believe a toner like this exist! No irritation, no dryness so this is a dream!My family experience: My mother and sister tried this product and both love it! My sister has oily skin and my mom combination skin with oily and dry. My sister has moderate acne. My mom clear skin, sensitive, with a few wrinkles around the eyes ( my mom is in her 40s and my sister is in her 20s). They both had no negative reaction to the toner, and they both said it was hydrating. The toner did not peel and layered well for them. It also helped my sister remove her makeup.Overall: I highly recommend this product. This product does everything it advertises and that is remarkable. It is fast absorbing, layers beautifully, hydrating and helps in the removal of make up, gentle enough for sensitive skin. I can't believe this worked and I hope this works for everyone as well! I hope my review helps someone.Update: 9/1/2018- I am almost done with my second bottle since this review and it is still great. My skin still loves this product and as you can see I have only ever purchased 2 bottles! It last a long time and no one has had any adverse effects in my family. My skin has gotten better over all since my probiotics and cleaner eating ( my acne was mainly inflammatory gut issues) but my skin is still sensitive. I still recommend this product for everyone but again do your research before anything. I have sensitive skin but this has helped me, for those with skin sensitive to essential oils or more sensitive than mine than they also released another version of this that contains no essential oils I believe. I have not tried that yet but hope to some day, but Klairs is expensive so I am not sure if that will be anytime soon, however, I love this product so look forward to buying again. Thank you everyone and if anything some how gets worst I will update this review. I hope this helped some :)",

This toner feels soo luxurious and hydrating- I\u2019m a HUGE fan of the scent as well but they also have a scent free version if you prefer that.This is the one. Idk what else to say. It doesn\u2019t strip your skin of anything, feels viscous and thick but absolutely breathable, smells like a dream. Packing is sturdy and cute af, esp next to the DearKlairs cleansing oil.

It's like it fine tunes the other products, if that makes sense to you.
