It absorbs well and leaves my skin glowing and with a nice even complexion.

Feels great on my skin. I use it under day and night creams and it seems to support and maintain hydration of my skin. It has a soothing effect on my skin tone that I really prize. Overall, impressive results for me.",

                "reviewText": "While this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Heaven Water is a bit pricey, you do get a really large bottle of this skin-nourishing product, so it should last you a while. It contains a high concentration of various peptides, which help one\u2019s skin to rejuvenate and stimulate collagen growth. Paired with an exfoliation scrub, I find this Heaven Water soothing to the touch. I pat it onto my skin and let it absorb completely then layer my other skin care products on top of it without any trouble at all. Just knowing the peptides are at work, I\u2019m content using this simple, barrier-forming, peptide-rich Heaven Water.",

Also smooths my skin and seems to have a healthy looking glow afterward. I really like the ingredients of it and how nice it feels and my skin looks with it. I feel pretty confident with long-term, consistent use there will be more results to come. The smell is nice and soft",

I have been using this toner for 2 weeks and it has really helped my flaky skin heal. It smells and feels wonderful on the face. I have been using Shiseido for years and this is honestly on par in terms of quality. I honestly would buy this again. It is worth every penny. Highly recommended.",
