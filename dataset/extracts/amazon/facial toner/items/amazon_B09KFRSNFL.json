After using it for over a month I\u2019ve grown to really like it! I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been more consistent with my skincare but my acne has gotten a lot better and I truly believe this does a great job. I just bought my second bottle and honestly can\u2019t see myself switching to another toner anytime soon. The price and the quality of the item is what keeps me coming back.",
