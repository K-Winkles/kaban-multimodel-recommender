The box clearly says Canada but why is there a sticker on the box that says made in China? That just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. Also, the box did not have any cellophane wrapper over it, and the bottle did not have any type of safety seal on it either. This always is a bit of concern for me because you can never be sure if something was tampered with. I did a little patch test on my arm before using it on my face the first time.I\u2019ve been using this at night after cleansing my face. My skin feels so refreshed afterwards. It even gets off traces of my makeup that my cleanser might leave behind. There is a slight pleasant scent to the product when it\u2019s in the bottle but not noticeable when I put it on my face. There is absolutely no skin irritation from it. It says on the box that your skin may be more sensitive to the sun since it contains alpha hydroxy acid. I follow it up with my usual serum and a thick moisturizer and my skin is so soft when I wake up.",

All anyone has to do is look online and compare ingredients, which, BTW, they 100% match. As you can see from my photos, the ingredients on the box match the ingredients on Ordinary\u2019s website.I\u2019ve used this before, but it\u2019s been over a year. It\u2019s good to switch your skin care regimen regularly because using the same product over and over tends to run its course eventually. Each season, I choose new products and products I\u2019ve used before.I will only use this product during the summer months because I tend to sweat more, which helps keep my pores clean. I also only use it at night. My skin during the winter tends to be dryer and a bit sensitive, which isn\u2019t good with that type of skin.This toner helps keep my skin\u2019s sebum balanced. The results are no blackheads or pimples.EXPIRATION DATE: UPON OPENING!I always check for an expiration date before using, ESPECIALLY with health & beauty products. This product does not have one, which means the expiration is between 12-18 months UPON OPENING.This toning resurfacing solution is exactly as advertised, and works well. The PRICE is in the usual range.",

                "reviewText": "I have some concerns about this product. If you just look at the packaging in which this comes, it seems authentic. However, it came unsealed which is odd. Also, the product listing shows a bottle very similar to those shown on The Ordinary website, but missing the product name on the label. If it's real, why isn't the product name shown on the label on the product listings? It looks like it's been digitally edited. The product that arrived at my house had a very genuine looking label. The box looked good also, but it also included a sticker that said \"made in China\". I actually wonder if this is a genuine the Ordinary product that has been opened and diluted? Another possibility is that this is older stock. The Ordinary changed the name of the toner from \"toning solution\" to \"exfoliating toner\". This label says \"toning solution\" so maybe this is just sold by a clearance house for older stock? Honestly, the toner seems pretty good. It hasn't bothered my skin and it does seem to exfoliate well and soften my skin. I just have some reservations about continued use due to authenticity questions, and I certainly won't order from this distributer again without some sort of clarification.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using The Ordinary\u2019s 7% glycolic acid toner for several years now, and it has become an essential part of my skincare routine. The benefits I've experienced from incorporating this product into my daily regimen are truly remarkable. Unfortunately, my experience with this particular order has left me with some authenticity concerns.As a longtime user of this product, I have gone through many bottles of this toner, so I couldn't help but notice several discrepancies that raised red flags. I first noticed the bottle is different on this one, and that led me to take a closer look. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the seal under the cap was missing, a clear departure from the standard implemented by The Ordinary.Another notable difference was the unexpected floral scent of this toner. Having used the authentic product for years, I can attest that the original version is fragrance-free. The addition of a floral scent in this toner is not only inconsistent with the genuine product but also raises concerns about the use of unauthorized ingredients.Perhaps the most concerning revelation was the discrepancy in the place of manufacture. The authentic glycolic acid toner by The Ordinary is made in Canada, as indicated on the box. However, this product had a label stating it was made in China. This inconsistency in origin is a clear indication that the product may not be genuine.In conclusion, the combined discrepancies raise concerns about the authenticity of the product. This order was definitely not what I expected.",
