Very easy to work into your face care routine and it works well with other products. I feel that it is well priced for what you get as this bottle will last a long time. Would recommend.",

There is just a hint of a scent so nothing over powering, which I like, as many toners have such a sharp, alcohol smell to them and can be irritating. There is no sting when applying and I have been using it after a cleanser and many times i just rock the toner through the day and at night after washing my face I follow it up with my night time moisturizer. It leaves my skin smooth and very clean feeling which for me with my combination skin is a huge plus, and it leaves me with a nice refreshed feeling. I have some really dry spots on my forehead and this seems to have really helped with extra hydration.",

It's very mild, and I have not had any skin sensitivity, breakouts, redness, etc. Yay!This toner is watery, with low non-offensive scent. It's not quite 'no scent', but there aren't any weird chemical, artificial or strong odors.The bottle is plastic, but you can squeeze it just a little to administer the product. Ofc, if you squeeze too hard, it goes all over. That only happened once when I was not paying attention.All-in-all, I'm really happy with this toner. It's exactly what I've veen looking for (I used to use Muji's mild toner, but its too hard to get now). I will purchase this one again in the future.",

I apply with a reusable microfiber cotton round.I have very sensitive skin and also sensitive to certain smells. Straight up tea tree oil is strong so I was nervous that this was going to be very potent smelling. It has a very subtle scent that dissipates quickly.No irritation and doesn\u2019t dry out my skin. I follow up with a light coating of moisturizer.Very happy with his toner so far.",

Lots of blackheads, whiteheads and redness. I needed something that would sooth my skin from breakout. I used this toner after using adapalene face wash. This toner didn't irritate my skin and removed some left over dirt that the face wash didn't get. My face didn't feel tight after use, and felt clean. I will have to use for a couple to weeks to see if this toner works, but so far so good, I have used it morning and night.",
