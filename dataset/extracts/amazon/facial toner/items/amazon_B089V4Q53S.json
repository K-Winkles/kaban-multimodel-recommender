This is super thick and leaves my skin feeling not quite squeaky clean (as I\u2019d usually get from an astringent), but I\u2019m not mad because the results still looks great. Also the applicator is so so so great.I have obnoxious skin, and my pregnancy has caused nonstop breakouts that NO PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RELIEVE. Except this one. I looked in the mirror at work this morning and my pores almost looked BLURRED, like I had a filter on ??? And 6 months into my pregnancy I finally see a GLOW.Along with consistent face washing with a gentle cleanser, my skin is on a great track to actually being better without makeup.Well done.",

No matter how hard I clean and sanitize my helmet straps and headset- and my face, I always seem to break out on my jawline and under my chin, coupled with good ol hormonal breakouts once a month.I've tried all the hacks and gone thru the motions and potions and this one kind of edged all the others out for me.It cleared things up, quickly, and keeps things clear. I waited for some sort of purge at the 2 week mark, it was miniscule, if that. What was once a complicated routine of 6-9 products that ended with stickering my face with at least a dozen zit patches has now decreased to a gentle cleanser and this serum. I bought another one because I love this product so much.",

                "reviewText": "I hope this doesn\u2019t jinx it but this stuff literally single-handedly fixed my skin. I saw results after the first use and continue to see them weeks later. I have oily, acne-prone skin and since I\u2019ve started using this I\u2019ve had almost no new blemishes. I would also get these tiny little bumps on certain parts of my face and this has cleared them away. I feel like my skin looks smoother and brighter. I use it morning and night and haven\u2019t had any irritation or dryness. I don\u2019t feel like it controls oil but that\u2019s fine for me as it wasn\u2019t my main concern. I was put off at first by the texture because it\u2019s a bit thicker than I\u2019m used to, but I just use it more like a serum than a toner. In my experience if you try to pump it directly onto a cotton pad it will kind of squish out everywhere; I saw someone recommend pumping some out with your fingers then tipping it onto the pad and that\u2019s worked for me. It\u2019s seriously amazing, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this product the fact they've merged a toner and serum into one and its gentle has my attention! The pump works fine I found the texture a little daunting the first two uses however what I found helpful was to pump approx 1/\u00b2 pump onto the pump then tip the gel onto clean fingers or a cotton round once I get it on I slightly fold the cotton round in half without squeezing it so the gel 'sticks' and then I swipe. Sounds like a process but it's barely a 2 second action. I find that it helps it spread much better across the face because it's covering more of the cotton round and it isn't slippery. I don't find there to be any overpowering scent or irritation. Having reactive sensitive skin this is a rare find for me. I would recommend this to anyone but even more so to those younger people with acne or blackheads as it is still so gentle. Even if you're just applying it directly on the affected areas only I'm sure you will see results without further damage to your skin.",
