Omg I love that I bought these items!First of all I did feel a bit of burning, around the mouth and I was burnt so I allowed my skin to heal and try again but using less of it and immediately following up with a moisturizer.I use the retinol 3 times and weak and the vitamin c daily. It's amazing. I start with a cleaning foam, followed by a toner, then the vitamin c, let it dry, then retinol let that dry then moisturizer. I bought it in August and didn't start seeing results until October. Guys, pace yourself slow down and be patient. Btw I have combination skin and I never leave my house without a sunscreen... Always use a sun screen!!!",
