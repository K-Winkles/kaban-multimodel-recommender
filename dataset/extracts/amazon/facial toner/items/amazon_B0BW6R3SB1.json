I love this toner, it is gentle, cleanses well and helps prep my face for skin care. I usually use this with a cotton ball, but I do like to put some in a spray bottle and mist on my face. It works well both ways and is non drying and doesn't make my face greasy. Just feels clean and fresh. The bottle is pretty big and a good deal from what I used to buy for less product. I am a fan of the ingredients and quality, this is great for sensitive and blemish prone skin. I do not notice any scent and there is no fragrance in the formula.",
