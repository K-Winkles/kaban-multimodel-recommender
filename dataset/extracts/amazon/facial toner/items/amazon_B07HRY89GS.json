                "reviewText": "UPDATE:Buy this rosewater now. Make sure you use every single morning and night. I would have never believed the difference in my skin after continued use. The softness and smoothness to my skin feels unbelievable. I have heard of rosewater my entire life and had never even attempted to use. Well, I am a believer. I have been without rosewater and with rosewater and the difference is just something you will have to experience for yourself. I would have never thought it, but the three dark spots I have on my face are beginning to lighten significantly. The smoothness just blows me away. I plan to keep using regularly as part of my morn and night skincare routine. IT REALLY DOES MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. Also, don't waste your money buying a more expensive rosewater. The amount you receive and the benefits, cannot be compared to other brands. It is unbelievable how good Eclat products are. The price is wonderful and the products really do what they say they will do. Give it time and it will work for you. The key is to USE CONSISTENTLY.This product is unbelievably good. When I first received, I was shaking the liquid on a round cotton pad and just applying all over my face. For some reason, I was just ok with it. I read on Amazon where a lady said she just shook the liquid out in her hand and applied directly to the skin. I started doing that on the third of fourth time I used the product. The very first night I used like this, I was so amazed at how I felt. Doing this way made all the difference. My skin felt saturated with the product, felt refreshed and the softness, which came after it dried down, wow wow wow. So, I have been doing this for about 2 weeks or more and I can tell u, something has changed with my skin. This product is from Eclat, and I am also using their Vit C serum, Retinol serum & their anti-wrinkle face cream. My skin simply looks better. I was using the other products about a month before I started using the Rose Water Tonic. But this morn I took a mirror and got really up close to my face and yes, there wS a difference. To which of these products do I owe this to, well, I don't know. Maybe a combo of all of them. I really cannot say a bad thing about any of these products, but just the opposite. I will review them separately. The only thing I dislike about this company, so far, is that I ordered the Retinol cream to be applied at night, over the Retinol serum. I used one jar, loved it and wanted to order another. EXCEPT the pager where u would order the product, said that it was out of stock and didn't know when it would come back in stocks or if it would ever come back in stock. So, I do not want this to happen with a product if I am pleased and feel good about using it. SO, I WILL SAY I AM NOW HESITANT TO KEEP ORDERING WHAT I AM USING BECAUSE NEXT TIME, IT MAY BE ANOTHER PRODUCT I AM CRAZY ABOUT. Other than this, I love the Eclat products. I highly recommend the Rose Water Tonic and all the others I have listed.",

Nach der Reinigung auf der Haut nur ein paar Tropfen verteilen und schon hat man ein wunderbar frisches Hautgef\u00fchl. Gerne wieder.",

                "reviewTitle": "Un MUST HAVE!!!!",
                "reviewText": "Ho voluto testare questo prodotto perch\u00e9 si descrive come un tonico adatto ad ogni tipo di pelle e quindi adatto anche alle pelli miste/grasse come la mia. Tutti sappiamo che chi ha questo tipo di pelle ha purtroppo un eccesso di sebo e ovviamente pori dilatati, io ho anche qualche \"cicatrice\" da brufolo e qualche rossore, come potete vedere dalla prima foto del viso si notano le descrizioni soprastanti. Basta applicare qualche goccia sul un dischetto di cotone e passarlo delicatamente su tutto il viso evitando il contorno occhi. Si descrive come un ottimo astringente e seboregolatore. Io ho notato un grande cambiamento sotto questo aspetto, ma per quanto riguarda i rossori non tanto. Comunque credo sia diventata dipendente da questo tonico, perch\u00e9 ha un buonissimo profumo alle rose non invadente e poi ti lascia la pelle liscia, luminosa e fresca. Che dire... un MUST HAVE per la skincare routine.",
