My sister also tried this, and she really liked it. This toner isn\u2019t uncomfortable, it doesn\u2019t make your skin rubbery, it isn\u2019t sticky. Sometimes, this toner goes on sale for around 16 dollars instead of 20 on amazon, so be sure to watch out for those sales! The only guaranteed time that it\u2019ll be on sale is events like Black Friday and prime day. But be warned- some people\u2019s skin get clogged by rice products, so it\u2019s wise to get the mini first! Also, this toner is for dry skin, mostly, but for combo, you can put it on specific areas on your face. I don\u2019t put this toner on my forehead. This is fragrance free, so don\u2019t worry about the scent.",

                "reviewText": "I love this toner! It\u2019s an emulsion of water and oil and basically turns into a milky texture once you shake it. It\u2019s supposed to be shaken before use. It feels so soothing on my face and gives me an immediate glow. For reference, I use this in the morning after my morning cleanse. I just pour some in the palm of my hands and pat it onto my face. It\u2019s milky but since it is an emulsion with oil, it\u2019s expected to leave a bit of an oily feel on the skin that I absolutely love. It\u2019s not greasy, or oily per se, just a refreshing emulsion. After some time, the oil sinks into the skin and gets absorbed leaving me with toned and glowy skin. I have sensitive skin and this toner works very well for me. I also have mild rosacea and it hasn\u2019t irritated my skin. It\u2019s soothing and I look forward to using it every morning. It\u2019s also oddly moisturizing, especially if you do the \u201c7 layer skin method\u201d. I tried it once with this toner just for fun and it gave me the most radiant skin and was very hydrating.",

                "reviewText": "I've recently gotten into Korean skincare because of TikTok, and while I was doing my research, this was one of the toners that kept popping up. So, I decided to take a leap of faith and order it, and it's one of the best toners I've ever used! In my opinion, as somebody who does get pimples and minor breakouts, this doesn't necessarily help with acne or acne prevention. This offers more hydration and a healthy glow to your skin. So, if you have acne-prone skin or if you get minor pimples, I recommend having a solid ACNE SPECIFIC routine first before incorporating this into your routine! But, overall, I do recommend this toner. I'm on my second bottle already! \ud83e\udef0",

I suggest putting it on with your hands so you don\u2019t waste product. It\u2019s watery but you can apply it easily with your hands. I would definitely buy this again.",

Would buy again.Be sure to shake the bottle before use to evenly distribute ingredients.",
