                "reviewText": "My skin: early 40's, combination skin that is incredibly sensitive and reacts to practically everything. I steer clear of anything with fragrances added, both so that I don't trigger a skin reaction and to avoid headaches, eye reactions, etc.My favorite moisturizer until now was a Korean brand that's about 3 times as expensive as this for the same size bottle, so I was always on the lookout for something to replace it. And this is it!After about 4-5 months of using it I can say:It's not too heavy, but not too light either, so I feel like I'll be able to use it year round with no problems.Absorbs fast! I live in the south and haven't had any instances of it feeling like it's melting off my face when I take the dog for a walk right after doing my skincare routine. (I do put sunscreen on over it, but thankfully they play nice together without it feeling like i've got a ton of product on my face.)You don't need to use a lot so it lasts a decent amount of time despite the size of the bottle.Has no scent, and most importantly triggered no reactions whatsoever for me. I also didn't need to wait for my skin to \"get used to it\", it works for me the same now as it did when I first bought it, which is kind of rare for me.So if you're sensitive I suggest giving it a try! At the very least if it manages to not be right for you, you at least haven't spent $20+ to try it out.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Mi used to to use the biore daily detox with cannabis sativa in it and that was amazing. It got rid of all texture and cleaned out my pores. They discontinued that and I tried this one. Right away I noticed it felt like it was stinging my face And by the end of the week I had a little breakouts. I am sensitive to most products and suffer from very mild rosacea so this was just one of the products that does not agree with my sensitive skin. So if you have similar issues, I do recommend staying away from this product . Also not a fan of the smell. The best way I could describe it is that it kind of smells like clay",
