The aloe in the formula helps to soothe any redness or irritation, and the scent is very pleasant and subtle. I use it both in the morning and throughout the day as a pick-me-up, and it never leaves my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy way to give their skin a boost of hydration!",

This one seems to provide the same hydration as the best I've used and I really like the rose scent. You only smell the rose scent when you first spray it, not on your skin, but it is such a pleasant addition to my daily routine. This product is priced well. My only quibble is with the quality of the spray bottle it comes in. I put mine into a better spray bottle and now it's perfect.",
