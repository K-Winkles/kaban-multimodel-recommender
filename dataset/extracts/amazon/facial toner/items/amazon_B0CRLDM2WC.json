This bubble toner is amazing! I pump once or twice into my fingers, pat on my face, and am done! No pads or cotton balls needed or wasted again! No toner running down my wrists or neck wasted!This is a toner, so I wasn't expecting it to be super hydrating. That's not the point of a toner. But as a woman with dry skin, I was hoping it wouldn't make my skin worse. It's perfect for dry skin! No flakes or redness anywhere! Skin barrier perfectly preserved!Absolutely love this!",

I think this should be up front on the site.Expiration date is 09/26.It has a light scent, which may be attributed to the prickly pear. It's foamy when pumped. A little goes a long way, because it's quite watery in texture and in feel. It seems to make a barrier on my skin, but my skin does not feel any softer from it. It wasn't irritating.",

But it\u2019s not a soap like you would think. This is a product that foams and you just rub in and leave on. No rinsing off. The foaming action helps to spread it evenly without wasting any of the product. And no need for cotton pads to apply it with or waste product. Genius. It soaks into your skin quite nicely with no sticky residue leaving a gently moisturized feeling behind. The label says to test for irritation, but I haven\u2019t experienced any issues. The scent is very light, but I wouldn\u2019t call it scent-free. Overall, I like this product and I\u2019m glad I decided to give it a try. Definitely recommend!",
