I\u2019ve gone through 3 bottles of this already and would be very sad were the formula ever to be changed or discontinued. It smells great, tightens and tones while moisturizing and making my skin feel hydrated and primed. I use it in the morning and at night after washing my face and before applying other products in my skincare routine or makeup. I recently also tried the mango seed ceramide moisturizing oil from this product line and also love that as an addition to my routine!",

Whenever I use other moisturizers, my skin absorbs it too fast and then I\u2019m left with dry face all day within a few hours of application. This one keeps my skin moisturized all day long and it smells so good. My sister has tried this product before also, but she has normal to combination skin and slightly on the sensitive side, not acne prone, but definitely gets breakouts consistently once a month. She said it felt like it was stinging her skin. I don\u2019t recommend it for people with sensitive skin. But I definitely recommend it for those who are on the drier side and don\u2019t have any skin sensitivity issues.",
