Two hours after application, but it does not look greasy. I would suggest applying it with your hands rather than a cotton round to get the most use out of this in the beginning I was using a cotton round but the product was running out very fast. This is also thicker than a traditional cleansing toner. My suggestion would be one to two drops on the palm, and then spreading it on the face.",

It's super good, hydrating, works well to heal skin, I've actually used it on my tattoos (after they've healed) and made my skin super smooth and smoothed down any acne that may be forming. I've loved this product soo much I've bought it 5 times. Then I found something even better, the etude moistfull collagen toner. If I thought this product was a 10/10 then that one is an 11/10. It's even better and just as hydrating. Both products are scent free, nonstick, works well for sensitive skin, and quite affordable. I love etude for their makeup and skincare but now I'm even more impressed with them. I highly recommend trying them both.",
