Overall this is a good toner to use but I recommend using only 2 times a week for beginners because you can over exfoliate if you\u2019re using more that just this product, & trust me it\u2019s not that fun. But anyways this is a good product and is a staple in my skincare routine!",

                "reviewText": "i\u2019ve always struggled with bad acne and when i got on BC, my acne worsened, especially my hormonal cystic acne. Not to mention i have fairly sensitive skin. I\u2019ve tried countless face washes, toners, moisturizers, spot creams and NOTHING was working. i even changed my curology prescription. i\u2019ve used the pimple patches from this brand and absolutely love them. When i had ordered them they came with a sample spot treatment. i gave it a try and it was one of the first spot treatments EVER that seemed to work almost overnight. that\u2019s what led me to trying this toner.It\u2019s lightweight (kinda just feels like water) and comes in a spray bottle which is amazing for easy application. i do a few sprays on my face and lightly rub it in w my fingertips to make sure my face is evenly coated and then let it air dry. and let me tell you this is by far my FAV toner i\u2019ve ever used and i\u2019ve only used it for abt a month or two. There\u2019s no excessive stinging or drying out my skin and it helped with redness and inflammation just after 1 use. My cystic acne has started to clear up AMAZINGLY. i mostly only have slight hyperpigmentation (which it\u2019s also helped with) from where pimples used to be but no current massive, active pimples on my face. if you\u2019re thinking of trying this i would 100% recommend giving it a go. i just started using a few other products from this brand as well and so far so good :)",

It is moisturizing/misty, and then soaks into your skin so your skin feels dry (but not in a bad way) afterwards, just moisturize as needed afterwards!",

                "reviewText": "Cosrx has been a line that I have been falling in love recently. After trying out this product for over a month, I can safely say that this toner is not an exception. First thing first, the purging process takes a while. For me, it took me about over a month. Any pimples or bumps should go away within the day or a few. If not then maybe this product can't work for you but it did wonders on my skin. My skin now feels even better than before and as soft and smooth as a baby. I would highly recommend any of my friends and people I know about this product since it's so much more affordable than some of the high-end brands that I have tried in the past! This toner is my all time favorite along with the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner and the Cosrx moisture pads (these last two are mostly for hydration)!Shipping was relatively fast since I have Prime and the packaging was in pristine shape. Nothing to complain about there.How I use this toner: I use this toner morning and night. In the morning, I like to spray it directly onto my face after I clean it since my skin tends to be more sensitive in the morning. I gently pat it in for a few mins until it is fully absorbed into my skin, I then proceed with my moisturizer and sunscreen. At night I double cleanse (BTW never dry your face with your towel, even if you're just tapping your face with the towel. There are many unknown and harmful bacteria that could have been attached to your towel so be careful! Personally, I like to just pat the excess water into my skin.). I then use a different hydrating toner on a cotton pad all over my face to remove any excess makeup or cleanser that remains. And of course to hydrate my face! Afterward, I take a different cotton pad and spray this clarifying toner on it, focusing it on areas that I tend to have clogged pores to help break down any oils that reside (Basically, almost my whole face). I proceed with my essence, treatments,serum, oil, and moisturizer.I hope this was somewhat helpful!",
