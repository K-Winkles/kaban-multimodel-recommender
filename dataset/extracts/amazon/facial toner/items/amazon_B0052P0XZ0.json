For reference, I have somewhat oily skin and am not sensitive to skincare products apart from those containing benzoyl peroxide.I'm a huge fan of this toner! The smell may take some getting used to if you're not used to hemp products - it's somewhat grassy/earthy, but that is to be expected :) The smell does fade away as the toner dries. Usually I let the toner air dry after spritzing it on my face, which can take a few minutes. (I read a negative review that mentioned a defective spray mechanism, but I have not found that to be true with any of my purchases.)My skin feels much more refreshed and moisturized after having used this product for the last few months. I think that sometimes it can take time to see positive results in terms of skin healing/rejuvenation; but I will say that after six months my skin appears more much more even. I've gotten compliments about my complexion for the first time in my life, and I think this toner has a lot to do with that!I would recommend this toner to anyone who prefers using natural products and doesn't struggle with sensitive skin issues, as I'm honestly not sure how this toner will respond. Personally I am hooked on this product and plan on trying more from this line very soon!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great toner. I love that it balances the PH in your skin and prepares you for the next steps in your beauty routine. I am 29 and have been struggling with highly sensitive, dehydrated yet oily skin and have been on a facial journey over the past 9 months. Everything I tried either hurt my face, made the problem worse, or was just \"ok.\" The Aging line from Andalou Naturals has been a skin-saver! I returned the high-end Sephora products I was using after using this line for only a week. It has healed my skin. My skin is clearer, softer, happier, healthier, and \"glowier.\" I will continue purchasing these products. You can't beat the careful ingredients or the price! My only \"complaint\" with this product is that I don't really like the spray nozzle. I originally started with the travel kit and really prefer that top and pouring this product onto a reusable facial cloth. I feel that it's more helpful in removing any traces of makeup residue and cleaning pores.My skin care routine is as follows: daytime - Probiotic Cleansing Milk (this product), Blossom+Leaf Toning Refresher, Gogi Peptide Cream, BB Cream. Nightime - (after removing makeup with Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser) Probiotic Cleansing Milk (this product), Blossom+Leaf Toning Refresher, Turmeric+C Enlighten Serum, Resveratol Q10 Night Repair Cream.*all products Andalou Naturals, other than the Bliss Makeup Melt",
