I use this product as a toner in the AM and PM, and I love that it can be used prior to actives like Salicylic acid and retinol as well.I definitely see an improvement in my skin texture + the improvement in complexion that comes with consistent niacinamide usage. I just need 4-5 drops for my entire face, and I believe this 150 ml bottle will last me at least close to a year.Definitely a holy grail for me and I will be repurchasing!",
