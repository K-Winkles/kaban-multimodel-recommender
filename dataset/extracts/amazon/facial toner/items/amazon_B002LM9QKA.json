My skin is definitely sensitive and prone to breakouts but this helps keep things calm, especially around my nose and chin. I use with the round exfoliating pads.",

                "reviewText": "I'm in my early 50's and I suffered more acne in the last 2 years than I ever did as a teen. I have spent hundreds if not more between facials and expensive products for my face. Some of them seemed to work at first but then my face almost seemed worsted than before. My doctor even gave me antibiotics. I took them for a month and then stopped taking them. They helped but were never able to return my face and skin to normal. I suffered from a lot of deep acne along my jaw line. My nose and cheeks just hurt all the time. I changed my diet and washed my pillow case 2 times a week and changed laundry soaps. My face would be dry as a bone for 2 weeks and slick with oil the next 2 weeks. On spots where I had tried to dry out a painful zit the skin was dry and flaky.Thayers rose petal Witch Hazel with aloe Vera has worked better than everything ! I use it several times a day. If I have to get up at night I grab a quick pad with Thayers and use it. My skin feels the same every day now. Soft and smooth but not oily. No flaking from dry skin. Break outs are less and when I do they are easy to deal with. My pores do seem smaller and I seem to have less blackheads. It smells wonderful to me. I have even had friends ask me what new perfume I'm wearing because they love it. My youngest daughter who is 17 uses it all the time now also. She was having trouble with acne also but her face is clear now too. Iwe can both now go out with out make up and don't feel bad about our skin anymore. I have been using it for about 2 months now and my face and skin is significantly better. Acne 95% to 98% gone and breakouts less frequency. If I do break out I use several times a day and it dries them out quickly. Before I would big red lumps or welts under my skin that could take a week or longer before they went away.* I have used other brands of witch hazel with alcohol but they just dried my skin and it didn't show any improvement.IMPORTANT- at each use I use at least 2 disposable pads. I wipe one side of my face with one side then flip it and use the other side. When my face dries. I do it again. I don't want to smear the oil and dirt the pad picked up. It doesn't leave a film on my skin and my skin doesn't feel sticky. I also don't seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.",

I had a very large pimple on my forehead that kept filling up and I couldnt get rid of it for months but using this toner has gotten rid of the ugly thing and it hasnt come back. All of Thayers products are very good and while I know most of us would look to a more feminine looking product rather than a plain bottle of stuff with a bearded man on it, jst try one bottle and I am sure you will be glad you did.. I use the rosewater scent one with alow vera. Love, love, LOVE it. TRY IT!!!",

                "reviewText": "I'm attaching photos, the first in the grey is the before, the second in the black is the after.Before comparing these pictures, I didn't think that this formula was doing much for me. Then I realized that my face does look brighter and more even. There is a distinct blemish that I've had on the right side of my face (near my mole) that has been bothering me for a while. I was distracted because I continued to break out while using this product. After reading some of the other reviews, I was under the impression that this product might also help to stop my breakouts. It made me break out more along my jawline in the beginning, but I think I can chalk that up to my skin getting used to it.As a toner, this product does what it says it does. I would caution people prone to breakouts that they will probably breakout more for the first week or so and then it should go back to normal, if not better. I can now see that scars/blemishes on my face have decreased in visibility. This is a good, natural product.I swear I've been staring at that blemish since I got it and now it's leaving, slowly but surely! I am giving it 4 stars right now because it did make me break out on places that I don't usually have problems with anymore...I'm hoping that this symptom goes away. The biggest side effect is that my skin seems to have more little bumps along my jaw and cheek line. Though they aren't necessarily visible, it's changed the smoothness of my skin. I'd say it takes away dark spots, and is a little irritating at first.The good news is that I can wait for small pumps and pimples to leave relatively soon. My skin scars easily, so those marks are harder to deal with. This product has really helped me :)",
