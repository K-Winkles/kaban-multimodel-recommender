                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars really wonderful for dry skin in wintertime",
                "reviewText": "I love toners, but I am trying to move beyond the alcohol-laden ones you find at the drugstore, especially this winter since it is super dry here and my skin is drying out all over. I've started using this one recently and I am really liking it a lot. I think this is best for normal to dry skin, or for use during the winter. (I typically have combination/oily skin, but there is something about winter this year that is making me super dry.)Here are the ingredients (you can see them on the product page if you zoom in on one of the images, but they are hard to read there):Purified Water, Aloe Barbadensis, Coenzyme Q10, Hyaluronic Acid, Chamomile, Sage, Carica Papaya Leaf Extract, Cucumber Extract, Citrus Aurantium Flower Oil, Phenoxyethanol And Ethylhexylglycerin Both Derived From Natural Sources.This is natural and Leaping Bunny certified, if either of those are important to you. This is relatively thin and non-viscous with a slight yellow color. It does have a scent, but the scent is from the natural extracts and oils and I find it quite pleasant (it is not herbal, medicinal, or floral, not exactly, anyway, but maybe a combination of all three?).The aloe and hyaluronic acid are moisturizing and I find that chamomile and cucumber in skincare are generally quite soothing. CoQ10 *may* contribute to skin firmness. I do feel that there was some toning or astringent benefit upon use, and this doesn't have the typical toning ingredients (e.g., no witch hazel), so perhaps there is some truth to that. CoQ10 is also an antioxidant and helps fight free radical damage, so this would be good to use after sun exposure (don't go without a good SPF product, too) or over the long term for anti-aging benefits. And papaya leaf extract has some antioxidants and antimicrobial effects.Please note: This comes in a glass bottle and the top of mine did not look like the official product image. (Mine did not have a pump. Rather, you pushed down on one part of the top to raise an opening on the other side, then upend the bottle and pour. The product flows very nicely so no worries about not being able to squeeze the bottle.)Overall, I'm a fan. This is probably going to be my go-to winter toner for a long time!",

I love this brand and how they use clean ingredients.This toner leaves my skin feeling moisturized and is a great first step after cleansing. It creates a layer that locks in moisture and is great to use with hyaluronic acid.The only downside is the mister is pretty intense. I would advise not to use to set makeup because it can leave large water bubbles on your face and ruin your makeup.Highly recommend!",
