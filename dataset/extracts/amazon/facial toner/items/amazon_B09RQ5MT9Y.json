                "reviewText": "Updated review: Previously I wrote a bad review for this toner because it irritated my dry and sensitive skin. Using it every day was a no-go for me. After I bought my usual toner, I realized I missed the exfoliation from this toner! Now I rotate this with my fenty fat water every other day and have found better results than if I were to use just one on its own. So if you have sensitive skin, maybe yse only a few times a week and other days use a more hydrating or gentle toner. I ended up using all of my first bottle despite my initial impression and am back to buy more!----------Original review: I wanted to try out a new toner and bought this one because of the positive reviews and clean ingredients. I used it for a month and was having skin irritation and acne beyond what is normal for me. I chalked it up to other recent lifestyle changes, but then tried using my usual toner again the other day and my skin cleared up within 24hrs. I must be sensitive or allergic to something in this product I wasn't aware of. I will stick to my fenty fat water from now on. I have very sensitive skin and that stuff is very soothing and does wonders. This dime stuff is not it.",
