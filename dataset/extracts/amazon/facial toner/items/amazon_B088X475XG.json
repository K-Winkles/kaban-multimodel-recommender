                "reviewText": "My skin has never looked so clear, so hydrated and luminous...even glassy. It is bouncy to the touch, and I swear, it is so glowy it must nearly be bioluminescent! And I'm pretty sure it's all thanks to Hayejin Blessing of Sprout Radiance Toner. I read about the Korean Seven Skin Method a few weeks ago and how it could give me that glowy skin we all want. Intrigued, I knew I needed to find just the right product to try it, and that's when I found Hayejin Blessing of Sprout Radiance Toner. In case you aren't familiar with the method, it is very easy to do. You just apply layer after layer after layer of one or more hydrating toner products or essences, lightly patting each layer into your skin before moving on to the next. This Hayejin toner/essence is PERFECT for the Seven Skin Method! This product is somewhat viscous, with a consistency just a little thicker than water. I prefer to pour a small amount into my palm, wet my fingers, then press them to my face, sort of pushing the essence into my skin. I wait 30 to 60 seconds between layers. I love everything about this stuff. It comes in a nice, heavy frosted glass bottle that looks and feels good in hand but isn't frilly or fussy. The scent is very light, but pleasant, and my skin drinks it up thirstily. This toner isn't cheap, but I have used products by other brands that cost a lot more and do a lot less. I will definitely repurchase this stuff, probably forever, and I will certainly be on the lookout for other products by Hayejin. I mean, seriously...if the TONER is this good, I can't even imagine how amazing the rest of the product line must be! Any more radiance and I'm pretty sure I'll glow in the dark!I get so excited about this toner that I very nearly forgot to mention one of my favorite things about it: Not only are all Hayejin products made from natural, botanical ingredients, they are also all vegan and completely cruelty-free! It truly is a brand that is beautiful inside and out. If you can afford this product, buy it now! It might just be the best thing you ever do for your skin. It is absolutely worth its price. It's one of the best beauty products I have EVER used, and I really think you will love it, too!I hope my experience with this product might help YOU make a more informed purchase. Happy shopping!",

                "reviewText": "As I get past that much dreaded Middle Age, I have begun religiously practice good daily skincare regimen. This involves using quality skincare products from a facial cleanser, to eventually some sorts of anti-aging night cream or serum. Often, like many out there, I skimp on the toner for years in between these two; which is a big mistake. A good toner is an important step as it removes any last traces of dirt, grime and impurities stuck in our pores after we wash our face. When added to our daily skincare routine and used regularly, it can have major positive impact on the appearance and tightness of your pores (hello, aging skin).After cleansing, skincare should always be applied lightest to heaviest (with the exception of SPF which always comes last). So because of its water-like consistency, toner is meant to be applied immediately after cleanser and before serums, moisturizers, and oils.Why I Love this Toner?\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d This HAYEJIN Korea Blessing of Sprout Radiance Vitality Toner is made in Korea, pretty much the de facto Skincare Capital of Asia, is an amazing all-in-one toner that's not too heavy, and easy to apply to my skins after my facial cleansing step in preparation my skins for the subsequent anti-aging skincare products, so that my skins get the very best benefits from Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen often found in the night creams or serums around my eyes where wrinkles & fine lines popped up. This vegan radiance tiner capsules naturally absorb onto my face to give my skins the shining and hydrated skin texture that everyone is yearning for. Furthermore, I love that this toner uses all natural botanical sprouts, lotus seed germ extract and 10 types of fresh herbs supply vitality into fatigued skins. As many Asian women prefers a whiter facial complexion, you often see them shun sunlight but staying indoors or wear huge straw hats to shield their faces from the sun. This toner also includes askin bightening ingredient that transforms skin clearer and more transparent with the refreshing power of lotus seeds and sprouts. FINALLY, this tonerNaturally replenishes moisture without any sticky sensation for the fresh finish and quickly absorbed, I typically shy away from toners that are too heavy, this toner is the perfect consistency to lay the foundation for my premium night creams and serums.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4fIf you enjoy this review please let me know \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d",
