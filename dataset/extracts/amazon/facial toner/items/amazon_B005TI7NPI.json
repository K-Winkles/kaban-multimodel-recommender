                "reviewText": "I started using Simple cleaning facial toner, as I was looking for something that was closer to all natural and paraban free. I've used several toners over the years, some leave a greasy feeling, others dry me out far to much, and albeit some break me out. The last one I was using from WholeFoods was suppose to be all natural, good, blah, blah, blah. However, I found it kept breaking me out and my skin was clean as I would of liked it.After alot of searching I found Simple. I tired the toner first and I love it. It works the way a toner should, and it doesn't dry me out or break me out. Those are huge pluses in my skin. Nor does it extra redness to my already fair pinkish skin. I've used this product for 2 months and I've added there exfoliating cleanser, and there daily cleanser to my routine. Simple is a really great brand, and I'm glad I found them because it works so well for me. My skin type is dry (dry t-zone too), very pale, and some pink/reddish cheeks. Almost anything I use is always to much my skin to oily, or to drying. This has been a perfect balance for me and highly recommend them. I bought this product at full price on here because I couldn't find it at my local target or walmart. I will continue to purchase this when I run out.",

It is a mild and pleasant feeling toner. It is alcohol free and made with 'simple' ingredients. Since I used the toner in a Korean style beauty routine, I poured a small amount of toner into clean hands and patted it over my face, neck and chest. By using my hands I save product that would otherwise be sucked up by cotton balls but either method works fine. The toner did not sting or dry out my face when applied. It offers a light moisturizing boost and drys on the face fairly quickly.I liked the Simple Facial Toner in Soothing formula due to its gentleness and effectiveness in maintaining ideal skin pH conditions for the products that followed behind. I personally will not repurchase because I feel I need a toner that provides a heavier douse of moister to the skin but I would recommend this to anyone with very sensitive skin.",

                "reviewText": "There are no ingredients I'm trying to avoid in the pleasingly brief list of what's used in this toner. I notice no scent at all when using the product, which is exactly what I prefer. Even using a gentle cleanser, my aging and sensitive skin needs calming after cleansing, and this does the trick. It balances the skin's Ph after washing and includes ingredients that help it retain moisture, but it's only one step in the process. You'll need a good moisturizer as well. This is my first experience with the Simple brand and it lived up to expectations. My skin was irritated and flaking from a different toner, and it took only a day or two to clear up after the switch.",

I haven't noticed any bad reactions and my skin just feels nice and clean after using it. I gave it 3 stars because my bottle arrived damaged- the top couldn't close all the way and I lost a significant amount of product since it leaked all over the bag. I was able to buy another container and switch the tops so that it closes now, but it was definitely annoying that I had to pay extra for a new container and had less product than I was expecting. I'll attach a photo soon.",
