But that's not all - they also contain Vit. C and Turmeric - two wonderful ingredients. Besides the Rose and Jasmine Water, on the ingredient list there is also Tranexamic Acid - which was a new name for me, so I looked it up and it's actually great for your skin (!). And there is Glycerin too, which is a known component of many skin products. So there you go - good, safe ingredients and lovely fragrance. Plus, it feels very refreshing on my skin.",

During shipment, it must have leaked. The bottles were both sticky and damp. I still really wanted to try the product... I tested it on my skin for 4 hrs and experienced no issues. However, the scent was just ok... diluted. Once you spray it, the smell is not that great, but once it settles, it actually smells a little better. Between the Jasmine and Rose, I prefer the Rose in overall scent, but I'm not really fond of either. I don't really like how it feels on my skin. It left a feeling of \"product\" on my skin. I was hoping for something that is more pure and clean. After a few minutes as it sets on my skin, that \"product\" feeling actually dissipates... the scent of Jasmine and Rose come through more clear. It sprays on clear. My feelings are very mixed. In all honesty, I'm not fond of either scent. I do like the simplicity of ingredients. I also wish it was packaged and shipped better amongst other things. For the current value for both bottles... it's fair. But then again, scent and value is all relative per each individual.",

Mine arrived leaking which is very annoying. However, I still have used both and like them a lot. I like to apply my foundation and then spray it gently before blending it into my skin and I get a nice result. I also like to spray my face during the day as a little pick-me-up. At night before bed I like to spray my face and arms so I smell extra good as I fall sleep. I have not experienced any negative skin reactions. It's a simple and inexpensive product.",

I tried cleaning one of the bottles, thinking that maybe they were packaged in a box where a bottle had leaked. Unfortunately, the label came off and the bottle still felt weird. There wasn't a seal on the bottles either, which is a huge turn off for me.Given all of that I still wanted to try the product. They both smell pretty good but I really wanted to use them on my face. I placed one drop of pure glycerin in my hand then sprayed the rose water scented spray on my hand. I rubbed my hands together then applied it to my face. It did not feel tacky or sticky and my skin actually felt quite good. I followed that up with my regular facial moisturizer. My skin was soft, supple and felt elastic. I think the glycerin had more to do with how my skin felt than the spray.Since I really like the scent of both sprays I will probably use these on my hair.",

I tried the rose water on my wrist and hair and have had no adverse reaction. My water sprays came packaged together in a bubble wrap bag, inside the shipping box, which was a very good thing as the bottles leaked through the bag and into the box. It didn't damage the other things in the box. I just rinsed the bottles off and they don't leak now when sitting upright. I plan to share these with my adult daughter who lives with me and enjoys trying something new sometimes. I really appreciate the short list of ingredients in these sprays, mostly organic water, vitamin C and turmeric.",

I was hoping to use these as a toner since that's in the description, but they don't rebalance the pH of my skin after washing (which is what a toner is supposed to do). If you want to spray water on your face for part of your routine, the scents are nice. The mist is kind of middle of the road, not super uneven, but not super fine either. One leaked a little in the packaging. I don't really think I would recommend these.",
