For anyone who has aging, dehydrated/sensitive skin, wears makeup and is interested in an all Aveeno routine, here is mine. Wash first with Aveeno shower oil to remove makeup, then Aveeno skin relief body wash for your face cleanse (it is a nice gentle surfactant), then the calm and restore oat serum for redness relief, then this toner (I pat it in and it pushes the serum in). I then pat on some oat oil to serve as a barrier to the differin, because of my sensitivity it prevents me from overdoing it. I put on differin, then pack on my night mask of the following: apply the soothing relief overnight cream, the cica balm to lips, under eye, around nostrils, and then dot a little baby ointment on all over to seal everything in to the fullest. In the morning I do a mask on my nose while I am having coffee; peel it off and put on the positively radiant lotion with sunscreen:",

I expect Amazon to deliver this item healthy. The product itself is highly recommended. The damage was caused to it as the result of the delivery.",
