                "reviewText": "Love it! I do not really use make up, only mascara and some cover up. But 90% if my time I wear none. I use moisturizer and night time face mask moisturizers. Thats it. I got this to close my pores, I use Biore daily deep pore cleansing clothes every morning and night and then right after (air dry face first) I use this then moisturizer and then make up if I use any. I have noticed alot less grease and oil on my face. I am a welder and get material on my face alot and this has helped keep my pores clean. When I weld I get REALLY hot and so my face gets hot from the temps and so my pores would open. This helps alot with that. I am also training to be a bus driver for some extra income right now and so I am up early and out late, and this has helped my skin stay consistently good. Not oily and not dry. I just started using this, I believe over a month ago but maybe longer, and have noticed these changes. I am unsure if other toners are better or worse, but for my first ever experience using this, I am overall pleased. I have quite fair skin that gets oily and dryness with chin and nose acne and I am happy with it. It does not make acne go away, it is not a face cleaner, it just helps the pores over time is what I understand.",

                "reviewText": "After I wash my face, I like to make sure every trace of dirt and makeup is gone. I used to use Clinique's toner for sensitive skin but it's pricey and didn't seem to pick up much residue. I have used Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner on and off for a long time. It is very gentle and great for dry or sensitive skin. It has a very light scent and doesn't strip my skin. It removes the last traces of dirt and makeup and leaves my skin in a neutral state, ready for my day or night serums and creams.I use a cotton round or square and gently wipe it across my face and neck. I generally see a little residue even though I have washed my face well. My skin doesn't sting or burn and it also isn't dried out like harsher toners do to it. While astringents like SeaBreeze are more powerful, they just aren't for dry, sensitive skin. I shun alcohol in beauty products if I can so this one fits right n with y preferences.It's cheaper than Clinique's toner and does a better job. I like it and think you will too . It doesn't remove a full face of makeup but it isn't made to. It's made to use after cleansing to tone the skin. It's also refreshing in the summer when I am hot and want to freshen up my face quickly. I have a bottle on hand pretty much all the time.",
