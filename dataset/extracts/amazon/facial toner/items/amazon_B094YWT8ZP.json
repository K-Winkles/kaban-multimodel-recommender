I do have sensitive skin so I just swiped it on my skin with a cotton swab left in on for a minute then I rinsed off my face with water then I followed up with moisturizer. I have really dry patchy skin and this morning all my dry patches were gone and I had no irritation at all. I'm sure after a while my skin will grow more tolerance to it. I did feel tingling sensation to this even though there are some calming ingredients in this toner so definitely use this carefully \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019m a PACU nurse and am very active at work. I sweat throughout my work day & while I still sweat there\u2019s no odor to it. I even workout after work and still don\u2019t smell even a hint of odor.",

                "reviewText": "Por el empaque no se si es un producto original ya que se ve\u00eda muy barato , pero puede que sea asi para no aumentar mucho el precio del producto . Huele como agua oxigenada y al menos en mi piel , arde , si tienes una herida peque\u00f1ita o un granito abierto ARDE. Aun asi lo use por dos semanas y no mejoro en nada mis manchitas en la piel , me atrevo a decir que incluso empeoro la textura de mi piel. Lo estoy usando en rodillas y codos solo para darle un uso y que se gaste , pero lo mismo , no veo mejoras.",
