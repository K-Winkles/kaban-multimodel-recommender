                "reviewText": "My profile: 49, Caucasian male. I've had not great skin my whole life. It's not that I have a ton of acne, it's just that I've had clogged pores and small blackheads with occasional blemishes (pimples, zits, etc.) for as long as I could remember. I have huge pores on my nose and they always seem to be filled with dirt or oil or some kind of gross crud. That's why I decided to start using some skin care products. I bought the 3 pack of serum from Amazon, have been using it for two straight months and here is my experience:Smell/Texture/Color: Yeah, this stuff isn't going to win any awards for how it looks. It's kind of a slimy, milky, gooey, watery looking clear-ish liquid. There is little to no scent, thank goodness.Application: A little bit goes a long way with this stuff. After I shower or wash my face, I use the Vitamin C serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid serum in the morning, then the Retinol serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid serum at night. It dries quickly and gets absorbed into the skin without much problem. If you put on too much, you will feel it kind of just sitting on the surface of the skin. If you have used too much, and you get some water on your face, it will feel a little slimy.Results for Blemishes, Pimples, Zits and Blackheads: I have definitely noticed a big decrease in the amount of blemishes that I've suffered. I used to have two or three \"normal\" sized blemishes a month. Now I have one or two per month, and they are much smaller.Results for pore size: I don't think that anything can really shrink the size of your pores, however, I have noticed that there is a big decrease in the amount of crud in my pores and they do look smaller, but because they are clean or have stayed clean or whatever wizardry these serums use. It has been noticeable.Bonus results for wrinkles: I didn't buy this stuff for wrinkles. I was more worried about blemishes and such, but WOW. Yes, it really does smooth out the wrinkles. It was noticeable after two weeks. They wrinkles were starting to fade. I understand that it's not a permanent thing. Once you stop with the serums, the wrinkles will eventually come back. I wasn't expecting such a dramatic wrinkle reduction and I've been pleasantly surprised.Reactions: I have had almost no reactions to the serums. I did get a little bit of dryness and tingling with the Retinol serum, but it went away after a couple of weeks.Overall: I'm very happy with this product. Follow their suggestions, don't overdo it and I honestly hope that you see the same results that I do.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I\u2019m 32 with and I\u2019ve battled acne and redness since about I was about 20. This year I cut dairy (my daily 16 oz Unsweet latte was half the problem) and I started working out much more frequently and eating lots of nutrients (veggies especially) and making my own daily drinking bone broth for the collagen support. STILL...my face showed some smile lines and I could see the beginnings of aging - like tiny lines around eyes, dull skin starting to lose its plumpness, and still a scattering of acne (way better, but still annoying). I did monthly facials and bought a very expensive line of vitamin c serums, moisturizers etc. one year later and I quit the products and the facials because I honestly couldn\u2019t see a difference.On a whim I ordered these serums.OMG! I have never had softer, clearer, smoother skin and I\u2019ve only been using them a week. I haven\u2019t even tried their other products yet (ordered them yesterday though!) my skin looks better this week than it has since my teens (oddly my skin issues waited till 20s to show up).I use the Retinol every other night, vitamin c every morning and the in between nights. Hyaluronic acid layered on top. For now I\u2019m just putting my Vintage Traditions tallow balm on top of the serums, but I\u2019m anxious to try their moisturizers.I can\u2019t emphasize enough how happy I am with this product!I will update this review in two months and let you all know if it\u2019s still as amazing as it seems one week in and if adding the other products made a difference.I know this review is long, but I struggled with skin for so long and I feel like I\u2019ve finally found the right combo of products and diet and stress management (gym/yoga) and I want to tell everyone who suffers from acne and/or skin issues!UPDATE: May 2019I've used these products for nearly three months. I am still very happy with them. I use the Vitamin C moisturizer and eye gel on top of the serums in the day and at night I use the Retinol cream. they are fantastic. I barely get acne anymore and when I do cheat and eat a bunch of dairy - these make my skin clear from the inevitable outbreak at least twice as fast. I think is the one of the best lines I have used on my skin. My skin is younger looking and much less red. I am very happy with these!!",

In terms of the way it feels on my skin, it kind of works like a moisturizer, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I needed from this product. The feeling is slightly sticky, but it leaves an oily residue. It doesn\u2019t feel that comfortable on my skin, and I wish it were a little more watery. Overall, it\u2019s not bad, but don\u2019t hesitate to give it a tru because this might work really well for others. It has brightened my skin by a little bit so I\u2019ll give it that.",

I bought this product in May and was delighted with how it worked. Absorbs quickly, leaves my skin smooth and soft, fresh-looking, and doesn't have any girly scent. A little goes a long way too. I was really disappointed when I wanted to buy it again and it was unavailable so was delighted to see it back in stock. But the price rise from \u00a315.99 to over \u00a340 since May is obsence. When I couldn't rebuy I found a similar product on Amazon for less than half the current price of this. As far I can see the ingredients are virtually identical, it takes a little longer to absorb but the results are the same as Tree of life serum.until the price returns to a sensible level I will use alternatives.",

                "reviewText": "I have not had a chance to use the Niacinamide Serum fully yet or to give an honest opinion borne from experience. I can do that in a couple of weeks if I am asked again. One thing, I wasn't sure why the container was a dropper bottle. Sorry that is probably a very dumb thing to say. Is it that you have to add drops to another solution mix the two together and apply it that way. I guess I was thinking you would be just putting it directly onto your face just like most creams in a pot. Is it because the Niacinamide liquid is fairly strong and can be mixed with your favourite cream which acts as a medium or is it that you can make a mixture with other Tree of Life Beauty products thus making your own personal blend and also that i would make the Niacinamide Serum milder just adding a few drops to another medium and make it last longer too. I read a very overheated review before I bought it saying the Serum had a strange smell like bread or pizza or something like that but I didn't notice anything like that at all. Anything that is meant to help balance oil production, reduce water loss in the skin, and lessen inflammation has got to be a good thing. I would like to give a proper review later and after I have obtained a modelling contract and done a few catwalk parades in front of fashionistas and the press. So watch this space; not all news is fake. So thankyou Tree of Life Beauty for this product and the free gift bonus which is Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1oz, a wonderfully generous offer. No other company is giving this much to it's customers. That has got to encourage customer loyalty. Very kind. I won't add any photos of myself until I have had the plastic surgery but after all these serums I might not need the surgery after all. All the best to you at Tree of Life Beauty.",
