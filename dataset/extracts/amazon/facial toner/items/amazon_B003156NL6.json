She says it smelled kinda funny in the beginning, almost like a fermented smell, but then got used to it and no longer feels that way about it. Didn't feel like it worked very well for acne on its own, although it works very well as a tandem for her with another treatment cream. You're not actually supposed to do that because it can cause dryness. But she uses a moisturizer too, and altogether it works very well for her for acne, and especially in making her skin color even out. She's very happy with this product.",

What that ALWAYS led to was a scar that, to me, looked worse than the zit itself. So, what this product does quite rapidly actually is get rid of current pimples AND faded my scars COMPLETELY even ones I still had that I was sure would always be visible.This doesn't burn or dry out my skin and since using it I can't even remember the last time I saw a single pimple on my face anywhere at all. Plus my skin looks brighter and fresher WITHOUT wearing makeup. I actually love wearing minimal makeup because at 40+ now, I love looking in the mirror and seeing skin that looks better than when I was in my 20's. Neutrogena never disappoints. I use this AND the Rapid Clear pads. And like I said, it's great for acne prone skin and does everything it promises on the bottle BUT even if you don't have really bad acne and want something good for scars or brighter, more youthful skin, totally give it a try. Did wonders for me! \ud83e\udd70",

                "reviewText": "This'll do it. My son is 13. This is the first time I've experienced any sensitive acne/pimples in my family so I'm new to this. I've been blessed with nice skin but I also take care of it. I tried to treat him naturally first. With mixtures of essential oils, Biore wash, exfoliating etc But he kept having issues. I persoally have an expensive heavy duty cream that I use for wrinkle prevention and is often prescribed for acne. I used it twice on my son and was amazed. But I didn't feel comfortable using it on him continuously...it was more of an experiment and then perhaps a trip to the dermatologist. Not needed. Once I saw how well THAT worked, I began researching online and found this golden bottle of magic. I would only recommend this if you have trouble spots, full blown acne or constant problem skin. We applied it all over his face with s cotton ball for three days only once a day. He only has a few problem areas around his upper face, lower cheeks, nose area etc. Also on his upper back (he had the biggest problem here). Be super careful to go light at first. It TOTALLY cleared up his face, but it also dried it out so much that he looked slightly sunburned and was actually itching a lot. I needed to rub coconut oil very lightly into his face to keep it moisturized. We are good to go now. If this happens to you, only use Raw Virgin Coconut oil on your face. It has lauric acid which is antibacterial and absorbs VERY well into the skin unlike other moisturizers which sit closer to the surface and block pores. Use the thinnest layer possible and massage it, in gentle circles, with your fingertips directly into your skin until absorbed. It should not appear greasy. Do not use coconut oil to treat acne alone! Leave your pores completely open with NO moisturizer after cleansing. Don't believe propaganda about needing moisturizers. If you have trouble skin, you DON'T NEED IT. (Wrinkle cream is a whole different story ladies!). Only use coconut oil on clear skin or skin that needs treatment (excessively dry, sunburned etc). Once we treated his now DRY skin with the oil, he is back to using this toner several times a week to keep it clear. But others may need to increase this amount. I'm super happy I found this. Remember to try all holistic options FIRST before applying synthetic, marketed products from stores. There are many holistic recipes on the internet. They've always worked for my skin. But they don't work for everyone. Why a 4-star review? Because I think they should communicate more precisely, the reaction you may have if your skin is sensitive. Simply use common sense and you've got this... Good luck - God speed!",
