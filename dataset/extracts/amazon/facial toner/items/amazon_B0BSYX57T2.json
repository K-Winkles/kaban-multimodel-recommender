I chose Bubble because the ingredients looked good and the set felt like it was just what she needed.This toner mist is great to use after cleansing or throughout the day for a refreshing boost to your skin. The bottle is really cute and the sprayer produces a lovely mist that's light and feels great on the skin. It doesn't feel sticky or tacky and absorbs well into the skin.My daughter has been using this along with their cleanser, serum, and moisturizer and has noticed a great improvement in her skin. She's had no adverse reactions and has been enjoying how easy it is to use each of the products in the line. This mist is her favorite because she doesn't care for using toners that come in bottles you have to pour from.The bottle is cute and fun and the product is of great quality. The price is a little high for how much you receive, but it is working great on my daughter's skin.",
