I do use the day cream, night cream and this toner and they're all great products. I hope they're working too because everyone says that I don't look my age. Not sure if Elemis should get all the credit but just sharing :) I have also taken Elemis facials in India and they were really top quality. I haven't found anything like that here in the States yet and if I do, will I be paying only 60 bucks? I'm not sure. I miss that quality and service at times.",
