This never stings and has a gentle, refreshing and hydrating feel. It has good dry skin ingredients, such as sodium hyaluronate, butylene glycol, beta glucan, panthenol and Laminaria Japonica Extract. I still use a serum after this toner, but some may be able to simply follow with a moisturizer.This has Aspergillus Ferment mold extract that\u2019s used for lightening and may help prevent hyperpigmentation over time. I\u2019ve used this toner about a dozen times so I can\u2019t yet judge if that\u2019s a helpful addition. This does have artificial colorants and fragrance. While I find the scent light and pleasant, the fragrance ingredients are potential irritants and rate moderate to high health risk by EWG. This also has citric acid and geranium maculatum oil, which may also be irritants. I do have sensitive skin, however, and haven\u2019t had any irritation. This toner feels refreshing and also adds hydration that makes my skin feel comfortable. Like it. 4 stars.
