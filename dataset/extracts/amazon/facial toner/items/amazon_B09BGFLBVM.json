This product has become a staple in my daily skincare routine, and I can't sing its praises enough.The infusion of Aloe and Coconut Water provides an incredibly refreshing and hydrating experience for my skin. The mist is fine and evenly distributed, creating a lightweight and non-greasy feel. It's perfect for setting my makeup, giving me a natural and dewy finish that lasts throughout the day.The subtle coconut scent is delightful and adds a touch of tropical luxury to my skincare routine. I appreciate that the formula is free from harsh chemicals, making it suitable for my sensitive skin. The addition of Aloe is a game-changer, providing a soothing sensation that is especially refreshing during hot or dry weather.I also love the versatility of this facial spray. Besides setting makeup, I use it as a midday pick-me-up to revitalize my skin or as a quick refreshment after a workout. The compact size makes it convenient to carry in my bag, ensuring that I have a burst of hydration whenever I need it.In summary, the Mario Badescu Setting Facial Spray Mist with Aloe & Coconut Water is a skincare gem. It's effective, smells amazing, and the benefits extend beyond just setting makeup. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hydrating and rejuvenating facial mist. Five stars, without a doubt! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

                "reviewText": "I usually avoid Mario Badescu products due to fragrance, fragrant oils or irritating ingredients. It's a pleasant surprise to find a fragrance and dye free formula with great, gentle, skin-friendly ingredients. The size is generous, and the price is pretty reasonable for the amount and quality.The sprayer mists pretty finely and it works well as a makeup setting spray (perhaps won't hold your makeup as well as some of the harsher ones, but makes makeup look \"softer\" and less \"powdery\" and skin look more natural). It doesn't leave your skin too sticky or shiny, but just a touch sticky but not enough to be an issue. If you get it near your eyes (don't spray it at your eyes) it doesn't burn or irritate if it gets close.It's soothing and lightly moisturizing. It works well over makeup and under skincare and makeup (let it dry first). It probably won't be the only and sole moisturizer for most people, except with very oily skin. You'll likely want to add a layer of moisture at some point in your day or night (I suggest Cerave PM, Vanicream face moisturizer, the one for the face or The Oridinary's facial moisturizer in the tube.) but this is great to add moisture under thicker creams.I've used it as a makeup finishing-setting spray, makeup refresher and skin refresher. My favorite use is sprayed into my hands (you waste less than misting it) and applying from my hands as a toner. I rotate it with Cerave's toner (don't use both together) or one from Peach Slices or Good Molecules.Physician's formula now makes a much smaller spray (fragrance free) that's smaller and more expensive per oz than this that I also like. But there is no other spray that I've found that is a better value than this or as gentle on the ingredients and doesn't burn or sting. I may mix it up but it's always going to be a favorite.It said it could be used on hair. I did not like it at all on my hair. Some people might but I found it way too sticky for my hair. My hair is fine, coarse, wavy and dry (weird hair). And it made my hair look a little stringy and feel sticky. I tried it sprayed on my hair and another time sprayed into the palm of my hand and worked into my hair and I disliked it in my hair both times.It does have the tiniest bit of odor, not fragrance or scent, from the ingredients but it's not strong and it goes away quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I initially wasn\u2019t expecting much because I got the 4oz in Christmas gift set from a guy friend that knows nothing about skin care. After using it, it quickly became a staple in my routine. It is sooo refreshing and has many uses. Some people use it before make up, some use it as a setting spray. I mostly use it after I\u2019ve washed my face and put on moisturizer. It gives that extra feeling of hydration, with a slight cooling and tightening effect (I live in FL). The scent is light and not overwhelming at all. After I ran out of the little one I had to buy the 8oz because it\u2019s that great.",

                "reviewText": "I love Mario Badescu hydrating mists. Portable, but generous amounts. Very hydrating. Affordable. I have them in my bag, my office, nightstand, the fridge (yes, the fridge), and bathroom. I'm all about skin care (I'm 64), not makeup. I use this to prep for gua sha, then oil for \"slip,\" so the stone works the moisture into my skin. I always add about 10 drops of rosehip seed oil into my bottles for extra smooth skin and use it often during the day and before bed. These mists are never drying. Oh, and I never rub mists (or any product) on my skin. Smooth it over skin, then gently press it into the skin. That way it also won't mix with other products or smear makeup. Love, love these hydrating mists. A tip for summer: Keep a bottle of the cucumber and green tea mist in the fridge and another with you. When you get home, put the travel mist into the fridge and use the one from the fridge. Excellent for hot weather--and for hot flashes!",
