I was happy to stumble upon this toner it is THE ONLY product my skin will tolerate right now. I don\u2019t use creams or cleansers (unless I wear makeup that day) I just swipe my face with this twice a day and go. It moisturizes and balances my skin and since using it my face has been bright & hormonal bumps have been under control. I\u2019m satisfied. Curious about other products in the line but my pregnancy skin seems to think less is best so I\u2019ll probably just stick to this toner.",

All I can say is Mid. I don't think there would be a difference between putting water on my face and this toner. Made my under eyes burn a little. I would only recommend this to someone who wants very basic skincare or wants to mix the toner with another product.",

This toner is scent free, and the consistency of water. I apply it to clean skin with my finger tips, I pat it into my face. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft. It's very gentle and causes me no irritation. It is not greasy or sticky at all, and it pairs beautifully with lotions, sunscreen, and makeup.My skin loves this toner. It feels noticeably softer, and it's plump and moisturized even though the winter air is dry as can be. My skin is looking a bit brighter overall, and with less texture. I usually fight with jawline acne, and I'm actually finding that it is diminishing now that I'm using this toner regularly. The toner feels instantly cooling and soothing on my skin, which makes using it a very pleasant experience. Full marks from me!",
