I added it in for almost a week now and have been gladly surprised with the results. My skin has felt more supple, tighter and brightened. My skin feels slightly more healthy and not as dried out. Definitely was worth adding in to my daily routine - although I only use it at night.I would definitely recommend this Vitamin C toner.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used toners on and off for years. As a teenager, I had really oily skin. Now as a senior, the only oily spot I have is that T shaped zone; my forehead and my nose. So I use toner less.I have noticed enlarged pores in this area, so I started using an older toner I had on hand and it seemed quite harsh (alcohol in it). So, I gave this one a shot.FOR A PRODUCT WITH VITAMIN C IT HAS ALMOST NO SCENTYears ago, the Body shop had some products that had Vitamin C in them that I really liked. Honestly I think it was the scent that attracted me. That plays a big part. Especially something you are putting so close to your nose. That was a disappointment for me with this product. It almost has no scent. I was hoping for a fresh citrus scent.SEEMS TO WORKWhen I have used this product, it has cleaned my skin of oils. I see the results on a cotton pad. So I can\u2019t complain there. But if I compared it to Witch Hazel alone would it be much different?I have used this product, like I would any toner. On a cotton pad, wiped on. I have not noticed any film, or stickiness.Looking around for prices on just Witch Hazel, I can get it for $4 for 16 oz at Target.This product cost $18.99 for 3.38 oz.This price is 22X higher than just Witch Hazel alone. Wow.Comparing this product to plain Witch Hazel it would have to be remarkably different for me to keep using. I have used it but not every day/night. And being a toner, I guess I don\u2019t think of using it on other than oily spots.. I plan to use it a bit more to see if it is better than just Witch Hazel.INGREDIENTS:**** AQUA,**** GLYCERIN,**** PROPANEDIOL,**** HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) EXTRACT,**** NIACINAMIDE,**** 3-O-ETHYL ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C),**** GLYCERETH-26,**** ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT,**** PHENOXYETHANOL,**** CITRUS LIMON FRUIT EXTRACT,**** VITIS VINIFERA FRUIT EXTRACT,**** SODIUM HYALURONATE (HYALURONIC ACID),**** ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN,**** SODIUM POLYACRYLATE.This was the ingredient list on Amazon and on the box it came in. I have to give them credit, there are no parabens.Looking at the top 5 ingredients: I looked these up for their uses on your skin (topical):Aqua is water. However, they call it that: In Latin, water is called \"aqua\". So if you're using INCI to label your products, you use \"aqua\" on your product labels. I learned something today.Glycerin is a humectant, a type of moisturizing agent that pulls water into the outer layer of your skin from deeper levels of your skin and the air. In skin care products, glycerin is commonly used with occlusives, another type of moisturizing agent, to trap the moisture that it draws into the skinPropanediol: In cosmetics and personal care products, propanediol functions as an emollient, humectant, and solvent. As an emollient, propanediol has the ability to soften and soothe the skin. Upon application, propanediol forms an occlusive film on the surface of skin that aids in preventing water loss.Witch hazel is an astringent. It shrinks swollen tissue and provides relief from itching and irritation. Glycerin and witch hazel topical (for the skin) is a combination medicine used to relieve rectal pain, pressure, irritation, and mild bleeding caused by hemorrhoids. I found this interesting as I have heard of people using Preparation H to hide lines near their eyes. Hmm. Clearly this toner has both Witch Hazel and Glycerin.Niacinamide Applied topically, \"Niacinamide can improve skin texture and strengthen the protective barrier function of the skin, which then helps to reduce inflammation \u2014 often appearing as dry, irritated or flaky skin. It does so by increasing natural lipids found on the skin surface and reducing water loss.Based on what I see and have used. This is a decent enough product, that if used can improve your skin quality. However to the degree that it does,in comparison to plain witch hazel that is much less expensive, remains to be seen.Also in its favor, looking around at other toners, most either have Alcohol, or Salicylic Acid, neither of which I want to use. So the combination of Glycerin, Propandiol, Witch Hazel and Niacinamide appear unique and may be potentially effective. I will continue to use this and if I note anything particularly great, I will update this review.",

                "reviewText": "When I think of toners I usually think of something harsh and astringent and this is not like that at all. I have extremely sensitive skin and started off testing this very carefully out of concern that one of these ingredients could irritate my skin. Fortunately none did and I can use all over my face. There is no burning at all and also there is no sticky residue feeling that you sometimes get with vitamin C products. I don't see a big difference but I'm not sure I would with my skin type. My mom did comment that my skin looked great when I last saw her a few days ago so maybe there is an impacr. I don't feel like this is something that is deep cleaning my skin though if you are looking for that kind of toner.",

It contains not only Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, both of which are well establish as moisturizers and anti-oxidants. It also contains Witch Hazel, which I keep in my medicine cabinet. This is the first face serum that I have found that contains Witch Hazel, which can remove face oil. The ingredients also include Aloe, Lemon, and Grape Seed. The liquid is easy to apply and feels good. Altogether, I am very pleased with this face toner.",

                "reviewText": "The top dermatologists who I follow on social media all insist that the big guns for skin care are retinoids, vitamin C, and sunscreen. vitamin C is a newer addition for me, and I've been using a serum nightly. It actually does work to brighten the complexion, although it took a few months to work on my face. I usually use a glycolic acid toner, but wanted to give this vitamin C toner a try.It is a clear liquid that comes in a pretty translucent amber bottle. It's kind of thick, though, and not what I was expecting from a toner. My glycolic toner leaves my skin smooth and firm, while this just left it somewhat tacky. I tend to have oily skin, so the greasiness wasn't appreciated. Might work better on someone with dry skin. So I can't use this as a toner in the morning, and at night I use a vitamin C serum, so I don't really need it then, either. Not for me.",

                "reviewText": "I stopped using this product after just a couple of days. First, the way it comes out of the bottle makes it difficult to use without using too much or struggling to get the \"right\" amount. I tried putting this on a cotton pad and it absorbed right into the pad and really didn't work well on the face.When I put it on my fingers and rubbed it into my face, I became instantly oily. I have mixed skin (dry and oily depending on the day) and I wasn't overly surprised. I thought maybe I had just applied too much. I took a day off from it and then tried it again with a much smaller amount. After spilling a lot because of the force coming from the bottle, I washed my hands and tried again. The results were disappointing. Oily skin and really no point to this product for my use.",
