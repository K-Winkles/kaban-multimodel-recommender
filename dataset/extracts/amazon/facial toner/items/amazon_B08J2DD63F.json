The addition of cucumber, aloe vera, and hyaluronic acid nicely seem to cancel out the harsh qualities of the glycolic acid. It leaves my skin feeling firmer and cleaner practically immediately and I noticed a slight shrinkage in my pores' visibility. I'm not a huge fan of the chemical smell it has but, hey, it IS a bunch of chemicals. I would do a small patch test on those with sensitive skin as this is a rough though highly effective low grade chemical peel essentially. Love this product and would definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "When I started using this stuff, I was only using it once a week, (thanks, beauty YouTubers) worried that it would dry me out or irritate me. After a couple of months, I felt like it wasn't making any difference to my skin. However, I tested using it every other night and had no issues, no irritation or redness and my skin felt smoother. Now I use it every single night before my Tretinoin and I've never had irritation. My skin looks smoother, feels softer, and has that \"glass skin\" shine. I would say, try it one night and gauge your skins reaction. If you don't see or feel any irritation, try it every other night. If irritation occurs, you can always back off to once a week again. This stuff has other calming, soothing ingredients and the percentage of glycolic acid is low enough that unless you have super super sensitive skin or open wounds, I think you'll be fine using it.",
