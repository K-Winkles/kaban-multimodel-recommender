                "reviewText": "So let me start off by saying I purchased this item in hopes I'd find a cheaper alternative to a product called Alpha-h liquid gold that I received in an Ipsy bag. I loved the Alpha-h glycolic acid liquid gold so much but it's not in my budget. I believe the same sized bottle as this product would cost at least 40 dollars. Let's be in honest, for a lot of us in today's economy that's a lot! So off to Amazon I went in hopes of an alternative. I have found it in this product. This isn't meant to be used as an every day toner. I use it one to two times a week. It doesn't sting or make my skin red. I do feel a very faint heat that clears within 1 minute. You should have a good moisturizer to use as well. It helps keep my skin clear and helps me get rid of blemishes also. It's not a miracle liquid, as my hormonal acne will still pop up often enough but it really has helped reduce scars and discoloration. It gives my face a more even and clear look. I love it, especially for the price and as a replacement for the more expensive liquid gold product. I believe it works just as well. Just don't overuse it and keep yourself moisturized. :) I will definitely be a repeat customer. :)",

It is recommended to use this to get rid of the bacteria that makes a person smell, such as your underarms. If you are a woman, you know that the heat or working out creates smells that can make an individual feel uncomfortable. I used this under my breasts and between my thighs and let me say, it stops that smell. No it doesn't stop the sweat, but it gets rid of the bacteria that causes the smells. I have sensitive skin and this has not bothered it or created an issue for me. I feel better when I go to the gym or am outside in ridiculous heat. (Yes, I've used it outside of and around the lady bits and was still okay.) I recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Decided to give this a try since Ordinary raised their prices and since this is 10% I figured it should be a good swap. I\u2019ve been using glycolic acid in lieu of deodorant for years and it works beautifully. Zero odor. This works even better than the ordinary and I feel like it actually keeps me from sweating as much but i\u2019m not sure how that works. I\u2019ll definitely keep using this.",

I didn't look at the size before I bought it and was so surprised at how small it is compared to the Ordinary. But it does work better. I'm conflicted about whether to keep using it- I wish it were just a little more cost effective, AND I wish it came in more eco friendly packaging. I feel bad wasting a new plastic bottle every few months.",
