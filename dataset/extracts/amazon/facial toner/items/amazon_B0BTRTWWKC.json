Yuck. Yes, personal experience. This one has no scent, so it is great for whatever your needs are. Witch Hazel has a numbing effect, so if you have a sore throat, it's wonderful to gargle - don't swallow it as it has some unsavory side effects if you do. I use this to clean make-up off my eyes and face, too.",
