I\u2019ve been using it about 2 months now and I\u2019ve seen a bit of improvement in my skin tone. My bottle of the serum is now finish and I\u2019ll be purchasing more. It let my skin glows and even my skin tone that\u2019s what works for me. A little also goes a long way. It\u2019s not harsh on the face or anything it just feels like water on your skin and I love that. Highly recommend, even if you have sensitive skin.",
