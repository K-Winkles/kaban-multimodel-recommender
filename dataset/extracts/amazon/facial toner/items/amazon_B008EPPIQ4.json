Before this I was using a product called blackhead power liquid and that worked pretty good. It kept my pores looking small. However I always had redness. I have a few hairs I have to tweeze above my lip pretty much everyday (hormonal stuff) and no matter how many hours pass it's always kind of red and there's always hyperpigmentation where I plucked. Well to my delight, Paula's choice toner takes care of the hyperpigmentation. I'll never go back. It's been amazing having smaller pores AND not having to deal with hyperpigmentation.",

                "reviewText": "Here is a picture of what I use for my face which is both oily and dry. It has been hard finding the right face products for my skin. A lot of times it would clog my large pores, or I would have white heads along with dry/ red blotchy skin. Then I researched some of Paula\u2019s Choice products. I picked out what I thought fit my type of skin. After some adjusting my skin has been the best it has ever been. I don\u2019t have big blackheads, white heads, dry skin, or red blotches. And it feels great. In the morning I use the face wash, eye cream, and the daily hydrating fluid lotion. At night I use the face wash, the toner (make sure you let your face completely dry afterwards before moving on), I use 3 drops of the boost (let that dry), then I put on the night oil free moisturizer.Every Tuesday night I use the exfoliate instead of the toner. You let it dry completely. It takes about 15 minutes. I usually don\u2019t put anything on after using the exfoliate because I am too tired to wait for it to dry. It works for me.Then about once a month or every two weeks on a Friday night, after using the toner, I use exfoliate rinse off treatment. Afterwards I finish with the boost and night moisturizer.I highly recommend this brand.",
