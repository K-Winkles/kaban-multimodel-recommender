                "reviewText": "For many years, I have been really particular about facial cleansers and toners and consistently use them to keep my skin as healthy as possible.I have tried several different products in the past and a lot of times use different combinations of brands for different purposes.When I came across this set, the ingredients definitely were ones that I look for in facial products so I went ahead and place an order for it.I received them a few weeks ago and since using them, I am really seeing a nice difference.As far as the facial cleanser, it goes on a little bit thick, but a little goes a long way, and it gives my face a really nice fresh clean feeling after using it.The scent is not over bearing and definitely could be better, but it\u2019s not terrible.It is not abrasive at all so even if your skin is a bit sensitive, it should not bother it at all. Mine tends to be sensitive and it has been holding up nicely.As far as the toner, it also has quality ingredients but I\u2019m not 100% thrilled with it.The smell is really harsh, especially for the first several hours that it\u2019s on.It also feels very sticky to me.It smells and feels like when you put on an artificial self tanner.But, when I clean my face after using it, I do see a slight bit of discoloration on the cotton, which tells me that it is definitely helping getting rid of dry skin.Overall, I am very pleased with this set and will continue to use it. I would definitely recommend it, and I think for the price it is a good value. I have definitely spend a lot more money than this to get similar results, so I\u2019m very pleased with it.I hope my review helps you to make a more well informed decision.",

                "reviewText": "These are very substantial bottles of cleanser and toner that should last a long time. They came shrink wrapped together which assured me they hadn't been tampered with but otherwise did not have further tamper seals on the bottle. I notice about half my beauty products have seals and half do not, and it doesn't bother me one way or another. I used the cleanser in the shower and a small amount gave me a nice creamy wash all over my face. I used it on my closed eyes because allergies make me really want to wash my eyelids and I didn't experience any issues or stinging. It washed off easily. I only use toner sporadically - usually at night in place of a cleanser (lazy, I know, but I don't wear makeup, so it's fine) or mid-day if I get sweaty. Today I was working in the yard and so I used the toner to take the sweat off. It was pleasantly cooling, didn't sting, and didn't tighten my skin up or dry it out. The cotton ball did come away a bit dirty so I guess I was working hard. This is a good set and I will enjoy using them.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for INFINA ESSENTIALS Face Cleanser and Facial Toner, this cleaning duo is made for the convenience of using 2 most used beauty products in any skincare routine: cleanser and toner. What I like is that the cleanser is suitable for all skin types even sensitive skin. However, it is a little on the dry side. So I wouldn't recommend this for dry skin. It contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid and natural extracts, which could be the reason why it really drys out your skin. Usually I use salicylic acid cleansers because my skin is acne prone and oily. So this cleanser works good for my skin. I just make sure that I moisturize afterwards. The toner is also packed with glycolic acid, salicylic acid and HA, making this suitable and effective for all skin types except dry skin in my opinion. Overall this is a decent cleansing duo for your everyday facial cleansing.",
