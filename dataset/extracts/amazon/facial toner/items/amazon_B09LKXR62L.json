                "reviewText": "So, here's the deal\u2014I thought CeraVe Hydrating Toner was going to be the love story of my skincare routine. Spoiler alert: It turned into a horror flick.Applying this stuff was like putting honey on my face but without the sweet aroma. More like the kind of honey that attracts ants and regret. My face felt so sticky; I started wondering if it was secretly auditioning for a role in a low-budget horror film\u2014'The Human Fly Trap.'And let's talk about the drying sensation. Ever touched a glue stick and thought, \"Hmm, I wish this could be my facial experience\"? No? Well, congratulations, you've just described CeraVe Hydrating Toner. My face felt like the aftermath of a glue stick explosion at a failed DIY art class.In conclusion, if you're into skincare that makes you feel like a failed science experiment, CeraVe Hydrating Toner might be your soulmate. But if you prefer products that treat your face with a bit more respect and less stickiness, maybe swipe left on this one. It's not hydrating; it's a skincare trick played by the universe.",
