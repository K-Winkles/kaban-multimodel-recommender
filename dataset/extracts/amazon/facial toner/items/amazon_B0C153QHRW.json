If you use too much, you may notice an oily feeling.What I liked about it: A little bit goes a long way.What I didn't like: It can be a bit heavy if you're someone with oily skin.Overall, the wife recommends this face moisturizer if you have combo to dry skin.

                "reviewText": "I'm thrilled to share my experience with the BIONES Ultimate Repair Toner, and I'm pleased to give it a well-deserved 5 out of 5 rating. As someone with fairly oily and sensitive skin, I've been on the lookout for a toner that suits my skin type and concerns, and this product has truly impressed me.Before using this toner, I typically relied on witch hazel for my skincare routine. However, since I started using the BIONES Ultimate Repair Toner over a week ago, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in the appearance and feel of my skin. My face feels significantly more moisturized, and the overall texture has improved. It's as if my skin has regained a more youthful and vibrant look.One of the standout features of this toner is its efficiency. A small amount on a cotton pad goes a long way in covering my entire face, making it an economical choice. Unlike some toners that are overly thin and watery, this toner has a slightly thicker consistency, which I find pleasant. It doesn't have the harsh feel of alcohol on the skin; instead, it provides a refreshing and clean sensation.Another significant benefit of this toner is its suitability for sensitive skin. I appreciate that it doesn't irritate my skin and, instead, works gently to address concerns like acne, excess sebum, and oiliness. This toner has become an essential part of my daily skincare routine, and I can confidently say that it has made a positive difference.",
