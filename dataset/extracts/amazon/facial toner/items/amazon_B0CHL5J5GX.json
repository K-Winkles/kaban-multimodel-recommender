I was hesitant because I have dry skin and toner is known to be a better choice for oily skin, not dry. However, the listing says it's good for all skin types and contains moisturizing aloe vera. I've tried it twice and both times, even after applying lotion, my skin has felt dry and uncomfortable. There was a burning sensation during application, but it did not last or leave my skin red. This is a large bottle of toner, but I did not like the container it came in. It literally poured out the spout and a cotton ball is recommended and needed. I think a regular bottle cap would be a better choice.",

I have been using toner and I decided to try this one because I feel that Vitamin C products do help to brighten my complexion.This toner is a clear liquid in a large, simple plastic bottle with a flip top, so I apply the product using a cotton pad. I would describe the sensation as \"tingly,\" short of a burning sensation, that leaves my skin feeling ultra clean. It really removes makeup and any oils, and the astringent properties seem to close the pores after cleansing. Although it works fine for my mature skin, if I had a teen granddaughter I would definitely recommend it for her.I love that this product is made in the USA without parabens. It feels like it might help to brighten my complexion and it definitely leaves my skin feeling clean and tight.",

                "reviewText": "This toner is a watery liquid with no strong odor/ fragrance. I do feel the mild tingling sensations after use in the morning. I use it in conjunction with other Vitamin C lotions to amp up the brightening benefits. Not too drying, no adverse reactions. But it\u2019d likely be more welcoming to people with oily skins or for use in summers. While I enjoy toners and essences, I may not use this vitamin C toner on a daily basis due to its astringent-like quality. I also dislike its dispensing mechanism via a flip top cap. Typically toners use a dropper type top or a spray.This may be a good introductory option for those who want to start a less intense vitamin C regimen. Made in USA.",

                "reviewText": "I have combination skin which often looks dull and has uneven tone, making me search for a product that can brighten, balance, and refresh my skin. I decided to try the Vitamin C Toner, which seemed like the perfect candidate.The product comes in simple and sleek packaging, with a convenient spray nozzle and cap. The clear toner has no fragrance, which is what I prefer. Applying it is easy, I just have to spray it on a cotton pad or directly on my face after cleansing. The toner gives a gentle and soothing feeling without causing dryness or stinging. Its impressive ingredient list, including natural sources of vitamin C, makes me feel confident that it's suitable for my daily skincare routine.After using the toner for a few weeks, I noticed positive changes in my skin. My complexion looks more radiant and even, and my skin feels softer and smoother. The toner helps keep my skin hydrated and nourished, without causing any irritation or breakouts. Although I cannot comment on the long-term effects due to my short period of use, my overall experience has been exceptionally positive.",

                "reviewText": "Thankfully this came with a sealed bottle because the exterior box was beat up and open upon arrival. I have a vitamin C serum but don't use it much since it is a bit heavy and sometimes breaks me out. This being a toner feels much lighter and it's easy to add it to my routine without replacing anything in my current routine. It doesn't have any scents and is similar to my vitamin C serum, except lighter, which I appreciate. It is very watery and drips down the sides of the bottle when I directly squeeze some into my palms due to the design of the bottle dispenser. The product does suggest using a cotton pad which would solve this issue, but I do not like applying my toners with cotton pads since it wastes product and introduces unnecessary waste.It does mention it's good for 12 Months after opening, but I'm not sure how stable this product is since vitamin c is supposedly pretty unstable and lose efficacy quickly, so I plan to use this daily unless I have breakouts going on and need a bare routine.",

                "reviewText": "I love this product. Has a nice clean barely there citrusy scent. Not to confuse things as it does say fragrance free but that just implies they haven't added any fragrance. But I love the smell as when I first opened it I detected a light pleasant citrusy smell. Then I read the ingredients and there is a citrus uranium dulcet fruit extract as well as lemon fruit extract. And I smell it and it is lovely but barely there. So if you have an issues with scents this won't bother you as most reviewers say it has no scent. And it feels very good on my skin and makes my skin feel very good too. My skin tends by days end to be a bit oily so this is quite refreshing, feels good and cleans my skin leaving it feeling great. The bottle itself with the cap has some issues. I find opening and holding it right to the cotton pad gives you a bit without it getting messy because when I held it aloft and used it I found it running everywhere. So far everything to love and aside from being careful to get it all on the cotton pad everything about this product is good!",

It's too soon to notice any major positive results, however, I think there's a spot on my face that has faded a little after using this product. That's a good thing.
