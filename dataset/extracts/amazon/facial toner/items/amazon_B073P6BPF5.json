My skin usually turns red and look inflamed when I use certain face creams or moisturizer, even though its not painful or anything. But I realize that when i had this toner first (sprayed and patted it on my face) my face no longer become inflamed when i put on face cream/moisturizer. Yeay!",

My cheeks broke out really bad. I discontinued use and the bumps went away almost immediately. I used the toner again several days later and my face broke out within hours. Even using quality serums and moisturizers, my skin could not tolerate this toner.",
