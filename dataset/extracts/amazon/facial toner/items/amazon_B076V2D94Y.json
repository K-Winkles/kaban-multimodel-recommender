Haven't bought their toner for quite a while as I've had the same success with witch hazel astringent, and you get a whole lot more for slightly cheaper. Decided to give the toner a 'go' again as I was almost out of astringent. Still haven't used it yet, but I'm assuming I would not be disappointed. My only grouse is the toner does not come boxed or sealed. How do I know that what's in there, is what's supposed to be in there. Their moisturizer which is the only brand I use, period, comes boxed and there's no way anyone can get anything through the small dispensing hole, so it's a fairly secure buy. But the toner... I think I'll just go back to my regular astringent after. I can't trust that the toner is all toner and nothing else. Especially if it's an item returned by someone else, I'd never know if it was 'untouched'",
