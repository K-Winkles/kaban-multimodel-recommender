                "reviewText": "I have combination skin that can get extremely oily thanks to my skin overproducing oil to try to fix the dehydration. But I also get extreme dry patches, especially in winter but also in summertime too. Unfortunately I'm also very acne prone, so I have to use salicylic acid cleansers to deal with that which makes the dehydration worse. My skin is also quite sensitive. I've tried different moisturizers, but I have to use oil-free moisturizers thanks to my acne, and none of the ones I tried were occlusive enough to cure my dry spots.So I thought \"maybe a toner will help\" since that should be lightweight enough for my skin. I was really skeptical that just adding a toner would fix the problem, but I did my research. I found out that Korean beauty products are some of the best for sensitive, dry skin, and then I found out about Tony Moly toners on a forum. I was so surprised at how much of a value this was, even tho it's more money to spend up front.I couldn't be happier!! My skin is so soft and this doesn't break me out. It has a light, natural citrusy smell, but it doesn't irritate my skin at all. My dry patches are COMPLETELY gone, and my skin isn't overly oily anymore since it's no longer dehydrated. I currently only use one layer of this at night since it's summer and I don't need a lot of extra help right now. But I'm sure a couple of layers morning and night - paired with extra moisturizer - will work just fine in winter!Please do yourself a favor and try this!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars HYDRATING Toner",
                "reviewText": "HYDRATION is key! I bought this toner because I felt that I had a damaged skin barrier and wanted to restore my skin. I have oily dehydrated skin at the moment, and no amount of moisturizer will keep my oils at bay. I was looking for a hydrating toner that contained Ceramides or Panthenol. This toner not only checked those boxes but also contains Hyaluronic acid (hydration) and Centella Asiatica (soothing effect)! I also like how the ingredient list is not excessively long compared to other formulas.I have some rosacea spots on my skin and this toner did not sting my cheeks at all, but left my skin plump and hydrated! When I moved my facial muscles, I used to feel a tightness in my skin despite my skin being oily. After using this toner, I no longer feel the tightness in my skin and see less oil production. (I've also been using Krave Beauty products with this, just FYI.) I use the toner in the AM and PM and put 3-4 layers of the toner each time to rescue my skin barrier.Knowing TonyMoly's brand for a few years now, its cute packaging made me skeptical that this toner would do \"wonders\". Yet lo and behold, I can see this toner being a staple for a while. I live in a desert area near the beach, and this toner has provided me with great hydration. I also see this toner being effective in the winter months when my skin gets even drier. Also, the price point for 500 mL is such a great steal in my opinion!There is a slight scent, but I really enjoy the fresh, citrus/lemon scent and the smell dissipates quickly. I usually avoid heavily fragranced products, but I had no problems with the scent of this toner. The toner is milky and viscous, but the formula is runny like a liquid and adds to the hydration component this toner offers. Since I currently apply 3-4 layers of this toner at a time due to my damaged skin barrier, I can't say that this toner will sink into your skin immediately after one layer. However, it has helped all my other skincare products absorb better.When I initially bought it off Amazon, I was skeptical that this toner was not really from TonyMoly. Being the excessive person that I am, I bought this same toner from the official TonyMoly USA site and it's the same packaging as the Amazon one. (Too lazy to post pictures). Take it or leave it, this product is authentic folks!9/10 recommend this toner if you are looking for hydration with some great ingredients and affordable price point! I think I love the fact that I happened to stumble upon this toner and was surprised by how great it is. I like it so much I secretly don't want other people to know about it.",
