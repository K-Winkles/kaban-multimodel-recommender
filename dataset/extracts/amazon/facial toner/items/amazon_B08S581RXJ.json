I\u2019m at a magical place where nothing is what is was and my skin has joined in the games! I heard about PHA and started this product 3 weeks ago and am thrilled with my skin, it somehow clarifies without stripping and i know Technically pores don\u2019t \u201cshrink\u201d but my pores sure look like they have shrunk! This product somehow moisturizes yet also gently exfoliates which leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy and the blackheads are gone!!! (I tried taking a picture but my iPhone makes my skin look airbrushed and I\u2019m not trying to create fake images!)Using 2x/day and the bottle is about 1/3 the way gone so i assume about a 2 month supply but I\u2019ve Already purchased additional bottle to ensure I\u2019ve got backup should any shortage or shipping delay arise ;)",

I came across this skin care line and was instantly intrigued by the price and the meaning behind the products. I was skeptical about it working as good because it was significantly cheaper. But I was not let down. My face is still glowing even after making the switch to this product. I\u2019ve always had very oily skin during the warm months and this has calmed it down completely. My face feels hydrated but not oily. When I received the items I was blown away by the packaging. So professional and well put together. I will continue to buy from this brand as long as the price point stays the same.",

No fragrance, no oils, no bull. The toner dries down smooth and feels nice under serums, moisturizer and sunscreen.I wanted to use it for a month before reviewing and the results are impressive. My skin is more even and looks healthy which is rare while on chemo. I'm looking forward to trying many more of their products in the very near future.",

It does not irritate my skin, and in fact, helps lock in moisture. I don\u2019t know of any other toner with polyhydroxy acid that actually works for under $8. Minimalist is a wonderful brand available at low prices. I\u2019ve always been happy with their products.",
