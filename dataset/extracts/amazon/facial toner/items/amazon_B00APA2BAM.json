                "reviewText": "Something burns my skin... (Lavender? Lavender is a skin irritant, despite what anybody says.) It stings my cheeks and under my eyes. At first, the reaction wasn't that noticeable, and I considered that it might be from the retinol lotion I also use. Over the last few weeks the burning has worsened to the point of visible redness. Whether it's from the toner alone or reacting with the retinol, I'm not sure, but it's a no-go. My skin has spoken! However, and strangely, my neck and forehead is a-okay with the stuff. (FYI I also use retinol there.) I'm kind of at a loss...I can't recommend this toner, or out and out reject it, either. I just have a strong suspicion that one or all of the fragrant oils is at fault, because the rest of the ingredients list is up to snuff. Certainly avoid this if you know you're sensitive to rose and lavender oils. I think if BWC took these out this toner would be a beauty steal! Glycerin, aloe barbadensis, cucumber, green tea, allantoin, panthenol, and vitamin E are skincare stars. It would be nice if a sample size were available to test for sensitivity. I love supporting this brand.Also, the bottle is made out of the best and safest kind of plastic - #2 HDPE. This shows that genuine thought went into the packaging and I love that. I'll be reusing the bottle for other product.",
