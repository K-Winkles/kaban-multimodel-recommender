                "reviewText": "I had to get more of this spray after I used my first bottle. Sometimes I go work out after a long day at work, and I was having trouble with breakouts because of that. This spray has been the perfect solution to my problem and I spray it on my face throughout the day. It's been a huge help!Personally, I've found it works best for me if I use it separate from my morning and night routine to keep my face feeling fresh throughout the day and right before bed. Some other people mention to use it like toner but I didn't feel I was getting the best results for my skin that way, so it's worth testing to see where and how will be best to use it in your routine.I was also nervous when I got the packaging since it looked different from the last time I received it, so I reached out to the manufacturer to verify that it was their product. Turns out it's their special 10th anniversary bottle! I attached pictures in case anyone else gets a bottle with this special design since I hadn't seen pictures elsewhere online - it's very cute!",

It wasn\u2019t horrible, but my ears were feeling warm, looking a little red, and there was a little bit of \u201cliquid\u201d coming out from them. After doing lots of research, I washed my ears, dried them, followed by using the wound wash, cleaning them with some q-tips (made sure no debris was left behind). Once they were clean, I rinse them off one more time with open wound wash, then I sprayed this product on, and left it to dry. At first a lot more liquid came out after a few hours, then did the process all over again, 3rd day my ears were normal. I left the earrings in to help with the draining of the bacteria, as I read taking the earrings off would only cause the bacteria to stay in. I did not need any antibiotics\u2026 I have continued to repeat the same steps, and they have remained the same. Hope they get to heal all the way soon.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this spray because I've been having a lot of issues with redness on my cheeks and my nose lately. I can't blame mask-wearing for this problem because it was happening long before 'Rona came along and messed up things.I have long had skin problems (several of my reviews talk about that), and I have to keep on my toes to find solutions to problems that won't exacerbate the biggest issue I fight, cystic acne. Any products I use on my face have to be strong but not so much as to trigger a vicious breakout. This healing spray, I am glad to report, does only good things!Along with the aforementioned redness, I had these weird little bumps on my nose; they weren't acne, didn't itch, didn't anything, but OMG, were they annoying. Acne gel didn't do a thing for them. Moisturizers didn't affect them in the slightest. Witch Hazel didn't help, either. Desperate for a solution that doesn't require a dermatologist, I hit up Amazon.I'd begun to think I was developing rosacea, based on the symptoms I was seeing and what the general description of rosacea encompasses. I am no closer to figuring out what my problem was, but I can tell you this: this spray fixed it.FOR REAL.The redness in my cheeks, gone. The odd little bumps on my nose, hasta la bye-bye. The redness on the tip of my nose is still with me, but it's not that bad, and the spray is continuing to work its magic. I am very happy and super surprised this spray worked as well as other reviewers have said.The reason I didn't give it five stars? The scent. ICK, I don't like the smell at all, really medicinal. It does take a while for the smell to fade, so if you're sensitive to strong smells, go cautiously. It's like smelling salt air with a lot of old medicine in it. Odd, I know, but if you can get past that, this is THE product you need for healing skin, especially if you're going to use it for your face.You don't need more than a spritz or two. I use it almost nightly before I go to bed, and it's truly helped with redness and bumps on my face. I'm so pale I'm almost transparent, and you can imagine that any redness on me works like a strobe light (there's not enough makeup on this planet to cover me up once I get too much redness).",

Well, this year the rash is stubborn and the steroid is just not cutting it. Tried this product and in one day the rash is 50% better! I was pretty shocked and will keep using it. Edit: still working well on underboob rash and used on some itchy uncomfortable bug bites on the bottom of legs/around ankles. Had to wear a dress and was dreading the look of bug bites/redness and swelling. Well, no fear bc this product handled the itching and unattractive look in two days! This stuff is really a miracle product. An unbelievably great find!!!",
