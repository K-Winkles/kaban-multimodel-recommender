                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this toner regularly since I got it, last night I used another toner (Tea Time...not bad still just not life changing)) and a buffet of products on my face, most of which were hyaluronic acid niacinamide glycolic and vitamin c (I might avoid aha/vit c combo in the future) I woke up at three in the morning to use the loo and get some water and noticed my face was itchy... I looked in the mirror... my face was red around my mouth and underneath my eyes... I got my water went back to bed and tried not to touch it, when I woke up I could tell the skin was swelling around my mouth, nothing crazy but very concerning nonetheless bc a week before I had this same issue with my eyes, I suspect the vit c that most likely caused this issue, it was a very high concentrate and the only thing I used on both days my face acted up, sorry for the rant, anyways... I ordered this toner bc I was desperate to get my skin back on track, it was still dry and flaky from what happened the week before, that along with the cere ve pm moisturizer has helped me greatly and I should have stuck to that regimen for at least two weeks instead of jumping back to my stronger products, so anyways I washed my face real well (hydro boost cleanser, not my fave but never messes with my skin) and put this toner on... almost instant relief... within five minutes the itching was gone and the redness dissipated, I am so grateful for this product right now, if you\u2019re using vitC/AHA/BHA/PHA products this is a MUST (along with SPF 30+!!!!), I wish I got this sooner, that said... I\u2019m going to my dermatologist later today (last week was so bad I went to urgent care), this product is stopping the redness and itching but it\u2019s not an automatic salve for a serious skin irritation, it will provide relief but you need to go to a doctor and find out why it happened.",
