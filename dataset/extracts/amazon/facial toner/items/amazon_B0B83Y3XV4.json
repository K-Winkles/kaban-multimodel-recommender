It doesn\u2019t have a strong odor, which is a blessing when you\u2019re pregnant because the hormones can turn even scents you love into strange or gross fragrances. The moisture soaks into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and refreshed; I don\u2019t know if I looked any better to a stranger on the street, but when I touched my face I could feel that the skin was smoother and softer.Considering the ingredients listed, I think the masks are a bit pricey, but they sure do feel nice and relaxing after a long, exhausting day.",

I have tried their hand cream and I found it very helpful, and it is the same with this mask.It use it after micro needling and use it along with a roller to get a nice soothing a cooling effect.It has ingredients that I love, like cocoa butter, vitamin e, Vitamin C, Collagen, Folic Acid, Rosewater, Licorice, Avocado oil and Jojoba oil.It doesn't feel heavy on the skin and it doesn't have any strong scent coming from it.I leave it in my skin for around 30 minutes and after removing it I apply the remaining product that is left in the package. It takes quite some time to fully dry but it is worth it.Afterwards, I apply my eye cream and goat milk cream to complete my skin care session. And the next day when I wake up in the morning I enjoy the brightness, smoothness and softness effect that is left in my skin.This is worth it and seems to work nice in sensitive skin. There is of course, no need to be pregnant to use it and get the best out of it.",

                "reviewText": "I like that these masks have a plastic backing on them so it\u2019s easy to unfold them out of the package, and they feel wonderful while they\u2019re on the skin, but they definitely leave a gunky residue after the product has settled in and you\u2019re not wearing the mask anymore.I\u2019ve tried both patting the remaining product into my skin, which is what most of these masks require, as well as allowing it to absorb and dry on its own, and in both circumstances I would find dried product peeling off of my skin not long after.The other day I tried the patting method and after I was sure everything was absorbed I put on a sunscreen face lotion, and did my makeup as I normally would and there were pieces of my \u201cface\u201c peeling throughout the day. During this pregnancy, I think I\u2019ll stick with naturally-based DIY face masks instead.",

                "reviewText": "**Even my kitty enjoys the smell :) see photo. The scent is light & fresh. Not at all over-bearing or harsh**I\u2019ve used palmer\u2019s tummy butter on my belly, thigh, chest & arms skin for over 13 years now, since I was pregnant with twins. Let me tell you how I raved about it. Full-term, not a one stretch mark \ud83d\ude4c. Loved the smell & the moisture, so I continued forward with it. I\u2019ll try any Palmer\u2019s product because the quality & results are always there, and always impressive. I completely & totally love and trust the brand!I needed a good, light moisturizer for my face.. and I got just that. Pregnant or not, skin goes through changes as we go through life. Trust Palmer\u2019s to care for your skin from pregnancy to old age. This stuff is light, soothing, non-irritating & worth the money. A little bit goes a long way, and I don\u2019t feel at all greasy, and it does not at all burn my sensitive, rosacea prone skin. The texture of this cream is not heavy.. it\u2019s perfection & blends into skin like a dream!I highly recommend this facial moisturizer to ALL women of every age, race & skin type. Great hydration without any ick left behind \ud83d\udc4d. Pregnancy does reek havoc on skin.. as do hormonal changes later on in life. Palmer\u2019s got you covered every step of the way.5 stars!!\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f** I hope my review has been helpful \ud83d\ude0a.**",
