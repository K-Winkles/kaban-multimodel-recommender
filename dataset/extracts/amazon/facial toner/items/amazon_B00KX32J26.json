                "reviewText": "I like the fact that this toner is old-fashioned witch hazel with some rosewater. It is moisturizing without any greasy residue or cloying fragrance. The \"fragrance\" is very subtle, and reminiscent of the witch hazel we used as teens as a toner and first-aid solution for bug bites. I love this toner; this is the second bottle of it that I've purchased.",
