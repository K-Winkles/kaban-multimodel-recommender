The bottle is substantial - it is kind of heavy glass (so ended up being a little silly for travel), but looks very nice on my vanity and feels very \"quality\". The opening has a little plug stopper thing, so while heavy, it was safe in my travel bag (no leaks).The product itself is fantastic - removes all leftover dirt, tightened my pores (I have big ones naturally and this does help minimize), refreshed my skin. It was not moisturizing and you will need to add moisture afterward (as is the case with any chemical exfoliant)!!!! My skin looks brighter and less congested after about a month or so of regular daily use. I am very pleased with this and will probably keep using it going forward (contingent on my budget, lol!).",

I reviewed all suggested products and decided to give farmacy toner a try. After 2 months use, my hair stylist asked what i was doing different, she could see positive changes in my complexion. I told her just added Farmacy toner to my routine. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to reduce large pores.",
