I like this feature, especially for travel because it insures none of the product will spill or leak out. Following the directions, I washed my face and then applied the toner. It is fragrance free and felt refreshing. I noticed the cotton ball had a small amount of oil residue/make up on it when I was done. The toner dried relatively quickly and left my skin feeling clean. I have sensitive skin and haven\u2019t had any side affects from using it. Heartleaf can be very beneficial in a skincare routine so I recommend giving this one a try.",

You tilt the bottle and let it drip out or shake it to speed it up. You can easily control the amount of liquid dispensed with this design. It has a screw/twist top as the main lid. The secondary lid underneath is flip-top, as seen in my photo. I did not detect any scent or fragrance. The toner is absorbent and has a watery consistency. My skin felt soft without stickiness or oiliness. No negative side effects so far. I have never heard of heartleaf. That caught my attention. I wanted to try something new and different. I read that it\u2019s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Sounds like it could benefit me. I\u2019m near 40 and still experiencing acne. I am hoping this toner will be helpful. I need to use this longer and update my review in the future.There is paraben in the ingredients but you should not worry. Dr. V Rattan, a world renowned cosmetic formulator said it\u2019s a myth.

It has a double lid of sorts- first the twist off cap, then a little flip open piece to a smaller dispenser-type opening. It makes it easy to only get the small amount needed at once. I applied it to a cotton pad and wiped over my face after cleansing it. Even though I felt clean after cleansing, it still removed some oils and dirt that were left behind. The toner didn\u2019t dry out my skin; it slightly moisturized it, but without feeling greasy at all. The toner contains quite a few ingredients, but feels very clean, almost like water, and has no discernible smell - yay! I haven\u2019t noticed any lightening/whitening of my skin like it claims, but I wasn\u2019t hoping for it either. I do think it minimizes my pores slightly, which is good.",

It doesn't dry out or irritate my skin, and my skin actually feels more hydrated when I use the toner.The dispenser under the cap allows only a small amount of the toner to come out at a time, but if you want more, it does come out faster if you give the bottle a few shakes while putting it on your applicator.I am pleased with this toner, and recommend it.",

I had just used a very pricy face wash. The toner still removed oil residue- makeup off of my face. My skin doesn't feel tight or oily. It's actually balanced just right. One thing that seems like a good idea, but didn't work for me is the lid. It seems really convenient, but it's actually hard to open. With my fake fingernails. I do recommend this toner, it feels nice. I would actually purchase this because it's at such a great price point.",
