I just ordered my second bottle since the results were amazing! After using just a few days my skin is actually healing! I dab it on the affected area several times a day and I can actually see it healing every morning when I wake up.Light, pleasant scent, non drying, the cell turnover was nothing short of incredible. I only wish I had discovered this sooner. I'll never be without this toner ever again!\ud83d\ude01\ud83e\ude77",
