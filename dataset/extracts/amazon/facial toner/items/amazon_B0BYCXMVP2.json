                "reviewText": "I love this product. I use Infina BHA Facial Exfoliant & Facial Toner almost every day. I like that the facial exfoliant has fine granules but not too fine. I'm not into coarse granules that hurt or cause damage to my skin. This feels good on your skin, and I look forward to using it. Both facial products feature 2% BHA and salicylic acid which exfoliate, tone and are perfect for acne-prone skin. My skin isn't acne prone but it is sensitive and my skin is a fan.There is a slight fragrance, but not overpowering. I typically use the facial exfoliant while I'm in the shower because it's easier to thoroughly rinse off the granules there. I simply scrub for a couple of minutes which may be long for others, but I really like the way the product feels on my skin, and it looks polished afterward. It also doesn't feel dry.As for the toner, I like it for many reasons: one that it's thicker than water; it's slightly gelatinous. It doesn't have a watery consistency but it's not as thick as a gel, it's somewhere in the middle. So, there\u2019s better control over how much product is dispensed. After using the toner, my skin feels hydrated to the point of forgetting (or being lazy) and forgoing a moisturizer because it looks and feels moisturized after using this BHA toner. It probably isn't, but that's how it makes my skin look.I like that for both products\u2019 have aloe vera second on the ingredient list. I look for products that have aloe vera in them because I believe in its healing and beautifying properties. Sure, there's a lot of other crap in the ingredient list I refuse to attempt to pronounce, but I like the products and I like them together. I will certainly visit the storefront for more products.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice exfoliator and toner duo. It uses both chemical and physical exfoliants. The toner uses both aha and BHA as well. When using this I was very surprised but my face didnt sting which happens when I use chemical exfoliants sometimes. It does help smooth out the skin, help with oil control, and my pores do seem to be a bit smaller although my pores are naturally not huge so it's kind of hard to tell.I really like the sun exposure warning. I sometimes see products that can make you more sun sensitive (most notably retinols) but there is no mention anywhere on the product. It's almost dangerous because you can burn much easier. It's less severe of a sun sensitivity with bhas and ahas, but putting on sunscreen is always a good idea, even though I get lazy sometimes and just try and avoid direct sunlight like a vampire.",

                "reviewText": "Did not come with brand new foil under the caps. The facial exfoliant was nice and creamy with a sandy scrubbing texture for the exfoliation. Even though I got this for my teenage son( he has sensitive skin like me but with lot of pimples) I\u2019ve tried both on my monthly and it worked great. For someone who only gets pimples during that time, I didn\u2019t get any while I used this. For my son, he doesn\u2019t use the exfoliant every day, maybe every other day and the toner twice a day. Wish this was a 3 pack with the cleanser to compare to but my son likes these enough I might get it to try for him anyways. I know this is geared towards women, but my kid has my skin just with pimples and this works well for him without being harsh and drying like most men\u2019s products. I think this is at an excellent price point for the amount you get. The scent on both is mild and really neutral. If I can pin point any scent I would say slightly pineapple or papaya and it doesn\u2019t stick around. Definitely can\u2019t smell it after rinsed off. I would definitely get this again. 5 stars",

                "reviewText": "You receive Two 8oz plastic bottles one containing face toner and the other bottle containing an exfoliator. The facial toner is designed to PH balance your facial skin after you have used the exfoliant. The exfoliating process is designed to remove dead skin cells and help to even your skins tone.Both of the products are working good on my skin. I wish that the face toner had a different method to remove the product since it\u2019s so thin in nature like most toners are. Both of the bottles have flip top half moon caps. Having that type of cap for the exfoliator is perfectly fine. But since the toner is thin, it\u2019s hard to control it\u2019s flow when you\u2019re removing the product. If you use a cotton pad or cotton ball, it makes it easier to control the skin toner while attempting to remove the product.Obviously use the exfoliator fist, then finish your skincare routine with the skin toner. Neither of the products have irritated my skin nor do they have a bad scent. In my opinion, the exfoliator is in between thin to medium, right in the middle. If it was much thicker, to me it would make it more difficult to spread and use on your skin. So the consistency is fine to me. It has pretty much the same grit level as it\u2019s consistency.I Do Recommend this Two Pack of Quality Made products. They work good on my skin and are priced fairly.I Hope you find my review Helpful, Thanks for Reading.",

                "reviewText": "Two 8 ounce bottles of exfoliator and toner, this will last a year. The exfoliator does a decent job of removing dead skin cells and leaving the skin feeling smoother and refreshed. The BHA liquid exfoliant contains beta hydroxy acid, which is known for its ability to penetrate deep into the pores and help unclog them. This can lead to a reduction in the appearance of pores over time, which is a definite plus for those struggling with enlarged pores. The toner component of this product provides additional benefits by balancing the skin's pH levels and prepping it for the subsequent steps in your skincare routine. It has a lightweight formula that absorbs quickly into the skin, which is great for those who prefer a non-greasy finish.",

                "reviewText": "The face wash and toner seem to be working for me. It is really leaving my face moisturized. I no longer need to use lotion on my face after I use the toner. It does not leave me oily or dry. The face wash is exfoliating. They do not have a strong or noticeable scent to them which is good because I am not a scent person and scents give me a headache. I'm not sure if my pores are getting smaller but I do have less pimples popping up and when they do they are small.",
