So I assumed whoever packaged this cleanser broke the cap and still sent it out to the customer. But I started trying it no matter what. The first 2 days was fine, but from the third day, my cheeks started feeling dry, my skin felt too tight after using it. And it was so hard to put BB cream on. After I put some powder on my face, I can see the dry skin flakes. Maybe it's not for me (I have combination skin).",

                "reviewText": "I've used Dickinson's WH for years as a post-shave, pre-shaving lotion, tonic. Truth be told, I'm not exactly sure why other than habit but it feels good, is a nice skin bracer without any stinging, and well, that's all I can say really. I've never cared for the smell even though it says fragrance free. I will say it doesn't smell as bad as it did years ago, if at all, so perhaps I just have a form of ptsd (post traumatic smell disorder). Either way, the smell doesn't linger but a few seconds. My only complaint, and I knocked off one star for it, is that the plastic, snap open lid broke off after the very first use. It snaps back on but no longer has the little leash, a first-world problem indeed. Other than that, the product itself is 5-star, the bottle, 4.",
