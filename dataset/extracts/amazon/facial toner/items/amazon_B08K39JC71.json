The size threw me off but the consistency is more of like a milky liquid makes sense (rice water). A little few dabs on a cotton ball and it covered my whole face so a little actually does go a long way! I generally use Vitamin C toner but not suppose to mix with retinol. It got some old makeup off and did the job while Also keeping my face moisturized! Never have I tried a toner that has done that! My vitamin C toner leaves my face super dry but this is phenomenal I highly recommend this product! \u201cI\u2019m From\u201d you have a Lifey now!! And this is a lot coming from me because I don\u2019t really leave a ton of reviews.",

                "reviewText": "This toner proves to be ideal for sensitive skin, boasting a gentle and natural formula that avoids the excessive chemical feel found in other products. Post-application, it leaves the skin remarkably soft and smooth, delivering impressive results that I absolutely love. However, the only drawback I'd mention is the size of the bottle \u2013 it's quite petite, resembling the size of a battery, and priced at $10. Despite its compact nature, this can be advantageous for those looking to test it out initially before committing to the larger $20+ bottle from the same brand. So yeah just buy it you won\u2019t be disappointed, just by the size though.",

                "reviewText": "I would like to start by saying this absolutely is a wonderful toner! I am by no means a newbie to Skin Care, I use a lot of very expensive products and I also use some affordable products! I have been into skincare for years and years. I also get professional treatments etc. So with that said I just wanted people to understand, that this is not someone who doesn't know skin care, giving a review! I kept hearing wonderful things about this, by the YouTube personalities, and dermatologist I watch. My own dermatologist said they had tried it also, and they thought that it was a great product, but why overpriced! I tried the sample size. It's a ridiculously tiny bottle, the pictures people are showing you, make it look like there's more product, than they're actually is! You will literally get three maybe four, if you use a VERY small amount uses out of this! The sample size should literally have not been more than $6.00! The full size bottles should not cost more than $15.00 to $18.00 MAX! So with that said, I will stick to my other products! My other products do cost more yes, but they are absolutely worth it, considering the ingredients and size! I strongly recommend that, nobody purchase the sample size at ALL! And honestly I wouldn't waste your money, on the full size bottles either! For reference I bought the Rice Toner. This is a company that strongly reminds me of Glow Recipe! It reminds me of Glow Recipe, in the way that their products are also \"extremely\" Overpriced, for the amount you get! Glow Recipe has great products yes, but NOT for the price you pay for it! If Glow Recipes products were at least two full ounces, they would be worth it, but it's NOT worth it for One tiny Ounce! And that's the same way I feel about this brand! They have Good products with good ingredients Yes, but they DON'T want to give you enough, of the product to \"Justify\" the price! So my advice to anyone considering purchasing from this company, is please do Your research! There are Much BETTER products, out there for a much BETTER price! The products that are also out there that might have a hefty price tag, but are absolutely worth that price tag, is also justified! If you consider purchasing, some of the more bougie products, with VERY GOOD INGREDIENTS! Remember People You get what You pay for! In this situation, it's NOT worth what you're paying for it!",
