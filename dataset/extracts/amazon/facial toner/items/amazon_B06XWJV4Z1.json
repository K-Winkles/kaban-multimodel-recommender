It has Glycolic Acid as well as Rooibos in the ingredients which, I feel, make such a difference for my skin as a toner. I have used non-alcohol Witch Hazel for a toner but it doesn't give me the glowing feel to my skin as Derma e Radiance Toner. I have recommended it to friends and I stand by it as a wonderful toner for your face. I have sensitive skin (occasional Rosacea) and this product is fine with it. I actually feel that it has helped!",
