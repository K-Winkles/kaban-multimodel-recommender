                "reviewText": "I recently discovered a gem in my skincare routine \u2013 the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner, and it has quickly become my go-to for a daily dose of hydration and care. This toner is nothing short of a skincare symphony, providing a harmonious blend of nourishment and gentleness, perfect for my sensitive skin.First and foremost, the fragrance-free formula is a breath of fresh air. Haruharu Wonder has crafted a toner that caters to those with sensitive skin, and the absence of artificial fragrances makes it a delightful experience for my senses. The focus on purity is evident, creating a toner that feels like a gentle hug for my skin rather than an overwhelming assault of scents.The star ingredient, black rice, adds a touch of luxury to this toner. Known for its antioxidant properties, black rice boosts my skin's resilience against environmental stressors. The inclusion of hyaluronic acid takes the hydration game to the next level, leaving my skin feeling plump, dewy, and irresistibly supple.I appreciate the commitment to cruelty-free and vegan practices, as well as the recognition by EWG with a Green rating. It's reassuring to know that I'm not only treating my skin kindly but also making a conscious choice for ethical and environmentally friendly skincare.The alcohol-free formula is a godsend for those with sensitive skin like mine. Instead of stripping my skin of moisture, the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner complements my skincare routine by delivering a refreshing and hydrating layer that prepares my skin for subsequent steps.The packaging is not only visually appealing but also practical. The pump dispenser allows for a controlled and mess-free application, ensuring that I can enjoy every drop of this wonderful toner without wastage.In conclusion, the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner is a standout product for sensitive skin. It strikes the perfect balance between efficacy and gentleness, offering a skincare experience that feels like a treat for my skin every day. If you're looking for a toner that cares for your skin and aligns with your ethical values, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this gem a try.",

It\u2019s a textured toner that I\u2019ve never experienced. The consistency is a thin watery gel like which soaks up nicely in my skin to help give the glowy look I prefer. It\u2019s not greasy at all which is a huge plus. For the price, you get a nice size bottle, and it really looks like an expensive skin care product.I have been using this product for about a week now, but I can already see a difference. It keeps my skin moisturized and great for layering my products.",

I wanted something to add for hydration in my skin care routine so I use it directly after I wash my face and then follow with a few serums and moisturizer and sunscreen.

I use this with several other toners, so I barely feel it.Texture: Really viscous and sticky.Scent: This is the unscented version.Hydration: it\u2019s okSome people are sensitive to fermented products or rice, so watch out for that. This is a pretty good size, seeing as a little goes a long way. The price of this toner usually stays the same year-round- not too many big deals on amazon. The price is the same on amazon and olive young as of now, so considering shipping, amazon is a better choice. For now.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this after I ran out of another toner and I will never go back! I use this morning and night as the first step of my skincare routine. The texture of the toner is a little more essence or serum-like (more viscous) than other toners but it feels very moisturizing. Super happy with the price and the convenience.",

As you can see the bottle is nearly empty and this is my 3rd bottle and I will continue to repurchase as this product provides hydration and my skin is more firm and moisturised. I used this everyday morning and night and it doesn't irritate my skin and absorbs really well! If you\u2019re new to Korean skincare I recommend you get this toner and if you haven\u2019t tried this toner then literally go purchase this immediately!",
