But it did not burn or irritate my skin AT ALL it very much felt like it was putting moisture back into my skin after my cleanser!! feels nice",

                "reviewText": "I finally, at the ripe age of 31, am taking my skincare routine more seriously and have recently sold my soul to La Roche-Posay and am really glad I did. I honestly love all of their products and this toner is no exception. I use it right after I use their cleanser and before applying their serums and I feel like it was the missing step in my routine. It's often easy to overlook toner or downplay its benefits but this one not only feels effective but is also affordable and will last you a while. I think La Roche-Posay is top notch and I'm really glad I incorporated this into my routine. And I have oily/sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all which always feels like a major victory!",
