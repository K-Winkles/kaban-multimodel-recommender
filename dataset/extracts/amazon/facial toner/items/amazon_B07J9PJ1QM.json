                "reviewText": "I love this toner! I've tried a ton of different toners ranging from all natural to drugstore to department stores and this is my favorite. It truly does seem to \"balance\" my slightly oily skin. It makes it less oily, but by hydrating it, not by stripping all the natural oils. The aromatherapy scent is very mild and never irritates my sensitive redness prone skin. After washing my face I pour a little bit of this into the palms of my hands, rub them together and pat all over my face. I let it set for just under a minute then I apply a moisturizer. I've noticed this toner really ups the moisture in my skin and allows my moisturizer to glide on really well. That extra hydration has really plumped up my skin. You can also remove extra residue from your face after washing it by using a cotton pad to wipe the toner over your face. I use it to wipe around my eyes if I have some eye makeup residue left over. I don't even need an eye cream afterwards because that's how moisturizing this is! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I love this toner! If I could afford it, I would spritz it all over my body and not just my face. I got it to use during the warmer summer weather. It is light, refreshing and gentle. It feels clean and it works well under all my other products. I just wish the bottle was bigger so it lasted longer. I'm already on my 2nd bottle, i think one bottle lasts about a month? After i wash my face I do spray quite liberally on my face and onto a cotton pad. There is no strong scent and it's not sticky. I've also started spritzing it midday to refresh my face, which feel so nice, which makes me think this would be great if it was spritzed on cold, like out of the fridge!",

Now we both use it before applying any serums to our face. I intend to send a few bottles home to my friends in the Caribbean.",

I tried a lot of different things and did not really like anything until I tried this magic Green Tea Matcha Balancing Toner. I can see a real change on my skin after starting using it. I definitely recommend this toner. Just try it and you will see a result.",

I\u2019ve always had relatively clear skin with the exception of periodic breakouts, but my face gets REALLY dry and it\u2019s an uneven complexion. With that being said, my skin feels clean, clear and moisturized after a spray! It\u2019s super easy and fast, and smells nice (kinda herbal) love that it\u2019s natural. My face truly looks revitalized, moisturized and fresh. I can tell when I haven\u2019t used it. Moderately priced, but it\u2019s worth it! Buying again!",
