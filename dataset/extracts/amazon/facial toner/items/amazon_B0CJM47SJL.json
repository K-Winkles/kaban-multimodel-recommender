I'm a middle aged woman who gets a few blemishes a day, especially when using beauty products. The promise of a non-irritating option to control this sounded amazing. It's the first time I've used a hypochlorous acid spray, and I like using it. It's refreshing, coolong, and feels nice in general. I do wish it was a finer mist, but it gives good coverage as is. But I have not noticed a significant difference in how many blemishes I get. It does help to calm things down a bit, especially when using it at night, but I guess I was hoping for a miracle that would end blemishes for me and that's certainly not what I got using this product. I do notice a difference on days when I don't use it, thiugh, so I still use it regularly. I had also read this type of product could be good for eczema, and saw no difference using it for that on the few times I tried.",

                "reviewText": "I fell in love with Tower28's SOS Rescue spray earlier last year, when I realized I had bene overpaying for what was essentially diluted hypocholorous acid spray. This spray from Honeydew Labs is a fraction of the price at $16.95 (at time of writing) and provides a 0.015% concentration of HOCL, which is the same concentration as the Tower28 spray. The mist nozzle sadly does not dispense a fine mist as I would personally like, but that is easily fixable by decanting the spray into another bottle of my own choosing.",

I would get the bigger size if I end up getting it again.The spray is nice, smells almost like a swimming pool but not as strong but I actually like it.I find that it has a dry affect that tightens up the face a little and I\u2019ve had some bad acne lately so I was going to see if this would help and so far it didn\u2019t do anything crazy for that unfortunately but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this is fully intended for anyway.I must say though it\u2019s definitely refreshing to spray on after a shower, smells good and my face does feel clean and a little better, just not the big difference I was hoping for.Price isn\u2019t too bad though at all, it\u2019s refreshing, smells good and I honestly will probably try and get some again in the future because I have oily skin and I found it dried my face up more decreasing the oily forehead I get often.",
