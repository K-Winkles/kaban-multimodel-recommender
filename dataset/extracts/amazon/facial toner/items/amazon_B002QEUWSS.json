It has a delecate clove scent and soothes my 50+ yr old skin making it feel dewy and youthful.Since I hit 50 I noticed drastic changes in my combination skin. IDK if it was menopause, aging or newly living in the north year round that has made my lovely Combination skin DRY! :(Another \"50-something\" recommended routine facials and it helps tremendously along with Dermalogical's Antioxidant Hydramist ~AGE Smart. I cannot afford to have facials more than once bimonthly so the Hyrdramist is great for keeping me feeling like I just had a facial. :)I purchased the Travel Size for $14 ~ Very convenient! I fill it up from the larger bottle ;)HIGHLY Recommend! :)https://a.co/d/jcEB6pr",
