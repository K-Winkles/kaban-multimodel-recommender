                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing a review on this, and the ETUDE SoonJung pH5.5 Relief Toner to provide an accurate an honest opinion. I ordered these hoping to switch from my Farmhouse Fresh products that really didn't do much for my skin. My skin is sensitive and most always looks red, irritated, textured and dull. My t zone is oily but under the layer of oil you can clearly see dryness, and it was most evident on my forehead which highlighted fine lines. I'll usually have a pimple or 3 at any given time. I have some thick sideburns that I get sugar waxed and that area is rough and gets little bumps from hair growing back a couple weeks later. My neck is... Textured? Like kinda bumpy looking, is the best way I can describe it, I breakout on my neck somewhat often, too. My skin is not my friend.To prep I washed my face with FMF Green Tea Milk WashBRIOTECH Topical Skin Spray (new product implementation at this time)And we're reading for this relief toner.... My first impression was that this toner is soothing and moisturizing. I've never had a moisturizing toner and this one really does not disappoint in that department. I applied to a cotton round and applied it on my face and neck. My skin felt wonderfully soft already. On initial application my skin turned pink, as I would swipe the product on, but felt no sting, burning, itchiness or any other adverse effects.After toner I applied one of my favorite products, Cellfood Oxygen Gel.Next, the 10 Free Moist Emulsion... Two pumps to face and neck. It is silky and lightweight, it absorbed well, provided really good NON greasy moisture! This one is big for me because I've never had a moisturizer that didn't make my face look slick and greasy.. well maybe I have, but those products didn't even hit the bar on adequate moisture to begin with.Almost 3 months in and I have used half of the toner, and I think a quarter of the emulsion. I LOVE it! I can attest to the claims of providing relief to irritated skin, several weeks ago I tried out a new physical sunscreen and it broke me out like crazy after two days, especially my neck, it looked like hives. I discontinued use immediately and that night went through my normal skin routine: green tea milk wash, briotech topical spray, pH5.5 relief toner, cellfood oxygen gel, 10 free moist emulsion and went to bed. Washing my face the next morning my skin was already halfway back to how it has been since I first incorporated these products months back. I love that it doesn't irritate my skin in any way, it looks the clearest it's been in gosh... I honestly don't know how long. I never had new acne pop up, in fact I believe it helped speed up the clearing process.My sideburn area stays soft as hair begins to grow back and my neck looks noticably smoother, and it greatly improved the dry fine lines on my forehead. I can't say anything negative about this product. My skin loves it, and I love my skin again.",

                "reviewText": "Everything I tried made my skin burn & peel, even \u201csensitive\u201d cleansers or toners, and even the things that worked for me last time my skin got like this. (I think they changed the formula of the stuff I had used before). This product offers instant relief for the sensation, and my skin is gradually healing too.I first got it in the set of Etude House foaming cleanser, barrier repair cream and this toner. The cleanser is good and calming but does result in a bit of a drying /tightening sensation for me afterward. I tried each item separately for a while, to see if anything gave me a reaction.The cleanser is very gentle, but for my skin, I do need something after it to keep the moisture balance. The barrier repair cream in the gift set is good, and is light for a cream, but a bit heavier than the toner. It doesn\u2019t make me break out or anything, but it does feel a bit heavier coated, while alleviating the slight drying feeling of the cleanser.This toner is super light and watery- isn\u2019t a moisturizer or lotion at all, but it does the trick. It not only soothes the skin & helps with that \u201cdrying sensation\u201d from the cleanser, but it is also very clearly healing my rosacea-prone peeling skin. I found that it helps to reapply throughout the day, and you can soak a cotton round and leave it on your face like a mask.The gift set only came with a small bottle, so I bought this bigger one and now I\u2019m can use it throughout the day. I\u2019m seeing so much more improvement. So glad to have the large bottle & I hope they don\u2019t change the formula!",

And thought that\u2019s how toners were meant to work. So, I stopped using Etude after 2-3 times.A couples months later- Incredible! I can't believe the impact this product had on my skin. At that time, I had already been using tretinoin for three months and was desperately seeking something to cool down my face. I had given up on Etude House before, but decided to give it another shot. And boy, am I glad I did!Etude House turned out to be the best thing for my skin. The refreshing and cooling effect was just what I needed, especially to soothe the burning sensation from using tretinoin for the first time. Moreover, this toner keeps my face super hydrated all day long. I still use moisturizer, of course, but the toner seems to work like magic, binding everything together perfectly. As a result, my skin feels amazing, and I've even noticed a youthful bounce returning to it. An unexpected bonus - people even started carding me again!",
