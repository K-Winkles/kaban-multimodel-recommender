I ordered it right away. Prices are the same but delivery is almost 2 weeks faster than YesStyle. Not overly drying for my skin even in Wisconsin's winter. After cleansing amd washing my face, I put this on a cotton pad and wipe my entire face with it. I can still see the leftover dirt or whatnot on the cotton pad. Decreases my breakouts.",

When I first used this it did burn quite a bit but once I continued to use it my skin got used to it. It has helped a bit but overall not much has changed. I definitely think that if you have sensitive skin like me you may want to try something else such as Anua\u2019s 77% or MEDIPEEL Phyto Cica-Nol (this one works best for me)But I wouldn\u2019t say this is a bad product. Definitely try it out if you are looking for a decent toner and if it doesn\u2019t work look for another one. What I have realized is that people\u2019s skin are all different, even with the same skin type people\u2019s skin will respond differently to certain products. You just have to try things out until you find what is right for you!",
