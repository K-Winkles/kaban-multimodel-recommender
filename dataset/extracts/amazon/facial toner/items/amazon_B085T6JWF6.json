                "reviewText": "These Some By Mi 30 Day Miracle pads are great. They are standard size if you\u2019ve ever tried toner pads before, not the oversized ones that are becoming popular now. They\u2019re your typical pads that are textured on one side, and smoother on the other.I find that these have ampoule toner, but not too much that they drip everywhere. They have a slight minty smell to them, but the scent isn\u2019t overpowering and dissipates quickly. They are slightly moisturizing, but since they\u2019re an acid, you\u2019ll need to moisturize and apply an spf in the daytime (which you should anyway).If you\u2019re used to strong acids like 2% BHA or more, or AHA peels (10% and up), then these might not be strong enough for you. That being said, I love that I can use these twice a day with no irritation. They helped keep my face clear, but I think I need a stronger BHA in my t-zone where I tend to be more oily. If you\u2019re scared of acids, haven\u2019t really tried them before, or have sensitive skin, you should give these a shot!For reference, I have normal/combo skin. Normal in the winter, but get oily in my t-zone in the summer or if my skin gets dehydrated. I have sensitivities to fragrance and alcohol. These did not irritate my skin.",

                "reviewText": "i\u2019ve used this product for 2-3 weeks now and i can say this product definitely helps with any texture you may have on your face. your face will feel super clean after using these. i like to use them as a mini sheet mask and use two a day (one on each cheek). they are a bit small, but they are really well soaked.(hack: flip the container upside down while you store it so the top pads stay saturated!)if you have a face with more surface then i recommend getting the mediheal toner pads because they have big square shaped pads that you\u2019d be able to use more as a mask :)",
