I thought it was a bit pricey but, this product actually goes a long way. Literally two drops is plenty. If you like smells not perfumes the citrus orange is strong. I have a dark complexion especially during the summer. I could see the change and the glow. Read the instructions as it may change the time of day you choose to use the product. Overall, will definitely buy again.",
