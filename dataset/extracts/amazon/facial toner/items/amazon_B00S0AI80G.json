I have had dry skin my whole life and it's very noticeable on my face, especially in the winter. I have tried other facial lotions and the only other one I've used that worked consistently was BareMinerals buttercream, but I am not a fan of the price and was on the lookout for a more economical option.This is now my go-to hydration product for multiple reasons. I have fine lines which have been present for years, and this product reduces their appearance. The price point is just right. I have dry skin and apply this after showering, which locks in moisture and keeps my face from drying out during the day. It is much lighter than other moisturizers and is also not sticky like others; I use about the equivalent of a quarter's worth (maybe a little more) to cover my face and neck. A little goes a long way which means that I may only have to replace this once a year, if that, so it's also a great value. The smell is clean and fresh; it has no overpowering scent. I also really like the glass bottle it comes in and how not too much comes out when I need to apply.Overall, I am highly satisfied with this product and will purchase again.",

The product is pink in color and is very hydrating once you apply it on the skin. You need a very small amount though as applying too much will make your face look oily. As for anti ageing will have to wait for results but there is no instant plumping of skin given that it's a collagen cream. It's a good summer cream for my dry skin as it's gives me gr8 hydration . But will I buy it again . Not really. I still prefer my play total effect range of serum. Day cream with spf and night cream",
