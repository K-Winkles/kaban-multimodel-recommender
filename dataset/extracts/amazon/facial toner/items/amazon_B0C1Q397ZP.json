I was told to soak gauze pads in witch hazel and chill them and use them to soothe my swelling and bruising. I just started using it today and I am pleased that it did not burn my eyes. I know it is alcohol free but I still had concerns. I am not a fan of the smell of rose water but this is so subtle and relaxing. This is so worth the money for me. I hope to update later.",

Perhaps the Aloe/ Glycerin?I\u2019m not sure what is so different about this brand but my skin loves it! I don\u2019t wash my face in the morning. Instead, I use this on a cotton pad to clean my face in the AM before applying my moisturizer and at night after washing my face (before skincare). My skin looks so bouncy and even. I\u2019ve had some really stubborn bumps on my forehead that sulfur and benzoyl peroxide couldn\u2019t even tackle.For some reason, this did!The price is a lil much in my opinion but well worth it.",
