So far, so good - it's been about a month since I began using this and no breakouts! The smell is a little off-putting - it smells like bleach - but that quickly dissipates. I use this twice a day, morning before makeup and evening after cleansing. My skin is looking good these days and I think this is one of the reasons why. I'll keep buying.",

Not sure if it's worth how much money it is especially since there are more affordable facial sprays containing hypochlorous acid. It also did not last very long... However it is still a nice product and I would still recommend it to spray after a workout to kill bacteria if you cannot wash your face right away! I just think it is too expensive to use as a toner morning and night.",
