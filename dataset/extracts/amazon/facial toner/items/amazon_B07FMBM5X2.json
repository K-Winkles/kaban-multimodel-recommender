And they are perfect for the heat of summer - I put them in the refrigerator in the summer, and then take one with me, to spray and revive me, during the acute heat and humidity of summer. Their scent is so delicate and refreshing - a truly perfect facial spray and spirit reviver. Thank you AMAZON for carrying these perfect and reasonably priced facial sprays! And hot weather reviver! I will never live without them.",

All I use is this facial spray, because it's great for cooling off in the summer and I love the smell of roses. That said, the rose scent is nice, subtle, floral, fresh. The lavender scent is oddly medicinal and a little icky smelling. Maybe it's the chamomile? My husband can always tell when I put it on, even he thinks it smells a little off. If I buy this again, I will only purchase the rose scent.",
