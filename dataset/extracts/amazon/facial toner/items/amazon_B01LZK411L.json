For normal, oily, dry, and combination skin types. Acwell Korean Toner for Cleansing has a pH of 5.5, effectively resetting the skin's natural pH after cleansing.",

            "HOW TO USE: Saturate a cotton pad with the cleansing water and gently sweep across your face, moving from the center, outwards. To help remove stubborn makeup, press a soaked cotton pad against your skin for a few moments to help dissolve the makeup before sweeping it away."

I was motivated to buy this cos I was looking for a moisturizing and gentle toner without harsh chemicals. After reading rave reviews about this toner I finally got it. I\u2019d say I was pretty impressed by the performance. Smell wasn\u2019t as overpowering, it\u2019s actually pleasant. After using this toner I noticed that my face got visibly brighter overall. I can\u2019t say it has done a good job and fading my pigmentation marks cos I think that\u2019ll take longer than a few months to see significant improvement. I\u2019ll keep using this because it\u2019s so gently on my skin. I\u2019ll keep on using this as I love the brightening effect it gives every time I use it.",
