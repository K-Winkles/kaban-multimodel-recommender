                "reviewText": "I am a huge fan of d'Alba Piedmont. I love most of their products I've tried, and I probably have about 12 or 13 of those in my bathroom closet right now. They produce high quality, affordable skincare products that are such a pleasure to use, and this product is no different. This one is a little tricky, though. Some of the product information says that it is a serum and water in one bottle. That's true, and the bottle must be shaken before using to mix the oily ingredients with the water-based ones. But instead of using it as you would use a serum, this is intended to be used as a toner, so it goes on your skin directly after cleansing. In Korean skincare, toners and essences follow cleansing, and they are meant to help prepare your skin for the treatments that come next (usually serums). I apply this stuff by pouring a little bit into my palm and kind of patting it into my skin. I like to use a few layers of this toner before moving on to the next step in my skincare routine. I find the pop-top dispenser a little bit annoying to use, but it would minimize waste if the bottle should get knocked over. The fragrance of this product is very light and pleasant, and it does seem to hydrate my thirsty skin pretty well. My skin is fairly sensitive, but I haven't noticed any reaction or irritation after using this toner.I am definitely enjoying the hydration this toner provides, but my favorite thing about it is that it is 100% cruelty-free! All d'Alba products are, so you don't have to worry about your purchase supporting any ugly animal testing. And guess what? A clean conscience leads to fewer wrinkles! It's a win for everybody!",

                "reviewText": "I HAVE SUFFERED FROM SKIN CANCER \u2013 OUR FAMILY HAS ALL DIFFERENT SKIN CARE NEEDSI am going to start by telling you that I am a middle aged man who is now paying the price for neglecting his skin in his youth. I have had a couple bouts with skin cancer. Just yesterday, I had to visit my dermatologist to deal with more facial skin issues. My daughter is a young adult who struggles with the skin issues that most her age tend to face. My wife, of course, is timeless. She has issues with oily skin.WE ARE EXISTING CUSTOMERS \u2013 I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN \u2013 CAN\u2019T USE PRODUCTS WITH ALCOHOLThe point is, our entire family has been using D\u2019Alba products for quite some time for all different reasons. My wife, daughter and dermatologist have strongly urged me to take better care of my skin, and toner is now part of it. So, I was very curious about this toner because it is made by D\u2019Alba and it does not contain alcohol (I have very sensitive skin and can\u2019t use anything with alcohol).OUTSTANDING PRODUCT \u2013 SMELLS GOOD \u2013 BETTER THAN WHAT I ALREADY USE IN SAME PRICE RANGETo put it succinctly: This product is AMAZING! It does not irritate my skin at all. **(I recommend testing on a small area of your skin if you are concerned about sensitivity.)** The product I use now is in the same price range and it also does not contain alcohol. However, the D\u2019Alba toner blows it out of the water. I have tried many products, but this one truly delivers. An added plus is that it also smells nice.KOREAN SKIN CARE PRODUCTS TEND TO EXCELAs a side note: Our family has found that Korean skin care products are pretty tough to beat in terms of effectiveness and quality. This product is no different.FINAL THOUGHTSNo exaggeration, this toner is amazing. I will be a permanent customer of this product. Period.",

Toner licked out everywhere in my bag when I tried to tighten and close it well it never worked. I bought this and after three days it was gone because it spilled all over place.

                "reviewText": "This is quite a nice conditioning toner for the face. You will need to shake it up before using because some of the properties have a tendency to separate. Easy enough. Pour a little in the palm of your hand and splash along the face or you can pour some into a swab or makeup removal pad to blot along the skin.Feels quite soothing while applying. Very refreshing and conditioning to the skin. There is a scent to this that is a little bit more floral than it is citrus, but it's very pleasant and somewhat on the mild side. Those who are scent adverse might not like this, but the rest of us will most likely enjoy the scent. I know that I do.It's very clean and does not cause me any sort of irritation at all. Though it's lightweight, it will provide you with some extra moisturization. On those hot and balmy days, this is good to use when you don't want to load up your skin with other heavier skincare products. You'll get your toning and clarifying, as well as a good bit of moisturization. Once it sets, it does not leave the skin feeling oily or greasy.Good for all skin types and is just as good for men as it is for women.",
