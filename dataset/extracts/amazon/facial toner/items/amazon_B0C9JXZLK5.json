This very gentle formulation fits the bill. I am very sensitive to botanicals and so I was a little cautious (marshmallow is used in this). But no redness or irritation. Just a nice fresh feel, so I use it after a shower or after directly washing my face. I have even used it, in a hurry, in lieu of a good facial wash. Then my moisturizer can go on afterwards without reacting against anything. Very gentle yet refreshing.",

                "reviewText": "PLEASE NOTE-- This has been updated as this product has changed.I get the unscented plain witch hazel. I am used to the floaty things as I do understand it is a natural occurrence of a natural product.HOWEVER, my most recent bottle purchase has me convinced there is absolutely NO witch hazel in this at all-- none-- and my nether regions would agree. NO floaty things but no witch hazel either!This latest bottle I feel has the marshmallow extract only-- it is like heavy water if that makes sense. BUT no witch hazel is in this-- unless they waved a fine mist over the bottle before sealing it so the ration is 1 million parts of water to one part witch hazel.Bummer, now I have to look elsewhere for witch hazel, cause this heavy marshmallow extract water does not contain enough witch hazel to be effective. Buyer beware-- there is no concentration listed on the bottle but I'd suspect the witch hazel content is ten percent (and that is being generous with my estimation) so you're paying for probably over 90 percent water)There is no detectable classic witch hazel smell either. NONE.My first bottle of this stuff was good, my second and now third bottle from Amazon are trash. Buyer beware.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my first review before I'd been duped into buying water on amazon:I love this product and use it on my nether regions, regions that we don't chat about much but need gentle cleansing and healing more than a cleansing wipe can accomplish.If you read the disclaimer before having a freakout you'll realize the floaty things are supposed to be there-- if it were perfectly clear that would be a hint there was no marshmallow leaf extract in there and your witch hazel wouldn't be naturally preserved.You ever cut a potato and have your cutting board (and the potato) discolor? Nothing wrong with it, just a natural process. So stop with the \"it has floaty things in it\" stuffs LOL. It is supposed to-- that is a natural reaction in the solution and actually means things are good.All I can say is this stuff works better than anything.I am a bit concerned of recent posts that say they've been duped into buying water/watered down product.I'll post again with an update if my next purchase isn't up to par.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased this product at least five times now. It is currently unavailable and I am worried that it is no longer going to be sold. I originally had bought this witch hazel to add to my peri bottle and help promote healing after having my son. It was the only witch hazel I could find that was alcohol free and didn\u2019t have any added or harmful ingredients. I believe that it helped immensely with my healing. I had some left over and remembered seeing other review(s) of people that used this as a face toner, so I decided to give it a try on my face. I had been struggling with sudden adult acne for years and nothing else seemed to help. I figured it was gentle enough to use for my postpartum care that I might as well try it on my face. I am very glad that I did because it helped so much! I now use this on my face twice a day. Please don\u2019t stop selling this, I cannot live without it! I\u2019d also like to add that because I\u2019ve purchased this product so many times I can attest that the company has added a safety seal to the product. Don\u2019t be scared off by the other reviews stating there were particles floating around in the bottle. This is because of the natural ingredient used to preserve freshness. I highly recommend this product!",
