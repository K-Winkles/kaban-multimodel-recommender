It looked like a The Ordinary copycat, but did NOT use the name in the photos or description.However, the bottle I got has all the normal The Ordinary branding. Packaging has same info. Packaged the same way as the ones I've bought from The Ordinary.This is the \"glycolic acid 7% toning solution\". (The Ordinary has renamed it as \"glycolic acid 7% exfoliating toner \" but I don't know if they have updated boxes and bottles yet. On their website their product photos are NOT updated but the name of the product IS updated.)So everything is correct when I compare it. I'm not noticing any difference using it. It is darker toned than my current The Ordinary bottle. But I've experienced some color variations in previous The Ordinary bottles. Anywhere from almost white to a yellow color.But, what is it? The product doesn't match the photos, or the product description, and with the extensive the Ordinary branding, I just don't know what to think.Giving three stars because it seems to work fine (so far it works just like The Ordinary I have at home already) but I'm unsure if it's real or not.",

Secondly, the color of the actual toner looks different (darker) to the ordinary toner, which makes me really question the authenticity of this products. After using it 5 times so far, I haven\u2019t had any irritation or allergic reactions on my face but I\u2019m still skeptical, considering the other factors. Most importantly, I haven\u2019t noticed any difference in my skin since I\u2019ve started using it. It doesn\u2019t really smell like the Ordinary toner either so it makes me question if this is indeed a counterfeit product. This is also priced a little cheaper than the Ordinary one. I would not recommend this specific product, considering the factors above.",

I don't really care about brand names or anything, and I usually just get my skin products based on ingredients instead of brand. I took a picture of the full list of ingredients so you know what you're getting in case you're curious about all the ingredients, like me. The product didn't cause any irritation and it does not have any odor, so both of those things are good. However, it didn't really feel like it was doing anything to my skin either. There was no tingling or anything. I guess time will tell. I did not like it all that there was no safety seal on the bottle and the carton was smudged/dirty.",
