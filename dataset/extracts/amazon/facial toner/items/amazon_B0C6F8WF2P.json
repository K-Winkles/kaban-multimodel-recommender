                "reviewText": "The most user friendly skincare product with kojic acid I've tried. It doesn't get any more simple than cleansing and spritzing this on my face a couple times a day. The mist comes out fine, but a good quantity comes out and I can get my whole face and neck in two to three sprays if I sweep down each side of my face. Have not noticed any difference in my face, but I think this is one of those products that helps with the cumulative effect of consistent skincare. It dries pretty quickly and doesn't make my skin feel greasy or dry, just slightly hydrated like I used a light toner. Would recommend to anyone wanting to add a product with kojic acid to their routine.",

It does not have a scent and doesn't irritate my skin despite the many powerful ingredients. I have very pale, very sensitive skin, so any changes would be immediately visible.Make-up goes over this well. It doesn't pill or cause patches.I can't speak to long-term use yet, but I have long used many of the ingredients in here (like niacinamide and glycolic acid) so I will update if there's any change to the usual effects (even skin tone, improved skin texture, etc.).",

I've often seen little to no benefit from many of them. This one I did and the biggest difference was in texture. My face has felt much smoother the past couple night when using this (guessing it's the salicylic acid which has always helped me with texture). My skin also felt more hydrated. It provided a much better base for my hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizer. It's called fragrance free and while I did pick up a very slightly chemical scent, it's not bad. My main issue and why I can't consider using this product going forward is it's not cruelty-free, or at least it doesn't state it. I will only use products not tested on animals. So, I'll keep searching.",
