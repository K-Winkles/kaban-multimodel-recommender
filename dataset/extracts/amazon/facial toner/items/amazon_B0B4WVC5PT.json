This is a skincare line I've come to love for how gentle and effective it is for my sensitive skin. I use the cleanser that goes with this first, pat dry, then spray the toner on problem areas. For me, that's my chin and neck. I wait a few seconds, then use a microfiber towel to massage the toner into my face and neck until it is dry.My acne is hormonal so topical skincare only helps so much but this does the job better than others I have tried, and without burning or being too drying. The misting bottle works very well and the spray is a very fine, light mist so you don't use too much product. 5/5",

                "reviewText": "I am in my late 40's with extremely dry, sensitive skin.This comes completely plastic sealed so any tampering would be evident. The bottle is white plastic so there is light protection. The issue I have with the packaging is that the bottom of the bottle is rounded and I seem to knock it over as often as I set it up successfully.The pump is typical press spray and didn't take any priming. It is a fairly thick spray and uneven, no gentle mist here. The product feels very wet . . . mostly because it releases so much with every pump.This has a very light fragrance but I doubt that it is an added fragrance with how subtle it is.Application, once dry, is not sticky, shiny or tacky.In general, I tend to see facial sprays as more treat than treatment, and this certainly falls in that category. I haven't seen an improvement in my skin, and I don't find it particularly moisturizing. I didn't have any negative reactions from my skin, but also can't say that I got any benefits other than a refreshing wake me up.",

                "reviewText": "*I started using the toner, serum, and moisturizer from Reflectionz the same day. Steps 2,3,&4 of their skincare routine. I used my current face wash and I also continued to use my vitamin C in the morning and retinol every other night. When my face wash runs out, I will absolutely be buying this brands face wash.This hydrating toner does exactly what it says, hydrates. You can apply this with the spray directly into your face, or use a cotton pad. I enjoyed spraying this directly onto my face, it felt cool and refreshing. One spray was a little more than enough to do my face, so I patted some on my neck too. I've been using this for only a few days, but I feel that my skin looks brighter, and my face definitely feels more hydrated than normal throughout the entire day.",

                "reviewText": "This product arrived nicely packaged, in a clean tamper-proof bottle. There was no leakage. It has a pleasant, barely perceptible scent. I have been using this daily for more than a week, about 4 sprays to the face after washing. It feels clean, light, and refreshing.Here's the rub...I'd been using plain old witch hazel for toning before trying this product, and to me, the witch hazel feels MORE refreshing, cleaner, lighter and cooler. It has proven effective for my pores and you get twice as much for half the price. I will continue using this to see if there are any noticeable long term benefits, but I highly anticipate I will be returning to witch hazel once this supply of toner is depleted.",

                "reviewText": "This toner is pleasant, but I think overpriced for what it offers. I'm used to a toner with slightly more astringent to remove debris in the pores. This one is very soft and gentle, but so isn't doing that function. I like that it's almost scent free. I spray it onto a cotton pad and dab on my skin. I haven't noticed extra moisturizing, but I do like removing those last vestiges of cosmetics before bedtime.",
