I felt a bit disgusted seeing all of the dirt keep coming off with each but off cotton wipe. My face lit up a tiny bit after using this and it didn\u2019t give my face an oily look. I had to check a few times because my face seemed beautiful but natural as if I hadn\u2019t put any product. Usually when using a product, I feel like I can tell and it makes me feel a little bad. I don\u2019t want too much shine or glow but I\u2019m aware that most beauty products do that. I didn\u2019t have to worry about this one though. It did its job without making me stand out from feet away and I had more icky stuff removed from face than ever before. I would definitely get this one again.

It seems like a lotion at first, but once it makes contact with the skin the texture changes completely and it becomes very liquid-y. It moisturizes really well, and honestly for some people, you could get away with just applying this or skipping some steps of a skincare routine.

The product is called a 'toner' \u2013 but as a self-proclaimed skincare aficionado, I\u2019ve always found that a toner is most often a liquid solution that can be misted or applied to the face using a cotton round. This feels more like a lightweight water-based moisturizer (and the instructions state to use this product as the last step in your skincare routine, which also indicates to me that it\u2019s to be used as a moisturizer). Either way, I am loving it! I also love K-beauty \u2013 the products are on a different level, and nine out of ten times, they work perfectly for my skin, which can be a bit sensitive. I\u2019m especially enjoying this product as the weather is getting warmer. It\u2019s refreshing, absorbs quickly, and leaves my face feeling buoyant and hydrated. I have combination skin, so I tend to get oily in my T-zone, and this product doesn\u2019t leave behind or generate any greasy residue to accentuate that. High quality product!",

                "reviewText": "This toner has made my skin feel so soft. I use it at night and in the morning before I put on my daily sunscreen. It is lightweight and has made a difference in the appearance and the overall condition of my skin. I have been using the product for about two months and my pores are less visible and some spots that had been irritated have cleared up. I have sensitive skin and this product has caused no issues for me.",

                "reviewText": "This was a lovely gel toner from a reputable company. I thought the toner was on the thicker side so I used it more as a serum, finishing with 2 layers of moisturzer. It absorbed nicely and wasn't overly sticky.",
