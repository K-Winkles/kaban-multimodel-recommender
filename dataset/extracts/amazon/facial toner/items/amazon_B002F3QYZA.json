I don't understand why you can't find this in stores. Thankfully Amazon provides this for purchase for now. Hopefully they will continue to do so. I combine it with a hydrogen peroxide cream on active pimples. I have had severe cystic acne since i was a teen. Accutane helped but even the dermatologist was surprised how persistent my acne is. Luckily the acne is on my back and chest and not on my face. I don't want to go back on Accutane because of the harsh side effects so for now i'll use this. Will update if I run into any issues.",
