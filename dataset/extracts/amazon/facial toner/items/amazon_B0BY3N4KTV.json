It also hydrates my skin a lot but doesn't make it super oily like some toners tend to do to me.I really like this toner, it settles into my skin nicely and feels good and makes my skin look and feel better.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, simple toner. The fragrance is subtle, like a combination of rosewater and a very light citrus. The ingredients are overall quite gentle and the texture is smooth and provides good hydration.The one area where I have mixed feelings is regarding how it\u2019s advertised as a turmeric toner. While turmeric is relatively high on the ingredients list, coming in at 6th, there\u2019s no way to know at what concentration. So more than likely, the majority of hydration is coming from the first 5 ingredients. That\u2019s not to say that the turmeric is insignificant, there\u2019s just no way to know for sure.Lastly, Amvital seems to be a solid company. They have declarations on their website about sustainable practices, lack of GMOs and rigorous quality testing. However, there\u2019s no proof of those claims. As a consumer who\u2019s new to the brand, it would be very meaningful if they actually published this data rather than just mention it.",

I initially found it odd that you must spray it on, as you have to close your eyes to avoid spraying into them, but with a few uses, I have found it to be very easy. Because the spray is so fine and light, it is easy to control and it dries very quickly. I actually think it helps with some of the redness in my face, but I cannot be certain.",

Initially, I thought it had cloves in it because it\u2019s scent reminds me of cloves, but there\u2019s no cloves in here. This did not leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy, and it absorbed quickly into my skin. It\u2019s very hydrating, and just a really nice moisturizing toner with turmeric in it. Turmeric has great skin care, benefits, and I have never seen one before in a spray toner",
