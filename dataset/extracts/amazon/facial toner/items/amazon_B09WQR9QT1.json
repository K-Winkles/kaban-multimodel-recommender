                "reviewText": "I've tried several toners over the past couple years, and this JOAH toner pad product is very similar to two other products I've tried this year: Celimax blemish toner pads and Pyunkang Yul calming toner pads. All three of these are very similar because these provide toner in the form of pads rather than liquid in a bottle that needs to be dispensed via separately purchased pads. I like all of these products because of the convenience these provide, and while these tout different benefits, the results are largely the same for me. While JOAH is the least expensive of these three at a current price of $12.99 compared to $16.99 for Pyunkang Yul and $20 for Celimax, when taking the number of pads into account these prices result in $0.26, $0.24, and $0.33, respectively. While JOAH and Pyunkang Yul cost about the same per pad, since each Pyunkang Yul pad is significantly larger it's also the best buy. All of this said, my favorite toner continues to be Natural Outcome Man Skin, the best of the ones I've tried. I've been giving myself a clean shave less often the last couple years, and I continue to use Natural Outcome after clean shaves, since I'm already spending a lot of time shaving, but the rest of the week when I shave myself with a stubble guard I use toner pads instead, because I'm trying to save time from the daily routine.",

First time trying this brand and I like it!I've used toner pads before but this is smaller than what I'm used to. Instantly cooling and refreshing on the skin! If you're a fan of micellar water or astringent as toner, you'll love these! They're very gentle, made of 100% cotton, soaked in essence, and don't leave fluff on the skin.This is formulated for sensitive skin but will benefit all skin types. It doesn't come with a plastic tong like others, but not really an issue for me.",

My faces feels so refreshed and bright after use and along with my hydrating spray, vitamin c oil and retinol face cream, I've become obsessed. Very well saturated and two-sided pads where one is exfoliating, and one is smoother. I don't know if it's meant to be used two ways, but I do when I'm looking for a smoother application.",
