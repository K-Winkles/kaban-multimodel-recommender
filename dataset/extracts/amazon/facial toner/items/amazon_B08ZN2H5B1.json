                "reviewText": "This toner was perfect for my sensitive/slightly oily skin. It has a very minimal refreshing scent to it and feels nice and moisturizing on my skin. My t-line is very prone to pimples and my forehead is oily and gets the most pimples so this greatly helped improve my skin. I have been using it for around 3 months everyday and its no where near finished. Overall great product.",

First, I have very sensitive skin that reacts badly to strong chemicals and this felt so soft and natural, it calmed and moisturized my skin right away. Second, the scent was floral but light and natural, actually made me want to put more on just to enjoy the smell. And lastly it comes in a light but sturdy bottle that is easy to use, carry in case of travel. I will definitely buy more of this and related products!!!",
