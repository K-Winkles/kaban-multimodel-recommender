                "reviewText": "As a k-beauty junkie, I have tried many different skincare items over the years and one ingredient I always go back to is tea tree.So I've tried quite a few toners in the Korean market that have tea tree as the main ingredient but this toner, it's literally only ONE ingredient! It's just tea tree extract water!After finding this out, I had to try it and I've only been using it about 2 days and I'm already seeing some good changes in my skin. I live in a hot state (thank you Texas) and I have oily skin with large pores so not the best combination. This toner not only helped with the state of my pores, it actually feels like my other skincare products are sinking into my skin and doing work!This might be a great answer to my problem so I'm writing this review so hopefully others will take note of this product and Amazon will keep on selling it. I hate loving a new product and then immediately getting sidelined when Amazon decides to stop carrying it.I know the bigger brands in Korea usually get more love, but these more unknown brands need some attention too. Especially when they produce toners in bigger sizes than the usual 5oz, which by the way, doesn't last very long when you're an avid toner user like me. Please keep this in stock Amazon!",

It makes my skin feel very nice and when it absorbs it gives my skin a nice glow this is just after one use so I can\u2019t say anything about long term affects",

                "reviewText": "(My skin type: oily combo hormonal) I bought the centella toner because my skin is hormonal and flaring up and my skin can get really sensitive and dry suddenly from allergies and psoriasis.I've honestly only used it 5 times and when I usually use it, I drench a cotton sheet mask in it and leave it on my face for 15 minutes to soothe my skin then swipe the sheet mask over my face and neck.Doesn't make noticeable changes to acne so far (but my hormonal acne is usually stubborn and takes a good couple of weeks to clear up again), but it definitely helps to soothe my skin when it's itchy and irritated. Also helped when my skin stubbornly wouldn't absorb any essence or serums. After washing my face during a bad allergy flare up.",
