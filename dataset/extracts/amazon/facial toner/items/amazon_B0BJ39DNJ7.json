Can't recommend this enough for dry and dehydrated skin types, especially during the winter!",

A brand I\u2019d been using for over a 10 years, and would tone my face cheeks nicely, changed their ingredients! And stopped working for my skin!! I was soooo annoyed! I have sensitive skin. I went through a few other toners from other brands, with bad reactions, so went without toning my face for months!! Boooo! That had me anxious!I had my eye on this particular product for a while, but the price had me on pause (economic crisis..hellooooo)\u2026 BUT! Milk ? Hmmm. Let\u2019s try something new. Let\u2019s break the bank\u2026 BINGO!Face smooth straight away. Face glowing straight away. Skin looking like new skin cells has just taken over. I noticed an immediate reaction in my skin from day 1! I looked \u2026. RENEWED! REFRESHED!It\u2019s now been a few weeks, and my cheeks are starting to form their list tone again. Woohoo. And I do have good skin in general, but wow, so many compliments on my skin these days! Or \u201cyou look well\u201d (\ud83d\ude05) But I did change my face cream too\u2026 lol. May write a review on that lol.Bottom line, this product is worth every penny and definitely one I cannot live without! Looks like it\u2019ll be the next contender for the next 10 years or so! Hopefully it will still be around and NOT CHANGE its ingredients! If it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it!I was not paid to write this review. This is my honest review, thoughts, and opinions :)Happy shopping everybody!",

The ingredients include Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Mandelic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide and Ceramides and It is made for dry and combination skin. It is alcohol free, fragrance free, parabens free, vegan and cruelty free too.The packaging is not exactly luxe (I am a sucker for nice packaging!) but it is perfectly okay. As I said the texture is a bit different but I liked that it really gets rid of all traces of cleanser and makes my skin feel mattified and ready for the next skincare step. I am not particularly keen on the fragrance which smells a bit clinical but it soon dissipates. I cannot comment on the price, as it is currently unavailable, but it\u2019s quite a good toner, probably not my favourite, but it does the job well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have combination oily skin that gets dry sometimes so I don't have an issue using products meant for dry skin and have not had issues with this toning milk feeling too heavy.The product is easy to work into the skin and it is quite thin so you only need a little bit to cover the whole face.I can feel a little bit of tingling when applying this toning milk but it is not too uncomfortable and doesn't last long.Results:I have been using it in combination with their Triple Moisture Water cream and these 2 products have really been healing my skin from acne scarring and I also get a lot less breakouts. The pores look smaller, I have less post acne pigmentation and my skin overall looks much healthier. If I happen to have picked my face these 2 products have a really healing effect and the next day my skin is not irritated anymore.Highly recommend this even if you have oily and problematic skin.",
