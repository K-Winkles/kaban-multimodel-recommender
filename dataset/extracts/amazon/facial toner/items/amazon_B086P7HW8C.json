It also targets fine lines and wrinkles and smoothes texture. But this powerhouse AHA toner has a soft side, too. Infused with sandalwood, chamomile and licorice extracts, it\u2019s gentle enough for daily use. Tone post-cleansing for a skin-smoothing boost, and you\u2019ll be perfectly prepped for serum and moisturizer.",
