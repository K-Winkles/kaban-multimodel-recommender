I have dry, acne prone skin and a lot of toners do not work with my sensitive skin. But this product works wonders! I always wake up with a baby smooth face but not oily! I even put this on my arms! I always forget to put lotion on at night, but I put the rice water toner on my arms instead. So far, it feels like I\u2019ve never forgot my lotion in the first place. Now imagine the double whammy. It does have a small natural smell of rice but that\u2019s a good thing\u2026. It\u2019s actually made with rice\u2026 the fragrance is natural so it won\u2019t hurt the face or anything. I highly recommend using this! Love it so much! Now remember, little goes a long way!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m really surprised by this product. I was using a very strong toner because i had dark spots on my skin but it makes my skin really dry so i had to put alot of cream and serum on my face. I started looking for a toner that is gentle for my skin and i saw this product. I\u2019ve heard about how rice and korean products are actually good so i bought this just to try it out. But i was so amazed on after just 1 week of just using this, it made my skin glow! My face is so smooth and soft, i can\u2019t stop touching it lol. I only use a little amount of cream or serum on my face now which is a relief because i hate it when i have too much chemicals on my face. Would definitely buy this again and again and again. Love it!",

All the other toners i have used never did what I wanted until i bought the this one! Some of you guys know that korean use rice water (yes literally) as toners for their face. Since i do not make rice everyday, it is hard for me to do this. This product is an substitution and I love it.",
