                "reviewText": "I'm 22, and I have awful hormonal cystic acne breakouts on my chin - you can see the scars a mile away. Usually, once I start seeing flare-ups all I can pretty much do is buckle down and ride it out. Riding it out takes about a month, a lot of cysts form and cluster and get very red, then I can't help but pick them out of desperation and they end up purple and horrible and inflamated. I've cried over this. A few days ago I bit the bullet and randomly got this bc it said that it helped with cystic acne and oh my god. I had 3 cysts on my chin developing and 2 are already pretty much gone and the biggest one is on its way to being gone. You can still see the redness, but when I press down on them they no longer hurt and feel VERY small. If I keep using this for like a week I feel like they'll probably be gone completely. Steadily but surely it's helping out the most out of all the remedies and face washes I've tried. It stings a tiny bit (like, VERY little for me, it's hardly noticeable) and I feel like people who have had peeling/burning problems have been applying it wrong by using too much. After I wash my face I do my face routine on the rest of my face except for my chin, then, I take a cotton swab, put a dollop that fits on the swab and I apply it to my entire chin area, rubbing it in. Really, the most you should be using on an entire area like the chin is about as much as you can fir into the tip of your pinky. Sometimes I double it but it should evenly spread and not be visible (aka, don't just leave cream dollops visible on top of every cyst) have a thin layer on the area. I've only been using it a few days but my jaw doesn't hurt when I open it due to the skin pulling on the cysts so I count that as a win. I wasn't expecting to see overnight results and it doesn't give you that, but you can definitely start seeing the difference in less than a week.",

                "reviewText": "This product has helped immensely, but before my personal review, I want to address a lot of the issues people who have rated this product lower.1: Benzoyl peroxide will bleach clothes/ towels/ eyebrows etc. I used Proactiv (which is 2.5%) and it bleached everything, I personally have had less of a problem with this one, but it still happens.2. Benzoyl is one of the strongest acne treatments you can use. It will cause drying and redness. Start slow and build up.3. Never start using benzoyl by just slapping it on your face, especially for sensitive skin. Benzoyl can be harsh so swatch it on a small portion of your skin and see how it reacts. That will save you a lot of time and pain.4. You can't treat acne and expect it to work overnight. It takes 30-90 days to start seeing a real change overall in your skin.5. Just want to say it again: BENZOYL PEROXIDE WILL DRY YOUR SKIN! Period, the end. It's battling excess sebum and so it will make your skin dryer. You may want to consider a heavier moisturizer and always drink plenty of water.I've been using this product for 2 months now and it has helped immensely. When I started I had already been using benzoyl 2.5% (which had always worked before, but not anymore) so, desperate as I was I disregarded all I know about skin care and went immediately into applying it twice a day. I did have a lot of redness as a result so I dialed it back to once a day for a week (I suggest to use it at night). To combat dryness I kicked up my moisturizer up a notch (I actually use two moisturizers, but I am using a 10% benzoyl cleanser as well) and my skin is balancing out nicely.One thing that I LOVE about this product is that there is no smell! Proactiv smells TERRIBLE and I expected this to be the same, but there is no scent and I am incredibly thankful for it. It is lightweight and soaks into the skin very quickly.2 months ago I was crying every day because of the huge, painful, cysts that were constantly growing on my face and now I am not. This isn't some miracle product that will just get rid of acne, I have an entire regimen that this is a part of. But before I got all of the other figured out, this was already helping to decrease the size of the cysts and their frequency within the first 15 days or so. For the price, that can't be beaten. (Some products that can help even more can run you $70 + for a month's supply- this is a drop in the bucket).I think if 2.5% isn't doing it for you and 10% is killing your skin, try this out. Just start slow and be patient. Know that, for really bad stubborn acne, this won't be a one and done either. I know that a lot of people using this are used to oily skin and are worried about too much moisturizer. If your skin is over dried you can still get acne. Pay attention to your skin and if it is staying dry maybe find a creamier moisturizer. I, personally, use a vitamin E cream as well. I also suggest products with Hyaluronic acid as it is love.Also, to make sure your skin stays HYDRATED, drink water. Water. Water. Water.I would recommend this product to add to your routine.",

Since this is labeled as a \u201cstronger\u201d formula, I expected more. I\u2019ve had this product for more than a month now and I still go through acne.",

Unfortunately when I went to dry my face after I rinsed it off it bleached my brand new grey towel. I was not happy! I ended up throwing it as I thought if it can do that to a towel do I really want that on my face. No thank you!!! So if you do choose to use it make sure to use a white towel to dry your face afterwards",
