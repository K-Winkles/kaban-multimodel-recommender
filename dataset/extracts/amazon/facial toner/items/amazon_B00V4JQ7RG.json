                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Simple yet effective- but I don\u2019t use this over makeup",
                "reviewText": "Other than the Cica (cantella asiatica) that is in this mist, there are actually two other soothing ingredients: Panthenol (a humectant which is also used for barrier repair) and Allantoin (another humectant that protects skin and promotes wound healing). Other than that, there is Sodium Hyaluronate (another form of hyaluronic acid) and Betaine (another skin protectant and humectant). A lot of people spray their face with water before they apply serums so more moisture can be brought into their skin by their serums, and to ensure their serums absorb deeper- except I use this instead of water. That way I can also fix my skin irritation at the same time. This stuff has only 5 ingredients other than water so it\u2019s light enough to do so. I also think that for that reason there is no way this stuff can break you out. So essentially this is always my next step after toner. But this spray only has one ingredient that kind of acts as an emollient in its formula (it\u2019s mainly a solvent) and the rest of the ingredients are humectants. Because of this I\u2019m pretty sure that if you spray this on your face AFTER putting on lotion, oil, or makeup, there is a high chance the \u201chydration\u201d it provides will literally only be those 20 seconds your face is wet with the product- and when it dries, your skin will still be at the same level of hydration as it was before. So I\u2019m shocked people are using it that way. I don\u2019t think there are enough ingredients in it that can retain the moisture the humectants capture. But if you like that refreshed feeling with a little bit of soothing power instead of something that can actually rehydrate your skin then keep using it that way- IMO, other than using this to increase the level of hydration my serums give me, I think this is a good way to calm the skin without having to use an entire serum to do so, which allows me to use my other serums that target anti aging or brightening instead.",

I have less problems with tightness or dry spots. Applying before thicker skin care items, like my retinal or night cream, helps the product glide over my face easier without diluting the product! I haven\u2019t had any issues with this toner pilling up alongside other products. Also a great price point compared to other brands, and performs the same if not better than its competitors. All around a great hydrating product!!",
