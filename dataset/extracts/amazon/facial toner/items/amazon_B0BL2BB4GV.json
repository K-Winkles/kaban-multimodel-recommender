                "reviewText": "This product is my holy grail!!! It\u2019s so good and I would 100% recommend to any skin type. So this product has niacinamide, and it\u2019s known to: control oil production, reduce redness, fade dark spots, AND MOISTURIZE!!! I have combination skin, so my skin is polar opposite like the North and South Poles. Part of my face will be dryer than a desert, while the half produces enough oil to cook 20 piece chicken meal. Having this skin type can be very difficult, as I might find a product that works like a charm to reduce oil, but it may cause the other half of my face to dry out and start peeling. When I tell you that this product was able to control my oil that half of my face was producing WHILE STILL BEING MOISTURIZING!!! NEED I SAY MORE! If you have dark spots all over your face: Glow Recipe - niacinamide dew drops If you have very oily skin that needs controlling: Glow Recipe - niacinamide dew drops If you have dry skin that needs moisturizing AND a product that can be used as a base for makeup (note that it can be used as a primer, but I would still use it with another primer): Glow Recipe - niacinamide dew drops I would recommend this product 100%",

                "reviewText": "I started out using The Ordinary Niacinimide and while it is really good it is a pretty heavy serum. I did find I had to apply vary sparingly or it would be very tacky for a long time. It also seemed to be a bit irritating since I used it morning and night. These Dew Drops were recommended by a make up influencer so I decided to try it. As someone else mentioned I did find it very sticky and tacky but if I let it sit 20 min or so before applying anything else it has soaked into my skin and is no longer tacky. I am not sure how others use it and put on make up right away. Maybe they have drier skin that soaks it in faster. I only use 1 pump and it goes on so smooth, smells nice and is very hydrating. I would recommend it.",
