                "reviewText": "Sooo I usually buy the tea tree water toner spray from lush but it's just a little expensive for not a whole lot (not that much of a price difference) so I decided to try something new.. so far I definitely like the lush spray much better but to be fair I have only been using this toner for around a week. I thought I'd give it a shot considering I absolutely love their exfoliating scrub!! But the issue I have with this spray is the smell & that's my fault for not reading carefully. It's cucumber scented and I already hate cucumbers but personally I just feel like the scent is not that great in general. Though, it's not unbearable.. I just wish I could try it without the cucumber. I will say my skin has felt softer after using the scrub and spray (idk if that's just the scrub, spray, or both?) but my acne is still not improving, which I definitely need to give it more time but so far the scent is almost a dealbreaker for me. I am planning to give it more of a chance, especially because I don't want to waste it. But the only way I will continue using this instead of lush again is if I dramatically see a change in my skin by the end! So I obviously have a lot of very personal opinions about it & everyone is different but truly, I feel 50/50 about it so far.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been struggling with breakouts for about two years and was skeptical about how much this toner would help, as I\u2019ve tried many products and even 2 different medications (none of which seemed to help much). I was having 2-3 new breakouts every day, some ofwhich were painful and all them them embarrassing. I used the toner 3 days ago at night and felt like I noticed an improvement when I woke up-no new breakouts and my skin seemed to feel happier and less irritated. I thought maybe it was just a coincidence, but after 3 days using it at night and in the morning, literally no new breakouts for the first time in years. My skin also feels healthier, less irritated, and the scarring even seems to be healing faster. I\u2019m not sure why it has worked so well for me, but if you\u2019re struggling with your skin, I highly recommend this! It\u2019s also not drying at all, smells great to me, and feels so gentle on my skin. I\u2019ve also been using a tiny dab of pure tea tree oil on spots and feel like that is helping them heal faster too. I could not be happier and already feel more confident having my skin be healthier in just a few days.I can\u2019t wait to see the continued results.",

I\u2019ll usually spritz a bit after washing my face, and it just smells so fresh and clean, not overly fragranced at all. It absorbs well into my skin and makes it feel refreshed and hydrated. I\u2019ve been using it as a setting spray and it also does wonders getting my makeup to blend and stopping me from looking like a dry Daley mess when I use powder. I love how much you get as well. I\u2019ve been using it almost daily for almost two years and just now ran out! I hope Oleavine stays in business forever and continues to make this product!",

                "reviewText": "I REALLY like this product. It works--fast! I purchased this because my skin has been a little unhappy with the cold harsh weather. I've had a few pimples pop up, as a result and normally I just use Witch Hazel, which isn't strong enough to get rid of pimples fast. THIS product is! I noticed improvement after ONE use. My daughter, who experiences teenage acne is also using this product and her skin is improving quickly as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural product to clear their skin and keep it from breaking out. The fragrance is a light cucumber mixed with tea tree oil scent. It fades very quickly but I find it pleasant when putting on my face. I prefer to use on a cotton ball versus spraying on my face. Just my own personal preference.",
