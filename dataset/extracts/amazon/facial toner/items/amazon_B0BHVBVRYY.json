I was using the anua toner pads, which were amazing, but I disliked that there wasn't a refill option and it didn't fully get rid of my texture. So I bought the MEDIHEAL Phyto Enzyme Peeling Pad and it got rid of my texture in the first few days I started using it. Its hydrating and makes my skin so soft and smooth. Theres not even a HINT of texture. I took one star off because the fragrance is so strong. It was almost to strong to the point where I thought about returning it and going back to anua. But the results are just too good to return this toner and I'm so happy with my skin right now.",

I love it sooo much till I am putting it on auto order and praying the formula doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019m an oily girl with large pores around my tzone especially my nose/cheek area. Never been acne prone so I can\u2019t speak to that. I was shook when my skin started giving a lil glass skin and this product was the only thing I changed in my routine. I added tretinoin recently and WOWWWWWZZZAAAA!!! Those 2 products together gives glass skin!! I\u2019m ecstatic!! Believe the hype and just know it doesn\u2019t work unless you do aka be consistent! I was using it consistently for 1 week day & night and I could seriously tell a difference. A true noticeable difference that made me ask what\u2019s in here?! Also I\u2019m a sensitive skin girly to the point where I always have to get a skin calming treatment after facials because my skin freaks out EVERY TIME \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f IYKYK and I haven\u2019t had any issues with this product turning my skin red or any type of reaction to it and I definitely did a patch test first causeee yeahhh! So I recommend you do the same! No burning or irritating.. it\u2019s very refreshing and the pads are very thin but juicy and contains more than enough product for full face + neck each use. I\u2019ve been using this since October and I still have plenty left & today I just found out they have refills for this!! A win is a WIN lol",

My face had gotten super dry and flaky in the summer due to trying out a toner that didn't fit my skin type. I had to keep exfoliating my face to take off the dead skin from the dryness. I started my first pack in August and just finished it. After the first few uses, I noticed how soft, refreshed and hydrated my face felt. It has minimized my pores and goosebump-like bumps on my face. Very happy with my results so far.",

I have sensitive and acne prone skin so it\u2019s difficult to find a toner that won\u2019t eat at my skin. This is so easy to use, so gentle on my skin, and it smells very nice. It comes with little tongs you can use to carefully take one pad at a time and then you gently run it over your skin. You can feel it moisturizing and doing it\u2019s job. It feels nice and it leaves my skin looking and feeling nice. I do still moisturize once it\u2019s dried a bit and my skin is doing amazing. It\u2019s been about a week of use for me and I already know I\u2019m going to stock up on more. I also love how much of the product you get for the price.Mediheal has always been a brand I\u2019ve loved and I\u2019ve used their face masks in the past.

I have only been using them for a week and I do notice small improvements in my pore size. But I also notice a serum like feel on my skin that doesn\u2019t really dry down and small bumps on my skin mainly on my chin and forehead, which are not a problem area for me. I don\u2019t want to fix my pores to have a new issue to fix! I\u2019m not sure if anyone else has had this problem, my skin isn\u2019t reacting well to it or I got a bad box?

                "reviewText": "I really love this product! After one use, you can definitely see a change! My skin was hydrated and glowing. It\u2019s perfect for dry skin even oily skin. I\u2019m combination skin, but in winter my face is very dry. Also, I really enjoy the cool effect of these pads. I would definitely repurchase again! Sadly, they don\u2019t sell the refill for this pad on Amazon.",
