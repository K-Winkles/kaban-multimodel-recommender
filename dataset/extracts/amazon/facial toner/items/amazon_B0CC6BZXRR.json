Cooling effect\u25cb Not overly runny/watery for a toner, could double as a serum\u274cDislikes:\u25cf Fragrance! Potential irritant that I avoid due sensitive skin, surprised they found this necessary for a toner! Granted, it is an unusual and kind of nice fragrance though. Can't pinpoint what it is but it clean seeming but also seems like it could totally be a bottled lifestyle fragrance, could be unisex probably which is nice. Strength is about a 6 out of 10, does dissipate slightly when you spread on skin but still there\u25cf Slightly stings sometimes\u25cf Not necessarily bad but I do notice a faint shimmery iridescence which is unexpected/odd!\u25cf Slightly tacky finish",
