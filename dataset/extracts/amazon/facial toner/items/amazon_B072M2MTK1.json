The 4oz spray provides effective hydration, leaving my skin feeling refreshed. The natural scent, although not my personal favorite (I'd rate it a 3), is subtle and NATURAL smelling not like a parfum or additive which is good for the skin. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a practical addition to my daily skincare regimen. If you're seeking a straightforward product for everyday use, the SVA Organics Rose Water is worth considering. Something I would like to see in the future is maybe adding Urea or glycerin if possible",

I started using this to spray on my skin when I would get like that, and personally, I have found it to be soothing, with a nice cooling feel. I also use this for certain uncomfortable female related issue as well, and it will moisturize and sooth the itching really well, and pretty quickly.I don't let this run out, I keep it on hand at all times, and appreciate that the bottle is on the smaller side and feels portable enough to travel with. It is definitely rose scented, so it is a light, floral, feminine scent, which might not appeal to everyone.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with this particular rosewater spray has been rather disappointing, to say the least. At the outset, I was drawn to it because it claimed to be organic, promising a natural and pure product. However, my skepticism grew as I used it over time, and I began to question the validity of its organic label.Firstly, there's a lack of transparency regarding its organic certification. It's concerning that the product doesn't provide clear information about the source of the roses used or the production process. Without these details, it's challenging to trust that it's genuinely organic. I expected more openness and assurance about its authenticity.Furthermore, the scent and consistency of this rosewater spray didn't match my expectations. Authentic rosewater is known for its delightful and refreshing aroma of roses, but this product seemed to lack that characteristic scent. Additionally, the texture and sensation on the skin felt slightly off. I couldn't help but wonder if the ingredients were truly what they claimed to be.In the end, my doubts about this rosewater spray's organic status and the authenticity of its ingredients overshadowed any potential benefits. I believe it's essential for products to deliver on their promises, especially when they market themselves as organic and natural. Given my experience, I would advise others to consider alternative rosewater sprays from more reputable sources that provide greater clarity and assurance about their quality and organic certification.",
