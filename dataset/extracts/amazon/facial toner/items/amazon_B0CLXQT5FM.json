                "reviewText": "These toner pads from EFILOW eliminated my need to use cotton rounds and were my first time trying pre-moistened toner pads in general. I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised with the flip-top design, ingredients, and experience of exfoliation that the toner pads provide!Coming in a good size of 100 pads, the price is great because that means I have 100 days of toner to use. You only need one pad and the flip-top design of the jar makes it so easy for me to grab a pad and close the lid much quicker instead of unscrewing a bottle or jar. :) The pads themselves were well-moistened and a good size. They were lightly stretchy and very gently exfoliating.I didn't notice any smells or added scents in the ingredients which is great for those who have sensitivities to smells! The ingredients were good quality for toner and had good moisturizing ingredients such as hyaluronic acid as well as calming ingredients such as centella. I did notice a lack of redness over time on my skin after a week and a half.If you are looking for a good-sized toner and don't want to deal with cotton rounds for toner application, this is a great option as the 100-count pads is excellent for the price. :)",

These are the EFILOW Heartleaf Biome Trouble Calming Pad which come with 100 toner pads that are full of serum. I generally use these after my double cleanse (Oil cleanser and Foam Cleanser). There are two ways I use these pads, the first being taking a few and doing gentle rubs along my face going from inside out. The second method I use is taking 2 or 3 of the pads and leaving them on my face to absorb for like 5-10 minutes and just allowing the toner to penetrate my skin. After I do that step I follow with my standard toner or moving straight to my essence.I mainly use these pads during my PM routine to get the best benefits. The pads come in a can that is full of toner serum and very hydrated pads. On the cap there is an included tong to help you pick up each toner sheet so you keep them clean and prevent contamination. The closed container keep the pads fresh. The pads definite help my skin routine.",

The jar has a tiny tong to remove each pad keeping them hygienic. The pads have plenty of toner on them, keeping them moist until the end. The scent is faint, smells fresh. I have used them after washing my face and before applying light makeup and each time my skin feels clean and calm. The redness in my face, especially in my most sensitive areas, seem to mellow down. The toner does not feel drying, my skin feels refreshed and moisturized. This brand has 100 facial pads, and each pad is big and durable, not small and flimsy. I definitely recommend these for their effectiveness and their price.",

                "reviewText": "The calming pad works wonders for me! The pads don't have too much of a scent - maybe slightest hint of lemon? The pads are big enough to act like a miniature face pack. The pads are easy to use - the tiny tong that clips onto the lid is a nice touch. There are excess liquid (toner?) at the bottom of the container and it seems to keep the pads well soaked. I have a sensitive skin and so far, I've had no issues with these. When I use the pads like a toner, my face feels really clean after use. And unlike some of other toners I've used, these make my face feel hydrated after use even before I apply moisturizer, which is awesome. But you can also use it like a mini facial pack - when I have some localized redness (minor allergy usually), I apply these pads like a pack and leave it there for a bit. It works wonders and calms/soothes the area quickly. I love these so far!",

The ingredients are on the box. But the manufacturer should add them to the listing. The product is in fact made in Korea. It's got the expiration date stamped on the box which is in 2026. So it's good for about 2 years. It comes in a posh looking peach plastic container. These don't cause me any irritation and help make my skin soft and smooth. I like them",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been seeing the main ingredient trending all over my feeds so I was really excited to try it and now I definitely understand the hype. My skin has definitely been both brighter and clearer since I started using these toner pads. The toner is packed with awesome ingredients that my skin is loving. Beyond the product itself, the packaging on this is great. It comes sealed really well and there\u2019s a set of tongs that attach to the lid so you don\u2019t need to use your fingers to get the product out. There\u2019s also a ton of the toner inside and each cotton pad is super saturated so one is more than enough for me to cover my entire face and even onto my neck and chest afterward to get the most use out of it. Definitely going to be reordering these once I finish them up!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve learned over my years of skincare that I can never go wrong using Korean products! This one does not disappoint, as I expected. I am currently pregnant so I am extra aware of what I put on skin, since it is much more sensitive and temperamental than normal. These pads are very lovely! The packaging is great, the pads themselves come very saturated in product, and I love the little tweezers that are included on the inside of the lid to keep my fingers from touching the pad underneath.I use these as a toner after cleansing and drying my face. I go over my entire face, avoiding my eyes, let the product dry, which takes about 30 seconds, then follow up with my moisturizer. My face is left glowing, plump, and extremely soft. I am so happy I found these and will continue to use!",
