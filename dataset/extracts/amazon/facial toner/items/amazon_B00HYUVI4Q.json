                "reviewText": "My wife says the pink YonKa lotion is one of a kind... the absolute best for her skin, dry in the winter and normal/mixed in the summer. She's using this YonKa toner for the last 16 years and can't live without it. Offline, YonKa is only available through cosmetic salons and not always easy to procure, so over the years she has tried countless other toners found more conveniently in stores: Lancome, L'oreal, Chanel, Yves Rocher, Bioderma, but it seems nothing compares with this alcohol-free YonKa toner for dry/normal skin. She insists that it gives great elasticity feeling to her skin and smells heavenly with a delicate rosemary scent, which perks up in the morning and relaxes at night. She also loves its quality spray pump, which delivers a very fine mist, with 2-3 uses/day the 200 ml. bottle lasts about 4 months.I'm happy to have found this seller on Amazon.de, which delivers reliably my wife's favourite YonKa facial toner even here, in the Canary Islands - 5 stars for the product as well as the seamless delivery.",
