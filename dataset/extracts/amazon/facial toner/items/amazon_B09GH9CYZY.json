                "reviewText": "I have been using the Bliss Disappearing Act Toner every morning and evening (a liberal amount, about 4 squirts onto a cotton round each use) since I first purchased it on 3/14/23 (along with my regular skincare routine using a different brand) I have seen a huge difference in my skin now going on just over two weeks of use!I was pretty skeptical at first that an extremely affordable toner could improve the overall health and appearance of my skin so dramatically, as well as completely fulfill its claims to diminish the size of my pores, purify them without stripping my skin and smooth out the entire texture of my facial skin. But I now see that this very affordable, clean, vegan and cruelty free toner (I only use clean, vegan and cruelty free skincare products) lives up to its name and promises like no other toner I have ever used before. And I\u2019ve used quite a few toners at much higher price points. Simply put, my pores have never been this clean and nearly invisible before. Nor has my skin ever looked this smooth and felt this soft.I initially purchased Bliss Disappearing Act Toner because I had a lot of blackheads/congestion on/around my nose, forehead and chin with large, visible pores. I had tried many different types of products to purify and remove that congestion without any success whatsoever until using this toner.Now I feel extremely confident wearing no makeup nearly everyday. And on the days when I do wear makeup, my liquid foundation looks absolutely flawless because it has a truly smooth and seemingly pore-less face glowing out from underneath.Now that I\u2019ve found this skin changing toner, I\u2019ll never use any other toner except this one ever again. If the rest of Bliss\u2019 skincare products provide results as excellent as this toner, I\u2019ll switch all of my skincare products to Bliss!",

                "reviewText": "Can I just say how I appreciate the amount you get for the price, the affordability and the ingredients is what caught my eye because I do believe you can get good skin care at a good price but when I tell you I was not expecting to see a difference on the first use. Using this in conjunction with my rice water cleanser my skin is like a babies butt and a lot more even. I have oily skin and live in a hot climate so my pores tend to look bigger but this has made them virtually non existent. My makeup application will be flawless. I'm usually also prone to scarring and I got carried away and picked at a scab from a pimple and you can barely see any hyperpigmentation it's so faint you'd have to zoom in to my face, with continued use it will complete disappear. I love this stuff my new staple.",
