I often buy from the manufacturer directly but sometimes I forget to re-up and Amazon comes to the rescue. This was an authentic product and as a product, works wonders for my sensitive skin in combination with the seaweed line. This toner does not dry my skin out and I\u2019ve never broken out from it. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed following a cleansing (and used before lotion). I sometimes use it mid-day for a nice refresh as well. Can not recommend enough!",

It has made a world of difference in texture as well. I feel like a brand new person and my confidence has skyrocketed. I highly recommend getting this product, but go through Ulta.com or buy from a retailer at a physical store because the Amazon shipping almost completely ruined the product.",

I've never been known for having acne but I started breaking out really badly last month which left my face feeling and looking a mess & this toner has cleared my face in only 2days. I know it's too early to do a review but when a product is good, you only need to use it a couple of times to notice results. It isn't harsh at all like other toners which is the reason I never added toner to my skincare regimen but this toner is very gentle on the skin, it literally feels like I'm using water. I went ahead and ordered the glycolic facial cleanser and Whitening mask from Mario Badescu's website to help get rid of the acne scars on my face. I'm so happy that I found this wonderful product. I will highly recommend this to anyone looking for a product that works & also less sensitive on the skin.",
