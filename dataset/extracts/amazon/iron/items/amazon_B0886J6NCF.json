I bought these because they come with both iron capsules and vitamin tablets which help the body to absorb the iron. They are non-constipating and they are truly gentle on my stomach. I have had a lot of problems in the past with various iron pills, but these were pretty easy to swallow, even though they didn't taste very good. They had a bit of a maybe vinegary taste to them, but that wasn't a problem if you swallow them right away. Overall, they are a good vitamin and worth the money. I'm happy with them and I think you will be too.",

                "reviewText": "I can't thank enough for this product!!!!! It's my life saver. I went though so many iron suppliments and had horrible stomach side effects. The worst one was constipation. Nothing was gentle enough on my stomach. I got anemic and I needed my energy back. But I just couldn't take any other iron suppliments. I gave it a last try by getting these. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T give up!! In one week my energy came back. Not only they give you iron that is extremely gentle on your stomach but vitamins too. They help absorb iron faster in to your body. I seriously don't know what I would do without this product. It changed my well being tremendously!! My first positive review in a while. Especially for vitamins. So many fakes out there that promise you one thing and they turn out to be a waste of money and time. I would recommend these 1000 million times to women who suffer from anemia and energy loss. Amazing amazing!!!",

                "reviewText": "I've been taking A Active Iron for Women, High Potency Capsules with the 30 Multivitamin pill for a couple of years. The 30 multiviti tablet is included in the box and is a separate pill. It is optional to take, but believe me, take that pink tablet too, because they work well together.I've been anemic for years and I remember it took about a week to start feeling good again. These pills have brought my iron levels up to where they should be and I felt no side effects other than \"better\". Each pill is individually wrapped for a reason. The iron pill does smell weird when first opened, but has no aftertaste when taken.The iron issues with women like myself, are problematic to say the least, and often lasts a lifetime, give or take ;) I've tried quite a few brands of iron, and this combo works the best - for me.Thank you Active Iron, and Amazon for carrying this brand. I just wish they could keep it in stock. It's made in Ireland so perhaps they are having shipping issues like the rest us.UPDATE - Feb. 1,2022 -",

Doesn't seem natural and healthy to swallow a black pill. The smell hits you hard , it's like vinegar. The taste is vinegar too. Sometimes when you pop it out of the foil a black powder comes out. It appears the black iron pill capsule isn't full and spills out.",
