        "description": "End the hassle of twisted, tangled power cords forever with the Panasonic NI-WL600 Cordless, Portable 1500W Contoured Multi-Directional Steam/Dry Iron. Unlike corded irons, this sleek, ergonomic 360\u00b0 Freestyle iron uses a double-tipped soleplate to glide effortlessly in every direction for precision and speed; perfect for everyday ironing and for quilting, crafting and sewing projects. Its curved, non-stick stainless steel soleplate glides seamlessly over fabric without tugging or wrinkling and maneuvers nimbly around buttons, along collars and over sleeves, cuffs and pleats. To use, simply set the iron into the charging base and select the temperature for the fabric you're ironing. In minutes, a temperature ready light illuminates and you're ready to go. If you're interrupted while ironing and forget to unplug the base, no worries. The base automatically turns itself off after 10 minutes. When done the touch of a button on the base smoothly retracts the cord into the base to eliminate messy power cord storage. A heat-resistant carrying case snaps onto the iron and base for instant portability and storage. Adjustable steam and dry settings create the ideal concentration of steam, or no steam at all for everyday fabrics, delicates and easy touch-ups for when no steam is needed. For hanging garments, curtains and drapes, the push of a button applies a powerful burst of vertical steam to relax and remove unsightly wrinkles or creases. And with the Panasonic NI-WL600 cordless iron you can fill the iron's water tank at the sink without having to bring the whole iron with you. A durable, lightweight water tank easily detaches with the touch of a button for no-spill refills. The iron's built-in anti-drip system provides a long-life water seal inside the iron body to prevent water leakage and protect clothing from water spotting. An anti-calcium system automatically prevents steam vents from clogging by reducing sediment build-up in the vaporizing chamber of the iron. Water Tank : Detachable, Iron - Temperature Range : 176\u00b0F - 392\u00b0F.",

                "reviewText": "This is a dream to use for ironing small areas at a time, like seams and hems. The double-pointed shape is wonderful for precision work in tight spaces. It has lots of steam and gets hot right up to the edge of the sole plate. However, it doesn't retain heat for very long, so is not great for large surfaces without having to recharge it on the base. It does recharge quickly, though. Love the removable water tank and the retractable cord. It also stores beautifully in it's own case.I'm delighted to have this in my sewing room but am also glad to have a corded iron for the big jobs and heavy fabrics.",

Best thing is that it is cordless and it has a very good weight to it, it is not super light or heavy. I hated ironing with super light, cheap irons that didn\u2019t do the job.I saw some reviews saying \u201cit needs some time to get warm every now and then\u201d. I didn\u2019t even need to wait for it to warm up after the first warm up and I used it for almost anHOUR. I even ironed the clothes in my closet that didn\u2019t need ironing because it made me feel relaxed \ud83e\udd2d The whole process was so therapeutic and calming especially because there was no cords to annoy me.It is definitely worth the money, the quality is great, it looks great, it works perfectly and it makes ironing like therapy :)",

It\u2019s a nice iron, lightweight, easy to use and the power station is nice to place the iron and not worry about knocking it over and someone bumping the hot plate. The retractable cord is great to put away when not in use. Not long cords to bundle or get in the way.The only con that I am noticing is that my old iron was scorching hot, this one seems to be much cooler even on the cotton setting. I do prefer the hot setting to be hotter so that is the only downside. But in all I am happy with this iron and works fine for quilting",

                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this iron. I have shoulder, arm and wrist issues. I had been using a small Dritz travel iron for piece work since it was so much lighter than what I'd used before. I was looking for a replacement (the Dritz iron has a 2-year warranty, and that's about as long as it lasted). Other reviews comment on the size and weight of this Panasonic iron, as well as the suitability of its oval shape for pressing piece work like you do in quilting. The oval shape means there is less iron surface on the fabric (instead of a wider flat bottom there is a pointed bottom) and that also reduces the effort of ironing (some may find that it makes you somewhat less efficient when ironing large pieces of fabric (backing)--but that hasn't been an issue for me). The surprise for me was the cordless feature. I had not realized that even with a lighter iron, you will be be pulling against the weight/drape of the cord. What a difference! Like others I wondered if it would \"stay hot\" --this iron has to be replaced in its cradle (not battery operated) to keep it hot. No problem--it stays hot until I shift the fabric (piece or larger), then reheats quickly so I never notice a difference. My other, corded irons, would lose heat, but this guy heats right back up when I set it in its cradle, with no waiting. It heats up quickly, too, when you first start it. Finally, the steam function is very good, and the removable water tank makes refilling the iron easy. I couldn't be more pleased. Amazon delivery was prompt and the box (which shows what is inside) was very well packaged.",
