                "reviewText": "I LOVE this iron! I wanted a dry iron with a flat sole plate for quilting cotton. Steam irons ALWAYS leak given enough time (about 9 months for me). This is true for all the irons I've had, both expensive and not. I switched to using these irons without water, misting the fabric instead. However, gunk builds up in the steam holes even if you don't use water in the iron (misting the fabric creates steam when the iron passes over the fabric) and the gunk is eventually deposited on (usually light colored) fabric. This iron has a completely flat plate and I no longer have to worry about my iron spitting stuff.Heads up: the instructions and markings on the iron are all in Japanese except for the word \"Panasonic\". This isn't a problem for me because it's pretty obvious what's low, medium, and high but if you want your iron markings in English, this won't do it for you.The iron gets plenty hot! I saw a review that said it doesn't get hot enough. I'm not sure what they were trying to iron, but mine is more than hot enough for quilting cotton. I sometimes turn it down if it's too hot for spray starch. I don't know how it works ironing delicate fabrics at lower temps because I don't.The sole plate is non-stick and very easy to clean. I clean it once in a while when starch builds up (I use regular iron cleaning paste I got from Amazon). I accidentally knocked it onto a platic bag which melted on the plate but the plastic came right off. I suppose you might have to worry about scratching it if ironing around pins, buttons, zippers, etc., but I don't know because I've only used it on plain fabric.It is lightweight which is a plus and a minus. A minus because it's easy to knock over (see above about the plastic bag). Also, I may need to apply pressue when pressing a thick seam. It's a plus because it's not heavy which is great for arthritic hands and wrists.Caution: there is no auto-off in any position. This is a plus and a minus. Plus because the iron is always hot. Minus because safety. I stay very aware of it and so far I haven't left it on or scorched any fabric. If it falls, say on a plastic bag, it won't switch off. If you're super forgetful and rely on an iron to switch off, this isn't the iron for you.In summary, this is the best iron I've ever owned and I wouldn't hesitate to get another (especially because the price is reasonable).",

                "reviewText": "The iron arrived on time and undamaged.It is smaller and lighter than a standard iron which is nice to get into creases and between buttons. The sole plate is smooth and fully visible so one can see exactly where on the fabric the iron is. No auto switch off, is a feature i was looking for and one of the primary reasons why i bought this. This iron gets hot quickly and keeps the heat it is set on; the heat settings are accurate. The Japanese instructions were no issue, Google Translate handled that very nicely, should they be needed or wanted. A slightly longer cord would be nice but the cord is not so short that it wont reach the end of the ironing board easily.Reason for the 3star review: The description clearly and prominently states this iron is made in Japan. This is not true. This iron is made in Malaysia , which is not an issue to me. What is an issue is that the product description specifically states : \u201c Made in Japan\u201d ( to give the perception of quality) but the engraving on the butt of the iron states : \u201cMade in Malaysia \u201c.Keep lying, keep getting 3 star reviews.",
