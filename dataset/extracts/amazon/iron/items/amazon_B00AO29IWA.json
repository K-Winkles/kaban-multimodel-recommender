                "reviewText": "My previous Hamilton Beach iron, which is still working and in rotation with these new ones (of which I bought two), had been my favorite for years...until now. So hard to tell from reviews and product description if something new will replace a favorite which breaks but glad I took a chance on these.Very pleased to say that I find these Hamilton Beach irons better than my old ones. Several reasons for that. Despite some reviews complaining of the weight of these, I actually found them to be slightly lighter than my others, yet still with enough heft to press clothes without undo effort. I have arthritis in several fingers so that was most welcome.These irons have slightly more ironing surface and more steam holes which probably explains why clothes are pressed well without additional weight. Being less weighty means that I can iron a little faster without loss of pressing quality.Also appreciate that the water reservoir (I use steam virtually every time I iron) is a lighter color so I can see the water level better. My other ones are much darker. Usually have to hold them up to the light to see the level.I have noticed that the water reservoir needs to be filled more frequently but that is probably because of the additional steam holes. That is an acceptable trade-off for me and only a comment, not a complaint.",

                "reviewText": "My old Smith-Corona iron finally died the death, so it was time to find a new one. I looked at more than a dozen, and this Hamilton-Beach seemed to have the feratures I needed. The retractable cord looked like a plus, so I went for it.First impression: the iron is big.In comparing the sole-plate of this iron to my old one, they're almost exactly the same size.But the housing for the retractable cord adds a good 3-1/2 inches to the length (or height, when standing). This makes the iron seem larger than it is, and can make for some initial awkwardness in handling if you're used to a shorter iron. But, you know, the retractable cord has to go -someplace-, and it was my choice to get it, so I don't blame the size on the manufacturer.A number of reviews have said this is a heavy iron; I don't find it so. If anything, it's a trifle lighter than my old iron. And, after all, an iron -has- to have a certain amount of heft to properly do its job. With a little practice to get used to the greater length, I was soon pretty confortable handling the appliance.The controls are straightforward, functional, and well located for my needs.The iron heats rapidly -- much faster than the old one. It was ready to go in well under a minute.One caveat here is that the \"power-on light\" never goes off. On most other irons I've used, the light goes off when you've reached the preset operating temperature; with this one you just have to guess. If they fix this item, I'd give the iron another star.Steam and dry iron features both work well.Instruction manual, such as it is, doesn't mention \\how much\\ water it takes to fill the iron. I figured it wouldbe about a cup, and ended up spilling water all over on my first attempt. Turns out it takes a little over 3/4 cup.Next time, I'll know, but this information should be in the manual.There is a \"self-clean\" button which I've not tried yet, but I find that an interesting concept.The price is not much more than I paid for my old iron, 20 years ago.Overall, I am pleased with this iron, and would recommend it, Do be aware of the extra length, though.",

This iron had a tremendous number of good reviews and the price was fair, in the $30 range. Far superior to any iron I have owned in years. Multiple settings, ability to control how much steam comes out, auto shut-off (I think) and a decent weight which I like in an iron. Very important to me: retractable cord which works well. Could not be more pleased.",

This iron is very efficient, heats-up super fast in a few seconds, and just glides through the garment. The icing on the cake is that the cable retracts into the iron after usage and is super convenient to store without the hassle of dealing with a loose / messy cable hanging around the iron-board. Value for money product and is highly recommended.",
