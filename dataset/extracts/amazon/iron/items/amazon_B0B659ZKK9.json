                "reviewText": "Update: after the company saw my review they reached out to me and apologized for the inconvenience, this company has gone above and beyond to make sure I was 100% satisfied. They reshipped me a new iron and it was a hundred percent different. this one glided so easily across the clothes it was like silk. It heated quickly and got every wrinkle out of my shirt very quickly one swipe and like magic the wrinkle was gone. They have continued to keep in touch with me to make sure my experience was perfect. Which it was. I\u2019m so happy with this iron. the led screen is a nice touch. The tip of the iron is pointy allowing for easy access to wrinkles in between buttons. The steam amount is plenty enough for me. You can even hit the button for a quick blast of added steam. The iron did not leak. It comes with a cup to help you easily measure and pour water into the top of it. Which if you don\u2019t put a bunch of water in there the iron won\u2019t be heavy. One warning with that, pour slow. Or you\u2019ll end up like me dumping water everywhere the hole is a little small so the water don\u2019t go down as fast as I was pouring it out. Which doesn\u2019t really bother me. The iron itself has a self cleaning button you can push to have the iron clean itself. It also has a button to spray a mist of water to your garmet if needed. The amount of steam is also easy enough to control and change to your liking you just spin the dial in the center of the iron.. the customer service is amazing. Thank you so much for helping me get a great iron.Had to return came scratched. It did not glide across my clothes which is important to me. Kinda just stuck there. Return process was granted. It did get hot just wasn\u2019t easy to push around on my shirts. Kinda heavy for me. And the scratches on the bottom plate was a deal breaker to me.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace our old iron that we\u2019ve had for years and felt confident that it was a good pick. I wish I had been a bit more thorough in reading the reviews, particularly the ones referring to the leaking, because it shot water, and I mean SHOT water out of the steam holes. Water went everywhere and it not only soaked the ironing board, but all over the floor as well. You can see parts of the iron where water has leaked and it can\u2019t be from overuse because we only used it twice. It damaged my shelf where it was sitting as well, even though we emptied all of the water out of the well. At first I thought it was dust, but when I saw that the edges of the shelf had lifted I could see that it was damaged from the water from the iron.",
