I got these as a last effort to get some iron in my kid since she is a picky eater. Well, she eats them! Now, they aren't amazing in taste but they are leagues above Flintstones, liquids, and other tablets. I just call them morning candy and she eats them. There is a little bit of a fight as I do have to keep it in her mouth but these have been the easiest to eat so far!So far in the few days we have been taking them she sleeps a little better and has more energy. I do need to get her iron in her food, but with a picky eater, this is been helping!",

Her doctor prescribed her Iron Drops and they were disgusting so she wouldn\u2019t even go near them no matter what I mixed them with. So I started looking for alternatives...found these and bought them. I put one tablet on her plate with breakfast every morning and she loves to eat her iron. It excites her! The tabs don\u2019t melt in her mouth like they say they do, but my daughter seems to like chewing them up. When we re checked her iron levels at the doctor a month later, her level was beautiful at \u201c13\u201d. It\u2019s supposed to be between 11-14. Before these tabs it was at 10. Her pediatrician was very impressed by these tablets and even asked me to send her the info on these tablets so that she could start recommending them to her other patients!! These are absolutely amazing and I\u2019m SO glad I found them!!!!",

And yes, we tried introducing iron rich foods but he's a picky taste & texture eater so this wasn't our answer. The pedi prescribed iron drops but warned they have an awful taste AND can stain his teeth. These chewable alongside his multivitamin have been exactly what we need to keep his levels within normal ranges. He doesn't mind the taste at all and makes sure WE don't forget to give it to him lol** Make sure to discuss with your Littles doctor first because TOO much iron can be dangerous.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my 8 year old daughter who cannot swallow pills. Her doctor said her ferritin level was too low so he suggested she start on a suppliment. Shes been taking them for 2 weeks and has had no stomach issues. Its too soon to tell if theyre being absorbed or helping her yet so we\u2019ll see. I will add that I ordered the orange flavored meltaway tablets and the tablets are purple. Im not sure if they are actually orange flavor or grape. My daughter is able to chew them up with no complaints so overall, we are happy!",
