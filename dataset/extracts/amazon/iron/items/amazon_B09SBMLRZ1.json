If that isn\u2019t enough, we also boost our supplements with proprietary blends of organic fruits, vegetables and botanicals for an extra source of real whole food nutrition. Like organic broccoli, carrots, blueberries, kale, spinach, heart healthy turmeric, immune boosting mushrooms\u2026 we could go on and on and on\u2026 Naturelo... from Nature with Love",

I take mine in the evening with my dinner (around 6pm) and haven't had any issues with stomach upset at all. I've noticed my bruising is significantly less and my energy levels do seem to be improving. I can't speak on the actual levels in the blood as I haven't been re-tested but based on how I'm feeling, I'd say these work well! I am definitely going to continue to purchase this product.",
