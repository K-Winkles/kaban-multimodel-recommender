            "\u3010CERAMIC COATED SOLEPLATE\u3011This OMAIGA steam iron is equipped with a ceramic coated soleplate, which heats up quickly and evenly, gliding easily across various garments. It's super scratch-resistant, more durable, and easier to clean. The tapered tip easily navigates hard-to-reach corners, delivering a smoother and more accurate glide over all types of fabrics for 30% faster ironing.",
            "\u3010RAPID AND EFFICIENT\u3011The OMAIGA 1500W clothing iron offers superior wrinkle removal, easily tackling the most stubborn creases. It provides 20g/min of continuous steam, effectively removing stubborn creases from all kinds of fabrics. With up to 0.8g/shot of steam burst, it softens the wrinkles in your clothes. Ideal for sewers, quilters, crafters, and everyday home ironing care.",
            "\u3010LARGE CAPACITY WATER TANK\u3011The 11.84oz (350ml) large capacity water tank allows you to iron a full basket of clothes with just one fill. It features a self-clean function and an anti-calc function to remove limescale, maintaining the iron's performance.",
            "\u3010EASY-CONTROL THERMOSTAT KNOB\u3011Combining parallel and vertical steam, dry iron, and steam ironing, the OMAIGA clothes iron has a scientific steam hole distribution for even steam, more effectively removing wrinkles. Equipped with three temperature settings, it provides the optimal temperature for various types of clothing, easing ironing concerns.",
            "\u3010NOT A USED IRON\u3011Each portable iron undergoes a functional test before hitting the market to prevent product quality issues from inconveniencing customers. Therefore, it is NORMAL to see some water residue in its tank. If you have any questions about this iron, please feel free to contact us. We offer a one-year warranty.",
            "\u3010SAFETY & CONVENIENCE\u3011Designed with a 3-way auto shut-off, this powerful steam iron automatically powers off within 30 seconds if placed horizontally or tipped over, and within 8 minutes if left vertically without movement. For extra safety, if the iron's temperature is too low to generate steam, the auto-shut-off system will stop the water supply, preventing any drips from the soleplate."
