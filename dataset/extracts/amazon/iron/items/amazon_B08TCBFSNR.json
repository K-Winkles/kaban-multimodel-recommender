I take mine with a shot of citrus juice or I mix it in my morning smoothie and don\u2019t even notice it. Make sure if you need iron you\u2019re also taking a vitamin that helps absorb it like vitamin D and K - I also needed ferritin as well. Make sure you\u2019re getting routine bloodwork to check your levels.",

So far, I am only half way through this bottle, but the taste is much milder and less offensive to me. I didn't give 5 stars because I think it is a hassle to have to take this 2 times per day. I preferred the instructions on Geritol which only directed once per day. Plus this didn't come with a measuring cup to take the recommended 10 oz twice per day. I am using the old Geritol cap to measure out the dosage.",
