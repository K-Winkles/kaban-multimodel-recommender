            "WHAT'S THE IRON FISH? - The Iron Fish is a simple and effective reusable cooking tool that naturally infuses your meals with a gentle dose of iron by transforming water. Shaped like an adorable fish, this iron supplement tool is designed to release iron at the right concentration, providing essential nutrients. It's particularly helpful for individuals with iron deficiency anemia, including pregnant women, menstruating women, vegans, vegetarians, athletes, blood donors, and those with digestive",
            "HOW TO USE THE IRON FISH - Boil 1L of liquid, add the iron fish with a few drops of acidity, wait for 10 minutes, remove the fish, continue cooking with your ingredients, clean, dry, and store in our burlap bag in the refrigerator.",
            "HOW MANY IRON WILL THE IRON FISH RELEASE? - When used as directed, the Iron Fish releases 6-8mg of absorbable iron, roughly 40% of the daily iron requirement for an average person. A diet that includes regular fish consumption can further contribute to meeting one's iron needs.",
            "IS THE IRON FISH SAFE? - The Iron Fish is crafted from natural, bioavailable iron, releasing low iron levels and is generally safe for most individuals. However, we do not recommend its use if you have a hemoglobin variant like Hemochromatosis. The appearance of rust is a normal occurrence, harmless, and easily cleaned. It also confirms that our Iron Fish is made of natural iron.",
            "HOW TO CARE THIS IRON FISH? - To prevent rust, clean and dry your Iron Fish immediately after removing it from the pot. If rust appears, simply scrub it with lemon juice or vinegar to remove it."

I had more energy, and didn't get the 2PM \"sleepies.\" The process is easy. The flavor isn't great but the splash of citrus (read instructions) helps lessen the metallic taste. Be sure to wash the fish well, dry it, put it in a ziplock bag and store it in the fridge to prevent rust. Thanks to the iron fish, I won't have to purchase iron supplements for quite a while.",
