            "TWO REPLACEABLE COVERS - Our ironing board covers are made of 7mm thick felt pad with a cotton cover that more breathable. Each set comes with two covers that can be easily changed as desired. The unique pattern and design are perfect for home decoration.",
            "ALL-IRON FRAME - The iron frame is durable and less likely to bend or warp over time, providing a consistent ironing surface. It is also heat-resistant, allowing it to withstand high temperatures without damage.",
            "SPACE-SAVING - The open ironing board measures 32\" L x 12\" W x 4\" H, while the folding size is 16\"L x 12\" W x 2.8\"H. It is perfect for small spaces and can be stored in a drawer, closet, or luggage.",
            "PRACTICAL DESIGN - The hook at the back allows the ironing board to be hung in the closet, while the fixing fittings keep all parts secure when not in use. The non-slip foot pad prevents the board from sliding during ironing, ensuring safety.",
            "MULTIPLE USES - The countertop ironing board is suitable for sewing or craft rooms, small spaces, or areas with limited storage. It can also be used as a laptop desk or snacks table."
