            "Why Active Iron? Active Iron\u2019s high potency, easy to swallow, iron pills are clinically proven to have 2X better absorption of iron sulfate and 6x less gut irritation. It is a non-constipating, gentle iron supplement kind enough to take on an empty stomach.",
            "Who should take iron supplements? Endurance exercisers & those on restricted diets e.g. vegetarians. Blood donors, women with periods, pregnant & postpartum women. These are easy-to-swallow iron tablets for inadequate iron levels in adult men & women.",
            "How are Active Iron supplements different? Unlike immediate release iron pills that are broken down in the stomach, Active Iron targets the gut\u2019s natural \u2018iron absorber\u2019 site and is released where the iron is better absorbed."
