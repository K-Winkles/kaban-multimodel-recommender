The first iron that I received was used, with water inside the tank and even with some calcium water stains in the spray. I ordered a replacement and the second one was a used one as well with water in the tank and some fingerprints.T-fal makes great products that last many years, but I don't buy their commercial practices of selling your used irons for the price of new ones. I am done with them and I will be switching to another brand.",
