It was one of those we're told about it but don't see it. The chemistry between the leads was good.

                "reviewText": "Lisette Marshall is on my shortlist of go-to authors. Iron is my all-time favorite book featuring the assassin-to-lovers trope. I'm a huge fan of the trope and have devoured more of these than I could ever count. The main characters completely stole my heart. I instantly felt invested in their love story.Tamar, the beautiful Iron Queen always has to be hard and cold and ruthless and in control in order to maintain order. But under that hard exterior is a soft, caring heart and a love for the people her crown serves. Runo, the handsome, mischievous assassin, has a quick smile and a fun-loving spirit, and golden eyes that see more in one glance than they should be able to perceive. He is the first to see through her cold shell. Their romance burns hot quickly. This book has all the sexy steamy moments I've come to expect from a Marshall book.In addition to the blooming romance, strong heroine, and excellent banter, there's a mystery that needs to be solved. Who helped the sexy assassin get into the castle in the first place? Not even Runo knows. I thought I'd read enough Marshall books by now I'd be able to pick up on all the subtle clues, but once again she fooled me. I did not figure it out before the reveal.Have I mentioned yet that I'm completely in love with Runo? I don't care that he's a figment of someone's imagination. There were times while reading when I was so taken by his wit and smiles and inability to take anything (including death) seriously that I was ready to knife-fight Tamar for him :) I received an advanced copy of this book. I highly recommend it for fans of steamy fantasy romance in a medieval setting.",

The tension!It delighted.Megan Whalen Turner wrote it first and this is a spicier adult version, but it has the same longing permeating the prose.Disregarding some elements that I found incongruous & jarring (did the author have a quota to meet on bedroom acts?), the overall book is extremely romantic and delightfully nuanced.I'm almost afraid to move on to book 2 for fear of losing some of the delightful vibes this book leaves you with.",

                "reviewText": "Writing a good fantasy romance trilogy involving the same couple is not easy. While each book needs to have its own entertaining story arc, these arcs need to be interwoven with the three-book long character arcs of the main characters, all while delivering, if not a HEA (happily ever after), at least a HFN (happily for now) ending at the end of each book.Lisette delivers and does so while gifting us with two beautifully broken characters. The assassin, Runo, is everything you expect an assassin to be, yet it is the unexpected about him that makes him instantly likeable. Queen Tamar is the ultimate expression of a character who presents a strong face to the world, while hiding her true self. Their interactions, how they impact each other's growth is a joy to experience.",

Their romance is a bit cliche, but you kind of know what you're getting into when you buy a book about a queen and the assassin sent to kill her. There wasn't anything especially thrilling in the story, but the twist did surprise me, which is always a plus. This is a book where I'd probably read the next in the series eventually, but I'm not so eager that I'll start it right away. I'm happy with the ending as it is",

I loved it !! Especially the fact that Runo doesn\u2019t forget that his an assassin and he\u2019s here to kill the Queen, despite the tension and the moment between the two he never forgets. Tamar is such an interesting character, and the playful side of Runo helps her to relax a little and forgot her Iron attitude. Such complementary characters, it\u2019s awesome.The plot was well-rounded, and I cannot wait to know what will happen next with the Empress. Not always a fan of political drama but it\u2019s so great and not boring \ud83d\ude09So definitely planning to read the rest of the series \ud83d\ude0d",

                "reviewText": "(check out how AWESOME this cover is!)This one was extremely addicting and amazing! The MCs Tamar and Runo were so \u2764\ufe0f\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Tamar is the Queen of Redwood. Her dead husand, the King, was extremely violent and physically abusive.. this story starts a few years after she poisons and kills him.Runo is an assassin in the employ of a rival empire. He visits the kingdom of Redwood on a paid assignment to kill Tamar.But then they meet, and have a deadly game of back and forth, and at each step, they fall for each other more. As new threats emerge and Runo and Tamar become closer and closer, it's only a matter of time before the enemies turn into lovers.\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I loved their banter, their vulnerable conversations, their chemistry, and the ending was just \u2764\ufe0f I really cannot wait for book 2! I'll just keep rereading the book 1 and it's ending till then :)))Also for those of you who have read her previous trilogy? There are a bunch of subtle mentions of Vivi and Jaghar in this book, and it was amazingg \u2764\ufe0f",
