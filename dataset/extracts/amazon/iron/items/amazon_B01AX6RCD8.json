                "reviewText": "Update 2.11.24... worth the 5 stars.This is a great iron. Used it on several items today and I love it. It made my pillowcases look fabulous, so I ironed the sheets too! Got out all wrinkles. Love the shot of steam in addition to the cotton/steam setting. Irons beautifully. I appreciate that this doesn't drip water everywhere. It shuts itself off if left sitting on its heel for afew minutes, but heats right back up quickly. That's a must when I'm sewing things and need to press seams. I can honestly say I enjoy ironing again and when done, the retractable cord is a huge plus. I am using distilled water in my iron, too much calcium in the tap water here, and that will ruin the iron quickly.If you're on the fence with this iron, I recommend it and say get it. You won't be disappointed (and If you are, you can return it).Original review: I had a Shark steam iron but I hated that thing with a passion since day one. I finally gave in and bought this Sunbeam...trusted brand, been around for eons, so why not. It was received with a few very small areas on one side of the sole plate that look like tiny scratches, but they're not rough, not raised, don't catch on anything, etc. so I think it's just something in the metal. So far I've used this once, as a test run. I bought a new ironing board cover at the same time, (which arrived with more wrinkles than a Shar Pei!) so I installed the cover and then ironed it. The iron worked well on that. I also ironed interfacing to a piece of fabric. The sole plate did pick up some of the interfacing residue, but it wiped off really easily with a damp microfibre cloth after the iron had cooled off. Love the retractable cord. Makes storting the iron easier. Instructions say to use tap water, but not sure that's such a good idea with all the junk and calcium in the water here,so I'll be using distilled water in mine. Giving this 5 stars for now.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second of this model I have purchased from Amazon. The first lasted 20 months before it stopped working (heating). I am really, really hard on steam irons, though, and the first one of these lasted longer than a pretty good Rowenta I paid 3x more for. The original Sunbeam quit on a morning of an event I needed to steam-iron something for, so I went to a local store and bought a lesser iron by a different maker for $5 less because I had to have an iron right away. Within a week, it started leaking from the water/steam reservoir. So I ordered this second Sunbean from Amazon and just used the cheap, leaky iron (sans water/steam) until this arrived (and then I returned the other one to the store for a refund). I am extremely happy with the product's steamability, the heft of the iron, the controls and large water tank. I think the reasons the original Sunbeam didn't last were: I never unplugged it (it turns itself off but keeps itself ready and flashes a red \"plugged-in\" light continually), and I used the (great) self-cleaning feature for the water tank only when things got rough (intermittent steam, reduced steam power, minerals seeping out, all of which the self-cleaning remedies). As I said, I abuse irons. For the price and for just what the product is and is supposed to do, this is a great steam iron. I only kind of wish the soleplate were coated with Teflon or something, but again, if I took better care of irons, I'd not get to the point where, with altar linens dipped in starch water and the like, I'd have to use fine steel wool to get the buildup off (again, really not something you're not supposed to do EVER, but in the last three months of the first Sunbeam's life, that's what I did--and once you resort to that, you get a shiny soleplate but the sticking gets worse and worse because you've ruined the finish [even though you can't really tell you have by looking]). I can't say I'll take better care of this one--I get in a hurry, I'm pretty busy, I forget to unplug, I use lots of starch products, etc. But I think 20 months for the price and such horrible abuse is really remarkable. Great steam capacity, great weight in the hand, beautiful ironing.",

And that you may need a cloth between the iron and the garment you\u2019re ironing. Otherwise, it\u2019s a good weight and does a good job getting rid of wrinkles. It gets very hot.",

The steam heat is excellent, bottom plate is non-stick - just make sure to adjust the settings for certain types of fabrics. Quick one pass steam blast ironing too.",
