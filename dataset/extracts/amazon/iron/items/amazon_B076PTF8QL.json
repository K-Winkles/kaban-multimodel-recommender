Dietary Iron is essential, because it binds oxygen to a protein molecule in the blood cells called hemoglobin, to enable the oxygen to move from the lungs to the cells. \u201cTired blood\u201d is a way of describing blood that doesn\u2019t transport oxygen, glucose, and nutrients well, and people who aren\u2019t getting enough blood-building nutrients often lack energy. Iron deficiency may be related to food choices, or the consumption of substances that inhibit Iron\u2019s absorption, such as coffee, tea, soy, and dairy products. Certain medications may interfere with your body\u2019s ability to absorb Iron. Blood Nourish-R nourishes healthy blood-building processes. It is non-constipating and easy to absorb. It revitalizes and energizes. Take two capsules every morning with or without food.",

                "reviewText": "***I recently changed my review, see Bottom for Details***This Product was taken off Amazon for well over a year, and now somehow it's just back like it never even left.I used to buy this all the time for Iron, and I loved it, I DIDNT NEED ANYTHING ELSE! this worked. and then after It was removed from amazon for a while, and after I tried it again it never worked the same way it used to, I Documented and wrote down when I took it, and didn't take it, all it took was 6 days of taking this twice a day and my nails would start growing strong and thick....but since the bottle changed labels, and they were \"recalled\" it stopped working that way and even when I bought it from their site it never worked the same, i've been trying other Iron supplements and they never work the same way either.This supplement used to make my nails grow so strong, that i couldn't bite them easily, they were legit like weapons, and they stayed that way for as long as I took it, no other iron Supplement does or did this for me, and I can't understand why it doesn't work anymore. something is wrong.I think their formula changed, if anyone can find out exactly what changed about the company or the formula it would help tremendously.someone please suggest a lab that can test the Older bottles if any can be found, and the newer bottles. something is off.7-26-23 Edit: I was completely wrong about this product and company, when I made this review I was going through something that I now know was causing my receptors to become blocked, meaning i was simply unable to absorb the Nutrients in the supplements I was taking.I was confused all the time, paranoid, and not able to think or remember things like I could before and can do now, after I did further research to understand what was going on with me, I was able to find things without the help of doctors to Clean myself out of what was causing the Blockage, and now this supplement specifically is working again, I now take 5 in the morning and 5 at night, and I can see the return of my nail growth again, after I only took 1 single round of it to clean myself, I'm not back to 100% with my nutrient absorption, but before when I was getting negative growth and increased anxiety, my nails were not growing at all, they were nearly down to my cuticles......but now I'm seeing really meaningful growth.I used to see and believe that idea of \"everyone's body is different\" and I now think that is a Lie, as I've found people of different races that were going through the same thing, and I'm now helping them to recover like I did, which leads me to believe that people who deal with this, and people who say that they don't get an affect from things are likely not able to absorb nutrients just like I couldn't for the exact same reason.",

                "reviewText": "So I will start this review by specifying that I'm not entirely saying this is negative, hence the star rating. I havent been taking this for very long, but was on a long list of supplements and this pill has several of them and figured I'd get it to reduce the number of pills I take a day. This certainly does that! I haven't really felt too much of a difference in energy and all that since starting to take this instead of the individual supplements but I haven't felt worse either. I wouldnt take that part to heart though because I have issues and the normal stuff doesn't work either.HOWEVER there was one part of this pill that compelled me to leave a review. That part is the absolutely bizarre smell and taste.The pills are in large capsule style pockets that allow for easy swallowing, and thank the stars that they do because any amount of coating or powder that tastes the way that these do would make them unbearable.The closest thing I can possibly compare the smell and taste of these to would be those bacon flavored dog treats. It's not subtle either, if I leave the lid open for longer than I need to, it will waft and fill the 5 foot radius of air. I hold the pill under my tongue and fill my mouth with water, but I still gag from the aura of the taste. Luckily the gel capsule makes it not that strong though. It isn't just me either, I've had other people smell these and they all gag or have an absolute look of bewilderment.If you have a strong aversion to odd smells and tastes: probably don't pick these upIf you would like to cut down multiple pills into one big condensed pill and don't mind one large unpleasant pill: definitely go for it.If you have vitamin deficiencys and love the taste of dog treats: I think god made this just for you!All in all, it does what it needs to and gets the job done! At least I'm assuming it does. I'm not a doctor. I do however have taste buds and a nose, and something bizzare is going on here.UPDATE: I raised it by a star because I just got back some lab results and these pills have raised my Iron levels more than 5 weeks of iron infusions did! I'm in normal range for the first time in my life! They may taste like dog food, but hey they WORK",

                "reviewText": "I've never had a blood test to see if I have an iron deficiency, but I have many of the common symptoms and iron supplements make me feel much better. I had been taking two iron supplements prior to trying Blood Nourish-R. One was a tablet and one was a liquid supplement. Prior to supplementing with iron, I'd experience shortness of breath, light headedness, and worst of all, fatigue. I also try to make a conscious effort to eat iron-rich foods.I still cannot believe the difference this supplement makes in how I feel! I was drawn to it because it uses a clinically studied iron called Albion Ferrochel (ferrous bisglycinate chelate). In researching it, I learned Albion does the stomach\u2019s work in advance by producing low molecular weight mineral compounds in which the minerals are bound to amino acids to produce natural organic chelates that can pass easily through the intestinal wall. Maybe this is why I feel so great!?Inorganic iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate (not used in this blend) have low bio-availability and typically produce undesirable side effects, such as gastric upset and nausea. That's why you see some iron blends labeled as \"gentle iron\" or \"easy on the stomach\". Blood Nourish-R has never caused me to be constipated like some iron supplements do. I've been telling all my female friends and family members about it!",
