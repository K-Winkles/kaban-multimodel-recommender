                "reviewText": "I have now purchased and tried about 6-7 different steamers, in just about every price range and \"this is the one\"...I am keeping! Gosh, this has been a pain in the butt! When I buy some thing, I thoroughly go through the reviews, first, and I have been highly disappointed! One, right after the other, after the other! It shouldn't be that hard to find an awesome steamer, especially with reviews attached to them! Maybe my expectations are too high, for the average person? But honestly? I was quite surprised by 'their' reviews, versus mine! For one thing, I want an easy to fill reservoir, and one that I can steam a few items at a time! I didn't realize, some of the steamers \"require\" distilled water!? Are you kidding me? I don't want to have to keep distilled bottled water on hand, just for that!? And secondly, my eyesight isn't all that! And trying to pour water into a teeny tiny hole? Are you kidding me?? Flimsy, and cheaply made, is what I kept experiencing, not to mention, some didn't work that well at all! In fact, the last one? Was a generic brand, in the same price range as this one, yet it had even BETTER REVIEWS! So naturally, I thought it's gotta be better than the 'name brand' one!Well?!What a joke! It too, was a touchscreen, which made me super hesitant to try this one! Because it took me several, very frustrating minutes, for it to even respond to ANY touch! Yet once it did? It worked beautifully! That was, until, I couldn't get it turn it off! I finally had no other choice, but to pull the plug!!!Hence! Being that it took me going through a minimum of six different steamers?!! I hesitated for over a month to even give it another shot! But boy! Was I ever blown away, with relief...even at FIRST GLANCE! From the box, yep, from the box, to the instrument itself! It's 'SEXY' in and of it self! AND BEST OF ALL...IT \"ACTUALLY WORKS\"...BEAUTIFULLY!!! Thanks to a tried and trustworthy company/name BRAND, that you actually can......TRUST!",

                "reviewText": "One of the things I love about this steamer is its quick heat-up time. It's ready to use in just 30 seconds, which is much faster than some other steamers I've tried. It also has a large water tank that provides plenty of steaming time and allows you to steam pretty much anything.This steamer comes with a few additional features that make it even more versatile. It has a fabric brush that can be used to loosen lint and dirt before steaming, and it also has a lint brush attachment that can be used to remove lint and pet hair from clothes and furniture.Overall ImpressionI highly recommend the Electrolux Portable Handheld Garment and Fabric Steamer. It is a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-use steamer that is perfect for a variety of household tasks.Pros:- Quick heat-up time- Continuous steaming for a long time- Great at getting out wrinkles- Fabric brush and lint brush attachmentsCons:- The water tank could be a bit larger- The steamer can get a bit hot to the touch",

                "reviewText": "Was looking to change over from a traditonal iron since I have a lot of clothing that needs to either be dry cleaned to get wrinkles out since its not iron safe.Did some half done photos as an example, some things I noticed was it definitely takes more than 30 seconds to heat. I say plug it in and let it warm up for 3-5 minutes or if you have really delicate clothes just get started on those. If this is also your first steamer do not expect a white plume of steam coming out, the steam is very fine and you will not be able to see it all the time. This unit did not spurt any water droplets and produced fine hot steam the entire time which was nice to see. Also please use distilled water, if you do not want to deal with weird dark colored spots on your clothing from it spitting out debris build up, use DI water.As for actual usage look up a video on how to use a steamer should only take 2ish minutes per shirt if you are just doing a go over to get out light wrinkles and using it correctly.As for cons there are 2, first is that the head part that heats up to warm the steam gets HOT. As long as your hand never goes above the steam trigger it will be handleable. Second, due to the head getting so hot I dont see this lasting a long time since all parts are plastic on the inside and are due to warp over time. But for the price point I dont mind rebuying every handful of years. Happy steaming!",
