I was a little disappointed that the model I had been buying was gone, so this was the only digital choice. I was apprehensive, but about month in, I am impressed with iron. Good weight to it without being too heavy, you can get some burst steam even at 3- which is what I liked about the old digital- given that so many items are synthetic materials now, but you really need some steam to get the wrinkles out. The new away you add water it so much better and easier than the past model. I\u2019m glad I stuck with B & D and gave this digital model a chance.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a Sunbeam iron a couple years ago to replace my lightweight iron of many years, but have never liked it (clunky, not good with wrinkles). Actually, I wanted to buy THIS iron back then, but it had so many reviews citing unreliability. May still be true!But I do really like this iron! It's not too heavy & is well-designed in term of maneuverability & easy for me to hold too (I'm older.....). And no leaking or spitting or any problems with, so far...I mostly iron duvet covers & sheets, & this iron is greatly superior to the Sunbeam. Can get into small corners of fitted sheets with, and yes, that steam is quite amazing! Fogs up my glasses if I'm lifting it (& not over the ironing board). It feels & looks like a quality iron too.It's a bit hard to read the controls on the iron (but I'm mostly setting it to the same places). And hard to see water level (tho easy to pour water into it). Otherwise, it's well-designed & not overly complicated. I just pray it lasts awhile! Best iron I've had or used--& priced right, good value!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Black & Decker iron because of my previous great experience with the brand. I am pleased with the weight and features. There is a lot of steam, and so far no issues with dripping water. What I\u2019m unhappy with is the fact that the temperature numbers are light grey against a medium/dark grey dial. They are REALLY difficult to see. Especially since the temperature dial is right under the handle, which casts a shadow. My husband made me tiny numbered labels that I attached to the dial so that I could tell which setting I was on. The other thing missing on the iron itself is something indicating what type of fabric each temperature setting is for. There is a small pamphlet that comes with the iron that tells you this, but I don\u2019t want to always be digging it out. Once again, my husband made me a small label with that info that I was able to a fix to the iron so that the info is always available.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this iron. It has a great steam capacity and the buttons for steam are user friendly. The only negative things are maybe that it is a little heavier than I expected and the dial to select the temperature range is underneath the handle, so sometimes I bump it but it isn\u2019t a big deal.It irons very well, glides smoothly, has a good sized water reservoir, heats up fast and I like the automatic shut off when not in use.If you are looking for an iron that irons nice and puts out a lot of steam, this is it. I am very satisfied with this iron.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Rowenta \"pro\" irons for 15 or 20 years. During that time I've had four of them. Because the Rowentas have a poorly designed water tank. Every one of them would develop a leak while the thing was standing on the board, on the heel. The tanks split because the adhesive fails. Because I'm an engineer, I fixed them several times - I found replacement tanks, and then found better adhesive for the tank that failed. I paid as much for a tank as I did for this Black and Decker iron. So I tried this iron instead.Those Rowenta were three times the price of this Black and Decker. The features of this iron are very competitive with my recently-failed Rowenta Pro - identical sole plate size, stainless steel, adjustable steam, nice heft (I prefer a heavier iron), good water capacity, well designed cord strain relief. The Rowenta was 1700 watts. This one is 1600 watts. I just got through my first Shirt Ironing Marathon and the B&D did a super job. Smooth glide, good steam (even on the low setting). The Rowenta has hundreds of steam holes and this has relatively few, but even so this did a great job on my shirts.So now we'll have to see how this one lasts. My last Rowenta is now 5 years old, use it about twice a month, for 12 or 15 shirts at a time. So basically one person.Update Aug 2021This B&D iron is still going strong. No leaks. Works GREAT. Uh Buh Uh Bye Rowenta...I would suggest running through the 'cleaning blast' process occasionally. I have somewhat hard water. I use a filtration / softener gadget to help with that. But still, I have found on two or maybe three occasions over the last 4 years that it would spit white minerals (aka 'scale'). As soon as you see that, it's time to get an old towel, crank the iron to high, and press the button to blast additional water to the sole plate. Iron the towel mercilessly, blasting away with the steam. This will help release the gunk. I was AMAZED at how much gunk came out the last time, and more amazed that more of that gunk didn't end up on my shirts.So Kudos to Black and Decker for a great product at a great price.Update Sept 2022It died this morning. :( . The sole plate does not heat. There are no replacement parts for these, and they used special screws to keep the curious out. But.... HAH! I took it apart anyway. Confirmed that the heater coil is toast.Oh well... I got five good years out of it. Far longer than any of the Rowentas I'd owned. Just ordered another one.",

It steams wonderfully and it is very easy to keep clean due to the stainless steel plate. It glides over the fabric. I like it better than my more expensive irons. It does not leak or spit water. I use this not only for ironing our everyday wear, but for when I make clothing and sewing.",
