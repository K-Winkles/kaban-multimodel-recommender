                "reviewText": "Since my wife is doing a lot of sewing and clothes designing, we needed an iron, but before we purchased different brands from Hobby Lobby, and she wasn't satisfied. Finally, we ordered this iron, which works just perfect. It produces immediate heat, and it's safe for any kimd of fabric. Also, it's very weightless, so she can use it for hours. In addition, the water tang has a decent size and the hose it's long enough. Easy to use and great product.",
