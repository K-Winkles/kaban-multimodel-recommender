The rowenta just didn\u2019t get the heat like the chi does.I sew and need a new iron every couple of years. I bought a Chi last time and loved it.

                "reviewText": "I had an inexpensive old Sunbeam Iron that didn't spray or steam well anymore so I upgraded to this CHI iron. I knew the CHI brand for hair-straighteners but I didn't realize they made clothing irons too!The CHI iron has a retractable cord which is a feature I love (my old iron had one too). I had to read the manual to figure out how to fill it with water. My old iron came with a cup with narrow pour spout. Since this iron came with nothing, I used the one from my old iron to fill this iron. I noticed right away that it holds way more water than my old iron, which is great! I would think it's unnecessary to use distilled water & using tap water is fine. I found it odd that the manual said NOT to use distilled water as if something bad would happen if you did. I can't imagine what's wrong with distilled water because it's just less dissolved ions.Anyway, the iron got hot fast and beeps when the pre-heating is done (about 2 minutes). With an electronic temperature controller you don't have as many temperature options. This gives the iron some simplicity. The iron glides well over the surface. The iron has some automatic off features (1 minute if on face or side, 30 minutes if sitting upright). The iron also has a \"self-clean\" button.I used the maximum steam possible to iron some cotton dresses. These dresses had not been ironed in several years. The iron has far more steam holes than my previous iron. The iron was very efficient at smoothing the fabric. Maybe not one pass, but it was fast. A full tank of water got me through three dresses.",

                "reviewText": "The Chi steam iron was a nice upgrade from my old Shark iron machine it was surprisingly big in size but very ergonomic when it comes to handling it and using it. I loved the design and the sleek look of the Chi a lot.The controls of the temperature and steam are very easy to use and the placement of the fabric modes over the water reservoir opening is very smart and convenient. Loved that the water reservoir opening had a part that prevented water bubbling and spelling outside.The Chi steam iron took a bit longer to heat up but I am assuming it's bigger surface is contributing to this.I Love the retractable cord it does keep the ironing space clean and tidy and prevents accidents but I wish the cord was longer to give more room to move freely.The steam feature is great and helps with stubborn wrinkles, Nothing crazy or powerful but good enough to iron and steam clothes but I don't see it as a standalone steamer nor it's designed to be a steamer.This Chi steam iron is amazing and I love the way it looks and no complaints at all about the temperature. Solid product and highly recommend it.",

Its pointed-end design makes it ideal for use on collars, shirts, and other difficult-to-reach areas. It works well for both regular and specialized wear. Superior to the standard size, the retractable cord and cord length provide additional length. Both for use and storage, there are numerous safety features. Based on which way the iron is pointed, this iron has a built-in self-timer that will automatically turn off after a set amount of time. The smooth glide and the more than 400 steam openings have impressed me. It deserves 4.5\u2b50\ufe0fStars. Hope you find this review helpful.The iron's general feel and weight make it comfortable to use for extended periods. Ironing wrinkled fabrics is made easier by its various mode settings, which include cotton, linen, wool, silk, and synthetic settings.I wholeheartedly endorse this iron, particularly if you're looking to replace your old family iron. It features an extra-long cord, operates quickly and efficiently, and regulates the steam and stream output. Both using and storing it are quite easy. All in all, this iron is excellent.",

It handles the most stubborn wrinkles, those that are extremely hard to get out. With this iron, it's as if they never existed. A fantastic iron with a large water reservoir, digital display, and great performance, the iron sole plate glides easily and has a narrow point that is good for ironing collars, and cuffs, and for pressing seams open when sewing. The iron does get very hot. When ironing cotton you can use the wool setting if you don't want the iron to be too hot. I think it is better to use distilled water. For other irons, I have used tap water and noticed over time that there was mineral build-up that stained materials when I ironed.",
