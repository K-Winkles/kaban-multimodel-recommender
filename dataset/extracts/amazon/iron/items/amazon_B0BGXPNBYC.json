It really warms up fast and, boy, what steam you can get (or you can set the steam lower if you like). One thing I would change which does not affect the ironing operation in any way is the on-off dial. It sits directly beneath the handle, and it is not that easy to see or set the settings. I put a dot of nail polish where the dial indicates 'off' and another dot where the machine says 'off'. That way I can line up the dots and be sure I have shut off the iron fully. I hope the manufacturer can redesign the settings dial or add these kinds of indicators. In any event I would buy this iron again in an instant for its value, functionality and quality.",

Needed one in a pinch and didn't want to spend much, or just get the same brand name boring iron. This is a pretty sweet iron. It has some kind of Tron meets the Transformers design going on, is tough looking and seems well built. Also with the red it's somewhat Ferrari like, I dunno in a past life I was a designer, and this is a cool iron. And if you're a dude it's probably the manliest one out there, if you're looking for manly. It steams very well, honestly irons my clothes better than any other iron I've had so it doesn't just look good, it's fantastic at it's job! Shipped in one day in a very professional looking box. Amazing. 5/5 bro",

                "reviewText": "Out of the Box, this iron was a sure fire winner! So much so that I have purchased a 2nd one for my other house. Recently the 1st one (now 7 months old) has become hesitant to disperse a burst of steam when the button is depressed. The steam button itself now sits 1/2 way depressed and refuses to return to its normal height position. Starting to get frustrating as I iron my jeans or shirts. Will seek alternative if this persists or gets worse. May need to replace soon. Will try something different next time. Outside of the burst-of-steam button not functioning properly or when depressed, the Iron functions nicely. I can still use a spray bottle of water and the hot iron, but there's nothing like having that burst-of-steam when its necessary.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a seamstress so I need a really good iron. I've had a Rowenta for 5 years but it had leakage issues that became unsafe so that's why I shopped around! I've never had an iron with a ceramic soleplate & so when I used this for the first time I was amazed, it literally floats over fabric! The heat disbursement is top notch & it's not really heavy, which is great if you have sore hands like mine! The ONLY criticism, & it's very minor, is the area where you pour the water in, it could be a tad more accessible, but as I say that's really no big deal. Ironing/pressing is going to be a true joy with this iron & I HIGHLY recommend it!!!",
