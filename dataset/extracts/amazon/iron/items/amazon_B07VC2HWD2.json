                "reviewText": "My friend bought this Beauteral iron and she couldn't stop raving about it to everyone. But I hang out with her anyway because she can read a room and she knows just the right moment to talk about ironing. SHe found it intriguing to discover that many people believe it is just not possible to have an iron that DOESN'T DRIP, LEAK, RUST, SPUTTER, or LEAVE MARKS and really, truly GETS HOT. My friend knew she had to act fast and decided to throw an Iron Party. We all had a blast getting hammered and playing Twister and getting all wrinkly and then trying out her new Beauteral on our own clothing (but not while we were still wearing it, of course, ha). Folks, this iron is AMAZING!! It's really easy to use and it's very efficient, it gets HOTT, and nope! IT DOES NOT LEAK. It really is the iron of everyone's dreams. At some point that night, the ironing pile got so huge it nearly toppled over but we just kept on stripping and ironing, stopping and ironing. Later someone brought a can of spray starch (am I even allowed to say that?) and things got real interesting ... but that iron, man, was unstoppable. The next day I ordered a Beauteral for myself (love it) plus a few more as gifts for my lucky friends. Yesss give it a go --- you won't be disappointed.",

The steam function is as good as the expensive irons I used working as a photo stylist at a national catalog company (I ironed a lot!) It glides over fabric so well and I love the auto shut off function. For the reviewers who said it had water residue in it, it comes with a paper insert that said it was tested in the factory and may have some condensation. I did find the dial a bit hard to adjust at first but just needed to add a little extra pressure, after I did that it was no problem to adjust.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this iron after trying out four different steamers. I chose this one after looking into reviews on similar products. I purchased this one because (1) its price and discount at the time, (2) it had the highest ratings and (3) generally better reviews. The price was a major plus, and so far I haven't regretted that choice. It is a good iron. It is 1500W (so not the hottest it could be, but more than your standard iron you might pick up at the store).This iron is great for the casual user. You can set the temperature to the certain fabric you are ironing. It removed wrinkles from a pair of linen pants and a very very wrinkly dress shirt. The cord is long enough, but not the longest it could be. The weight is manageable for probably anyone. I will continue to use this iron until it gives me a reason to return or replace it. It has performed better than the steamers I used (Conair, Rowenta).Some things that set this iron apart:- it has both iron and steam functions (that can be used independently, or together).- it is affordable- it has an auto shut off feature that beeps loudly enough to hear from another room (this has already come in handy)- it heats up very quickly- it has an auto cleaning function- it comes with a thing to fill up the iron with water- it has an auto cleaning function (I tried this -- it's okay...not sure how useful this will be yet)- it advertises that it is designed for tap water--if this actually works after long-term use without generating calcium deposits, then this might be worth getting for that reason alone.Steaming:It has a steam function and a steam burst function. These are a bit confusing to use, and the instruction manual seems to contradict: it says steam can only be used at a certain temp., but there is a steam icon that is only on certain fabric temps (cotton, linen). So I am not sure if the steam and steam burst can be used effectively when the iron is set to a lower temp. for other kinds of fabrics that are synthetic or more gentle.Good to Know:- the device is tested and it has a warning that that is the reason there may be water drops in the iron when you receive it. One steamer I got had water drops in it (also no protective package or instructions), and looked as if it came used. The unit comes well packaged, so this makes me think they are in fact testing it this way and not just reselling used units. Not sure though.",
