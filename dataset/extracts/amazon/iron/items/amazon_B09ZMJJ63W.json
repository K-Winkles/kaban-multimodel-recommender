                "reviewText": "The Sunbeam is a good iron that is well build. The water capacity is high and the translucent blue allows you to see the level. The dial is behind the holder and is a little awkward to dial the temperature but it is not a deal breaker. The steam shoots out well and is consistent. The unit does shut off automatically when it sits for awhile. I also like the retractable cord. HINT: Don't let the cord fly in by itself but rather guide the cord in. I can see where the retractable cord feature could fail or the cord can get tangled up if you just release the catch and allow it to retract too quickly.The surface is smooth and ironing shirts is done easily in the way the iron surface itself is designed. Overall, this is a very good iron and I hope it will last a long time.",

It is on the heavy side if that bothers you, the retractable cord doesn't slide in all the way (about 6 inches hanging out on the old and new iron), and there is a little bit of droplets from the steam. And the silver on this new model looks like it might eventually peal. But I don't care because I know this one will never break/stop working. I tried another brand and the buttons got stuck on the first try. No thanks.",
