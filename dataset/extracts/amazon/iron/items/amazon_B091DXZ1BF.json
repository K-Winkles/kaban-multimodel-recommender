Not every time I do laundry, but I iron certain items every time they\u2019re washed and I\u2019ve always hated the cord messing up my work. This iron solves the problem beautifully. The only disadvantage I\u2019ve found is that it cools more quickly than a corded iron and you have place it back on it\u2019s pedestal every time, but it heats up just as quickly so it\u2019s not annoying. It\u2019s lightweight and smooth. Just about perfect for me. I even bought one for my sister!",

But where you iron while it\u2019s hot it works perfectly. No cord attached to the iron so very versatile. Weight is sufficient not to heavy.",

                "reviewText": "If I could leave 0 stars I would. First off the whole minute worth of ironing and 25 sec charge Time..... not only is that asinine but inaccurate. More like 20 secs of heat and 30 secs charge. Leakproof ? Not on your life kid. Leaks everywhere. Great concept but horrible execution. Glad I didn't throw away the iron it was \"replacing\" that one been running strong for almost 8 years just hated the cord ..... after this garbage I have a new found appreciation for that minor inconvenience",

                "reviewText": "When the R&D dept made this product, did they think it was a good idea to make a wireless iron that didn't hold a charge, or a charging platform that hardly charged anything, then go and mislead the consumers?I used it the other day to iron a couple of work shirts out to beta test it. I left it on the charger a few days prior for a few hours. I came home and the charging platform was still blue. I thought, will maybe it had a low charge to begin with. I took it off the charging port and looked for the on button...there was no on button. I put it back on the charger and then saw the green on symbol, i thought maybe it was touch screen \"on\" button...So I started ironing and then after about a minute of doing the back of the shirt and then the sleeve it started losing heat and it wasn't steaming anything after two presses from the steam button. So I put it back on the charging port and moved the shirt around, it began getting hot, and then it sank in...This iron goes off the charger in order to get hot. I thought, well this is stupid, and then remembered I should of read the reviews. I'll probably end up getting a wired iron later.",
