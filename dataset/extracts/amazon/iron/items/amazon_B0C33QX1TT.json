This is crucial because the water needs to reach a certain temperature to convert into steam. If the steam button is pressed prematurely, the water might not have reached the appropriate temperature, resulting in high-pressure release of unatomized water, which is the primary cause of most leaks.Avoid Inverting the Product: During use, please refrain from completely turning the product upside down. After usage, ensure to pour out any excess water from the water tank to prevent water leakage through the water inlet when storing the product upside down.This product is designed for use with a 110V voltage standard. When traveling to countries with different voltage environments, make sure to bring a voltage converter to ensure a seamless user experience.",

I was looking for something small so it wouldn't take up much space in my suitcase but easy to use so that I might actually use it. This is perfect. It took a little bit to figure out the best way to steam the first shirt I tried but quickly got the hang of it (used it inside the shirt instead of outside). There is not temperature control and it did spit a little water intermittently but overall happy with the product.",

                "reviewText": "This is an effective portable steam iron. It gets rid of all the wrinkles on my shirts so I take it with me wherever I go. I recently took it with me on a trip to Japan. They have 100 volt outlets and this iron is compatible. One thing I noticed is that the iron will not turn off the heat until it is actually unplugged. The button is merely to activate/deactivate the steam feature. Also, it is extremely hot after unplugging and a person can burn themself easily if they are not careful. To cool it off fast, I soak a washcloth in cold water and then press the iron\u2019s hot metal surface onto the washcloth. This makes the process much faster to cool it down completely.",

Makes a big difference for someone like me who never has time in the morning to steam clothes before work.. I love that you can rotate the handle. I also tried both vertical and horizontal steaming and this works amazingly for both. The steamer is sturdy and well built. Doesn\u2019t spit water. My clothes after steaming doesn\u2019t feel damp or wet like what some steamers do. Lightweight and small enough to pack for travelingI tried many different small steamers and this beats even the expensive ones I was looking for something small because I didn\u2019t want anything that would take too much space and just needed something for quick steaming.Can\u2019t see how much water is left though but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019ll hear if it\u2019s run out of water and you just refill it. You don\u2019t lose any time since it heats up quick.Has a little pad that\u2019s also sturdy where you rest it when you\u2019re fussing with your garment. Still I turn it off every time I put it down on the pad but again, that\u2019s no big deal since it heats back up right away soon as you press the buttonThe cord is short but not short enough to be annoying or make it non functional",
