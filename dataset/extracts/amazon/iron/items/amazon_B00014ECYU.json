                "reviewText": "Definitely a great way to get iron as well as B12 vitamins! There is a bit of an aftertaste if you let it sit on your tongue too long and the pills are about 1.5cm long and 0.5cm wide, so be aware they can be harder to swallow for some people, but they are super easy to break into two halves if need be for ease of swallowing. Seem to work great and like that they derive their vitamins from foods. Gentle on your stomach as well! Will be buying again!",

                "reviewText": "Short version: I was able to go from 'rejected' to 'accepted' - at the local blood bank (able to donate healthy blood again!).Longer version: To clarify, I am 60+ YO, above average health, active compared to others in my age range, and had an accident requiring a couple hours of surgery earlier in the year. After recovery, on my next planned blood donation appointment, I was found to be iron deficient and 'REJECTED' from being able to donate blood at that time. I've since learned a lot about how the combination of aging (no matter how healthy), routine blood donations and blood loss during surgeries can affect the bodies ability to rebuild blood.The ONLY change I made to my diet was the addition of this supplement ... after ~10 weeks, and going in for my next planned donation ... I showed a marked improvement in my blood iron content, allowing me to begin donating blood again. I was 'ACCEPTED'.Obviously, as I'm tested at each blood donation, I will continue to monitor to see if there's any other health-related changes I need to make.In closing, I'm incredibly grateful for this supplement - helping improve my overall health, which allows me to contribute to the blood donation needs of my local community (it's important to me).Thank you!",
