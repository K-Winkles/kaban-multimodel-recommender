                "reviewText": "This iron is nice because it heats up quickly and packs a lot of heating power into a small package! It\u2019s space-saving, works great, and easy to use for travel and at home. I like that it lays down flat in my suitcase or a cabinet for easy travel and storage, too!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This little travel iron is lightweight and compact, but does the job so well! Comes with a little mist bottle and a nice quality canvas bag. I used it to iron a linen shirt on the highest setting and it was perfect. Cord is 4.5\" long, the non-stick plate is 5\" long. Honestly this would make an awesome gift!",
