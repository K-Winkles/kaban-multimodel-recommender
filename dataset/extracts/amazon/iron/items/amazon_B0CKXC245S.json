It's quite big, the length and width are suitable. The size of the ironing pants is big enough. It's very good. It's much more convenient to iron clothes. I used to use a vertical garment iron to iron shirts and they were always uneven. Now I use a steam iron on the ironing board. Ironing shirts is a cure for obsessive-compulsive disorder.The only drawback is that the wall thickness of the pipe is a bit thin, but it should be no problem for home use.",

My new ironing board is more compact and it\u2019s lightweight so I can move it easily. I love that it has thick padding and the top layer is heat resistant. It also has an iron rest that protects the iron from scratches. The iron rest also doubles as a hanger for the board. This ironing board is very sturdy and well-made and is adjustable to 7 different heights. But it\u2019s compact size is what I really needed most.",
