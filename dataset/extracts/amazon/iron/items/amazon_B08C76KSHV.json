                "reviewText": "This is a solid iron. I haven't used a heavy iron since I used my mom's iron. The color is a nice touch. I like the design. I saw good and bad reviews, so I decided to review the instructions all the way through just to make sure I won't miss anything. They recommend doing a Self Clean once a month to clear out build up. To use iron first time on a towel or something durable. Before adding water make sure it's not on, unplugged. And a bunch of other common sense instructions. I like the extra long cord. The base when upright, is a nice rubber base so it won't slide off a hard surface. They give you a measuring cup for the water, I like that. There is a dial with 3 settings, Self Clean, steam and no steam. Steam only works on 2 highest temp settings. The water door is plastic, same as the top of the iron. The water cup has a nice spout for pouring. I can see without the cup it would be easy to overfill, so I appreciate the water cup. When you plug it in, the red light comes on and blinks on the mode button. Temperature settings are easy, push mode button to go up in settings, nylon, silk, wool, cotton & linen. Directions say if you're not sure, start with lowest setting and try that first. I tested on a cotton towel first as recommended. Then onto to a satin tank. So I switched temps from cotton down to nylon, as I had no idea what satin is. Takes awhile for the iron to cool down to a lower temp, but I was able to tell it was too low of a setting. The wrinkes didn't come out, so I went up to Silk Temperature, which worked nicely. The temp setting will blink until ready also. I really like the soul plate, I sew alot, and like the tip of the iron with the weight, before I had to add weight when ironing because it was a light iron. This will be so much easier. I like the water spray button it casts a nice light even spray for a good amount of time. Very light mist. The steam button gives a nice blast, it only works when you are on the highest 2 settings, linen and cotton. And, you need to pause 2 seconds between pushing it. The handle has a comfortable fit. And it seems when not in use the cup fits in the handle nicely. I feel the features are good on this iron. Not my first iron, I've only used light weight cheap irons before. This is well made. I recommend it. Will update my review if anything changes.",

My Rowenta needed a repair/replacement part and I needed something to fill the gap.This is a midrange price iron but it has some great features and it works well.I really like that the cord is so long. If I want to plug it in to iron on my tabletop board really quick in the bathroom, there is plenty of cord to do so, without the added danger or inconvenience of an extension cord.The display is LED, not a dial, so it\u2019s very easy to see what\u2019s what. It\u2019s also very clear when the iron is on and ready to go. There is also an automatic shut off so there is no need to worry. When you come back and pick up the iron it awakens and heats up fast.The water well is easy to fill and takes tap water. It holds quite a bit too.The iron isn\u2019t very heavy, but it gets the job done.It isn\u2019t continuous steam, but it does give out a nice burst of steam with the button. I will be using this as a backup iron in my closet/bathroom for touch ups and quick iron sessions. Or when I just want that cute pop of color!",

                "reviewText": "I have had this iron for two years. It heats quickly and steams well but has a maddening design flaw. The temperature adjustment is a button built into the center of the hand grip. It is damnably difficult to use the iron without inadvertently toggling through the temperature settings until you find the iron is sticking to the fabric because it is too hot or sputtering because it has been turned off. Did no one at Singer ever use this iron?I've tolerated this for two years but recently I found the iron sitting upright in a puddle of water. Investigation revealed that water now trickles out of the iron, some seal having failed. The iron has been lightly used, never dropped, and never mishandled (see photos). I wrote Singer for product support. They replied that it wasa. out of warranty, andb. was not supposed to be stored with water in the tank.Except I never have drained an iron before I stored it in the 60 years I've used one. This is the first iron for me that has failed in this manner.Singer could have and should have replaced this iron. More and more companies that deal through Amazon understand that an \"it's on us\" response builds customer loyalty and benefits them in the long-run. Good job Singer, for saving yourself the cost of an iron.",

I tested it on some fabric that has been folded for years and it was a breeze. Only small drawback is the on off switch is on the handle and I turned it off accidentally, but not enough of a drawback to alter rating. I purchased this on sale but would have paid full price.",

The T-fal iron had offered me durilium glide, non-scratch, non-stick resistance features that I needed, so I thought to be buying another T-fal iron... BUTThis Singer SteamCraft Plus Iron always intrigued me. Below is what I look for in an iron, though not always in this order.- Aesthetic, I'd like it to not look bad.- Cord length, has to be long.- Weight, can't be too heavy (I'm not a bodybuilder!)- Performance help, quality of life features that make it easy to work with.The Singer SteamCraft Plus Iron answered all those needs, and more!- Pretty to look at, minty green, simple clean design.- Extra long cord, at 12 feet.- Weight I can handle, only 3.30 pounds.And for the quality of life features:- The water level can be seen.- Visually see and operate settings fast, no wondering what does what, or pausing looking for a button.- 30 minute auto shut off, self explanatory.- Long pointy reaching tip, full heat gets applied to hard to reach areas.- Old school stainless steel sole plate.- Lots of steam holes, for lots of steam.- Rubber grip on the resting bottom of the iron, so it won't budge/slip.Overall, a very thoughtful, thoughtful iron.Happily Impressed!",
