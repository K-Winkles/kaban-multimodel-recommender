Taking certain prescription medications can also cause mineral deficiencies. Because the mineral content of fruits and vegetables depends on the soil health a crop it is grown in, even a healthy individual who maintains a good diet can be at risk for a mineral deficiency because of mineral-depleted soils. By their very nature, minerals are not particularly well-absorbed by the human body. In addition, various dietary, lifestyle, and health factors can have a negative impact on mineral absorption. One of the barriers to mineral absorption is overcoming the natural form the mineral comes in. Thorne\u2019s mineral ingredients are primarily in their chelated form \u2013 the mineral is linked to an amino acid or an organic acid via a molecular reaction that provides a predictable, high quality, and hypoallergenic chelate. Thorne\u2019s mineral supplements are designed for optimal absorption.",

Thorne cares deeply about where our ingredients come from. We partner only with suppliers whose practices emphasize quality, science, and responsibility. Better ingredients means better potency, absorption, and digestibility - and ultimately better health. Manufacturing the Right Way We manufacture our own products to ensure full supply chain transparency. For more than 30 years, we have invested in clean manufacturing practices. We refuse to use ingredients that can inhibit absorption. We perform our final production in the United States. Our Charleston, SC facility is third-party certified. Four Rounds of Testing We perform four rounds of testing for each product we manufacture \u2013 far above the industry standard. Thorne has invested in two state-of-the-art in-house laboratories that enable us to conduct four rounds of testing, including raw material testing, in-process batch testing, finished product testing, and expiration date stability testing for each lot of product that we manufacture. Thinking Sustainably We're thinking sustainably to protect our environment. We believe the environment should never be compromised for the sake of business gain. At Thorne, we believe that doing our part to protect the environment and its most valuable resources goes hand in hand with our product quality standards.",

I wouldalways stop taking the iron supplement due to side effects and then my iron levels would plummet. When I went for my checkup 6 mos ago, my iron and ferritin were very low. My checkup today showed that all of my numbers have completely recovered with the daily use of Ferrasorb. This iron supplement is so much gentler on the stomach than any other I have taken. I can\u2019t believe that it has worked so well, with no side effects!",
