                "reviewText": "I really hesitated before spending the money for this iron. WHAT?? 200.00 for an iron? I\u2019ve had a black and decker iron retractable cord iron. While it was very light in weight , it just didn\u2019t quite suit my needs. I finally decided to purchase this one and it has been a joy already. Although I have only had it for a few days I have already used it for about 12 hours in my quilting. This iron is a little bit heavier than most irons but I really don\u2019t need to pick it up that often when doing quilting. I love how it has exact fabric choice settings on the dial at the top I adore that it also has multiple settings for the type of steam that you want , the cord is exceptionally long I believe it\u2019s 12 foot and it\u2019s never gotten in my way when quilting . With the rotating cord base, it has never gotten in my way like my previous irons.The water reservoir is easy to fill with water either from the tap or from a water bottle or using the measuring cup that comes with it. I am also impressed with the safety of this iron in that it will auto shut off after 30 minutes in the down position or upright position. If it falls, it will shut off in 30 seconds. The iTouch feature is wonderful. It took me a minute or 2 to get used to the lifting feature but now it\u2019s like second nature. This iron is well worth the money and is a dream to use.UPDATE: it\u2019s now 3 months of using this iron almost everyday and I\u2019ve got to say- I\u2019m happier with it now than when when I wrote the original review! I appreciate the lights on the iron that can tell me at a glance if it\u2019s on/ off or if it in auto off.",

The iron is hot, so even raised up on the feet, the ironing board underneath the iron gets very hot - so hot it doesn't seem safe. Tipping up it's not as stable as other irons, but am not comfortable with the amount of heat directed at the ironing board so am tipping it up just like any other iron.The feet are sometimes a little slow to retract so have found that occasionally while I'm intending to iron, the feet are still down and catch the fabric that I'm ironing. As mentioned, it would be nice if I could turn the auto lift off. Sounds like that was an option in previous models.The side feature is nice for filling it with water, on the flip side, it's very difficult to get all of the water out.",

I love the weight of the iron, the ease of use, the fact that II is ready to use as soon as I put my hand on the handle, and that I do not have to sit it up when not in use. I also love that the cord is a swivel which helps with maneuvering the iron in all possible ways. It is a sturdily built iron with a good weight. It is also a classy addition to my sewing room with the beautiful teal color. It is well worth the money I spent for it. I am very pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "2nd update- after two months of almost daily use... I still feel like a three star rating is appropriate for this item. I do like the auto lift feature however I work on large pieces of fabric and quilt blocks. I struggle with space on my 18inch wide ironing board for this iron to sit and auto lift. The auto lift feature is nice for smaller blocks.The steam functionality is ok. There aren't many holes for the steam to come out on the plate. My Rowenta's plate has hundreds of steam holes. This iron has 1/10th the holes and they are only located on the middle. The steam burst and spray buttons are awful. They are located on the top of the handle... which if you stop holding, activates the auto lift. It's just uncomfortable for my thumb/wrist. I have conceded to keeping a separate spray bottle pn my ironing board. The water tank seems small... or at least I seem to run out of water fairly quickly. I still feel like this iron is too light weight.I did use this to iron a shirt and it worked ok. It's an iron.My final thoughts for now on this are: if you work on large pieces of fabric or fabric that firmly holds wrinkles, this might not be the best solution for you. If you work on blocks with lots of piecing, this speeds up the process with the auto lift. If you like a colorful iron... this iron will work for you.I'm going to keep my electro-shock iron and the Oliso. They seem to both have what the other doesn't. My opinion remains unchanged... the price point for this product is based on its novelty rather than its functionality.1st update- after two weeks of me forcing myself to use this iron\u2026 my rage response has dissipated slightly:I am a quilter so I picked this iron because I needed a longer time before my iron would auto off. For the most part, this iron has done this for me.The auto lift has proved itself useful but I had to convince myself it wasn\u2019t going to burn my ironing pad. I did decide to use distilled water. Spitting hasn\u2019t been prevalent. With that said, I did notice some water staining and subsequent browning of my ironing board cover. It is minimal but it was a new cover and is a visual annoyance for me.The steam function is still substandard compared to my Rowenta. The rating might have been better if the iron was at a better price point.******Original Review:This iron feels like a cheap toy. I am super disappointed. I wanted to treat myself and replace a 15 yr old Rowenta that seems to be leaking from the bottom. At this point\u2026 I feel like risking electrocution over using the Oliso. The auto lift seems pointless after testing it out. I hate how light it feels. The steam burst button is chintzy. If you want to stand it up\u2026 it\u2019s wobbly because of the \u201cfeet\u201d. I have hard water so I use distilled water. I now have to mix distilled water and tap water together to avoid issues. Can\u2019t just use distilled (which I prefer). I can\u2019t believe this is what 200$ gets you now. I miss the early 2000s\u2026I\u2019m going to continue to use it because returning stuff isn\u2019t my forte. I\u2019ll update this review if my rage response improves with use.",

The 1800 watt power provides a fast and efficient ironing experience, making even the toughest wrinkles disappear in no time.What sets this iron apart from others is the Auto Lift feature which raises the iron off the surface when not in use, preventing scorching and providing a safer experience. The steam controls are intuitive and easy to use, and the adjustable steam output allows me to customize the amount of steam to suit my needs.The iron heats up quickly and the temperature is consistent throughout use, providing professional-level results every time. The soleplate glides smoothly over my clothes, preventing any snagging or pulling, and the built-in water tank ensures that I never run out of steam in the middle of ironing.Overall, I highly recommend the Oliso TG1600 Pro Plus SmartIron to anyone looking for a top-of-the-line ironing experience. With its powerful performance, innovative design, and user-friendly features, it's a 5-star product that truly delivers.",

The last one I purchased was 10 years ago at Costco roadshow.The foot sensor feature is useful. Makes ironing easier especially for ironing for quilt piecing and other sewing projects. One tip...the raised feet prevent burning but over time the the ironing board cover will scorch just because there still is heat building underneath even though not in direct contact . The fabric can't help but scorch because hot iron still sits over samd spot when not in use. I put a silicone iron mat to protect the ironing board cover. Still better than tilting your iron after each pressing.",

                "reviewText": "This iron is a joy to use. I got the pink version and it\u2019s just the prettiest iron ever. The lifter feet are amazing and didn\u2019t take very long to get used to (leaving it in the horizontal position). It gets very hot and is a nice weight.I am keeping this as a dry iron to make it hopefully last longer. Just keep a spray bottle of water nearby if steam is needed. The cord is looong which is great. I haven\u2019t noticed any scorching of my ironing board from the iron being lifted, but I recommend turning the iron off if you will not be using it for awhile, just to be safe. It heats back up again fairly quickly so you\u2019re not waiting too long.The sole plate is very smooth and glides nicely. I haven\u2019t noticed any build up yet so I can\u2019t say how easy it will be to clean. Perhaps the tip could be a bit pointier, as it is only rounded, but it still works to open seams flat. It is a large iron, so it\u2019s great for pressing yardage and long seams. I also have the mini version, which is better for the inside of bags and smaller projects.Obviously, you need to keep your hand on the handle otherwise it will lift up. There is no option to turn off the auto lift (a feature that was on previous versions). This means that if you want to leave the iron in one spot for a really good press you can\u2019t remove your hand like on a regular iron. That\u2019s a bit annoying, but I\u2019ll get used to it.There is a silicone sole protector available, but it\u2019s sold separately, which is kind of lame for such an expensive iron. I will probably purchase it in the future just to have and to protect the sole plate should it somehow get knocked off the ironing board.I love that this iron is available on Amazon for a pretty good price and is Prime shipped. The cost to buy from Oliso in the US is astronomical, especially once taxes and shipping are added. If you\u2019ve been on the fence about this iron, I\u2019d say go for it!",
