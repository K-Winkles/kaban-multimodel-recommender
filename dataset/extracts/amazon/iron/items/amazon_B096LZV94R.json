Good size for small jobs. I use it for quilting, and it does an excellent job of pressing seamsthe size is 6 inches by 2.5 inches, so you are only ironing the parts you need to iron, like seamsConsThe cord is only 45 inches long, making it difficult for me to work on an ironing board.I had to add an extension cord to use only on my ironing board.You must press harder to get a very flat seam and hold it there for a few seconds.The cord comes out at an odd angle, so you must be careful when putting it down that it will continue to stand.",
