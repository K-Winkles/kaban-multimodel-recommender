It's so important for women to maintain healthy iron levels during these times!They are super easy to swallow, they aren't too big, and they have no taste.They do not cause constipation or changes in bowel habits.I can get them on my subscribe-and-save, so I don't have to worry about remembering to re-order.Cons:Some people prefer to buy in bulk, like bottles in a 60 or 90 count. These only come in a 30-day supply, so you have to purchase monthly unless you add to subscribe-and-save (which is what I do).Pro-tip:Take iron with vitamin C (pill or a glass of orange juice) to increase absorption.",
