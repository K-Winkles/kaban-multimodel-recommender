So far so good\u2026no complaints. I\u2019ve only been for about 4 days so it\u2019s kind of early to say how effective they are. Will come back to updateUPDATE: I added liposomal lactoferrin to my supplement routine, partly because it is very effective with iron absorption. I noticed that when I took this with lactoferrin in the morning, I was stricken with fatigue and Diarrhea (sorry for the TMI). Liposomal Lactoferrin absorbs iron and with this iron supplement being a higher dosage, I think it was a bit too much for my stomach to handle.So I now take the lactoferrin in the morning and the iron at night. I\u2019ve since had no issues.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these because I bought vitamins and they didn\u2019t have iron. I have a bad gag reflex, so swallowing pills can be a bit of a chore. I bought two bottles and am looking to give them away. They are so sickeningly sweet and I just can\u2019t handle chewing them (sadly, a common occurrence with many chews and gummies), since they are inedible to me, I don\u2019t know if they are effective or not.Based on the positive reviews, I\u2019d say give them a shot only if you have a sweet tooth and a high tolerance for sweetness.",
