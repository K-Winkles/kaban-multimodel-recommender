                "reviewText": "I always passed on taking an iron supplement until I purchased these. There is no burping, or constipation like in the old days and I noticed a definite improvement in my fatigue. Through the years (I am 75) my iron levels have been tested regularly as they are a regular component of a CBC which is very simplistic. I always tested at a low normal, usually with just one number or two over the line. So, the docs said I was within normal limits... Then, one day I chose to eat a can of beets for breakfast (I know, I\u2019m weird) and noticed an hour or so later that my urine was very pink in color. Because I am curious by nature I googled \u201cwhy do eating beets make my pee pink? I was surprised to see an article that stated that this phenomena was present in 10 to 14% of the population and had to do with the lack of a particular enzyme that metabolized the beets. More importantly, this pointed to an iron deficiency in that person. In a way, I was mightily ticked off that all these years of continual drowsiness and fatigue could have been alleviated by a physician saying, \u201chmm, you\u2019re showing a low normal in hemoglobin, so let\u2019s try an iron supplement\u201d.. (BTW, this bit of beet juice info was just a small little tidbit posted by an unknown source. My daughter said \u201cMom, you can\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet!!\u201d Well, a month or so later, there was a full, scientific article on \u201cBeeturia\u201d which stated exactly what I\u2019d seen earlier.I guess what all this points to is need for us to be pro-active in our health care. I wish that I had spoken up for myself years ago!! Now, going back to this iron supplement, I have not had any unpleasant side effects. It needs to be said that you have to be careful with all supplements and not overdo any of them. There are those of us that think \u201cif a little bit is good, a lot will be better\u201d. Ok, this has nothing to do with the subject of iron supplements but I feel compelled to mention it.. There\u2019s a lot of info regarding the health benefits of apple cider vinegar and I\u2019m right up there with the believers! However, I have only seen on ONE YouTube presentation a warning that too much ACV lowers your potassium levels. I am a semi-retired hospice nurse (private duty) and was working a difficult case in San Jose\u2019 a few years ago. I was not accustomed to the summer temperatures in that area and was drinking extra large cups of water with lime, honey and ACV. I thought I was doing my body a service until I slid out of bed one night and literally could not get up off the floor. I\u2019m embarrassed to disclose how long and hard I TRIED, and had large abrasions on my elbows and knees. I had my first ride in an ambulance and blood tests revealed that my potassium level was dangerously low. Being a nurse, I did not suspect this as there was no muscle cramping or irregular heartbeat involved. After two infusions of potassium I was able to walk across the floor. Unbelievable!! I realized this is long-winded, but if the knowledge helps even one person, it should be worth it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This, about Anemia and the New Chapter Iron Complex",
                "reviewText": "Hi. I have severe, chronic iron deficiency anemia. Out of any oral supplementation, this is the only one I can take (swallow with orange juice for best absorption.) Any prescription or over the counter supplementation will likely do a major number on your stomach and GI tract. Therefore, this iron supplement is great because it has a proprietary blend of ingredients to protect the stomach--I literally can take this with no food at all, it is that gentle. I take this, plus a multivitamin to combat my exhaustive fatigue and the B12 levels here are a tremendous support. Recently, I realized by bottle ran dry and it has been several days since I have taken my iron complex, and I feel the difference. I cannot even wake up on my own, and I'm sleeping 10 hours plus. When it arrives tomorrow, you can be sure I will be back to my old iron maintenance protocol. NOTE: For those who have terrible anemia and haven't noticed major changes, you may need something beyond an iron supplement. Years ago, my doctor made a referral to a hematologist and if your primary doc has yet to do so, and you are seriously anemic, ask. Or, force them to do it. Or go to a hematologist on your own. I was so sick with anemia (this was years before I took this supplement) that after a blood draw, my hematologist's first words to me were, 'I'm surprised you were able to get through the front door without collapsing.' From there, I had intravenous iron supplementation. When your RBC's and Hemaglobin and Ferritin (make SURE your doc runs a Ferritin test) are significantly low, there is a point that no oral supplementation can fix the problem, and it can be deadly. From the comments, there are many anemic folks in response, and I can't emphasize enough that this supplement is great, but your problem may be well beyond what any of the strongest supplements can do. If the problem is persistent like mine, find a hematologist. Once you get your iron up, you can take maintenance doses of this plus a multivitamin, but for some, anemia is a malabsorption issue and no amount of oral supplement will get you to a therapeutic dose. See a hematologist, watch your bloodwork and make sure your primary care doc runs a Ferritin test, get your B12 tested and find a hematologist. No one should have to live this way, and out of all the docs I've seen in my life, one at least realized I was on the brink of death and got me to see experts. If needed, I get the iron infusions, but this New Chapter Iron Complete is part of my health regimen, consistently. It is filled with other nutritional must-haves, and when I don't take it, I feel like the walking dead. This is one part of tackling anemia--daily maintenance, but you have to see a hematologist as well. They can also help determine why you're anemic. Many doctors like to treat anemia like it is normal for women, and no. It is not normal, nor is it okay, to remain sick with something that can leave you wandering around, chewing ice and being cognitively impaired. Severe enough, it can kill you. Trust. Be well, all.",

                "reviewText": "With this 2nd pregnancy, I developed restless leg symptoms. My Dr. suggested walking at least 30 minutes in the afternoon, stretching before bed, and increasing my iron. I have had success with New Chapter's raw food prenatal when the iron in all other prenatal supplements made me sick so I decided to try their iron food complex. They have worked fairly well but I do get heartburn from them. I've reduced that by taking it at night instead of during the day and noticed a marked decrease in heartburn from them. My restless leg symptoms have almost completely disappeared but I am following my Dr's advice in walking and stretching. That said, the symptoms come back if I forget a dose of the iron so I would say that is the biggest influence.",
