Only using distilled waster. Ironed 3 shirts today. I am pleased with the performance of this iron. Especially the narrow pointed tip. That feature works really well with just a slight tip forward. I also see no difference in how the ceramic coated iron glides compared to my old stainless steel iron. Perhaps it's only noticeable to a daily ironer. No fears of being too hot and burning clothes as reported by many Rowenta reviews. No leaks or drips. Never used the Heavy Steam setting. The printed settings around the dial are difficult for me to see but that's kind of self explanatory.",

It looked to me like it had been opened previously and repacked rather sloppily with the water cup just loose in the box. The sole plate cover had been removed. That said I have tried the iron and it seems to work well. I hope it this iron was someone\u2019s returned purchase that it was not returned due to a performance problem. I guess time and use will tell.",
