The sole plate is metal not ceramic which I prefer. It produces a fair amount of steam.A good buy for a reasonable price.",

GRRRRR Any ideas or suggestions welcome Also, not a fan of the blue plastic --- looks pretty, but hard to know level of water. I need to rethink my next iron purchase carefully.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this one because someone said it never stops steaming, and I wanted an iron that had auto steam at all heat settings. This one has auto steam in the middle heat settings, which is good, but not at low settings. However, the steam button still works at low heat settings (the iron I tried before this one wouldn\u2019t steam with the button at low settings), so I\u2019m happy with it considering how hard it seems to be to figure out which irons auto steam or even have steam with the button at low settings. I\u2019m too novice to know when I\u2019d ever want to dry iron anything lol. But I like steam!!CONSThe cord does get stuck in the last foot of coiling back up into the iron, which isn\u2019t too big a deal. And I wish there were steam holes up near the point of the plate, particularly for trying to iron a specific item that had short, pleated pieces of fabric against parts I didn\u2019t want to iron. But I managed. For this, I should give the iron 4 stars for how it met my specific needs, but I\u2019m not sure if other people might be REALLY glad it doesn\u2019t have steam holes closer to the point? I was trying to achieve a thing, and I couldn\u2019t easily, but there\u2019s probably a trade off somewhere that I don\u2019t have the experience to see.PROSThe heat setting dial is easy to get to and see as it\u2019s on the top of the iron. The steam buttons are easy to press. The tank is easy to fill and empty, and I can see the water level. Oh, and I\u2019ve had ZERO drips!!I\u2019m definitely happy with the iron. I wanted steam. I got steam. I just have to do a little work to get the steam I want sometimes.",

I bought this one because I thought since the wattage was 1800, it would have higher heat, but it didn't. It's nice looking, light weight, but doesn't get hot enough to knock out wrinkles.",
