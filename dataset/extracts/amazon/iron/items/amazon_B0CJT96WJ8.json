                "reviewText": "Don't let its small size fool you, this mini iron packs a powerful punch. The 1300W heating element ensures quick and efficient ironing. Its compact design is perfect for small spaces or travel. The iron's ability to rotate from 0\u00b0-90\u00b0-180\u00b0 is a game-changer when it comes to ironing collars and cuffs. I love how easily it glides over the fabric, leaving it perfectly pressed.",
