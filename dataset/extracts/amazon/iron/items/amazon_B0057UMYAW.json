                "reviewText": "Sunbeam Hot 2 Trot Travel IronI actually bought this little iron in spite of already having a full-sized iron as well. I quilt, and have a small ironing board set up on a side table next to my sewing machine, and didn't want too big of a draw on the same circuit as my sewing machine. The 800 watts helps me avoid that.I've only had this item in my home for three days, but out of the box, this little work horse was absolutely great. Filling it was different than other irons I've used, but very easy. It heats well, steams well, and all the material I've pressed with it looks great. I'm very happy with the results, and would recommend it to anyone. Nice long 8-foot cord, weight of under 1-1/4 pounds, and the sole plate is not oversized, so I didn't burn my forearm as I reached for something on the ironing board (yes, I've done that in the past). As a travel iron, it has a switch so you can use it for either 120V or 240V, which means it can be used internationally. With the light weight, you really *could* travel with this iron. I can unreservedly recommend this product.Shipping of this Product: I ordered the iron, and it was due to arrive the very next day. Unfortunately, they sent me PPE (the full regalia - acrylic face shields with foam brow seals)(!) I am still mystified as to how someone could confuse the two items, but I don't work in a warehouse, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Obviously, I had to return it and ask them to send me the iron. Which I did, and then it was three days of receiving the dreaded \"we're so sorry your order has been delayed\" message, only to be able to track with UPS that it was not sent when they claimed it was. Not the finest part of the transaction, to say the least. It left me very disappointed and irritated.So, to recap: Travel Iron - Five Stars. Shipping Experience - Negative Points. For what it's worth.",

You have to make sure to get all the water out before you lay it down or it will leak. however, that\u2019s the way a lot of irons are. It does not have an automatic shut off, but for less than $20 it is great value for your money. I will be taking this whenever I go traveling. If you\u2019re on the fence, get it.",

                "reviewText": "This iron is nicely compact and gets hot quickly. I use it for quilting projects. There is one annoyance, though. The cord is attached on the side of the iron instead of the back. As a result, it only naturally falls to the back of the table when used in your right hand. If used in the left hand, the cord wraps around the front and becomes a bit of a hazard for melting and just an annoyance. The only way around it is to use it \"backwards\" with the flat end of the iron to the forward direction and the pointy end to the back.",

                "reviewText": "This iron is so cool. It operates on dual voltage. I often go to Europe and this was so helpful for me. Super life saver. Also it worked very well in UK. This do get super hot if you forget to turn it off, it may burn the cloth. Be aware of that.It clears out tough wrinkles also (like cotton fabrics).I simply love the quality of dual voltage and its very light weight.You can carry this in your carry-on (also in luggage too). Its TSA approved. I always take it in my carry-on because of its light weight.100% recommended item for all travelers \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

It heats to needed temp in just seconds, it's lightweight and the perfect size for storage in small spaces. It takes about 30-45 minutes to cool enough to store. Haven't used the steam function yet. Highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Updated review (3/3/2016)Ok, so I wrote to the customer service requesting a replacement with a non-defective piece or a return (in which case I was planning to buy a new piece). They have arranged to send me a replacement via overnight shipping. Response was fast! Good Job Customer ServicePrevious review (3/2/2016)Just tested the new Sunbeam Hot-2-Trot 800 Watt Compact Travel Iron. Positives: It is really small and compact-perfect size and weight for travel. For its size, it does a reasonable good job of ironing/ removing creases - I tested it on a thin fabric. As long as you do not expect the same results that a larger professional iron would give, you should be happy. Now the negatives: You get what you pay for - It is rather cheaply made. Mine had rough edges visible near the light and came with a small hole (!!) in the blue rubber on top left hand side. There seemed to be some stains on the bottom (soleplate) - not sure if it was due to improper packing or if I was sent a used product. Next, when the iron heats up in the steam mode, it spits water. Overall: Not a great product, but not bad either. It would help if the indicator light did a better job with indicating that the iron is still on (it switches off after a few minutes and there is no way to tell if the iron is on or off-this can be dangerous especially if one forgets to unplug it!). The iron does get a little hot when it is set to the maximum setting. Finally, I wish they would check the pieces before packaging because I bought it to on the request of someone overseas who travels a LOT. I was requested to buy it and test it before bringing it to them, which I just did. I am supposed to bring it for them when I travel to their country in 10 days, but I am a little embarrassed because of the poor craftsmanship of this piece they have sent! I will try to replace with a new one.",

Iron is ergonomically designed to feel very comfortable guiding it. This iron easily holds 100 ml of water (3.25 oz) - I found a small plastic funnel makes it easier to fill the reservoir. Burst of steam function works great. I doubt I'd take it in my luggage when I travel as I travel light. Iron has 240V + 120V switch so it will work in other countries.One warning - the iron heats up very quickly, so place iron in upright position before plugging in.",
