A bonus is the mesh pocket in the top. If you want to take the iron's instruction booklet with you, it fits in there easily. The case is very well made with good molding and quality material. I know it would travel well because what you carry inside will not be moving around. As a former road warrior, that's what you want for travel or for shipping of your items.",
