The appearance is elegant and high-end, and I also love the color. Moreover, the material is very sturdy; the steel frame is made of stainless steel and feels smooth and robust to the touch. The overall product is stable and doesn't wobble, and it can be adjusted according to different heights. Another pleasant surprise is the iron rest area, where I can place the iron when taking a break.This product is also very easy to store; I keep it next to the cabinet, and it doesn't take up much space. The ironing board cover feels great as well; it is heat resistant, and underneath the cover, there are two layers of foam. The cover can be removed, washed and replaced. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a good ironing board!",

                "reviewText": "The reviews I read were accurate. This is a sturdy ironing board that is well padded. My basis for comparison is my roughly 20 year old ironing board that I probably bought for $20 that has long since lost any padding which has reduced to merely cloth over metal, so bear that in mind. But I think it's well padded \ud83d\ude00. It's a little heavier than my old one because of the thick metal legs, but that's why it's so sturdy and I think it's worth the tradeoff. Plus, I'm talking like 2lbs heavier, so not very heavy overall. The surface grips really well, sort of like sandpaper, which I'm not used to. I think I like it, and so far I don't see any damage to my clothes and hope it stays that way. I thought the price was pretty ridiculous for what this is, but I did my research and at least on Amazon it seems like most ironing boards are a lot more expensive than what I remember and this one is certainly not the most expensive so I think it's probably worth spending $20 to $30 more for this one than the cheapest ones that have poor reviews. I'm planning on keeping this one for another 20 years \ud83d\ude05",

Great length, adjustable height and use of safety lock. The ironing rest area is designed to be perfect for resting.It's light, very pretty, and I absolutely love it. It is foldable and very easy to carry and store.When received, the ironing cover has a little wrinkle due to shrink wrap, which is unavoidable. This is not a problem at all for me, I iron the cover carefully before using it. And the ironing cover becomes flat and beautiful.Definitely recommend this product!",
