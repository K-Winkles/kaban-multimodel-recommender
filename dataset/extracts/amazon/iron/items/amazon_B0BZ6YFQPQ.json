Returned it and opted for another manufacturer's lighter-weight model.Update: after some conversation with the seller (YIKA Direct), I found them to be very responsive (a speedy refund and even an offer to send me an iron more suitable for my needs). While I am no longer in need of a travel iron, having purchased another one before my trip, I look forward to doing business with VIKA Direct in the future. They seem like an exemplary seller, offering solid products and great customer service.",

Actually feels like an old time iron. The bottom of the iron has holes for the steam to escape. 14 holes are available to distribute steam. (yep, I counted them \ud83d\ude09) It has a nice yellow color with a beautiful wooden \"look\" handle. The little Port for it to sit on it nice too. The water cup to fill the iron is small. I haven't used it yet but will let you know if it does work like it should. \ud83d\udc8b",
