                "reviewText": "I've had this iron for a while now and use it every weekend when working on a sewing project. At first I didn't like it. Infact, I almost sent it back. My mistake was thinking it would work like my big, regular iron and it doesn't. However, that is it's magic. It's not arm tiring heavy. There is no cord to get in the way and it magically turns itself off if I step away long enough. My regular iron does none of these things. The real eye opening moment was when I used it with a wool pad. It really shined then. It did not shine for me on a regular iron board or pad but a wool pad and the dial turned up far up to the proper setting worked wonders. It has a steam function that can be easily turned on or off and the steam function is good at getting out those pesky wrinkles if you're using a wool ironing pad. It has a carrying case lid and it's very easy and light to transport or to take with you to a friend's house or get together to sew. You also do not need a silicone pad as it rests in its base. I've had it up to max and I've not had any melting or anything of the base. Yes, it stays hot enough for me to make a pass or two and then I put it back in the base, making sure it's all the way back and it will click on and heat up quickly to remove and continue. It's well worth it's cost and I'm glad I didn't give up on it the first time I used it. I love it now and would buy another one in an instant.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a cheap way to find out if cordless irons are any good. This is small, heats up quickly and convenient. There are quite a few draw backs though. It does not get hot enough. I don't know if this is a cordless in general problem or specific to this iron, but it does not get as hot as my corded and doesn't not get hot enough for a lot of my projects. The iron \"times out\" and stops heating too fast. It is not very friendly for tossing something through the machine then pressing. By the time I have ran a few items through, it has stopped heating. Last being continuous ironing. I can't just keep ironing a big area like my whole quilt top without putting it back on the base to heat up multiple times. But I do like the price of it and I do like it for small items at my sewing table.",

It does not hold heat well. no continuous steam for me, needs to be consistently reattached to base, but also difficult to reconnect, good thing amazon took it back for me, so i could try something else. This might be the perfect iron for someone who doesnt need a lot of heat.",
