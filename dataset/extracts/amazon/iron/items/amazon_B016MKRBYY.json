It\u2019s probably a good idea, but that\u2019s where I may have trouble with it in the long run, as I will forget to do so. The irons I own now don\u2019t need to have that done.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised at how light weight this iron is. Easy to fill. Easy to use. Wonderful, not having a cord in the way, especially working on the little pieces and curves of the masks I will be making. It heats up quickly and makes good steam. There are two things that I am having to get used to and the reason for the four star, rather than five. One is the clicking noise of placing and removing the iron from the base. When doing a lot of little pieces, that can get to be a lot of clicking. A little irritating, but not a game changer. I also have to be careful to set iron in base properly each time, to ensure it stays hot. When moving quickly, that might take up an extra nano-second of attention. The other thing is that when I press the steam button, it does not seem to produce steam right away. At first, I\u2019d have the iron back in the base before hearing the steam let loose. Still working on timing, and making sure to press the button and wait long enough for steam to be released. Once it does, it is very effective and there is a fairly lengthy burst, providing steam over a decent amount of time without needing another press of the button. The delay time is perhaps about two nano-seconds and will likely just take some minor adjustment on my part. The water tank seems to hold enough water as to not need constant refilling. I am sure this iron and I will become the best of friends.",
