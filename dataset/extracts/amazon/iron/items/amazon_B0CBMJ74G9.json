                "reviewText": "I bought this both as a travel and hoe steamer because I loathe ironing. I was happy that the water holder comes out for easy filling and refilling, and thus can be easily emptied out to be TSA compliant for flying. It's a bit heavy for a carryon bag but really packs a punch and worked beautifully on a cotton and polyester dress I have as well as things like cotton skirts. I will use this often and love that it came with a heat resistant pad to let it cool off on without damaging any surfaces",
