The taste by itself is not bad at all, no need to mix with juice. I chug it up quickly and then drink water, avoid holding it in your mouth because iron will stain your teeth. I recommend this brand if you want to see real change in your blood results. Also, liquid iron is much better absorbed than pills. I tried pills in the past and they didn\u2019t help at all. I take vitamin C at the same time as the iron because it increases iron absorption.",
