First time in years I havent needed a quarterly iron infusion. I dont like that there are multiple variations in in dosage levels but packaging looks exactly the same. Manufactorer needs to clearly mark packaging so you can tell which version you are selecting. Would prefer two smaller tablets as one dose rather than one horse pill size.",

The pill is rather large, so I usually break it in half to make it easier to swallow. I also take it while I am eating breakfast in the morning to improve absorption. I take this supplement every day and my family and friends say that I am not as pale and look so much better! More importantly, I feel great now!",
