                "reviewText": "I got mad at my billion-dollar Rowenta iron and ordered this budget unit in a fit of pique. Also piqu\u00e9, because the fancy iron keeps melting things to its uncleanable faceplate. About the only thing that iron has going for it is weight. This one, on the other hand, has a lot going for it. It heats up fast. It's not overpowered (no melty mode). Steam comes on almost immediately. It has a huge water tank. It hasn't stuck to anything yet. The faceplate glides over all the weird materials I have thrown at it so far. It's very much on the lightweight side, so I have to do more work to get pleats to stick, but at least it doesn't destroy anything. If you need a basic iron that has a good degree of adjustability and will do a good job without making a mess of things, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better value. If I need more weight, I guess I can just tie a brick to it. :-)",

The plastic casing feels a bit flimsy, and I'm concerned about its long-term durability.Steam Output: The steam output is not as powerful as I expected. It's decent for light wrinkles but may struggle with tougher creases.",
