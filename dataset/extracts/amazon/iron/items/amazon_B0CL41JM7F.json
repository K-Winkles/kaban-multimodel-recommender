                "reviewText": "This little Travel Steamer Iron is, if anything, very compact and lightweight. It heats up in mere seconds. The handle rotates to the 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 positions. You might get the idea from the seller's pictures that this is cordless, but it's not. It has a 56\" electrical cord attached at the butt of the handle (see my pictures). Unlike most irons, it lacks temperature adjustment. The soleplate has a cradle with silicone bumper pads to protect surfaces when the iron is cradled.Filling it is easy: turn the handle 90\u00b0 to gain unobstructed access to the filling port. Pour the water in slowly because it fills up quickly. Also, make sure to close the silicone cap tightly. Unfortunately, I didn't receive a fill cup with the steamer\u2639. It works surprisingly well. I used it to steam out some fold wrinkles in a shower curtain while it was hanging, and I had no problems. It puts out more steam than I thought it would, but that comes with one limitation: it uses water quickly. If you want to dry iron, don't depress the button.Conclusion: This item met my expectations, which is my requirement to receive a four-star review. If it had temperature adjustment and the fill cup wasn't missing, it would likely have exceeded my expectations and received a five-star rating. I also wish they would show it with the cord in at least one of the pictures. So, four stars for the Travel Steamer Iron.",
