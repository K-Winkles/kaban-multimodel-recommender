We were using a different brand that's chewable and tastes decent when this brand came up as a suggested item. I was skeptical about a meltaway. I mean, it's iron, no one wants the taste to linger any longer than it has to! We gave them a try and holy cannoli, this is the best iron supplement I've ever tasted! It tastes like orange candy.

We have tried SO many, but this is the only one my 6 and 4 year old have taken most regularly. Every so often they say it's \"too sour,\" but it's the most consistent one they've taken. I've tried some and they have a strong orange flavor.",
