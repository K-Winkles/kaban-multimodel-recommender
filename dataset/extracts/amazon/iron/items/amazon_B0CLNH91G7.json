Didn\u2019t turn out so hot till a biker came along and brought her to Hades Abyss. Iron aka Jack was stunned. He couldn\u2019t believe that this little woman could endure so much and yet she held on. Something just clicked within him and he knew she was the one. I love that Nari is Korean. YEAH!!! So now we get to add that culture to the mix. And yep, being Korean, I do the shoes off too. It just keeps things cleaner. But that is me. Nari suffered so much from her father. I was so shocked to read how he treated her. I guess I didn\u2019t expect it. And then you have Iron. He was a bit of a jerk in the last book. But I guess he just needed to settle down and find a place for himself. He needed stability and a reason. Nari gives him that and more. I can\u2019t believe that they all had a hand in it. Crazy. I loved this book. I wonder if we will find someone for Marauder. Nora perhaps.",

Iron isn't known for being sweet but he pulls out all the stops for Nari. He doesn't hesitate to put her first, making her feel safe and comfortable. Nari's life has been literally garbage for as long as she can recall. No one has been as kind and caring, loving and supportive as Iron. His presence in her life brings her a family. His sister and his dad immediately welcome her with open arms and my heart just melted. The sweet revenge the club gets for Nari is brutal but very much deserved. Just wonderful!!",

He is incredible with her and gives her the family and confidence she always should've had. Her family are just the worst kind of people, abusive and cruel to so many. This book has some dark elements that center around abuse in all its forms and violence. I'm looking forward to whoever is next!",
