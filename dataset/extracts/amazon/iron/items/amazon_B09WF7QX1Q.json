                "reviewText": "I love love love this iron.I sew 8-10 hours a day. I want my iron on all day. You can turn off the shut-off timer which is the main reason I bought this iron.I've had several other brands and so far this one is worth the higher price. I hope it lasts me for the rest of my life.It has a little switch that lets you turn on the handle's steam switch. While the steam switch is on, when you grab the handle it shoots out high pressure steam.I turn the steam switch on and off all the time. Some times I want the the full steam. Sometimes I want the steam off because I'm working on something that requires me holding my fingers close to the iron.It's very easy to use. And nice and heavy, irons fabric beautifully.Filling the water reservoir is a bit awkward as you have to hold the iron at an angle, so it doesn't spill. But with the little water cup provided, it's a lot easier.The little trap door is a little hard to open but that's good because it doesn't leak when you use the iron. I will most definitely put up with this little awkwardness.It has heat setting 1-8. Hold the round switch to the right, it turns on. (Stop at the heat setting you want)Hold it to the left, it counts all the way down to zero and turns off.",

                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful iron, although if you have weakness in your hands you might want to go with something more lightweight. The steam and temperature control is excellent. Related to prior reviews: the temperature settings are numeric and a little bit cryptic, but they are all printed on the base of the iron and so there is no need to consult the manual. And as a sound-sensitive person I do agree that this is a louder iron than I am accustomed to. I turn it off when not in immediate use, but this tradeoff is well worth it for the amazing result I am getting with my pressing.",

                "reviewText": "I love this iron. It replaces a spitting Rowenta I've had for years. I like the heavier weight of it and especially because I can disable the auto-off function. I love the wide variety of different heat settings depending on what fabric is involved and functions are easy to switch between. It's super easy to switch from steam to dry ironing and the water tank is quite large. There isn't anything I can fault this iron for now that I've found out how to turn down the massive amount of steam it puts out. Everything about this iron is spot on and extremely well thought out.",

                "reviewText": "Just for context, I'm a quilter and a long time Rowenta user. I got tired of leaky Rowentas, so thought I would give the Velocity 270IR a try. I've had it for about a week and have used it for several hours. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I'm not 100% certain I would buy the same model again.Pros: It heats up quickly and produces plenty of heat and steam at the highest setting. The weight is comparable to my old Rowenta, which is a plus for me, but could be a con for anyone who doesn't like a heavy iron. The controls are straightforward, though I find the temp setting control stiff enough that I usually have to put both hands on the iron to change it.Cons: The following aspects annoy me, but could just as easily be an advantage to someone else.* It's \"chatty\". It beeps when it reaches temp (fine), it mutters the entire time you're actively pressing with steam. (I think it's the steam generator and so WAI.) It ticks when it is on standby. Please, shut up.* You have to set the temp, the steam on/off, and disable the auto-shut off every time you turn it on. This is a consequence of the digital controls that I had not thought of, and makes me wish it was mechanical.* The fill cover is quite stiff and thus a little difficult to open. I have to pry it up with a pen or scissors.* The anodized sole plate does not glide over the fabric as readily as the stainless sole plate I've had in the past.So far, so good on the leak front, but it's too soon to tell. IME, no iron leaks when it's new.",

                "reviewText": "Below was my 1st review and I am now updating. After my 1st review the company reached out to me and after asking questions, they asked me to send a video of the iron for their technicians. A few days later, they said they would send me a return label for me to send them the iron. 2 to 3 weeks after I sent them the iron, I received a new iron in the mail. How happy I am to have my dream iron back! It works SO much better than the well-known brand name iron I bought to use while I was waiting for my Reliable iron to come back. I am very happily surprised that the company read the review and addressed my concerns. Thank you Reliable!1st review: I loved this iron until it stopped working. The features of this iron were all that I wanted in an iron, and it worked beautifully from December 22, 2023 until September 3, 2023. For the price I expected it to last longer. I followed the instructions. I would buy this again if it had lasted longer because it really was a dream. But I can't justify the price if I have to buy one every 9 months. I sew every day and use an iron every day. I turned it off with my light switch which worked well for me because I really liked the feature where I could turn off the auto turn-off. I am disappointed.",
