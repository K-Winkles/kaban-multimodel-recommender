Only now, you\u2019re family. We focus on natural, quality ingredients that are well tolerated and do the job in a big way.

My daughter needs 2ml of iron drops per day\u2014I bought these after reading reviews because the enfamil drops made her gay and vomit immediately. She still makes a disgusted face for these drops, but she doesn\u2019t gag and vomit so that\u2019s progress. I tasted these drops myself and they are definitely better than enfamil which have no flavoring other than iron, but these do still have that lingering iron flavor as if you had a mouthful of coins. It\u2019s just a little lighter and masked by the cough syrup flavor.",
