                "reviewText": "I was looking for a liquid iron that would not constipate my 85+ yr old mother. I found this and was excited for her to try it. She did and liked the flavor. However, when my subscription was sent the price went up $10 and it wasn't even 6 months after the original purchase. Today I looked at it again to see if the price was reduced and now it's double what I originally paid for it. So, I will continue to seek an AFFORDABLE liquid iron for her to take to help build her blood.",

It's actually the smaller bottle. I will go to A vitamin store for my next purchase. Hopefully, they still have the larger bottle for that price. Having said that, the product is great and tastes pretty good.",
