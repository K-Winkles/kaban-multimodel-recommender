This has solved the problem completely. I just put a towel on the table and put the garment on it while this little iron is heating up. Extremely lightweight, it\u2019s easy to use, very compact to store, and does the job of the big irons. I highly recommend this for home or travel.",

My regular sized iron takes some time to heat and it takes a few passes for wrinkles to go away. It doesn\u2019t take much enough for this iron to remove wrinkles. I like the titanium plate in the bottom. It is smooth and is durable. Due to the small size of the iron it is easy to navigate around buttons and collars. I find this easier to use and faster compared to a regular sized iron. This iron is perfect for traveling. It can be used instead of the dirty ones at the hotel rooms. It is advised to give the iron about some time (about 30 seconds) to fully heat up before starting and also to drain out any remaining water in the iron to prevent leaks. Overall, a good value and a functioning mini iron.",

It can be rotated 90 degrees.however, I have few things I do not like about the mini steamer.The wire cord is too short. I case where the electric power outlet is not so close, this mini steamer will not have anywhere to be plugged in.When holding the handle, it feels crampy as my hands could hold the handle properly, there is not give good clearance for my hand, so I was not able to hold the handle very well.",

Its 90\u00b0 rotating feature is a standout, allowing me to deftly maneuver around buttons and pleats with ease. The 1000W power is impressive for its size, producing a strong steam that smooths out wrinkles efficiently, which is quite the feat for a portable steamer.One of the things I love about this iron is its dual dry and wet ironing capabilities. Whether I'm in a hurry to touch up a shirt with the dry heat or need to steam out the suitcase creases from a dress, this little gadget has me covered. It heats up quickly, saving me precious time when I'm on the go.Its compact size is perfect for stowing away in my luggage without taking up much space or adding excessive weight. Despite its small stature, the water reservoir is adequately sized, so I'm not constantly refilling it during a single ironing session.The design is sleek and modern, and it feels sturdy in the hand. The handle is comfortable to hold, reducing fatigue, which is especially appreciated after a long day of travel.",

It avoids me having to take out the ironing board to dry iron the garment. The ability to rotate the head 90 degrees, helps with even more surface coverage for faster steaming. I am also using distilled water in the steam iron to prevent any mineral deposits in the steaming system. This mini steam iron is great for a quick steam to refresh a wrinkled garment for immediate wear.",
