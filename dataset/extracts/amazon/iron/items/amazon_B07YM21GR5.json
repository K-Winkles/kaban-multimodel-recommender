I don't blame the product because even pills I have tried tasted like iron as well as it is a strong flavor. Unfortunately, the iron flavor was a bit more noticeable after this was refrigerated which is necessary after opening it.Still this was a life saver since I had very low iron and don't do well swallowing pills. The liquid makes it easy to get the amount I need and I believe it worked well as far as absorbency goes because my Iron levels were back to normal after I had been taking this for a couple months and rechecked my bloodwork.I'm going to stick with this brand for any vitamins or supplements I need in the future.",

In my experience, pills are not absorbed well and I have seen little results from them. So, I turned to liquid supplements hoping to increase absorption, but most take disgusting. This one is the most pleasant of all the liquid iron supplements I have taken. It has a pleasant berry flavor and a just a slight noticeable aftertaste. I mix it with just a couple of ounces of apple juice and chase it with a little water. I have been trying to avoid iron infusions and opted to faithfully take this one. My hematologist told me new studies now show taking iron every other day actually gives you better absorption. So, I have been taking this iron for about 6 months and have watched my iron steadily increase, so it is working! I am thrilled. I won't use any other brand.",

I am glad there's a product out there like this. Iron is one of many essential minerals needed. This is our second bottle and we will keep purchasing in the future. We also use the multi-vitamin essentials (fruit punch) and the coconut dream. Both are wonderful flavors which maintains the motivation to take it. However, if you don't like Pina coladas you won't like the coconut dream. I'm excited to try their other products and start replacing all the pill bottles with Mary Ruth. :)",

El sabor es bueno, la verdad est\u00e1 muy dulce y considero que los ni\u00f1os pueden aceptarlo sin problema. Tambi\u00e9n me percat\u00e9 que me he enfermado muy poco y cuando me sucedi\u00f3 la verdad fue algo ligero, adem\u00e1s en la \u00e9poca en la que vivimos el riesgo de las enfermedades es elevado, as\u00ed que agradezco que haya ayudado a fortalecer mi sistema inmune porque he estado expuesta y no me ha pasado nada. A\u00fan espero que me ayude con las canas y que esto sea cierto, sin embargo, como multivitam\u00ednico es excelente. Adicional, gracias por bajar el precio porque en un momento estaba sumamente elevado. Si lo recomiendo, si quieres fortalecer tu sistema inmune, quieres sentir m\u00e1s energ\u00eda y aportar antioxidantes a tu cuerpo.",
