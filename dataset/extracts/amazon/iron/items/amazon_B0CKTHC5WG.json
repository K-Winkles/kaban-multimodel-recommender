I can iron and steam my clothes in one go, and it's very convenient to travel with. The 180\u00b0 rotation feature is amazing, it lets me reach every corner and crease without any hassle. The steamer is also very lightweight and compact, so it doesn't take up much space in my luggage. Comes with a small travel bag. It's definitely a must-have for anyone who needs a quick and effective way to freshen up their clothes. I recommend this product!",

The head swivels out and clicks into a horizontal and then fully vertical position, or you can leave it in it's original state. Once you plug it in it heats up quick! To use the steaming function you press the steam button and within 10-20 seconds this little guy starts to shoot an impressive stream out. The reservoir is tiny which is to be expected but holds plenty of water to steam out a few garments at a time. I do wish the face plate that you use to rest the iron on physically clicked onto the iron but not a big deal at all.",

Just add water to the iron steamer and plug into your outlet.I was impressed how well I could iron my clothes to remove wrinkles out quickly.The small iron will be a great travel essential and the price was good for this product.",

                "reviewText": "This steamer is very compact. It comes with a little measuring cup to add water to the reservoir. If you have hard water I would recommend using distilled water to lengthen the life of your appliance. The cord is a heavy braided cord that seems very thick and durable. I was shocked at how quickly this steam iron heats up. After plugging it in, it starts to heat up immediately and within 10 seconds it was already hot to the touch. You can use it horizontally as an iron, or vertically as a steamer. I opted to use it as a steamer. My closet is packed so tightly with clothes that if my blouses hang in there for too long they get wrinkly. This steamer did amazing at quickly taking the wrinkles out. With the steam button turned out it shoots out heavy puffs of steam and I could watch the wrinkles fall out before my eyes,This is great for traveling because it's so compact. Highly recommended!",

It is great that it is small and portable. It is a bit too simple, however, as you cannot control the temp. So be careful when using it on certain fabrics (i normally put a thin fabric between the iron and the delicate to avoid any problems.Otherwise, a very good product.",

The design and color are great, and it's so comact to make it perfect for travel to get your shirts and pants out of wrinkles. The iron comes with a little cup to put water in and a cover to place the iron down on when hot. The greatest thing is it gets hot almost immediately after plugging it in. The iron works perfectly, not just for travel, I use it at home as well. It's so small I'm just putting it in my dresser drawer.",
