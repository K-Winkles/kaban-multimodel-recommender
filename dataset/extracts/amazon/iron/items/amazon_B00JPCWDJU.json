There is a little space and if you are slow and align the cord around, it is out of the way. Now, there is no way to keep it there, but, I found a way that works for me. I used a hair rubberband and put it over the plug and just twist it once and pulled the other end over the top end of the iron (the point). It is perfect now. The cord doesn\u2019t fly everywhere. Oh, the iron\u2014great purchase, light weight, functions well. If it is good for an hotel chain\u2026 it\u2019s good enough! I do not iron a lot. It also can be used as a quick steamer. I always thought an iron had to be heavy to be good\u2026and, this has convinced me otherwise.",

It lasted for seven years and did a beautiful job getting wrinkles out of clothing and pressing fabric for sewing. After it wore out, I used an older Rowenta my husband had and was never very satisfied with it. It leaked a lot more, didn't get as hot, and the mister eventually broke in it. When it wore out completely, I purchased this iron and have been delighted with it for over a year. It is the same quality as my old one, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable and reliable iron.",

                "reviewText": "This is the closest iron I could find to my last one that lasted me 10 years. I originally purchased my old iron for keeping shirts neat but it has served me well through many years of garment sewing and quilting. When it finally died after an electrical surge I wanted to get the same thing, and I did. This one has a good weight (not too heavy, not too light), versatile steam functions, and important safety features (since I do sometimes forget to turn it off). Hopefully this one lasts another 10 years.",

Use it for pressing seams when I'm quilting, sits on the same table all the time. I don't know that I've ever dropped it or banged it around at all. Plugged it in today and it just won't get hot. Light doesn't come on. 3 years of light use.",

Now I ordered a few T-shirts, tops and boleros that have chiffon or are entirely chiffon, so they need ironing to fall properrly. This one works like crazy, the steam function is amazing and in minutes the work is done.Very happy with purchase and highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This Sunbeam steam iron is in overall pretty good. I love the titanium plate and it glides so easy on my fabric. When not in use in the upright position, it stays on for 30 minutes which is a great bonus for me, most of them it is only 8 minutes and as I do a lot of small project, I could be at the sewing machine for more than 8 minutes and when I need the iron, I need it to be on. So far my only complaint is that even in the off position, the light still blinks on and off which I believe keeps the handle a touch warm from the light. I am not sure if this is suppose to be like this, anyone who has an answer for me on this, would be much appreciated.",
