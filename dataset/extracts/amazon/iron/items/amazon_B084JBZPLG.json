DG8624 1800 Watts(Dark blue handle and dark blue tank)Stainless Steel Soleplate and interior tank, 1.1 Liter Capacity Removable Tank, Iron- SteamerI DISCOVERED THE WATER FILL LINE is actually the bottom of the indented handle-- POUR (1.1 liters) 4.5CUPS OF WATER INTO THE EMPTY TANK--how clever--you will see what I mean--but it is difficult to see the water level through the dark blue plastic.AMAZING! Cut your ironing to 3/4 the time. I loved my regular type, top of line Rowenta iron (that stays on instead of keep shutting off) and --then I dropped it on tile floor and the plastic water container cracked. To replace it would be around $100. I researched irons and discovered the steam station--It has been so worth it even though it costs a bit more. It is amazing because1) it heats up fast2) the motor is not disturbing-- is NOT loud: (THE QUIET MOTOR only turns on when you press the steam button--and runs about 5 seconds every once in awhile ) (I can iron for hours with toddler taking naps 6 feet away in the same room(The Motor: I have only used regular irons and didn\u2019t know that steam systems (with table top tanks) without the \u201cmotor\u201d have to be placed higher than the iron so the water flows). BE GRATEFUL FOR THE MOTOR!3) the INTERIOR STAINLESS STEEL PARTS of the tank takes 1 liter of TAP WATER: --fill anytime while ironing--do not use distilled water (or 1/2 of regular and distilled--to use up your extra supply of distilled jugs)4) a light comes on when a simple calcium cleaning needs to be done (watch Youtube video)5) the STEAM PLATE is fantastic with so many holes--when you press the steam button--a flood of hot mist comes out--no drips, in one second creases in fabric disappear-and the steam button you push is so lightly sprung-your finger never gets tired pushing the button (which was a complaint with a different iron I used to have)6) the unit is NOT BULKY--it seems like it would be--but the whole unit is easy to lift up to store or move--if you have a laundry room closet--you could literally keep the unit in the closet, pull up your ironing board and iron right there or on the counter and not move the iron base unit at all. THE STEAM CORD IS VERY LONG AND CONVENIENT.7) the iron itself IS SO LIGHTWEIGHT and streamline--you aren\u2019t pushing and lifting a heavy, bulky iron equipped with a water tank and heating element parts.8) if you love yourself and love your time--try out this steam systemYoutube: watch the few videos about this steam iron system: (the very hard to find) sole plate accessory is recommended: Rowenta ZD7900D1 - ironing accessories",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Rowenta Steam Station to replace an earlier version because it has an excellent shot of steam, it holds a lot of water and because it stays on for 30 minutes before the auto shut off kicks in. This is important for sewers. It does go on standby after 8 minutes, but quickly revives itself with a push of a button. It is important to clean the calcium collector frequently if you have hard water--which is how I ruined the earlier one. After five months, the shot of steam stopped working consistently. I contacted the warranty department by email and after several emails verifying my purchase, I was issued a case number. I then called the warranty department with the case number and they emailed a UPS prepaid label to me. I packed it up and sent it to a repair shop on a Monday and received a repaired iron back about a week and a half later. I was shocked it took so little time. The iron works perfectly again. Very pleased with this product and the prompt repair.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot say enough good things about this iron. To start off, I am someone that does iron a good bit on a weekly basis (I\u2019m the person that still irons their bedsheets lol) and this is a HUGE upgrade to my old iron. I used a Rowenta steam iron for years until I tried to DIY deep clean it and ruined it (helpful hint: never put red wine vinegar in as a replacement to distilled white vinegar\u2026not the same haha). This iron steams like NO OTHER- it\u2019s got some power! What\u2019s nice is the steam doesn\u2019t ever squirt water, it\u2019s all steam all the time. Takes a couple mins to heat up but once it\u2019s warm, it\u2019s ready to go. Easy to move around with the base attachment and feels very well built, like all other Rowenta products.Highly recommend this if you\u2019re on the hunt for an iron with some power and want to make your ironing even faster!",

                "reviewText": "This iron sits on the end of my ironing board where I used to put starch, scissors etc. Easy on/off. Easy fill - and less filling! I haven't had to clean the caulk out yet but that also looks very easy. I iron everything from dish towels to king-sized bed sheets. The steam from this makes it so much easier! And if you accidentally put a crease where you don't want it; you can get it right out! This iron is amazing! I bought the 3 year warranty because I've had trouble in the past with seals in Rowenta irons. But even so, this iron should never spit water all over your clothes because the water tank NOT in the iron. I'm hoping for a long, happy future!",
