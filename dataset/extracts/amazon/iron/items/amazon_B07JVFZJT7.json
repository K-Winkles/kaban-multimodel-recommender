The iron works perfectly, I do not have to turn the heat up as much as I used too, steam function is great and works very well. There is weight to iron which I personally like as it irons smoothly. The lead is long, and the water container is larger than most. So pleased with my purchase, I would buy another.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m writing this detailed review because I found the subject of researching, purchasing, and using under-performing irons so annoying and hoping this will help you avoid the same. This review applies to my personal application and experience. Both of those may differ for you.First some context for this review. I pretty much exclusively use the iron to iron my long sleeve dress shirts for work. I work fast and need an iron that can keep up with me (producing steam) as I iron, set the iron down, move the shirt to the next position, iron set the iron down etc. about 10 times per shirt. I set the iron to \u2018Cotton\u201d and get busy. I just need an iron that constantly produces plenty of steam. I don\u2019t use the spray or vertical steam features. It takes me about 3 minutes per shirt \u2013 which is faster and cheaper than making trips to the cleaners. I have not had any of the irons long enough to provide a long-term or reliability review. If anything annoying occurs I will come back and edit this review if I am able.I purchased and tested each of these irons on the same shirts (pic)1) First purchase: Rowenta Focus $87Summary: this iron could not keep up with me. Seemed to produce steam randomly in short bursts when it felt like it. I often found myself ironing soleplate down without any steam at all. I thought the unit must be defective. I returned in exchange for another one. Same issue with the second one.I would return it if I could, but am outside the return window. I would not recommend this iron. Will be donating this to charity. Maybe it will suit someone else better.Will not bother with Pros & Cons here.2) Second purchase: Rowenta Steamforce $152Summary: upon opening, it was clear that this was a unit had already been ordered and returned by another customer. Based on past experience accepting somebody else\u2019s return is a nonstarter \u2013 especially at this price point. This is not the first time Amazon has sent someone else\u2019s reject as new. Very disappointing. I returned in exchange for another one. The second one arrived in new and unused condition \u2013 although I wish the manufacturer would seal the box at the factory so it is clear if the box has been previously opened.Pros:- Slick easy gliding soleplate- Plenty of steam- Simple light indicating fabric setting (pic)- Narrow nose for tight spaces- Simple on/off steam setting (I don\u2019t need anything in between)Cons:- Price \u2013 yikes!- Easy to accidentally hit fabric selection dial and change setting. Frustrating.- A little bit of non-consequential spittingThis was the best of the three irons for my needs. Would recommend.3) Third purchase: PurSteam Professional Grade 1800-Watt Iron with Digital LCD Screen $42Summary: this one arrived in a box properly sealed by the manufacturer \u2013 easy to tell that I was the first person opening the box. Thank you!Pros:- Great price- Sufficient steam- LED fabric selector - No manual dial to knock out of position. Yay! Thank you! (pic)- Easy to fill water tankCons:- Literally ran out of steam when tank reached 25% full (pic)I would recommend this iron. Instead of returning, I will keep as a very capable backup.Hope this review saves you some of the time and grief I experienced. If anyone has recommendation for a top-notch ironing board cover, I\u2019d be happy to hear about it.",

                "reviewText": "This iron overall seems very good, though the pictures at the top of the page show the 1800 watt version with the LCD screen with the description for the 1700 watt version\u2026so I thought the only difference between was the wattage and price. That was my fault for not scrolling further down the item page to see the actual pictures of the product. Amazon, maybe fix this issue?On to the iron itself, It does heat up quickly and seems to work great on the cotton temp and steam settings, but the wool temp setting with the appropriate steam setting doesn\u2019t seem as hot as my previous Hamilton Beach iron. I also wish the steam setting slider was fully adjustable\u2026this only allows for 3 settings based on which temperature you\u2019ve selected. This again doesn\u2019t lead to as much steam coming out on the wool temp setting. My previous iron allowed me to dial in an ideal amount of steam output. I can certainly play with the settings and see what works best, but just these couple of nitpicks. Otherwise I\u2019m pretty happy so far with it.",

I did see the iron advertised in other retailers but the price was way too high. I hope this helps you with your purchase.",

The linen setting is the best for our new linen sheets. Yes, I\u2019m ironing sheets and pillowcases now! Lol!",
