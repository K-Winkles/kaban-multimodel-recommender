                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My daughter (8 yo) has been wanting to make stuff with perler beads for the longest time, and even tho she had plenty of perler beads (she was gifted a few on Christmas and her bday), I was a little hesitant to let her use a regular iron as I felt it was a little heavy and big for her small hands. That\u2019s when I decided to look on Amazon for a crafts iron, and this one popped up, and it\u2019s been great!Pros:* Perfect for small hands* No need to use water* Easy to use* Works great for small projects* Price is goodCons:* Looks cheaply made* It takes a few minutes to warm up* Cord is not long enough* Also cord kinda gets in the way. It\u2019ll be better if the cord was on the back rather than the sideOverall, we\u2019re very pleased. My daughter has been working on projects almost daily and she loves that she can use the iron on her own.",

No need to get up and use the regular size iron.They get hot. We only use them once a week for about 2 hours.Not sure howlong they will last. BUT they are working great for now. Some even use them in their quilting class to press their completed blocks.Happy they offer so many colors also.",

                "reviewText": "This is the cutest little iron ever. It's very small. It looks like a toy, but it's not. It fits in the palm of my hand, is very lightweight, and appears to be mostly plastic. It takes about 5 minutes to heat up and doesn't get as hot as my full size iron, but it does what I need it to do, which is just light ironing on craft projects. My biggest complaint (and if I had realized this, it would have been a deal breaker), is that the cord is so short. I do not understand who would ever think that a 3' cord is adequate. I don't have outlets above my desk. Most outlets are near the floor. There is no way to use this little thing without an extension cord.",

                "reviewText": "Adorable little iron! I bought for sewing projects as I don\u2019t need a large one to just press seams and it mostly does the trick. It doesn\u2019t ever warm up as much as I wish it would and so it\u2019ll take me going over the same bit of fabric three or four times before it actually stays down. But it\u2019s cute and helpful.One other thing to keep in mind is cord length, I didn\u2019t take note of it but it is a tad annoying how short it is, I generally have to move my projects around to iron the whole thing as it does reach very far. Cute! But not much more than that!",
