                "reviewText": "It's a simple iron steamer that swivels making it all fancy.The ironing part works just fine, I applied a patch to a t-shirt without any issues.The steaming portion is hit or miss depending on material and how strong you apply the steam. I've owned a dedicated suit steamer in the past and this one works not as well honestly. I can't really fault it though as it's a dual purpose iron..so something needs to take a hit for the versatility. If you have never ever owned a steaming shirt machine before then yes I would say there will be some frustration!I needed to reduce the steam setting and go slower, otherwise it would flood the shirt and make it damp. Not exactly the result I was looking for but workable.Overall if you don't want to invest in two different machines yes it works, dry ironing is the strong point here and you need to fiddle a bit to find your appropriate settings vs materials on the steaming side.The original price tag when sent for review was way too high, but I see they dropped it significantly to around fifty dollars as I am writing this - so for that price yes, it's worth taking a look at too see if it suits your dual needs, as a regular single iron will cost just as much.One noted point to the company though - I missed the standard \"pointy\" style nose of regular irons while using this as it's quite effective at certain spots when putting patches and stuff on clothing. The tiny point on this one I found didn't quite satisfy that and needs to be a bit more pronounced.",

Very nice device, it\u2019s got like a retro but modern look. Also there is a very nice analogue temperature dial right on top.Functionally this iron is awesome. I ironed my shirts and collars on an ironing board, then my wife turned up the steam and steamed her blouse on a hanger. On full throttle it pumps ALOT of steam, I tried to get a picture but steam is a tough thing to get a photo of.This is a beautiful and very good quality steamer/ iron and I highly recommend.
