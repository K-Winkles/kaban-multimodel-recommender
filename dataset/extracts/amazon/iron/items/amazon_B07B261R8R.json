It's on for several hours at a time. So far, it has performed beautifully. The iron obviously does not stand upright since it's pointed at both ends. It must be returned to its power base in between ironing sweeps. This takes some getting used to but this little hassle is worth the many other benefits of a cordless iron that maintains high temps, ample steam, and can be used in both directions by either left or right hands.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to use this for a while before reviewing. I am a quilter so was looking for an iron that would flatten seams well and provide freedom to get around large pieces without tangling. This handles both of those very well. This was really my first fancy iron (ie, more than $40) but I love the cordless option, it's probably a third the weight of my old iron and flattens seams vastly better than anything I've ever used. Drawbacks are that it has a fairly small surface area, it does require pausing in between segments to reheat (which if you are shifting fabric or finger pressing seams before ironing like I do isn't actually problematic), and there is some static-clinginess which I believe is from the ceramic plate. It's a fantastic iron for my purposes though.",

                "reviewText": "I had this exact same iron that I purchased almost 10yrs ago. The prong from the cord broke, so I purchased this one from Amazon. CON : For some reason this one doesn't get as hot or stay on as long as my old iron (same iron). The iron doesn't stay on very long, so you have to constantly place it back on the base for a few seconds to heat back up. Plus the carrying case is extremely hard to open. Seems a bit defective. So, I reverted to using my old iron and placing it on the new base stand. WAALA!A!! Problem solved! Old iron with new base stand was the perfect solution. PRO'S; I love the steam feature on this iron. I don't do much hard pressing of clothes anyway. I mainly use this iron to steam wrinkles out. If I didn't have my old iron, I would've returned this new one! Otherwise, if you don't need to hard press for long periods of time, this iron will work great for you. Great for ironing in any direction. Has an automatic cut off. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy!",

There's some sort of non stick coating, it looks similar to the non stick coating the Zojirushi rice cooker and bread maker uses and nothing ever seems to stick to.It's the best iron I've ever used but I hope it lasts a long time",

                "reviewText": "Our old iron finally died and I went online to find another good one that would last a long time. This one came up a bit and the cordless option was nice offering versatility. Although until I used it I had no idea that it wasn\u2019t quite what I was expecting. The base provides the electricity to heat the iron, and you remove it and it stays hot for a bit of time. As much as this sounds like a hassle, I rarely need the iron in my had for extended periods and put it down anyways. Where this unit shines is the cord no longer interferes with what I am doing. Also it is super light as I guess some of the weight has been moved to the base station. This is a great iron and if it lasts more than 5 years I will be thrilled.",
