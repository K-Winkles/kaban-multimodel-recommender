                "reviewText": "Travel iron? This cute thing is almost pocket-sized - and it steams! I bought a \"travel\" iron last year at a store and didn't think they could get smaller, but I was wrong. The first thing I noticed about this travel iron was the cord. It is thick with a fabric material, which I hope means it is long-lasting. Another cool feature is the rubber pad to help block the hot plate from damaging other things in transit. The iron's plate heats up pretty quickly. By the time it was plugged in for 24 seconds, I could no longer sweep it across my hand.To my surprise (at the cost of 1 star), there is no power switch, button, or dial. The instructions say to power off the iron before unplugging it, yet the only way to cut power IS to unplug it. The only button on this unit is a steam button. Between ironings if you want to rest the iron, turn the handle to an \"L\" shape and set it on a flat surface. You MUST exercise extreme caution because there is only one place to hold the iron when it's hot. The water refill cup is handy; a nylon travel bag would've earned half a star in the rating! It took 2-3 initial presses before the water sprayer dispensed. Overall, good pick!",

Sitting makes our clothes wrinkle and going before a judge like that... or a jury! That's a no-no. This is small enough to keep my desk drawer without taking up too much space and easy enough to plug in and use quickly. I do think the steam option could be better, but as an iron, it works great!",
