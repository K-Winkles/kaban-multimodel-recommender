The only annoyance is that it has a safety feature that cuts heating to the iron if the iron is horizontal for more than 10 seconds or so. Because of this, you're constantly re-orienting the iron every 10 seconds to continue using it. Not exactly a deal breaker because of the price, but something to keep in mind.",
