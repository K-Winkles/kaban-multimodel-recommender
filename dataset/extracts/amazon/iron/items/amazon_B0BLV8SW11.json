                "reviewText": "Lightweight, foldable, takes up very little space, and works great. The silicone mat is important as it gives you a place to set the iron down between ironings. I prefer ironed, wrinkle-free clothing at all times but I also like to travel light - this works as a perfect solution for me as I can press items when I need them. This iron heats up fast, gets hot enough to work well (even in Europe when using less amps), has a long cord for negotiating hard to reach outlets, and comes with a silicon pad for a safe cooling.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because it's been a bit of a nuisance steaming all the clothes we own. I chose this because it's cute, small, and I wanted to match our white and gold steamer. It does its job well, but it's much too small to use regularly. It would work well as a travel iron, but when ironing many clothes, the size just becomes too uncomfortable in your hand. Also, the silicone heat protectant pad it comes with gets very, very hot. I rested the pad on top of a box when I first tried it, and as it heated up, the heat from the iron started burning the box. It's not a big deal, but I do imagine that the heat may damage a surface if you're not careful. This will be a great tool when traveling, but I'll need to buy another iron for day to day use.",

                "reviewText": "I specifically waited to do my ironing today until I receive this tiny iron. I had 100% cotton shirts and some sweaters which I won\u2019t have these when I travel but I wanted to see. So it was effective on 100% shirts but it takes longer obviously \ud83d\ude09 other stuff I was pretty happy. The hotel irons are almost always horribly leaks with calcium deposits and I always had to use muslin sheets to iron my clothes, not anymore.Two things are not my favorite (but not deal breakers):The cable is bulky and stiff, for little iron it\u2019s too thick (which is normal for the voltage) so it slows to glide.The iron gets hot and the silicon mat is good for it but that gets hot as well, so be careful where you position the silicone and after you\u2019re done make sure it\u2019s on a safe until it cools down.",

Durch das geringe Gewicht muss man nat\u00fcrlich bedenken die B\u00fcgelw\u00e4sche entsprechend mit dem angelieferten Befeuchter gut vorzubereiten oder evtl. auf das B\u00fcgeleisen mehr Druck auszu\u00fcben. Von Vorteil nat\u00fcrlich f\u00fcr Flugreisen, da es geringes Gewicht und klein. Die Abk\u00fchlphase d\u00fcrfte etwas k\u00fcrzer ausfallen aber ansonsten tolles Ger\u00e4t!",
