                "reviewText": "Full disclosure: I've always hated ironing. It's just such a drag pulling out my very heavy ironing board, and using an \"old-fashioned\" iron on my clothes. I'm not all that great at ironing, and sometimes I accidently iron in creases while I'm ironing out wrinkles. Absolutely one of my least-favorite chores. Enter this cute little steamer! It's so easy at 3:00 am, to just hang a shirt on the bathroom door and plug in this little steamer, which heats up super fast, and easily steam any wrinkles out. Easy peasy. It really works, and very quickly! It's also very attractive, with the beige color, brass hardware, and a handle that almost looks like leather (but is really plastic). It would also be great for traveling because of the small size. This is super easy to operate and works extremely well. I definitely recommend this steamer!",

                "reviewText": "I actually got this small iron to keep in the garage and intend to use it for edge banding and other projects. I think it's the perfect size for this use where a standard-sized Iron might be overkill.I think the main thing that might work against this iron for that use case is that the bottom of the iron is not really flat and has some molded grooves to spread out the steam. Since I don't plan to use it all that often to apply steam, this is not of benefit to me personally but I can see how useful actually is when ironing clothing or other fabric as I've used traditional irons before where the steam is concentrated right around the holes and leaves damp spots.I tested this iron out for edge banding and it does ok but I did notice that there are no temperature controls. The temperature of the surface gets to around 140 degrees Celsius which is around 285 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm rounding those numbers as there is some fluctuation in the temp. I will need to take care as to not burn or discolor wood veneers as wood can begin to darken above 150 degrees Fahrenheit. I did test it out with white melamine banding and it worked as expected.There is no power switch so it is on as long as it is plugged in. While this is not uncommon with irons, it does prevent a hazard. It does come with a base to set the iron in that has silicone nubs to keep the surface of the iron raised. This worked ok but being that the iron is so light, I found that the weight of the cord made the iron set in the holder slightly askew (worse so if the handle is unfolded) and I worry a bit about it falling. I might try to rig up some sort of frame around the base that provides a little more support if I end up using this in my shop as I had planned.As I suspected, the grooves did provide a minor annoyance to me in that the iron doesn't always glide smoothly over a hard, narrow surface. It did not prevent me from using it successfully, though, and I got good results.I think with care, I can make use of this in my shop. I know it is not the intended purpose of the iron but it is the ideal size for such work.",

This could be handy in a hotel room when you want to get moving. I also appreciate that the iron doesn't have the issue of sticking to clothes. It\u2019s a smooth and efficient ironing experience.The iron has a limited number of steam holes, and they are concentrated near the center. Initially, I was concerned that this might affect its effectiveness, but surprisingly, it performs well. The steam distribution seems adequate, and it effectively removes wrinkles from clothing.If I\u2019m going out of town on business, I\u2019ll pack this iron.

                "reviewText": "Here is a possible product review based on the information on this page:I bought this portable mini ironing machine for my recent trip and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. It is very easy to use and heats up quickly. It can also be used as a regular iron or a steamer, depending on your needs. Here are some pros and cons of this product:Pros:-The iron is small enough to fit in a backpack, and it doesn't weigh much. It is perfect for travel or small spaces.-You can use it as an iron or a steamer by turning on or off the steam switch. It works well on different types of fabrics and clothes, and it removes wrinkles effectively.Cons:- The product description claims that the ironing machine has a non-stick alloy panel, but I found that some fabrics did stick to it, especially when using the steam function. You have to be careful not to burn your clothes or damage the panel.- This iron has only one temperature setting, which is 302\u00b0F. This might be too hot for some delicate fabrics, or too low for some thick fabrics.This steamer / iron is a good travel solution for touch ups, just be careful with it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this order on time with no issue. This little portable iron is so cute and it gives off vintage vibes. It looks elegant and small enough to pack in bags or suitcases. Its a steam iron and come with a small plastic cup to refill with water. It also comes with a plastic cover to place when it hot which is convenient for me since I have a habit of placing it down when its hot and end up burning the surface.I tried this out on some shirts and it heats up quickly and irons very nicely. This iron is portable and convenient to carry around and works great.",
