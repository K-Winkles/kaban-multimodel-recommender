My go to for testing is my linen shirts. The iron heats up very quickly and does an impressive job of minimizing the wrinkles. Love that it is 1000 watts of power! Then I gave it the true test..steam. Very effective! For such a little guy..I was impressed. It doesn\u2019t have a zillion steam vents and doesn\u2019t need them.Definitely travel size. It\u2019s compact and comes with a drawstring bag which is a nice touch. Not crazy about the resting plate being plastic\u2026..and it IS noisy, but not a deal breaker.Only had it a day but this baby won\u2019t be going back!",

                "reviewText": "This is great! I ironed with it at home just to test it, and it did a really good job for such a lightweight iron. The steam is impressive, and the tank is a decent size. This is a fantastic travel iron and steamer. We are taking a trip soon, and this is already in my stack for packing. My other one is going in the donation pile. This iron took wrinkles out of a cotton hang-dry top, and as a steamer, it took wrinkles out of a polyester/rayon-type skirt. My only reason for deducting a star is that you can't rest it anywhere to rotate your clothing on the ironing board. You can only put it plate-side down or on its side. It really needs a design where it can stand on its own or some way to rotate the handle like a kickstand or something. You almost need one extra hand to be able to turn your clothes and hold the iron at the same time. I just put it down for a couple seconds, turned the clothes a little, picked up, turned, etc., until I finally got them into the next ironing position. Not convenient. This is only a problem for ironing, not steaming.",

My sister's OCD bf tried it and said, \"send that to your sister! We need that!\" Having to use the stand is a bit annoying, but the product is worth it. It does it's job well both as an iron and steam iron.",
