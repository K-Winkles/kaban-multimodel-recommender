                "reviewText": "Update: 12/27/21Well... it finally needs to be replaced. The steam function is in some kind of overdrive and can't be turned off and I'm sure it will start leaking soon. If I didn't need the steam function, I guarantee this will still work. I'm upgrading back to 5 stars because I paid under $25 bucks and it lasted 7 years. That's not bad! Already ordered the exact same iron before updating this review. 3 photos are after 7 years of use.Update: 8/5/2018The rarely used spray button popped off. Looking at the button, it seems defective when made. One side of the plastic clamp is thin and flimsy and not symmetrical. It cracked while attached to the iron from the inside and would have given out over time. I found it on the floor and hadn't even noticed it missing on the iron. Now a big hole. It would be nice if B&D sent me a replacement spray button to snap in. Downgrading from 5 to 3 stars.Update: 8/17/2016This thing still works great over a year and a half later. I use distilled or bottled water in it, very rarely do I use tap water in any iron that I own. I iron the area/garment I need to iron and place the iron in a resting upright position, and I don't use any ironing accessories or gadgets other than the ironing board. I have used Proctor, Rowenta, Sunbeam, and Shark irons. B&D is the best in my opinion which lasts forever and takes a beating. NEVER BUY A NON-STICK IRON... ever ever ever ever! Stainless steel is the way to go, and I wouldn't purchase an iron with any type of digital anything or excessive controls.Original Review:Purchased Jan 26th, 2015 - Had it for 2 months so far and Zero Problems. My last B&D Iron I purchased from Walmart in 2005 lasted 10 years! (it did take a couple of exchanges to get a good one). At year 8, it started leaking occasionally while ironing, but I learned not to leave the iron down too long... and it lasted another two years before the leaking got out of control. Honestly, I wanted to see how long it would last, and wanted to use it until it broke, but I couldn't it take it anymore. I would iron Officer Uniforms 5 days a week non-stop for at least 300 days a year, and I use the Steam button heavily. When the Iron is not on a garment, it is in the upright position.I considered other brands, even consumer reports recommendations. This one was not recommended and I bet it will do just fine.",
