                "reviewText": "This iron works well, I have used it several times now, on both dry and steam and it works well on all settings. The only thing I found slightly annoying is the dial is very easy to bump when you pick it up so I find myself constantly having to re-adjust the setting almost every time I pick it up. The dial turns a little to easily, if it had more resistance in the design of it then me bumping it all the time would go away.The iron is a good weight, not to heavy not to light. It puts out a respectable amount of heat and steam when required. I stood and ironed 20 shirts last night, I used the high steam setting and I did all of them on a single tank of water. This iron has a big water tank, even the aperture to pour the water in is large, which is great, makes it much easier to fill it up quickly.The iron comes with a film protecting the mirror like ironing plate, so do not forget to peel that off before you turn it on the first time. The only thing on this iron that does feel cheap is the water tanks clear lid, it is very cheap, it is barely holding onto the body of the iron with 2 very tiny hinges that I suspect will break in time. So when you are handling this part, be very gentle with it to ensure it lasts longer.The irons water tank had a strange residue in it, I took a photo so you can see it clearly. I had to wash out the water tank several times to get all that gunk out. I think the water they used to test these irons before they left the factory was very dirty. So be aware that you may need to spend a few minutes rinsing the water tank out before using it for the first time.This iron is decent, it will do the job well enough, it is not a high end iron and it is not a cheap iron either. If you are looking for a good budget iron that will not burn your clothes or break down after one use then this iron will meet your needs well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fairly simple stream iron, it is 1800 watts and is comparable to the multitude of irons in the $30 - $50 price range. There are easy-to-reach thumb buttons to give a manual forward spritz of water or a quick downward burst of steam for the stubborn creases. Generally the burst is most effective, but for those hard-to-reach areas like between the buttons on a dress shirt, the spritz is handy. I did find that my fingers were brushing against the temperature dial, which is located on the main body underneath the handle, but I have very large hands. The power cord is about 6 feet long, and is robust.Overall, the iron does its job perfectly fine. It heats up quick and has water capacity for maybe 5 shirts. Word of advice when you are unpackaging, be careful when peeling off the protective plastic from the heating element. I noticed that little bits of plastic were torn off and left around the perimeter. Had I not caught those and removed them, they would\u2019ve burned onto the iron, and probably created a bunch of smoke.",

                "reviewText": "My wife has gone through three Rowenta and one Sunbeam steam irons over the years and she likes this no-name OSTBA iron quite a bit. It heats up quickly, the controls are logical, and the steam and spray dispensers work just like they should. The controls are quite logical and intuitive, which is good, because the manual (two sheets of double-sided printer paper stapled into a booklet) is not particularly well written and has several errors in it.The iron feels light and weighs two pounds, not including the cord. That compares to 2.7 pounds for a comparably sized Rowenta iron. The base plate is a mirror finished stainless steel. It does not have a non-stick surface, but my wife did not have any problems with spray sizing sticking to it. The cord is shorter than my wife would have liked at only seventy-five inches, compared to ninety-six inches for the average steam iron. You'll have to be close to an electrical outlet or use an extension cord rated for thirteen amps or more.The steam iron is listed as using 1800 watts, but testing with a Watt meter reveals it actually uses 1380 watts with the heating element on. At the highest (cotton/linen) setting, the plate heats up to between 370-380\u00b0 F at the tip, and 270-286\u00b0 F at the base. At the lowest (synthetic) setting, the tip heats up to between 150-160\u00b0 F.Although my wife thinks this iron is great, I can't give it a full five stars due to the short cord and the fact that I can't verify that it has an ETL listing. Although there is an ETL listing label stuck on the iron, I could not find a steam iron listed under the brand (OSTBA) or model number (WSD-428) on ETL's directory of listed products. The only product ETL has listed under the OSTBA brand is a meat grinder. That could be because this product is too new to be listed, or this iron could have a counterfeit listing. As with any no-name product on Amazon, caveat emptor.",

That's my favorite part. Some combo packs/devices like this have a little leakage but this holds really well. Heats up quickly so when you're in a rush, it keeps up with you. The cord could be longer, but also at the same time, you don't want too long of a cord because trip hazards become more present and you also don't want this falling onto your animals, kids, etc., because again, this heats up fast.

                "reviewText": "The YASHE brand steam iron for clothing is a full-size, fully featured and powerful 1800 W device designed to add ease-of-use to the mostly dreaded but often kill me necessary chore of ironing clothing. Multiple operating modes and options allow the user to select the desired settings for maximum ironing effectiveness. The iron is self-cleaning and does not require distilled water accordingly.Built-in safety features include an automatic 30 second shut off if the iron is left in the horizontal position or tipped, and an 8 minute shut off if the iron is left unattended in the upright position. Despite extensive use of lightweight plastic construction materials, this iron packs considerable heft weighing approximately 1 kg, and approximately 1.5 kg when used with a full super-tanker sized water reservoir holding 400 mL of water to feed both the frontal spray feature, and the nicely spaced 16 steam outlets located in a flying geese V formation on the shiny stainless steel base plate (picture attached).The iron receives power through a generous 190 cm (6 foot) long power cord with a standard two prong 110 V power source plug at one end, while at the other end, a thoughtfully designed and reinforced flexible silicone guide sheath designed to mitigate bending fatigue where the power wire enters the main body of the iron (picture attached).The guide sheath is angled upward and rear facing to assist with the task of ensuring the power cord does not make contact with the hot iron when in use (picture attached). The superfast cold to hot transforming 1800 W heating system is on par with the most powerful and expensive premium irons, however this unit is attractively priced in the lower quartile of peer products.A 2 inch diameter circular dial located on top of the water reservoir and under the handle of the iron provides pinpoint precision temperature adjustment with dozens of available increments, each held in place by a nicely calibrated and audible click and lock system. The size diameter of the handle should be comfort appropriate for the majority of hand sizes. A series of 5 slightly raised but inconspicuous corduroy ribs on top of the handle provide additional traction and grip for the user (picture attached).A forward facing thumb pump plunger trigger on the top of the iron handle controls both the spray and steam functions (picture attached). The front tip of the iron protrudes slightly to accommodate pinpoint precision ironing points such as around buttons or other obstacles (picture attached).When put to the test, this iron was fairly simple and easy to use. This reviewer soon developed confidence in both the navigation and guidance of the iron, and the desirable temperature range for the fabric and task at hand. The slippery Teflon like stainless steel base assured low friction gliding efforts while working the iron. Coordinating the spray and steam buttons while simultaneously maintaining ironing motion was the most challenging, but still achievable, part of the learning curve for this device.Conclusion: The YASHE brand steam iron is a full-size, fully featured and powerful 1800 W device to assist with the often dreaded but necessary chore of ironing clothing. This iron offers a generous price/value equation, especially for the features and performance metrics offered. An overall product score of 5/5 is assigned accordingly.",

The iron has aself-clean option which by turning the dial to the hottest temperature and pressing the self-clean a very hot steam will come out and along with it a lot of small calcareous build up from inside the iron.My iron had some condensation inside and I am sure other people had this also, however this is clearly mentioned in the product listing as it is only a sign of the fact that the item has been quality tested beforehand, therefore I am actually glad to find this in my iron as it is proof that it is an item which has been tested and it is safe to use.I am getting easy ironing with the help of this steam iron, which has some good settings for different types of fabrics and great auto shut off safety feature.",

It has a larger water tank than I am used to and love this feature. I can get through quite a few items before I run out of water. The only thing that is a negative is the cord, you pretty much have to have the ironing board very close to your plug-in to ensure you have enough length to reach the end of the board. The cord on my last iron was twice as long. With the configuration of my sewing room, I would prefer that the cord on this model be longer than it is. They have described it as being extra long, but I disagree, so have docked it one star because of that.",

                "reviewText": "I'm happy enough with this iron. It's not perfect, with the cable being a little on the short side, and the iron not being as heavy in weight as I'd like, but it more than does the job. It heats up well, and quickly, and you can choose between different temperature settings. It also doesn't have the tendency to stick to clothes that some do.One of my main concerns when it comes to irons is safety. I've always had a (probably irrational) fear that I might forget to turn the iron off, and through some unlikely sequence of events it would lead to the worst outcome. Thankfully, this one puts my fears to rest, as it automatically shuts itself off after a few minutes - to some, this is a nice-to-have, but for me it's an essential.One odd thing I did notice was that on unboxing the iron, there was already some condensation and visible drops of water inside the water tank, as though it had been filled before. Perhaps this is part of the quality assurance process, but it's not something you expect to find when unpacking a new product.On the whole, however, I'm happy with this. It does the primary thing I'd want an iron to do - effectively removes creases from my clothes.",

                "reviewText": "I got this iron from Yashe to replace an older one and I am happy to say that this affordable steam iron works well! It is a basic iron but its powerful steam output and smooth steel plate ensures it gets wrinkles out of my thickest clothes with ease.The iron is mostly made of plastic so it is lighter than most irons made of stronger materials. It still has a solid feel to it. I like the look of it despite its plastic design. There is a plastic cover over the water reservoir opening. The reservoir is the highlight of this iron, as it is absolutely massive. I ironed 4 pairs of jeans, 4 thick winter sweaters and various smaller t-shirts, and there was still plenty of water in the tank. This despite the very powerful steam output. I do find that the steel soleplate gets hot, but not entirely as hot as my hold iron. However this has no impact on the wrinkles as this iron worked perfectly on my jeans and thick sweaters. The soleplate glides smoothly on all of the types of clothes that I tried, particularly on my jeans. It removed the wrinkles on the freshly-washed jeans without any extra effort compared to my older, more expensive iron. It easily handled t-shirts and sweaters. The dial to adjust the temperature is the typical dial found underneath the handle. The iron has an anti-shut off of 30 seconds when tipped over, or 8 minutes when vertical. There is a burst steam button and a spray button. The spray is a bit weak and needs a few pumps before it gets going, but it does the job. I have not needed the burst button yet since the regular steam output is strong. There is also a self-cleaning button.I definitely recommend this affordable, no-frills iron as it just plain works.",
