I choose this iron because I couldn't find a smaller size iron with a trusted brand name . there were several small irons here on Amazon , but a lot of out of country brands I have never heard of or heard about so I went with what I trust is good quality and is durable. I know this iron will work forever.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this iron because it appeared to be the same as the one that I previously owned. It's not. It's difficult to fill with water as the opening is small and it drips water when you are ironing at the lower settings; and the reservoir is only 1/3rd full. The manual said there was a fabric guide on Page 8...there is no fabric guide. The previous version had it printed right on the iron. There's no light to indicate it is on. Black and Decker cheapened this iron to the point of barely functional. Time to look for a different brand!",
