And let me say that back in the \"olden days\" I used to even have an ironing business (when I was in my early teens) for people in my neighborhood, so I know how to handle an iron! LOL We ironed everything in my home: shirts, pants, curtains, pillowcases. So.....What I love about it:The weight. It's not too heavy but it's heavy enough. Too light of an iron won't do the job well.The steam is fantastic. When turned up to the highest setting it really puts it out.The quickness of heat-up....one word: seconds. Boom.No drips, no weird water marks. Ever. (Those are deal breakers to me)What I don't love:Non-retractable cord. I know, I'm lazy.The location of the steam adjustment. Inevitably I accidentally turn it down (or off) while I'm ironing.Bottom line: Do not waste your money on a different iron. This one is THE BOMB. No drips, no splatters, amazing steam, perfect weight, great soleplate (stainless and smoooooth), excellent ability to get around buttons and in pleats with the ridge around the point....it's just a fantastic iron and an amazing price.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded from the Sunbeam Model 4214 Series S iron which served me well for years (with built in cord storage).I don't understand the negative reviews I see for this iron. Works great for me.This unit gets hotter, faster than my old one. The soleplate is larger which is nice. The cord is longer and has the swivel connection point which works great in my view. (it was always a pain to get the cord to fully retract on the other one anyway).This unit has a cleaning button/feature (which I haven't used yet.)I find the water reservoir cover to be a better design and I've experienced no leaks yet, even with overfilling.And the steam function is MUCH better than my older Sunbeam model.As for the ceramic soleplate, I'm not sure it is worth more money compared to non-stick, but performs just as well, no better in my view.And it has all the auto-off features as you would expect.I can't speak for durability, I have only used it for 2 weeks, but I see nothing to complain about.I would pay full price for this on amazon but, full disclosure, I bought it during the recent President's Day sale, so it was even a better bargain.I would buy this iron again and recommend it highly.",

                "reviewText": "This iron is by far the best product for the very reasonable price. Ive recently used 3 other irons that were all dissapointing in one way or anaother but this iron is the all around total package. The look alone is vern cool abd it performes extreamly well, its not too heavy, it erases wrinkles with ease, it sets creases, steams, sprays, works vertical, and has auto off safety feature for the attention challenged individuals. The water tank is super easy to fill and empty. It has a auto clean function wich prolongs life and will save you money and frustration. Best of all it heats up super quick and glides over any material really smootly. This iron rules which is saying alot since im not one to get to excited about ironing but if i have to do it i sure as heck want to use this iron.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Finally, a Sexy Iron!!",
                "reviewText": "If you love the LOOK of this iron (the analog version), with its vibrant turquoise sole plate, treat yourself. It's the rare SEXY iron!!If looks matter to you, you'll SMILE every time you have to iron, and that little bit of cheer makes up for some small problems. Here's what you might NOT love so much:1. You cannot fill the steam reservoir without laying the iron flat. That's fine when starting your ironing, but for refills, count on making a mess, as you try to hold the iron level to the board (but not touching the board), while pouring water with the other hand.The problem is the hinged COVER over the water fill hole. It hinges at the pointy end of the iron, and has no catch, so if your iron is resting upright on its end, that little cover won't stay open, and you can't fill it with water. It will only stay open if the iron is laying FLAT. A SIMPLE FIX would have been to hinge the cover at the BOTTOM. You can adapt, as I have, or remove the cover, as I considered doing! See my photos.2. The temperature setting DIAL is very detailed, and sits fully underneath the handle, so if you have a smaller hand, it may be hard to move the dial without removing your hand from the handle. I think the idea was that while holding the handle of the iron, you could reach thumb and fingers around the edge of the dial to adjust it. With my smaller size hand, I must shift my hand to reach under the handle and turn the dial with the flat of my thumb. I wouldn't mind this much if I didn't have to deal with problem #3...3. The icons and print on the dial are DIFFICULT to READ, if you are over 40. And really...does anybody UNDER 40 iron?4. The iron turns itself off too quickly if \"not being used.\" This is a real downer if I am sewing and ironing as I go. This adds much wasted time to my sewing/ironing routine. Quilters and crafters may find this crazy-making.+ + + On the PLUS side, well, there's that TURQUOISE NON-STICK SOLE PLATE! It's gorgeous and it's truly non-stick.1. The iron takes tap water.2. It self-cleans.3. There is a \"steam/no steam\" switch above the handle, which allows you to switch between steam and dry, without missing a beat.4. The spray option works pretty well.5. The sole plate has yet to need any cleaning, even though I've ironed over plastic and the wrong sides of iron-on patches. I've ironed over buttons and pins, and the sole plate is scratch-resistant.6. The weight of the iron is correct. Not too heavy, not too light. The balance of the iron in the hand is just right, and is non-fatiguing.7. The price is lower than that of comparable irons, and all materials in the iron seem to be of high quality.Even with the small annoyances, this tool looks sharp and does what it needs to do, for the occasional user, or the pro.It is a VERY GOOD IRON.Treat yourself to a new IRONING BOARD which is extra-WIDE with wings!https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ASR8WUO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
