The Electrolux is very similar to my previous iron and has a ceramic base plate too. It is the right weight, even when filled with water and so far, runs well.My previous iron had a retractable cord and this one does not which I also like because I believe, over time, the self retracting cord pulls on its connection to the iron internally and that connection is not accessible for tightening.",

When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised at the packaging. A nice, sturdy box housed the iron. Inside it said a box worth keeping. That was definitely well said. The box is almost as great as the iron. I wasn't paying much attention to the color of the iron since I was ordering for delivery speed and need. The iron is gorgeous. Black with rose gold highlights. It is a very solid iron with an extra long cord, which I love. The iron heats up quickly. The steam is pretty powerful. Overall, this is the best iron I've had in the past 10 years.",
