The iron is small enough to be light but not so small you can't finish a shirt. It heats fast and gives off a lot of steam. It only has 3 settings, low heat, medium heat with steam if you push the button and high heat with steam option. For my purposes this is perfect. I do occasional ironing, a few items at a time and I will also do mending or alterations sometimes. I find it's perfect for sewing. I set it up next to me and turn it on and off as needed because it heats so fast...no need to keep it on while I work. The ironing plate is 6 1/4 x 2 5/8. About as big as my cell phone. I find that big enough to iron clothes yet small enough to fit in folds. It's pretty too!",

I kept my old iron for occasions where I may need a more tapered point.To solve the plastic tray issue, I covered it with heavy duty foil and a small hand towel. Seems to have solved the problem.",

                "reviewText": "What a nice little iron. I love the look of it, which is why I bought it in the first place. Here is my experience:Pros: For a small iron it does the job just the same as those big ones from the store. The steamer is AMAZING! I was afraid the plastic resting pad would melt if I set the iron on it while it was hot, but no!Cons: It takes a while to cool down. I haven\u2019t traveled with it; however, I couldn\u2019t picture myself loading this into my luggage after using. It takes about 15-20mins to fully cool down. At home, once I\u2019m done using it I just put on it\u2019s resting pad and store it away. I don\u2019t have to worry about it cooling down quickly.Heads up:1. This iron does not rest like regular irons, you have to rest it face down on the ironing board or on it resting pad. Was a bit of an adjustment for me.2. It comes with a standard length cord that does not roll up. For me, I just wrap the cord around the body of the iron and store it away on its resting pad.UPDATE: 10/22/23Unfortunately today this iron just completely stopped working. Not sure why. I simply plugged it in as usual and it won't get hot anymore. Im not even going to bother reaching out to the seller because I purchased this back in January 2023. It just not even worth my time and effort. I won't be purchasing this item again. However, I loved this little portable iron. Too bad it gave out the way it did.",
