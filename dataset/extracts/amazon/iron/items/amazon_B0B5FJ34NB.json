This iron is a good weight and definitely feels high quality.Big water tank opening to fill with water makes it convenient. 3 position toggle light to heavy steam. The soleplate feels smooth and effortless over fabrics, but make sure the temperature is correct for each fabric. Temperature adjustments are clear and easy to use. The switch to turn on and off the useful and extremely unique headlight feature is on the heel of the iron.There is no leakage at all, which is rare and very much appreciated. The iron adjusts between temperatures quickly, especially when turning on and heating up. Very impressive in that regard.",
