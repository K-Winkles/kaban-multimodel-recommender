                "reviewText": "I had a gravity feed iron which I have used for years, and I broke (completely my fault). I was in the middle of several projects, and decided to take what I could get on Prime. This iron has been a real disappointment. The steam is very uneven. You press the button and nothing happens, then the next time you press the button it sputters and spits. I didn't even know a gravity feed iron COULD spit. Because there is no water in the iron itself, I've never had that happen. Also, the handle on this iron gets so hot that it burns you. One of the pluses of a gravity feed iron is that it doesn't have an automatic shut-off, so if you're sewing all day, you can leave it on and not have to wait for it to heat back up so you can press your seams. After being on about 30 minutes, you have be very careful where you touch the handle. If you don't have your hand way out at the end, you will burn yourself. As a man with fairly good sized hands, that's a problem. I have ordered a new iron like my previous iron (not on Amazon-they don't sell that brand) and will anxiously await its arrival. Can't wait to replace this, and terribly disappointed that its money down the drain.",
