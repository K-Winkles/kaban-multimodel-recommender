                "reviewText": "I bought this iron to tide me over while my Rowenta Steam Station is being repaired. I bought this model specifically because it was the only one I could find that did not have an automatic shutdown after eight minutes. For someone who sews a lot, this is a really annoying feature on an iron. This Proctor Silex stays on for an hour before it turns off, which is much better for sewers. The tank holds quite a bit of water, but on the downside, it is a bit difficult to fill with water. The shot of steam and spritzer are adequate, but the steam output is great. The heat control dial is very difficult to turn, but the highest heat setting is just fine for most fabrics.",

                "reviewText": "This iron is an upgrade from my previous Proctor Silex. Just love it. The automatic shut-off is fantastic as I get distracted sometimes while sewing. The water level goes down so much slower than my 1st one. Maybe it's larger with this one as I couldn't see my 1st model except for a small gauge on the side. No question about water level on this one. I highly, highly recommend this iron. It is soooo reasonably priced, too. (I have a Eurosteam, too.). This one is a must for a seamstress!",

                "reviewText": "Cord gets in the way, continuously! The iron will not sit up on the board, the cord gets in its way even when it is in a sitting! The design of the iron is really just a mess. Why would a control knob be hidden from the eyes, as well as very difficult to get to underneath the curved handle. The advertisement is way off! The water DOES leak, the steamer set position chooses when it will steam on it's own, not a good iron at all. My very first use, when I opened it up, I noticed the holes were all white?, so I ironed an old pillow case. took forever to get the milky looking water to a clean basis. Sure am glad I thought to look at the bottom side.On a positive note, the packaging/box was easy to open.",

                "reviewText": "When this was purchased I could have sworn I read somewhere in the description that it turns off after 30s laying down flat. Tested it just in case (as it\u2019s going into a rental property) and this did not happen. It started smoking at 3.5min laying flat as it burned a hole through a junk towel. Safety and constant monitoring was taken in testing this. Glad I tested this as it did not auto turn off when laying flat. Maybe it would have after an hour though I didn\u2019t want to take that risk. If you are looking for safety I suggest a different iron.",
