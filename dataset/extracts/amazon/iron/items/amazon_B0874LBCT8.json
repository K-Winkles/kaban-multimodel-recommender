                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hi. I just bought this Iron. Today we're using it for the first time. What's easy is that it apparently comes charged. But you won't know that unless you turn the dial to set the temperature to heat it up. And it heats up very fast. Also, you won't know what temperature you're setting unless you look at the BOTTOM of the dial to set the temperature, not the top. There is difficult to see translucent vertical rectangle that I suppose is what represents the marker for where you're setting the temperature. (None of this is in the manual by the way. Nothing.)Now that that's out of the way. The charging experience. Firstly, one would think, you'd get a chargeable iron, charge it the first time, and a light would come on to tell you it's charged. Then you'd take it out of the base and iron something. Then you'd put it back in the base, and charge it until next time. What's great is that, the Ad claims it charges up in 30 seconds. So, if you run out of charge while ironing because you have so many clothes to iron, you can just stop, charge, and get back to ironing.The only problem is WHERE IS THE INDICATOR THAT IT IS CHARGED. Check the video. You can barely see it. My girlfriend, who is a Nurse (and very detail oriented - because she has to check little bottles for dosages before giving them to patients or she could make them sick). I'm an IT guy. So, I'm detail-oriented. (And a relentless problem-solver.) It's a Wi-Fi looking light that won't light up unless it's charging. And unfortunately, it goes out when it's not charged, and seems to go out when it's fully charged.What would be obvious is: It comes out of the box. The instructions say put it in the base, switch the lock (it has one on the base) to the locking position so it won't fall out, and plug the base into the wall with the iron locked into it. Leave it over night. This would give it a maximum charge. At this point the light should immediately come on and be flashing amber. Telling you it's busy charging leave it alone. Then, in the morning when you check it, the light should be green. Telling it's ready. If ironing and the charge is getting low, the light should come on like a car fuel indicator. It should pop on as amber (a low charge indicator like a low fuel indicator). Then you'd know you only have so long left to iron until you have to put it back in the base.Then the question becomes how fast will it re-charge if you still have more close to iron. I could go on but I've given enough free advise. If this company wants to grow and sell these, they need a new manual. And easier than that is to actually give this out to at least one person who is technical that can write in plain English (if you're selling to America then it's American English), and let them take it home and tell you all their problems. Then go back and let someone who used it write a draft of the manual. Then get a professional writer who writes manuals to write on that tells us all how to use this thing if it's a great as you say. Otherwise, all of your innovation may go completely missed.Go to your investors and tell them your customers said do just redo the manual. (And in the next version work on the lighting and probably relocate the charging indicator if that's not too troublesome, but honestly, you don't if you just have a good manual.",

It is best to recharge by putting it back to the station whenever possible during the ironing to keep it hot (as oppose to letting it stand somewhere else while you adjust the clothes). One thing that really bothers me at the beginning was no clear instructions on how to turn it on (you have to actually use the dial to select the right temperature before you put it on the station to get it charged; otherwise the light just doesn\u2019t get \u201con\u201d).Thankful there is a helpful review that does the work for this company otherwise I couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen to all of those that doesn\u2019t know why they design it this way.All in all it does a good job once I get used to it, and given the price I would say it is a good bargain. However the user manual should definitely be improved.",
