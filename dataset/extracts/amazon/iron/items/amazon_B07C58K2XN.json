I didn\u2019t time it but I would guess 15-20 minutes. If you were ironing clothes that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Great color (rose gold) and nice ceramic bottom. Handy removable water container too. I would definitely buy again. Took it straight to a craft retreat with me and heard several ladies talking about how they wanted one when it was time to replace theirs.",

Does not seem to hold a high heat very long even as I am using for thirty minutes and setting it back in the cradle every minute or two. I am only using for quilting and not adding water for steam so not sure about that. Love not having a cord to drag over the pieced blocks. I think I like it but after only a couple of weeks not sure. It does take several minutes to heat back up when put back in the cradle after a few minutes or ironing. If anyone else has a better heat and hold time let us all know. Maybe just this one.",

I use it at my sewing table for seams as I\u2019m piecing quilt tops. It\u2019s very light weight but the sole plate is heavy enough to do the job. The temperatures are just right for ironing different fabrics. It does not leak. The design of the sole plate makes it so amazing to iron with. More useful and easier to maneuver through seams than any quilting iron I have ever owned. I am impressed and very happy that I finally own one! It\u2019s the only iron I will ever use now.

                "reviewText": ".Product Review: Panasonic IronI recently purchased the Panasonic Iron for my wife, who is an avid quilter. After hearing positive feedback about it from another quilter who had no vested interest in promoting the product, I decided to search for it myself. Initially, it was sold out on Amazon, but through some diligent searching, I managed to find it available for $89. Since then, I have observed the price fluctuating between $149 and $169, which I believe is due to supply and demand factors.My wife has used the Panasonic Iron several times, and she wholeheartedly agrees with the sentiments expressed by the other quilter. According to her, this iron has made her quilting tasks much easier and more efficient. Here are a few key points that have impressed us about the Panasonic Iron:Performance: The iron's performance has been exceptional. It heats up quickly and maintains a consistent temperature throughout its use. This feature is crucial for quilters, as they often require precise and even heat distribution to achieve professional-looking results.Steam Functionality: The steam function on this iron is highly effective. It produces a strong, continuous steam output, which helps to remove stubborn wrinkles and creases from fabric. The ability to adjust the steam settings according to the fabric type provides added convenience and control.Durability: The Panasonic Iron appears to be well-built and durable. It feels sturdy in hand and has shown no signs of wear or malfunction after multiple uses. This durability is essential, especially for individuals like my wife who engage in frequent quilting projects.Ease of Use: The iron's design and layout make it user-friendly. The buttons and controls are intuitively placed, and the iron glides smoothly over the fabric, making it easy to maneuver. Its lightweight nature also contributes to a comfortable and effortless ironing experience.While the price of the Panasonic Iron has increased since my initial purchase, I believe it is due to market demand rather than greed. The positive experiences shared by quilters and the improvements my wife has witnessed in her quilting process make it a worthwhile investment for anyone involved in such activities.In conclusion, the Panasonic Iron has proven to be a valuable addition to my wife's quilting toolkit. Its impressive performance, reliable steam functionality, durability, and overall ease of use have made a noticeable difference in the quality and efficiency of her quilting projects. If you can find it at a reasonable price, I highly recommend considering the Panasonic Iron for your quilting needs.",

It's taken her some time to get used to placing the iron in its charger holder. She says it's a bit smaller than her old irons, but lightweight, heats fast and holds the heat. And no more cords to get in the way!",
