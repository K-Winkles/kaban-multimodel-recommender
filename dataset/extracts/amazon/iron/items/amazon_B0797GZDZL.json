Just as fueling activity is important, so is the importance of maximizing recovery from that activity. Implementing an effective recovery strategy involves accounting for the metabolic demands of training, rehydrating, and supporting recovery from injury. Many Thorne products offer healthy supplementation to meet these needs.

Better ingredients means better potency, absorption, and digestibility - and ultimately better health. Manufacturing the Right Way We manufacture our own products to ensure full supply chain transparency. For more than 30 years, we have invested in clean manufacturing practices. We refuse to use ingredients that can inhibit absorption. We perform our final production in the United States. Our Charleston, SC facility is third-party certified. Four Rounds of Testing We perform four rounds of testing for each product we manufacture \u2013 far above the industry standard. Thorne has invested in two state-of-the-art in-house laboratories that enable us to conduct four rounds of testing, including raw material testing, in-process batch testing, finished product testing, and expiration date stability testing for each lot of product that we manufacture. Thinking Sustainably We're thinking sustainably to protect our environment. We believe the environment should never be compromised for the sake of business gain. At Thorne, we believe that doing our part to protect the environment and its most valuable resources goes hand in hand with our product quality standards.",

I learned that iron absorption from supplements is highest if taken on alternate days -- so I take 1 iron pill every other day. Thorne's iron pills are easy on the stomach and I haven't experienced any of the digestive discomfort typically associated with iron supplements. They also seem to be effective, as I've noticed an increase in my energy levels. I highly recommend these for anyone who needs to supplement their iron intake, but has had trouble with other brands in the past.",

                "reviewText": "This review might be a little long winded but some of you might be in the same boat as me, and I really wanna help you, because it is terrifying losing your hair! I went vegan for about 5 years and then vegetarian over the last year because I really like cheese and eggs. I wasn't paying attention to how much protein I was taking or how much iron I was getting. I was always a bit of a shedder, as I have long, gorgeous thick wavy hair. It occurred to me one day when I started losing a small handful of hair a day, that I might be shedding too much. I remembered a girl who told me she was a militant vegan for 12 years and then she started losing her hair. Her doctor had her eat mainly red meat and orange juice for a couple of months. She grew her hair back and stopped being vegan. Well, I happen to love being a vegetarian and I don't really wanna eat meat again. So I read somewhere to check your iron. Unfortunately, you have to go to a doctor which I do not want to do EVER. So thankfully I found out that to test if you have low iron, you can take a pure gold ring and rub it on your cheek. If you are low in iron your skin will get blueish there and leave a streak. Well, thankfully I had a gold ring and I did just that and it left a streak. I went online and found this iron supplement that had the highest ranking. I didn't care that it was heme iron. If absorbs better...great! I took that and vitamin C to absorb it and stayed away from coffee and eggs several hours away from taking my iron supplement, as that makes it hard to absorb the iron. A month and a half goes by and I'm still losing hair rapidly. I still had a lot of hair, but it felt thinner, like I had lost about 15 to 20%. Noooooo! I finally bit the bullet and bought some buffalo burgers. Two burgers a week with orange juice and an iron pill once a day and a month later the hair stopped falling out. I'm also making sure I get about 80 grams of protein a day taking organic protein shakes. I've cut back to one burger a week and my hair is falling out less then it ever did. Like maybe I'll lose one hair instead of a bunch every time I run my fingers though all the ends. I'm taking an iron pill every other day now because I am also cooking out of an iron pot as well as eating iron rich foods and I don't want too much iron in my blood, cause that can cause problems too. Thankfully, women bleed every month, so I probably shouldn't worry about getting too much iron. Eventually I'll wean myself off the burgers completely and stick with my reprimand. For now I'm very happy with this supplement. I don't get any side effects at all.",
