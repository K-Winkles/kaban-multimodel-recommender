                "reviewText": "I purchased this travel iron for a trip to Spain and Italy. It does NOT come with a converter plug so you must purchase a converter in order to use this in other countries. Besides the fact that it needs a converter plug to work, it is a GREAT little iron. I didn\u2019t want to mess with distilled water and a liquid mess in my luggage so I didn\u2019t use a steamer or the steamer feature of the iron but this iron worked beautifully dry. It heats up quickly and is easy to use without an ironing board which is not always available when traveling. It is very lightweight and takes up very little space in luggage. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I spend 2 to 5 hours a day sewing masks. When arthritis attacked my hands it became quite painful to work beyond an hour using my old trusty tailoring iron that I\u2019ve used for years and years, but when I bought this little travel iron, once again I could sew as many hours a day as I wanted/needed to. I haven\u2019t weighed it but it isn\u2019t any heavier than my cell phone, and the handle is configured so I don\u2019t even have to grip it like a teakettle (as I do to hold the big one) but can hook it with 2 fingers if I want. The plate is shaped exactly the same as the shape of the masks, and being small, it fits into the crannies where the large iron doesn\u2019t. The 2nd photo shows you the size difference in the two irons.I love this little iron! I don\u2019t mind that I have to refill it often as the water vessel doesn\u2019t hold much, it provides ample steam when I want it. And the range of heat is just as good as the big iron. The only caveat is something I read about in the reviews before I bought it, that\u2019s the short life. I know it\u2019s meant as a travel iron, not to be used 2 to 5 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I was prepared to replace it in about a year, but no, it only lasted 3 months and 12 days after delivery - 2 months and 13 days after the return deadline. This morning it was totally unresponsive. So today, after making one mask using the big, 20 lb iron, I bit the bullet and ordered another sweet little workhorse. At this price I'll just consider it a subscription item that makes it possible for me to keep up the pace making my masks.",
