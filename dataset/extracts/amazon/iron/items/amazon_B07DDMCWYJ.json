It is lightweight, heats quickly and delivers great amount of steam. I especially liked how easy it is to fill and the water level is easy to see in the water tank. Appreciated the tip about watching the cord when standing on the heel, but easy to do a quick check and I didn\u2019t find it to be a problem. I don\u2019t know anyone who likes to iron, but this one definitely makes it easier.",
