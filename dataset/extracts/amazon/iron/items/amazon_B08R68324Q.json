                "reviewText": "I have had problems donating plasma and I knew I needed something to get my iron up since it has always been lower than the acceptable 38 hematocrit level. What I liked about this is I could take this before bed with no side effects and then again in the morning. It did take, as online said it would, approximately 3 weeks to raise the level because I tried after 1 week and my hematocrit was 35 and had to wait on donating. I take a off brand of 5 Hour Energy, and it is true that caffeine can mess with iron absorption so I wake up & take this pill on an empty stomach and wait 2 hours minimum before taking any caffeine. On donating days I don't touch caffeine until after donating. Here's some additional advice: for extra absorption take vitamin A and B12 with this pill and DON'T TAKE CALCIUM UNTIL MINIMUM 2 HOURS LATER (same suggestion when eating meals to absorb iron). You can also cook on cast iron pans to make more iron rich food but it didn't seem to work as well as these pills. I take 1 in the morning and 1 at night everyday on an empty stomach. On donating days I wake up and eat an iron rich breakfast of a 2 egg omelet with no cheese (remember no calcium!) with mixed in tomatoes, red peppers, and broccoli. Then an hour and a half when I'm leaving my home to go donate I take 2-3 of these pills and my hematocrit was 39! I strongly suggest testing any new iron pills you buy by trying during the day to see how your body reacts. I bought a different iron pill and a liquid iron, had them both on an empty stomach before going to bed, and my heart raced all night! All I know is these pills do not do that to me plus there's vitamin c for extra absorption so I just got done buying some more. I also take as many as I do because I fast and then eat on my donation days and it does drop my already low iron even lower so I need more, but PLEASE don't just take as many as I am taking if you're unsure or are not getting your hematocrit tested because you don't want iron overload.",
