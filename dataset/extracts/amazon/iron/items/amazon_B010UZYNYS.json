                "reviewText": "Overall I am satisfied with the product even i faced a major problem.The problem was that it stopped working after 35 days. This was a big disappointment because i was over 5 days of my 30 days return time. Amazon refused to accommodate and they asked me to contact the vendor. And contacting the vendor for warranty was another big hassle, after almost 20 calls i was able to take hold of someone who was actually responsible of handling warranty claims.At first she asked me to pay $12 as delivery charges for a $19 Iron but then she realized it is not fair so she sent replacement of my iron in warranty free of cost.Masha Allah, it is working fine since then.Update: The Iron again gone bad at the end of December 2023. Since it was in the warranty so i contacted them again for the warranty claim. They accepted the claim and like the last time they asked to pay delivery charges but after the same argument they waived off the delivery charges.Since it has gone bad two times during the warranty so the quality is not so good. The edge is it is under warranty so got it replaced.Now Overall i am not satisfied with the performance/ quality.Suggestion: Simplify your warranty procedure.",

                "reviewText": "I like how the pointed end is rounded off, no more driving into seams when I'm feeling energetic!The safety feature! An unusual story that turns out well.One time I used it, it would not heat up though the light was on. I tried many times. Then I saw a bug crawling on it. Honestly, I think he had been inside exploring. I captured and put him outside the house. The following day I used the iron as usual and it was perfect.Happy the bug benefitted from the safety feature (though I do not know how he fared outside) and my new iron did not get ruined!",
