                "reviewText": "There seem to be a lot of bad reviews, but I took a chance since my purpose for purchasing this iron was not for ironing or crafts. I\u2019ve been replacing the windows in my home and the wood veneer all around one of the frames was in really bad shape so I purchased some wood edge banding with a hot glue backing. You place the banding where you want it \u2013 normally the edge of a counter or shelf \u2013 and then run an iron over it to heat the glue underneath and it holds fast. The banding was perfect for the window, but my iron was way too big to fit in there to heat it up. This iron fit perfectly. I slowly ran it up and down the banding until the heated glue held it on tight. My methods worked like a charm and you wouldn\u2019t know there was ever any damage to the window frame.A number of reviews complain about the removable cord coming out of the iron, but I didn\u2019t have that problem. It does have issues staying upright should you set it down so you have to be careful there. Especially since there is no power switch and no auto off. If you leave it and forget it and it falls over\u2026 Many say it didn\u2019t heat up enough for their purposes. Could be. I don\u2019t know. I do know that I would hate to have to try and iron a shirt with this tiny iron. I might have to admit that it may not get as hot as my regular iron, but it was certainly hot enough to burn me. It did provide sufficient heat for gluing down the edge banding and turned out to be the perfect tool for this use. There are vent holes in the front of the iron to vent off excessive heat. I imagine this little iron might get too hot to handle without them. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll ever use this iron for again, but I\u2019ll stash it away in case it\u2019s needed. This iron did the job I needed it to do and I\u2019m satisfied with my purchase.Oh, and I was careful to follow the instructions on the sticker stuck to the iron. \"Do not immerse in any liquid.\" Glad they told me. :-D Reminds me of the warning once found on an electric heating pad. \"Do not apply directly to skin or clothing.\" \u00ac_\u00ac",

Well it doesn\u2019t get hot and is barely warm with so little heat it doesn\u2019t get wrinkles out of anything. I can put my hand flush to the bottom even after I let it \u201cheat\u201d for 15 minutes. It is not worth buying. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t open the plastic container until yesterday so it\u2019s too late to return and get credit for it. I\u2019ll toss it or use as a paperweight but it sure can\u2019t be used to iron or get wrinkles out if anything! So so disappointed!",
