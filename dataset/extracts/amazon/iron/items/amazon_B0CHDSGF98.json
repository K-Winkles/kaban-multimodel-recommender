                "reviewText": "You won't regret this purchase! This is the best . You can do anything you want in this vessel. I was surprised by the quality. I'm a fan of cast iron and I own antique hand-me downs, new Lodge, and some new low-end enameled. The two latter have been the workhorses in my kitchen, but I needed a smaller vessell for everyday cooking so I decided to try this. So glad I discovered this beauty- I knew it would perform well because it's cast iron, but wasn't sure if the enamel would be quality. Well it IS. It cooks and cleans up like a dream. The lid fits perfectly and the knob is comfortable and seems to stay cool enough. This is a lovely vessel that a novice or a pro would love. Thanks for making a QUALITY product that is affordable! I LOVE MY NEW PAN!! This would make a great gift- it was perfectly packaged and arrived in pristine condition. GET IT- you'll love it too!",

She either destroys it, or carries it all over the house spilling food everywhere. What's worse is when it's a metal bowl and she throws it down the stairs onto the tile floor spilling food down the stairs, and shattering my nerves from the metal bouncing on the tile.Anyway, back to this amazing Dutch oven. I decided to get this because I figured it was heavy enough that she couldn't pick it up and throw it down the stairs. I needed it to be enameled so it wouldn't rust.This little baby has been life saver. I don't step on food anymore. My nerves are intact. It's pretty and looks great in the kitchen. She loves it and it's wide enough that her whiskers don't touch the sides when she eats.Definitely buying another one for me.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a stove to oven cast iron pot for my small toaster oven, but they are difficult to find, either because they are a skosh too wide or a skosh too tall.This one ALMOST fit, but the \"almost\" is what convinced me to replace my old TO, that no longer toasted as well as it once did.I kept the pot, and ordered the slightly-wider and taller TO. After appropriate seasoning and burn it, I used both for a trial run \"short cut\" chicken pot pie, to see how useful this will be for two person meals.I knew the cooking would go fast once the pie was assembled and in the oven so I diced and parboiled 3 small Yukon (chosen for their buttery creaminess) potatoes. While they cooked, i prepped and sauteed some onion, celery and carrots.When the aromatics were softened, I scraped them into a bowl and added a drained large can of chicken, drained potatoes, and frozen peas.Use the same pot, I made approximately 1.5-2 cups, of the white sauce (beurre blanc), seasoned with what came to hand, and cooked until it was as thick as I wanted. I mixed this with the ingredients in the bowl, wiped out the dutch oven, then poured the mixture back into it.I put the pot into the oven and heated it to 400 F. \"biscuit baking\" temperature, while separated small canned biscuits into two layers. FYI It took the took 10 halves or 5 biscuits to cover the surface and there were approximated 4 healthy servings in the filled pot.I was out of a few essential things that I had envisioned as contributors to the taste i was aiming for, like sage and fresh milk, so I substituted with what i had on hand. The test audience (Italian American) says that though this is a different flavor profile for him, it may be good enough to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We'll see how the flavor holds up overnight.But I am very happy with the size and functionality of this pot. Next up Coq Au Vin! Ham and scalloped potatoes! Pasta bakes...and, maybe, eventually, this recipe again, with fresh ingredients next time.My wooden lid fits tightly by the way, if I center it on the pot with the handles to the left and right and the name straight and level. But would i use it in the oven? Only for low and slow cooking.",

It is the next day and nothing. I was not asking for a refund or replacement. I was asking for manufacturer and seller's information. This is dangerous to have a dutch oven inside enamel blow up in your kitchen!! Update: last night i was browning ground beef for chili and the inside bottom blew up!!I love the color the size is perfect. I make homemade dog and it work well for that. However, the problem is it is chipped in 2 places. I'm extremely careful with it. I don't understand why it's chipping. It goes from the stove to the sink. I cleaned it out right away. It doesn't sit anywhere. It doesn't get put on a dishwasher or dish rack.I really love it, but it is not holding well if it can chip twice in a little over a month.",
