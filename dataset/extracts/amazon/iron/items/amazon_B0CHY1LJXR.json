The truth is, I don\u2019t actually know exactly how much iron I get from food or other sources, and I should probably start with knowing that, but I honestly can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s TOO much. These are small, easy to swallow, and taste like metal. I like all of those things. Highly recommend.",

The bottle contains a generous amount of 60 servings. In addition, these have some great supportive ingredients in good dosages. We find the bisglycinate form of iron to be gentle and easily absorbed. Although we haven't had lab work to confirm this, I am confident our iron levels have improved from our increased energy and general feeling of well-being. The capsules are easy to swallow with no bad taste or odor and cause no stomach discomfort. We take one per day with meals as suggested. These are a great price for the quality, ingredients, and amount.",

                "reviewText": "This iron supplement works pretty well. It comes with 60 capsules, which is 2 month worth of supply if you take one per day. They also added other ingredients to prevent digestion system discomfort, which is a welcome feature for me. The size of the capsule is normal, so it's effortless to swallow and it's preferred to take after a meal.",

                "reviewText": "These capsules contain 36mg of iron which is 200% of the recommended daily value (DV). They also contain 30mg vitamin C (33% DV), 5mg B6 (294% DV), 667mcg Folate (167% DV) and 30mcg B12 (1250% DV). I am taking it to increase the oxygen in my blood in an attempt to reduce hair loss caused by prescription medication. I\u2019ve noticed less hair falling out since I began taking it. So far I am quite pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a great supplement if you are just looking for a bioavailable iron that has other vitamins with it to help you absorb it. The amount of iron is ideal. As someone who has always struggled with iron deficiency, I realize it takes more than just your typical 18 mg of iron to increase your hemoglobin levels. I really appreciate the higher level on these. The bottle is small too, which is handy when one has a lot of other vitamin bottles in their cabinet. It is a good buy!",
