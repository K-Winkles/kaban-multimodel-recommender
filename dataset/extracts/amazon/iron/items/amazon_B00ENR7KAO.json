I have been taking it for 3 days now and today, I didn't feel like I needed to take a nap. Looking forward to seeing how it helps going forward and what my labs reveals in a few weeks.Edit: take with food! I didn't on day 1, and was nauseous and felt terrible. Now I take with an uncrustable and juice with vitamin c.",

I had been taking Ceregumil for several months and saw great results (it's no longer available on Amazon). LLorens is definitely stronger. I can't take it every day due to constipation (even while increasing fiber and taking a lower dosage). I take it a couple times a week. Not sure yet what effect it will have on my iron levels because they annual physical is a couple of months out.",
