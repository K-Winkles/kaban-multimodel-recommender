Therefore, old eyes like mine have a hard time seeing the water level while filling and ironing. #2 The thermostat moves to easily and is too close to the hand grip. Your hand sometimes will hit the thermostat when you are using the iron and change your setting. I do like the steam system and the weight of the iron. The weight is just right so you don't have to press down hard to get a smooth result. The steam system is far and above better than any iron I have ever owned.",

If you do not have a 20 amp breaker on your iron circuit, buy an iron with a lower power rating. A 1200 watt iron only uses 10 amps.
