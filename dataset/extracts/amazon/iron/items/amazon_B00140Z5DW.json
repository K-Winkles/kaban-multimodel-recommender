        "description": "Vitron-C is a high potency iron supplement formulated with Vitamin C to help your body better absorb iron. The use of an iron pill daily may boost energy by helping to fight fatigue in users with low iron levels* or iron-deficiency anemia. Vitron-C iron supplements contain carbonyl iron which provides gradual and gentle iron absorption and helps minimize constipation*. The added Vitamin C improves iron absorption*. Vitron-C iron with Vitamin C supplement is dye free, gluten free and vegan. Without enough iron, your body can't make enough hemoglobin, a substance that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Hemoglobin also helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron deficiency can affect many body functions. It can delay growth in children, stand in the way of our ability to do work as adults, cause problems during pregnancy and it can even cause heart problems, such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat. If your doctor advises that you have iron deficiency, talk to them about Vitron-C iron supplements. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Iron deficiency can cause anemia, delay a child\u2019s growth, damage a person's ability to think, and weaken their resistance to infection. What are the signs and symptoms of iron deficiency? Iron deficiency symptoms may include: being very tired, feeling weak, pale skin, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness or lightheadedness, and unusual cravings for non-nutritive substances, such as ice, dirt, or pure starch. Why is vitamin C often recommended along with an iron supplement? Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. So, whether you are eating iron-rich foods or taking an iron supplement, vitamin C taken at the same time can help with iron absorption. Why did the color of the tablet change from red to grey? The color change is the result of removing dyes from the product. The natural color of iron mixed with vitamin C and inactive ingredients results in a grey tablet. The levels of iron and vitamin C remain the same.",

                "reviewText": "According to my iron-research: one of the iron forms is \"carbonyl \", it's perhaps the purest form. it's the most ABSORBABLE type, and it's easy on the stomach, leading to fewer complaints. so, this type of iron supplements is way much better than my Rx from my Dr! On my 2nd pill of taking, I noticed there were NO side-effects, i.e., constipation vs Ferrous Sulfate EC 325 mg prescription--on my 3rd pill I was already experiencing the worst side-effect, constipation! Although I followed the directions: eat with food (wait an hour or two, then take the iron) I even took it with 2-capsules of Vit C/183 mg each capsules for absorption but I still got constipation from it, anyway. This Rx is covered by my health insurance, btw.Anyway, as I explored in Amazon, researching for better Iron supplements. I've learned that some come with Vit B12 (FYI: methylcobalamin is better than the cyanocobalamin aka \"cyanide\" synthetic additives!) plus Vit C. So, I already have these Vitamins, and all I've been doing is taking these vitamins with this vegan iron and it works out for me! I hope it will work out for you guys also.NOTE: I called the local pharmacy, and asked how to take the OTC-Vitron-C iron supplements with only 65 mg each tablet. Pharmacist responded, take only one a day, exactly like the Rx I was previously prescribed! I asked again if I need to triple the dosage to match the OTC 325 mg Rx? Pharmacist responded, no because it has ferrous iron with 325 mg also. I asked why OTC iron is not labeled with the correct mg? It's how they do it, as the pharmacist responded!Hopefully, this 90-day anemia treatment will improved the RED blood cells!",
