My mother thought I was nuts to spend this much on a steam iron, but this one really does what it is supposed to do and does it well. Now that I have it, I am really glad.My previous iron would turn off after a few minutes, leaving me constantly frustrated waiting for it to reheat after a quick trip to the sewing machine. This iron will stay hot. I do not know exactly how long, but after about one half hour or so it does beep to remind you that is still on. If you leave it turned on and facedown, it will beep after a few minutes.This iron really brings the heat, and it brings the steam as well, making short work out of yards of wrinkled cotton duck canvas, yet it has a delicate touch when turned to the \"synthetic\" or \"silk\" settings. This is a relatively heavy iron, so it does the work for you, not leaving you to push it into the fabric trying to get the effect you want.There are several accessories that you'll want to have in addition to the iron. One is a delicate teapot or a small funnel for getting water into the steam tank opening. The steam tank holds a good bit of water, but it will overflow if you put too much in. No harm done; you just have some water to mop up. The tank holds about 300 mL, or a little over a cup. Be ready to refill often if you are using the steam setting.Another item you will want to have is an iron cleaning kit. This is an awesome iron, and it does not get sticky easily, but it is a fact of life that all irons will encounter gunk eventually, particularly if you are working with starch. I use a kit made by Rowenta, and it has held out for years. It has a tube of cleaning compound, a rag for applying it to the iron's sole, and a last rag for polishing the sole of the iron when you are done cleaning. When you get the kit, read the directions for more specific details.The last tool I find handy is a hair mister. You will find one listed as a beauty product. It sprays a very fine mist on the fabric you are working on and you can control the density of the mist by the distance that you hold the tool. There is a sprayer mounted on the iron, but the spray it puts out is anemic and difficult to place where you need the water. So do yourself a favor and pick up a hairspray out from the beauty department. I have two of them!Please watch your left hand if you are right-handed. I was holding some fabric down with my left hand while I was ironing, and by accident I tipped the iron in the direction of my left hand. The burn I inflicted on my left index finger was something to behold. The day after the burn, it blistered to the point where the blister popped. At that point I kept it under a Band-Aid for a number of days until the burn healed enough to do without a Band-Aid. I almost nailed my thumb a little while later, but I put ice on it right away and I must not have gotten that much steam on it because it only hurt a little bit for a few days. Forgive me if this is too much information, but you really need to know. If you are left-handed, keep an eye on your right hand. While I am on the topic of hands, I might as well mention that this iron is ambidextrous. You may use it equally with either hand.If you are serious about your sewing, get this iron. If you are just starting out and you have the money, get this iron. If you have kids around, maybe get a different iron, one that turns off right away when you leave it. This includes most irons. If you are just starting out and you do not get this iron, eventually you might want to upgrade. I'm just saying.",

                "reviewText": "This is a first time purchase of this iron, and I've been using it for over 2 months. I am very pleased in several ways. It is lightweight, but for me, the perfect size and the pointed end is just right. The dials are easy to use and the iron very easily goes from no steam to as much as you need, and the best news is...NO LEAKING or SPITTING. This is a big feature for me. It heats up very quickly and stays on for more than 30 min. It makes an audible sound when it's heated and also when it times out. At that point the red light starts to blink. I previously owned a Reliable and it was fantastic till it wore out. But it's pricey so I decided to try a different brand. I am well pleased. I do a lot of sewing, quilting, and therefore, ironing. I hope my review is convincing.",

It glides super smoothly and the steam function works amazingly well! It steams when set flat, and stops when the iron is set on its heel. I'm amazed by this since the cheaper irons I've used don't seem to do this properly.It's decently quiet when the steaming stops, but like other irons there is a (in this case small) burst of noise when the iron is set down.The I do also appreciate the aesthetics of this iron. I'd recommend it.",

After spending several hundred dollars on a professional Oliso iron, which broke when it fell on the floor and can't be fixed, I got this one because a friend said she loves her Chi iron. Now I love mine too. I got the less expensive one with the temperature dial. It has great steam when needed. Easy to fill with tap water--no need for distilled water. Love the point in the front for clothes construction and quilt piecing. Love that it has the auto-off but not until 30 minutes. A Rowenta I had once sounded like a truck backing up to warn me of the auto off going off and scared the bejeebeezs out of me. This Chi just quietly does it thing. Love it and would highly recommend.",
