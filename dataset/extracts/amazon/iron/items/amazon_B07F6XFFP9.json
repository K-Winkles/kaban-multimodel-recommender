                "reviewText": "I absolutely have to have a cordless iron. I am disabled, and have difficulty managing a corded iron, because I run them over, which tends to melt the cord. Or the cord gets in my way, and I make a total mess of what I\u2019m ironing. I\u2019ve had an old Orick, that I got many years ago, and it just was too heavy, and was no longer doing its job very well, was leaking. It was also very heavy on its base, and my old wobbly board was not standing up to it.This is the perfect solution! Instead of a great big, charging base to place it in, creating a very heavy thing sitting on the ironing board while you\u2019re ironing, this has a nice small pad, that is lightweight in and of itself. The iron is super lightweight, and it\u2019s very easy to place it back into its charging pad when necessary. Even though it\u2019s lightweight, the iron does its job amazingly well! I have had heavy curtains that I\u2019ve had to iron the creases into, in order to create a new hem. My old iron had a heckuva time with it. This thing did an amazing job, even though it hadn\u2019t had as much weight behind it to press with. Clearly the weight of the iron is not the only thing that works.Initially, I had trouble with the steam, I think that it was because it wasn\u2019t fully primed. I\u2019ve used it since then, and not had any trouble with the steam.Many people may complain about the fact that it does not hold the heat for long. This is, unfortunately, a common issue with a cordless of anything. The heavier iron probably held its heat slightly longer, but I am willing to trade that off for the ease of use of this one. The charging pad has a green light during the amount of time that should be good for heat, and blinks red when it\u2019s time to put it back. I haven\u2019t timed it myself, but I didn\u2019t find it to need to be recharged any sooner than I would\u2019ve already laid the iron down to shift my fabrics. Clearly, that amount of time is appropriate , at least for me.I absolutely adore this iron! This iron makes my life incredibly easier! I should buy 10 of them just to make sure that there I will have one, if this one ever breaks, lol. If Black & Decker stopped making this model, I will be crying.",

                "reviewText": "I am a seamstress and handmade artisan living in a very small apartment and had been using a very small corded travel iron and an over-the-door ironing board in my bedroom. After the last time bumping the board the iron came crashing down again, barely missing my feet. It stopped working and I knew enough was enough! It was time to invest in a full sized cordless. I rearranged a few items on a small stand a few away from the board to keep the iron out and plugged in when needed without have to store it or keep it on the board when in use. I tested it out with a wrinkled cotton maxi dress for first usage, and I am so happy with it! I agree with the comments that due to the nature of the technology and the battery pack, this iron does not stay warm for very long before it beeps to reheat. However, I keep the stand on the little shelf a few feet away, working quickly, and put it back on the base when I need to readjust. I ironed many items to see how I'd like it and if I would get annoyed with the short time before recharging, including button down shirts and cotton shorts, and I am so happy! Most times it's \"green\" or shortly after when I am ready. It is MUCH hotter and of course larger surface than my tiny travel iron, so for me it makes ironing faster and easier and I don't worry about hurting myself or safety due to the shut-off feature if I walk away. I LOVE it and find the lack of cord, level of steam/heat and ease of use of the round charging base far outweighing the inconvenience of how quickly it needs to be recharged. I even worked on sewing a cotton blouse and am still happy with using it for sewing projects. But I can totally see how others would get completely frustrated and hate using it. Decide for yourself if your patience level and usage needs will work with this iron. For me, HUGE WIN. And, bonus.. it's purple and looks great sitting out.",

(This is not my go to iron when I have actual ironing to do or need to press large pieces of fabric.) Love that I don't have a cord in my way. I also like that the charging station is a small base and not a big stand. I have a small little pressing table set up next to my sewing machine, it's nice to be able to have the charging base right there and not take up a lot of space. Only con for me is that is does take a little longer to heat up than I'd like but it's not bad.",
