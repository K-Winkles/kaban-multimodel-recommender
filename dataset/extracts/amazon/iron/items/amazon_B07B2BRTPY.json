                "reviewText": "I use this iron in my sewing room to press seams, interfacing, etc. It does get hot enough to do this, and does a fine job. It is small and light enough to get into small spaces. It is also small enough that I can use it in my embroidery hoop to press tacked down applique pieces. The cord free feature is wonderful. The auto off is not a big deal, as it heats very quickly. It is a perfect light duty iron, easily pressing low wrinkle pieces for a crisp finish, with good steam. I especially like this iron as it does not heat up my sewing room, a plus in Arizona in the summer. I have not found it useful for very wrinkled fabric or clothing - for this I use my Rowenta, which gets very hot and generates tremendous heat.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far the most expensive iron I have ever bought but it is absolutely worth the price! I will never go back to a corded iron again. This baby is a delight to use! It's lightweight but presses beautifully. The ceramic sole slides like a dream. I love the detachable water reservoir -- no more spilling water all over the ironing board trying to fill the iron! It did take me a little while to get into the habit of putting it back in its cradle every time I wanted to set it down -- you can't just stand it on its end like a regular iron. But that's a small price to pay for going cordless. Also, with it pointy on both ends I find that I don't accidentally iron in wrinkles as often as I used to. It heats up pretty quickly, and the heat lasts plenty long for my purposes -- you can only iron as much as fits on the ironing board, and then you have to set the iron down and rearrange the cloth or whatever. When you're ready to iron again it's all heated up and ready to go.",
