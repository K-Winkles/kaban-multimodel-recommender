It is light weight and very well made; has a compartment for the iron and cord, and a pocket for an iron rest and the iron\u2019s manual. Some reviewers complained that the case did not have a handle; however, it has a D-ring and came with a carabiner. I can live with that! I highly recommend this mini iron case.",
