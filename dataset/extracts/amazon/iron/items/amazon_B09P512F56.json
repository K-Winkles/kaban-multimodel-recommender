Lol, don\u2019t get the wrong idea about me, I don\u2019t actually iron a whole lot. But when I received baby clothes for online orders and they are shrink wrapped with a bazillion wrinkles, this was the perfect tool!",

HOWEVER, for some reason, about every third time turning it on, it doesn't heat up, the blue/white lights flash alternatively and I have to unplug it and plug it back in, then it works as it should.Other than that, it works great for my needs and is small enough to not be intrusive on my small portable ironing table.",
