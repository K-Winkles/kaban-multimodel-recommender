I tried liquid iron(ew) and a couple OTC iron pills. All of the other pills made my pregnancy constipation even worse and I was miserable. I gave these a try and not only have I NOT been constipated, but I've felt some of my energy return. They are easy on my stomach, you don't notice any bad flavors, and they are easy to take. Highly reccomend these (with doctor approval)!",

My hemoglobin levels came back under 12 and the suggested dose is 4 capsules, however I started with 2 this morning and I am glad I took it slow, because they made me feel very activated and hyper, almost uncomfortably so, but I will give it time to settle in my system. I know some times getting a deficiency back up can be uncomfortableHowever, about half of the capsules are way under filled, only about 3/4 of the way..at first I thought maybe that was how they're supposed to be but they all range in how full they are.. some are all the way full, some 3/4, some only a little under filled. The inconsistency is a little worrisome",
