                "reviewText": "I really like this iron. It heats up fast and works great, even on very wrinkled 100% cotton materials. The steam function works great, and I love the burst of steam and spray options. It's easy to use & has a nice balance to it. I just have a few minor complaints which are not a deal breaker. 1) The instructions do not tell me how to use the Self Clean function. 2) Instructions do not tell me the 3 positions in which the iron will automatically turn off. 3) I am unable to pull out the end for the cord storage. My model is not the retractable cord model, but it IS the model that has the cord storage, and I can't get it open, and neither can my husband. 4) The water tank cover won't close unless you push really, really hard.12-15-22 Update: I contacted the manufacturer and they were able to provide me with instructions for issues 1 & 2 above. For #3, you just have to grab and wiggle the cord storage section, while pulling really hard. Then it will come open. For #4, you just have to push really hard to get the cover to close. See below for instructions regarding #1 and 2 ....... ( I am also changing the rating to 4 stars)IHere are instructions in email from the manufacturer that are not included in the instruction pamphlet in the box:Below are instructions for cleaning your sole plate and use of the self-clean feature.To clean the sole plate, use the steam function on an old cotton towel. Fill the unit with water, allow the unit to heat on the cotton setting for 2 minutes the use the steam feature while ironing on the cotton towel. This will help remove any build up that may be on the sole plate.If you have not done so, we recommend cleaning the inside of your iron as well.We have provided the self-clean steps below:1.Turn Temperature Control Dial to OFF (O) and set Adjustable Steam Switch to Dry Iron. Fill iron with water to 1/2 of its maximum capacity.2. Turn Temperature Control Dial to Linen setting and let iron heat for 2 minutes. Keep Adjustable Steam Switch on Dry Iron.3. Turn Temperature Control Dial to OFF (O). Unplug iron and hold over a sink with sole plate facing down.4. Turn Adjustable Steam Switch to MAX, while pressing Self-Clean/Blast Button often. Boiling water and steam will flow out of steam vents. Allow all water to drain from iron.5. Gently move iron front to back to allow water to clean entire sole plate area.6. If water still remains inside of sole plate, reheat iron as indicated in Step 2. Boiling water and steam could still flow out of steam vents.Remember to empty all the water after each use. If the water is not emptied, it may interact with the metal of the iron and cause the water to discolor. This will result in steam and water droplets discoloring clothing.Also, this model is equipped with the 3-way auto shutoff. Here are the ways the appliance will auto shutoff:a) Shut off mode should occur within 30 +/-5 seconds if the iron is left motionless while resting on the soleplate.b) Shut off mode should occur within 15+/- minutes if the iron is left motionless while resting on its heel.c) While resting on its side, shut off mode may occur either within 30 +/-5 seconds, or within 15 +/-2 minutes if the iron is left motionless.",

                "reviewText": "This was the iron I was looking for when I tried a number of others. The primary thing I like is the ability to turn the Steam on and off while you are ironing. Some similar irons from other makers require you to either have the tank empty or filled with water to either have Steam or, but with this model you can iron on the go either dry or with steam. That is important to me because I use starch for my shirts and can easily switch back and forth to get the finish that I like. Easy to use and does a a nice job.",
