                "reviewText": "I bought this Chi Iron for my sewing room. I wanted a Rowenta level iron, but have been concerned with the negative reviews on their irons recently. My setup uses a silicone iron rest and a large wool pressing mat on the end of my large work table. When it first arrived I set it up and was impressed with hot fast it heated. This iron is more wattage than I\u2019ve owned previously. I get a small amount of dimming on lights that are plugged into my outlets, but I expected that. I sew with mostly woven fabrics of varying weights, linen and cotton. I filled the water tank. Steamed up a wrinkled linen. Not \u201cinsanely crisp\u201d after one pass but not wrinkled. But it was leaking from the handle right below the water tank lid. I emptied the while thing out, refilled carefully. Aaaand leaking again. I messaged Amazon and they had a replacement at my house the next day. I was able to choose my local Whole Foods for the returned package and dropping it there was easy peasy. The counter was at the front of the store, they scanned the barcode in my Amazon App and showed me the confirmation on their end. Three seconds. And I needed bread so that was perfect. The second iron worked just as great with no leaking at all. I\u2019ve been using it a month now and I am still in love with it. Best features: Heats fast fast fast, from cold to whatever temp you pick. Water tank holds a lot of water and is easy to see where the water level is located. Steam is fantastic. Buttons are easy to push and the cap for the water flips up easily. (My last iron had a water cap that was more like a secret door because it was so hard to open without a nail file or something tiny) Oh and it\u2019s easy to see what setting and if the iron is on from far away because of the light at the base of the handle and the large letters on the settings that light up. Oh, AND the cord is so long I can plug it in 5 feet away and still have room to navigate.Cons: Small hole for water. See photos, I use my tiny watering can and it\u2019s perfect!! The nose of the iron isn\u2019t quite as thin as I wanted, but it is still okay.See photos for visuals. \ud83d\udc95",

                "reviewText": "After having used Rowenta irons for almost 20 years, their drop in quality even in \"German made\" models made me reconsider purchasing that brand, so I ended up with a Chi. Compared to my previous iron this model is a little smaller and much lighter, but it performs well so I am not missing the size of my other iron. It heats up faster than the Rowenta and plays a beep both when turning on, and also beeps when reaching the target temperature. The titanium dioxide coated plate slides smoothly over clothes and the plate doesn't snag on shirt buttons, unlike my previous iron. So far no water leaks, although I did notice this iron doesn't produce as much steam as the Rowenta with the electronic pump did so you have to go easy on it.Cord is longer and doesn't snag, but I noticed there is a tendency for the strain relief part to get caught up on the ironing board which sometimes makes the iron unstead when placed on end quickly. This isn't a deal breaker but it may get annoying.More annoying is that Chi decided to place the single temperature change button right on the top surface of the handle below the steam button, which is the logical place to put your hand when applying pressure to cuffs or collars. Applying enough pressure to the button will of course cause the temperature to change, so you then have to stop ironing, and press the button five or six times to slowly cycle back to your desired temperature. At least the iron beeps to warn you that you pressed the button, but why not put it literally anywhere else on the iron? Despite this design issue causing grief three or four times already, I'm still pretty happy with the iron which costs less than half of what a Rowenta cost me.",

I use it for table linens, button front shirts, other clothes. I think it would be good for sewing projects as it stays \u201con\u201d for 30 minutes between uses. My previous iron was made by a famous European brand known for their irons and this Chi iron by far exceeds the performance my old one. Glad I spent a little more to get this one - laundry day is easier!",
