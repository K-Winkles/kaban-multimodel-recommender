And its not just a few drops, but also not like a downpour either. So be cautious, but other than that, is a great product!",

                "reviewText": "It's a rather nice travel iron, or just a smaller sized iron if you're looking for something more compact that doesn't take up a lot of space. The fact that it doubles as a steamer is convenient as those can get pretty big. However you are obviously not going to get the same performance out of it as you would a full-size steamer.Still it's handheld and relatively light. It has a nice design, and is comfortable to hold, which is important since you will also just be holding it up to steam potentially, and that could get tiring if it was too heavy. But it's a good weight, not too hard on your arms.It actually rather un-ambiguously works well as a normal iron. It's a smaller size, but it heats up quickly, and does the job.As a steamer, my experience was a little bit more mixed. It's water tank is obviously limited in size, that's unavoidable. But it does emit a decent amount of steam. The control scheme is a little odd and takes a bit getting used to. The pictures I included are of a shirt I steamed, and as you can see it didn't do a horrible job, but it didn't quite get it all the way either. The cord is also rather short, which is annoying for a handheld device you're going to be waving around while it's plugged in. It's great for touch-ups, but if you want to steam an entire piece of clothing, it's a little bit more challenging, and you won't get perfect results.Still I like this device, It does a decent job both as an iron and as a steamer especially considering it's small size. The unit also seems pretty robust, and it should last a long time.",

                "reviewText": "\ud83d\udc4d Pros:Compact and Travel-Friendly: The Mini Steam Iron has quickly become my go-to travel companion. Its compact size is perfect for packing in my suitcase or even a carry-on bag. Whether I'm on a business trip or heading to a college dorm, this iron easily fits into my travel plans.2-in-1 Versatility: One feature that I truly appreciate is its 2-in-1 functionality. It not only serves as a traditional dry iron but also offers the convenience of a steamer for quick touch-ups. This versatility means I can handle various clothing materials, from dress shirts to delicate fabrics, without any hassle.Fast Heat-Up: Time is of the essence, especially when I'm in a hurry. This mini steam iron heats up remarkably fast, so I can quickly de-wrinkle my clothes and be out the door in no time. It's a real time-saver for busy mornings or last-minute outfit adjustments.\ud83d\udc4e Cons:Water Tank Size: While the compact size is a plus for portability, it does come with a smaller water tank. This means that it might require refilling more frequently, especially when using the steaming function. It's a minor inconvenience, but it's something to be aware of, particularly for longer ironing sessions.In conclusion, the Mini Steam Iron is a reliable companion for wrinkle-free clothing, whether at home, during travel, or at college. Its compact size and 2-in-1 functionality make it a valuable addition to my routine, even though the smaller water tank might require occasional refills. \u2708\ufe0f\ud83d\udc5a\ud83c\udfe2\ud83e\uddf3",
