                "reviewText": "This iron is not intended for travel use or home use. It shouldn\u2019t be purchased at all. My daughter and I purchased a total of five in November 2021. We thought it would make a great quilting piecing iron. It has a great point and that\u2019s the only positive quality about it. The first one had a fire inside smoked and quit working immediately within two weeks. The second one I use for a little longer and the handle broke and so did my daughters at the same time within one week we both had a handle break off. I included pictures of how to handle breaks with plastic circles that hold on the back part of the handle (plastic circles!!). I\u2019ve never had a iron to break that quickly and believe me I have bought a number of irons to use for quilting. I am angry because we bought five irons and we have one left in six months. If you want to waste your money Then continue buying this iron. If you don\u2019t want to waste your money or time then don\u2019t buy desired and you won\u2019t waste your time! The representative at the manufacturer told me this iron was for very light use and not for any other use. The manual says for household use. If you buy one at Amazon and it has a problem within 30 days then it will be replaced by Amazon. The warranty is no good with manufacturer and all of these breakages are considered normal wear and tear! You will not get your money back or help or partial refund or anything else except for maybe their advice on what other iron that they make that you should buy! I will never buy another iron from Brentwood.!!!",
