Heads up very quickly and has a mini stand to rest it on while you flip your clothing item or whatever. I think it's a great idea, but it doesn't help too much when I still have to put up an ironing board to use it. Today I acted as if I was on a trip and used it on the bathroom counter. Issue with that was with the steam it let out, the surface got wet a little which got the clothing item damp. Not crazy damp, but damp. So as a replacement for an iron, not sure I can say I'd use it for that simply because of the shape too. Missing the point that an iron has allows you to reach those hard to reach parts, whereas a rounded nose makes it more difficult. It's pretty compact and comes with a small cloth carrying/ storage bag. Overall a nice item to have around. An improvement to the item would be if it could be used in a vertical position as well.",

                "reviewText": "The main reason I bought this was for steaming my clothes when they're hanging, and you can't use this like that - well, you can, but it's not effective. So far, none of my cotton garments have gotten dewrinkled; I haven't tried my more delicate fabrics (rayon) but it should work well just because rayon smooths out as easily as it creases. I needed to steam a couple of tea towels to frame, but I'll have to use a traditional iron method, which I was trying to avoid since the printing on these towels is very much decorative and I'm not sure how it's going to hold up. This would absolutely work as a steam iron, but then you're filling up the reservoir often if you're ironing more than maybe 2 things.Thankfully the water hasn't leaked, even with all the moving around.The unit warms up very fast - and STAYS hot long after you unplug it - I burned myself twice the first time I used it.*No on/off button, you just have to unplug it. I really hate that.Certainly not for travel, hotel (and even motel rooms sometimes) provide little irons that will do the same thing, unless you're going somewhere bear-bones but also still somehow need a steamer.All in all, I would have returned this if I could since it's not what it claims to be nor what I needed/wanted, but I purchased it through Vine for a discount so I'm unable to.",

The tank lid pops whenever it's unplugged and cooling regardless of the water level.3. The cup had a crack in the bottom.NOW FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF:1. THE ONLY WAY TO TURN IT ON AND OFF IS BY PLUGGING AND UNPLUGGING.2. I read all the important safeguards which say \"(Note: Do not turn ON the power before adding water)\", but later in the instructions, it says to \"add water promptly\" if the water runs low, which means it WILL BE ON.3. Swiveling the handle does not turn it on or off, and the handle must be in swiveled out to fill the water reservoir.4. Instructions say to have the unit in the OFF position, but later says to unplug it to turn it off. Again, there IS NO ON/OFF SWITCH.5. Under IRONING METHOD, #4 says \"Double click on the switch to STOP WORKING.\" It does NOT STOP WORKING. It sets it back to 1 - DRY mode.",
