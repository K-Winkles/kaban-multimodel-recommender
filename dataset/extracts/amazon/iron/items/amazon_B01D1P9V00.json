For quilting it's been great so far especially for the price. It gets my seams crisp and my fabric wrinkle free. I mainly got it because my favorite color is green and I needed a steam iron. I do really like the retractable cord! I hate having dangling cords everywhere so it's a great feature. I'll warn you that it does retract really fast so don't be silly like me and let it go so fast it flys up and hits you in the face. Ouch!

                "reviewText": "This is a decent iron - it does the job adequately. It's really good at letting off steam, but the tank is a little awkward to fill. There are a lot of temperature options, and you can turn the dial all the way to the right to shut it off. I would say it's a medium weight. I prefer heavier irons because they get out wrinkles better in my opinion. The water spray button was tough at first. When I got the iron, I thought it was broken. But after using both thumbs and pushing HARD several times, it finally started working. Now I can push it with one thumb and normal pressure to get a spray. The cord retraction also isn't the best, but it's not a big deal to me. Finally, note that the inside of the iron is supposed to have condensation when you get it - this means it was tested by the manufacturer before it was shipped. Overall it's not the best iron I've ever used, but it will get out your wrinkles without too much effort.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great iron. The water tank is large (can take water directly from the tap), it heats up quickly, turns off when \"idle\" for a few minutes. It's fairly heavy, which is what I wanted-- there is a lightweight version that I haven't tried-- and the dial moves easily and it well placed at the top of the handle. It's not expensive. I had a Black and Decker that suddenly gave out, it's one that is no longer made, and so I tried this one. This is so much better. The water tank is larger, the dial moves much more easily than the previous one, which was quite stiff, and the placement at the top of the handle, instead of awkwardly inside the bottom, the way the other one was. It also gets hotter than the other one-- the previous one I generally used at 6 on cotton, but on this newer model, 5 is plenty and 6 is on the verge of scorching the fabric. Can't recommend it highly enough.",

                "reviewText": "i have always liked the black & decker brand, and was so excited when i used this iron for the first time. it was easy to fill, lightweight, & had the right temperatures for the garments i was pressing. i didn't like that the higher temperatures could only be selected with steam, but that was not a huge issue. my satisfaction continued until it stopped heating up 2 weeks after the return window closed. i do not iron every day, & sometimes go a whole week without having to iron anything. maybe if i did iron every day, i would have found out before the return window closed & saved the $3 return charge for the plug. on the upside, though, i will get another iron that works for at least 2 yrs - the length of the warranty. i will update this review, if possible, in a few weeks, after i receive the replacement & have used it at least 20 times. tip: register this iron by calling black & decker 1.800.231.9786, instead of using the unsecure website on the box.update 25 january 2020: i have been using this iron for a while now. overall, it is a fair iron. so, i've upgraded my review from 2 stars to 3 stars.pros: fills easily; lightweight; correct temperature; heats to selected temperature in about a minute; reheats after auto shut-off in a little over 30 seconds. tip: you have to put the iron in the ironing position - soleplate down - to reheat it after auto shut-off.cons: water line is hard to see through the red tint; steam is dramatically reduced when water level is 5/8 or below - it is almost non-existent at that level, but, on the plus side, i use that as an indication that i need to add water, since it's hard to see the water level; intemittent leaking.",

                "reviewText": "My Iron was still running after 20 years, but the electric cord within the unit was loose, making it dangerous. So I was surprised to see all the Irons and prices. This Black & Decker had good reviews, and I must say Irons have advanced. I do not have to use the Steam feature for most of my clothing to get a good press. The sharp point allows me to get into tight places easily. It is also lighter than my previous iron. I do appreciate the upright steam feature as well. The one minus which many mention is it is very difficult to read the amount of water in the tank. The hub of the cord on the bottom was stiff at the beginning making it difficult to lay the iron upright, but it has softened up. All-in-all a good little workhouse for one of our most monotonous but necessary home tasks.",
