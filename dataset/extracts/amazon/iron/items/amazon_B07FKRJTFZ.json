                "reviewText": "I got fed up with my big deluxe full sized Iron, it kept shutting down and cooling if I let it sit for a few minutes which was maddening because I sew handmade fabric items daily. I need to go back to iron while piecing, multiple times during product construction, finding it got cold. Maddening auto shut off! So, I decided to purchase a smaller easy to use iron, and this little black+decker is excellent. It stays warm and heats back up the second I move it and stays on till I unplug it. It also has a smaller tip, perfect for the creases and nooks of my designs. The price was affordable. The Iron is excellent for crafting, detail sewing. I\u2019d buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a super lightweight and compact iron with good gliding surface. It works well, no dripping so far, I find the cable to be long enough. It is compact, but the water tank is enough for about 10 minutes of ironing at full power without need for refill. Iron is only 1200 W, not 2000 W as stated here. I bought this IR06V variant for 40 CAD and preferred it over buying the cheaper one IR06VC sold for 25 CAD just because I thought it was 2000 W. I wonder what the difference between IR06V and IR06VC is. When used at maximum power the iron turns on every 15-20s when in use, which is a bit unusual. Anyways I use it for daily quick (max 5 minutes) ironing at full power and so far no issues with it. I might write an update later. And for those that might be concerned, I also had water droplets inside the tank, but this should be not something one should be worried about. It is actually a proof that this item was tested for quality.",
