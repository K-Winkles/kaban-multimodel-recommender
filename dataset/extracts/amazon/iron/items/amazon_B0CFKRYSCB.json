When I got it, I thought I could steam upright like other steamers, but this is not the case. This is more of an iron with a steamer feature. There are no buttons to adjust the temperature or the heat of the steamer iron, but it's never burnt my clothes, with or without the steamer feature turned on. The steamer doesn't take long too heat up.I have travelled with it, and it travels well. The steamer iron folds in a way that makes it easy to pack up in a suitcase or luggage. You may need to find a space to put the small pitcher cup, as putting water in the steamer without it can be quite a hassle. I do wish that the steamer came with a case to hold the two pieces that come with it. Also, make sure that you have a flat surface that you can put your clothes on to use the steamer. It can work upright, but it takes longer and is a lot harder to use. Most hotels have an ironing board which would get the job done.",

This one stands out for its compact size, which allows for swift setup and storage.The device doubles as a steamer and an iron, but using it as an iron comes with a small hitch \u2013 the steam doesn't auto-off when you pause, so you'll need to manually toggle it to avoid over-steaming your clothes.Where it really wins points is in its steaming function. The arm's swivel design grants better handling, a feature my other steamers lack. Plus, it doesn't sputter water, sparing my clothes from those dreaded wet patches.It's not just functional; my fiance loves its sleek design, finding it both modern and stylish. Its small size and ease of use make it perfect for travel \u2013 a trusty tool for on-the-go garment care.",

This steamer is amazing works instantly and it remove wrinkles like you would not believeOn my video, you can see it literally lifting wrinkles upon contact. It took me maybe two minutes to do the whole back of this particular blouse.Definitely fill the steamer full and keep track of how much water you have in there because you\u2019ll probably have to refill it if you have more than one blouse to doI\u2019m actually excited to start steaming my clothes because I have a product that is so fabulous this is super lightweight and easy to use it so small you\u2019ll definitely want to pack it when you travelIt also comes with a plate to set it on when it\u2019s done being used which is super handy because you don\u2019t want to set hot things anymoreThe only things that I didn\u2019t like was the length of the cord I love that it\u2019s a braided cord but it\u2019s a little short so you\u2019re definitely gonna wanna make sure that your clothes are close to a outlet when you\u2019re steaming",

                "reviewText": "I never imagined that a steamer so compact and easy to travel with, would work as great as this one does. I'm truly blown away. It's super easy to use - just add a little water to the reservoir, plug it in, give it a minute to heat up, and press the button to start the steam. It comes with a small tray to sit it in too, so you don't burn anything when it's not in use. The handle swivels outward so you don't burn yourself when using it and then swivels back for compact storage. It's definitely a great size for travel and doesn't take up very much room in luggage, but can also be used at home on an everyday basis. Plus, it does a really great job at getting wrinkles out of clothing.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this little travel iron and steamer for exactly the purpose of travel.Comes with directions/guide, cup, base, and steam iron.Everything was packaged really well and had no issues out of the box.Really like the look of this little iron with the trim in white. It is very elegant looking. The cord is long enough to do what you need to do, but not so long to be a headache when trying to pack it back up. I'm able to steam and iron my clothes just fine. I don't have a travel ironing board, so I either hang the clothes form the hanger to steam them or put them on a towel to do a quick touch up ironing. Works pretty well for that.There's no settings like in most house steam irons besides plugging this in, the iron heating up, and being able to turn the steam on and off. The handle rotates and locks at 0, 90, and 180 degrees.Overall, there's not much more to be said for this little travel friendly steam iron. It does exactly the job it needs to do and not much more. It just looks really nice doing it and then folds away easily.",

It's better for using with an ironing board that is stationary. Also if it's at a crazy angle, like it being completely vertical, it will have a problem pulling the water from the reservoir but I've noticed that with a lot of the steamer irons and as long as you keep it relatively flat it doesn't have that issue, so that is somewhat of a nonissue and is probably not intended to be used in the way I was trying to use it (i.e. to steam out wrinkles in curtains that are currently still hung instead of taking the curtain down).",
