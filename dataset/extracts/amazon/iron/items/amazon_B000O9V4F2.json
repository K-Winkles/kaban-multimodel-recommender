                "reviewText": "This iron was recommended to me by my sister...who's doctor recommended it to her for having very low iron (both of us were born with Anemia). She told me that after taking it for some time, her blood test results showed that she no longer had Anemia. She also said that she included more dark green leafy veggies in her diet as well.I was a bit skeptical (and not a big fan of most leafy greens). However, I wanted to give this iron a chance because throughout the years, I had always been told by my doctors that there was nothing I could do to improve my iron because I was born with Anemia.I have been using it for quite a while, about 2 yrs. I recently decided to have some blood work done to check a variety of things, including my iron levels. To my great surprise, my iron levels were NORMAL!! I couldn't believe it, I had to ask my doctor to recheck her notes! I have NEVER had normal iron levels (just to mention, I'm over 40 years old)!Since she is my new doctor, I explained to her that I had been taking this particular iron and was always told by doctors that it couldn't be corrected. She responded by saying that \"she doesn't believe in taking supplements\". I was quite surprised by her response and said, \"if you had told me that a few years ago, I would've agreed with you. But after seeing the proof, I definitely believe now!!!\"Let me say this, I definitely do NOT work for this company. I'm just so ecstatic that I was able to improve my health in some way even though medical doctors told me differently. Maybe any good iron supplement will do this. I can only speak for this one.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve taken this supplement for about 4 weeks now because I have autoimmune hemolytic anemia. My RBC count got so low I spent weeks in the hospital and received several units of blood before they got everything stabilized. The high doses of steroids they prescribed make me feel awful, so I had to find a way to make RBCs faster than my body destroys them.This has helped keep my counts within an acceptable level, although not totally good yet. No constipation, but I tried taking more than one capsule a day and it tore my system up causing horrible cramps. So, I backed off to 1 daily and I hope that I can stay away from the steroids. My heart rate and blood pressure have improved modestly too.I\u2019ll update in a couple of months.*update 10/02/2020 -- still taking one capsule a day, along with a standard multivitamin. Feeling better and stronger, have been able to stay away from the steroids for my AHA. I don't know what my current RBC numbers are, but I'm not short of breath, so I assume they aren't too bad. No discomfort at all with this formula, so I'm sticking with it.**update 5/9/2021 -- I'm doing really well on these capsules and keeping my hemoglobin around 10 without any steroids or other medications.***update 1/11/22 \u2014 still taking this supplement. I rode my bike 24 miles today, that pretty much says everything. I\u2019m eating keto-ish, feeling great, losing weight, and gaining strength. No problems with anemia. My doctors are amazed and impressed.",
