I just tried it today and I\u2019m amazed that it actually worked, and worked pretty quickly and easily. My iron had some light brown stains. Probably burned on starch. I followed the directions that came in the package, and the stains started immediately coming off. 95% of it came off really quickly. There were a couple of small spots that were a little stubborn. I kept working on it and they came off. I was left with one little area about the size of a pencil eraser that was still there. I ended up wrapping a small wooden skewer with the white Terry towel. I dabbed on a little bit of the cleaner and rubbed that part with the iron sitting up, being careful not to burn myself. Everything came off perfectly. It\u2019s like a new iron again.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived in a beat up box that looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for 20 years. But the product worked well. My iron soleplate was stained with heavy stubborn buildup from what I presumed was hard water calculus that appeared following a lengthy \"session\" with a damp press cloth. I wasn't convinced I hadn't ruined my iron. NOTHING else worked to get the buildup off. Gave this a try....worked beautifully. Used 2 applications of a 2 inch ribbon of the cream and all of the stains disappeared. Iron is back to ironing beautifully and glides well. I did it outdoors because I read reviews about smoking/fumes. I did not have this experience. Smoked a small amount (which is normal according to package), but nothing serious.Drawback: small amounts of the cream collected in the holes and did NOT come out using the steam burst function (per the instructions). Had to use a toothpick and small amounts remained. Ran iron over a clean cloth with heavy steam to ensure future fabric won't be affected",

                "reviewText": "The sole plate of my relatively new Rowenta iron was accumulating a dark film from all of the ironing I have been doing as I work on a quilt project that has several fabrics that have some materials that are not very iron-friendly. Despite only ironing on the wrong side, the dark material was accumulating and was incredibly resistant to coming off.I was tempted to go with a different brand of iron cleaner chemical that was half the price, but the reviews I read indicated that the Rowenta system - gunk remover paste, remover cloth, and polishing cloth - were well worth the money.In less than 10 minutes of work, ALL of the nasty gunk came off of my iron and it looks like new again! The paste and cleaning towel system was super easy to use, had no unpleasant odor, and did not make a mess at all. I seriously could not be more happy! I needed to do two applications to get all of the dark residue off the iron, but it had been accumulating for several months. I still have enough paste to clean the iron at least 10 more times and the towels are very generous in size to complete multiple cleanings as well.MONEY WELL SPENT! This product works as promised :)",

                "reviewText": "Rowenta Iron Soleplate cleaning kit worked perfectly on my Rowenta SteamForce iron. Iron had some stains and draggy buildup. This kit includes a cleaner tube, a white cloth and a green cloth. Process is very easy and It takes only few minutes to clean the iron. All you have to do is (1) empty any water inside the iron and put iron on \u201cCotton\u201d setting (2) put an old cloth on ironing board and put 2 folded white cloth and green cloth side by side on ironing board (3) put about 2 inches of cleaner on white cloth and move iron in circular motion. Iron is cleaned. (4) Now move iron on green cloth to remove any residual cleaner. And finally I cleaned iron with steam bursts just in case any cleaner is trapped in steam holes. Cleaning Clothes can be washed in laundry.Only reason for taking out one star is the price of the kit. It is quite excessive for what you get.",
