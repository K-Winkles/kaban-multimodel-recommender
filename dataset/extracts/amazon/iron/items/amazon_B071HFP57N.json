This iron had good simple and helpful features, a large sole plate with a LOT of steam holes so it really blasts the garment good. (My husband has awful mystery fabric FR work shirts that resist all pressing techniques.) This iron really made them look nice. It has weight to it and feels good in the hand. The weight gives more balance so it stays put when set down. Hope I never have to buy another. The price was good too.",

I cried when I unplugged it as it had done such a great job for me for so long.Yeah it\u2019s been 15 years since I looked at irons but WHOOOAA NELLIE dayum they got pricey too!!! SHEESH!!! $120 for an iron?!?! Gasp! Oh how I missed my Rowenta! So I did a little research and this new name Beautral kept coming up. Then I looked at the reviews here and they were very good! The iron had all the features I needed which was basically steam, a cord, and a good price!When I got it though I was truly VERY pleasantly surprised!!! It\u2019s a very lightweight iron, but the ceramic plate irons like it\u2019s made of true iron! You don\u2019t want to put much pressure on this guy\u2014it will give you a warning if you do\u2014as you don\u2019t need to! Just a little time, a few swipes and it\u2019s wrinkle free!The water tank on this iron is HUGE! If you iron a lot of cottons like I do then you\u2019ll love this! The only drag is that the refill jar included is very small, and the refill hole is also very small. With practice it\u2019s easy now.I haven\u2019t tried using this with vertical steam, but I sure would like to as the steam that comes out of this iron is amazing! It\u2019s hands-down a big upgrade over my old Rowenta! Plus I think I paid less for it than I did for the Rowenta 15 years ago.",

                "reviewText": "After almost 4 years to the day of what was probably the best iron I ever purchased (no leaks, fast heating, smooth sole plate) it finally happened . . . the dreaded error 2. The Iron displayed error 2, beeped and would no longer heat. So having read there is no way to fix the iron when this issue occurs, the iron went in the garbage but I did purchase the exact same model again. Hopefully this one will have a longer life. It was good while it lasted.",

                "reviewText": "Every so often, I need a new iron because my \"old faithful\" is too tired to tackle tough wrinkles or make crisp creases when folding multiple layers of fabric. It's sad, but it happens. I have always chosen name-brand irons (Hamilton Beach, Oliso), but this time I felt adventurous.This Beautural iron surprised and delighted me. It heats up super fast and is generous with steam at all the appropriate settings. The automatic shut-off is long enough to allow me to fuss and fiddle as much as necessary and still go back to a hot iron, but not long enough to be a danger to me or my electric bill. The little screen telling you the setting is easy to read, and the beep notifying you that it's ready or that it's shutting off is one of the more polite-sounding alerts I've heard. It has a nice like cord (like most irons) and a very generous water tank.My only complaint (and it's small) is the heat and steam controls. I'm used to dials or knobs; I find them easier to manipulate for my 65-year-old hands. This iron has a button on the left to increase the heat and a button on the right to decrease the heat. In the middle is a clear plastic slide for the steam. Call me crazy, but the mechanism feels flimsy and looks as if it's destined to break first.Overall, I love my new purchase. If you're in the market for a new iron, seriously consider this one\u2014especially if you don't mind pushing buttons!",

It irons smoothly with the coated sole plate which is nice and it doesn't stick. The controls are user friendly so you can use them with your thumb onto the handle. The LCD screen tells you what type of fabric you are setting the tem for. Very nice. The handle is a little big with bumps on it for gripping. This doesn't bother me. The buttons for the steam burst and spray are easy to use and work nicely. The adjustment for the steam is between the steam burst and spray buttons and can be adjusted with you thumb as needed. The filling hole for the water is a little small but that's not an issue. I am very satisfied with this product.",

However, after having several Rowenta's through the years that always start leaking, and just not working well I finally thought time for a change! I searched for reviews on irons and as this one kept coming up with good reviews - I decided to take a chance on a (to me) no-name iron and I am so glad I did!! Now having used this iron for the last 4 months - I just love it. It has good water capacity, easy to use controls, good safety features and it just plain does what it is meant to do and far better than any Rowenta I have ever had. Love it! Amazing for the price.",
