                "reviewText": "The ion is light weight, holds a decent amount of water. Instructions claims to use distilled water. Personal recommendation, empty the water out if not using for long periods of time and self clean after using to keep mineral deposits from forming.The sole plate dose not have steam vents near the center. The iron cuts off fairly quickly if let set to long. It does an okay job with continuous steam pressing, the steam burst isn't very powerful. For quilters, this is an okay iron. The sole plate doesn't cover a lot of area.",

                "reviewText": "Love the design of the iron. Has a wide base so it doesn't wobble. It heated up quickly. Fabric easily pressed. No problems. However. Very disappointed with the temperature control knob. Not easy to turn or access, and knob is low, not enough height to it to turn once I have a grip on the handle. Love the color, love the style. But that temperature knob being an issue, it is not worth keeping for the long run. Redesign and I will reconsider.",
