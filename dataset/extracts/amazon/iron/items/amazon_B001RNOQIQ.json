                "reviewText": "Exceeds my expectations! Light weight and sturdy; I don't foresee any handle breakage; it is locked in and should not require any hard hand pressure for wrinkle release, just guidance. I initially bought this after my previous \"mini\" steam iron was recalled and failed after one year; leaking all over my work table. This Rowenta \"travel iron\" has been used a lot for quilting and clothes making. It is light and maneuverable enough for my granddaughter to learn on with guidance vs. my normal sized Rowenta. I have not traveled with it... It does require filling frequently due to it's tank size, but that is to be expected.Description says that tap water may be used -- I would like to state for the record that tap water of any kind is NEVER used in any iron that I have owned. I have only used DISTILLED bottled water and I do not empty it out after each use. Tap water will contain minerals and/or chemicals for purification and will increase the risk of white mineral build up from the steam holes and internal damage to an iron. I have never had any leakage in any of the 4 irons I have owned in my life time -- except for the recalled one that was defective (My first one in 1972 is still going strong, but a little too heavy for me now). In my opinion, the small price of distilled water outweighs the risk of iron damage.My absolute favorite quality of this product (unlike the non-compact version), is that it does NOT have auto-shut off after a few moments of non use. You must unplug it to turn off. In my experience with the Rowenta Focus Excel Iron, Standard, when in the middle of piecing quilt parts and sewing clothing, it is extremely annoying for the iron to shut off while I am sewing and ironging multiple pieces in succesion and have the iron shut off -- having to wait for it to \"wake up\" befpre proceeding to the next step. While this safety shut-off feature may be prevelant in today's retail setting, I as the user must bear some responsibility and unplug it after use. Thank you Rowenta for having this no shut-off option on this iron.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I are a retired couple. We travel frequently cross country in our RV to spend time with our children and grand children. We have had Rowenta full size irons for decades and we have been quite happy with their performance, but they are quite heavy for quick and light duties. So my wife decided to buy a light domestic copy. One after another, they proved unreliable and total waste of money.Then we came across this light, travel-size Rowenta and we immediately bought it from Amazon. It was money well spent. The quality is typical Rowenta; German engineering and all. It is so light even my 96 year-old mother could lift it and use it quite easily (provided she does not mistakenly put it in the kitchen sink.) No pun intended big Mama!The sole-plate is highly polished stainless steel which makes it a smooth gliding machine on all types of fabric. Lo and Behold we can also take it with us to London, England since it has a built-in current inverter which allows it to operate on either 120v or 240V for European or continental travel.It has this ingenious design which makes the handle serve as water tank as well. The handle can be locked up for use or locked down for storage. And surprisingly for such a teeny weeny iron, it is rated 1000 watt, which makes it ideal for very quick, last-minute-type emergency use.It has a very powerful steam engine for its size rendering it quite effective on wrinkled woolens and heavily wrinkled cotton fabrics, albeit, my wife says she would not use it on linens due to its small footprint and light weight. For that, she has the full size Rowenta anyway.The soul plate is so highly polished and so smooth that it will hardly ever need cleaning since we do not believe any residual gunk could stick to it. I would not recommend that you leave it flat down unattended on any fabric though; it is after all a 1kw iron, light weight not withstanding.All in all, I am happy with the purchase since my wife is so happy with the iron, and we have given it a 4-star rating. We would have given it 5-star had it had a more robust, non-plastic handle with a heavier duty locking mechanism. The current handle is the only weak point in the package. The German engineers sneeze-goofed only on this part ...Gesundheit!",
