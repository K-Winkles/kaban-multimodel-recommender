                "reviewText": "I am a guy who likes to my clothes ironed, neat and orderly. For most of my adult life I have used many brands and types of iron. For the most part they are cumbersome, heavy and not quite as effective as I would like to get the wrinkles and fold marks out.Enter the Black+Decker EverSteam iron and it changes the situation. First of all, it is a lightweight, not in terms of performance but just in its weight. Plug it in and you will notice the red light on the top of the unit turn on indicating that it is plugged in and powered on. As you turn the fabric selector on the tip of the handle and set it to the type of fabric or material you need to iron, the red light will start flashing until the thermostat determines that the iron is at the correct temperature setting and the light will turn solid red.Before you start using the steam iron and also after you are done with your ironing, it would be a good idea to depress the Auto Clean button on the left side of the water reservoir. This helps clean out the steam vents and remove any water deposits, especially as you have used the steam iron for a while.The handle also has 2 large rectangular buttons, one for fine water spray on the left, and one for a burst of steam on the right. You put water into the iron's water reservoir through an opening right in front of the fabric selector. You open it by pushing the cover towards the right with your finger. The reservoir itself contains enough water to steam iron about several pairs of cotton pants before it needs to be refilled. Make sure that when you close the cover of the water reservoir back, that you hear the clicking sound of the cover to be sure that it is securely closed and sealed.Like any new steam iron, you might notice some water spots on the fabric from time to time. This is normal. As you keep on using the steam iron you should see less and less of this.So far I am impressed with the performance of this economical steam iron. It exceeded my expectations.",

He took it with him to his dorm and it is very easy to use. Fill with water, Set the clothing material and he is ready to go.
