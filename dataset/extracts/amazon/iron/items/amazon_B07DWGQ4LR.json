                "reviewText": "After my old iron I've had for 15+ years starting leaking water, I searched for a replacement. I chose this model because it's not too big and not too small, and I didn't want anything digital or complicated. I've had irons with non-stick surfaces before, and the non-stick surface always comes off; therefore; I was interested in trying the stainless steel surface. So far, it glides easily over clothes. My last iron had a retractable cord which was tricky to retract and in recent years would retract if I bumped it when I was ironing (very frustrating); therefore, I was happy to have a cord that I could just wind around the base. Winding the cord around the base is working well for me. The iron gets much hotter than my old model, and the steam is good. Like all irons I've ever used, it does drip water at times. It's fine with me that the steam is automatic at high temperatures. If I ever need to use it at high temps without steam, I just won't put water in the reservoir. It is difficult to see the water level in the reservoir, but I can live with that. I need to put on my glasses and shine my phone flashlight on it to see the water level. It took me a while to figure out the rhyme and reason of when the red light comes on; it has something to do with the resetting the internal timer for the automatic shutoff feature. I would rather just see the red light on when the iron is turned on.",
