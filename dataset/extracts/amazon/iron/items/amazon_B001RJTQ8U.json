                "reviewText": "I want you to know I saved all the ironing this week for the arrival of this iron. This is one of the most inexpensive irons offered here at Amazon. It's also better than the others. After one overpriced T-Fal and one even more overpriced Rowenta, I am convinced that 1) some things are better left unchanged and 2) One should never fix that which is not broken. Therefore, I have returned to my ironing roots. This is like the iron I grew up using. This is the type of iron that never let me down. Not fussy. Not awkward. The right size. Not built like it belongs on a spaceship. And most of all........Not made entirely of cheap plastic.I can honestly say I am sorry I wasted my money on the expensive irons because none of them handled, ironed or made me feel as comfortable as Ye Old Black and Decker The-Way-It-Was-And-The-Way-It-Should-Stay Steam Iron.It does what an iron is supposed to do and, if placed on its heel (the way I learned how to iron), it doesn't shut off on you 15 times while you are trying to iron a batch of clothing and want to stop and do something else for a minute. If given the choice, I would really revert back to the old days when irons didn't have an automatic shutoff at all. I mean, if you are that ditzy that you can't remember to turn the iron off, well I honestly don't know what to tell you. I'm sure our lawmakers, instead of doing something useful, made some kind of law about irons automatically shutting off so that the person using it can be tortured. This iron does have an auto shutoff, and it's very fast and annoying if you put the soleplate directly on the ironing board, which is an invitation to scortching something. However, if rested on its heel, you have 8 minutes. This is enough time to adjust things or answer the phone without returning to an iron that's not hot enough.I agree with other comments that this is also a heavy iron. Correct me if I am wrong, but aren't irons SUPPOSED to be heavy enough to press out wrinkles? A heavy iron means you don't have to push and do the work when pressing seams or things like jeans. And if you are a cat owner, you understand when I say that I know for a fact that, sooner or later, your 20-pound cat Rodney is going to knock that iron right off the board. Okay, I mean MY 20-pound cat Rodney. At least with this iron and its steel base, you won't be sweeping up a heap of plastic pieces if it hits the floor -- and chances are good it will still do the job, just like the old days. I don't know this for certain. Yet. But heck, it's a lot less painful paying $19 bucks for another iron than it is buying another useless plastic oversized Rowenta.Listen, I would prefer not to iron at all, but barring that possibility, at least now I own an iron that does what it is supposed to do without spitting, sputtering and switching itself off every time I walk to the closet to get another hanger.Get this iron, learn to rest it on its heel, and put yourself out of your ironing misery. And save yourself some bucks besides.",

                "reviewText": "I don't iron my clothes, I got this specifically for quilting & pressing seams, etc.When I first joined my quilt guild, the more experienced members stressed the importance of 'pressing' vs. 'ironing'. Which basically means you do not drag the iron, you lift, place, press, then lift, place press, etc so you don't distort the fabric and mess up the block proportions.Although I have gone through three irons in the past 4 or 5 years, I never had any trouble with any of them dragging or catching on the fabric. With this iron however, it is EXTREMELY prone to catching. If I don't lift the iron way up off the fabric before I move it, it will do a Major catch on the fabric and it will kindof make accordion pleats/distortions that have to be re-pressed like crazy to fix them. And once I put it down on the fabric to press, I can not move it at ALL. Not even a little tiny shimmy, or it catches. It is especially noticeable of course, on fabric edges and seams.I'm not saying it's completely the iron's fault, it may be my technique. But I never had this problem with any other iron (whether mine or another guild member's) over the past several years. And my blocks have always been pretty darn accurate with my pressing techniques. So if you're a quilter and you think you're pretty good at 'pressing' vs. 'dragging', I'd say try this iron to see how good you really are! I don't know if it's the weight of the iron, the shape of the sole plate, or the holes that make it catch. Nonetheless this is my only working iron right now so I am adapting.Everything else about the iron I love. It is not huge, in fact it is probably a little bit on the small side, yet it feels solid and well built. It is heavier than my past three irons that were bigger, but it is not really too heavy. The steam function takes quite awhile to start working. You have to flip up the red button for steam, then it takes a good couple of minutes to really start steaming. Then if you push the red button back down it still steams somewhat, but not enough to be a problem. Basically, it seems that it takes the iron awhile to realize when it is supposed to steam and not steam. That being said, the water seems to last a long time, it doesn't waste steam while sitting upright, and it has only sputtered once. It gets nice and hot and gets my seams nice and flat.After going through my share of irons, I was contemplating a more expensive iron this time. A couple of the more expensive irons had a lot of great reviews, but the negative reviews were usually in agreement, which means there can be issues no matter what iron you get. So I chose this one based on a 'majority' of good reviews, the simple old fashion design (less features to go whacky), and the really good price. Even though I'm having the issue of it catching on fabric, I'd still buy it again. I'm learning to be Extra careful!",
