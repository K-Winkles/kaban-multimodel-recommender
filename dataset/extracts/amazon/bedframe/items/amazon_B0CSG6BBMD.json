Called Amazon and they gave me a refund and said I didn't have to return the bed. I loved the design of the bed frame but was worried about if I reordered I would have the same problem. So I ordered from a local shop and they put it together. Donated the frame to Salvation Army and told them about the issue. They were happy to get it and said they would try to make it work. Told them there was absolutely no give on the support bar or the hole in the wood. Could not redrill the hole because there is a metal receiver in the hold.Thank you Amazon for being so uderstanding.",
