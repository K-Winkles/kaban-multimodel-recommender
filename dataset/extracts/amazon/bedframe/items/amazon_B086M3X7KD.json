                "reviewText": "I ordered this particular queen bedframe/headboard combo because it seemed to have a slightly wider and taller profile than most other sets in this price range. And I prefer a taller, more prominent headboard.All parts were well packaged and exhibited no damage out of the box. No parts/tools were missing. Includes everything you need for assembly including the alan wrench and mini wrench spanner.Assembly was not as bad as I was anticipating. I actually assembled the entire frame myself (no help whatsoever) in a little over an hour and a half. Not bad at all. The instructions were especially clear and everything was diagrammed properly, which I appreciated.The wood slat supports were thick and sturdy. Once all was assembled, it just 'felt' solid. I did not mate this set with a box spring, but only a 12 inch hybrid queen mattress...and it filled in the gap between the frame and headboard PERFECTLY.I've now been sleeping on this combo for over a month, and the frame and headboard still feels solid as ever. No squeaking/wobbling/movement.Be aware this is a low profile bed, so may not be suitable for elders or people with back issues. As previously mentioned, combined with a 12 inch hybrid mattress, it's very comfortable for me to get in and out of.One thing to note: with the headboard, the wide horizontal slats may not line up perfectly on the ends after assembly. If that's the case, simply loosen the bolts holding in the affected slat, and you can reposition it as desired. Mine looks just like the picture now.Great looking set!",

I typically like a little taller bed frame and and a taller head board but those are kind of expensive for my needs rn. This is cute, easy to assemble, and sturdy! The clearance to under the bed is low, so if you\u2019re hoping to store some things under here theyd have to be small items, I couldn\u2019t get my small/medium tv box to slide under the bed.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Allewie Queen Size Platform Bed Frame, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This bed frame is not only stylish but also somewhat sturdy. The dark grey fabric upholstery gives it a modern and elegant look that complements my bedroom decor perfectly.Assembly was a breeze, and I was able to put it together on my own in no time. The wooden slats provide excellent support for my mattress, eliminating the need for a box spring. I appreciate the thoughtful design, and the headboard adds a touch of comfort for sitting up and reading or watching TV in bed.Overall, the Allewie Queen Size Platform Bed Frame is a fantastic product. It's affordable, well-made, and aesthetically pleasing. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a new bed frame.",

Bought it for our 3 year old and it seems to be a perfect fit for him. It\u2019s lower to the ground which is good for kids. We paired it with a 10\u201d mattress and it was a perfect fit. I wouldn\u2019t go less than 10\u201d for the mattress but it would be fine if you went for a little more than 10\u201d. Overall it was a good purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a queen size bed frame from this company. I was a little disappointed on how long it was going to take to get delivered orginally, amazon quoted over 10 days for it to be delivered. To my surprise it got to my house 5 days earlier then originally quoted. It came in a normal sized box. I opened the box to find an easy \"how to\" set up guide. There was a second box that had all the hardware needed. It was a breeze to put together. Total time for assembly was under an hour. Included in the the box was a note from the supplier saying if I had any questions or difficulties I could contact him directly.I have had it set up for 4 nights now. It is sturdy and looks great. It makes no noise and it doesn't move.I highly recommend this bed frame. I am going to reorder another one for guest rooms.",
