                "reviewText": "Needed a bed for the spare room. Guest bed doesn't need to be 2 grand so I bought this and a hybrid box mattress. Lots of pieces, and 2 hours later, ta-da! Its built extremely well, the instructions are easy to follow, and the frame is simply amazing. One issue, although there are 12 or 14 metal slats that are pretty supportive, I would suggest a baseboard of some kind for the mattress to be better supported. Would of been a five from me if it came with that. I do recommend this bed frame. Have fun.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice bed for the money. It was easy to put together, but it did take about 2 hours 2 complete.The only thing that made it difficult is the packaging that the screws were in by size came apart so I had to figure out what's screws went where. But it wasn't too hard. I also like that it has a built-in charging station and there's plenty of room underneath for storage and it does not require the box spring all you need is the mattress. They shelves on the back of the bed are shallow so they're only good for putting small things or a glass of water... it's not deep enough to put books or anything larger. My son loves his new bed and I love that he loves it. Its a win for us",

                "reviewText": "The assembly of this product was INSANE. It took me several hours and my fingers were absolutely raw and stained black from the assembly tools. You really had to put some elbow grease into it, because NONE of the holes lined up at all. The directions were downright nonsensical at points, and there are misprints that make you use the wrong size screw in one step, making you run out when you need that exact size in the following step. The overall result is nice. It\u2019s a sturdy bed that looks really cool.BUT: I do not trust the electric wiring of this thing at all. I tried plugging my phone charger into it and immediately heard a concerning buzzing. I can\u2019t lay my head down at night and hear that. Also the gap between the headboard and where the mattress sits is so wide that a person can easily slip through it. My giant pillows slip through almost daily.Otherwise, I\u2019m pleased with the purchase. But in no way should you expect high quality or easy assembly. It\u2019s yet another cheap hunk of particle board and poorly painted metal. But it does look cool.",
