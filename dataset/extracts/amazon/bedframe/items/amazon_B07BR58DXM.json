It's got a 7-inch frame and nine legs that make it feel super stable \u2013 no more shaky nights. It's a beast in holding up my mattress and box spring, and it doesn't even flinch under weight.Putting it together was surprisingly easy and required no tools.

It's modern without sticking out like a sore thumb.The best part is my sleep has improved big time. No creaks, no wobbles, just solid, undisturbed rest. If you're on the hunt for a bed frame that's strong, stylish, and doesn't break the bank, the Noah Megatron is the way to go. It's been a fantastic addition to my bedroom \u2013 totally worth it.",

My criteria was specific\u2014I wanted something low to the floor, solidly built, and reasonably priced. After much consideration, I settled on this bed frame. Setting up the frame was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and all the components fit together seamlessly, making the assembly process smooth and hassle-free.It\u2019s well-made, sturdy, and provides a solid foundation for my mattress and box spring. The bottom of the box spring sits comfortably 7 inches off the floor, bringing the total height of the bed to 25 inches\u2014just the way I like it!**Middle Leg Placement**One aspect I hadn\u2019t considered was the placement of the middle legs. While they are visible in the product photos, I didn\u2019t fully grasp the implications of their positioning until I had a couple of midnight encounters with them. I also bumped into them while making the bed. Since then, I have learned to navigate around them and their placement is no longer an issue for me.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very sturdy and easy-to-assemble bed frame. However, there is one very annoying and actually painful design flaw.The frame has nine legs, one in each corner, one at the mid-point of each of the four sides, and one in the very center. The legs have dolts which screw into the frame parts and secure the sections to one another. Very clever and effective, sturdy.But, the leg at the center of each side is perfectly positioned to stub your toes on when getting into bed, changing sheets, or making the bed.This design flaw could have been engineered out by using an actual bolt at the same position, and securing these two legs several inches inward, on the crosspiece.I installed AC pipe insulation to provide cushioning for my sore toes. See photos. This is helpful, but it\u2019s still annoying.",
