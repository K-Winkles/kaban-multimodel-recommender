                "reviewText": "This bed is so much sturdier than I expected. The box is very long and quite heavy, need two people to move it but it\u2019s packaged very well. The bed was relatively easy to put together, with a few minor issues to note. Two of the pieces were labeled incorrectly which caused me to have to take it apart again and swap them. When attaching the legs to the headboard, make sure the holes in the legs are facing the outside edge of the bed. If they are not facing correctly, yours may be mislabeled as well so you will want to watch the holes on the diagram when putting it together. Other than that, bed was super easy to assemble. If you have a drill with a hex head the assembly goes much faster. Overall, extremely pleased with the quality, look, and overall value. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great for $, but HEAVY & Semi-Difficult to assemble without help!",
                "reviewText": "For the cost, this was a great purchase. I was worried when I realized how heavy the box was(BIG 100ish lbs) Some reviews said parts were missing & customer service required them to return the entire shipment back, and/or weren\u2019t very helpful in sending missing items either quickly or at all. The way this box was packaged, there would have been NO WAY to pull every item out to check for missing parts & then repackage it how it came, get it to a return store with hope the next one wouldn\u2019t encounter the same issue. I think it would have been better if parts were shipped in two smaller boxes. Needed a hand truck to move myself so if you have stairs or live in an apartment.. consider building the parts first then moving it piece by piece.LUCKILY, I had every piece & I\u2019m very happy with the quality at this price point. I ordered a Gray Queen frame. Assembly by myself took about 3.5-4hrs. If I had an extra person, I think full build would\u2019ve been 1.5hrs. Every bolt is hand cranked, & lot of screws with the included Allen wrench. Wish I could have used a drill.. but instructions we\u2019re pretty clear cut & easy to follow. NEED to use them.Can\u2019t give a full 5 stars because 1) I haven\u2019t filled the under the bed drawers yet. On carpet & with the strange little drawer latch holes, & metal wire baskets, not sure if I\u2019ll get annoyed to store daily items like clothes or just use them for occasional storage. I feel like the latch holes could be designed better? The drawers aren\u2019t on tracks. They just kind of float flush to the edge of the frame. 2) wooden slats are VERY cheap. Almost balsa wood I think? Putting the plastic connector ends on caused some splitting.. and a few splinters. stronger wood & end connectors would make it way better. Not confident in long term use that they\u2019ll hold up or survive multiple disassembly, but does the job for now.Future moves will 100% be easier than first time build. I plan on keeping this for a guest bedroom down the road. Would be great for older kids to young adults like myself. Too much weight or jumping/ bouncing may not hold up long term, but for under $200 & a couple years of use for a cute bed frame.. definitely would recommend. (If you\u2019re willing to take the 30% risk of a big item that\u2019s near impossible to return if it shows up to you with missing parts or damage.) Also, it\u2019s low to the ground, so if you\u2019re into higher beds or use a box frames, this product probably won\u2019t be a good fit for you. Overall, great bed for the money. Just be aware of your needs. Felt like I was gambling $200 to either receive a good deal or a major headache & CS nightmare.. haha",

The only thing I think was a bit cheap was the drawers. They are wire and very cheap feeling, but that's really the only flaw that I can see. I would recommend the bed however. Its still great for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The price is decent for a king size bed, and it's sturdy and the quality is good as well. The only downside is there were missing pieces in the product so we cannot assemble the drawers fully. We contacted the brand owner and they responded very slow (2 -3 days) and asked us for the order number, we gave the Amazon order number (that's the only one we have) and they responded please contact Amazon. Amazon shipped another bed w/o any cost to us and we got the missing pieces and then Amazon picked up the 2nd bed. It just a big hassle to move the bed up and down to our 9th floor. Pretty satisfied on How Amazon responded to this case but feel disappointed to the brand owner.",
