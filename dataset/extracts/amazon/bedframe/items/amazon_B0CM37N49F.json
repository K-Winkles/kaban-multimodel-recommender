                "reviewText": "Love everything about this bed, from purchase, delivery, and all the way to set up and actual use\u2014 the bed is simply a WINNER in my book. The metal frame itself is sturdy and the wood panels don\u2019t look like composite wood at all. Assembly seemed fairly simple, didn\u2019t require and didn\u2019t take long to build. Delivery came right on time and all the components of the bed came labeled and packaged neatly in a long, flat box which made the building process easier. Didn\u2019t need any special tools either\u2014everything you need is in the box as my mister said\u2014but arguably some help with a Phillips screwdriver would be good too if you have one just laying around your home. It took the mister about an hour to get it done and I was pleasantly surprised at how effortless he made it seem from start to finish. Don\u2019t let the price fool you because quality was certainly not compromised for affordability. It looks like a piece from a high end furniture store but with a Walmart price tag, making it such a joy to buy and own.",
