Although there are many parts that need to be assembled, the instruction manual is very clear, and it is easy to assemble by following the instructions. I browsed many king bed frames on Amazon website, this king size bed frame and headboard look beautiful, headboard seems very comfortable and perfect for my guest room; they are exactly what I was looking for.It's also a very good price for having a bed frame and headboard both. The first King bed frame I bought on Amazon a few months ago was just the King bed frame, no headboard, I had to pay more for the headboard separately to match my bed frame.",

Some reviews say easy to assemble..personal opinion it\u2019s definitely not lol, will take two maybe three people at some point to hold pieces up, has alot of parts and pieces to screw together and you have to pay super careful attention to all the holes and way things face..even if it\u2019s the same part it can still be the wrong one because it does/doesn\u2019t have certain holes & you have to go back and undo all your hard work or you can\u2019t finish (learned the hard way) instructions do have pictures to help but some of the steps and examples become a little vague. moral of the story it\u2019s gonna make you work for it BUT for the price and the quality it\u2019s worth the labor.",

The frame has many parts and assembling it takes a bit longer than I expected, but it makes sense (it is probably not practical to make very long velvet pieces). Plus, the frame has extra support in the middle, making it more sturdy. There was some issue with the frame, but it was quickly resolved after writing to the manufacturer (the email is on the main page of the manual).Btw, at first I couldn't find part Z: it was stuck inside the box and I have found it by accident when I was tearing apart the box to flatten it before trashing.",
