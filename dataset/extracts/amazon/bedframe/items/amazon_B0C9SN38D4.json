My mattress did slide around a little, so I bought several metal mattress gaskets. They attached to the frame easily, and now there's absolutely no mattress slide.My original review from August 2023: I am really impressed with this bedframe, so far. It was a breeze to build alone, and I didn't need to use my own tools. The bedframe looked great when I was done, but it was simply hilarious when I placed my mattress on the frame. It is TALL. Frankly, it looks a bit ridiculous, but the extra storage is amazing. I can fit a bunch of storage bins under this thing. Please consider the height of the 18 inch frame plus the height of your mattress before ordering.The bedframe arrived in a surprisingly compact box, for which I was grateful.Please note: this bedframe is just about designed for stubbed toes, with its legs placed directly under the sides. Foam padding for baby-proofing a home is a simple solution. That's what I did after my stubbed my toe the first time.No regrets. Sturdy and solid, and no bedframe noises from moving repositioning one's self in bed.",

I'm glad I made the choice to get this. 16\" was just the right height to store things under the bed, and not be too high to get on the bed. Although, with a 12\" memory foam mattress, im not able to sit on the bed and have my feet touching the ground, but I'm fine with it. I use my bed to lay in primarily, and not to sit on.",

I had to purchase Non-Slip Mattress Gaskets from Amazon to keep the mattress on the frame. It works like a charm.--You're going to stub your toe on the \"legs\". Easy fix - I purchased 1-inch pipe insulation (looks like a black pool noodle) from a home improvement store (sprinkler section). It was about $4. Cut it with scissors and wrap it around the legs. It looks great and is covered by the comforter. It also saves you from adding money to the swear jar. And when you do kick it, it feels like you've just kicked a stuffed animal.",
