Which is what I did with this bed frame and let me tell ya, I made the RIGHT choice. I am a regular woman just trying get by without a handy man and that is exactly what I could do with this bed frame. From start to finish, this bed frame took me an hour to fully assemble. It came with all of the hardware I needed (except for a hammer which it doesn\u2019t tell you that you need, but you NEED it). It\u2019s pretty fool proof to put together and the directions are simple. I used the hammer to knock the slats into position because I don\u2019t have the best upper body strength but two or three taps with the hammer and they went right into place. It is tremendously sturdy. I did not have to put my bed frame on it, only my mattress. I have a king size bed just for reference. It is the most quietest, sleek, and sturdy bed frame I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m very proud of this purchase and if you\u2019re on the fence about it, JUST DO IT. YOU WON\u2019T REGRET IT. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful, inexpensive bed frame.",

                "reviewText": "Be warned, I\u2019m about 5\u20192 and with our tall mattress on the bed frame I can\u2019t just sit down on it, I have to climb up onto it. So, if you\u2019re short like me, then you might have to weigh that against how much you need or want the storage space. Also, because this bed frame is so tall, normal bed skirts don\u2019t really cut it, so if you\u2019re someone who likes bed skirts you\u2019ll have to get an extra long one!We have had this bed frame for almost 3 years now and it\u2019s still going strong! It\u2019s gotten a little bit squeaky but I\u2019m sure that could be fixed by tightening some bolts or something, we\u2019ve just neglected to do that since it doesn\u2019t really bother us. It\u2019s survived a move and was actually pretty easy to transport, even upstairs. The storage space is AMAZING! I\u2019ve been debating putting some of those wire grid cube shelves or something under the bed frame for added organization since they would definitely fit but it\u2019s great to put luggage and shorter storage bins under!It was pretty easy and simple to put together, so much so, that I was concerned about how well it would hold up. However, have a HEAVY, BULKY, monster-sized hybrid mattress and my partner was built to play American Football and bed frame has been AMAZING.(P.S. We needed to get a new set of pet stairs for our small dogs to be able to get onto the bed)",

                "reviewText": "I really like this bed frame. There are a couple things that would be comparatively cheap improvements, but overall I'm really pleased. It's not elegant, but it leaves room to make it nicer. It is STURDY and affordable.The good:- Great price for what you get.- Pretty easy to assemble. Whole thing took 20 or 30 minutes solo. Tools and spare hardware are included. Simple to understand. Side-rails fold out, so one less thing to have to bolt-up oneself. With the exception of the slats, all the female threads are welded on so you don't have to mess around with nuts and bolts trying to hold one while turning the other. (PRO TIP: put all the hardware together only hand-tight, THEN go around and tighten all the bolts for a better flush fit.)- It's SOLID. REALLY SOLID. While I was first putting it together, I thought, \"wow, the machining isn't great, the nuts welded into the frame aren't pretty - this thing has GOT to wobble somewhere.\" NOPE. By the time you get this thing together, it's a tank. I had to KICK the friction-fit slats into place, and they are not moving again without the help of a mallet. Oh, you can literally KICK THE HARDWARE INTO PLACE and it holds up just fine. I've got no fear whatsoever that this frame will hold up my fat behind no matter what I choose to do on it.- No squeak, no shimmy, no noise of any kind.- Really nice height. I'm using this frame with a 10\" mattress and no boxspring, and the height is nearly even with my old queen sleigh bed with boxspring. At 6' tall, it's easy throw-legs-over-side-and-I'm-up height. For most, it is also perfect, uuuhh, \"activity\" height (though I'd personally have to crouch just a little because I'm fairly tall - and if you have to ask you don't want to know). - I had concerns that the slats were a little far apart for a pocket-coil mattress-only, but the frame supports the mattress quite well on its own. This has a lot to do with the mattress too, and maybe a foam mattress might have a little underbulge, but so far it's working great on the pocket-spring.The bad / could use improvement:1 -The depth could be improved so a mattress is less likely to slide. The slats sit about 1/2 inch below the side rails. By the time you tuck a bedspread and some sheets under the mattress, the bulk of the mattress is at the rail height, so it cold conceivably slide. Mine is the king size, and it's unlikely to slide simply because of the weight, but a little more rim would be nice.2 - \"headboard\" and \"footboard\" (no board really, just top and bottom of frame) both come in two pieces and are slightly tricky to line up. A little tab on one side could easily ensure properly-flush alignment when bolting the parts together.3 - Top of the frame has holes to allow for bolting on one's own headboard, yet the bottom of the frame does NOT have these same openings for a footboard. If I decide to fancy the thing up by adding head and footboards, I'll have to drill-out the bedframe for a footboard. - I've seen some comments in other reviews that the corners stick out and are kind of sharp. Yes, they are. But most mattresses are slightly rounded at the corners, the frame is square, and the mattress fits INSIDE the frame, so short of some fancier upholstered bedframe or rubber bumpers, I don't see how to avoid this. I'm not going to knock it for that. Besides, I plan to eventually add head and footboards, so I see no problem here.Overall, it's a fantastic buy for the money and I am extremely pleased. Is the machining, fit and finish perfect? -no. But at the price point, for a frame that never gets seen beneath a bedspread, this thing is AWESOME.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Heavy Duty Steel Slat bed frame, not one but two, because I was so happy with the first purchase.The process of assembling the bed frame was straightforward. The steel slat design is very sturdy and provides adequate support for a comfortable sleep experience without the need for a box spring.I purchased a bed in a box mattress, and I have zero issues feeling the bars under the mattress.The sturdiness of the bed frame is the real standout feature. I would recommend this bed frame to anyone who needs a reliable and sturdy frame for their room. There are also slots to add a headboard or footboard later on down the road.Overall, suppose you're looking for a bed frame that is easy to assemble, sturdy, at an affordable price point, I don't think you would be disappointed.",
