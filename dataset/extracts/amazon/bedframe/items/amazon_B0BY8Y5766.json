                "reviewText": "This bed is beautiful! It\u2019s exactly what we were looking for to use in our guest bedroom. The storage underneath allows us to store, extra sheets and pillows for our guests. We had a small issue with some screws that did not fit. After getting in touch with the customer service department, they went out of their way on so many levels, to make sure our bed was exactly as it was described. They gave us options on what to do about the problem and even offered to replace the bed, then they resolved the issue within the same day and immediately sent out the needed parts within that day. It does take a minute to ship, but don\u2019t blame the company. We all know they\u2019re shipping issues these days . When you look at this bed, and if you question the durability, I add that the engineering makes this bed very sturdy. There are a lot of parts and pieces but once you put it together, you can see how one piece fits to another to actually give you a very secure stable product. One question I considered when purchasing was if I could use the Tempur-pedic bed without the box for the Tempur-pedic. The answer is, it works just fine. The bed fits well to the frame and because of the way they\u2019ve engineer the slats on this bed, it supports the mattress very well and allows supports well over the allotted amount for a heavy person. I will buy from this company again and I would recommend it to any friend. It\u2019s a beautiful product it\u2019s well engineered and your customer service is fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this queen size frame for our master bedroom to replace a 30-year-old wood frame, box spring and mattress. We are combining it with a new BeautyRest \u201chybrid\u201d mattress since this frame does not require a box spring.We were very impressed with the quality of materials in this kit \u2014 especially the gray fabric, which looks like a linen upholstery fabric \u2014 and the precision of how the parts came together during assembly. The weight-bearing portion of the frame is made of steel, so it\u2019s very strong. That said, this kit is not for the faint of heart. While the instructions are very clear and well-illustrated (22 steps!), the kit consists of no less than 117 pieces of hardware and connectors, and 45 pieces of frame components. Plan on spending an entire afternoon assembling it (I assembled it myself while watching the Packers lose to the Steelers). There are lots of screws, so I strongly recommend using a cordless drill or power screw driver to save time and avoid wrist fatigue.Despite the rather lengthy assembly time required, this Anctor bed frame is a great value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "This bed is great. what a great deal for the money. got the FULL size for my daughters 11th birthday. love the plugs and the USB port is super convenient. The pockets on each side of the headboard are great for storing remotes, phone or extra charging cords so they don't get lost. my daughter loves this bed. We paired it with a ZINUS 10 inch foam and spring mattress, which was also such a good deal. went with 10inch because i wasn't sure if 12 inch would sit too high up on the headboard. Definity could have gotten the 12 inch and been ok, there is a slight gap with the 10inch which is easily fixed with a headboard wedge pillow. No box sprig is needed with this. The drawers under the bed are great too, they aren't the sturdiest or meant for storing a lot of stuff, but like extra sheets pillow cases throw blankets, pjs that sort of thing they are great for. the side drawers you do have to lift up to hook into place so its secure and stays, but no issues there. over all my daughter loves this bed and so do we it was also super easy to put together took maybe an hour with myself and my husband.TIP: if you have a power drill it makes screwing the back of headboard shelf much easier. also if you have attachments that fit the allen style screws (majority is with an allen wrench, which is provided) makes tightening each one of those to make sure they're tight & secure so much easier.OVERALL HIGHLY RECOMEND!",

                "reviewText": "The bed itself is absolutely beautiful. Some of the screws however, specifically on the headboard were difficult to screw in as they would tighten, and then loosen. So half of my headboard is not tightened properly. There were some issues with other screws as well, but not like the headboard. I would be worried about moving the bed. My cats like that they can sit on the top. Other than the screws and it being a bit wobbly, it's a good bed frame. The drawers are wonderful; be warned though that if you want to keep your cats from getting under the bed, and you have smart cats, they can move the drawers easily and crawl in and smack your arms while sleeping.",

The screws don't align to the holes properly. The #13 rail was bent on one of the screw holes and I am still not done. The bed size itself is bigger than my full size mattress by like 0.5 a foot. I wanted a storage and platform bed specifically so that my cats can't get under or in it. It's far easier putting together a South shore bed. I am a 46yo female with a bad back and so this bed has made my back worse. I would return it if I could but that would mean wasting another 5 hours or so dissembling it and putting it back in the box it came in and then having UPS come pick it up. I hope the Yaheetech queen size bed isn't as bad as this one. The metal keys they have hurt my fingers trying to tighten them. I have not sworn with the F word so much in my life and like I said, I still have the drawers to assemble. Everyone, save yourself precious time and just get a Southshore bed.",
