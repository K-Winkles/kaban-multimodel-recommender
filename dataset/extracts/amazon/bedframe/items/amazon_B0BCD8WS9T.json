                "reviewText": "After reading all the reviews I went ahead and purchased this bed frame. I am more than impressed. Very sturdy, makes no noise, and has a simplistic style that I was looking for. It arrived on time and was super easy to assemble. I was looking for a frame that did not include the headboard as I have a customer made headboard that I wanted to keep. This bed frame hit all the marks and I am happy I found this and made the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Was simple enough to put together with 2 people. It's stable & sturdy. Greatly expands the underbed storing capacity.The mattress doesnt slip around any more on this than any other frame or boxspring. (Just use some anti-slip grip liner if it's a problem)An occasional tightening every so many months might be a good idea for 225+lb folks... especially if anyone tends to toss/turn.Boards being on velcro straps is nice.***BUT***Though the support boards are strong , they're made of a flexible wood that bows with just enough give to create dips on each side & creates a hard ridge down the middle support beam. Plywood or 1\u00d7 trimming strips cut to fit are a fix for this. We half expected this due to other reviews. Even with the work/added expense, was still a good value.",

The Alen key that came with the hardware was a little short, and hard to use. I ended up using a ball end Alen key that I had that made it much easier. There is not an adequate way of attaching a headboard to this frame, I will have to drill a couple of holes in the frame in order to accomplish that.",

                "reviewText": "We were so impressed with this bed that we also ordered a queen-sized bed. Metal bed frames can be squeaky and wobbly, but not this one! The construction is heavy-weight and solid. I'm a restless sleeper and this bed doesn't move or make noise when I move. I LOVE the rounded legs. They are knee savers! I also like the fact that the 2 extra legs are attached to the middle support and not along the edges. Saves toes and makes the space more accessible for storage tubs. My husband was able to put the bed together quickly and without any issues. He was impressed with how well it is made. It IS tall, but I wanted the underbed height for storage tubs. I'm 5'3\" and, with our 9\" thick mattress, the bed hits me at the top of my thighs. I'm 72 and have no problem getting up on the bed, but if your pets sleep with you, they may need steps. If you are looking for a bed with storage, I would highly recommend this one!",

                "reviewText": "This bed allows for bins under it for extra storage that I needed. No center posts... so great for storage with no posts in the way. I paired it with a 18\" bedskirt and is great. I recommend this bed. If you want to attach a headboard, then no holes for that, but I knew that. I think it is important to note that on this bed the slats are closer together than other beds and makes it very sturdy for the mattress. I am very happy with this purchase. I also ordered the queen bed in this frame and very pleased as well. It is a little pricey for just a frame, but I needed it , so went ahead and ordered.",
