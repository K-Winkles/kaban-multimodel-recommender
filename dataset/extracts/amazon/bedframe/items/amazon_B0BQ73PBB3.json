                "reviewText": "So we just moved & needed to buy a bed & mattress. We went with this one because we loved the idea of the headboard that\u2019s what our theme is. I didn\u2019t really notice the reviews about how low it was because i got it during prime day & it was waaay cheaper than normal which was better for us. You can say this was a \u201cfast buy\u201d. We received it really quick & it was easy to put together i was able to do it by myself with a toddler \u201chelping\u201d me. It is very low to the ground but we have a two year old so it\u2019s perfect for her to get on & off. I\u2019m about 5\u20192 ish & it comes a little below my knees. After purchasing it i was reading the reviews for a mattress & we ended up getting a 8\u201d mattress. That just came today so we\u2019re sleeping in the bed tonight but so far it seems sturdy & like a good product. I just wish it was a bit higher. With the 8\u201d mattress you can clearly see the headboard. We have it on the higher headboard setting but i\u2019m sure if we lower it we could still see it. Overall seems like a good buy for at the moment eventually we might look into something taller but it will serve the purpose. I would NOT recommend for someone who has bad knees since it is so low.",
