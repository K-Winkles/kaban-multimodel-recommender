                "reviewText": "So, I had to replace the kids old wooden frames as they were starting to break. Hence I went with two of these metal frames. They came well packaged in a small box and was easy to assemble. I like them, but they were not without its Cons.Pros:- Simple and easy instructions- Easy and simple to put together. (matter of fact my kids put their own beds together)Cons:- As you can tell in the picture, once part of the frame had a dent in it, but not sure if it was during shipping as there was not hole in the box.Overall: I would defiantly purchase again and helpfully the next one does not come with a dent.",

                "reviewText": "This states as a tool free set up and that isn\u2019t the case. They need to take that info off since it\u2019s a lie. It comes in pieces you have to put together. It was also said delivery would be the next day and that to was a lie. I haven\u2019t set it up yet but I know for sure I won\u2019t purchase from this company again. Will update when put together.Update!!!After putting the frame together I can say it\u2019s nice looking. But very cheaply made. I was missing a few screws, and giving to much of another screw that was barely needed. The poles to hold up the mattress are just pushed in not held in my screws. If it wasn\u2019t for my two year old I would return. Definitely skip this one, not a good buy at all. Walmart had a no tool one needed I got for my five year old first and his frame not only was a price the same but actually didn\u2019t need put together and is very sturdy. I only got this one bc Walmart was out of stock. Should of just wanted for Walmart",

                "reviewText": "We tossed out our old king bed it was wooden and was given splinters and such. We found this because although we have an expensive mattress and boxspring. Having them on the floor made them feel like trash. This has our bed up super high \u201cby choice\u201d and it\u2019s sturdy beyond sturdy. It fit better in our small condo while we await our home purchase. I plan to keep it for our guest room after we move. I\u2019d definitely say I was a little worried about bumping our feet or legs against the metals walking past because it\u2019s a risk with metal bed frames in tiny spaces but we\u2019ve had much success and hardly any maybe one bump. I even ordered peel and stick padding to line the legs and edges. I am happy with my purchases great price for the product.",
