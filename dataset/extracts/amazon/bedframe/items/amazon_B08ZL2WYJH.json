They ended up sending me legs to the wrong bed type. So I ended up just getting a replacement and there were absolutely no problems with that one. It came super fast. Only one day. The instructions were very easy to understand and the assembly took like 30 minutes. It is sturdy and pretty tall so you can fit storage underneath.",
