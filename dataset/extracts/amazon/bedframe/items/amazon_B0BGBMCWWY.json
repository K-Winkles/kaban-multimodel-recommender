                "reviewText": "My sleeping comfort and the overall look of my bedroom have been drastically improved by the addition of the Molblly Queen Bed Frame Upholstered Platform with Headboard. This bed frame has surpassed my every expectation, from its high level of comfort and durability to its classy appearance.The quality of the craftsmanship is evident in the design of this bed frame. The upholstered headboard enhances the room's aesthetic and gives me a comfortable place to sit before bedtime, whether I'm reading, watching TV, or doing neither. The careful construction and selection of fabric are immediately apparent, and it pairs well with a wide range of interior design choices.The use of sturdy wooden slats is a major improvement over previous mattress support methods. The days of creaky, wobbly bed frames are over. The wooden slats on my Molblly bed frame provide excellent support and dampen outside noise, so I can sleep soundly through the night.It took me no time at all to put together the bed frame, and I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was. The bed's structure was simple to assemble thanks to the detailed directions and well labeled components. In addition to its ease of assembly, this frame eliminates the requirement for a box spring.The Molblly bed frame stands out for its superior non-slip construction. Even on hardwood flooring, the bed won't move or shift during the night because the frame is built to last. Its extreme steadiness is proof of the meticulous engineering that went into its creation.This bedstead is fantastic if you care about your comfort. My mattress is held securely in place by the platform style bed frame, which makes for a nice, flat bed on which to sleep. Since moving to this bed frame, I've experienced a marked improvement in the quality of my sleep, and I now wake up feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the day.The bed's solid construction is also worthy of mention. It's clear that high-quality materials were employed in its construction, and the sturdy metal frame inspires confidence. Without showing any symptoms of strain, it can support the weight of the mattress and anyone sleeps on it.In conclusion, I can say that I no longer dread going to bed because of the Molblly Queen Bed Frame Upholstered Platform with Headboard. Its plush design, long lifespan, and sturdy construction make it a wonderful investment for any bedroom. This bed frame is a great option for anyone looking for form and function because of its simple construction, nonslip features, and sturdy wooden slats. It deserves every one of the five stars I'm giving it.",

There is a video how to put it together and it was super easy. Just put our Casper mattress right on top, no box spring needed. Bed is pretty sturdy as well. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "We bought 2 of these (blue full and a pink twin) for our kids. Assembly was better than expected. I was unsure of how it would go because the box seemed very small. The packaging/shipping was very smart with most of the pieces stored inside of the headboard. Do yourself a favor and use an electric drill with a hex wrench bit on it and it goes even easier. They give you a ratcheting type tool but we had a drill available and used that. The first one took a half hour with two of us putting together (one working, one giving directions), the second bed was less than 15 minutes - so easy didnt even use directions for the second one. The beds are very quiet, very sturdy and beautiful. The colors/fabric are great. My son (age 9) guessed we spent $2000 because they are so nice. I would definitely buy this again and recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Looking at photos from other reviews, it\u2019s clear there are different instructions for slightly different models and I think (hope) mine came with instructions that had a step not applicable to the model I received. After hooking then screwing in the sideboards to the legs for the head of the bed, there is a step 8 in the instructions saying to take another screw and screw in from the back to front (parallel to floor). There is a hole there in each leg, but it\u2019s way too loose and there\u2019s nothing to screw it into other than the hole. We skipped that step and wound up using all of the screws (except the one clearly marked \u201cspare part\u201d) to complete the rest of the steps. Seems sturdy and I still see no purpose to that step, so it must be for a slightly different model or something they have since changed.Looks nice and other than the confusion with that one step, it came together fairly easily. It just takes a lot of ratcheting with the tool it comes with - which helps to reach some awkward angles.",

                "reviewText": "The cons: instructions were not great, but if you have a brain you can get it together. The only issue was the very middle connector bar. It was about 1.5 to 2 inches too short so it was pulling the bed frame in at the sides and I couldn't get the slats in. I just spaced out the center arm with washers, so at least there was some sort of support. Sucks not to have the middle bar, but the bed is still sturdy, hopefully! Product support sucks",
