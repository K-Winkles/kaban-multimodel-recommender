                "reviewText": "I will easily recommend the bed for its sturdy quality. The frame and the base is metal, the boards are good quality and the built in shelves save money on extra side tables. The charging port and remote controlled light are such a bonus. My daughter says it is very comfy and loves the bed.Also, my experience with the seller was exceptional. I got this bed for my daughter and even though it suggests using 2 people to build it, I had to build it alone. It did take me 3.5 hours, but I could do it myself. In the process, by mistake a whole box got ruined. Since it was a gift to my daughter and I was feeling guilty about it, I reached out to the seller to see if there was any solution for my mistake. I was so impressed by the promt, polite and professional reply. They asked for some pictures to be able to understand the situation better and very kindly sent me the required part.I was so touched by their professional and kind gesture. They were absolutely not obligated to cover for my mistake, but they still did it. I would have given an honest 5 star review for the product, but then the way the seller deals with its customers deserves an easy 10 / 10 star.Trust me, you will not regret buying the product or deaing with the seller. Per my personal experience, I will highly recommend both.",

I had a fairly easy time putting it together, but the adhesive on the lights came off with the paper so obviously- the lights wouldn\u2019t stick, but that was just a bonus for me I didn\u2019t buy it specifically for the RGB lights but it was an added benefit for me as my room is RBG light based but over all great frame- I\u2019d buy from them again",
