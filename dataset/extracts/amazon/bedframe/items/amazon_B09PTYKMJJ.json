                "reviewText": "The bed itself is great. A little confusing for those who haven't built furniture in a while. Super sturdy and weirdly enough, my mattress feels better. No creaks or sounds, it's solid! It sits a bit lower to the ground than I'm used to but whatever, I'm comfortable. You definitely need two people to put it together, at the very least, in the beginning with the headboard.The only thing is it arrives in 2 separate boxes. I was super confused and frustrated because I only got tracking information for one box and when it arrived with half the parts and said 1/2 on the side I was super confused and frustrated. Went down to usps to ask about another box and they had no idea what i was talking about. However, I called customer service and spoke to a very nice man who explained the other box comes ups because of weight issues, I guess. It just threw me off because I had no tracking info for the other box and thought I was S.O.L on finding it. He provided me with the ups tracking info and the package arrived around 4-5pm.Over all super happy with the bed, customer service seemed great, but the logistics of the two packages and tracking for only one was confusing. Probably just a me thing bc I never order furniture thats that big.",
