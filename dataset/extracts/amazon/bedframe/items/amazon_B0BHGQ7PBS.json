                "reviewText": "I owe the seller a 5 start review, because I thought they sent me the item with missing parts, because the shipping box is so small, only the size of the headboard. Beware that the package looks small, but all parts are inside the headboard. All parts for the sides are foldable. The material is OK, but considering the price, I would say it worth. It comes with spare screws. Screw threads on the frame looks good, no dead thread or lose thread. Easy to assemble with only 1 person, and the connector bracket has a quick detach design. There are in total 6 supporting legs. 2 come from the headboard, 2 come from the foldable structure for the sides. 2 need to be attached to the far side of headboard. These 2 are round plastic legs, and have spacer to the corner, so I don't worry about my kid running around and have her foot knocked the leg.Something to improve, the two side boards don't align with each other very well, but it doesn't bother me at all. There are some wood chips on the fabric, and even teared the fabric a bit, but not a bit deal.Anyway, I will definitely buy this again. It works fine and does the job as a bed frame. The design also makes moving easy.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, let's get real - this bed frame is short. Like, \"step right over the edge\" short. But here's the thing: I absolutely adore it.Why? Let me count the ways:Sturdy & Stylish: Don't let the low profile fool you. This frame is built like a tank. The metal frame and wooden slats support my queen mattress like a champ, and the sleek design adds a modern touch to my bedroom.Space Saver: The low height makes the room feel airy and spacious, even with a queen bed. Bonus points for extra under-bed storage for all my (ahem again) extra blankets.Downsides? Well, if you're a high-jumper, getting out of bed might require a morning stretch. And some folks might miss the towering presence of a traditional bed frame. But for me, the coziness, quality, and unique style outweigh any minor quibbles.Bottom line: If you're looking for a low-profile bed frame that's big on comfort and style, the Molblly Queen Bed Frame is a total win. Just be prepared to fall in love with bedtime all over again.P.S. Bonus points for the easy assembly! I had this thing up and running in no time.",

It is a little bit lower to the ground than I anticipated it would be, but I personally don't mind and it still looks very good and is good quality for the money. The color Beige that I got is beautiful and worked perfectly for my room. I would definitely recommend this bed frame.",

This will make it super easy to transport when I need to move. Assembly took maybe 20-30 minutes. Instructions were easy to follow and it came with an amazing ratchet tool that made assemble so much easier. The bed is well put together. So far ive been using it for 3-4 months with no issues. Worth a buy.",
