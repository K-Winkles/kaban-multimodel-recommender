The parts were meticulously wrapped and protected, ensuring that everything arrived undamaged. Assembling the bed was surprisingly easy. The parts were not only well-protected but also clearly labeled, making it very easy to identify each piece. The assembly instructions provided were clear and straightforward. The process was smooth and frustration-free. The instruction estimated the assembly time to take 1 hour for 2 persons, but I managed to put it together in less than 40 minutes by myself without any difficulty.Upon completion, I found that the assembled product matched the images displayed on the website. The Ted bed is very well built and sturdy. The quality of the wood used is good, and I think the bed should be very durable. In general, I am quite impressed with my purchase from Mopio. The entire process, its delivery and assembly, was seamless. And the bed is definitely worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "This is the most easier project so far for us. My husband and I were able to build the bed in just half an hour, thanks to the clear instructions. I only wish that they had included extra bolts and screws, just in case, but the instructions were so easy that we didn't even need them. The bed feels solid, sturdy. It has a modern design that looks expensive, but is actually very affordable.One of the reasons we went for this was the double metal support bars where others we saw came with only 1. It's well-constructed so it looks like it'll hold up well, as me and my husband both heavy build. The color also looks same as they pictures. This is the only bed that my husband has ever been happy with, and we both love it very much!",

                "reviewText": "We needed a queen bed frame for our guest bedroom, and chose this one because of the included headboard and solid wood construction. It took me about 90 minutes to assemble by myself, but I wasn't rushing anything. The instructions were clear, and the hardware was individually packaged and clearly labeled, which made things go faster. There were a couple of places where the wood had chipped a little on the bed rails, but they were in places that were not that conspicuous, so I'm okay with that -- but I'm not sure where the damage might have happened since the boxes were in good shape and seemed packed well. It could have been marred from the factory or during shipping, but that's always a chance you take when ordering online. The finished frame is solid and silent. Having the two metal support rails is a very nice touch. We paired this bed with a couple of nightstands from the same manufacturer and series, and are happy with them overall.",
