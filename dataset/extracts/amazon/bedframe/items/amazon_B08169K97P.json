                "reviewText": "I spent 5 1/2 months researching beds. Due to space concerns, I was looking for something without foot or headboards. I reviewed products costing 7-10 times as much as the Zinus Curtis. I researched quite a bit over this period of time while I slept on a mattress on the floor, including many Zinus products. I'm not exactly sure what took me so long in purchasing ,but wanted to be sure I exhausted this.As others mentioned, assembly is pleasant. It took me 25 minutes, and I took my time. It was at my door 2 days after purchase. The box is relatively heavy, about 60 lbs.I've read all reviews on the web for this, the 2 stand out negatives that have come up were bed bugs and legs breaking. I did not have any bed bugs. Is it possible the bed bug complaints were because their existing mattress already had bed bugs? Don't know, though bed bugs being infested in the 4 padded frame rails seems slightly ridiculous. I took the chance, and it was the right choice. The side rails in the package were completely wrapped in plastic as well.Next, there are complaints about the legs. It is true the legs are of a hard plastic, though I did not get the impression they are \"cheap.\" They felt solid and serve their purpose. It seems most complain about legs breaking because they are moving the bed. Or rather, pushing the entire bed across the floor on the legs. This would create tension on the top of the legs due to the floor working against the bottom front of the legs while someone pushes the bed. Doing this I'd expect legs to snap off, especially with a heavy mattress on top. Same with any piece of furniture with legs, especially smaller legs. When moving, get a friend and lift the entire bed. I haven't scooted my bed across the floor, the legs on mine are just fine.Not only is the bed solid, but it also \"feels\" solid when you get on it. Not the slightest creak/noise/movement. Imagine the bed permanently cemented in the ground, this is the the impression I mean when it \"feels\" solid.I am very happy with my decision to purchase this bed. Money wasn't really an object for me (relatively, I had a budget of 1K), but considering this bed cost less than 150 is such an incredible value. I was really drawn to the construction and aesthetic design of the gray upholstery. It largely exceeded my expectations.",

Quality as expected for the cost. Nice appearance, but not the most sturdy bed frame. Still 5 stars cause you get what you pay for and if you're looking for a bed that can handle a lot of weight or shifting and movements, this might not be for you. Perfect for a guest room.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great For the Money, A Few Quality Concerns Keep It From Being Perfect",
                "reviewText": "So let me start this review by saying this bed frame is excellent for the price, and overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. There are a few quality issues that I do have with this item however. So let's start with those before getting into why I think this is still a very easy purchase to make.So this frame is supported by four plastic legs on each end and a metal folding leg beam running along the middle for what I am guessing is just added support because the four legs seem solid enough. Here are where my chief concerns lie. Now maybe this is just my particular frame, but my welds on the two folding legs have some minor cracks like the person who was welding the legs had some vague idea of how welding works or they couldn't be bothered to sure them up before adding them to the set. I don't know what this will mean for the longevity of the frame and if it'll become an issue in the future. The bar alone did seem to support my full weight (200LBS) because I stood on it and applied a good amount of force and it didn't bend, creak or break.My next concern is with the wood that the slats sit on, again this could just be my particular frame but mine had very small chips and gashes (I don't think this will be an issue in the future because again it supported my whole weight with force and didn't creak, warp or crack). The next issue with them is more of a complaint rather than a concern, but there was also a ton of sawdust and wood flakes on them. It's like the person who attached them to the frame couldn't take a piece of sand paper and the minute or two it takes to grind them off (which I did immediately) and it makes even less sense when you feel the slats your bed sits on because they're nice and smooth. It's like there were two people assembling this frame, one who took the job seriously and made sure things were done properly. The second person just wanted the work day to be over and did the bare minimum.The next issue again isn't a concern but more of a complaint. Why are the side slats not deeper in the frame? They give you a piece of double sided tape to hold your mattress in place which is silly unless you never plan on cleaning your bedding or enjoy sticky residue on your bed (which would be pretty gross). They could have eliminated this problem by sinking the side slats deeper into the frame and making it a little longer vertically so your bed would sit in the frame and not on it.Now onto the positives, the assembly was super easy and even a little fun (that might just be me I like to put things together, legos were always my favourite toys as a kid). Everything fits together nice and snugly it all feels sturdy despite my previous concerns.The frame is also surprisingly quiet to the point where even with me tossing and turning, it doesn't make much noise.The upholstery is very nice and aesthetically pleasing, and there aren't any lose threads that I could see which surprised me again given my previous quality complaints and concerns.Finally the frame was well priced, for what I spent I wasn't sure how good of a product I was going to get, I bought this based off the reviews and I was not disappointed.So to wrap this long winded review up I am pleased with my product it looks wonderful and seems well put together even with my few concerns, as I have said multiple times now this is a great product for the money you spend and I don't think you can go wrong buying it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had my fair share of hit-or-miss experiences with furniture purchases on Amazon, but the ZINUS Curtis Upholstered Platform Bed Frame is definitely one of the best buys I've made. From the moment I started assembling it, I knew I was in for a treat.First and foremost, this bed frame is incredibly easy to put together. The included instructions are clear and straightforward, and what truly sets it apart is the ratchet tool that comes with it. The ratchet made assembly a breeze. All the screws are in place, except for two of them so assembly is extremely easy.Once assembled, the sturdiness of the bed frame really impressed me. It feels rock-solid and stable, providing a reliable foundation for my mattress. There's no squeaking or wobbling \u2013 just a sturdy and reliable platform for a good night's sleep.Overall, the Bed Frame has exceeded my expectations. It's easy to put together, exceptionally sturdy, and comes with a handy ratchet tool that simplifies assembly. If you've had your share of furniture disappointments on Amazon like I have, this bed frame will restore your faith in online furniture shopping.
