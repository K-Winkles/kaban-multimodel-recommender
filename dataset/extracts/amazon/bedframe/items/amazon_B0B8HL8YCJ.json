                "reviewText": "I'm a big guy with bad knees so I needed a frame that gets me to chair level. I also needed a frame that would hold solid with my weight. This bedframe went together without looking at the instructions, and other than the included hex key, the only tool I used was a wirecutter to snip the zip ties holding the slats together in a bunch. It was packed very well, and only needed the included eight bolts to assemble. Assembly took me about twenty minutes total (working in a cramped space). As far as being strong, I have slept on it several nights now, and it is rock-solid--no creaking or shifting at all. I am very pleased.I cannot vouch for the 3500# weight limit, but I am over 300# and it is plenty strong. I also shift position many times per night, and have never noticed the bedframe moving or making noise.UPDATE: As I stated, I shift position several times per night, and that is where the problem started. I rolled over and heard a metallic clang. Looked under the bed, and two slats were lying on the floor with a third partly on the floor. Not a total deal-breaker, but I will be zip-tying the slats to the frame to avoid (I hope) any future issues. The frame still seems plenty strong, even with three slats no longer connected. I still recommend the frame, but be aware, if you are an active sleeper, watch for this issue.",

                "reviewText": "We absolutely love this frame so much I bought an extra one for our guest room and they asked for the link after I said it was from Amazon. I am also now considering buying one for our bed. My son is 6\u20192, 210 lbs and this was for his bed so I was hesitant to order online. We read all the reviews and this one seemed to be able to hold the weight. All 4 of us are fat and my kids and hubby are tall so we didn\u2019t want one of those lower frames which would make it uncomfortable to sit at the edge of the bed or even get in and out of it daily. We decided to go with this one and I\u2019m so glad we did! It feels like it was made for my son. He loves that it\u2019s not low to the floor like the many they had in the stores but it\u2019s also not high. He also liked that it can be \u201chidden.\u201d When he put the comforter on his bed you can\u2019t even notice the frame. All four of us have laid on that bed and not even a squeak or nothing and trust me we are heavy.Overall we liked it, good quality, great look, holds up to kids jumping into bed. We ordered another for the guest room and they loved it when they were here and already put it up as well.",
