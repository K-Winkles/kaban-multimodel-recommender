                "reviewText": "I just got done setting up the bed frame. Good instructions. However some of the holes on the head board and the legs where crooked. Which caused the boards that support the mattress to not fit correctly. They call the boards the slat set. Some of them I had to lay over the side rails, instead on on the support rails that they provide. I guess if you have the right tools, you can make your own holes, so that you won't have a crooked bed. I do like the material and color. The legs are also sturdy. I tried to upload pictures, but not savvy with my permission settings.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted some nicer than the basic metal frame. A reviewer said it had a low clearance (6 1/4\") making cleaning difficult. Besides the 3 legs on each side, the king frame also has 12 legs underneath. While this gives outstanding support, a good floor cleaning means moving the bed. The headboard is the first assembly step, but be sure what height you want as repositioning it after putting it together is a royal pain (voice of experience). If you don't want any space between the mattress and headboard you will need at least an 11\" thickness.Assembly instructions were very good and the way the fasteners were packaged made using the wrong bolt almost fool proof. They said assembly would be under an hour, but it took me just over two hours putting the king frame together (not counting moving the headboard). I'm pretty good with this type of thing, worked at a good pace, and didn't encounter any problems.I really like its appearance, and despite the floor cleaning issue am very satisfied with the product.",

                "reviewText": "Terrible. Most expensive and cheapest made bed I've ever bought (young person). This bed makes Walmart look like Ikea. If you're broke, go find a second hand bed that's still around because this thing will break before you replace your mattress. Seriously. The cheapest frame at Walmart is leagues ahead of this frame.2hr build solo (man). A few notes, the wood is raw plywood. Yes, I got splinters. Yes, it arrived with cracks in the wood. Yes, the instructions direct you to screw screws into the plywood with a bent off screwdriver. That took the life out of me - use a real screwdriver. There was no reason for that. They should have been Allen bolts like the rest of the build, but no, you get to try and screw into 2inch of wood with zero leverage or grip. Enjoy.Inconsistencies... God. Side legs are uneven because the side supports are different heights - go figure. Base legs screw way past the end of the wood slats because the washers are set at different heights (see pics).Not linen fabric. It is polyester and it smells like absolutely rank chemicals.Don't buy this if you want a wood frame. The un-sanded wood will tear up your mattress. Just take the metal frame. It will be so much easier to set up and tear down, and it will last 10x longer than this hot piece of garbage.",

                "reviewText": "Went together fairly easily. The frame didn\u2019t square up quite right, so it took some convincing of the brackets to flex the frame to my will. The fabric has this awful smell of cheap dye and the warehouse it was made at. It is definitely sturdy enough to handle the occasional use in my guest bedroom. Sits very low to the ground, and without a box spring there is a large gap between mattress and headboard. You can adjust the headboard down the legs by repositioning the bolt pattern, or add a box spring to fill the gap. I\u2019m opting for the box spring to increase the distance from the ground, cause as it is right now you are so low you climb out of bed which isn\u2019t all that fun first thing in the morning. Overall though, it\u2019s nice looking, and serves the purpose for the space. Hopefully it holds up over time!",
