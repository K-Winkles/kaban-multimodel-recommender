The bars are supposed to snap on from the top AND THEY DO but only the top part of the bed frame the bottom part I have to snap the bars on from the bottom , and they snap off easily (convenient when taking apart and taking apart) but not if I\u2019m actually trying to use it. And yea I did test out my bed on top first and they still snapped off ONLY the defective side.",
