It\u2019s a little Hightower than my last one but got used to it already. Lots of space under bed for storage and robot. My bed ruffle fits perfectly king on king bed and looks beautiful because the frame is flat on top. I know a lot of people said the mattress slides but we are chubby people and haven\u2019t had that problem as yet and my husband is an active sleeper. I have a heavy memory foam mattress that I thought I had to replace already but it must have been the old frame because the comfort has been restored! Took my husband more time to put together than most reviewed we are not young but we\u2019ll worth it. He made sure to make the screws tight due to those reviews. Try it you\u2019ll like it!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this several months ago for my 6'2\" 230 lb teenager. It's a twin xl and is incredibly sturdy. He can flop on it without it budging. He and 2 of his buddies can sit on it with no problem. It was easy to assemble and directions were very clear (though he didn't even use them) and it doesn't squeak at all! Only thing to note is if it will be set on any flooring like tile, wood, vinyl, etc. it slides pretty easy. Some of the grippy foot pads solves the issue. There's plenty of space under the bed for storage, totes, etc. He has a rolling trundle we bought off here with a 10 in mattress and it fits perfectly. Definitely would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I really like this bedframe, very sturdy but not heavy. I would encourage you to purchase metal brackets to match the thickness of the bedframe to keep the mattress from sliding; note this bedframe is pretty thick so purchase the ones that support a wider width. Also, I measured the space from the floor to the bottom of the bedframe is about 14 and 1/2 inches but my floor is carpeted. Just note the top of the bedframe to the floor is 18 inches. You'll be able to slide anything that's under 14 and 1/2inches underneath easily. I also measured from the metal bed-slats underneath the frame to the floor which was about 16inches. I was able slightly lift the edge of the frame and slide two bins underneath which are 15inches tall. In addition to those two bins on the backside, I can fit 5 of my fabric storage cubes in front which are 13in wide and 13in tall. Assembly was simple, just be careful that the open-side of the notches on the bed-rails are facing upwards on both sides to slide the metal slats in easily. Luv the look; clean and neat.",

                "reviewText": "I got this frame so I could make a trundle style set up without the trundle frame. The twin xl size frame works perfectly for fitting a regular twin size mattress underneath. I got the 14inch high one and can fit a 10inch mattress perfectly underneath in which i just push/pull/slide the mattress in and out. It is directly on carpet so this method works for me to have without a trundle but I think a trundle frame and mattress could fit if the height and width of the trundle frame and thickness of mattress are considered. This will only work if you have the twin xl frame so that the underneath is wide enough for a regular twin mattress. That being said, there is about 5 inches of the frame that is not covered by the mattress on top since it is a twin mattress on a twin xl frame. I just used pillows to make sort of a pillow head board to fill the gap between the mattress and wall and it works fine.The frame itself is very sturdy and very easy to assemble (only took me about 25 min). The rounded corners are also great, especially for a kid's room. Kids have been jumping on it.. no wobbling, no squeaking. Very solid.",

                "reviewText": "This was intended for a queen guest bed in my office with the dual function of making visiting couples comfortable, and also being able to randomly wrestle with my 2 and 5 year-olds on the bed. So far it looks like we found the perfect solution. The rounded corners are great, the absence of a middle bar along the sides is very thoughtful, and overall we're very happy with the purchase. To address some of the other reviews:* Noise: This thing is silent. Of course we tightened it down nice, but I can jump and roll around on this thing without nary a peep.* Slat distance: Some people were concerned about mattress sag between the slats. There is a middle bar and the slat distance from that is about 5\", but it is true that the other slats are about 7\" apart. I guess it would depend on the mattress, but we got a nice Costco Sealy mattress and there is absolutely no sag. In fact, the steel flexes a little with the kids jumping around, which is more pronounced than any sag.* Max weight: I seriously doubt this thing could hold 4,000 lbs. Putting it together I would guess something more like 3,700 lbs. So that's a bit disappointing.* Bed shifting: We wanted the lowest profile possible since my office is pretty small, so this was perfect for us, it doesn't jut out at all or take us extra space. I will say that the mattress could shift, but we have it in a corner so we're not concerned, and also it's nice to know you can put the frame some place and it's not going to move or bend the support bars underneath (there are three single support legs down the middle.* Welds: Someone complained about the workmanship and welding. Psshhh. This things is built solid, feels solid, and the welds look great.Overall very happy with this purchase and it looks very well made and sturdy.",
