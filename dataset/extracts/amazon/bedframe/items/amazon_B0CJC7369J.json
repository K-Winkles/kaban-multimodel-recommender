                "reviewText": "Wow, I am honestly amazed at the quality of this bed frame for the price. I originally was looking for just a box spring, but came across this affordable queen bed that didn't require a box spring. It looks 100x better than what I even anticipated. The adjustable headboard was a great feature especially for the sloped ceilings in my cape cod style home. The material is beautiful and almost looks to be a textured linen.This bed frame took me about 45 minutes to put together on my own. I was even able to carry the box in the house myself. It is so sturdy, and stable. It didnt move around with my mattress on it at all. It worked great with my older mattress with a memory foam topper. The frame is constructed with durable materials, including steel and wood slats. The velcro bed slats were perfect and so easy to assemble.Also, I am so pleased with the under-bed storage space, which is perfect for my smaller room to help with organization.Overall, this Vecelo queen bed frame is top-notch for the price. It is such a great deal at less than $160ish. I would have spent so much more at a furniture store. I understand individual experiences can be different, but for me, I am so pleased!",

The look of the bed is beautiful as it is a design that can grow with a child. Overall I'm very impressed with the bed, design, assembly and price. This is my third bed from this company and I haven't been let down.",

                "reviewText": "Overall I am very pleased with this bed, however 2 main things may throw others off:1) The color on the listing on my monitor for the blue bed is very blue, like a royal blue. The bed's upholstery in person is much greener, more like a dark teal.2) The fabric stinks. This is common for fabric coming straight out of the factory, which means the fabric probably wasn't washed prior to being applied to the frame. If I did it over I would open the box, take all of the pieces with fabric out and put them in a well ventilated place for a few days to get the stink off. Be very cautious when cleaning, spot test it first, as there is no telling how color fast the dye is.Overall I like this bed. Assembly is not too complicated, the instructions required a bit of puzzling a couple of times but nothing outrageous. I applied a lubricant to any metal-on-metal joins and tightened them down firmly at the end to help prevent future squeaking.",

I like that back support is wooden and frame is metal making it sturdy. The wood slat has velcro so it does not skid which was a major problem in my old bed. I recommend this product since it looks awesome and is high quality on budget.",

I bought one similar to this from RC willey a few years ago and the quality is the same but this one cost less than 1/2 the cost of that. My daughter has an 8\" deep standard twin mattress and it fit great. The adjustable headboard will work if I end up adding a box spring later. Awesome buy for the money.",
