                "reviewText": "You hear all the IKEA jokes; I really think the instructions for this bed were inspired by IKEA jokes. We assembled, disassembled, and reassembled the bed sections multiple times. It took most of the day. The bed itself is a good platform bed. The lights are cute but glitchy and my granddaughter said she unplugged them. She likes the charging plugs being handy. The under the bed storage is flimsy. There are bolt holes that appear to be an option to fix the drawers to the bed, but no fasteners come with the kit. Overall, this is an inexpensive option for a platform bed and it holds the mattress fine. It looks good once assembled. It will try your patience to assemble it.",

                "reviewText": "I love the way it looks finished. It's just like the picture. I ran into some issues assembling it, but they were all manageable. The instructions have no words at all and some of the graphics don't tell you which way something should be facing, so I ended up having to undo and redo a couple steps. Wasn't really a big deal honestly. The metal tab on the drawer runner where you insert the wheel was bent in on exactly one piece and the hole for the screw was too long (excess metal) but with some leverage and a metal file I fixed those too and it worked great. My only real issue is the drawers being free to roll around under there... I expected some kind of track. I'm constantly straightening them after use. It's not a huge issue but a little annoying. Definitely got what I paid for. Overall, I like it. It's a nice bed.",
