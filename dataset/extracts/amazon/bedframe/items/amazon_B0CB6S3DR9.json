It\u2019s heavy and sturdy. I weigh 300 lbs and my husband is 150 lbs. I can move around without worrying about bending or breaking it. The outer box was damaged, but nothing inside was. Everything was in the box. It was packed extremely well and efficiently. It went together without a hitch. The instructions were simple and straightforward. My husband and I had no problems putting it together. Make sure you pay attention to the measurements. My husband and I are both 5\u20192\u201d So the size of this bed is perfect for us. When I\u2019m standing next to the headboard, the top comes to about my elbow. It is a short bed, but it\u2019s perfect for us. The drawers are spacious.

It is powder coated steel and reasonably heavy steel. I did not know what 'greige' was but it is essentially grey with some brown wood highlights. Attractive.PRO: well made and certainly good for a guest room. Attractive and has storage. Well packaged so little chance of getting a damaged product.CON: It has a ton of screws and took a long time to assemble. Each drawer has 10 screws for example. Although I never need help in assembling anything, this was a challenge for one person. The backboard cannot be easily laid down to assemble the parts and I ended up having to reglue the screw inserts. That said, I am happy with the product even thought it took 3 times longer than expected. The instructions are all pictures ... But I had little issues. OH, the is one unused screw insert on back of each drawer and it appears to be that if you put a screw in it as recommended, it will punch thru the drawer. Cannot see a use for it but thought I would mention it.",

                "reviewText": "Takes some time to assemble, but directions are excellent. Really sturdy and an amazing value for all that you get. It is so impressive that this was so well thought out and everything goes together very nicely. Only one item had an issue and that was the holes for the outlet screws were slightly off. No big deal. Got them in fine.Everything seems extremely well engineered. The wheels even slide into captive brackets and are very secure with only one screw.Only thing I wish it had was an adapter for the LED lights to plug into the wall rather than the outlet on the bed. It leaves the wire exposed and is ugly, but that is an easy fix to get a usb adapter.Spacious bins that secure and line up perfectly.Overall amazing value, we'll see how it holds up as a guest bed, but I don't foresee any issues.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Although this arrived 5 days later than it was expected, it arrived fully boxed and protected, it was a very organized box with clear instructions and the hardware was very nicely packed-I really really appreciate that. Although the directions don\u2019t have words, the pictures are very clear to understand and it was very easy to put together. I also appreciated the quality-the housing for the screws was metal, so I expect this to last quite a while and not just crumble under me one day. I expect it to last through a move, too. It\u2019s quiet, it doesn\u2019t freak or anything. I got the drawers under mine for storage, they fit nicely and secure. For $400 I think is a good buy. It sits lower to the ground, but I don\u2019t mind that. It looks nice. The reason I gave it three stars is solely because I cannot get the LED strip to work on command. I got it to work the first night I got it put together and haven\u2019t been able to get it to turn on since. I\u2019m bummed because that was a major selling point for me.",

It absolutely does not squeak or move on carpeting, but might move on hard surfaces. The mattress does tend to sink into the outside slats, something that could be remedied with a thin piece of cardboard or a heavy dust ruffle, and the corners do extend beyond the edge of the mattress but I haven't run into it. There is plenty of storage underneath. I recommend it. For reference, we are medium weight people and use it 5 nights a week.",
