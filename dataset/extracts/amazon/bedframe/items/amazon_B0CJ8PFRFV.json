Also a packet of the screws, a small tool for installing the screws. And extras just incase...That was kind of the company, extras are always a great addition to a package order. It is very well designed. Has a good weight to it, and the appearance is also really nice and painted with a good coating for protection. It was completely put together in less than 30 minutes.

When we put the two together it made the bed so high it was like you needed to take a running start to get on the bed!:). The bed was comfortable but it really looked funny and my bedspread didn\u2019t quite fit and it looked like I needed a bedskirt. Thought well maybe Amazon has something and well it sure did. It arrived very quickly and we put it together and Vil\u00e0. We have a normal size bed and it looks great. Easy to assemble. Super sturdy and fits perfectly inside bed frame.",
