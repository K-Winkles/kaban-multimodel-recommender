I had my eye on a pottery barn bed for my four year old that I just could afford and then I came across this bed that looked EXACTLY the same and at an amazing price. I got it and I am so glad I did!! So pretty and easy to put together. I don\u2019t know how well the metal would hold up on a heavier adult but it is perfect for my son. It does suggest a 10-12\u201d mattress and most kid mattresses are only 5-7\u201d so we had to get a box spring ( which the bed doesn\u2019t need or require). It\u2019s made very well and we absolutely love it!!! Fantastic deal",
