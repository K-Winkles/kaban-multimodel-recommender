                "reviewText": "First off, assembly will take half the time with two people, I\u2019d recommend that. However I ended up putting it together by myself in under an hour. No dents or damage to the frame when it arrived and assembly had very clear instructions with pictures. Sturdy frame, and worth every penny in my opinion! Perfect for people on a budget looking for something that holds up.",
