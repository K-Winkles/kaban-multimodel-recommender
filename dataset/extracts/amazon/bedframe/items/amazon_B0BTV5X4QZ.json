Assembly is a little timeconsuming but fairly straight forward and I appreciate that they include extra parts.In general, I hate styrofoam because it always seems to get everywhere but when I unboxed the bed, the styrofoam chuncks were wrapped in plastic, so there where NO little pieces floating around anywhere. This was a minor detail that made me very happy. Another detail that goes above and beyond is having the slats for into molds that snap into the bed, rather than using nails or glue.Overall, the bed seems to be of good quality and looks great! It reminds me of a nice hotel bed with the charging ports on the side. I highly recommend.",

I stopped before putting the slats on due to not having the rest of the head board. I would suggest getting a screw driver hex head. Trying to put it together with just the allen wrench they send you will take a lot of time. I'm glad I started one day and finished the second day so didn't feel rushed to put it together.We are very happy with the bed. Its sturdy and it holds the mattress perfect. The USB ports worked.",

                "reviewText": "One of the things I sought in my furniture while moving into my new place was functional storage\u2014I was downsizing my closet space A LOT. And, I have had the generic bed frame and box spring for years and decided it was time to upgrade. When I came across this gem, it went in my cart IMMEDIATELY. It had everything I needed, a modern bed frame with classy underbed storage and charging ports. And it shipped fairly quick! Note, it does come in two boxes, so don't expect to assemble it if you only got one box. Assembly required 2 people, so keep that in mind.My only qualm is with the drawers..... yes, they are super handy, but the wheels on all 3 drawers are constantly popping off because the holes are too big for the screws. At some point, I am probably just going to throw wood glue in there and call it good. A small price to pay for great functionality!Assembly difficulty was about a 3/10, the instructions were very clear and precise. I loved that it made you pay attention to the direction of the holes. But, without my friend helping, it would have been A LOT harder.I haven't tried the outlet quite yet, as I am still in the process of decorating and rearranging everything. From the looks of it, there's no actual outlet but rather slots for USB and Type C chargers. Which is great as I have a mixture of Apple products!Overall, this bed is super functional! I do not miss stubbing my toe on the metal legs of my old frame, and I can say bye-bye to the tacky plastic slide-under-the-bed bags! Throwing away the extremely gauche box spring and frame I had for years was so satisfying! Definitely recommend to those who like functionality and modernity.",

Well packaged with care!When there was confusion (on my end, I didn\u2019t realize the order came in TWO boxes on separate days) the seller was quick to respond and very kind. No issues and worth the money. Great buy!",

Not sure why there were so many little pieces that weren't put together to begin with which was never an issue ive had with other bed frames but i recommend setting aside a couple hours for this item when assembling.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with this purchase. We love the overall look of this bed, and the USB plugs on the sides of the headboard are very handy. It was fairly simple to assemble too. I did end up having one issue attaching one bar. I was unable to attach it with the correct screw the instructions stated. It seems something was wrong with that one part and the company very kindly shipped me a replacement for just that part. I was able to assemble it with no issues after that.My one complaint about this bed is the storage drawers underneath. They are very light as they are just fabric with metal bars that slide into the sides of it. I worry about its longevity. Also, the two shorter drawers attached to the bed itself so they do not slide out, a needed feature in my opinion with the drawers being so light. This keeps it nicely in place. But the one larger drawer at the foot end of the bed does not have this attachment. It\u2019s just loose under the bed. Small complaint for an overall good purchase for the price.",
