                "reviewText": "Package arrived with a few dings on the box. Upon inspection, I was pleasantly surprised to see how well packaged and protected the pieces were inside. No damage! I was really surprised to see each piece was real wood, with the exception of the headboard and footboard. For the price, I was expecting particle wood for the main pieces, but this is NOT the case. Each piece is clearly labeled and easy to identify on the parts list.Assembly: Took one hour to assemble by myself. I guess it helps I have put lots of things together like this, so I was able to follow the picture directions easily. Only issue I had was insuring the pieces were going together in the right direction, for instance, attaching the headboard. From the way I was reading the directions, I would have assembled it backwards, with the paneling facing the back. When reviewing the picture before assembly, it didn't seem right, so I flipped it around. I noticed this with each step. It could be the drawing or could have been me. Once again, experience helped identify it quickly.The hardest piece I found to assemble was the side pieces when joining them together. It is a tight space to work in, and must tighten both opposing nuts at same time. I found the tools they provided for this step weren't adequate to do the job together. I used one of the supplied tools on one bolt and a pair of needle nose pliers on the other bolt to tightened down properly. Both of these areas I have included the direction page in the pictures. I gave 4 stars on assembly due to these minor issues.Final product: The bed is exactly what I was looking for to put in my granddaughter's room for her visits. The mattress that we bought separately fits perfectly! No gaps to be found!As for the sturdiness....it feels sturdy, but time will tell with a 4 year old!",

                "reviewText": "We searched all over the internet to find a good-looking, affordable headboard. After a bunch of searching, we found this and fell in love with it instantly. I was nervous to buy an item that, at the time, had zero Amazon reviews. But, the piece was perfect for what we were looking for and it looked beautiful in the pictures. The price point was very reasonable, so we decided to go for it.PROS: The piece is just beautiful with classic clean lines and is the perfect height for our 6-year-old son to get in and out of bed. It looks just as pictured. The price is much less than other headboards that weren't as nice.CONS: As other reviewers have remarked, the instructions are very difficult to understand and do not provide the detail needed to make assembly quick or easy. We agree with another reviewer that it would have helped if Seller provided which piece was front, which was back, and whether front or back would get the screws, nuts or bolts. It took my handy nephew over 4 hours to complete. Yikes! Once complete, we noticed immediately that it was very flimsy, didn't feel sturdy at all and we were worried that one jump from my son would make it collapse. This is a result of the actual wood being light and not sturdy out of the box. Hubby got out his toolbox and basically went through the entire bed to make sure everything was tightened appropriately.We shall see how long it lasts, but for the looks and price point, it's worth a solid 3 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I never ever ever write reviews but I feel like I am obligated to warn others so you can make an informed decision about whether this bed will work for you. We had trouble right away but it took me a while to figure out the actual problem. I bought this bed last fall for my teenage son and it looked great but I didn't realize how flimsy it was. Every day the bed would slide over a couple inches and every day I'd slide it back, thinking my son was just moving around in his sleep and the bed was sliding on the hardwoods. After months of this I finally got down on the floor to look underneath and saw that the bed wasn't sliding at all; in fact it was leaning to the opposite side because the center support plank has a terrible design. Instead of one long center support plank, it's two separate pieces of wood that meet each other in the very center of the bed and there's a 2-inch square support post that screws into the two separate planks to attach them together. There are two more 1x2-inch support posts that get screwed at opposite ends closer to head and foot. This is a terrible design and is not at all supportive enough for my son who only weighs 150lbs. By the time I realized what was happening it was too late to return the bed so I've been climbing halfway underneath nearly every day to readjust the support posts back to vertical.After months of that, I finally decided to remove the heavy queen size mattress and turn the frame on its side so I could retighten all the screws. I also put felt pads on the posts since they didn't come with felt pads and have been scratching up my hardwoods from leaning all the time. I was hoping the felt pads would make the bed slide instead of leaning. Wrong. I realized today that the center support posts are now taller than the outside posts so now the entire bed is supported only on those narrow center posts and as you could imagine it leans over even more. The center beam pretty much busted this morning and is now completely useless. In fact, it leaned so much it busted the head off one of the screws. I've attached a few pics of the support posts so you can see the busted screw and how they've all been stripped out a bit because of the leaning. You can even see how the felt pads I put on like a week ago are worn thinner on one side because of the leaning. Also attached pics of the center support beam which is now hanging after having to remove all the posts. I wish I had taken pics when it was leaning.I've finally decided to reach out to the seller tonight to see what, if anything, they are willing to do. I bought the bed over a year ago, so it's probably too late for me. But it's not too late for you to click the \"next\" button and find another bed.UPDATE: I contacted the seller and was offered a partial refund due to being outside of the return period. I still wouldn't recommend this bed but I am happy with the seller's service.",
