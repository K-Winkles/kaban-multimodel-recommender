I decided to check out bed frames on Amazon.Boy! I\u2019m glad I did. I found this bedframe that was inexpensive and the right size. Best of all it was delivered within 24 hours, it was easy to assemble, study and easy to move. My husband says he feels comfortable knowing that the frame feels sturdy, does not wobble or squeak.Nothing fancy, just a good solid bedframe at a great price.I made a great choice.",

We have not used it a lot, but after some initial test, it seems very sturdy and does not make annoying squeaking noises. It also has comfortable height off the ground with plenty space under bed for storage we need. Reasonably priced compared with other products, but its quality seems very good as well.",

In my mind, that was questionable reading the listing and buying but after getting it together I could see it being a real possibility that that is true. The assembly was okay. I hate hieroglyphic assembly instructions but the ones that came with it weren't that bad. Assembly was fine. They even give you the tools and a few extra spare parts",
