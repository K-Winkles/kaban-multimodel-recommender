                "reviewText": "This bed frame was so inexpensive I didn't have super high expectations but I'm really glad I gave it a shot. It came in a matter of a couple days. The instructions were simple and easy but honestly I could have figured it out without them. It went together so fast, just a couple of screws and some lining up of the slats and it was done. Also really great that the slats are metal too so they just pop into place and it's done...extremely sturdy. 100% recommend",

I was able to put the king together fairly quickly and all the pieces were provided and lined up perfectly. Great quality for a great price.But the twin one was another thing...the bars did not line up and I had to put it together without some of the pieces and it's slightly crooked.I did not try to contact customer service because they would have needed to send a whole new one and that would have been a pain. I was able to make it work with what we had and we only need it for about 1.5 years.",

But the Instructions image was backwards, so took 2 people 2 hours to put this nightmare together because the orientation was wrong. But once we realized that, then it all fit correctly. I have absolutely no idea what went wrong. Seemed sturdy. One person (me) got on very slowly. Crawled to the middle. The second I crawled past the middle, BOOM. Crashed 18 inches to the ground in what sounded like a car accident, all that metal on the wood floor. Sent me into a panic attack in front of my kids. Back is HURTING. Now I gotta pack this crap up and send it back. No idea what the issue was. Be careful. It really hurt and could have killed our pets who like to crawl under beds.",

The frame is very strong and it doesn\u2019t slide around on my hardwood floor.It came with all the tools you need to put it together, if you have your own tools it might be easier since everything is so new it was kind of difficult to screw in the bolts with the tools they gave us. Don\u2019t get me wrong they\u2019ll work but it will just take a lot longer in my opinion than it would if u used your own tools!I love how tall the bed is, I got the 18\u201d and it\u2019s perfect! So much room for storage under the bed!!Very very good quality for the price!The box it came in is VERY heavy btw!!",
