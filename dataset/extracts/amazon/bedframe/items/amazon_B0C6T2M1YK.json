This is currently my favorite bed, better than home. It\u2019s sturdy, had space underneath for pull out boxes, and was easy to assemble as it only took two hours. I do wish the end was a little higher but all in all it\u2019s good for the price.I do recommend getting something to put in between the mattress and bed. I have a 5 inch memory foam mattress and when i sit on the bed I can sometimes feel the bars underneath, not always but sometimes.",
