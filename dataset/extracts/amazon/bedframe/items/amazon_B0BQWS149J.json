                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these and they were both easy to assemble. I did have one issue where you have to put one bar in between 2 other bars forming the letter T. The bars that form the top of the T pivot open and close (I didn\u2019t get a picture, so I\u2019m not sure how else to explain it). The instructions indicate that you can just put the bar in between the 2 bars that form the top of the T, however, it was too big. So I found a solution of putting the bar (the vertical line of the T) in between the other two bars while they were open, turned it over and just banged the 2 bars closed. Once I had that figured out, the rest of the installation was a breeze. I installed this all by myself and didn\u2019t need a helper. The 2nd one to install didn\u2019t have the issue with the T joint fitting at all.",
