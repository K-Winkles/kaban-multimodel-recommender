                "reviewText": "I previously had a twin sized wooden bed frame that did not come with it's own bed slats, so after a year the bed became almost unusable. I decided my next bed would be made of metal because I already knew it would be a lot more sturdy than my old bed, but I also made sure to check the weight capacity. Something I didn't do with my wooden bed frame. This bed frame came earlier than it was scheduled, but I didn't put it together until I had a full size mattress and bed sheets. It was extremely easy to put together, but I will advise anyone to make sure you are set on where you want the bed to be, because this thing is impossible to move on your own if you want it somewhere else in the room. It's EXTREMELY sturdy, you could jump on this bed and it wouldn't move (though I wouldn't suggest that if you're an adult.) It doesn't have a foot board or a head board but honestly, it doesn't need it. It's such a simple, modern bed that you won't miss those features. I would definitely suggest this bed, especially to those who aren't on the small size, weight wise. Great addition to your bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "Like my title says it was the easiest frame I have ever assembled. I timed it. It literally took 25 minutes to assemble by myself. If you are the least bit handy this will be a breeze. I noticed other people complaining about the screw size. I had no issue with them whatsoever. They are an exact fit. The only thing that came up that could possibly be considered an issue was that the part that was supposed to be labeled C was labeled G, but it is clear as day as where it is supposed to go as it is the only one of that part. I am a 250 lb man and after assembly and putting the mattress on it, I laid down and felt like it could easily support me for long-term use even though it was purchased for my daughter who is 10, who is definitely going to test out it's structural integrity over time by jumping on it. The extra height for underneath storage clearance is a bonus, which has already turned into a fort for her and her brother.",
