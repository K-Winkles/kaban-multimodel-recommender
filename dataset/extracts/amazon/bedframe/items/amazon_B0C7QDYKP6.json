                "reviewText": "My daughter wanted a pink room, we didn\u2019t want to go overboard and decided on accent pinks everywhere starting with the bed. It was the right color, a lighter pastel pink and not a super bright pink. It comes in a million pieces so it does take a few hrs to put together, it is easier with two people towards the end of building it when you have to get all the bigger pieces screwed together. It is sturdy and only needs a mattress. It is also a convenient height to be able to store things underneath as well. For a kids bed it does the job!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter ordered the full sized bed for her room. It arrived within the expected time frame and the box wasn\u2019t damaged. The bed advertises having Easy assembly but this bed was not easy to assemble at all. My daughter could not assemble this bed entirely on her own and even with my help it took over 3 hours to finish. All of the necessary pieces to put the bed together were included but the instructions provided could\u2019ve been more clear & helpful. After finally finishing putting the bed together, it looked very pretty. The storage space underneath is great for shoes, containers, etc. The bed is also easy to move around and reposition if necessary. My daughter is getting a mattress protector for a little bit more comfortability but overall she\u2019s happy with her purchase at the moment.",
