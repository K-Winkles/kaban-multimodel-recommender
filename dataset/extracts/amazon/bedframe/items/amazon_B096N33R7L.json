                "reviewText": "The bed is poorly manufactured. One leg of the headboard tilts inward and caused it to be difficult or impossible to make screw holes meet when there were any to meet. We had to buy extra washers and a drill bit to drill a hole to make it work at all. The footboard legs are plastic junk. The wood slats are rough wood-get a bunkie board or box spring or they will rip up your mattress...wear gloves when assembling or they will cut your hands. Some slats were just shy of too long to reach side to side and some barely made it...one did not completely cover the support on the side rail so could not be appropriately screwed into place. In many places, the wood is scored or marked looking almost as if the wood was going to split in those spots. The bed frame (full size) appears to actually be larger than a full size as one can see in pictures provided that the mattress (full size) does not fill the box frame. Absolute waste of money. I'd return it--if it wouldn't cost me more time, energy, and effort to take the whole thing apart and re-pack all the parts and ship back to the seller, which I imagine they count on. NEVER again will I buy a bed online! Absolutely disgusted with the complete lack of quality.",

The only thing to be aware of is that the mattress sits on top of the frame, so you really should get a 12 inch mattress max if you want the more modern lower profile look. My mattress is 14 inches and I really would've preferred the 10 or 12 inch. Also I like to tuck bedding and the mattress sitting right ton top makes it a bitter harder. It took my husband about an hour to put it together. Its perfect for the look I was trying to create in our little beach bungalow for a very affordable price!",

I will start by saying we did initally have an issue (we were accidentally sent a returned bed - missing 1 leg, bolts, a slat and instructions). HOWEVER, we were provided with OUTSTANDING customer service to quickly remedy the issues. This bedframe is gorgeous with a very modern upscale look. It's a little low to the floor but that's what I needed with my back issues. We did not use a boxspring but you could. It's sturdy and even with the obstacles we had, it wasn't terrible to put together it just took a little out-of-the-box creativity. All in all, we are very happy customers, love the bedframe and recommend both this product and the seller.",

The wood slats were crooked due to support bar being bent. Also several of the slats did not have holes for screws or they were slightly short so if you did screw a nail if would not be screwed into anything \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\u2026 Also some of the bigger Hex screws for the slats did not line up at all\u2026 no where close. In certain areas bed Is creaky and unstable. Super disappointed after all the reviews bc I think it would be great if the pieces were correct. Tried to contact Amazon to no avail\u2026 talking about sending a return but I have to mail this raggedy one back. Now who is attempting to ReBOX something this large from warehouse and then lug it down three flights of stairs and into my little hatchback car?! Seriously \u2026",

But can't complain much since there are few frames on the market for TWIN XL mattresses. Slats are solid wood, thick and sturdy. Channel tufting and neutral color will suit nearly any decor scheme!",
