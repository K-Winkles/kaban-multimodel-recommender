                "reviewText": "I received this product in fairly good condition. The packaging was fine, nothing was bent or missing, and the included hardware and tools to put the bed frame together are sufficient to get the job done.Opening the packaging, everything is plastic wrapped and pretty well protected so that you don't accidentally scratch any of the pieces.There are included instructions which are pretty easy to follow, essentially just match up the numbers on one part to the numbers on another part and screw the two pieces together. This entire process took me maybe 20 - 30 minutes to do by myself and I was taking my time with it. If two people were to put this together, it would probably only take about 15 minutes.Once put together, I was surprised by just how sturdy the frame seemed to be. It is well made and the welds on the pieces seem to be fine. As others have mentioned, the center supports seem to be the only area where some additional reinforcement could be needed, but so long as you set the bed in the spot you intend to keep it and don't drag it around on the floor too much, the center supports are sufficient in my opinion. The bed frame or platform, whatever you want to call it, is also the perfect size for the queen mattress I bought for it. I had seen reviews on other bed frames where some mattresses were too big or too small so the fact this was a non-issue was nice. Another big plus for me is that there is no rattling or squeaking. The bed frame looks great while providing a nice base for my mattress to be supported on.I suppose the only con to this bed frame is the lack of storage volume underneath the frame itself in case someone were to want to store things underneath it. You can definitely fit things that aren't too tall underneath but if you're someone that likes to have a lot of under bed storage, then this bed frame probably isn't the one for you. I wouldn't really call this a con however seeing as it is listed as being only a 6 inch tall platform, so there you go.All in all, 10/10 from me. It met all my expectations and ended up being a much better product than I anticipated and I would highly recommend it to people that want a low profile, budget friendly bed frame option that looks good and is functional.",

                "reviewText": "I am so very impressed with the Zinus Platforma frame! It is very easy to put together. Just make sure you TAKE THE TIME TO LAY ALL THE PIECES AND SCREWS OUT CORRECTLY BEFORE YOU START. (If not, you will probably screw up.) The picture directions are self explanatory as you simply follow the numbers. The only thing that is not explained (and I'm not quite sure how it could be explained in a picture) is as the frame begins to take form and you are working at securing the top side rails to the end rail, be sure at the same time to also align the opposite end so it will slip over the top end bracket. Otherwise, when you get to it, there won't be any play left to slip it together because the opposite end is already stable. (Sorry if this sounds confusing.) I had to go back and loosen some of the screws in order to have enough play to do this.Another thing that impressed me is the way the slats are constructed and fit. They are thick and sturdy, and are connected together with one continuous strip of velcro correctly separating and spacing each slat. There is a ledge on the top side rails that is velcroed on which you simply lay the slats down and extend the velcro, and everything is correctly spaced. If anything looks out of wack, just go back and check to make sure each velco has been fully extended.The slats give a nice firm comfortable foundation for my mattress, even better than the box spring that came with the mattress. Originally I had purchsed the 6\", but I felt like I was back in college sleeping with a mattress on the floor. The Zinus people were great to work with, and I exchanged it for the 10\".The 10\" without a box spring gives just about a normal mattress height...not too high or too low..., leaves enough room to store other things under if wanted, gives my 16 lb Havanese room to hide under the bed, and the bed's not so high that I worry about them hurting themselves jumping off if they decide not to use the ramp I made for them.Not only is the Zinus solidly built, it is also very good looking. At the moment, I am still using my old headboard, that I just leaned against the wall after attaching 2 felt squares to protect the wall. Seems to be staying put well. There is no way to screw it to the frame, although I am sure you could improvise somehow if wanted.Some month previously, I had purchased a less expensive 14\" metal frame from Walmart. Rather than having one slat across, they had 2, which ended up pushing the mattress right up against my spine, making my entire body hurt. Also, the slats kept falling off the frame, and in the end the legs of the frame bent because they were not made strongly enough. It was a disaster! Needless to say, I returned it.Zinus told me that their beds are designed in the US, and made in China. If their frames are any indication of the quality of their mattresses, I will buy their mattress next time I need one.",

                "reviewText": "Let's get this out of the way, I love the design of this bed frame. End of story. But there is more to why I chose this over other \"similar-looking\" products from Zinus.Steel beams are prone to sagging after long usage, especially when you sit up in the morning on the side of the bed. This, obviously, is not ideal. So, because this bed has support for the upper frame in the middle of the beams on the side, I think sagging would not be as prominent as it otherwise would have been. Wooden beds does look classy, but they are heavy as hell. Compared to the steel beams on the zinus bed, which are steel super heavy (see what I did there?), it is much easier to disassemble when I move.I wish the corners of the support legs were more rounded off, but they are not sharp enough to be a problem for now. I did not use the sticky tape to secure the mattress because I need to lift the mattress up while putting the fitted sheet on. nonetheless, the mattress does not slide around. I cannot say if the mattress would slide around, were you to participate in \"bed-related physical activities\", but I am more than happy to test that out one day. And when that day comes, I will let you know for certain.Quality control was excellent, nuts and bolts fitted in effortlessly for the most part. I like the fact that no tools at all is needed for the assembly.Assembly was very intuitive, but a guide is there if you need one. They advertise the assembly is under 5 minutes. I guess I am a dummy, or something in that neighbourhood, but it took me almost 45 minutes putting the thing together by myself.The final product looks minimalistic, and performs well. No groaning from the steel or the joints. No sounds when I roll around on the mattress, but again, I have not done any physical activities on the bed, so I cannot attest to that.To conclude, solid purchase. There is this envelope included saying I should send a thank you note to other people upon purchase of this bed frame. Could someone elaborate? I bought this bed as a bachelor, who should I thank? Myself? my employer for paying me for my time spent at the office? my parents for raising me right so that I could be independent, get a job to pay for the bed? I do the last one all the time, but not too sure about the former 2 though. Would recommend buying this bed frame from zinus. Will update if s*** happens.",

I figured it would have more wobble to it, however I was really surprised at its sturdyness. I figured it would have some sag because there is no Center support but with a somewhat heavy memory foam mattress along with my 185 lb size, it holds up great.Great value for a 18\u201d twin bed frame that bypasses the need for a box frame, and has slats that work great with memory foam mattresses.",
