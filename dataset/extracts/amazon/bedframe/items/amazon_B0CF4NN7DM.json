Very good quality for the price you are paying, and it\u2019s super affordable. It comes with specific instructions on how to assemble it (it also comes with some extra screws). It is so sturdy and would buy again for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Thought I was going crazy with this bed frame. Before ordering I measured, read the listing then measured again. I would have 1.5 inches of clearance to the door I was planning on putting it near and ordered 2. When they showed up I assembled the bed frames and one blocked the door. Read the listing and measured the frame and it was correct. Measured the room and now it was magically 1\" too big. They must have updated this product RIGHT after I ordered it. As of May '23 the measurements listed are correct but it's rather annoying that I happened to order it right in the middle of the update.Oh well. My guest room has a bed that the door hits. They'll survive.Assembly was easy for a single person. No help needed at all.For sturdiness I have to say I'm impressed. I can flop on it as a 190lb man and it doesn't feel like it's going to cave in. Unless you're BIG big you should have no issues.Decent quality for the price and I'd buy it again.",
