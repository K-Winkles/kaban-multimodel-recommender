                "reviewText": "I bought this bedframe for my 8 year old daughter and it is very nice. I just put it together and did it all by myself. It took awhile, but overall, it was fairly simple. The instructions could use improvement because it just has picture steps and can be confusing. There are 2 holes and screws that I couldn't get to go in when connecting the 2 headboard pieces together, so I left them out. I'm not sure how long this bed will last, but it seems pretty sturdy. It is definitely not solid wood, so the quality is what you would expect at this price point. I didn't like that shipping wasn't free with Prime. The velvet is soft and beautiful. There are also a lot of support slats that is a nice feature. I used a standard twin box spring and mattress, so it's a bit high and bouncy with the curved slats. The mattresses I have are also slightly larger than this bedframe. This frame is a platform bed. I personally don't like a platform, but this was the only available frame I could find with this fabric and style. It does work though. My daughter likes it and I also got the comforter on Amazon. I'll update this review after using for a few months.",

But the rest of the bed was super simple to setup & assemble. Only have slept on it one night but it seems very sturdy so far & the headboard is shorter than the picture looks but it works! We love it. I\u2019d recommend especially for the affordable price it is.",
