I'm not a small girl and my worry was that I'd sit on it and it would collapse. Never happened. Had the bed for almost two months and it's going strong. Assembly was quick. My Task Rabbit tasker seem to have put it together in seconds. The bed is a really great quality and I loved the fact that I don't need a box spring. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The worst product I have bought on Amazon. The frame is of metal and it came with such defects that it was impossible to assemble it . The fact is that it was bought for my elderly mom visiting my son in nyc in his new studio and the frame was bought specifically for my mom to make her stay comfortable . It took 3 days of constant negotiations for the seller to agree to make a refund .thank you , Amazon team associates, who joined our chats persuading the seller to make a refund ( the frame is not expensive . But the shipment is almost the price of the frame . The seller insisted first that the defect was small ( though we shared the pictures proving how impossible it is to assemble the frame ), then the seller wanted us to return the bed through ups office ( meaning that we need to bring it first ( heavy metal bed frame ) and plus pay for the return shipment to ups. We were not against returning the defected bed frame but insisted on arranging a pick up for it. Finally the seller agreed to make a total refund (though I do not see the refund on my account yet) without picking up the bed. Naturally, it was initially obvious from the pictures we shared with them that the bed was damaged. We had to waste so much time on communication not mentioning that we had to think of a plan B for my mom where to stay :;(( No gift card or anything like this for the huge inconvenience was offered , though even Amazon associate team, being a witness of the seller\u2019s way of communication and the damaged product, strongly suggested the seller do smth like this. I would never recommend this seller to be on Amazon platform. We are human beings and things happen , but the seller is supposed to solve the problems in a professional and prompt way",
