I would recommend glueing it in prior to assembly. Otherwise it keeps falling out. As far as the weight limit we will see how it does but the metal doesn\u2019t appear any thicker than any other options. Its hollow and supports are welded together.",

No rocking or noise when assembled correctly. It supports couples of all sizes. And one of my favorite parts is the ability to store containers underneath. The frame is tall enough to allow for ample storage space. It solves many problems all at once.",
