One thing that slowed us down was getting the vinyl/wooden boards to properly fit in the frame ends. The instructions were a little confusing for this part as the way the picture is oriented did not seem to match up properly. Eventually, we were able to get it setup right. It held about 400lbs with no problems",

                "reviewText": "I bought this without looking over the measurements carefully. I have a high quality mattress and 3 inch bunk board, and after assembling the bed it\u2019s got this \u201cfat mattress on a little bed\u201d vibe going on. It\u2019s a good quality product with semi ok instructions. Pay careful attention to head board and foot board assemblies and those are not pre-drilled. It\u2019s best to mount the bottom on the ledge then do the top part of each piece. I paid 180.00 for the frame, and I\u2019m using it in a guest room that won\u2019t really get much use, so it\u2019s okay but overall it\u2019s not the \u201clook\u201d I was shooting for. If this headboard was another 12 inches to 24 inches taller it would have been great. If the frame legs would have had a lower, closer to the door iptim that would have solved it for me, but it doesn\u2019t. All in all, use this with a thinner mattress for the best \u201clook\u201d.",

The colour of the wood is nice, and once put together it was very sturdy.However, after assembling the metal frame and attaching the footboard, we brought out the headboard box (everything is boxed separately and then put together for shipping). That\u2019s when we saw that the box was damaged (photo attached). We opened the box hoping the wood was still ok, but it was badly cracked (photo attached).We decided to send the damaged board back with a request to have a replacement piece mailed to us. We had already put together the majority of the bed and the headboard was the only thing left. This was in August, and we shipped the headboard back, but we haven\u2019t heard anything from the company (nor have I figured out how to contact them directly).We don\u2019t even want a refund, just the replacement headboard.Giving this 2 stars because of this, but would absolutely give it 5 stars if we could get the replacement board.",
