It's very sturdy. My husband and I both weigh 200 pounds and this frame hasn't moved at all. There are no squeaks, no noises. It supports both of us and our three cats. It's the perfect size for our king size nectar mattress. It's very high, there's so much room for storage under the bed. There's so much room that my cats have turned it into a hideout. I am tall and I like high beds, but if you're on the shorter side make sure you measure and that you want your bed up this high. I really chose this bed frame because of it's affordable price but I would buy it again for any room in my house.",

Mattress Firm had a similar frame for $250 + and it seemed way too expensive. I decided to give this one a try and so far I am very happy with the frame. It took maybe 30 minutes to assemble and I had no issues at all. I do like how we can now store stuff under the bed. Very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive product - best frame I have seen - buying a second one",
                "reviewText": "This frame is impressive. We needed a king size bed and chose this from the reviews.--Box/Delivery/Packaging - The box is not that big, but extremely heavy. You will (need a hand truck) to move it or, you can do what we did - unpacked the box on the porch and brought the individual pieces in the house and up the stairs in their smaller individual bundles. The parts are ALL labeled and put together with the strongest strapping (razor knife needed) and wrapped in bundles of same parts. There is a nice sealed parts cardboard with the nice labels of \"step one parts\" and \"step 2 parts\" so you can just open one part and get all the parts (bolts and nuts) before going on to the next part.--Assembly/Instructions - The bed is assembled in just 4 parts and the instruction and illustrations are wonderful. One person can easily assemble this. The do have a \"tool kit\" with one of those little wrenches for the nuts and an Allen wrench. Someone mentioned better tools, but being too lazy to go down and get \"better tools,\" I assembled it with the tools provided and it took less than 20 minutes. I did have to get (a hammer) to fully put the slat pieces that fit tight, so a tap on the top to fully seat them made it easier and faster.--Building was two long king side pieces with attached mid-leg. The top and bottom were screwed in with 2 bolts each on both sides. Then there was the top and bottom legs put in with 2 more bolts. There is a piece down the middle of the frame top to bottom with a attached mid-leg for the dead middle, fastened with bolts and nuts. Two smaller pieces going halfway across to the dead middle leg completes the outer frame. Then the slats are tapped into the welded holders up and down the long pieces of the frame. You are done.--This frame is solid and heavy. It is high which was necessary for my tall older husband to get into and out of bed without having to get to a standing position from a seated position. We put a 12\" mattress on the frame. I can climb on the bed, but I have a little step to get on to make it easier. (I'm 5'2\") and with the 12 inch mattress it is high for me, with this frame I could probably get by better with a 9\" or 10\" mattress, but the idea for us was a easy in and out for my husband.--Under the bed is a ton of storage and it is very nice. I bought a 18\" bed ruffle to hide the utilized storage. At one point, I realized I had to plug something in behind the headboard and I weigh almost 200 lbs, it was very easy for me to entirely crawl under this bed with room to spare.--Quality - we have this bed on wall to wall carpet, so I am not sure if the review would be the same on flooring instead. With my husband and I and 2 big dogs, this bed is effortlessly holding 500+ (people and dogs) plus 125 lbs (the weight of the mattress) without any problem at all. It does not move or flex in any way, it is solid under us even with movement and position changes.--We have a free standing headboard and no footboard on our bed. There are holes provided at several levels if you wish to attach a headboard or footboard to this frame.--Someone did mention mattress clips to prevent the mattress slipping in a previous review. I did buy them based on the review at the same time as we bought the frame, but they are not necessary for us, so I never put them on. I think this would be depending on the mattress you buy whether the mattress would sip around on the frame and with the mattress we bought, it was not an issue.In summery, we are so happy with this bed frame and plan to purchase more for our other rooms to replace older frames we currently have that are not as good as this one.",

                "reviewText": "The full bed frame 18 inches high easily met my expectations. It is very well crafted and quite solid. Packaging was excellent (but always a good idea to inventory parts before assembly). Tools provided is a nice touch, though using \"real tools\" does make assembly go faster. Using tools provide makes over-tighten virtually impossible, when using more substantial tools use care to not over-tighten and, off course, always hand tighten so as to not cross thread, particularly in the end pieces where actual nuts are not used. Assembly is easy and simple and refer to picture instructions as they are helpful. Chose the 18 inch height so very large storage containers could be placed under bed. Using a 12 inch high mattress directly on top of bed platform produces a nice overall height of 30 inches for adults. Mattress will easily slide on platform so buying the extra metal side tabs is a must (shop around a little on Amazon for best pricing). This is a guest bed, as such I would expect it last, basically forever. I am impressed with this product. This frame was well designed, nicely manufactured with packaging and instructions well throughout. Wish everyone would build there DIY products this well. I am impressed.",

Once it is together it is very sturdy, and it is light enough to easily move around the room. We bought the king frame, and our split king (two twin mattresses) fit perfectly. My husband and I have both laid on the beds for several nights, and it hasn't shifted or bent (we are larger folks). This is a great value for the price range.",
