                "reviewText": "Traditional box springs have been marketed with such features as \"individually wrapped coil springs\" and other nice-sounding features that cost the consumer $1,000+ depending on the size of the mattress. These box springs are constructed from high-quality steel that has been CDC machined so that the powder-coated parts fit together perfectly. Although the unit requires assembly and comes with a small wrench and hex tool (and even extra nuts and bolts in case one or two are misplaced), assembly goes much faster with a socket wrench. The box springs are shipped in a double-wall cardboard box, and the main components (a frame comprised of sturdy bars that unfold and fit together perfectly) are encased in plastic. The relatively small box (under four feet high) is quite heavy, so a buyer with back problems or the like should plan on using a handcart to move the box into a garage workspace. Once assembled the unit can be carried fairly easily because the weight is evenly distributed. When the assembled box spring is placed on the slats in the frame of the bed, about twenty powder-coated bars are placed in slots, creating a solid frame for the mattress. When the mattress is in place, assuming that the mattress itself is in good condition, the bed feels exactly the same as if it had coil springs--but at roughly one-tenth of the price of name-brand coil springs.",

I am glad that the cover leaves the bottom section open to allow for air flow. I would buy this again.**Update**This has worked out great. Our little one is autistic and loves to sit and rock back and forth with a heavy shift each time and the frame is holding up so much better than her old wooden one. We will buy this again when needed.",

If you aren\u2019t one to be in your bed often, it\u2019s perfect, but for my partner and I, it wasn\u2019t the best.",
