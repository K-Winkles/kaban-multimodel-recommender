It also has conveniently drilled holes for solidly attaching to a headboard.One down side are the frame's feet, the center ones especially but the end ones too. They are right on the edge of the frame and easy to hit with bare feet while making the bed. It would have been nice to recess them to provide some clearance that would save my toes.The other is less serious but it's very hard to move the bed once it's fully assembled with mattress and headboard. That's because it lacks casters and there's no way to attach any. It's not a serious fault as with all the under bed clearance it's easy to clean under it but make sure you assemble it where it's going because it can become a monument in the room.",

Once we got the battery powered screw gun charged up and pieced together about 3 separate bit attachments to create the correct sized allen bit to tighten down the screws with, and spent a good 15 minutes laying out all the one hundred pieces on the back patio before assembling we had it built in just over 45 minutes. Stubbed my toes on the center leg on the side twice in 3 days. Just something to get used to I guess.",
