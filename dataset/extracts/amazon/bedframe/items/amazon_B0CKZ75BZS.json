There are warnings on the product about the hazardous wood dust and chemicals, so I wiped the bed down thoroughly. I did notice dust covering every part and piece.No missing parts or any issues with the manufacturing! Overall, very pleased.",

Only thing that could be improved is better labelling of screws/bolts in the directions as well as specific spacing for small boards across the top bunk. Besides that, great bed and a great buy!",
