So, I needed to find something else.I found this frame and fell in love with it. Luckily it is as nice as the photos! The headboard is great quality and soft fabric. At this price it seemed like there must but some negative, but I\u2019ve had it for a month now and haven\u2019t had any issues*. Assembly was fairly easy. It also seems like it will be easy to dissemble enough to fit back out that doorway when the time comes.*My only negative is that the \u201cunder bed\u201d storage containers I had previously do not fit underneath this frame. But it\u2019s not a fault in the frame itself. I\u2019m sure I can figure out another way to utilize the space for storage, or get some new containers that WILL fit. Just fyi, there is about 6 inches between the floor and the bottom of the frame.",

The legs of the bed always fold and they are impossible to keep straight!! Without the legs standing upright the cheap wooden slates can brake and the bed sags! On the very first day it fell on my completely flat floor and the headboard tore. It has ripped the vinyl flooring of my apartment and will cost me god knows what when I move. Every time I have to move it the legs fold. Every time I breathe the legs fold!! I\u2019m currently struggling to clean underneath my bed and maneuver my mattress and it\u2019s just infuriating.O have purchased to many things from Amazon and have never left a review but I am so upset at this trash that I searched the my hundreds of purchases to write this review. Save your money and sanity and do not buy this disgusting bed frame.",
