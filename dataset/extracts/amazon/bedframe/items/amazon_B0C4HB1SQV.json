                "reviewText": "Well it arrived pretty quickly all in one long slender box pretty heavy when your recovering still from a broken arm and wrist but too bad' the instructions are straightforward all of the hardware you need is well packaged in a large plastic case and labelled took me about 50 minutes or so to put it all together with the tools they give you and a jacked arm and wrist. looks pretty decent but the headboard could bigger and a bit more padded in my opinion, as far as being sturdy i'm 6'5 abd about 280 ive heard no squeaks or noises or had any issues with it yet but unfortunately i haven't broken it it properly yet so i'll have to see how it goes after a few hours of activity on it..",
