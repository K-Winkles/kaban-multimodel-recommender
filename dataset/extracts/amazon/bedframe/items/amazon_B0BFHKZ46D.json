                "reviewText": "The frame is made out of a nice, subtly textured metal and painted black. I can tell it's hollow because 1) not exceedingly heavy and 2) it makes a nice sound when you tap on it. I ultimately chose this frame because of the elegant headboard, and it looks even nicer in person than it did online.I can't speak on how easy it was to assemble, since I wasn't the one to do it, but it's been a sturdy bed that hasn't creaked for me. I've also moved it around my room a few times (I like to reorganize), and even I (very weak), can easily push and pull it around. It also hasn't fallen apart or anything in the process, though one supporting bar on the bottom fell out. Putting it back in was a really simple and quick process.",

                "reviewText": "My friend girl's husband just put it together for me today. I'm 71 living with a chronic disease and several other health issues so I'm so very grateful for these two people in my life! I purchased this for my adult son living with a needs. The price was reasonable for a platform frame and I have not put a mattress on it yet because our staff is in storage in another State but he needs a new frame for his bed and I felt that a headboard would be nice, plus he seems to have issues with the basic bed frame for some reason, lol I have no idea why he's always adjusting his bed frames. I purchased the queen size because his mattress is queen size and only about 3 years old. I should have gotten him the full size because this size doesn't leave much space in his new bedroom since we just moved. This bed frame is very sturdy and not wobbly at all!! He did a great job putting it together!!! I love it and I don't think that when the mattress is on it and my son is sleeping on it that it will be any less sturdy. I just wish that I had gotten the full size and I would have saved some money if I had. I could had ended tables an a dresser if I hadn't been so for on his queen size mattress than I was trying to accommodate. Hopefully we will not have to move because it will have to be taken apart if I don't have movers that know how to put it on a truck without taking it apart. It might just have to be disconnected from the headboard and foot board and that would be the easiest way to move it. Anyway I don't think that you will be disappointed with the height or look of this!! I looked at the night stands on the sides of this bed frame in the picture and I wasn't sure if I'd like it but it definitely not disappointed in the quality for the price that I paid. I hope that the price doesn't increase because of good reviews. I'm on a tight income and we need quality and price too.",

The package with the parts was ripped open, so I had to sort things out before starting. Seems sturdy enough. We are just using it for a guest room. So far, happy with the purchase!I saw a review with a one star and a video. They are doing it wrong per the instructions. The instructions are quite clear and easy to follow. They are crewing things outward, but the screws go inward to the middle of the bed. Imagine screwing things outward, your leg would hit those outward screws and get banged up. Ouch!",

The bars in the base do not stay in well with just a mattress and the use of a box spring with a mattress would cover the headboard as it\u2019s not very high, I suggest using a bunk bed box spring especially if your using an inexpensive or foam mattress.",
