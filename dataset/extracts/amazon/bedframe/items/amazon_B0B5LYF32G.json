                "reviewText": "Good bedframe, easy to assemble. It took me and my partner an hour to put it together, and it could have been done with one person if needed. The LED strip took more work to figure out than the bedframe. We couldn't figure out how to turn it on, but our roomate was able to get it working. The only downside is the wood that keep the matrass up are very thin and break easily. We've already snapped 3 and are planning to just replace them all with sturdier wood from Home Depot. It's a very nice bedframe overall.",

I put it together a week before I left for vacation, I came back and slept on it maybe two weeks total and the middle metal support beams broke. ( no I do not just plop down on my bed or jump, I lay in one spot and that\u2019s it).Says it can hold up to 880 lbs or more I\u2019m guessing but I\u2019m about 300 and it failed. I did get ahold of the manufacturer and they said they sent the parts out again and haven\u2019t received anything to replace the beams. So I bought a whole new frame that I just rigged to connect to the headboard.Three stars because the headboard is the cool part and is really handy and I\u2019m glad it is now rigged to a new frame.Would have only gave one star of the headboard wasn\u2019t so neat. Very disappointed in the money I spent on this as a gift to myself and it broke after two weeks of just sleeping in it",
