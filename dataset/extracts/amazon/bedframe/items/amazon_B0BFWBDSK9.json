More so did it for the storage space but honestly I don't think I could ever go back to the way things were. I've had a complete shift in mood since getting a bedframe and I sleep a lot better!The bed frame itself is nice. Assembled very easily and makes absolutely no noise or creaking ( something i was concerned about when making the purchase ) I got the extended frame and keep a rolled up weighted blanket at the end for chilly nights. If you got the space I'd definitely recommend getting the bigger one simply do to the extra storage space.",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved into an \"independent living\" place (yes, I'm old) and took the opportunity to get rid of an old, heavy, wooden bed frame as well as the old box springs I had been using for many years -- and which put the mattress so high off the floor, my arthritis was now requiring me to use a stool to climb into bed. So I took only the newer pillow-top mattress with me when I moved.I had the packaged platform frame shipped to the new address and it arrived in perfect condition, with all the expected parts, and with the two small tools required to assemble it. Took me all of ten minutes to unbox it and bolt it together (and I'm not at all a handy person).The platform fits the mattress exactly, it feels exactly the same to my body as the box springs, it doesn't shift or squeak at all when I turn over (every half-hour) at night, it's not at all heavy, and it's easy to move and to dust under. The price seems quite fair, what I wold expect to pay for a decent product -- and I did see a number of other brands that appeared identical, both at Amazon and elsewhere, that were priced rather higher.I would recommend this item for anyone from college students to fogies like me, and my son is so impressed by it, he's planning to replace an old metal box-spring frame in his guest room with one.",

I\u2019d recommend putting something under the legs so it won\u2019t scratch floors if it moves. We put the anti skid on the bottom and it\u2019s on laminate floors so it stays put well.
