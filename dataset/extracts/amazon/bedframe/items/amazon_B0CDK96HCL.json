                "reviewText": "I was shocked at the quality of the bed frame for the price. You can tell quality materials are used. It\u2019s real wood, heavy, sturdy, and feels like it will last. It was a bit difficult and time consuming to put together, but nothing worse than some IKEA furniture I have put together, not that IKEA is a very high bar! I would highly recommend having someone help you put this together but it can be done with one person, just set aside a few hours, because it will take a bit. Instructions were pretty clear for the most part. I\u2019m satisfied with the purchase and my son loves it!",

This sturdy metal frame will be soooo much better for him. After assembly, My daughter, (who has a queen) and husband (California King) both want a bed like this. And I must admit, I'm a bit jealous of my sons new bed myself. Lol. We may be making additional purchases very soon!",

Two small flaws: one screw fitting was off due to a welded washer being off a bit, and the outlet should either be screwed on prior to constructing the headboard or a very short screwdriver is needed. Overall I love the look, the lighting is great, the storage area is handy, and the headboard is nice for leaning on. I am glad I chose this one!",

The joint (what makes the headboard opens) would have to be put on the side of the headboard first so that it's easier to add the last piece. No screws lost, extra screws is there if needed.
