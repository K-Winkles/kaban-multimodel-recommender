My son received this over the summer and was able to put it together on his own. My daughter loved the space underneath, so we got her one as well and she also put it together on her own. (Both are teens) The only complaint was that the included tool was small and hard to use at times, but they managed. One of our frames is with the box springs, one is without. With the box spring, it is too tall for me (I'm 5'4), but it works for my teen that is 5'10.",

Easy to store if needed (as in my case in a few years)Pro: Does not slide! The bed doesn\u2019t slide on the tile floor. Mattress stays put, which I honestly didn\u2019t expect.Pro: Easy to assemble. I did it by myself. Nicely high bed.Con: Although all parts were well wrapped. There were a few small paint chips off (see picture). This is not visible once you use it.I definitely would buy it again. Excellent price-quality! Makes no sounds and is not wobbly.Exactly as promised.",

Description stated non-slip, which is NOT the case. This description should be updated accordingly for this item. Had to order non-slip gaskets separately for $26 to make the frame non-slip (holding the mattress in place). Without these six gaskets ordered separately, the mattress slips when you get on and off the bed.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a new bed & warranty needed a new frame so I got this one. I bought it bcz it was high, I'm 6'1 & like to feel small, LOL. ITS super high! Love it! My feet barely touch the ground, gotta stretch! Essy to put together! I also got it for the durability, since I'm on the heavier side 300lbs+. It rarely makes noise/squeaks. I did put plywood under my new mattress bcz of warranty for my bed. I also did it bcz my bed was getting lopsided, so I'd recommend putting something under your mattress for even wear or a box spring, but again, it's tall, I think 18\". Also, if u have smaller animals, its pretty high for them to jump down, so id take that into consideration. I'm happy with this purchase!",

Not sound or movement. It is so sturdy but also movable as one person. (Don\u2019t do that\u2026 But you could) the hight is great for under bed storage and ventilation. Our dogs and kid play hide and seek underneath it.Be aware!! If you have older or shorter dogs who like to sleep in bed with you. Don\u2019t get this height! My smaller dog is sad she can\u2019t get up in bed with us anymore. To be fair it was rare she wanted to before. But now she is moody about it. So we bought her a new bed too. But the point is it is so tall!! And!! Being as tall as it is it great on my back! I suffer chronic hip and back pain and this makes waking up so much easier, by getting down out of bed and not trying to pull myself up.",

You can tell it's sturdy when you start to put the slates in. Most of my previous beds have had pretty sad indents for the slates but you can tell these will not fall out. Works well with our foam mattress and absolutely NO squeaking. It's amazing, we didn't even use a drill. It holds me (100 lbs) and my 6'2 bf (220 lbs) and our dog with no problems. I even jumped on the bed to be sure and absolutely no squeaking. Definitely a good choice. Also love how high up it is. I haven't attached a headboard because I really don't like those much but it looks like it would be pretty easy to do so.",
