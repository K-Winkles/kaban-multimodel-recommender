                "reviewText": "The rustic maple is even prettier in person! The frame itself is very sturdy and was quite easy to put together (2 helps but I honestly think I could've done it by myself). My only complaints are a lack of any type of barrier at the head to stop the mattress from sliding back, and that I wish the middle legs were a little further under the bed because they are right at the edge and are lethal to toes. Overall though I'm quite happy with this bed and impressed with the quality for the price.",

The bed is VERY sturdy and a much better quality than I assumed I would receive for the price. Much better than you get from some of the box stores. It is really pretty in person and I absolutely would purchase another if/when we need another.",

All the dimensions and measurements are exact. The back frame holds a lot of stuff so if you are like me, and want to put your phone, lotions, tissues, etc it is perfect. Even if you shake the bed your items will not fall off.No need for drawers there is more then enough room under the bed for containers to slide under. I have 4 on each side of the bed that stores a good portion of my things. Highly recommend this bed.",

                "reviewText": "First off the colors. Its exactly what I was looking for in a bed! It really tied the room together. It was fairly easy to assemble, just make sure you follow directions.Everything is well marked.Relatively affordable for an adult bedframe.It's only five inches across on the \"shelves\"And only 5 inches between the two shelves.I would double check everything before you buy (see below)To whom it may concern, if your wrote about the bed not lining up you probably tighten down the bolts prematurely. You should hand screw everything into place (long screws maybe a bit more).Once you walk through all the instructions go back and retighen everything.I would say after you complete the headboard you can tighten that down pretty well (if your sticking it in a corner and it's hard to move).Also pay special attention to the bolts that go from the frame to the headboard.Overall pretty quiet but any noise came from that area. Retighen them again and good as new.If the middle support bar doesn't reach the ground (like mine) you can add a sliver of wood( can't think of the name right now)But super easy,super cheap. At all major stores even Walmart.The sticky corner pads will absolutely not stay after the blanket knocks them off once.Bring your own tape or get creative with some pool noodles (if u don't care how it looks) \ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18.As far ash shipping.. not great.Didn't get the item at first had to ask neighbors Ect.Did end up with someone elses from another company.I ordered another one since I was convinced the first one wouldn't be coming home to me and my mattress was taking Alot of room as it aired out to it's final form(24-48 hours)!!Now going through the process of trying to return the second frame that isn't due for 2-5 day. Fingers crossed they can stop it so I get a full refund.If not they offered to let me sell it or give it away and give me 50$ back.... We'll see how it goes but so far the customer service has been amazing and on top of it.After some issues with shipping (from the company they use, not likimio) I finally received and assembled this bad boy. It's a bit smaller the I expected as far as the \"shelves\" and the over all height. Double check your measurements",
