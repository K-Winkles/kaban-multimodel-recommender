I like that the foot board doesn't stick up so he can still sit comfortably on the edge of the foot of the bed. I also like that the foot board goes all the way to the floor so you can't see under the bed from the door when you walk through the hallway. It is a lovely color and has a masculine feel for a boys bedroom. It has been easy to find mathing furniture on Amazon as well. It was easy to put together, probably took 30 minutes all together. Directions were clear and easy to follow. Packaging was compact. Shipping was faster than expected. Overall happy with the purchase and will recommend to others.",

Would definitely recommend to someone looking to add a little bit of an aesthetic to their room without a hefty price tag! I bought the queen size and my mattress fits on it perfectly! I like the lip at the foot of the frame, which sticks up just enough to keep the mattress from sliding. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase!",
