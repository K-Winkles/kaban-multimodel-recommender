It\u2019s very sturdy and not bulky at all!I got the \u201cFull\u201d size frame and it is stable, there\u2019s no wiggling or a fuss getting on and off. Since it is metal there\u2019s not much noise that comes with getting on and off, haven\u2019t had to deal with it scratching against the floor.Again, i got the \u201cFull\u201d size and it was a perfect fit for my mattress. (I also purchased one for my brother and he\u2019s very happy with it!)The instructions given are easy to follow and the entire assembly was very seamless and easy, can be done with just one person!I\u2019m overall extremely happy with this and for the pricing, i really have no complaints!",

Once you open the package the screws tend to mix and as they are close in size it took me a while to find their place. All done in about 45 minutes to an hour. I have issue with the transversal metallic slats, not all fit well to give the security of not falling off. With this frame I have three slates that I couldn\u2019t find a place to fit tight as they should. This meant that the frame is well put together and the distance between sides is even everywhere. The three slats\u2019s size is off. Over night, I heard one of them falling down. Today I heard the second one dropping on the floor. I\u2019ll have to come up with new ones or extend by an inch the ones I have. Otherwise it\u2019s a sturdy frame that I hope will last a long time.I kept the mattress box and now my bed is really high, the frame is 16\u201d alone. But it\u2019s fun, when I get off the bed as on a slide with a Wee! Hahaa. It\u2019s fun, a few inches of sliding.",
