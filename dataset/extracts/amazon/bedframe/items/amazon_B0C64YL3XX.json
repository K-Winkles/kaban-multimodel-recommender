First, I really like that the slats that support the mattress are metal and have secure spots they fit into. Past beds of mine have had cheap wood pieces that just lay there loosely and always end up breaking. The assembly was very easy. Took my partner and I less than an hour. The only negative thing I have to say is that the drawers just set on the floor and slide out but I don\u2019t see that being a problem, I consider that a bonus. I did know that before buying and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d care and I don\u2019t.",

They look fine at the end of the bed but look silly if you put them on the side instead. I get they are supposed to be at the end of the bed but that\u2019s not how it worked out with the bedroom layout. And we always tend to kick them and you can\u2019t really store much in them anyway.

I just could not get myself to order a frame that was that expensive. I went to look on amazon for a frame and I found this one. It was so easy to put together. It is super comfortable. I love the storage that it has at the foot of the bed. The shelf at the head of the bed is super convenient, especially the outlet up there! Couldn't be happier with my purchase for my new home!",

                "reviewText": "Love the look of the frame and it was super quick to put together. You\u2019ll definitely need 2 people to assemble since some of the parts are heavy. The frame states it holds 1000 pounds and so far there\u2019s been no issues there. but my complaint is how my mattress fits on the frame. We have a king size mattress and the mattress doesn\u2019t fit the whole frame. If we pull the mattress so there\u2019s no gap at the end of the bed, there\u2019s a gap by our heads and our pillows fall in the hole.The outlet at the top of the bed is super convenient and the drawers under the bed make nice storage.",
