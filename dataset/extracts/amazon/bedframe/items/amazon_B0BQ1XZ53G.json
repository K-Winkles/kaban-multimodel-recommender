The only thing that I don't like is that is seems a little shorter than I thought from the images. The entire bed ends up being very close to the ground with the mattress on it, but not a deal breaker.",

                "reviewText": "I did like the bedframe itself, it's sturdy and while it takes a while to build, it's not overly complicated. the issue I have is that even though I bought what was listed as a brand new product on amazon, there were slight signs of wear and tear on the parts. I didn't take much note of it until I saw in the padding on the central beam, there were indents left from a previous time this had been built and had a mattress on top to create those indents, as you can see in the pictures above. Not a huge deal to me personally, but I can't tell if it was an accident on their part or just a scummy move. I'd other wise recommend this product, but watch keep this in mind.",

I never want to spend so much money on something that I'll feel guilty or wasteful if I change my mind in a couple years. I have found many good quality inexpensive items this way that have lasted me longer than I thought I'd even keep the item. This is actually my 2nd bedframe by Zinus. Highly recommend giving them a chance. Reading reviews are helpful!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the Zinus bed frame. It arrived within a week. Tried putting it together and it is missing one crucial piece (forgive the image background we are redoing the bedroom). The issue is that I received two versions of one piece, rather than it's paired mate.I immediately followed the information on the directions to contact Zinus support. I used email to contact them and the virtual assistant responded telling me what info to send them to receive support (which I had already provided, but fine). I followed all of their instructions and heard nothing. I called the 800 number and the virtual assistant said that because I had purchased through Amazon, Zinus could not help me and that I needed to reach out to Amazon and then their virtual assistant hung up on me. Amazon says I must contact Zinus to receive support. So you see, there is no way to get help if you have a missing piece.I am debating if I want to take the bed apart and return it., but that's a major hassle. I really would just like the missing piece because otherwise the bed seems nice. In fact, it's fairly easy to put together when they give you all the correct pieces!Really, it shouldn't be this hard to just get to one piece I need to make this bed frame functional. I have spent hours trying to get this resolved, but to no avail.edit: I returned the bed and was refunded. I shipped it following amazons instructions and UPS came and picked it up in July and was refunded a week later. It is now the end of August and I was recharged for this bed frame because it was not received at the factory. However, UPS has the record of picking it up. I cannot control what happens after I ship it back. I had to go back through various customer service communications to try to get my money back again. JUST DONT DO IT. THIS BED IS NOT WORTH IT.",
