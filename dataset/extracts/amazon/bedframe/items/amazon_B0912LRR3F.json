So be prepared to be patient, even though the directions were clear. Would probably be faster/easier with two people.Also, I wish the headboard spindles were higher, because they\u2019re barely visible even with a single layer of pillows. Any decorative pillows hide them completely. And where the center support meets the floor on the side of the bed is a huge toe-stubbing hazard, so expect a bit of a learning curve to avoid owies.But for the price, can\u2019t really complain. It looks good and I\u2019m sure will serve me well for years.",
