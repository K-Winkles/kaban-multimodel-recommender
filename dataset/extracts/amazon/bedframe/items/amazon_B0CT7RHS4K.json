It's sturdy and I like it a lot, but my memory foam mattress is a little too low and there's a small gap. Easy fix is a box spring so I'll be getting one of those and it will be perfect! I like the charging option because I have limited wall outlets on this side of the room, and the small shelf is really handy too. It looks great, but I do have to watch my kittens around it because they think it makes an excellent scratching post and the fabric snags very easily.",

I would put the charger on the side to prevent this. The headboard is soft and has a little shelf up top. Assembly was fine, though the instructions were not crystal clear. I\u2019m 275lbs and the thing doesn\u2019t squeak or creak unless there\u2019s significant bouncing or motion on the frame.",

I put this together by myself and got it down roughly in an hour or so..the only bad thing is it was heavy carrying it up the stairs and I had a difficult time putting that back piece on (what is pictured) but it was relatively easy to put together. another thing I\u2019d like to mention is that it\u2019s kinda lower to the ground but other than that this bed frame is 10/10. would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I have never purchased furniture on line before, but am so happy I did in this case. The bed arrived nicely packaged, and I watched in amazement as the UPS lady man-handled it up to my door. The box was so heavy that it took the strength of my husband and me to get it to the bedroom. We managed to assemble it together in about two hours or less, and all the parts were there and fit together nicely. Our queen mattress fits perfectly on it. We use it as a guest bed, and I've only slept on it a couple of times, but it felt solid and didn't make any noises when I moved. My husband is a mechanical engineer and he usually has criticisms of products like this, but he had none here! I especially love the USB port in the headboard, which is why I picked this one. It saves our guests from having to find the outlet behind the nightstand to plug in their phone. It comes with a cord that easily reached from behind the bed to behind the nightstand where the outlet is, so all you have to do is plug your phone into the USB port and safely place your phone on the headboard ledge for the night. I ordered the off-white color, and it is true to what was shown; it has a yellow tone rather than a blue or grey tone. It makes a great improvement to our guest room, having replaced a sleigh bed, which took up too much room. This sleek design doesn't waste any space. I highly recommend this purchase.",
