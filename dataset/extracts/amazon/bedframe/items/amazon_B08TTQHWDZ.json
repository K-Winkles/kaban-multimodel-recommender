There isn't anything advising a \"preferred\" method of install or anything, the vertical attachment side has one longer segment, one shorter segment. It messes you up if they aren't in the same direction. Once I got that straight it attached well enough to my headboard (that I'm still annoyed didn't come with these brackets but that's not the bracket company's fault). Headboard went on, I wish it could be nudged up higher but it's already a bit wobbly. It's going against a wall so no big deal anyway. I'm happy overall, I don't anticipate issues. The screws provided worked perfectly.",
