Everything came in a nice package and no damage or scratches to any of the metal framing. Just need to get a head board and foot board to complete. Holes are already drilled into framing to make mounting them easy. After assembly, the framing was very nice and sturdy. Was no squeaking either but it was only day one. We will see if it does in the future. Simple and Easy for the price.",

In exchange for the painless setup of this product, you have a bed frame that holds a box spring, mattress, and two adults with ZERO noise, play, etc.5 stars guys!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this platform to fit inside an existing bed frame where the wood slats had broken. The bed is 12 years old and is part of a very nice wedding gift set. I wanted something to last another 15-20 years, but without more wooden slats that will eventually wear out again. I also wanted to replace the original mattress box springs.I wasn't even sure this platform frame would work, as it's designed to be a stand-alone piece of furniture. But unlike other similar frames where the sizing is approximate, the dimensions are exactly as indicated in the product description and this platform frame fit perfectly.The platform frame itself is good quality and easy to assemble. Just pay attention. I put one of the rails on backwards and to take it back apart. That was a real PITA right after twisting the bolts extra tight so it won't loosen up.I highly recommend that you toss out the little metal wrench included with the hardware package. It's thin and doesn't work very well. If you want a really secure fit use a 15mm socket wrench. It will take you literally seconds to tighten each bolt vs. the frustration of trying to use the wrench.The \"non-skid\" rails aren't particularly impressive. I didn't trust them to not scratch my wood floor and stuck rubber non-skid grommets on the bottom of each. The frame still moves slightly but won't scratch up the floor.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it.",
