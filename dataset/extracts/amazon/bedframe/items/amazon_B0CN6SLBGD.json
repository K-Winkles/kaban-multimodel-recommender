I slept so well! Getting off the box spring/wheeled frame makes such a difference. The bed is solid and very sturdy and is also silent. The bed I had before was super tall but this is low profile, easy to get in/out of and was easy to put together. This is a wonderful bed at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Novilla bedframe, and it's been a fantastic addition to my bedroom. The frame is made from high-quality steel, ensuring durability and stability. I was particularly impressed by the sleek, modern design that easily blended with my contemporary decor. The assembly process was straightforward, with clear instructions and all tools included. It took me under an hour to set it up. The frame provides excellent support for my memory foam mattress, and there's no creaking or movement, even when I toss and turn. The under-bed clearance is a bonus, offering ample storage space. Despite its sturdiness, it's surprisingly lightweight and easy to move when needed.For the price, I believe the Novilla offers great value, especially considering its durability and design. My only minor gripe is that I wish it came in more color options. Overall, it's a solid, attractive, and functional bed frame that I'd highly recommend to anyone in the market for a reliable and stylish option.",

I like the matte black finish and it\u2019s light weight enough to move around easily by myself. I gave this a 4 star rating because there were no instructions in the box for me to make sure I had all parts. I spent over an hour looking at the images posted for the product and with a little process of elimination I figured out which screws went to which parts. All the parts were there so I was able to put the bed together in about 30 minutes. I\u2019m very satisfied with this purchase!",

The original one I purchased was for a canopy bed and I was a little crushed when it wouldn't fit in my apartment - so I rush ordered this one as it fit the aesthetic I was going for and was decently priced. I honestly like it a lot and it was pretty easy to go together minus some assembler error (I put one of the legs upside down at first LOL) Once I got it figured out, it went together easily in about 30 minutes and fit my bed beautifully. It fit into the space wonderfully and I'm happy with it.",
