Sometimes I jump to sit on the bed and it doesn\u2019t shift at all and it doesn\u2019t make any sound either. Assembling it is pretty straight forward, I would highly recommend getting someone to help you. I assembled this by myself and my goodness, it was a little difficult at times. And there were some bolts that would just not screw in and I had to use a lot of force. The ratchet that comes with it is a nice tool! If you\u2019re looking for a bed frame that\u2019s on the less expensive side, I would recommend this one. Whenever you move it will also break down very compactly.",

Only problem is the box springs slide a little, easy adjustment back. There are adhesive tapes on the frame, but we didn\u2019t peel them because we are planning on buying new mattresses from the local Amish mattress shop. Hopefully the adhesive tape will work on them. Otherwise no problem.No head board means pillows fall off, but not a big deal. Extra room under the bed a plus. Can see dust quicker lol, sweeper doesn\u2019t fit perfectly, still need to use attachments.",

Only downsides were the instructions became miss-labeled half way through (but it's simple so there wasn't any problems for me) and the double sided sticky tape really only works once. I got a bed skirt later and when i lifted the mattress, the tape came with and got tangled together making it useless. Would recommend to put down a skirt or box spring first; if you don't have or won't use just leave the paper on the tape since it'll just come off anyways when changing your sheets.",

I was worried no box spring would mean the bed would be quite low, but this is higher than my old frame+box spring+mattress. Really enjoy the height of this frame. It's been nice and sturdy, no squeaking sounds, the frame isn't moving around from getting in/out. Surprised on the quality for this price, the easy assembly. I really enjoyed the allen wrench/socket tool they included, which made assembling this an absolute pleasure (seriously, I really enjoyed ratcheting that thing).",
