This frame is PERFECT for visitors! It sets up well in the \"spare\" room and then packs away perfectly to fit under a regular bed frame. It's sturdy and a good height when set up. We got a tri-fold mattress to go with it that goes in a protective bag and up in the attic when not being used. I've been very happy with this purchase and my parents were pleasantly surprised and happy with their first use with it too.",

The bed frame makes a bit of noise - but that could be because of the hardware issue I encountered. There is tons of space underneath the bed frame for storage which I will be using. The shipping price for this item is ridiculous, but in the end it\u2019s worth it. Overall, a good quality product for a good price.",
