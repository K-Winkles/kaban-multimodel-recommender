                "reviewText": "I decided to upgrade my king mattress for a new one. My daughter wanted the old one because she wanted to move up to a bigger bed. She didn't know I was going to totally redo her room. She thought I was going to put her mattress on a simple metal frame and then we'd get a head board later on. Needless to say she was totally surprised when she walked into her bedroom and saw this beautiful upholstered bed with all it's bells and whistles, including LED lighting, usb ports and power outlets. She loves the programable app that she downloaded to her phone that controls the various modes of the LED's. Space is at a premium since we moved up from a twin to a king, so the underbed storage is a plus. Her mattress is a Tempur-pedic which is very heavy, so she can't access the storage easily without my help. That info may be useful to prospective buyers who can't handle heavy lifting. It should be easier with lighter mattress brands/types. Assembly instructions were clear and concise. There are a lot of parts and pieces so bring a lunch. A power screwdriver or drill with a hex bit is a must or you'll be at it for a loooong time. All in all, it is an excellent product at a great price. As I said in the title, my daughter absolutely loves it!",

                "reviewText": "Honestly better then I expected. I've never purchased a big piece of furniture like this online and it exceeded my expectations for the price.The Good:Sturdy.The hydraulics actually work and keep my king size matrass up very well. Feels really solid once its up.Having outlets up top and a little shelf are fantastic.Looks great.The Meh:I would have liked to have the storage underneath fully enclosed, like with an actual bottom instead of sitting directly on the carpet, but its still decent.Would have rather had two, or really more, usb-c ports instead of 1 x usb-c and 1 x usb-a.The Bad:It does take more effort then I expected to pull the matrass up before the hydraulics really kick in and help. Not a problem for me personally but I would not recommend this for younger kids or the elderly.There is also not as much storage space as I was expecting, it's not horrible but its not much more then I already had with my normal old bed frame. Though it is much easier to utilize the space now.There was some pieces missing the little sticker telling you which piece was which but it was easy enough to figure out with the images in the instructions.And lastly, it's a bit of a beast to put together, it took me about 4 hours to get everything together by my self and the headboard was a little bit of a pain to do solo.I recommend not tightening most of the screws until you get most of it together, I had to loosen some sections on the backboard and side panels to get everything to fit nicely.",

                "reviewText": "The bed is very sturdy and this is the reason why it takes a good two hours to put it together.Pros: the bed is exactly what I expected from the online pictures. The bed has strip light and outlet to charge your phone. This is great and reduced the cluster next to the bed. The strip light comes with a remote control. It could be timed and the brightness is adjustable. It also has several colors and can change color fast and slow as how I set it. The biggest thing for me is how sturdy a bed is, and it is sturdy. The base is all metal and the wood slats has plastic cover on both end that securely snapped into the metal so they don\u2019t slide up and down. The bed has two hydraulic that assists with lifting up the mattress and store things under the bed. The bed height is not too much. When I put my 12 inches mattress on top they look perfect together.Cons: Like all bed from Amazon, you will need to assemble it. The instruction is clear and easy to read, however due to the bed having a lot of moving parts, it takes longer than assembling any other bed I had before. So, it was not as simple as putting four legs into a frame. It took two adults around 2 hrs to get it done, so if you need to plan for a new bed before a certain time, make sure you plan accordingly and get a helper.Overall, after a few weeks sleeping on this bed. It did not creek, it did not give me the feeling of sleeping on a bed from Amazon. It feels solid and people have no idea I bought it from Amazon at all. Even the assembling part took awhile, I would still buy it again base on the quality of this product.",
