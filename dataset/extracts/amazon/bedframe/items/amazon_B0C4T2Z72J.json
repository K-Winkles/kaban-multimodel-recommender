It is a bit difficult to put together, it's definitely easier with 2 people, at least for getting the 2 ends together because you have to hold several pieces in perfect alignment while you screw them together. Still, managed to do almost all of it on my own, but some pieces were crooked so I asked for help just with holding them while I screwed them together to straighten it up. It's very quiet, no squeaks whatsoever! Definitely a high quality bed frame and well made. Highly recommend if you're looking for a space saving design and you like to keep it simple!",

                "reviewText": "I'm staying in the guest bedroom at my moms while custom renovating my camper to move in and travel full time. This was the perfect solution for me to tuck some of my items away without encroaching on their garage or other spaces. Now I can keep things nice and tidy. I was kinda shocked initially how high up this made the bed especially with a pillowtop mattress. It was super easy to assemble, very lightweight and now I can slide full size storage totes under it no problem! Great thing for dorm rooms too! Very cool I'll post a picture of it once I install the headboard onto frame properly.One observation so far is the the corners are almost perfectly knee high and for safety reasons I really think they need to include something to protect people from banging their knees on them. Rounded padding maybe? As a fabricator by trade for a few years and handy woman I'll be figuring out a way to create my own devices to install on them and will return with my solution just in case the company or others are interested in what I come up with.",

                "reviewText": "Can a bed frame change your life?! Yes, yes it can. When you had negative storage space and suddenly have an entire extra large closet\u2019s worth of storage space, it\u2019s pretty drastic.I started with one, and have since assembled one of these frames for each family member and this was the last one. Assembly was simple as expected, but I remember they even my first assembly, (which was a king size!) wasn\u2019t difficult, it just took a little longer. The frames are so sturdy not even the first one is wobbly after many years. No boxspring needed unless you want to use a step-stool to climb into bed, or get a running start across the room.Super sturdy. I can\u2019t imagine ever going back to our old bed frames with 4-6 inches of space underneath.You can slide several large storage drawers underneath with room to spare on top.I could rave about these for awhile.Suffice to say these bed frames are pretty great. Most definitely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to set up, instructions are clear, but make no mistake, this is still a \"cheap\" basic bed frame. Lower quality than the Ikea bed it replaced, and will definitely need padded feet so it doesn't destroy our real hardwood floors.Feels a little wobbly once the mattress is on it, but an \"expected level of wobble\" considering that its made out of thin'ish stamped metal. Mattress-to-frame fit is also acceptable but not perfect. The memory foam mattress we've got on it (also from Amazon) leaves a couple inches of space where the frame is bigger than the mattress on all sides.",
