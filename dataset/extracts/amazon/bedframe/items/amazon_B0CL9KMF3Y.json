And definitely only need a mattress top and not a box spring because it makes it so high up with a box spring.",

The courier service was with Canada Post who didn't deliver the bed at first and I was expected to pick up the heavy package. Amazon customer service was not at all helpful.

I ordered the bed on Sunday 14th Jan '24 and the estimated delivery date was a month away which I was willing to wait.To my surprise, the next day I see that the bed had been dispatched and on Tuesday 16th as I came back from work I see the bed in front of my door so I was EXTREMELY impressed by how swift and simple the process was.I assembled the bed by myself in less than hour. Clear instructions, nothing was missing, everything was clear and very very simple and easy to follow. That night I had the best sleep I've had in ages, new bed felt like heaven and it's so aesthetically pleasing too. It's sturdy, doesn't slide or move, and can support a lot of weight as my mattress is quite thick and heavy.All in all this is the best investment I've made thus far this year and I would STRONGLY recommend and encourage you to purchase this without hesitation. It is a worthwhile investment.God bless you :)",
