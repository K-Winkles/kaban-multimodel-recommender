No marks on the floor either after sliding.Built like a tank..and doesn't make any noise. I was going to lay down a layer of plywood in between the memory foam mattress and the frame but that was a mistake--the plywood slides around! The frame is built for memory foam mattresses. No sharp corners to stub toes on. 4 plastic mattress guides snapped snugly onto the frame to keep the mattress firmly aligned on the frame. Not that it would slide much anyway.Assembly was a bit grinding. Difficult to get everything out of the box without a helper. Very well packed with dozens of foam pad inserts to make sure nothing is scratched during shipping. Once out, everything sorted out nicely according to lettered labeling. Directions are fairly simple.. to the point where everything is shown by simple diagrams with 4 or 5 steps. An allen wrench and a small steel wrench are provided. You may need a rubber/ wood mallet or 2xx4 block with a regular hammer to tap things into place at one step, so allen bolts can thread. It was tedious turning at least 14 allen screws with the provided allen L wrench, but no big deal.All and all though, rock solid product. Whoeever made and designed this thing was definitely on the ball! If you're looking for a good solid mattress frame without a box spring, that is rock solid and quiet, this thing is what you need!",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t usually write reviews, but I was so hesitant to buy this online and then was so impressed that I wanted to write one. We got my daughter a new mattress that did not need a box spring. This was the first time purchasing a frame like this without the need for a box spring. I was nervous it would be cheaply made, noisy and uncomfortable. I\u2019m happy to say I was wrong! The packaging was great and it was easy to put together. The frame is sturdy and quiet and I love the extra space it gives you underneath. If you are looking fine this type of frame but unsure, this is a great one to go with.",

I was very surprised and happy to see that not only is this frame sturdy, but it makes absolutely no sounds! I am not a smaller person so was skeptical about the advertised weight limits, but I am so glad i made this purchase. It does not shift, squeak, or have any give in the slats. Thank you for making an awesome product! The only addition I have is a piece of plywood between the mattress and the frame to prevent mattress sagging.",
