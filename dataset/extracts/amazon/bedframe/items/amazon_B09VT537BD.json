Two of the bars bent immediately with one falling out of its supports. I would assume this would also be no good for a younger child who is inclined to jump on their bed.Less important but still annoying is there is no way for the drawers to stay under the bed without moving if they\u2019re bumped (we have vinyl laminate flooring)The good: assembly was easy enough, frame is lightweight, there were extra of each bolt included in case you lose one while assembling.It\u2019s a nice looking frame and was shipped packaged appropriately to not have damage when it arrived.We will try putting plywood under the mattress to see if it takes the strain off the individual support bars so we don\u2019t have to return it.",

At this point, we are going to buy a new bed.Original review: This bed looks exactly like the picture. Overall, I love the appearance. Now that it\u2019s been several months owning it, we\u2019ve learned that no one except our 5 year old can sit or lay on it otherwise the \u201csupport\u201d bars underneath the mattress will bend. With even the slightest bit of pressure, these bend completely in half so we\u2019ve resorted to flipping the bent ones over so at least the mattress doesn\u2019t fall through and setting a house rule that no one over 65lbs can even look at the bed for fear the bars will bend. I would definitely not buy this again unless it came with triple the amount of support bars (we\u2019ve already been through 5).",
