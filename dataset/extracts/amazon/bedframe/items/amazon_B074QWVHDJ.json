                "reviewText": "This bed was so easy to put together by myself, I probably had it done within 30 minutes. It seems to be good quality and sturdy too. I recently bought a queen split box spring for my old bed and didn\u2019t want to get rid of them so quickly so decided to try them on the bed frame and they fit great with the mattress on top. It\u2019s pretty tall, but I don\u2019t mind; the amount of space to store things underneath makes up for the height. I\u2019m able to stack two under-bed bins, whereas my old bed could barely fit one underneath. I kept my old headboard which just leans against the wall behind it. Overall pretty happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.",

                "reviewText": "Earlier this year, I bought a whole new bedroom furniture set. The bed, though very nice otherwise, was not designed properly for fully supporting a box spring. This resulted in the 4 month-old box spring breaking. Now I could have replaced it under warranty through the mattress retailer, but this would just happen again. So I spent hours researching all these different platform frames and ultimately decided on the Zinus Abel. I needed a platform that would fit inside the wood bed frame. I was nervous about ordering it because I wasn't sure if I could trust the advertised dimensions. The dimensions are, however, exactly as advertised.Putting this frame together was really easy. It took me about 45 minutes, but only because I had a small amount of room to work with and had to assemble it inside my wood bed frame (so that I wouldn't have to take it apart) according to a per-rehearsed plan. (That and I accidentally grabbed the wrong legs for the center cross bar, so they didn't touch the floor and I had to switch them out for the correct ones. Oops.) If I were setting it up in the open, or prior to setting up the wood bed frame, it would have gone much faster.The platform is nice and solid, more so than I expected. I was also pleased to see that there is some padding on the center rail to keep the slats from making any noise against it.When I was researching this frame, I of course paid attention to the negative reviews. There is a common theme among them in that most of the people experiencing problems with the legs either have hardwood floors or the platform is standing alone. All beds will move when you use them, even without any \"fun stuff.\" I don't expect that mine will move, as I placed some acoustic foam as shims around each corner of the platform to keep the platform from shifting inside my bed frame. Perhaps others may find it beneficial to secure the platform to minimize the shifting that can cause damage to the legs. The other problem I've seen people have is over-torquing the bolts. It's best to tighten them down until they stop, and then use just a little more pressure to torque them down until they stop again. Never tighten them so much that the rails start to cave in around the bolt heads. Also, take a little clear nail polish and dab it on the ends of the bolt threads...just a dab at the end...and they won't loosen over time but can still be removed normally.",

The packaging is very well made, easy to open and every is well secured. The protecting styrofoam isn't the cheap kind that flakes and gets everywhere.The instructions are very easy to follow. Every parts is numbered so you just have to assemble them in an order. I only needed the instructions to know which length of screw to use and since there is only two sizes, it's very easy to follow. There is some spare screws, no bolts requried. There is your standard hex key plus they included a very nice and powerful hex ratchet. It works very well and I've never seen any company including this kind of tool. It's a must!Even though the instructions recommend two persons to assemble, it's very easy to do it alone. I did it alone in 26 minutes. I didn't have to force anything, everything went smoothly together. No parts warped and the final product is a straight and sturdy frame. They even included 4 lattes with double tape, just have to peel it off and the mattress will never slip off.I would buy again and again in a heart beat. I would recommend anyone to buy it. It looks good and it's the best quality/price I've ever seen for a product.",

Just do one bolt without tight it completely and go to the other corner putting the contrary bolt. Do the same with the other, once all put it, thigh all of them. That's the only detail to have in mind. The package comes with a great allen ratchet that makes the work way easier than with a standard allen wrench.Sturdiness is great. No issues after 2 weeks and even moving the bed is easy; not heavy and slides like if it has wheels.Great product. I never wrote a review before, but this one is worth it.",
