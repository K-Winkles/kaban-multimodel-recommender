                "reviewText": "Convinced my husband to get this so we wouldn\u2019t have to get rid of our nice queen mattress after upgrading to a king (already had a full mattress for our son).The bed feels pretty sturdy for kids to use with no concern, which is the most important factor to consider for bunk beds in my opinion. Husband assembled the bed on his own in about an hour so nothing too complicated, but an extra set of hands is needed every once in a while to hold certain pieces up for tightening (and probably to put the full bed on top!).My only complaint\u2026 there were safety warning stickers on a piece that was a PAIN in the bootyhole to try and remove. Unfortunately, we did not have any googone so I tried water/soap, acetone, vinegar, clorox wipes, all my sponges to no avail. In desperation (and frustration) my husband went and sanded it down LOL\u2026 which was dumb on our part because yes, it got rid of the ugly sticky parts but also stripped the paint off. Slightly upset about it and will probably need to paint over it to avoid rusting and stuff but oh well.Would be much better if the manufacturer used those easy to peel stickers instead, but since that is unlikely, make sure you have some googone available before assembling!",
