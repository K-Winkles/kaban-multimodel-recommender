                "reviewText": "I bought a smaller version of a all metal frame/foundation for myself years back and decided its time for my mother to get one too. I got this one so its higher up and is easier on her legs to get in and out of bed. Also her old frame was one of those fold up 2 piece frames with wheels, hers was bending and shifting the bed around.The frame was an absolute nightmare for us to put together, the instructions to not specify which way is IN or OUT or UP or DOWN it just shows \"Part A connects to B\" type of diagram. Ive had to take apart 2 pieces and swap them around because of this as it is built differently then mine which i ordered years prior.They give you a align wrench and a makeshift metal tube socket wrench with a pipe you insert into the center and use it to turn. Why do none of these products give you a hex-drill bit? I ended up ordering a 30 piece hex-bit set after this because it took us FOUR HOURS to put it together...The welds on the top and bottom covers for the legs only have 4 weld points in the center of each side. Making the welds break apart when your screwing in the bolts tightly. The threads do not have a point where the bolt reaches its fully tightened state so you can just keep twisting until it feels tight enough. 2 welds popped for me, but this isnt going to affect the use of it so its fine.The support beams/poles (8 of them, 4 on top 4 on bottom) do not screw in, they just set down into the anchor points. Even though the anchor points DO HAVE A HOLE for a screw or bolt, the instructions and poles do not have any screws, holes, or instructions to do so. So if you tried completing this frame and tilted it sideways to move all 8 of these poles would fall out.This frame cannot be bent, folded, or compactly stored in any way after assembly.The frame i bought is able to do all of this, the legs fold down, and the frame folds in half if we want to move it around.Seems to work good with foam mattresses. A 12 inch mattress was used with this.",

I like the height of the bed frame, you don't necessarily NEED a box spring to give it that support that you need, the supportive structure of the rod beams are very sturdy and strong. I would totally recommend this to my friends and family",
