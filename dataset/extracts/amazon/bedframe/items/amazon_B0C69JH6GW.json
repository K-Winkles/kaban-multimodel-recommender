This is for my 18 year old son, so I can\u2019t tell you how well it will hold up after months or years of use, but I feel like it will be good for a long time. The lights are a nice bonus. He really is enjoying this and it looks good in his room.

I did think the headboard would be a little bigger but I think my mattress and topper swallowed it up. Very easy set up.

                "reviewText": "I had the same queen-sized mattress and frame for the last 10 years. My original frame had wooden slats. I thought that my mattress was sinking inward. My wooden slats were also starting to bend. I was going to buy a new bed frame and then a mattress separately since they can be expensive to purchase together. So, I started by purchasing this frame. I liked the idea that it has a platform to store my phones and tablets as well as a built-in electrical unit to plug my devices into. I'm an older, lightweight female who is about 5 feet tall. I actually put the frame together by myself, even though the instructions state that one should have a partner help them. Putting it together by myself was no problem at all. The only problem I had an issue with was the placement of the LED lights around the bed. I originally was not going to install them, but I did so and didn't do a good job. (Maybe that is what the partner could be used for. (lol)). But since that's not the main reason for my purchase, it's fine. After I placed my old mattress on this frame, I realized that my mattress is firm and sturdy and not sinking in, even after all these years. Purchasing this wonderful frame just saved me the money I would have spent on purchasing it and a new mattress. I'm considering buying another set of frames for one of my kids now (he also has a frame with wooden slats). This was a great purchase and I would recommend it to others. 5/5 stars.",
