                "reviewText": "The frame was lightweight and assembly was easy. My husband and I put it up in probably about 30 minutes because we are extra careful when assembling furniture. When installing the legs, some of the bolts are REALLY tough to screw into, so you may need a second person to provide a counter force on the bolts for that part while the other person tightens the screws. However, once screwed tight, the frame feels super sturdy. You may find it easier to install the slats with a rubber mallet because it's a tight fit. Once assembled, nothing shifts around and it's been really quiet and provided great support to our box spring and mattress.Its height is excellent, as we can now fit standard sized Sterilite storage bins underneath. There's even enough clearance to place those bins on furniture dollies! This gives us a place to store the dollies when not in use and allows us to wheel the bins in and out from underneath with ease. Couldn't ask for a better price for all this too.",
