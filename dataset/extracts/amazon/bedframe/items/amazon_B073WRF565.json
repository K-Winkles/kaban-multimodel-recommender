                "reviewText": "Bought the 18\" high twin in June 2023 for $74.00.---It's better than we expected however there is some room for improvement.---Here's some info that doesn't seem to be posted anywhere. The outer frame ring is 1\"x.5\" tube steel, I don't know how thick but it feels pretty solid. There's 4 horizontal cross member tube steel bars (1\"x.4\" *ei: 13/32* ) on each half of the bed. The gaps between them range from 6\" inches at the head/foot to 8.5\" next to the center of the frame. There are 9 vertical mattress support rods that are 1/8\" diameter, they feel sturdy and look like they're welded on pretty well. The gaps between the rods about 4\" except at the sides where they're 2.5\". (most other makers have fewer vertical rods, like maybe 5 to 8 on a twin) So, the largest unsupported areas are about 4\"x8.5\" near the center of the bed. But that area has extra support from the center leg cross member. The angled extension supports at the head/foot are .5\"x.5\" square tubes and they lock the legs in place when the fame in unfolded.---The frame feels sturdy can probably support some pretty decent weight. Light weight folks can probably just toss 4\" medium to firm foam mattress and be good to go. Heavier folks (like 225-250+) might want to consider adding some kind of base under the mattress to rely more on the cross members and not so much on the 1/8\u201d rods.---As others have mentioned, some of the rod ends might tend snag on fabric. A simple solution is tape. Just tape over any areas that have any tiny points. It\u2019d be great if that wasn\u2019t even an issue, but it\u2019s easy to fix and no one will ever see the tape. I plan to use strapping tape because it'll likely hold up longer than other types.---The push button spring ball release makes setting up and taking down this frame incredibly quick. When folded the frame is really compact. And since the mattress can be dealt with separately, it's far more convenient to maneuver and store than a standard folding roll away bed. We also bought one of the mattresses that folds into thirds to go with it.---For the 18\u201d high models, the underneath storage space is great. It may be a bit tall for shorter folks to comfortably sit on the edge of the bed though since their feet won\u2019t touch the floor.--My only real disappointment with the frame is with most of the hinge areas. This is where two frame parts are connected but they\u2019re allowed move. Most of these hinge points are only supported by one point on the bolt (ie: only one side of a rectangular leg instead of both sides). Very few people are heavy enough to shear a bolt but it still feels like a cut corner to not have support on both sides of these moving points. I\u2019ve attached pics, one showing how this bed is put together and another showing how they could improve it by adding additional support.---All in all, we\u2019re very pleased. We bought primarily for portability. Moving kids in and out of unfurnished college housing twice a year for four years is tiresome. \u2018Everything\u2019 needs to be sturdy, yet light weight and collapsible to a manageable size/weight for transportation. I would be willing to buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I got two of these bed frames for my kids who share a room. It's essentially two twin bedframes joined together in one unit, but the joining is sturdy and reliable. I sometimes would lay with my kids to read them a story, etc and I'm not a light guy. Between a mattress, bedding, a kid, and me, we'd far exceed the listed weight limit for the bed and it's NEVER felt unsturdy after almost 2 years of use. Additionally, unlike a lot of metal bed frames, this one doesn't squeak at all. Not even a bit. There's enough room underneath to store tubs or whatever, although the leg set-up means you have to be a bit strategic on placement. But for the money, ease of use, and efficient fold up nature of these frames, you can't go wrong with this purchase if you need a simple, no frills mattress support.",

                "reviewText": "The Amazon Basics foldable metal bed frame has been a noteworthy addition to my bedroom setup. I ordered Queens size 14 inches. Right off the bat, the fact that it eliminates the need for a box spring is a significant advantage, simplifying the bed assembly process and saving costs. The mattress foundation is efficient and robust, thanks to the steel legs, cross beams, and vertical wires. However, there's one area where it could use some improvement. I've noticed that the bed tends to slip during use, which can be a bit of an inconvenience. Perhaps some added grip or friction at the base could rectify this minor issue.All in all, the Amazon Basics foldable metal bed frame offers excellent value for its price, with just a small room for enhancement. If you're looking for a reliable, quiet, and easy-to-assemble bed frame, this is a solid choice. Just be mindful of the slipping, and perhaps consider some non-slip pads or a rug underneath.",

It is extremely easy to setup, and fold back up. No tools required. Wow! Love the amount of storage space there is underneath it. The metal feels strong and sturdy. Matte finish. I got a twin sized one. At the moment I would totally recommend it.(I'll update my review after a year of use if I remember as I can't comment on longevity at this time.)",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the queen because that\u2019s what size I need and once it arrived I realized that if someone were looking for two twin frames this queen model would be one steal of a deal for them because it comes in two twin size sections which very easily bolt together with two very easy to use included pieces. A single twin frame like this runs about $140 and this queen cost me $188 taxes all in and it\u2019s totally up to you whether you bolt them together to make a queen frame or leave them unbolted and have two twins. It was super easy to assemble. I\u2019m 62 and disabled and had it set up in less than 10 minutes by myself. No box spring is needed however I suggest that when it arrives that you simply slide the two folded sections carefully out of the shipping box and as long as that cardboard box is in relatively good condition upon arrival you can carefully cut it open using a utility knife and it along with one cardboard insert are enough to lay over the bars and cables which will protect your mattress from squishing through the openings. This is assuming that you have a soft or foam mattress. If you have one of those rigid sided mattresses then having something underneath of it is a non-issue. It is sturdy and lightweight and super versatile should your bed size needs change down the road. In fact if you ever needed to go from a queen to just one single you could easily unbolt the two sections and store one of them under the other because both single sections conveniently fold for storage which by the way is another nice plus about this model. It has a generous amount of storage space underneath not to mention that the entire unit would be a breeze to store should that need ever arise for you. I\u2019m not easy to impress but the total versatility of this product to me is simplistic genius. Wish I would have owned this years ago instead of that heavy clunky hard to move piece of doodoo from ikea that I lugged around for years. Kudos to the manufacturer.",
