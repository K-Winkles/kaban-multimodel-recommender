                "reviewText": "I want to start by saying this frame is impressive. For the price, I was expecting low quality metal and parts not aligning. To my surprise, this bed arrived in perfect condition with all parts working together. I am really surprised there are not more reviews about this product. I have been recommending this to my family and friends because the product is phenomenal.With my experience, I wasn't missing any legs and the package was sealed. When I started the assembly, each piece matched perfectly to the next. When I inserted the slats across the frame, some were tight and others were loose. Then some were perfect to fit. We set up the frame and tested the mattress we already had. It worked great with a 10\" spring mattress. I wanted to test it before we moved so I knew if I needed a new mattress to accommodate the frame.We moved 14 days after setting up the frame. I took all the pieces apart and assembled again in our new home. This is when I found the slats working better. Before, we started at the bottom and worked to the top. This time, we started in the middle and evenly placed the slats from the middle out. We put some going to the top and then going to the bottom, alternating. I found the slats were easier to install. We didn't have the tightness as before. After assembly, it was just as fabulous as before. As for assembly, it is pretty straightforward with how it goes together. If you are not handy with tools, this will be a simple project. There is nothing complicated once you lay out all the pieces. Then you can put it together.What we like about the frame is the height of 7 inches. It gives some space under the bed for our rolling flat totes. It also allows a great height when adding out 10 inch mattress. The frame is really sturdy for two adults to be comfortable. I don't hear any squeaks and I think the 9 legs help with this. We are about 400 pounds of combined weight.With all the pros, there is always something negative to mention. The only thing we do not like about the frame would be the protectors for the 9 legs. We were able to purchase some slip covers for the legs with a non-slip bottom to keep the bed from sliding and damaging our floors. I do wish they would consider some protective boots that would go around the bottom of the legs. This seems to be an oversight with bed frame manufacturers. Our previous bed frame made of wood had sticker type things to go on the bottom of the legs. They never work and we always have to adapt to the sliding and floor damages. Even the plastic on this frame will not prevent it from sliding. This was an easy fix for us and if you have carpet flooring it wouldn't be an issue.Final thought for anyone considering a budget friendly platform frame is to jump on this product. You will be pleasantly surprised by the high quality and durability.",

                "reviewText": "I always have low expectations of cheap stuff from China. Fortunately in this case my low expectations were exceeded. The frame comes in a compact, heavy package. Despite having obviously been dropped (one end of the box was split open), nothing was damaged due to the well-engineered packing system.Assembly is trivially easy, all the parts are clearly labeled and the one-page pictoral instructions are simple to follow.The queen frame has nine legs, one at each joint. The legs each have a bolt at the top that screws into the joint from below, locking everything together. Mattress width is adjustable by a few inches, but at the smallest position the frame is the correct size for a standard 60\" queen mattress. The intermediate supports are friction fit into pockets in the rails. It's a clever design, all going together without any tools or loose hardware.The head end has brackets that will allow a headboard to be attached. You'll have to supply your own hardware and headboard if you decide to do that.The frame is metal, with the exception of the feet and some washers that go between the legs and frame. All metal is covered with a black powder coat finish that appears durable.I chose this frame because it appeared well designed and had more intermediate supports than some of the others available at this price. Also because it has short (~1\") raised metal pieces at each corner and in the middle of the outside rails to keep the mattress from slipping out of place. These will make rotating my heavy af latex mattress a little more annoying, but there's not much that can be done about that.For less than a hundred bucks it's hard to see how you could do any better. If you're looking for a low, unobtrusive platform frame, this one fits the bill.",
