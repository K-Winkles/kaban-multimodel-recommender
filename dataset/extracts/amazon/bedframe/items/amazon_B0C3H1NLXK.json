Provides great extra storage!\u25cf Daughter loves the convenient charging port location so she doesn't have to fish for her charging cord that always used to fall behind the bed.\u25cf Nook is great for daughter's books, remotes, stuffed animals, etc.\u25cf Very sturdy frameCONS:Needs more bed slats for support; we spaced them appropriately, but there's too large of a gap between slats. If you sit on the end of the mattress, you'll think you're gonna fall through for a sec. LoL! Easy fix cutting some extra slats from spare wood we had in our workshop.Overall great bed for the value; the \"wood\" does look really fake, but it's exactly as pictured. Considering buying a king size for myself and painting the \"wood\" part the color I want.",

The LED lighting may be a bit over the top with color rotation and flashing program available; handy I suppose, if you are setting up a disco in your bedroom:)Assembly isn't that difficult, but you need to put your thinking cap on some since the pictograms aren't as detailed as they might be. But all in all, it went together fairly quickly. Having a helper makes it go quicker but could be done by one person. The ratchet wrench and screwdriver is included and you don't need any additional tools to build it.The only ding I would give it is that the LED light strip plugs into one of the two outlets provided on the shelf. Though if you have a spare wall outlet, the cord is long enough to reach that as well.Nice bed!",

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the areas that were welded weren\u2019t done fully (as shown in pic).

Price was good, and delivery was prompt. However, we found it challenging to assemble. The drawings were some help, but I don\u2019t have a mechanical mind, and so 2D wasn\u2019t helpful for me. The most helpful thing was the video on the Amazon site - I watched it over and over as we assembled and it got done in 3 hours.I\u2019d definitely buy it again and gave it 5 stars because some folks find it easy to put together - I realize, I\u2019m a just a little DIY impaired.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new bedframe and this seemed the simplest with a few upgrades (shelf display, plus USB plugs). So I ordered it and it was delivered within a week. My father and I put it together and we found the instructions pretty straightforward. Thankfully, the parts are labeled and numbered (so the screws and bolts have A, B, C and the parts have 1-14) so it was straightforward to us. I will say you do need at least two people to make this thing in a day; otherwise, consider it a weekend project for one!You start off by putting together the headboard. Then you work your way to the legs and the main frame before it all comes together. The dangly bits on the slats are meant to be pushed in when you're putting the slats in to prevent the bed from making noise when you move, but they only go in when you've put the slats in correctly! It did take some trial and error when we were doing this section to get it right and they change direction when you switch sides on the slats.They include a ratcheting screwdriver, which is helpful for all the screws in the frame but if you have one of your own it makes it go that much faster for two people. My room has a wood floor, so we had to buy feet to put on the bed so it wouldn't scratch things (this isn't included in the frame so be warned if you don't plan on putting this on carpeting!).Personally, I don't care for the light function though it works just fine. But overall I really like this bed and I think it's a great buy!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this frame to replace the very standard ribbed metal frame I got from Walmart a few years ago. It\u2019s an awesome frame. It only took me 45 minutes on my own to set it up with very clear instructions and no issues, no missing pieces at all and everything was in great condition.The only issue I had, and this is not the sellers fault, is the box had like greasy dirt all over it, likely from the flight to Ontario from Alberta, so I couldn\u2019t lay it on the floor.But once I got the pieces out it was a simple and quick process of putting it all together. They give you a few handy tools and I have to really compliment the ingenious design of the metal slats. They both clip in and then have rubber plugs to ensure they\u2019re going absolutely nowhere after they\u2019re installed. The headboard with the handy plugs, usb ports and the slick led strip are also a really nice touch to complete this unit. And it\u2019s very VERY sturdy and doesn\u2019t take up a huge amount of space.I\u2019m very impressed and pleased with this purchase. A must buy if you\u2019re looking for something a bit more jazzy than your standard metal frame but not big and bulky like those fancy wooden frames.I don\u2019t usually give five stars but this definitely surpassed my expectations so it deserves it.",
