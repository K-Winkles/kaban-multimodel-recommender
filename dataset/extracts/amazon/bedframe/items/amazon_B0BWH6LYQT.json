The gaskets only cost me an extra 15-20 bucks not too difficult to find it. It would\u2019ve been easier. Had they been associated with the bedframe, but overall good purchase.",

I figured the weight acceptance would suffice for the way she throws herself on her bed, to say she is hard on furniture would be an understatement. She has destroyed every bed she's ever had, either pulling parts off or breaking them during meltdowns.Unfortunately this bed did not stand up to her either. It might have if it was on carpet because it's a great sturdy bed frame, but it's light enough that when she throws herself on it (she's not a tiny girl) she had caused the middle legs to bend and today I awoke to find that one of the legs had bent to the point of breaking.I image this would be a great bed for someone who will just sleep in it, but not for someone who is going to have giant meltdowns or move around a lot with the bed on a non carpeted floor.",
