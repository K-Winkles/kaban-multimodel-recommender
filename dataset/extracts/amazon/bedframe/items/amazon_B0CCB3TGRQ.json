Mattress slides off the frame. Now I have to figure out how to keep the mattress in place. Guess it isn't made for a foam/gel mattress. 2/10/24 good customer service from seller. Issues have been resolved.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these bed frame mattress holders! They are solid steel, very well built, and sturdy. They seem like they would be near impossible to bend or break so they should last forever. It's a very simple idea and they work amazingly well. They look great installed and blend right in with the right color sheets. If you have a metal bed frame without a box spring you know the pain and hassle of having to readjust your mattress every night. It's a huge pain and a waste of time. These mattress holders take care of the problem completely so you never even have to think about adjusting your mattress ever again. You can even install them over a bed skirt if you need to and as an added benefit they keep your bed skirt from moving as well. The set comes with 6 of them two for each of the sides and two for the bottom with the top of the mattress held in place by your wall. The set comes with everything you need! Since using these I haven't had to adjust anything and the bed just stays where it should. These things are worth their weight in gold.",
