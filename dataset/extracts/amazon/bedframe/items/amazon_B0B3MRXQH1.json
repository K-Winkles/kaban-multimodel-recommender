Immediately upon delivery, I was impressed by how well it was packaged and how gorgeous the wood is in person. It\u2019s stunning and shows zero signs of damage or flaws from shipping. Assembly took me less than an hour, and I did this by myself as a 35 year old woman, without any need for additional tools. Everything was easily identifiable through the instructions and the parts fit perfectly.I also bought the matching bedside tables and the whole set up is gorgeous!10/10",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for a platform frame in a natural finish with clean lines AND we were working on a budget so we were really excited to find this bed. It's a king so I definitely needed help to build it, but assembly was extremely easy. Holes were all drilled properly and all dowels are very secure. It was packed very well, no damage to any of the wood, and it just looks absolutely perfect in our room. The slats are even with the frame, so the mattress doesn't drop down at all to keep it in place but ours doesn't move around at all so not an issue to me, you really only see it when the bed isn't made. It's a gamble to order furniture online because you never know what condition it will arrive in, but again the producer did a great job packing and protecting the pieces which was a huge relief! Would definitely recommend!",

Numbered stickers for parts end up being hidden after assembly. Best of all after reading all the reviews from 1 to 5 rating we encountered none of the problems that others had. The bed is solid and looks very nice. I would suggest being careful when torquing the bolts based on other reviews. Snug plus 1/2 turn was my method and it seemed adequate. When we rotate the mattress in the future I will check for bolt tightness. Overall a solid frame and easy and well written assembly process/instruction makes this a good consideration.",
