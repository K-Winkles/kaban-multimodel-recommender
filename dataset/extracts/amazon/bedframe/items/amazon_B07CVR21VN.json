                "reviewText": "Came on time and as described.My 15 year old grandson put this together for me in about 20 minutes. The hardest part was balancing parts while securing two pieces. He got assistance from little brothers and it went smoothly.It was light enough for us to turn on it's side while we brought it through the bedroom door fully assembled, and set it on the floor without issue. Sturdy after a few months use, I can't find fault with it at all!For me, I found that without the need of a boxspring the mattress just sits upon the bars -which is fine and hasn't been any trouble except tucked in sheets make fall and or hang down which -to me- looks untidy. My solution was to purchase a simple sheet of masonite, cut it to size, and secure it to the bars with \"AlienTape\". I put a large piece of bubble shelf liner between the masonite and the mattress (in the center) to keep it from sliding, which has been fine.The height of the frame along with a new mattress is high, but not too high to get into. I am 5'4\" and have arthritis and I can still manage. If you have physical issues getting in a higher bed or if you are a bit shorter you may want a lower height on the legs for safety.The amount of storage under the bed is enormous! As my 12 year old grandson said \"We could camp under here!\" My original intent was to place large baskets underneath, but I like the look of it without anything under the bed, and it's much easier to keep the floor clean!BOTTOM LINE: A great value for a simple design, easily assembled, with PLENTY of storage!",

                "reviewText": "I've been a spring-mattress guy my whole life. Not sure I'll ever go with full memory-foam or sleep-number air. However, as a mostly side-sleeper shopping for a new mattress, I did want to try an added foam-layer to better accommodate my shoulders for possibly less night-time side-to-side flipping. This Best Price 10\" Euro-top pocket-spring mattress (with decent reviews) seemed to me a good way to give this a try, especially at under $200 for their full-size.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Can't yet talk about how this will hold up over time, but still sleeping comfortably on my new mattress after several weeks of use. The mattress side-support is fairly soft, so hoping I don't see too much shape distortion (bowing-out) as time passes. Will also be interesting to see how those comfort-foam layers of the Euro-top withstand the test of time.I still occasionally turn from side-to-side due to some firmness under my shoulders but, for less than $200 for the full-size 10\" Euro-top version, I'm rating this 4-stars as a good mattress buy.Always appreciate feedback ... If you find this review helpful, please feel free to give it a quick 'Yes'. Thanks.FULL-size Euro-top (10-inch) mattress details:- Shipped in 17\" x 20\" x 40\" box. Weighs 70-pounds so recommend a 2-wheel dolly or 2nd person to help carry, especially if you have steps to climb.- Mattress has standard full-size footprint of 74-75\" length x 53-54\" width. Fit my previous standard full-size box-spring perfectly.- Coil-count for the full-size is 22 x 31 = 682 total coil-count.- I chose to have shipped from Best Price. Mattress tag shows manufacture date as 201610 (Oct 2016), about 6-months before my order date. Also shows Made in China.Receiving/Unpacking:The thick cardboard shipping box looked like it had been around the block a few times before it was delivered. Sides bowed-out and fairly worn/dirty looking, however still mostly taped-shut and in one-piece. Pleasantly surprised that the mattress inside is very well packaged and remained in perfect shape.The packaging is fairly ingenious IMO. The mattress is actually vacuum-packed and hermetically sealed into a hefty clear-plastic bag. This vacuum-packing compresses the 10\" mattress down to just a couple of inches thick. Pretty much like those advertised vacuum storage-bags that reduce your stack of blankets or pillows down to the thickness of a set of sheets.My compressed & sealed full-size mattress was then folded in half length-wise (Euro-top/foam-side outward), rolled up from side to side, then wrapped with another plastic/foam layer. As I mentioned, very well packaged.I carefully cut away the outer plastic/foam layer and unfolded the compressed mattress onto my box-spring. As I then cut down the edge of the vacuum-bag, thought it was kind of neat how quickly the mattress expanded to full thickness as the air rushed into it. Fully removed the vacuum bag and my work was done. They recommend 48-hours for full decompression, but I think I could've slept on mine almost immediately.My mattress had a slight new-odor smell to it when first unpacked. I'd say similar to the odor of a new pair of sneakers when you first take them out of the shoe-box. Not overwhelming by any means, and that 'new mattress smell' mostly dissipated away over the first few days after being released from its sealed plastic shipping bag.Mattress & comfort:- The unpacked/decompressed mattress was beautiful. No apparent flaws or discolored areas. No mattress-buttons to feel through the sheets. I always use a washable quilted mattress-cover to help protect the mattress top & sides, and this slid on with no issues. Also no fit issues using my standard full-size sheets.- The single-sided mattress (can't flip this one) uses a slightly coarser/rougher low-slip material on the bottom. As someone who props the headboard of my bed up a couple-inches to help avoid the occasional acid-reflux issue, I'm really a fan of this mattress not sliding down the box-spring nearly as much over time (my previous mattress slid down a bit every night).- With its 12-gauge coils (many mattresses I shopped, use 14-gauge [or thinner] coils), I'd rate this mattress on the Firm side. I'm fine sleeping with the high-support of a firm mattress, but feel the extra foam layers of the Euro-top do add a level of comfort. However, due to the extra squish of the add'l Euro-top foam layers, I did end up replacing my firm pillows with something medium-soft. My previous firm pillows sitting on top of the mattress foam, held my head just a bit too high for my taste.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great bed frame. It was so easy to assemble. The directions were easy to read and follow. The parts are given letters but the screw holes were numbered. You put screw hole #1 with screw hole #1 together. It couldn't have been any easier. They even give you extra parts just in case you need them. This is extremely sturdy. My step daughter has a similar frame and when you saw this one she said, \"Wow yours looks so much sturdier than mine because of the center bars and the metal seems to be a little heavier\". The frame is 18\" tall and you can put totes (the totes I have are 16\" high and I believe that is standard) under the bed for added storage! So many other bed frames talk about the frames being too big for their mattress. This is approximately 1/2\" bigger than the mattress, which I believe is good so the side are supported well. The corners seems to be covered by my comforter but if yours doesn't then you can use pool noodles or \"bumpers\" on the corners to protect you in case you were to bump into them. I'm unsteady at times but have not had any issues bumping into the corners. I would highly recommend this frame to any of my friends and family. Just buy it you won't regret it.",
