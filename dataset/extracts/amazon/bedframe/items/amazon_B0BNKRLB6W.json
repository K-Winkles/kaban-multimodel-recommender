The instructions where not very good when it came to details because the size difference in bolts between what they have on the instructions and what is included in the kit but its not like your building a rocket. When it came to the headboard (bought separately) which was the whole reason I bout this frame, I had some problems. Really would have been nice if they had included just a couple of bolts for the headboard but they do not. The bed frame is extra wide so attaching the headboard was a little tricky. I had to bend the headboard poles a little bit to get them to line up with the slots on the frame. Overall it's a decent frame and the height of the bed is great for storing stuff under the bed. If I had known it was going to be wider than the headboard I would have gotten a different frame though. I would recommend you MEASURE CAREFULLY before ordering and just know you're probably going to lose a few toes due to the middle legs on either side. All in all I would recommend but just make sure you measure before because standard sizes don't apply on things that are EXTRA wide or EXTRA long.",
