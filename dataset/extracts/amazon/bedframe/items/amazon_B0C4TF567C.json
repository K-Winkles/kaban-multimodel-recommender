                "reviewText": "This platform bedframe was pretty quick to set up (about 30 minutes on my own), it's very sturdy (and with a weight rating of 2000 pounds, pretty much the entire family can climb up on there and bounce around), and due to it's height, offers a good amount of storage space underneath it (you'll need to buy your own storage containers separately).The frame sets up with a small inset to help keep the mattress from moving around (it's not impossible, but less likely).I like that it has holes built into some of the legs incase you want to add a headboard later, little feet to preserve the floors and it was nice they provide some padding on some legs to help prevent nasty toe stubs.The frame comes packed in a box that's roughly 4'Hx2'Wx5\"D and weighs almost 40 pounds.This is a simple bedframe with some very thoughtful touches at a reasonable price. Great for first-time apartments/homes, families on a budget or people who like to keep things minimalist.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Solid frame with a few concerns",
                "reviewText": "Assembly of this frame took about 30 min despite an error in the manual. The resulting frame is very solid and silent. Seems to work fine without a box spring and has tons of storage underneath without changing the height of the bed.I have to call out how incomprehensible it is that the part numbers for metric screws were chosen to be M1-M4. Those have a real meaning in terms of screw sizes but are not the sizes of the included screws. It's just that the manufacturer chose the most confusing labels for arbitrary part numbers. This creates such gems as \"M2 M8\" and \"M3 M8\" which apparently even confused the person writing the manual because they got the labels backwards. The manual calls for M2x4 screws but there aren't 4. There are 4 of the M3 labeled ones. Both are actually size M8 but are different lengths. Would be sooo much better if the screws were S1-S4 and someone did proofreading.The other minor issues are: None of the screws have thread locker on them so I suspect they will loosen and start to squeak after a while. They advertise toe protection but only two supports on the sides are padded and that padding doesn't extend to the floor. When we've stubbed toes it's usually on the corners and there is no padding there. So plan to stub your toes only on the side of the bed and only a few inches above the ground.Lastly, if you have an existing headboard or are shopping for one to fit this frame make sure it has mountings below 12\". This isn't the fault of this frame but I discovered my headboard is designed to mount higher off the floor because it was design for a specific bed frame. I had to rig my own mount because I didn't check.",

It gives enough space under the bed to easily store under bed bins without having to force them in, plus a few additional boxes in the back part of the bed that we don't need to access often. It is also very comfortable so far. I haven't missed having box springs.",

After the assembly was completed it felt solid and sturdy so I thought it was well made and all was well for a month up until I had to move it to another side of the room. Unfortunately, while moving it I have noticed already developing cracks in the welds of the metal frame where the legs are connected to the base frame. I am not sure I feel safe to use it now and it definitely does not look like a durable frame anymore to me. There are definitely way better quality frames out there so I would recommend to get something else and avoid this brand.",

The thing that I like the most about this bed frame is the amount of space it has and how tall it is so many items fit in the bottom. You also can use this without a box. Great value for the money considering you only have to buy the frame and not a box. it is also very sturdy.",
