However, the reason why I gave it a 4 star rating was that the instructions were not 100% clear or accurate. It took me longer than needed to build it due to the fact that a single part was misused in the instructions manual. It told me to place two different pieces in the same area and was confused to the point where I had to YouTube the build. Later to find out, the piece that was incorrect was the crossbar to support the mattress. If that gets fixed in the manual, it will be a 5/5 stars. I believe the piece was labeled as \"i\" that needs to be revised in the manual on page 3 or 4.",

I can\u2019t brag enough about how easy the seller was to work with",
