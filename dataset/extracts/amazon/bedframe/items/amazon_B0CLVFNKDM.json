Material is super soft as well. OnlyComplaint is the stickers with the numbers are impossible to get off in one swoop. Bed is sturdy asf. All the hardware was good! Only have had it one night so not sure on longevity or how it sustains motion lol but upon completion of assembly it\u2019s cool! Doesn\u2019t look cheap at all. And the lights have a bunch of options. If you want this bed definitely get it!",

                "reviewText": "This purchase was for sure worth it. The bedframe is very sturdy and stable. There is zero noise when getting on the bed, being in it, moving around, it\u2019s very quiet which I love so much. It sits very low to the ground so be aware of that. I think it\u2019s a beautiful bed frame and looks great in person. The led lights and motion sensor lights are both neat and work as they should. It\u2019s a very heavy bed frame to move around in the box, 2 people is preferred to move it. I did all the putting together of the bed frame and moving it around myself, but having 2 people would help a lot. It does take time to put together the frame, every bit of 2+ hours, but it\u2019s worth it I promise. The fabric feels nice to the touch, I love the recessed area above the headboard, it\u2019s nice for holding my phone and the built in charging ports are amazing to have and convenient. I definitely recommend this bed frame to anyone who is looking at this product. I was skeptical about buying it at first because at the time there were no reviews and it was newly released on Amazon, but I went for it and I\u2019m happy I did. My package had no damage to it whatsoever, all parts and pieces were included, nothing was missing. I highly recommend this bed frame to anyone interested in a new queen size frame like I was.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely love this bed frame, it is short than expected but when you think about how tall normal bed frames are it\u2019s definitely taller. The LED lights are SIIICCKKKK. The motion sensory lights are also a nice touch, works as a great nightlight for when you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. The material it\u2019s made from is soft and good quality. It took awhile to put together but definitely worth it it\u2019s sturdy and doesn\u2019t move around or make noises doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Sometimes with bed frames your pillows sink down into the crack behind your pillow but with this bed frame it keeps the bed in place against the bed frame so your pillows don\u2019t do that. Would definitely be careful about stubbing your toe when making the bed though but I mean as with any bed frame it\u2019s tradition. WORTH EVERY PENNY.",

                "reviewText": "The bed looks nice and looks like the picture on the site, only thing I see as a negative is the headboard isn't as tall as I expected but nothing to give it less stars for. The lights work well and the whole setup was pretty straightforward with the picture diagrams. Seems very sturdy, and it came boxed well and nothing was damaged. I will say that because of the weight of the item don't expect the carrier to put it in the appropriate place when they deliver it because of the weight. It will definitely take two people at least to get into the house and in your room. Feels really nice to the touch. Don't regret the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The bed frame beat my expectations! It's very sturdy and the instructions are fairly clear. The only problem I had were issues with the holes for wire control as they were just slightly to large for the screws. Since this didn't affect the structural integrity I just used small pieces of tape to keep the wires from having down. Other that that I have no complaints. It took me and my husband about 4 hours to assemble the bed frame.",
