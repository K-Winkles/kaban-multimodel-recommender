                "reviewText": "We purchased the King Size 18\u201d. I wasn\u2019t sure if this frame would *actually* be good quality or not due to reviews. Super glad I took the risk. It was a happy surprise to find it made of good quality & durable materials. It is secure, but very easy to set up. I especially love the underside storage ability due to the fact that there truly is 18\u201d under the frame to work with. Great Bed! (Also,\u2026 haven\u2019t noticed any noses or loud creaks thus far!)",

                "reviewText": "Bought this bed frame for the height and because it said it was a 'noise-free' frame. Well lemme tell you what, this sucker is louder than cat getting its tail shut in a door, more noisy than a child playing with an air horn, and as disruptive as a freight train rolling through a small town, blowing its whistle all crazy.EVERY little move, any time you roll over, or sit down on it, this bed frame is unbelievably loud. So much that i had to return it.If you're an adult who enjoys a little 'roll-in-the-hay' with your partner, this frame is so loud that you'll have your neighbors leaving post it notes on your front door, asking you to tone it down a bit. (True story \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09)Frame is also not sturdy, the only cool thing about it, is the height if it. Pretty well off the ground so you can stuff a bunch of crap under it which is nice.Would not recommend buying.",
