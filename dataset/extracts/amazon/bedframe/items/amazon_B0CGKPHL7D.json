The only mix up is that in one picture in the instructions you assemble 3 slats across the frame with 6 screws but the instructions say 4. Obvious typo. The company provides extra screws and this part had 7 so 6 were definitely required. It was screw type M in case you run into the same issue. Otherwise I was done in about 45 minutes. Very easy, and everything aligned perfectly. Tried to add photo but Amazon says settings don't allow it even though my settings do allow it....another glitch. No worries.",

If you have two people it\u2019ll take 45 min at most- the most tedious part are the first 2 steps when you have to screw 24 screws. It\u2019s very easy to build, instructions are clear, everything you need is provided for you. Keep in mind this is a budget bedframe so the frame itself looks just ok, but the headboard makes it looks better. It gets the job done for a guest room or temporary living- works better than the floor haha",
