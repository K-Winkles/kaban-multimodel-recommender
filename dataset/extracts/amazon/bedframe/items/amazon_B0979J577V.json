It assembles easily with 2 people. The picture instructions could be clearer but we figured it out. Very pleased and would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Okay. So I was a little worried about buying this since the other reviews stated they needed to order an extra part. I definitely agree the manufacturer should make the middle 'I' beams shorter so there is no confusion. However, it is possible to put this bed together well without needing customer service to send another part. This is how I did it:Do not screw the perimeter platform screws in all of the way. I think these are 'G' and 'H'. Let them be loose. Then when everything is put together, you will be able to get G and H into the holes and tighten them. But if you put the bed together as the instructions say by tightening the I parts last, it won't work because the center part is too long when the side parts are screwed in all the way. I was able to put the bed together and thought maybe I would have to bend something but the bed went together perfectly (with a little muscle) and the end beams tightened up fine after I already put the center beam in. It doesn't need to be that confusing but it is and it is a relatively easy workaround and saved me having to call or do anything else. I had the bed put together by myself in less than an hour. And I've been sleeping on it for 3 weeks now with no issues. It doesn't creak and it feels very sturdy. I did hit my leg on the end but I always do that on beds with footboards.",

The pieces anre not flimsy metal and the frame is as sturdy as the Room and Board frame (costing 5x more) whose joints collapsed on me.",

                "reviewText": "My husband I were needing a new frame with headboard and foot board, but didn't want to spend a ton of money. We have a very small room so we needed something that would not take up a lot of space. This bed is very sturdy! everything came wrapped in cellophane, no damage. It came with all the tools needed to assemble and the instructions were very easy to follow. I was able to put it together my self in about 45 minutes. Two people would be much quicker for when you have to hold a piece up to attach it to the frame. The frame weighs about 75 lbs. We only have our mattress, and put the bed on risers to have storage space underneath. It hasn't moved an inch! We are very pleased with this bed! !",
