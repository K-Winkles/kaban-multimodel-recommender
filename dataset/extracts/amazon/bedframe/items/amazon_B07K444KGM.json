                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a canopy bed for quite some time, and I kept coming back to this one over and over again. At first, I thought it looked too \"IKEA\" and \"MALM-y\", but the quality is far beyond what I imagined, and once dressed, it looks quite impressive, sturdy, and centers the bedroom.Design + Construction:So I read a few reviews before I purchased/assembled this beast. For those who say this is a 1-person job, you must also be a beast! This frame is 95% metal, 5% being these funky plastic connectors for the slates. But even the slates are metal! The instructions were pretty straightforward, just make sure you make note of all the steps (for example, you assemble the base frame upside down and you have to flip it before you attach it to the posts. I didn't and had to go back, and it was a pain). Any case, this is a 2-person job!Some of the reviews also mentioned that over time the bed starts to squeak and creak. I can understand why, as the bed is metal-on-metal. The seams are tight, but if this bed gets any action it'll definitely start squeaking. So I bought some gray, thick duck tape and padded/lined nearly all joints. LOL, it certainly added to the construction time, but I think it was worth it. An added benefit was that it made some of the joints a tighter fit, minimizing any rattling parts (for example, 2/3 of the headrest bars insert into the posts and the 3rd bar screws in and holds all in place. I wrapped duct tape around each end before insertion).The only thing I don't like about the construction of this piece is the middle support bar (the one with the baby legs). Those legs are wobbly and will pivot one way or another over time. Lots of beds use this type of support beam, so it's not a problem unique to this frame, but it's something you'll definitely have to check every once and awhile. A simple lifting of the base will rectify this problem as it occurs. And it's really not a structural issue (IMO) as the cross bars (all 20+ of them) are metal and insert into the side beams.Comfort and Durability:As I said, this bed is pure metal! It's not going anywhere. In fact, once I finished constructing it, I was worried about how I'd ever get it out of our bedroom. I don't think I can... LOL. I'll have to sell with the room. I kid, but not really. There are so many components and structural pieces that I would hate the task of disassembly. That said, this bed isn't completely immobile. Tight joints and all, it still sways... if just slightly. I double-tightened everything.Comrfort-wise, this is a super supportive frame. There's no give, so your mattress won't sink in here or there. It looks best without a box spring, but I suppose you can add one on. It is about 11' off the ground, which is great for storage boxes and for my corgi who lives under the bed. I toss and turn a lot and not once did I hear a squeak (again, I think my duct taping skills paid off). One thing I did was put cotton pads on the posts + middle support beams. I have hardwood floors and since this weighs so much, I didn't want it to scratch anything.Last Things:- I like how it feels like I'm sleeping in a fort.- The canopy bars are GREAT for laundry! I dump laundry on the bed, place hangers up on the high beam and crank out that tedious chore in no time. Saves you the trouble of going back and forth to put things away in the closet.- The finish is semi-gloss grey. It's pretty.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my bedroom with this chic bed frame, and I'm absolutely loving it. The design is sleek, featuring square lines and a built-in headboard that effortlessly blends timeless style with a modern edge. What impressed me most was how easy it was to put together. The sturdy metal frame came with clear instructions, and I didn't need any extra tools or help.(although having a second person would have made it a tad easier to put up, but iwas able to do it just myself) It's designed with built-in metal slats and additional legs, so I could say goodbye to my old box spring, which was a huge plus. The option to add curtains gives it a versatile look, though I'm enjoying the open design for now. It comfortably supports up to 450 lbs, and honestly, there's nothing I don't like about it. It's a solid, attractive choice for anyone looking to refresh their bedroom without any hassle.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic bed, with a few simple tweaks",
                "reviewText": "I'll start by saying I didn't really know what to expect with this bed. My wife and I spent literally a combined 4 or so hours pouring over reviews and, while the vast majority are positive, the negative ones were concerning. I've read about missing, damaged parts, fitment issues where bolt holes don't line up and, arguably the worst of the bunch, squeaking and a lack of sturdiness. I'm pleased say, now that mine is put together and we've slept on it, we couldnt be happer with it. If it helps for anyone, here are some tips..- First and foremost be very careful removing the parts from the box. We had a few small scratches on some pieces and I suspect they were scratched going into the box or by me removing them because we had zero box damage. So, the only part of that you can control is how carefully you take the parts out. Be careful not to bang one part into the next.- Do an inventory and make sure to account for every piece in the item list in the manual. For obvious reasons.- Make sure to have threadlocker on hand. One of the complaints I've read over and over was about the bolts unscrewing themselves over time. Manfacturers of this type of furniture often times send their hardware with a dab of threadlocker on each bolt, typically just a spot of blue toward the end. This manufacturer doesn't, so spend the 6 bucks on blue threadlocker and save yourself some headaches.- Look at every assembly step in the instructions twice before doing anything. The instructions are clear if you take the time to take a good look.- Use felt on as many metal-on-metal contact points as you can. We used a pack of the felt funiture pads..the ones with the adhesive on one side for putting on furniture legs. This helps cut down on any clanking or squeaking and, in the cast of the 5 small legs, with making the fit more snug.- On our unit, the 5 support legs did not reach the ground. In fact they were just about an inch short of making contact. I made shims with small blocks of wood to help with this. For those reviewers that mentioned the legs buckling and bending in one direction or the other, I'd guess thats because their legs weren't shimmed. If the legs don't make contact and you get in bed, chances are they'll bend one way or the other on the way down from the pressure of the weight. The shims helped to firmly plant the legs against the floor.We have a new king sized Sleep Number mattress which, if put on a platform, requires slat spacing of no more than 2 inches. The metal slat spacing on this are much wider so we opted to make bunkie boards out of plywood and canvas. Between my wife and I, we weigh approximately 450. The bed is sturdy, quiet and supportive enough that we have every confidence it will last. There is zero noise getting in and out of bed or while rolling over or engaging in \"bed wrestling.\"That all said, no regrets at all about the purchase. One star off for the fact that it's not perfect without some tweaks but, for the price point, I can't say enough about it.TL/DR-Take the parts out of the box very carefully to avoid damage-Do an inventory of parts-Use threadlocker to make sure bolts stay put-Shim legs where necessary to make sure they make contact with the floor-Use felt on metal-on-metal contact points to cut down on noise and make sure everything fits snugly",
