                "reviewText": "A great buy overall considering how well it's made. I ordered the walnut stained one and it's absolutely beautiful and looks great with the rest of my furniture.Putting it together took about 10 minutes and they way they set it up for easy assembly is pretty genius. I am always a bit weary of these slide-in brackets because I feel like they give too much side to side flex but it's holding up fine so I can't complain too much. The slats are also very thick, study, and they sit in an ingenious indented area that the maker carved out specially for them.My only \"complaints\" if you can call it that is that it didn't come with any rubber soles for the bottom of the legs which mean the bed has the opportunity to slide a bit (on hardwood floors) if you manage to bump it, especially if you have a light mattress like I do. Not gonna dock a star for this though because it's a $5 dollar \"fix\" and it comes down to preference. I might also put another support underneath the middle support bar, not that it needs it, just for an extra back up.Overall it's extremely sturdy and the craftsmanship on it is something to behold. The kind of stuff you would expect from an american made product.",

                "reviewText": "We have an very active, 130 lbs., pre-teen child with Autism who likes to jump into his bed (a lot).Zach has been the end of 3 highly rated metal frame beds in the last six month. Two we purchased on Amazon and were advertised as being strong in that they can handle a lot of weight. They are all now in the metal dumpster at our local recycling center. Most of those beds, it seems are designed for vertical weight and rather sedentary vertical weight at that.Zach's jumping into bed on his heavy foam (springs failed too) mattress puts lateral force that twists and bends the metal frames. Once they are bent, its only a matter of time to failures since the bent metal results in lost rigidity and eventfully falling apart. Of the last two attempts, one bed lasted only one week the other lasted 3 weeks. We joked Zach Bed Room = Bed Frame Doom.Before we decided to go the mattress on the floor solution... we decided to take a long short on this wooden bed. My wife had her doubts, especially since it did not have a middle support feet and was a bit pricey. We also had had prior wood frame childhood beds for our other children that although were ok, they were not up to Zach level of tough.Result is we could not be happier with this bed. This is no ordinary wood bed. Honestly, it is (almost) over engineered for it strength. The wood is of high quality and the slats are very strong and plentiful.We suspect the accountants that try and cost reduce everything and sacrifice quality probably did not make the product planning meeting when this bed was conceived. They have built a very good bed from very good materials and they are charging a very, very fair price for it.Cost is over discussed and good value is under appreciated. This product is of the highest value for our family and we cannot endorse it enough for others with similar special needs challenges.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this bed frame. It was super easy to assemble. But I did have a little trouble getting the support beam in, because it was a very tight fit. Instead of pushing it straight down into the slots, I had to push it down in a different section of the bed, and then slide it over and down. The bed seems solid. It does occasionally creak. I'm hoping it holds up when I really put it to the test. I'm thinking about putting some sections of plywood over the slats. My Tuft and Needle mattress recommends 4 inches or less between the slats, and this is just over 5.My one complaint, is that it smelled horrible when I first set it up. I got the black one, and I think it was very freshly stained/painted. The chemical smell was very strong and gave me a headache. I had to leave all the windows open and a fan on, for a week. I can still smell it a little, but it's not irritating now. That was really not fun, and it was cold out at the time. But the smell does eventually fade.",

                "reviewText": "I never write reviews unless there is a problem. This time I'm writing because I feel that this company deserves credit for an amazing product. I purchased these as bases for beds for foster children. I am 5'1\" and 105 pound single woman. I purchased two of the gray ones and they arrived in only a few days. They were in impeccable packing. The wood is solid and beautiful. I was actually able to lift the package into my house by myself and then carried it in pieces into the bedroom. I had watched the video prior, but it took less than 10 minutes (per base) for me to put them together. I never once had to look at directions. It's just that easy and fool-proof. The bases are so sturdy that I imagine that these will last a lifetime. The fact that they were made in the USA is important to me and I am incredibly impressed with the quality of this product. I would purchase it again in a heartbeat! I've never received a product with a handwritten \"thank you\" note before but that was such an amazing personal touch. They've thought of everything and I want to acknowledge that it was noticed!",

                "reviewText": "This bed is nice looking and easy to assemble, but not great quality. The slats continuously fall out of their slots and now apparently the frame has bowed enough that the slats aren't long enough to touch the slots they are supposed to fit into. We're going to have to find a way to clamp it together and screw the slats into place, or replace the bed. It has only been in use for 6 or 7 months so I would hate to have to buy another frame already.",
