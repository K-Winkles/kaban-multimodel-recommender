                "reviewText": "This worked great for what we needed. There were a lot of pieces, but it was super easy to put together. It comes with all the tools to assemble it, but a ratchet and/or drill will make it much easier. Large 27gal totes fit perfectly underneath which is the main reason I purchased it, extra storage. Between my boyfriend and I, we are about 500lbs and it is holding up great.After a couple of months of using it, it is still holding well but has started making noise every time we move. We are both very restless sleepers and we toss and turn all night. The creaking wakes us up which is unfortunate. I am still trying to figure out how to remedy this situation but other than that it has been great.",

Just keep in mind the included braces are not sufficient for support of a memory phone mattress. It needs slats or a base on top.It's silent and very strong. Easy to assemble for 1 person. It fits Coleman Coolers of what I would say are considered average size and it fits 102L home depot storage bins. You should be able to fit 8 102 L bins under this bed. Great for extra sheets etc.Ours is an 18\" tall King",

I've been sleeping on it attaching workout equipment to it and overall just really putting it through its paces. It's basically indestructible. I was afraid it being a metal frame it would squeak it doesn't. There's enough room underneath it for storage. And aesthetically it's pretty simple and awesome. Another bonus is in my opinion it's the perfect height off the ground. Overall 10 out of 10 this is the exact type of bed frame that I'd like to have.",
