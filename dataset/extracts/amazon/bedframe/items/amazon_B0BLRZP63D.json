                "reviewText": "First off, HEAVY. Not a lightweight dinky thing. I\u2019m disabled, but I had trouble moving the box inside, had to get creative about how I moved it. Once you open the box, the individual pieces are much more manageable.You might want two people for assembly if you\u2019re not the strongest person. It also helps just because then there\u2019s someone to stabilize while you do the real assembly.Super cheap, and I don\u2019t think I could break this if I tried. If you order the taller height, so. Much. Storage. I\u2019ve been shoving space bags and file boxes and all kinds of stuff under there, and it\u2019s so easy to retrieve because again the height makes it easy to maneuver things.Looks fine, but it will be slightly bigger than the king mattress it supports if you get that size. And those metal edges are not my friend, I smack myself on things like that and easily injure myself if I\u2019m not careful.Solution? POOL NOODLES!!! Not even kidding. Slice one side of them, then wrap them around the exposed metal bits. Perfect size for this use, then you just throw a bed skirt on and it hides that. Then, even in the dark, when you\u2019re trying to stumble into bed for sleep, even if you SLAM a shin against that side of the bed, nothing.Keeps my mattress perfectly level and supported with the many, many slats it includes. No sinking spots, no issues. And it can either fit into an existing old school frame with the headboard attached or it has a place to attach a headboard.I\u2019d buy it again.",

Just one thing, only for one person. You may not want to exceed the weight limit, as it make it less sturdy over time. Other than that, great bed frame. Would go well with a memory foam mattress and memory foam topper, you will feel like you're sleeping in a fine hotel. Just add a nice comforter, duvet cover and plush down pillows and you're all set ! Purchased twin size frame",

Comes in a 38-inch box that can be easily transported and weights 26 pounds.Cons: if it can be called a negative - had some minor scratches from the shipping, but I did not experience any damage parts like other reviewers have reported.Other thoughts: I used 2 of these frames to create a small king-sized bed (two regular twins put together). It fit my needs perfectly. I did put some cardboard in between the frame and the mattresses to prevent the mattresses from sagging in-between the frame supports.",
