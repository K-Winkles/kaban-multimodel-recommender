I love that it\u2019s a lower platform but still leaves room to store things underneath. Great for a small bedroom in particular to lower the visual weight yet allow room for storage. Very easy and fairly quick to put together, coming from a single woman with no construction skills. The only downside is no headboard, but at this price point you can\u2019t be too picky, and it\u2019d be easy enough to custom make one. All in all it\u2019s a great buy and would highly recommend!",

The Expresso is beautiful, not too dark.I\u2019ll start by saying THANK YOU for wrapping the styrofoam. The tools sent were also great! The velcro to help the slats stay in place is very needed and appreciated.My daughter is extremely happy, no noises so far, it\u2019s sturdy, solid, and was super easy to set up alone.

The only drawback is that the slats are glued to a fabric border with velcro attached to the underside of that fabric border. The slats are thin both in height and width. The stats are placed on the velcro bands on either side of the inside of the frame. It's pretty flimsy it there are two adults sleeping in that bed. For a guest room that is rarely used, it is fine.",

                "reviewText": "Actual wood. Not sure what kind, but it's not MDF, or some other pseudo-wood. Instructions aren't the greatest, but it's quite simple to understand how it goes together. They include a little ratchet (pictured) which makes everything fast and easy. (They include a regular L-shaped hex as well, I guess for people who are daunted by a ratchet?)I was a little worried because one corner of the box had a nasty ding. (See pic) But it's double-boxed and everything was fine. They even put the styrofoam packing in plastic bags, so those little beads don't get all over the place.The design and engineering is quite good. I put it together by myself. Unpacking and assembly took less than an hour. The hardest part of the entire process was getting the slats on. They are attached with velcro, so it took a bit of patience to get them lined up. Overall, very pleased with the quality and thought that went into this under-$100 platform bed (I got the twin.) And including the ratchet was a nice touch.",
