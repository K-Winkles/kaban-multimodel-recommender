We have had ours for four or so months now, and I will say that you are going to want to retighten the fasteners after a while. My husband and I are both over 300 pounds, so it\u2019s definitely sturdy to hold us and our big dog. Great for the price point especially.3633",

With that being said the leg is bowed in the the support bars don\u2019t fit all the way across and it caused it to collapse it claims to hold 3000 pounds not that we needed that with us and our mattress and 2 dogs. But my 100 pound dog jumped from the floor to the bed which caused all the support bars to come off sending me tumbling. Not a fun moment for anyone I\u2019m sure but at 7 months pregnant it\u2019s very scary. If you look at the picture I had to leave the bars that far off one side to even reach the middle bracket the bed frame was easy to assemble and tbh if the bars was a little longer it would be almost perfect as a frame unfortunately my only options is return and wait on a refund or replace with the exact same product then return meaning I would be left with a mattress on the floor again trying to get up at 7 months pregnant",

                "reviewText": "I gotta say I'm a bit disappointed, the frame looks great and works great. However, I ordered a queen pair for a queen too I only have a queen mattress, I received however a king size. Initially I thought maybe it's adjustable, but the instructions simply said full, queen, King. Which, is not a size. There's no one size fits all for a mattress especially with a frame such as this without tripping on your way out of bed and possibly breaking a leg. Sadly I never used it I barely received it today and had to take it back apart because it's a King size and absolutely does not fit my bed without massive amounts of bar overhang creating a hazard. Also the parts we numbered incorrectly as well so thankfully there are photos you can use to make sure you connect the correct parts together. Another thing I noticed is some of the main bars are cut just a touch too small to fit snug against the brackets that connect so you'll definitely have to make sure your fitting it edge to edge not fit snug.",
