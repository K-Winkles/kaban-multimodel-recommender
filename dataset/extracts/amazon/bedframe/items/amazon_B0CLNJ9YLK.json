Not for jumping around on as it could bend if pouncing or jumping on. I am a senior citizen and I love the foot of bed that is aligned to the mattress level, so my feet are not cramped behind a base. Its even and you can stretch as much as you want. Big and roomy to lay on. Mattress fits well. Low enough for pets to get on bed and high enough for sitting comfortably for a lazy day in bed. Its sturdy, big, great support and fits mattress. Great choice and it really looks good. No regrets.",

It provides excellent support for both the mattress and the sleeper ensuring a comfortable and peaceful night's sleep. The bed frame's noise-free design ensures a peaceful sleeping experience. I no longer have to worry about creaking or squeaking sounds disturbing my restful nights!Hassle-free installation: One of the standout features of this bed frame is its easy assembly. With clear instructions and all the hardware included. I was able to set it up in no time!Style: The design of this bed frame is sleek and modern. It's versatile enough to fit seamlessly into any room, whether it's a minimalist setting or a more eclectic design.Another aspect that impressed me is the thoughtful design for under-bed storage.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I assembled 3 of these",
                "reviewText": "I put together 2 Queen and 1 Full size bed frames. The package was tightly packed, no defects in any of the parts. Each part was in plastic bags, styrofoam kept them in place and additional cardboard was used as protectors. Lots of garbage, but it was optimized to protect the metal parts. Pieces are labeled with numbers and hardware is labeled with letters. As for the hardware, they were all on one card, clearly marked and sealed with hard plastic to not get lost. Downfall was that you need to open the screw sections as you need them or you will end up losing track of which piece was which letter. Perhaps the length of the screw should have been noted right on the card. One extra of each screw/washer/nut with 2 Allen keys. You cannot put this together wrong... holes go all the way through posts so either way it will work. Sister parts are not mirror images when I assumed they would be. There is an indent for the washer, but you won't have it like that on the other side.Directions were so easy to follow. A faster job with 2 people but absolutely doable with one. I completed on my own and I'd say my skill is a 7 out of 10. The first took me about 3 hours and the last about 2. Each step is clearly labeled with numbered parts and lettered hardware. No reading needed, all visual diagrams. The washers are curved and took some thought before putting them on the screw, but after the first wrong one, you'll figure it out quickly.After assembled, very sturdy and fit the mattress appropriately. Someone mentioned it can slide left to right and I do see that as happening, but all platform beds will do that. Since the platform is metal, it slides a little easier.WARNING... assemble with shoes and not bare feet. It is very easy to kick the center support beam and stub you toe; My crocs were perfect for the job.",

Nothing fancy. It took me less then an hour and half to assemble. Instructions are clear and parts labeled correctly and clearly. I would recommend that you only get it if your mattress is 6 inches or less. I have an 8 in pillow top and it swollows the frame up. It fits and looks good and is sturdy. I can barely see my headboard with the mattress I have. Overall you get what you pay for and it\u2019s a good starter bed if your moving and on a budget. And just word to the wise if your on the fluffier side ( thickilishes) it\u2019s probably best to spend more for something a little more put together. Again great starter bed. Just not what I was expecting. I give it a 6/10.",
