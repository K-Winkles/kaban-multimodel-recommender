Having the height underneath was more important to me than having a super stable bed.My full size mattress, a regular full size, is too short for this frame.

I appreciate it. Sent me a new unit so I could replace the damaged part on the bed..& attempted to make it easy for me to return the damaged unit as well..Also appreciate that. I have to call back & set up that pickup again..because UPS came before the delivery of new unit & the fix. A little inconvenient that it took 4 days to receive..but at least doing their best at Amazon trying to help me get this resolved thus far. I also appreciate. However, w/ being a first time ordered myself from Amazon..just not liking all the damage products. As I will also have to be contacting them on the memory foam gel mattress I ordered for this bed as well is a damaged unit too. It\u2019s suppose to be a 10\u201d mattresses & as of 3pm today..the 48 hrs on the mattresses inflate time will be up..& at best the mattress is 9 1/4\u201d some places & worst 8 1/2 inches others.So I am very dismayed at this. It\u2019s taken 2 weeks to try & get a working spare room & bed frame..If I had just went to a couple stores & bought these items. It would have been over & done a week ago. And now I will have to hope I get the same great service about the mattress..& wait for that again..& hope & pray the new one they will send to replace will be what it\u2019s suppose to be at 10\u201d...& quality to follow.For now I will upgrade my review to 3\u2b50\ufe0fs..instead of 2. I am hoping over time w/ next update after using the frame..I can raise those stars more..because I do like this bed frame.Thanks.This bed frame is easy to set up & put together & directions easy to follow. So to replace the new part out was an inconvenience..but easy enough to do..since I put the frame together, w/ only minor help from my daughter.I will up date this as time follows...as I haven\u2019t used the bed yet. So to be able to tell you how great, sturdy the quality of frame is..l cannot tell you that at this pint. What I can tell you is that the construction of frame seems very sturdy & strong..as does the way they have constructed all the extra support beams, slats & legs to hold it. And if you are looking for a bed w/ ample storage space underneath....you will definitely get that w/ this frame...even for larger/taller totes. That I love. The frame is just simple & elegant..not an eye catcher..but very nice if your into simplicity w/ design.I bought this frame along w/ a new gel foam mattress off Amazon. I heard of a lot of other people placing orders for stuff w/ Amazon & thought I would give it a try. I don\u2019t really care for all this shopping on line. I\u2019d much rather go to the stores work face to face w/ real people..plus..don\u2019t really like putting my info out on the web.Anyway, I heard they had some decent prices on a couple things our household needed & I had a very tight budget to work w/ & friend suggested I ck it out. After doing plenty of research I settled on a particular mattress & then this HAAGEEP bed frame..because of the reviews but also the 1609 lb capacity the frame states to have. Not that we are big people..we\u2019re not. But if you read some of the weight limits & problems of reviews on others..they have next to know weight limits. This is for spare room, but still I want to get my moneys worth..even if the price is more than reasonable.Anyway..putting the frame together so far seemed to be a breeze as it arrived yesterday the 23rd of Jan. 2020..my daughter helped just by holding & supporting a few things. However; as we got to the part to put the middle support beam on...before we would start laying all the 8 metal slats across the frame..She said Mom...look at this.... I turned & couldn't believe my eyes...specially...because defects such as this..aren\u2019t suppose to make it out of the factory where production begun. The inspectors job at the factory\u2019s which is to inspect all pieces..prior to packing or shipping..should have caught this oversight way before it shipped out to people or stores.,for any & all such defects.So the piece labeled G for this product which goes for the right hand side of the bed when facing headboard..& is the bedrail that secures the headboard to the footboard on that side..has half of the metal catch hooks that hold the metal planks for support welded to them right side up the way they should be..& unfortunately...the other half of those are welded upside down..wouldn\u2019t be able to hold a slat much less the peanut butter sandwich I just ate.Everything was going great on this bed & the other side of the bed too..up until that point. I just sat & looked in aww...thinking...\u2019You\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me\u2019 & how did that get past inspection at the factory....So anyway..I did just purchase the item...I will be calling customer service..We will see how that goes..hopefully..Lord willing..they will just over night me that part..I don\u2019t want to have to take complete bed down. This bed frame does have a protective warranty from defects..etc..another positive reason I chose it..beside the weight capacity stated, the underneath space, the plain yet..simple elegance to its style & function..was the warranty too. And frankly you cannot get any more defective than that...lol...So I will be updating on this over time. At this put I cannot give you a complete satisfactory, thumbs up or endorse the product just yet..but hopefully that will change.Thank you..Sherry H.",
