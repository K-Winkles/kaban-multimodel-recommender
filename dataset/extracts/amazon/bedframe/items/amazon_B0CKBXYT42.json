                "reviewText": "This was very easy to put together and seems pretty sturdy so far (I've had it less than a week). The problem is that there is no lip, so my new mattress slides around on it. When I make the bed or even knock into it while walking by, the mattress slides over. The mattress is a 14.5\", plush hybrid that weighed 112 lbs when it arrived, so it's not light and shouldn't move that easily. I wish there was a lip on the bed frame or at least something sticky or rough so that the mattress doesn't slide so easily on it.",
