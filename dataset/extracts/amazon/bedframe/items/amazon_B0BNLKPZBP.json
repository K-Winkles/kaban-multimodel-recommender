                "reviewText": "Like most people I was hesitant to buy a bed off Amazon, especially one I would have to put together. Would it be quality? Would it be a pain?I did some research and the reviews of this bed were really good so I took a chance. So glad I did.There are some important notes I'd like to make.. one the color is not really off white. If I had to guess it's a very, very pale grey color but still very pretty. Two...it says 30 minutes to put together...not quite but close. It took about 45 minutes mainly due to some of the parts not being labeled but the instructions are easy to follow. Third some of the wood was rough and I almost got a few splinters but a little sanding later all good.The bolts used are super thick and seem sturdy. The tool that comes with it is next level. No awkward Allen wrench with this bed. Once the frame is in place it seems super sturdy. The metal felt light and I was nervous but once assembled it was strong. The headboard was tricky to attach but not horrible. I'm sure if I didn't assemble it alone it would have gone faster but all in all not bad.There was a slight creaking sound but I'm not entirely sure it's the bed...could be the new mattress. Only time will tell. If it is the bed it's possibly the slats making the sound. I screwed the bolts in so tight there is no way I can loosen them.For a bed frame off of Amazon this seems to be a good one. Long term I'm not sure it will or can hold up but only time will tellIf you want something inexpensive that is sturdy, easy to assemble and looks good then definitely get this bed.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly was straight forward. The instructions are lacking in clarity and detail. Still, it\u2019s fairly easy to assemble. Everything needed is packed INSIDE the back of the headboard. That is VERY SMART DESIGN and much appreciated by me.This is a rock solid bed. No issues with that. But, please don\u2019t confuse it with \u201clux\u201d\u2026. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s perfect for a guest room or a dorm or \u2026.. but don\u2019t think that it is a \u201clux\u201d bed. Functionally is amazing. Fabric, design and details that would make this \u201clux\u201d are missing. Value for the money is OUTSTANDING. It\u2019s utterly perfect for our guest room. I would not want this in our primary bedroom though.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the gray Molblly Bed Frame (King) with Adjustable Headboard and I am very happy with my purchase. One month in and the bed frame seems to be very sturdy and durable, and the adjustable headboard is an absolute fantastic feature that allows me to comfortably sit up in bed to read, watch TV, or simply relax.The assembly process was also very easy and straightforward, which was a nice surprise. I will dock a star as the hook and loop (Velcro) strips on one of the two slat pieces were twisted and stapled which did not allow the slats to rest completely flat, but the weight of the mattress should make it a moot point.Overall, I would highly recommend this bed frame to anyone in the market for a new frame.",
