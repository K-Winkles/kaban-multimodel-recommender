                "reviewText": "In a word, this bed frame system is AMAZING!We\u2019ve been using ours for over a month now and I can say that this is by far the sturdiest frame I\u2019ve ever seen or owned. A peeve of mine has always been bed frames that aren\u2019t adequately supported - that creak and groan with shifting weight and that just don\u2019t feel at all supportive. This would be the polar opposite. It has 12 supportive legs and even without the weight of a mattress it feels rock solidly strong. Once the mattress is in place you just know that this is something that will last and provide your mattress with the support it needs.A real bonus for this frame set are the two 110vac plugs and the two USB plugs. That makes it super easy to plug in your electronics and keep on the built in shelf.I absolutely recommend this bed frame system and am extremely pleased with this purchase.FYI, in case you need a mattress recommendation, we paired this frame with a Molblly King Size Firm Mattress, 12 Inch Hybrid Mattress in a Box with Gel Memory Foam (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C68FNY3B)",
