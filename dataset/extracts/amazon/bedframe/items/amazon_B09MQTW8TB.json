                "reviewText": "I bought this for a guest room. I was initially somewhat skeptical based on the price (5 stars for affordability), but I figured I'd take a risk because it was, after all, for a guest room. I was pleasantly surprised. It is VERY sturdy. Let's walk through unboxing, assembly, and my finished assessment.Unboxing: everything came well packaged, yet with minimal styrofoam waste. No damaged pieces. Impressed so far!Assembly: Took me about 2 hours using the included tools and watching a Hallmark movie. Might have gone a little faster had I used power tools. Instructions were easy to read and clear. Parts were clearly labeled.The screws/bolts/nuts were in labeled blisterpacks. A few extras were included just in case, although I didnt need them. Holes were drilled out correctly. I had no trouble putting pieces together. It went together smoothly. I did a final tightening of everything and snugged it all up.Stability/Sturdiness: Admittedly, I was initially a bit skeptical. The frame gets progressively more sturdy as it comes together, I promise. I was also concerned the round mattress rails seemed narrow, however, my concerns were unfounded. I put a 12 inch memory foam mattress (also purchased here on Amazon) right on top of the frame. It fit snugly between the head and foot rails, so it doesn't shift around (win!). I can't feel the rails through the mattress; no lumps or hard spots (win!). There are no squeaks or wobble in the frame. It is STURDY (double win!)Final assessment: I have no complaints with this product. It was extremely affordable. It's sturdy. It's attractive. Very pleased with this purchase! I know I mentioned using this in a guest room, but I would have no reservations purchasing another for everyday use. Great value for your money!",

I did use my own tools which I preferred to the ones provided. (Allen wrench and a crescent) Instructions were straightforward and easy to follow. I had watched the video before purchasing but didn't need to view during assembly. I bought the bronze and it looks much like the picture. This bed looks beautiful. I think this style is very versatile and would work well with farmhouse, boho, shabby chic, rustic, western, or eclectic decor. Legends never die. Happy customer-me .",

However, we treated ourself to a California king mattress and this frame was too good of a deal to pass up. Very cute. Took about 2 hours for me to put together. Relatively simple, except when you have to use the Alan to turn the screw and the other tool just to hold the nut in place. Maybe there is a better way, but it was the quickest way for me to tighten the screw. This is only my second time putting together furniture, first time bedframe, and I managed pretty well. The metal seems great quality, as well. As sturdy as if it was one piece. Lots of space underneath too. Remember that it is just coated antique gold so be gentle when assembling.",

You can put it together alone or with someone else but someone else obviously obviously makes it a lot easier and quicker. It\u2019s extremely sturdy and I love the fact that the metal bar slats are very close together so it doesn\u2019t make my memory foam mattress sag on the bottom in between the slats. The end result looks beautiful, and I love the fact that, even though it\u2019s a queen size it takes up so much less space in my room than my previous bed! Definitely recommend! Took me about 45 minutes to put together and everything is neatly packed with very clear detailed instructions",
