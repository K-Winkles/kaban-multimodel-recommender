Its very sturdy with actual pine boards for the supports, easy to put together and doesnt require a drill at all because of the soft pine used. Was able to attach my existing headboard to it as well without too much effort. The finish is that fake wood vinyl, but it looks really nice and you really cant tell once a bed is on it, and even then they bothered to wrap the rounded edges of it so its a nice looking piece. Totally silent. Considering how cheap this was + free shipping with prime, its a great value and seems like it will hold up for a long time.",

Just be sure to not over-tighten and strip anything! Also be sure to use the large number of screws required for the slats. They add significant and important stability overall. This bed frame should last a very long while.",

                "reviewText": "it took me forever to find a bed frame that I liked and I'm happy with this one. it was very easy to assemble. it's a nice color and it does not make any creaking noises while you're on it. the only kind of issues I have with it aren't issues really, it's just more of a slight inconvenience. the wooden pieces that keep that mattress up, they are close to the top of the frame. this means that the mattress doesn't have much of a border to stop it from easily sliding off. also, I got a full sized frame, and it is slightly bigger than my mattress. so you can still see the wood beneath the mattress and it looks kind of odd. but overall it's good, it does the job.",

                "reviewText": "Like the classic design, nothing sticks out to bump into or protrude. Only issue I had with my order was one of the four legs did not have all the holes drilled into it, so I couldn't put it together. I did notify the company, but went ahead and drilled the holes myself matching it up with the other legs so I didn't have to wait for a replacement. Because I needed a bed! Didn't want to sleep on the floor waiting for a new leg to arrive. Other than that, it was simple to put together and appears to be sturdy. I would prefer to have a metal center support. But overall it has worked fine since I put it up.",

So I purchased this bed and paired it with this headboard, Atlantic Furniture R-181834 Headboard, Full, Walnut. Almost perfect match. You need to drill to attach the headboard, fyi. But they line up beautifully. The bed is modern but warm, solid, I paired it with 14 inch memory foam mattress. You do not feel like you are sitting any lower than a standard box spring and mattress. The side tables are 26.5 inches high for comparison. There are center legs for support, but no side center legs to take out your toes in a small room. I can\u2019t capture the wood color in a photo, it is a very neutral walnut brown with a TINY auburn. This is not cherry, nor mahogany colored. I thought it was easy to put together, straight side of legs to the outside. For the price, I could not have done better!",
