                "reviewText": "I was excited to get an inexpensive frame that looked sturdy. It was a little trying to get together due to some parts being pretty tight but it\u2019s manageable. However, the middle legs are all bent after less than 8 months of use. It\u2019s now in the dump. I tried contacting the company who supposedly sells this because it says to check them for warranty info but I can\u2019t find any form of contact. I left a review for them to see but received no reply or acknowledgment. Waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly was mostly fairly simple until I got to the slats. We had to twist them slightly to get them in. Unsure if this is on purpose or ours was slightly off. If you don't have a lot of upper arm strength, this would be really difficult. Now that it is put together, it has a about 1/2 inch of a wiggle to it but all the screws seem locked in tight. Overall, it seems to be holding up, but it is a little less sturdy than I had hoped. The whole bed moves when I roll over in bed.",
