It was much easier to put together than I had anticipated, it came with all of the tools needed however the slats might need bolted down\u2014they\u2019re just attached with Velcro which would be fine if the bed weren\u2019t for a naughty 3 year old boy (I can see the slats becoming a baseball bat). They\u2019re made of wood, as is the support it rests on so it wouldn\u2019t be hard to make a more permanent attachment. The fabric is beautiful, we chose the blue one, it\u2019s soft and velvetty and a beautiful vibrant color. It\u2019s quite sturdy and strong, I\u2019m impressed because I expected it to be a little less strong for $99. We love it! My son is upgrading from a rickety old metal bed frame that squeaked and rattled and swung around when you sat down on it, screws falling out and ready for retirement. We\u2019re pleased with this purchase. One thing I would say it measure your mattress and make sure it will fit, ours is fine but it was a tight squeeze. I\u2019ll post a picture later",
