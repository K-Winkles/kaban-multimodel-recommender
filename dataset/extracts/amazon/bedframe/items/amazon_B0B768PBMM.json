                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy - extra supportive with metal slats (no box-spring needed)",
                "reviewText": "This is a great bed that doesn't require box spring. It comes in reasonably small box that can fit in the backseat of the car. You will need to do full assembly which is not hard but I suggest not to tighten up the screws right away. Install everything then go back and tighten all the screws. The setup has a high-quality metal frame and steel bars that can hold much weight without losing shape or collapsing. In addition to symmetrically aligned slat spacers, rubber strips are pressed between the slats that prevent regular creaking of the bed while shifting weight over them or during movement.The metal frame is finished with anti-rust paint to ensure its longer life. Optimum under-bed space facilitates storage options and adds to its user-friendliness. The rustic style of the frame makes it suitable for all kinds of homes. Ample space underneath the bed is great for storage bins and such. We needed a bedframe for our guestroom to accommodate guests and friends of my kids during their overnight stays. We opted for this one because of its simple design and rustic appeal that went with other furniture in the room. It was easy to install and even provided ample bottom storage space where I could store the curtains and bathroom linen. We are extremely satisfied with the bedframe. Highly recommended!",

My husband and i have laid on it at the same time with both of our toddlers and its held up! One important thing, the bed doesn't squeak! The only \u201chard\u201d part is building it because you actually have to follow the booklet instructions and they're not very good but with a little patience its doable.",

                "reviewText": "If you're on a tight budget and need a bedframe quickly, this isn't a bad choice. It's fairly sturdy, doesn't creek, and from what I can tell, won't damage (tear, cut, or poke holes in) your mattress (from sharp edges or bad welds). That being said, you should take care not to strip the bolt heads - that will leave sharp burrs that will probably tear into your mattress and sheets.If you're assembling this by yourself, follow my tips in the photos I included. You'll find it much easier than the way the instructions direct you. Also, as another savy reviewer mentioned, leave all the bolts somewhat loose until you have everything in-place. Some parts may not fit until you go back and loosen a bunch of other parts.I prefer solid oak furniture, but in a pinch (and on a tight budget) , I feel I got a good value for what I paid and will recommend this product to friends.Some other reviewers seem to have received bent and damaged versions of this product. Thankfully this wasn't the case with mine. Since this bedframe is all steel, it's pretty darn heavy. It wouldn't surprise me if a lazy or careless delivery driver dropped, or otherwise mishandled the package leading to bent parts. I was lucky enough to not have had that happen.Lastly, something only (one other reviewer) accurately pointed out, the under-bed clearance (for storage) is 10 and 1/4 inches! NOT the 11 inches the description claims! Also, if you're buying one of those under-bed rolling drawr type, wire basket, storage things, and you want one that fits almost exactly under the 10&1/4 inches, you only have 19&3/4 inches of clearance until you hit the middle of the bedframe center support which drops down to 9 inches. Bare that in mind if you want something that slides deeper under the bed.One last and only minor flaw, the center leg on the rail, between headboard and footboard, is flush with the rail, making you prone to painfully stubbing your toes on it! I did it twice so far. It should have been designed (inset) or further under the bed to prevent such an incident. Oh well, for this low price, you can't expect everything.For the most part, I'm happy with this bedframe and would recommend it to others.",

We live the underbed storage, on lu thing to gwt used to is the pullout drawers are not on a track and easily tip. Consider adding a weight to the back to balance them. The headboard is really nice to add night light and place for trinket display. We are considering adding some fun lights to the bed which will be easy to hide under shelving.This bed is also great for growth as it seems pretty timeless in design.",
