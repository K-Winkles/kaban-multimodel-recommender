                "reviewText": "Overall, I really liked this product! I feel what you get for the price is very reasonable. The assembly wasn\u2019t too complicated, took me around 45 minutes. Just be sure to pay attention to the details in the pictures. I wanted something nice and for a reasonable price and this exceeded my expectations. I have a 12\u201d mattress on it so I set the head board in the middle level, it leaves just enough space to slip your hand to put on your sheets and at the same time doesn\u2019t leave a huge gap. Depending on your mattress you can adjust it. Again overall great product I\u2019m satisfied!",

                "reviewText": "Queen size frame had no missing pieces or hardware, with easy to follow instructions. Took about 40 mins to assemble going slow, no tools required. Dark gray upholstery looks nice and is sturdy so far with no squeaks or rattles. Issues were one of the holes was off center & the intended screw couldn't quite reach it. I had to use a good amount of force to bend the wooden plank in order for the screw to reach. Would've been easier with two people. Other issue was a strong smell coming from the fabric that took several days before it began fading. Overall good value & will likely last a long time in our sparingly used guest room.",
