I purchased it for my college student's fraternity bedroom and we just attempted to put this together. The washers do not match up with the screws for tightness. The quality of this frame is so poor. Unfortunately, I discard the box so I can NOT return it.. So the next best thing was... I Threw the Frame in the Dumpster and purchased another frame elsewhere. Again, Please Do Not Waste your MONEY! Look elsewhere. I have never written a REVIEW on Amazon before, For either Good or Bad purposes... However, I feel so strongly about this quality.. I needed too!",

I assembled this with ease by myself; however, it would be a lot quicker and easier if there were two people.One thing I found unusual was that not all the legs touch the ground when the entire is assembled. However, when you put your mattress on it or any weight on it, it presses those legs to the ground. IIt was particular the middle leg that is slightly lifted from the ground. Despite this flaw, it is a very study frame. Just make sure to tighten all the screws and bolts!To give you an idea of how much storage there is under this frame, I was able to fit 1 medium suitcase and 8 storage bags packed with clothes yet still have room to spare for more storage.Overall, this is a great bedframe that's affordable and offers a ton of storage!",
