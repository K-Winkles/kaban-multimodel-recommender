                "reviewText": "What a fantastic product! First of all, it\u2019s very reasonably priced for a california king platform bed frame, which is very hard to find. It shipped in a timely manner. It was extremely easy to put together! The tools included were EXCELLENT - two regular Allen wrenches, AND a ratcheting Allen wrench! Which was fantastic! I used it for the entire assembly, which took maybe 30 minutes by myself.The entire thing is solid metal, it\u2019s VERY sturdy.Then they have all the relevant parts lined with foam so there\u2019s ZERO, absolutely NO squeaking, grinding, nothing, no noise whatsoever. I have literally never in my life had a bed frame that didn\u2019t at least creak a little, until this one. It\u2019s such a simple thing and yet I\u2019ve never seen another bed frame, for this kind of low price, have that feature.The slats are close together so you don\u2019t have to worry about your fancy mattress warranty being voided, or sagging, by lacking support. They\u2019re also wide, and come on a roll of Velcro, so that they don\u2019t move once they\u2019re in place, and which also keeps them silent. The manufacturing is perfect - the velcro roll with the slats is precisely the same size as the corresponding strip on the sides of the frame, so if you line it up correctly at one end, it\u2019s perfect on the other end. AND, two rows of slats have non-slip adhesive, so that once your mattress is in place, it won\u2019t slide anywhere. Again - something that is so simple, yet I have never seen such a genius feature on another bed frame.I am so beyond impressed with this bed frame. It\u2019s high quality in materials, in manufacturing, and in design. And within the design, they made it look great, with smooth flawless material, and easy to assemble. Everything is perfectly labeled, the instructions were clear and complete, and the small parts and tools come in a vac-packed kit so that nothing can go missing in transit or be left out during packing.Some other features include plastic feet so that it doesn\u2019t scratch delicate floors, but will also slide over carpet nicely if you need to move it; and pre-drilled holes in the headboard-end of the frame to attach a headboard if you want to.This simply has everything:-great price-great design-great craftsmanshipThey thought of everything and kept the price reasonable. I can\u2019t think of a single thing I\u2019d change or add. I\u2019m so glad I picked this frame.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent frame! My wife and I took about 30 minutes to put this together and cut down/throw away all the cardboard boxes, plastic wrap, and foam at approx 2 am in the morning. We were tired after a long day and this is what we did last. This frame is not made cheap. It is far more sturdy then I expected. I'm a 250 lb man and my wife is about 150 lbs and this frame can hold our bed and us with ease. We ordered the queen size because our previous King was more bed than we needed. The key to successfully putting this together is to not tighten down any screw until the end. Hand tighten them all to about 1/8\" from touching their heads on the metal rail. You will need to push and pull a bit to get some of the final holes lined up but as long as one of you has some muscle it shouldn't be too difficult. My wife isn't mechanically inclined but I am very mechanical. We had a breeze putting this together. Btw, check the velcro before assembling the pieces so that none of it falls off during assembly. We had a few pieces of velcro on the side rails that was still VERY tacky but was loose. We just lined up the velcro on its rail and pressed it down hard and ran our fingers up and down the rail a few times to make sure the velcro was tight to the rail this time. Fixed the velcro very easy. The hardware and tools that come with this frame are very few. I was surprised at how easy it was all to put together. The entire assembly comes with 15 bolts and 2 wing nuts and 2 matching Allen wrenches. By the time you get the outer assembly together, half the hardware is gone because each inside corner takes 2 of the bolts. Every rail was made very well. There was some light scratches here and there and I could see a little bare metal on the outside corners but it's a black frame that will never be seen once the outer wooden frame (found, built and/or sold separately) is placed around the frame anyhow. Also, note that the metal slats have plastic end caps that may need to be pushed in a little to be tight. If a cap is sticking out a little bit then the slat won't fit into the frame. I used my palm to tap them down tight and then the slats fit snuggly. Position your slats centered or the gap on each end won't be even and that will also change the load of the weight on the slats. Truly though this frame is so well built that an inch here or there is very unlikely to make a difference. Included are our pictures because we wanted to help others make an informed decision. The single issue we have with this frame is that there is no recess on the edges of the frame for your box spring or mattress to sit inside so the mattress or boxspring could slide around a bit. We knew this going into this purchase and we already knew we were going to build a wooden frame (with drawers built into the bottom under the frame) on the outside of this frame that would provide that lip we wanted. The wooden frame will look sharp and provides under frame storage. Just ordered a headboard for this and it will be delivered in about a week. I'll try to get back to this review and update pics. God Bless.",

                "reviewText": "I needed this bedframe to replace my old bed until I move out to a bigger place in the next year, so obviously I was looking for a cheap option because I'm not going to keep it for long. But I'm actually very impressed with the quality and sturdiness, especially for how cheap this was. I almost expected it to be wobbly and squeaky, you know. But it's the complete opposite. I'm so happy with this bed.Pros: -SUPER EASY to assemble! Took less than 15 minutes for two people and we went slowly-Sturdy-Zero squeaks-It still folds in the middle after assembling it, which makes it so easy to turn around in a narrow room. It probably doesn't fold completely but it's enough to make it narrower when needed during transport-Nice minimalist design that doesn't take unnecessary extra space in a small bedroom-The cute little drive ratchet tool they give you is a plus-Very light and easy to move aroundCons:-None that I can think of",

Got rid of the box springs and layed the mattress directly on this new frame. Solid! Super easy to setup.",
