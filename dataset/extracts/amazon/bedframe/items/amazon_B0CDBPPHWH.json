                "reviewText": "I thought I would add a couple comments to the original review that a buyer might aopreciate. I like this bed but it is not a substantial bed in headboard height, thickness or in weight. If you are looking for a grand headboard with a lofty thick appearance, this is not it. This is great for the lower price it is offered for. This is smaller in scope but soft and pleasant to look at. The height of my mattress is 24\u201d which is perfect for me. I did not want to store anything under the bed, which is 8\u201d off the floor. That is what I wanted to add.It was time consuming to put together but I watched a YouTube video of a similar bed assembly and that helped a lot. I like the pink color but it leans toward rose. The frame has lots of bolts but put some music on and follow each picture in the manual. It\u2019s easy to put together. You will only need the Allen wrench that comes in the box. The frame seems very sturdy. The wood slats are 4.5 inches apart.I bought this frame because it\u2019s closer to the floor than my old bed. I love the height. My old bed was over 30\u201d off the floor and harder to climb into. This one is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "After receiving my bed I was intimidated by how heavy it was and honestly contemplated returning it due to me thinking it would be hard to assemble alone. After reading through the reviews I was encouraged by the ones that stated it was a quick job. I\u2019m actually embarrassed to say this but since it\u2019s anonymous, why not? Haha I started at 8:30pm and was done around 11:15 I am not quite sure how some people were able to put this together in an hour or less. I have a king size so I\u2019m telling myself that was the reason for the extra time. I\u2019m currently laying down proud of myself for actually doing it alone.I love the look of the bed, it\u2019s very soft and the velvet was exactly what I wanted. I also love the fact that you only need one tool to put it together and it\u2019s included.The only cons I have so far are I feel there should be more wording in the instructions instead of just pictures and labels. I second guess myself a lot and spent most of the time double checking the pictures to make sure I was putting things in the right place.Also at the end when it\u2019s time to put the side pieces on the headboard my back started to ache due to having to hold the rest of the bed a certain way while doing it. Other than that so far so good. I haven\u2019t experienced any wobbling at all.",

I will say this was fairly easy to put together I didn\u2019t use the tools provided had a drill for this and a certain drill bit for the screws it honestly went by smoother and did it by myself. I will say it\u2019s much more sturdier than the previous bed I had, if you\u2019re thinking about getting it I say go for it I\u2019m glad I did. Also I would also like to add the Velcro was a nice touch instead of screwing the slats in very pretty and I love itPS the mattress is from Amazon if anyone was wondering very comfortable! \ud83e\ude77",
