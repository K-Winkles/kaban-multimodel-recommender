                "reviewText": "So my kiddos were tired of bunk beds so I ordered 2 of these. They came within 3 days and no issues. Putting the bed together was fairly simple and finished putting it together within two hours. The frame is very sturdy and my kiddos are very happy. I thought the tan/white cloth on head board might look cheap but it doesnt at all, very pretty in person! Definitely a cute twin size bed for the price (twin fits both of my older children with plenty of room to grow). I would recommend! Only tip is to prepare for the space between frame and headboard, possibly order a thick mattress or add a topper to help with the space or even a quick idea is a thick body pillow. I would say atleast get a mattress with 8 or 12 and youll be good.",

The only possible complaint is that the plug to make the electric chargers work is very short - unless you happen to have an outlet right by where you intend to put the headboard (as in on the same wall right next to or behind it).Would recommend and would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is strong, functional and looks great! I recently upgraded from a Queen mattress to a KING. So I needed a new frame. Because of the larger bed, I no longer had room on the sides for a nightstand. This frame provided the perfect solution. A nice built in shelf on the headboard. A shelf that includes 2 power outlets and 2 USB ports! Talk about functional! This is the only bed frame I've ever owned that was useful for more than just sleeping on. The headboard shelf is actually my favorite part. It's just the right height to not cover up my wall switch and fits perfect where I had my old bed. The headboard shelf takes place of my old nightstand. So it's incredibly useful!!! The frame doesn't squeak either. It seems very strong. This bed frame is top quality! Look great and simply IS great! BUY BUY BUY!!!",

                "reviewText": "You could spend a whole lot more on a bed frame and still not come close to the quality of this one. I was very impressed with the overall fit and finish of this frame. All the parts aligned properly for assembly, were well identified and the instructions were easy to follow. The structural materials were heavy duty and will undoubtedly hold more than the design weight. I had this fully assembled and in position in about an hour and a half. The instructions state to keep the assembly screws loose until all the parts are in place, then tighten them down...follow that advice and assembly will be a breeze. The dual 120VAC power outlet combined with the two USB outlets make this bed frame a clear winner that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",

                "reviewText": "I don't leave hardly any reviews on Amazon, but I felt I had to review this one because I was really impressed by the quality of this bed frame. I think most of us have received some sort of 'assembly required' items, and usually I'm less than impressed with the instructions, fit and finish, durability, etc. I had the opposite experience with this bed frame. The frame itself is VERY solid once together. The materials and welds on the metal were solid. The instructions were easy to follow and all you need is the provided allen wrench. It took awhile to unwrap/unbox, but once I laid everything out, I had this all assembled in about 30-40 minutes. After throwing my bed down (king size), I was very happy with the height of the frame and just how sturdy and quiet it is. Highly recommend, great product for the price in my opinion.",
