There were some parts of the frame where I was questioning the price compared to the quality, like the headboard \u201cwood\u201d is sort of flimsy. The metal is ok quality and sturdy though. My bed is an extra large and extremely heavy and I was worried it would mess with the base when I added my weight as well. It\u2019s slightly squeaky & the metal on the base is kinda uneven though, so when someone lays on the bed, it kinda makes a metal clanging sound. The drawers are annoying to use and are a lot smaller than I expected. They aren\u2019t actually attached to the bed and are held onto it with a screw and a hole. If you don\u2019t position the screw correctly, you\u2019re stuck fidgeting with the drawer for a bit, since once the bedding is on, it\u2019s hard to see where the hole on the \u201cwood\u201d of the drawer is.Overall, it\u2019s a decent bed frame.",

                "reviewText": "The bed frame is sturdy and made from full metal (including cross beams). The package includes spare parts (wow!) and all of the parts needed to build the bed were included. There is foam strip included in the kit to limit the metal on metal squeaks - there are no squeaks from this bed frame. The package does weigh about 110lbs, so make sure you have a friend available to help you move it.Assembly took about 2 hours and the instructions were thorough. Assembly was easy with my only gripe being 4-5 screws that did not have pre-drilled holes in to the laminate wood. The only 2 screws that you MUST install are the ones to screw the outlet to the shelf on the headboard. Again, difficult but not terrible, which is why I gave ease of install a 4/5. The manufacturer could pre-drill the holes or at least put divots in to make installation of the screws easier.The below bed drawers are pretty cheap and do not ride on a track system (see picture). It will work for what I want to use it for but be warned. The drawers clip in to the bed frame to keep them flush with the bed. The top slide out drawers will be blocked by nightstands, if you have any.The LED strip is programmable and can light up in many different colors or has programmable modes, including one that reacts to sound.I hopefully won't need to buy another bed frame for a long time, but I would buy this again.",

He immediately emptied his bureau and filled the drawers with his clothes. he loved that he could charge his phone in the charging port in th ehead boards. Looks great.Wished the side of the headboard also had the wood veneer but otherwise looks great.Assembly takes a bit of time ( a few hours) so be prepared.",
