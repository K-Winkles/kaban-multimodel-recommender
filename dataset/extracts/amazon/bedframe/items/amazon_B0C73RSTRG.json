                "reviewText": "I rec'd the king size bed frame with headboard to go along with my Novilla mattress which I had bought a few months ago. Needless to say, they both fit like a hand & glove. There is absolutely no noise with the wood slats supporting the mattress and it's particularly nice to not have to add a box spring. The comfort is certainly the main feature here and my mattress ensures that. The bed frame is very sturdy and has plenty of room to store odds/ends under the 12\" clearance. I don't normally want things stored under my bed but it's still nice to know that it's there if you need it for storage. The frame looks especially rich in color and style. It dresses up the bed and looks so nice in the overall scheme. I am so happy with the purchase and will definitely recommend the bed frame...and yes...the mattress as well, to all my friends and family. I'm still excited to showcase the fine details that I believe add to the beauty of the frame. The price is right and the product came in 2 days earlier than expected with no problems putting it all together. Good instructions are necessary and this was no exception. Thank you Novilla for the quality of your product.",

                "reviewText": "The bed frame is super sturdy once properly assembled, the central leg also gives more balance and stability.It comes with well-packed necessary accessories and tools, they look very simple and not complicated at all compared to other bed frames I've bought.It can be easily assembled with the included tools by following the assembly instructions and everything is clearly labeled. Also, if you have an electric screwdriver, will save you time and effort.The wooden slats are very sturdy too, and they sit on the frame snugly. I just put the mattress directly on the wooden slats with no problems.Overall, this is a nice affordable bed frame with a classic look.",
