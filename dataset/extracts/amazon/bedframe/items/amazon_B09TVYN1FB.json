Was impressed with how well all parts are labeled. Directions were very clear and had no problem putting bed together with no help (most difficult was the last step putting the support slats in, but was fine once you get the hang of it). When completed bed is very stable and solid. I am very impressed with this product from packaging, shipping, stability and looks. Really surprised at quality for the price. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the fact I haven't had the chance use it for real. Will follow up later and report if my initial review supports my initial findings. Initial impression: greater value than I expected.",

We were looking for a new bed for our rental cabin that would not break the bank, but still look nice. Assembly was surprisingly quite easy! The bed us super sturdy, no squeaks, and seems to be just what we wanted. Very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, nice looking bed. Easy to assemble. Seems very sturdy.Cons: One of the pieces was manufactured in correctly (attached picture). There was suppose to be a whole but didn't have one. Not a major issue. Bed seems pretty sturdy without it.Also, the three legs thar goes in the middle of the bed were not the same size so one of the legs was actually shorter than the rest and doesn't touch the floor.Someone mentioned the bed doesn't slide. I disagree. But also, my bed is just on vinyl floor no carpet or anything.Lastly - the bed SQUEAKS like no other. Everytime I get on and off the bed it squeaks. If I turn over, it squeaks. If anyone has a solution to this please let me know!!",
