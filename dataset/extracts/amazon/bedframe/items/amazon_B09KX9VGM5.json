                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t say enough good things about this headboard. Looks great, feels great, a breeze to assemble (compared to other assembly-required furniture)\u2026But there\u2019s something I haven\u2019t seen any reviews mention: the packaging. This included foam and styrofoam blocks to help keep everything secure. And the styrofoam was sealed in plastic to prevent that obnoxious flaking you always get with \u201cloose\u201d styrofoam blocks. You\u2019re forever vacuuming and picking those little white balls off everything. But not with this bed.I know it seems melodramatic to spend more characters on this than the bed itself, but it really does speak to the priorities of this manufacturer. It\u2019s not a chintzy brand that will pack the styrofoam packing in its own protective packaging. And yet this bed was more than affordable.Back to the bed. It feels very sturdy, and although the headboard is light and not a solid hunk of wood, it doesn\u2019t feel \u201ccheap\u201d like more lackluster reviews have suggested.I love that the headboard\u2019s height is adjustable, meaning that while I\u2019m still using my thinner 8\u201d mattress, I can use the higher option for the headboard and throw my box springs under my mattress. In a year or so when I upgrade my mattress to a thicker 10-12\u201d masterpiece, I\u2019ll remove the box springs and lower the headboard.My roommate and I put this together in about 20 minutes. If I\u2019d been at it alone, it would\u2019ve taken us me about an hour (don\u2019t judge).Impressive bed, impressive packaging, impressive price. Don\u2019t hesitate, just buy.",

Nice packaging and no loose styrofoam flying all over the place as the foam was wrapped in a plastic covering. This bed did not have a weird chemical smell.Highly recommend!",

Not the merchants fault, just FedEx being garbage as usual.The bed frame is really easy to put together and easy to read instructions and all the parts were present (including some extra). I got the beige one and highly recommend putting it together with the plastic on and tearing it off, especially if you have a dog around that sheds.Overall, would recommend for the price",
