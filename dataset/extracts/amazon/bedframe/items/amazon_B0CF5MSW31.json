                "reviewText": "If you are looking for an inexpensive bed frame, I think this is a great option. We got this bed due to the low price point and the natural wood color. The bed itself, once built is pretty low to the ground, which could be fine without a box spring because the support slats are quite strong (unlike other cheap slat supports). Each slat has to be individually attached, though. The headboard is really short. The mattress we put on top is a thicker pillow top queen and once all the pillows are on, the height is pretty much the same as the top of the headboard. The bed also has a smell that needs to air out once the bed is put together. We left the windows open for a few days as a result since we were expecting company.",

The assembly is pretty much fool proof if you read the instructions correctly. I was able to assemble it with a Phillips head screwdriver as my only additional tool! However, having a drill would've been nice for screwing in the slats! The bed frame seems super sturdy and works great with my queen mattress. A great purchase especially for the price!",
