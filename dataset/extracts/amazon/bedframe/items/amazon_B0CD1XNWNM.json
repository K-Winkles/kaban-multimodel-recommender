Also, I did have to sand the unfinished wood because it was very rough and left splinters. The rails have a sharp angle so we had to put a pool noodle on the length of the rail so my kids won't hurt themselves on the sharp edge, would be better if it was rounded. If you're willing to put in some work this bed is nice.",
