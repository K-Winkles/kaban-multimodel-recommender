                "reviewText": "Purchased the full frame. Arrived in 1 day. Shipping box was surprisingly small. Everything but 3 parts were labeled and each part had a matching piece so it was easy to figure out the numbers. All the stickers numbering the parts are hidden when the mattress gets placed. It took me 45 minutes to put it together with the small tools. The bar \u201cslats\u201d have a place for a screw to hold them in but there were no instructions to use screws or hardware included for the final step. The bed is really great for the price and sturdy for everyday use. It probably wouldn\u2019t withstand being jumped on and it will most likely have to be Allen wrench tightened every few months.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived a lot earlier than expected. I was expecting this to be delivered in like 7-10 days, but it was here in like 3 days. Which was great because I needed a better frame with more support for our king mattress. The box was smaller than expected. There were ALOT of pieces, felt like I bought something from IKEA lol. At first, I questioned the quality, I mean it was only $100 for a whole frame with head/foot board. Figured I would get what I paid for. But surprisingly, This frame is impressive. We are bigger people with a 100# dog and it holds all of us without even a squeak. The third bar of support underneath also makes a difference. Very happy and would definitely recommend.",
