If you\u2019re renting and aren\u2019t supposed to have nails, etc in your walls, I recommend putting a different adhesive on the back such as removable mounting tape. That\u2019s not my situation, but in case it\u2019s yours, now you know.Our dogs jump up and play on our bed sometimes and we were annoyed with our headboard shaking up against the wall. We live in on base housing so we didn\u2019t want to risk damage to our walls either. These have definitely stopped most of the shaking! Vigorous movement can sometimes make the headboard lightly \u201cslam\u201d into them, but it really isn\u2019t that noisy or anything!",

These have been well worth the purchase and if anything happens to them, I will buy them again. My only fault with these is the sticky part is supposed to go on the wall. I have seen where some people but the sticky to the headboard instead and wish I had done that for if we ever decide to re-arrange the furniture in the room. Due to how well it works, I'm afraid it will take the paint off the wall when/if they get removed.",

                "reviewText": "My bedframe is a couple inches away from the wall, like most are. BUT whenever the hubbs and I try to \"wrestle\" the bedframe hits the wall, making too much noise. I don't know about you but I'm not trying to wake my kids up so they can walk in on us trying to find out what the banging noise is. That is why we bought these. They were a little tricky to install at first because I was having a blonde moment and tried to put them in one at a time so the first one kept falling when trying to install the second. Only took me two tries before the light bulb went off and I decided to try placing them at the same time. This worked perfectly. They've stayed in placed after many \"wrestling matches\" so I recommend them.",
