I like that it uses metal slates and not wood like the other frames I\u2019ve bought.The only thing I can say is the building process was a little difficult because I did it alone, with another set of hands it would be no problem at all. I was a little disappointed that the lights need to be plugged in and isn\u2019t a part of the plug assembly that powers the outlets, you\u2019ll have to route the light strip yourself.I had no missing parts or damage to the frame, the box was beat up, but it was packaged pretty well.Overall I\u2019m happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The bed is solid and sturdy, and doesn't make much noise when you move around. It's a little low to the ground, but I knew that from the specifications and I don't really mind. There's still enough for sliding storage to fit under the bed.The only complaint I have is the outlet. I like that there is one built into the headboard, but since it's inside the cubby and not on the top there's nowhere for the wires to go but into the bed. It's hard to tuck them out of the way, and I'm constantly laying on wires, yanking things off of the headboard onto my face while I'm sleeping, and pulling on the cords to the point where it damages my chargers. The outlet is also extremely tight and it's hard to get things in and out. I plugged in two chargers and I don't unplug them because I can't be bothered.",
