                "reviewText": "This well-designed, easy to assemble bed frame is made to last for years. We spent quite a long time searching for a queen-sized bed frame that wouldn't have the issues other inexpensive bed frames we've owned which usually is either center support failure or headboard/footboard separation. If you look at the listing, you will see this is made from robust square tube iron. This robustness carries through the entire design of this bed, from the center support to the bed slats; even the fasteners are heavy duty.Aesthetically, this leaves a little to be desired as it lends the piece a more industrial look but not obtrusively so. One does need to keep in mind that inexpensive furniture has to make sacrifices in some areas, in this case the mfr decided to give up a bit on aesthetics in favor of a robust, well-made bed frame.The added electrical and USB outlets is a very helpful feature that is recommended if you like to use your ipad or laptop in bed.The one area of criticism is that the frame itself could have been made 2 inches shorter and 1 inches less wide as a queen sized mattress is a bit smaller than the actual bed frame. If this frame had these dimension it would receive 5 stars. (btw, reducing the size of the frame would result not only in a better product but also in cost savings for the mfr. and shipper.",

I was able to build this within 1 hour by myself. The headboard has a stylish grey cotton with wooden design. The center support of the bed frame is made out of metal unlike others use wood plank which provides extra sturdiness. I am very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Delivery straight to my doorstep. For comparison, I'm a 60 yo woman. I was able to unbox and assemble this bed, by myself, in about an hour and a half. All parts were in the box. Only bit of difficulty I encountered was not having a drill to secure the outlet to the headboard. It's a good idea to keep the frame pieces really loose until you have attached both the headboard the foot board to the bed frame. Otherwise, you're going to be loosening a lot of screws unnecessarily. Slept on it last night and had a perfect nights sleep. The cat likes it, too. I was particularly impressed with the sturdiness of the headboard. I worry about whether this all metal bed frame will creak over time, but will wait with a good attitude. I like the bed. It looks higher quality than the price would indicate. The stitching on the headboard is tight. Very nice bed frame. Highly recommend.",
