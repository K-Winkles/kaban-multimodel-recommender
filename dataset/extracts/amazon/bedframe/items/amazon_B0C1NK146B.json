                "reviewText": "I\u2019m disappointed in this bed to say the least. Was so excited to get this for my daughter and upon opening the box I saw it looked dingy. I unwrapped the plastic thinking it was just that. But no. The fabric itself is dirty. There is even a shoe print where someone stepped on the panel. There are dents and dings everywhere. The legs are extremely flimsy and anticipate they will break off very soon. The side boards in also concerned about. Putting in the bolts I could hear the wood crack when they were barely tightened. Don\u2019t let the LED lights persuade you. Buy a string separate for $15 and get the same results. If I try to return, it would cost me more money than it\u2019s worth, so there goes $180 out the window. Some say you get ehat you paid for, but I bought a bed for $90 at Walmart that lasted 7yrs until I sold it to \u201cupgrade\u201d to this one. I say don\u2019t waste your money on this.",

It came with a remote and I can attach the lights to an app. There are so many colors I can use to set that mood(Can you tell that is my favorite part)Very good quality for the price! I did not put together myself, I used Task Rabbit but it was very quick for him to put together and he put it together by himself. If you are looking for a classy, quality product I would highly recommend purchasing this. You wont be disappointed!",

However, the bolts in the hardware packs were completely rusted and had residue all over them. Needless to say this made assembling the white fabric bed frame a little challenging. We had to be extremely careful and it took two of us.. one to hold the frame and one to handle the hardware so as to not get the red rust particles all over the bed. For the money it is a nice looking bed and seems sturdy enough. The lights were a little disappointing, just a 6' led sticky strip to sit on the top of the headboard.",
