                "reviewText": "I wish I would have remembered to take pictures. At least I got one of the parts package.Speaking of packaging, I am beyond impressed with how this bed was shipped. It came in a sturdy box (that I saved to use for storage) that seemed barely big enough to hold a twin size bed, I ordered a king.The parts package was divided by step 1, 2, 3, ect. Each piece was clearly marked and the stickers were easy to remove.I have put together many items over the years (including multiple bed frames) this one had really easy to follow instructions.I put this together by myself. It took me most of the day only because I had to stop and start. If I worked straight through it most likely would have taken 2 hours or less.On the very last piece (before the mattress support bars) there were 2 holes that were not completely drilled through. Luckily I had a drill, so ended up not being that big of a problem.Use-I didn't want a platform bed but that seems to be the only thing anyone sells anymore. So I was skeptical. My mattress was made to go with box springs and it's about 8 years old so it's not exactly the most comfortable. But I'm absolutely sure that is the fault of my mattress and not the bed frame. I'm going to buy a new mattress soon.The frame itself is very sturdy. I have 3 dogs that weigh 60-80lbs each and 3 teenage kids. The dogs jump on and off the bed all day. The kids plom down, wrestle with the dogs. The bed never moves or creaks. The kids, the dogs and I have had several movie nights (the air conditioning is best in my room) the bed didn't move around, it's sturdy yet comfortable.The other problem is that the footboard doesn't go above my mattress. So I can't see it. I wanted to hang a blanket over the footboard. That's just a personal preference that I can deal with.I hope I never need to",

                "reviewText": "The bed frame is easy to assemble with two people, and seems sturdy without being wobbly or noisy. So many of these cheap Chinese bed frames have six legs instead of four; I bought this one specifically because of the four legs. I was not willing to have ugly support legs halfway down the length of the frame rail. Not only are those aesthetically tragic, but they can take out toes as well. 18\" is a pretty high frame, and maybe too high for some. We wanted our mattress tops to be around 28 to 30 inches, so with a 10\" mattress it worked out fine. The frame is just a platform. The mattress doesn't fit recessed in the frame so it slides around freely. Hasn't been an issue, but I thought (assumed) the frame would hold the mattress in place with the side rails sticking up a little higher than the slats. Holes in the frame for connecting to a headboard DO NOT LINE UP with standard headboard connections, so our headboards are simply leaning against the wall with the frames pushed up against the headboards. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a cheap metal frame with 18\" height and no additional support legs. Nothing special, but gets the job done.",
