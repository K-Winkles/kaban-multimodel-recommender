                "reviewText": "Since my bed is traditionally at floor level, I bought this bed frame to be ready for the recovery period for upcoming foot surgery. Finally built the bed, had the surgery and am currently using it for about 6 weeks.The Good: If you can turn a wrench, it goes together fast and easily. It's solid once built. i'm about 170 pounds and there's no wavering or wobbling when I'm on it.The not so good: About 2 weeks into using it each night (and much of the day), it acquired a few small creaking noises. Now, 6 weeks in, it's got more creaks and moans. I predict the downfall of this bed frame is that after a year, it'll sound like Grampa's old farm truck, a-groanin' and a squeakin' and a creakin' every time you move on it. We'll see. The parts go together very snugly, so I'm not sure what could be done during assembly to counteract the tendency to creak. There's no room to put plastic slipsheets or suchlike between the parts.",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved and needed to buy another queen bed frame. I flocked to ZINUS without hesitation! I set up a frame about six years ago at my mother's residence in the same exact design- Yelena 14\"- due to it not making a single noise for the six years of use!! Back then, I spent hours going through reviews of other manufacturers/companies design issues, squeaks, missing parts and lengthy assembly times. When I ordered the original frame, the setup took less than an hour and I've not even needed to tighten a single bolt using it!This time around, the price had increased and I was on a budget, so I did shop around again but this time the other frame reviews seemed worse than back then! While ZINUS's price on this frame has gone up a bit, I ordered it. The framing is now just as sturdy but with a slightly slender bar design and somewhat rounded frame corners. If you're like me, I catch my shin on the corners every now and again, so this perk made me very happy!! I love their anti-slip adhesive strips, the only issue I've ever had with the mattress was the sheet coming off, never the mattress moving which is a sigh of relief when you have no headboard or footboard!The assembly comes neatly labeled and still takes about an hour with one person. They provide both an allen wrench and a socket wrench with an allen wrench attachment built in to make it even easier, with two people it would probably take 30 minutes!The bolts all come neatly organized in a package,labelled by letter and the instructions are easy to read.I cannot recommend this frame enough if you want sleek, sturdy and no headache!!",

It is visually very sleek, lovely powder coated steel pieces, in a matte black, smooth, modern finish. It was mostly easy to put together, it came with an Allen wrench which I never used, and a mini rachet wrench that was very convenient. Whomever designed the printed instructions is a sadist. I looked at the pictograms and ran with that. if you try to follow the alpha numeric instructions they have included, I hope you have your local asylum on speed dial. When complete, it is solid and lightweight, easy to move around, even with a mattress. It is very high with a mattress only, I don\u2019t recommend also using a box spring, it would end up higher than your hip. The high clearance underneath, which was the deal clincher for choosing this model for me, is excellent. You can easily fit standard sterility lidded storage boxes and many other things underneath. Very important if you are an apartment dweller like me, and have limited space, and zero storage space. Overall, this product met, and in many ways exceeded my expectations.",
