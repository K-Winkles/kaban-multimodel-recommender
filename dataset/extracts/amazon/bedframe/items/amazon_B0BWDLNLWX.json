                "reviewText": "I got this for the twin mattress in my craft room which gets occasionally used as a nap bed or guest bed. Since the mattress was previously on the floor, this created a fantastic amount of storage space! I chose the 18 inch tall frame, which is high enough to store even sizeable boxes underneath. I also added an LED light strip to the underside of the frame with stick-on clips for a neat lighting feature. The frame is solid and strong, but not excessively heavy to assemble on my own. The instructions were sufficient and all parts and basic tools were included. The fact that it tends to fold in the middle even after full assembly made getting it in place by myself challenging; it would be easier with two people to handle it. The final bedframe in place with mattress atop it wobbles slightly when I climb on (200 lb adult) but not badly or such that it's noticeable except when climbing on or off the bed. My cat does not approve, but I'm sure she'll like it once she gets used to it.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't like how it quite obviously looked like someone had already assembled it and disassembled it before. There were tool marks and scratches here and there. However, the structural integrity was not affected and it went together smoothly. Nothing was missing. It holds my weight and its easy to move.Furthermore, its supposed to collapse but mine folds to a 90\u00b0 angle and that's kind of disappointing. You also need to remove the slats before you fold it/move it, or else, they will fall out very easily.",
