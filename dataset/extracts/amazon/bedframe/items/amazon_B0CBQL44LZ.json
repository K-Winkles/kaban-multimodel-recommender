With lights and extra storage, I kept telling them I just needed a something simple. I left and went on Amazon to see what I could find and stumbled upon this bed frame. It was perfect a really good price, and metal to last me longer. It fit my full size mattress, it might be too tall for my dogs to jump on but that okay. I really do like this bed frame.",

                "reviewText": "I liked that it is all metal. I did not want wood slats so this was a great choice for me. It was simple to put together. It took about 40 minutes all together. I got rid of my box spring as the slats are close together to support my memory foam mattress (my mattress is also really tall so the box spring would have made my bed too high). The only thing that is an issue is that it is missing a rubber pad for one of the feet, but I put a piece of felt under it. I did not contact the company about this issue.",
