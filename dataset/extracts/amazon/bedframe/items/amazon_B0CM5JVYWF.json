We put some totes/bins under the bed and its so nice to have everything organized. The assembly was not bad. The instructions were clear to me. The cheap tools they send with it are \"cheap\" for sure but that doesn't affect the actual bed frame, it just hurts my hand a bit trying to tighten the bolts with that tiny allen key and flat wrench. The frame is strong and doesn't make any squeaks or creaks with is awesome. I really don't like that squeak bed frame sound. Not sure what else to say except it was worth the purchase.",
