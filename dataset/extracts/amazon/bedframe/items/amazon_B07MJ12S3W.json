                "reviewText": "Okay, I really expected this to be partly assembled and just a fold out. NO!!!!!Nothing assembled. I do admit it was easy to assemble, but not quick. The instructions are horrible. Matching part number to item is...well the screws etc, they are NOT labeled, it is count and guess.Then the cross bars. I suggest using a rubber mallet.In the end I got it together, but that middle leg.I have stubbed my toe on it so many times already in 4 days. I suggest getting a water noddle an cutting a slit in it and putting it around the leg. Less damage to the toes.But after it was together, it is very sturdy and stays in place. I can say it is very strong. Two adults sleep on it.Worth the money but just expect to assemble it all.Caution the Box is heavy.",

                "reviewText": "This bed frame is perfect. It was super easy to assemble, it took me about 20 mins from the time I opened the box until when I put my mattress on it. After reading the reviews, I purchased some insulation foam before the frame arrived. I made sure to put that on the exposed legs. This was a great tip as I hit my toes on the legs multiple times while making the bed, thankfully the foam saved me! I would highly recommend this frame to anyone.",

Unlike my last frame. Also takes so much less space than my last bed frame. It took a second person to help me with the first step. Gotta use both hands for the 1st part. You have to rotate the screw and nail opposite sides to tighten it. not sure how to describe too well .. but I over all love it so much and definitely worth the price",
