The metal frame is nice and sturdy- box spring is not needed, the mattress will be just fine on it alone. The outlets are nice, especially with the 2 usb spots. My son doesn\u2019t need night stands anymore since this has plug-ins and the headboard is wide enough to hold his tablet, phone, books, etc. I would definitely Recommend this bed",

This bed is solid and perhaps the only drawback is the sheet number of parts required for assembly. Bed is solid, looks good, and doesn\u2019t scoot across the floor. Would recommend to anyone.",

Has lots of room for storage underneath and doesn\u2019t need a box spring. Foam around the feet stop you from stubbing your toes on the supports. Loved this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I put this together myself (59 yr old female) & after a few errors that made me backtrack, It took about 1 1/2 hrs. The instructions are pictures only, but it still wasn't that difficult. Remember to not tighten the screws on the slats until screws on both sides are started...the slat can then be adjusted to meet up with the hole. It's ingenius how they did that! You get an extra screw for each size, all the tools needed, and, AND, every single screw hole lined up properly. Every one...the whole time I was putting it together, I was thinking, no way! Then I'd come across one that seemed like it didn't line up--but slight adjustments for angles and yep! I was so impressed. It comes packaged very well with all parts clearly marked. Way higher quality than I was expecting given the great price!The slight edge at the bottom holds the mattress in place, but it does slide a bit from side to side, and the end corners are easy to run in to, so if kids are around, be careful, and don't hit your shin.Well worth the price, and I'm glad to see some companies still care about quality, and making sure the darn screw holes line up!!",
