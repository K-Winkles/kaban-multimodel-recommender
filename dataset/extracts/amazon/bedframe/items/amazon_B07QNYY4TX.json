I weigh 115-117 lbs and I laid down as heavily as I could on the bed after putting his mattress on it and checked to see if it sank in, made noise, or moved from the spot I put it on the floor..... it did none of these. I think you can attach a headboard to it. I just left it in case my 11 y.o. decides he wants a particular headboard on it when he's older. It also has quite a bit of space from the floor to the bottom of the bed if you ever need to store something under it.I'd buy this again for sure.",

I would say assembly definitely needs two people. My daughter had to help me with this and it took us almost an hour or so to finally get it all together. One of the bars had trouble sliding in place and got stuck. It nearly cut us when trying to pull it out. The instructions are easy to read and understand and it comes with all the tools and parts you need. You won\u2019t need additional tools.I\u2019ve had it now for a few months and have no complaints. It\u2019s easy to move and I love it\u2019s height. It was a bit out of my price range but if price isn\u2019t an issue this is the one to go with.",

I love it so far but I also was sleeping on the floor lol. Maybe I wont screw the halves together. Plus side itllmake 2 great twin beds! Oh for $106.00 this is my best investment since my car! Week update love it! Was worried about feeling bars through the mattress so I put my japanese floormat under my mattress which is a thin type memory foam. I love that this bed feels solid no creaking as my other metal frame did yet is so light and easy to move. Great frame!",

It is very very very solid, no squeaking, none! And no need for a bedspring. My queen-size mattress fits perfectly.The only problem was the headboard: the holes the slots of the iron base were not aligned with the holes in my headboard, so I simply drilled 2 new ones, and so far so good. I know people like to rave about the space underneath the bed, and how much they can fit under there, but I love how it looks empty, clean, it gives the impression of my bedroom being much more spacious and spotless just because of that wide empty space. Highly recommand; will revisit this comment in a year, just to see if I'm still happy with my purchase.",
