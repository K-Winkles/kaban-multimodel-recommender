                "reviewText": "This bedframe is so well designed. I have not seen anything that requires assembly with such amazing engineering in decades. The parts fit together easily and align without having to beat them together with a hammer or re-drill holes to get parts to align. Unexpectedly, the fasteners are high quality and screw together with ease. I'm 64 and have bad knees and bad back and I was able to assemble it by myself easily. All tools for assembly are included, however I would suggest you have a 5mm hex bit that fits your power drill/wrench and an adjustable wrench and rubber mallet.This thing is heavy duty and so the box is kind of heavy. I like the 18\" height. With a 10 - 12\" mattress on top it is easy to get up and down for old geezers like me with bad knees. This also gives you plenty of room to store stuff under the bed. There is a heavy duty center beam support that goes from head to foot board. The cross slats are slightly higher at the center support than where they attach to the outside edge rail. This is a brilliant design because it will keep your mattress from bowing or sagging in the middle which is common on cheap bedframes. The bottom of the post supports have plastic caps so it is easy to slide the bed around.. If you wanted to attach a headboard or footboard it appears that would be easy to do if your handy with tools. I got this to use in a spare room temporarily. The price and quality is amazing. I would highly recommend. For the record I'm not that easy to please so that's why I was blown away by this frame and it's design.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant about how sturdy this bed would be, but it is actually really great. The slats all fit together perfectly, the instructions were very simple, and no hardware was required (although instructions do say an electric drill is recommended so that you can tighten screws as far as they go to avoid the squeaking some folks have noted in their comments). The storage underneath is awesome; in my head it wasn't going to be that much but I can actually climb under my bed comfortably now, so that is fantastic. I don't love sleeping close to the ground so that's actually why we bought this one, but with my 11 inch mattress we are about 3 feet off the ground, so not bad at all. I got the California King size, and it's a little longer than my mattress (maybe 3 inches). I'm not sure if that's a problem with my mattress or just how the frame was designed, to give some leeway, but I am okay with it. I'd rather have a little extra space than not enough! I love how sturdy it is, just watch out for the legs when your walking by. My husband hit his toe twice once we got it up, they are placed exactly on the end so very available to run into.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this for about a month with a 10\u201d mattress on it. There are no squeaks or creaks. The installation was easy once we figured out how to tighten the bolts. We watched a YouTube video, to assist. I love the extra space underneath for storage. I\u2019m in a small bedroom with little storage space so this helps a lot.",

                "reviewText": "This product was very easy to put together. I did it by myself in about 30 minutes. The mattress is a bit smaller than the frame. But unlike other reviewers, it's not a big deal to me. You won't even see it once the bed wear is over it. The frame is very sturdy too. It also looks good. There plenty of room under the bed for storage.",

It's super sturdy and has great storage. I got the taller one since I figured my box springs wouldn't fit in the lip of it but they fit great! With even a little wiggle room. Although nothing has shifted around.",

The mattress is one of the roll up kind that arrives rolled up in the box and needs a platform type frame for support. This frame works great with that mattress. Very easy to set up and perfect fit for the queen mattress. I bought the 18 inch high frame to provide storage space under the bed, and with that height we store quite a bit of stuff under the bed and hidden out of sight.",

                "reviewText": "Super sturdy, relatively easy to assemble - at first it looked difficult but I slowly placed all the parts our and then it was honestly really easy. I did it without a second person in probably less than an hour.I'm very very happy with this purchase. the very best part is getting rid of bed skirts and hello under bed storage. I bought the 18\" queen frame without headboard access (didn't realize there was that option). I can't tell you how happy I am with the storage and now my pup and kitty sleep right below my head and I bought 4 big storage bins and then had to go back and buy 4 more! I have all my linens now under the bed in locking containers and still there is room for the pup and kitty. I just now decided to change my whole house over to this type of bed frame. I now bought a queen and king 14 inch tall frame. I'll have in a few more days. They don't have as much clearance under for big Rubbermaid bins but I'm looking at options.So happy I signed in just to leave a review for those that are on the fence. Love the frame and also love the clearance under the bed. I can now vacuum any time!!",
