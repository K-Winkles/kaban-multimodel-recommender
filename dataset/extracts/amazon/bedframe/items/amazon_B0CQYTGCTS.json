                "reviewText": "Against my better judgement we purchased the triple bunk bed that has the two bottom beds facing outward. The instructions required a PHD to understand, there were no pictures, and it was extremely unclear. I believe it took over 4 hours to build. Then to make matters worse, the little shelf from the top bunk was missing. So now we need an EXTRA long twin bed or to build something out of plywood to cover the huge hole.",

                "reviewText": "TWIN XL OPTION does NOT fix it, still a 1FT GAP @5ft in the air! I returned this item for numerous reasons, but the biggest concern was the missing top bunk shelf. After reviewing multiple other customer reviews stating the same problem, I realized that it wasn't just my order, the product simply doesn't include it. The flat top bunk shelf displayed in product photos at the foot of the top bunk is non-existent in both the box and instruction manual. This leaves a 1.5ft dangerous gap of space exposing the thin and widely-spaced metal bed slats at over a 5ft height. This gap is an accident waiting to happen for anyone, but extremely likely for children. I researched putting a twin xl on the top, but because it only adds 5in, there would still be a 1ft gap, which somehow seemed worse with the slate placement. Also, nuts and bolts are used to secure the bed, and some bolts exceed the bolt length by 2-3 cm. Regardless of what side I chose to have the bolts protrude, it was either dangerous for my son frequently going up and down the ladder or for my son on the lower bunk. My 10-year old son gashed his leg on one the first night. I researched so many triple bunks before ordering this one, and there are many other options in this price range that either state the top needs to be a twin xl or includes that crucial part of the bed. Hope this helps someone! :)",
