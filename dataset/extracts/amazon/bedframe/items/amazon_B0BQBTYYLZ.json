                "reviewText": "The full-size platform frame arrived a day early. It arrived in the factory box and weighed a little over 41 lbs. Everything needed for set-up was included in the box: easy instructions, allen wrench, extra screws, foot pads, mattress stoppers, etc. Set-up took between 45 - 60 minutes with the most tedious part being the tightening of the screws. We got this to support a hybrid mattress and, so far, it feels super sturdy and very quiet.",
