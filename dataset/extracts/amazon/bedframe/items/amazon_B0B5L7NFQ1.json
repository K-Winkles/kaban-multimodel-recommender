The lights are a sleek touch and the hidden shelving is good for extra items. Only problem I have is the plugs are hard to take chargers out of, I really have to yank them hard every time.

                "reviewText": "I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. I really like it. It looks nice, it's sturdy, fairly easy to put together, but are the upholstery fumes slowly poisoning me in my sleep? Not sure. What I do know is that when I pulled it out of the box it made me sneeze a lot (I have a super sensitive nose though) and even after 3 weeks, I can still smell it. It's definitely dissipating, but my super nose can still detect it. Here's some other points...Fairly easy to put together but be careful not to strip the allen wrenchThe LED lights are awesome! The sticky that holds them up not so awesome, it keeps coming down in one corner. But I love the lights, it has an app and you can program them to any color as well as auto turn off/on. I haven't tried the feature where they react to your musicMy cats have only tried to claw it twice, so far so good...It's short, if you are going from a bed frame with a box spring to just this and a mattress, you will notice a difference, but it's not horribleWhy is the cord for the LED lights 5 miles long while the plug in for the outlet way too short??The shelf is not as wide as I thought it would be, but it will fit my phone and a book, although the book hangs over the edge a bitAside from the fumes, I'm glad I got it and would recommend.",

It took me about and hour and a half to put together. The lights are a cool feature. Seems to be sturdy and well built from what I can tell.",

                "reviewText": "We needed to upgrade my son's loft bed with something more grown up. We upgraded to a full size mattress with this bed frame and it was a nice choice. Easy to assemble. Lights and outlets are cool in the headboard. My son expected the storage to be a little bigger/deeper, but it's still nice to have a little hiding spot. He decided the bed needed more LED's so he ran a strip under the frame of the bed and it looks pretty cool now.",
