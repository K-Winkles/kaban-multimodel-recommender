It was also easy for one person to assemble. It is very sturdy and does not creak or squeak.However, the bed sits MUCH lower to the floor than what it portrays in the ad. If you use a box spring, then it will be fine, but if you are using it as a platform bed, then be prepared to be lower to the ground.Also, the LED lights will NOT stay attached. The adhesive is too weak, and they just fall down after a few hours. I am going to try getting more clips and see if that helps.",

We had to take the little plastic stoppers that were on the ends off to get them to fit and the plastic stoppers were not easy to get out what should have taken 2-3 minutes for that part took us about 10Once out together it looks nice but I don\u2019t understand why some of the bars fit and others didn\u2019t and then the light situation was ridiculous and thankfully we didn\u2019t have plans to put the bed in the center of the room",

The led light strip was kind of a pain in the butt as it does not fully go around so becatefull with your starting point and also have a bunch of super glue on hand cause there lights do not stick.... Other then that black zip ties and a good length of tube lights would be a better solution.",

                "reviewText": "Visually and bead frame support is great. Pretty easy to put together. The however is what most people talk about here are the lights. I will say the lights work as should and look wonderful helping it complete that floating look. The problem is they don't stick. I used the few support things they have that come with it. Those stick very well. The backing of the actual lights do not. I stopped the blue part of the back of the lights and wrapped into around the frame. I may cover this with black electrical in the future. This seemed to work pretty well. Overall as advertised and a great looking frame. The lights stickiness nonexistent but you can manage with some creativity. 4 out 5 due the lights since that is part of the product. Probably could replace the lights with a higher end light system on you own but why do that",
