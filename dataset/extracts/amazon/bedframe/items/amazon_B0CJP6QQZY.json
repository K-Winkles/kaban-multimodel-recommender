                "reviewText": "This bed frame is much better than I expected. The parts were securely packaged and wrapped so that they did not get scuffed or damaged during shipment and it came with all of the hardware pieces and tools to successfully assemble the frame. The black powder coat finish has a satin look and will tie in well with most coordinating furniture. The instructions were moderately clear, but you can figure it out after looking them over a few times. Once you get the first couple of pieces together, they all seem to fall into place with ease. This frame is the perfect platform for a memory foam mattress because it is the correct height once the mattress is on it and you will not need a box spring to add extra height or support. Since the frame is so high, you can store good sized boxes underneath if you wanted, but remember there are support legs down the center of the frame. This frame is the ultimate for sturdiness and there is zero shimmy or shake once you put a memory foam mattress on top of it. It has an excellent support structure for the mattress and you will not get any sagging areas. The frame is relatively light for two people to maneuver without a mattress on top and you will probably want to take the weight of the mattress off of it if you move the bed frame around the room. I was expecting the rounded legs on all four corners of the bed frame, but they are only at the foot of the bed and the head of the frame has rectangular boxed legs. Nevertheless, the legs at the head of the bed also have rectangular slots cut into them which would allow for mounting a custom headboard if you so desired. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the quality of this bed frame and I love the height combined with the absolute stability.",
