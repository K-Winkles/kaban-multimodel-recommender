I would have definitely given this bed a 5 star however\u2026\u2026..As you can tell from the video and the picture, the part marked J and where part N attaches to J are misaligned so the screw cant be screwed on. Since I ordered 2 beds we were able to use part J from the 2nd bed and assemble the bed. It does seem sturdy and well worth the money. Even though I now have to figure out how to get the misaligned part replaced I would still recommend and purchase another one of these beds. Now how do I get that part replaced??",
