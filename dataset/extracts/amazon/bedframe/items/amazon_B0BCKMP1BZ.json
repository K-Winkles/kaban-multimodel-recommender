                "reviewText": "I assembled this in about an hour and a half with my dog assisting\ud83d\ude06 I used a power screwdriver and bit that made it fast. They sent a few extra of each of the hardware. The horizonal supports between the headboard and footboard are hinged and preassembled. The footboard is low and my 10in mattress sits even with it. Very happy with it and can't wait for it to get cool enough for nicer bedding.",

                "reviewText": "This frame was easy to assemble until we got 3/4 of the way through and realized one of the pieces was defective. The center bar where the mattress support was supposed to attach had been drilled improperly, making the foot of the bed slope down sharply. Rather than take apart and return the whole thing, we had a tool-savvy relative come re-drill the holes in the correct spot. Overall 3 stars for the defect, and not the sturdiest frame I've bought online, but so far it works and looks nice.",

It creaks and squeaks with every roll over and impromptu bounce house session from the kids. It\u2019s solid for sure. I love the look of the bed. Just know that it\u2019s still metal and will still make noise. Ain\u2019t no way you\u2019ll be sneaking a love session in without the household hearing.",
