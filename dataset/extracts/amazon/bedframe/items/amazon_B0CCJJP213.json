The doors do rattle a bit, but if you put pillows over them it alleviates that annoyance, as it does with people as well.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: Really liked the style, awful design and materials. Just go to IKEA.Bought June/July 2023 and at the beginning of February 2024 it died. It was giving out over time but immediately upon purchase 4 of the cross slats broke with a week. Eventually enough slats broke that we didn\u2019t have enough slats to support the bed and had to use some plywood to hold us up. About two weeks ago the center support decided to clock out for lunch and never come back to work. At this point all the slats went on strike and the only thing holding us was the 1\u201d plywood we added. It was this morning February 3, 2024 the whole union fell and we had to dissolve the company\u2026 i mean bed frame and throw it out.I really liked the style it had but for the price this wasn\u2019t what i was expecting.",

But way smaller drawers than I\u2019m used to, which is a personal problem, I know, but I do wish they were a bit deeper and wider.Everything assembled well. It did take us several nights after work and some extra wood glue but the directions were very straight forward.",

                "reviewText": "My son and I assembled the bed, the instructions were easy to follow.I took off a star because in one step the labeling of which side was \"Up\" on a board seems to be backward, or the arrow should be changed to prevent confusion, along with a couple of very minor issues with the veneer in spots that won't be obvious. Also, other reviews that mention the doors rattling are accurate. The bottom of the doors each have two pieces that fit into grooves but those pieces are too thin for a snug fit, allowing them to rattle with any movements. It was a simple enough fix; we used tiny pieces of black duct tape to add thickness and make them fit properly. Voila! No more rattling, and the pieces in the grooves aren't visible so they're not an eyesore. I'm glad it was easy to fix, but I think the manufacturers should make a change so that buyers don't have to come up with their own solution.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this bed in the Light Rustic Oak. It arrived earlier than the estimated delivery date. The bed and 5 drawer dresser were packed very well and clearly labeled. There were no damaged parts or missing pieces. The hardware itself came individually packaged and labeled in one box. The assembly instructions were fairly easy once we got going. It took us 3 hours and 31 minutes to put this bed together. Seems to be sturdy and well made. The UL-listed AC power (2 AC outlets + 2 USB ports) are pleasantly convenient especially if you have limited power sources. LOVE the sliding barn door on the headboard to store remotes, phones, glasses, etc. leaving a clean uncluttered look. We coupled this with a 12\u201d Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and couldn\u2019t be happier with the results! We're considering investing in the nightstands now that we have it all put together. Kudos to the manufacturers and seller. Great product for the value!",

I would not purchase this for a child's room because the corners are too sharp. The sliding doors are a beautiful feature, but I had to remove them the first night because they rattle. The bed still looks good without them, but the pretty design is lost. It is not as sturdy a product as other self-assembled, inexpensive furniture I have bought. Overall, I am happy but not in love with the piece. With a few small design changes, it could be quite excellent.",

Totally in love with the overall vibe!! The one and only snag is the faulty plank design. If I didn't love it as much as I do and if it wasn't as huge and heavy as it is, it would go back. I'm soooo annoyed with the bottom breaking regularly. It requires me to move the entire mattress, me climbing under the bed and fixing the planks-- only for it to happen again! There's nothing worse than it happening at the end of a long day... Which has been the case multiple times. Maybe it's defective? Idk. If anyone has ideas... Please let me know.",
