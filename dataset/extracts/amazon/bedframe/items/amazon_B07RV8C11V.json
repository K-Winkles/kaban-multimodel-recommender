                "reviewText": "I got this bed to sort of hold me over until I found something to fit the \u201caesthetic\u201d I was going for but honestly I\u2019ve been so impressed that I stopped looking for something different. It\u2019s sturdy and strong, I was a little bit hesitant since there is only one center support but like I said, it\u2019s definitely withstood pretty good wear! It isn\u2019t completely silent, I don\u2019t want to mislead you, but it\u2019s not even close to loud. The height is perfect, it looks elevated in the room and you can fit storage totes underneath! We have the king",

                "reviewText": "This bed frame has a lot of pluses. The only thing that I do not like so much is the sharp corners that protrude at the foot of the bed. Already I have banged my leg on it a couple of times after only having it for a few days. Aside from that, it is a great bed frame.What I liked:- no middle leg at the foot of the bed - love this!- very sturdy and easy to assemble - all parts fit well- pre-drilled for headboard attachment- good price and a great value- looks great and is so much easier to clean under the bed now- love the 18\" height- loved saying goodbye to my old frame and clunky box springDid not like so much:- sharp corners at the foot of the bed (ouch!)- the length of the frame could be a bit shorter for a queen mattress; I pulled my mattress as far as I could toward the foot to lessen the sharp corner hazard but still, my knee collided with the corner- would greatly prefer rounded corners at the foot- took MONTHS before my order arrived",

                "reviewText": "This bed frame took under 30 minutes to assemble, is solid, high quality (holes aligned, screws worked, everything was in box), and arrived on time. The box is heavy, though. One thing I wasn't keen about is that instructions say to use a power driver to tighten the screws to prevent squeaking however it's a hex head, and I didn't have those bits for my driver. But I don't hear squeaking. Aside from that I'm thoroughly pleased with the product, and would buy again.",
