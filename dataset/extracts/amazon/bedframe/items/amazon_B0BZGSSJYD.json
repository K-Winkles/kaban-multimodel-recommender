                "reviewText": "This is a nice bed, I like the velvety fabric of the head and foot board, and it seems well made. However, I bought this bed because I wanted a certain under bed storage. I needed at least 13\u201d clearance, and the specs state that this bed frame has a 14.2\u201d clearance. The clearance is actually more like 12.2\u201d and the top of the slats don\u2019t even reach 14\u201d. So if you are looking for a bed with large than normal storage space underneath, this is not it.Update: the company reached out to me offering to replace the bed since it wasn\u2019t as advertised. I turned them down as I didn\u2019t feel like taking apart the one I got an making a new one, but they did notify me that they have remeasured and amended the issue for future purchasers. Overall, my interaction with the company have been great, and the bed is still nice and what I was looking for otherwise.",
