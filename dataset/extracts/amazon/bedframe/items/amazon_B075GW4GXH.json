                "reviewText": "I was a bit uncertain when ordering this bed, after I received it and assembled, it's a great buy. It's well packaged, just right not over packaged. Made of real wood, not MDF, the slats are plywood, that's fine. All parts are well built, comes with clear instructions, and all parts are number labeled, that makes it super easy to assemble. It even comes with a few extra hardware, very thoughtful. I particularly like the way that the slats are attached to the bed, so they won't randomly move when you putting mattress on the bed. Overall it's really good at the price, better than Ikea.",

                "reviewText": "***6 month updateStill an awesome bedframe. Still the same solid, uncreakable, unbreakable bed that came in the annoyingly secure box in July 2022. I will ABSOLUTELY purchase another when I buy a home. Affordable, stylish, sturdy, reliable. Money is tight these days and this purchase won't make you feel like an idiot for trusting that something so affordable can actually be a decent item for ownership.I'm a researcher---and I don't like spending money on stuff that is misrepresented, and I'll sure as heck send it back. I travel around a lot because of education and work--so my \"bed frame\" was a cheap wallyworld metal frame that a nice mattress sat upon. Looked terrible, but there it is.This bed was extraordinarily affordable, which gave me pause. It came in a huge, long cardboard container---and was packed so carefully I was annoyed at how much wrapping I had to undo. So it came in pristine condition.I laid out all of the pieces, which are marked clearly with numbers and letters, all of the hardware is in a packet that has corresponding numbers and letters. EASY PEASY. The pieces all fit together without any further \"modification\" and I had it together within an hour by myself. All tools included.The finish is very nice. I got the Rustic Pine---and it is NICE. Not too dark, not blonde...just a golden, creamy color much like honey oak but a little more ash. My decor is mission---and this is why I chose this bed. It fits perfectly.I am 5'6\" and weigh 145lbs. I have not had a squeak, creak, or wobble. Not one. I have a 110 lb dog that jumps up, so a second \"person\" is also on the bed. No movement. No cracking or breaking or nonsense like these others are saying. ***first off, please be specific about your weight and activities when you claim the bed \"broke and cracked\". I can guarantee---you're putting >500lbs onto this bed and then expecting it to act like a steel frame while you do tandem acrobatics. It's nonsensical from what I see in this frame---especially if you're of a healthy weight. If you want to put >500lbs or even close to that on a frame....BUY A STEEL FRAME.There is a nice 8 inch clearance underneath where I have stored several suitcases and some other items. The height of the bed is PERFECT for me--I can imagine it may seem a little low for someone over 6', but otherwise, it's just a nice height.I've had the bed for a month now---and I stand by my initial impression---STURDY (when you're not putting a 2 ton wrecking ball to it) and very pretty. Easy construction and very clear instructions on how to do that.For those that are gonna sit there and measure the distance between slats....seriously. You need to focus that energy on solving world hunger. Really. Seriously. Nobody actually cares.I would buy this again for an additional room if/when I have one. Very nice for the money.",

                "reviewText": "This really surprised me. First, the bed frame was packaged very well. Lots of foam yo protect the wood. The screws were all on a card, labeled, and plastic sealed. It was built well. All the screws aligned perfectly and well. The instructions were simple. No words, but huge well thought out diagrams showing each step with a number and a diagram of each screw for each step. Very easy to read and assemble. The kit not only included the necessary Allan wrench, but also has a small ratchet tool. I was impressed! It looks great and us very sturdy. My only thing, is that I would have liked to see the headboard taller...but that's just my personal preference and nothing to do with the quality of the product. Good buy!",

The price point was wonderful under $200.Fast forward to delivery. I was in luck and home when the truck pulled up so I was able to ask the guys to place the box in my garage.First impression when I tried to reposition the box was, wow the reviews are true the quality of this bed must be amazing because I couldn\u2019t move the box for nothing, it is VERY heavy!I had to open the box and bring each piece in 1 x 1, and the quality is cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me!It\u2019s beautiful pine. It smells amazing, feels amazing. It\u2019s a gorgeous frame. I wish the headboard were a bit higher, but even down the slats and how they are buckled it with wood grooves, it\u2019s a very well made bed.Instructions were great, and tools and pieces were great quality. I cannot believe this bed sells for $200 as a King size.",

The pieces are well labeled, the instructions are easy to follow and the pieces are light but very well made. Some of the features I really liked was the slats that act as the box spring actually velcro to the bed frame so you don't have them moving around or falling through like other beds. This is so smart and defintiley one of the highlights that made me so satisfied with this purchase. On the top of these slats there is two long sticky pads which holds the mattress in place so it doesn't move around either. The bed frame is ridiculously sturdy, I'm talking like not even moving an cm let alone banging against a wall or creaking. I was also really impressed with the quality and colour of the wood. After reading some reviews some said it wasn't true to the picture but I disagree I think it was just what I expected. If you're looking for a wood bedframe wayfair's prices are upwards of 700$ and after comparing nearly every site from jysk, to ikea, to wayfair and overstock this was defintiley the cheapest wood frame for its style. Its lived up to all my expectations and I am so thrilled with it. The only thing I would want someone else to know is that if you have a really thick mattress alot of the headboard will be covered by it.",
