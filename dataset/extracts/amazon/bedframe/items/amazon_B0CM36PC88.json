You can see we opted not to do the slide....my son would never sleep! It wasn't difficult to put together if you follow the directions and take your time. and it feels nice and sturdy! I will say though look at the picture before you assemble because the description says the stairs and slide can be put on either side, but that's not true. The stairs will only fit on the left and we found that out the hard way.",

                "reviewText": "We got this bed because it had the parent/guardian spot. My son is autistic and can take up to two hours to get him asleep at night. It is nice to have a spot designated that I am not awkwardly laying or sitting on his bed, then disturb him trying to get up after he is asleep. Another review stated sharp edges, the only edge that is sharp of any concern is the corner railing between the bed and the parent spot. We just put a corner protector on it. The parent seat is squeaky with any movement, I think because there are no legs in the middle, and the cushion is like a cardboard with a bit of fabric over it. Read directions carefully and watch how you are putting it together. Definitely a two person assembly. The yellow sticker says it has to stay on for safety reasons. I wish it was in a better spot, hidden from a curious toddler. We might just remove it because it is starting to peel already. We have been using it for a week now. It is serving us for our current needs and our son is loving it. The parent spot even makes for a great reading spot for our son. He loves to sit there and read his books. It is quirky, but it is a great bed for what we were looking for!",

                "reviewText": "This bed was extremely difficult to install. First the bolts provided to install this bed have an allen head has a bottom that is too shallow and the bottom is not flat so when you insert the allen wrench it doesn\u2019t fit properly and you cant turn it to tighten it properly. Also the threaded inserts on the rails dont even match the bolt threads so when you try to tighten them the threads get damaged on both the bolts and threads on the rails. I had a really hard te turning the bolts because of this. I ended up breaking a bolt. You can imagine how difficult time it gave me to remove. Also the holes in the pols dont even go straight so when you insert a bolt through the pole it\u2019s completely misaligned. I also ended up stripping the allen heads which made three bolts not able to be removed. The overall feeling I got from this bed is it is of inferior quality. I also did not like how tiny and slim the bolts were that I fear the bed might break and fall on top of my kid and severely injure him. The welds for the front railing are also pretty thin that I believe the railing will come loose over time. I know this bed is for kids but I think they could have used thicker railing and wider cross beams to hold the listed weight limit. I can see the cross beams for the top bed bending more than half and inch with weight on top. If I knew this bed would be so bad would not have purchased . Now I cant return it because I cant remove the allen bolts that got stripped which will make it impossible to remove.",

It also squeaks so badly from every move. Overall it's not bad for the price, but I wouldn't recommend it.",
