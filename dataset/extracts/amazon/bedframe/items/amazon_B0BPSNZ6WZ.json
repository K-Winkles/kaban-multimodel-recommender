It feels nice and sturdy, it\u2019s a good height with my mattress and fits perfectly. The storage space is great. It doesn\u2019t make any noise, hopefully it stays that way. I recommend it, it\u2019s a good frame and not a bad price.",

It took approximately 20 minutes to put together- and that is only because I accidentally had one of the sides facing the wrong way when i screwed it in and had to unscrew and flip it around! But that was 100% me not paying attention. There is only a slight amount of assembly required as most of the frame just fits right into place when laid out. There are a couple screws on the four corners but the tool you need is included in the box!It is very sturdy when finished",

Between myself, husband, kids and dogs, it\u2019s held around 400 lbs at once.-Endless under the bed storage.-Great price and attractive.Cons-the California king frame does not fit our California king mattress well. We have a good 2 inches of extra metal at the foot of the bed.-There\u2019s no space for our box springs and it\u2019s causing minor mattress sagging in the middle.-It\u2019s slightly noisy when we toss and turn.-Bent metal that had to be fixed with hammer.
