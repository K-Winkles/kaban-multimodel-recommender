We decided to give it a try. The bed is to be used in our guest room but occasionally, if one or the other of us is sick, the other will sleep in the guest room to avoid being disturbed by coughing, etc. I am happy to say we were able to assemble the bed by ourselves. The parts are all clearly labeled and the numbered, pictorial directions are easy to follow. While they haven\u2019t visited since the bed arrived, we\u2019re sure our grandchildren will appreciate the charging station at the head of the bed. This was a very good purchase!",

It doesn\u2019t move around at all, it\u2019s VERY sturdy, easy assembly, I didn\u2019t have to deal with missing parts or anything. I did a lot of research and I\u2019m so glad I went with this one. Note that the led lights that come with only has 3 colors. I would go with getting another reel of leds if you want more color and they will work just as well!",
