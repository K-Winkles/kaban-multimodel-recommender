Came with all of the hardware but I think it's a big bonus that they include an extra piece of hardware for every piece you use just incase. Very straight forward to putting together. Would highly recommend using 2 people as warned in the directions but I was able to easily accomplish putting it together and standing it myself. The coloring of the wood is exactly what the images showed. I wasn't necessarily interested in the leds but once on they look amazing and I'm glad they are included. Super simple velcro on and plug in. Has an app where you can deeply customize the colors and functions. I'd definitely buy this item again",

I have experience building things, and have many tools however this thing was a pain in the you know what. Instructions weren't very helpful, as I had to adjust things as I went along.
