                "reviewText": "Bought 2 of these (champagne and silver) to use as carry ons for United airlines, and was very pleased with my purchase! Price was great and they ended up being a great value. They fit the dimensions perfectly, held way more than we needed for 5 days (with room for some souvenirs!), and were so smooth and easy to roll through airports. The handles feel a little flimsy when extended but we didn't have any issues with them while using. They were very durable and showed no signs of wear/damage even though we had to gate check them on one leg. Only had the chance to use once, but I think they'll hold up for a long time for us infrequent travelers.",

It also went on sale for nearly half the price and Amazon does not do price adjustments or price matching. The new case I received seems better quality overall and the purple paint a bit brighter and evenly coated. Will give it a try!I need to replace me carryon luggage now that the one I\u2019ve used for years is no longer considered carryon. This one seemed hopeful after others I\u2019ve seen in stores and ordered/returned seemed flimsy. I ordered the purple one and it had a bit of discoloration like bleach was dropped on it.Although it seems roomy to fit shoes & clothes for a long weekend, the material for the liner and strap w/ clip aren't the best quality. When you unzip the liner from the hard side of case there is a thin foam lining. Waiting for a different brand I ordered for comparison but may keep this one since it seems to hold the right amount for a couple of days use. Pretty lightweight too.",

As a result, I don\u2019t expect a suitcase to last more than a dozen trips, at most. I have high hopes for this Rockland Melbourne Hardside bag, though. It is relatively inexpensive, but seems sturdy. Zipper closures seem good quality, and the bag looks terrific. As a carry-on, it should survive for a while, which would be great. If checked as baggage, well, that is a question! There is no reason why it should not hold up well.",

Bought 2 specifically for travel on Delta because it claims they fit and reviews said they had no issues using them as carry on (without expansion). I had ordered a different brand straight from the company that claims they are carry on but thank goodness I found out before heading to the airport that they were not small enough for Delta. Can\u2019t return them because of their crazy strict return policy (Biaggi). So Amazon here we are.Got the red and the grey with blue trim. No issues with grey one. Looks nice, everything functions well. A little tippy when empty. I\u2019ll give more detailed review once we\u2019ve used them.Red one was packaged differently so I\u2019m assuming it was returned because inside was pink. That didn\u2019t matter to me but the expansion zipper catches and is very difficult to get it started to open. I\u2019d expect it will eventually break. (All zippers on the other bag work great so I doubt it\u2019s a design flaw.) Also a thick string was unraveling at top of bag near zipper so afraid something will come apart. I\u2019m returning it. I wanted to do an exchange to a different color but after I said which I wanted and marked the appropriate boxes continue was still greyed out. I had to click return and then go back and buy again. Why offer exchange if it won\u2019t let us. Tried to search \u201cexchange\u201d but got no result.Original two were delivered 1 and 2 days after ordered. Replacement is taking a week? Replacement is $6 more and is silver with black trim. No clue of inside color.",

Her name is Petunia and in the event she has to be checked, she will be easily spotted as not many suitcases are this color. :) I can fit four days' worth of clothing in here, three if I have to have two pairs of shoes. It came with an airline approved TSA lock. Inside there is one half that is fully zippered, which zips the wrong way in my opinion, but it zips closed. The other side has a small, zippered pouch on the side, and it has clothes straps. It does expand if necessary and the expansion zipper is different that the regular zipper! Makes it so much easier to know which zipper to use. The wheels are nice and roll easily over many different kinds of ground. There are two different levels of extension for the handle, and I was able to attach my bag around it and roll it with no issues. The price was awesome as I got this on a Prime day sale.",
