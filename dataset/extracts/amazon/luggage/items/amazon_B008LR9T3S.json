                "reviewText": "So far so good. There are pros and cons. I would say for the price it is a good choice.Pros:It looks as pictured and is very sturdy, and spacious. 360 degree rotation. Moves smoothly.Cons:There are two issues: 1. The zip inside broke after two travels. It is still holding there that if you zip it very carefully it can still be closed. 2. If you put too much comparatively heavy stuff on the pull handle side, you won't be able to pull out the handle all the way because it is stuck.",

                "reviewText": "I like having a bag that is easy to spot when in a sea of other bags. I like hard sided luggage and it seems to be more protective to the contents. This bag is a bit smaller than my last carry on but I have noticed that carry on requirements are getting smaller and many airlines are being much more vigilant about checking. I have used it a couple of times and have actually had to check it due to overcrowding in the overhead storage. It has got a few scrapes already but to significant damage.",

I worried about checking it, but it came through fine 6 times now. The lock only lasted 1 trip before it jammed. Twist-ties work great! Wheels are good. The bag is great for a weekend. Packing for longer than 3 days was tough and I needed an additional carry on for tennis shoes and toiletries. The bad is these shells do not have outside pockets like a soft case and I missed those pockets for chargers, books, boarding pass, etc.",
