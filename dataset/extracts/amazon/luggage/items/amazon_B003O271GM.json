                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this suitcase for my last trip, and let me tell you, it exceeded all my expectations! This luggage is an absolute game-changer when it comes to convenience, durability, and organization during travel.First and foremost, the build quality is outstanding. The 1200D 2-tone polyester with PVC backing ensures that the luggage can withstand the rigors of travel without showing any signs of wear and tear. No matter how rough the handling, this luggage remained in pristine condition, which gives me the confidence that it will last for many more trips to come.The interior retractable handle with the push-button mechanism is a small yet highly appreciated feature. It makes maneuvering through crowded airports and busy streets a breeze. The handle locks firmly into place, providing a sturdy grip without any wobbling or instability.One of the standout features of this luggage is undoubtedly the inline skate wheels with corner protectors. These wheels glide effortlessly, even on uneven surfaces, allowing me to navigate through airports with minimal effort. The corner protectors have proven to be a lifesaver, preventing any scuffs or damage that could potentially occur during baggage handling.Inside, I found the full lined interior to be quite spacious, providing ample room for all my belongings. The large zipper pockets are perfect for organizing smaller items, while the compression straps keep everything secure and in place. No more rummaging through my suitcase to find things\u2014I can easily access whatever I need with ease.As for the size, the 29\u201d H x 17\u201d W x 10\u201d D (expanding to 12 in. D) measurements are spot-on. It's roomy enough to hold a week's worth of clothes and essentials, yet it still fits comfortably in overhead compartments on airplanes.In conclusion, the suitcase is an outstanding travel companion that I highly recommend to anyone in need of reliable and functional luggage. Its durability, easy handling, and well-designed interior make it worth every penny. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase, and I'm already looking forward to my next adventure with this fantastic piece of luggage by my side!",

                "reviewText": "I own this bag in red. I purchased it about six years ago and have average about 4 trips per year with it. I am currently shopping for its replacement.Let me explain the things I love about it. I bought this as part of a patched set and appreciate this in my search of the baggage carousel. The bag\u2019s construction is sturdy and the contents are well protected. There are cubbies or pouches in the most protected corners for safe storage of breakables; they WORK. It is spacious enough to hold a week\u2019s worth of hanging clothes and still have room for everything else I need on a weeklong trip (shoes, toiletries, small clothes, chargers/cables, etc.). The interior shows no wear after 6 years of use all internal parts work as well today as the day I bought it. The telescoping handle is sturdy enough to work well with this bag and a carry-on bag attached to it. It extends to a comfortable height and does a good job controlling the bag while rushing to make a flight. The wheels likewise are large enough to roll well, even in the under-construction airports & airport parking lots which seem to litter our continent. This handle telescoped completely and stores inside a zippered pocket. This garment bag came with handles, a should strap, and the telescoping handle.Here are the things I would change about this piece of luggage. The design is such that when it falls over, it always false face down on the only colorful part of the bag. It makes the luggage one more anonymous black bag on the airport carousel. This also puts the most textured and decorative portion of the bag the side baggage handlers use to slide the bag, which has resulted in much wear and actual tear to the \u201cNice\u201d side of the bag. The first trip I used the bag the shoulder strap broke. Looking at it later, the swivel snap portion seemed to be formed from a lesser quality metal than the other pieces of the strap and this is what broke. In all fairness I believe this was a quality control error made by the subcontractor from whom they purchased the hardware and not a reflection on Travel Select\u2019s design or manufacture.I have used this bag more than any other in the set. I use it for business travel and vacation travel. It is more worn than any other piece in the set, as is should be. The positives far outweigh the negatives, and it is my \u201cGo-to\u201d luggage. If I could, I would change a few things about this garment bag. They are making this bag for a variety of people with a variety of needs and travel styles, so I would not try to correct the balance issue with the bag falling on its \u201cFace\u201d. I would make the entire bag the same color on all sides, I would select a less textured clothe (while it looks great, it snags on everything in baggage handling), make the metal tubing of the collapsible handle one gauge thicker, and add a check of hardware quality before using it on the luggage. In my current search for a replacement, I may end up buying a new copy of what I already own.",

                "reviewText": "It is so hard to find a 2-wheel carry-on these days, with the rugged embedded wheels instead of those ridiculous flimsy spinning wheels that most bags have these days.This is the perfect design for what I was seeking. It has rugged wheels, to get down the sidewalk and cobblestones, and the wheels are inset so that you get the maximum amount of storage for the carry-on size. The color options are fun as well so you can find it in the sea of black cases. It expands nicely and has a nice useful layout of pockets. And, it is incredibly lightweight! And the price was very attractive.The only drawback is that it does not feel that it is going to hold up for very long. I've had this for about six months (traveled with it about a half dozen times). So far, it is fully in tact. The vinyl handles are tearing but they seem like they might be reinforced under the vinyl tear so they may hold up even if they look like they will fall off. The retractable handle seems flimsy but has not broken. Because it is so lightweight, the shape of the case isn't overly rigid and can get a little distorted if you are pushing it to capacity (it can feel a little like a duffle bag at times).Overall, I really like this bag but durability is a concern.",
