He absolutely loves this thing. He ran this up and down the hallways of a hotel, around the room, all over the place. And because it has a hard cover, we didn't have to worry about him damaging the contents of the bag.Only sticking point is it came with a protective film over it. It mostly came off easy, but be aware because you don't want your kid playing with a big piece of plastic or putting little plastic pieces in their mouth.",
