                "reviewText": "I wish there was a 4.9 rating. Light, good looking, holds a lot for the size, I can fill it and still get it into the overhead bin (67 years old). Great price when I bought it. AND why did they put a little zipper over the pull handle. Sure it looks better but mostly I'll just have it flapping around as I need to put the handle up and down a lot. And if they were going to do that, why not purple fabric in there instead of gray. So I'm going to modify it by hand sewing the flap closed under the handle. I shouldn't have to do that.",

The handle started to rip from the bag after a year. The outer zipper pockets are a tight fit when full. Would be nice to have a laptop sleeve or the clothing straps inside. The clear zipper pouch inside and the 2 inner pockets for shoes were very handy. It did the job, but will look for better features with the next one. The wheels and extending handle held up great.",

I was in the middle and this worked perfectly fitting under the seat in front of me. Returning I was on an aisle seat in a large plane and on a small plane. It did not fit under the seat in front of me on either one. Just be aware it won\u2019t fit under seats on all the planes.The bag itself worked well, easy to pack, loved the ability to pull vs carry. Held what I needed it to hold and held up well.",

                "reviewText": "fast delivery and great customer service. Room inside was larger than I thought. It really held alot of luggage. 2 main zipped compartments and a front document/magazine compartment. Separate little pockets inside and a plastic velcro closing pocket for wet/dirty laundry. I also loved the 2 mesh pockets on either side. I just came back from 3 weeks in the USA and it was so easy with this as carry on luggage. It will fit under the seat, but u need to put your feet on it as it does take up all the room on the floor. The extendable handle was strong and easy to maneuver and folds down away out of sight when not in use and can be carried by the handles. Wheels were sturdy. This bag went through 7 flights I carried 5 outfit changes, shoes, meds, 3 magazines, 2 puzzle books, travel documents, snacks, water (in the side mesh pocket) and still had room for more. This bag still looks as good as new after coming home and unpacking. Highly recommend this travel bag.",
