Finally, after 36 years, one of the zippers was beginning to fail. Can't help but be loyal to the brand after that performance.This one looks great, is a bit lighter in weight, is composed of sturdier material, and the wheels rotate.If this one lasts 36 years, I'm probably no longer around so I'll put it in my will and one of my nieces/nephews is going to end up with a very good suitcase.",

                "reviewText": "The travel case was damaged on the very first trip from NYC to SFO after receiving it. The support is very helpful, providing a replacement without any questions asked under warranty. The second one has been used for another month with a couple of international and domestic travels and is still in good shape only with normal wearing and scratches. It is very lightweight with smooth wheels on the bottom. Zippers are pretty strong when fully packed. The color is very special and can be easily identified at the airport. Highly recommended.",
