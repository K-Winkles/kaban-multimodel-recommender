It broke after a single trip. There are better quality luggages that are just slightly more expensive.There are no options to refund or return the item either, nor can I find information on a warranty. Wish it didn't break so easily, or at least there was some kind of way to get it fixed. It is so pretty. I love the design and look, too bad it's not durable in the slightest.",
