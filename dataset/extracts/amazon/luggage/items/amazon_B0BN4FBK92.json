                "reviewText": "After 22 years, the handle on my trusty Samsonite rolling garment bag (of identical dimensions and form-factor of this item) finally broke. The warranty on that bag was for 10 years, so a 22-year run was amazing.I purchased this bag to replace it, and I have no confidence that this bag will last anywhere near as long.- The skid plate across the bottom that protects the bag when dragged off of a curb or baggage cart is gone from the new model. I expect the cloth on the wheel side of the bag to fray and wear through.- The skid plates that protect the wheels from damage on baggage conveyor belts are gone.- The main handle is now just a piece of cloth rather than a solid handle. I had to wrap it in a pad so that it was not painful to carry.- The telescoping handle is now 3 inches shorter. The bag now hits the heals of my shoes as I walk with it and I have to crouch down while rolling it.- The interior \"shoulder\" pockets are much smaller and less padded and can no longer fit a shoe inside. In the older bag these pockets were ideal for carrying fragile items wrapped up in padding, inside a shoe, and inside a reinforced corner. They are much less secure now.- The wheels are of a smaller diameter and look to be less sturdy.- The zipper pulls are all smaller and the zippers themselves are less substantial and are thin plastic like you would find on a gym bag. Other reviews have noted that the zippers can break, so I am being extremely careful with them.The overall formfactor of this bag remains fantastic, but I expect to have to replace it again in just a few years, making it not a good value. There are other similar bags now, and I will likely shop other brands for my next purchase as the quality that Samsonite had at the turn of the millennium is just no longer there.",

This one was the closest I could find to my old one. The quality is not as good as the old one, but that\u2019s true of most things. It survived a two week trip, so I\u2019m happy with it.",
