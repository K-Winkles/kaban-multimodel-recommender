                "reviewText": "Two are small enough to carry on. The other two for checked baggage. I don't recommend taking both a roller carry on and checked bag though hard to pull everything through the airport and any shuttles. I used all but the largest on my last trip. Next time will skip the roller carry on and put more in my checked bag. I was worried about lost luggage and my computer last time. But it was hard going up and down escalators on Phoenix for the sky train with all that.",

What I don't like is when it's packed it doesn't stay upright on it's own. It's constantly falling over and it has gotten so dirty because of this issue but at least the fabric didn't tear. I also would have preferred it wheels that swivel in all directions but that's my fault for not reading the description properly. The inside material does feel cheap compared to my last suitcase. Overall, would I recommend this to a friend? No. Is it nice for the cost? Yeah. Take what you will with this review.",
