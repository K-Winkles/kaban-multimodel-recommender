                "reviewText": "My daughter and I were going to Vegas (from Seattle) and wanted light weight suitcases that we didn\u2019t have to drag behind us. I wanted them to have a cool pattern or color so we could find them, and I didn\u2019t want to pay more than $100-$200. I decided to try hard side luggage because they are easy to wipe off and soft side seem to get front heavy when packed to the max. This pattern was exactly what I as looking for and the set of 3 was on sale! Do they expand or have TSA locks? No! But that\u2019s the trade off I made to have cool looking luggage for $120! The wheels worked best/fastest on smooth surfaces and OK on carpet. They survived the trip fine with a few minor scuffs that could be rubbed off. I think they will be fine for the occasional domestic trip but we plan to splurge on something sturdier when we go to Europe.",
