                "reviewText": "I did not want to write a review on this until I actually took it on a plane it had it checked I got the small and larger 24 hard shell this trip to Arizona I only used the larger one I was scared since my last trip to Florida my suitcase was totally dented in brand new it was some American brand I was super disappointed because it was gorgeous luggage but let me tell you I fit everything I needed for over a week of travel in my check bag of course you always get a few scrapes and rubs on your suitcases no matter what because you know how the airline people are but it cleaned off really great no dents not a single dent I was so surprised!!! how long will it hold up I don't know? I'll keep you posted as I use it I only had the wheel get caught up once and I'm not even sure why it got caught more than likely uneven pavement I was in such a rush I didn't really pay attention. I'm a tiny bit worried about the zippers I didn't overpack by any means I didn't go cheap cuz I really just wanted a good set that I wouldn't have to go buy another one. The zippers to me just looked a little stretched but I think it's the way the zipper for the extender is made. So, far so good I'll take some pictures of what it looks like after this first trip as you can see with a toothbrush and a little bit of arm power I was able to get most of the dirt from them throwing it in and on the plane off still a few little scrapes here and there but that's to be expected with any luggage. In a perfect world the airport people would have more time and maybe wouldn't be so rough on the luggage but always in a hurry on this Earth so spending a little more to have a durable set was worth it. As you can see I was able to get all of that scummy looks like from underneath the plane off with a toothbrush my luggage looks almost brand new again a few Marks here and there but nothing that is serious and no damage it held up well so as of right now for its first trip it was a tough little cookie as I said.Also one final thing the color some say get darker because it won't show the dirt but everybody has dark luggage let me tell you this purple I knew right away that it was my bag there's not many purples this color so it was very very easy to find my bag when I was on a plane of about 350 people.I'll keep you updated I have a few more trips this year and we'll see how she holds up this one and the little one I don't write reviews ever so I only did this because I spent hours looking for luggage and I mean hours and days and months after my last disappointment so I want people who are on the fence about this luggage to know that it's definitely is durable you can't beat that there is insurance on it that if it does get broke it will be taken care of as of right now I'm very happy with my investment hopefully as time goes on it will stay I gave it five stars because it did everything that I needed it to do at least for this size and this trip hopefully my stars will say the same when I use the little one",
