All three luggage pieces have so many secret compartments especially the smallest one. I cannot wait to take this on my vacation. And the smaller one also has wheels too so you can pull that one in case you don't want to carry it. The two bigger ones also comes with their own separate keys but the biggest one key sticks a little bit, but I figured out you just have to jiggle it a little bit and it will unlock. I would recommend you get this set for this price it will blow your mind.",

If you a heavy packer I don\u2019t suggest getting this suitcase because not only the material is cheap it will cause you to overweight at the airport when checking your suitcase out.",

I asked Amazon to make an exception, and give me a cost free return and they would not. If you decide to but this, prepare to make it one trip, maybe, and then replacing this item.",

                "reviewText": "First impression visual: This is really cute, and I like the leopard print. As a rule of thumb animal print tends to look cheap, but this is a little understated and nice. Texture of exterior is nice canvas feel.What you get: There are three pieces, a large check in, a smaller carry on, and the 22\" duffle bag. The duffle actually has wheels and a handle that pulls out. The duffle is heavy enough that you will likely need to use this feature when it is loaded. I missed that in the reviews and am disappointed as I thought it'd be a cute light weight duffle for more daily use.Quality of product: Most important to know: The material is backed by plastic coating, but overall is rather thin. My suspicion is anything of weight being tossed onto it will cause a puncture. Also, the interior frame structure is minimal at best. I can absolutely see all three of these bags getting destroyed by ground crew. I like the look of it and the interior storage is ok. Since I bought as an Amazon return for only $53 I actually considered adding heavy corrugated plastic to the back of the back behind the zipper to help avoid punctures.Overall Assessment: This should work as a car trip set, but I am concerned about it holding up to baggage handlers. I am considering returning as I bought for upcoming flight and already have car trip luggage.",
