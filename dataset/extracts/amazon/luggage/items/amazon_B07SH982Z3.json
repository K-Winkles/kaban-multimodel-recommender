The handle will also break, if you fill it up with laptops, full bottles of liquid and stuff above the typical 40 lb of a cabin bag. But if you use it according to its purpose I seriously doubt you'll have any issues. It's a really nicely looking suitcase, easy to move around, the cup holder is so fun to use for a water bottle or a coffee cup (with a lid), while I have not plugged a battery in yet to test if/how it will look mounting my phone there. For the price, it's a really good deal. Just go on and buy it!",

The strap on the small bag was sewn on wrong and could not be untwisted straight. Wheels are not smooth rolling like some of my other 4 wheel bags. Nice size and light and sides expand somewhat like a canvas bag.",

Cupholder works great, but it doesn't come with the charger. Although, I was able to find a 2 pack of portable chargers on Amazon for $20!I also bought 2 (found a gently used navy color for $40), so my daughter and I match. \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c",

I can't tell you how many people stopped me to ask where I got these bags. Also, they are incredibly easy to roll along the floors and walkways. So convenient! They are sturdy and I would highly recommend them to anyone.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Fails to Deliver on Promises",
                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set with Cup Holder and USB Port in Olive Green, specifically the 20-Inch Carry-On model, with high hopes of a convenient and reliable travel companion. However, after using this luggage extensively, I can confidently say that it was a regrettable purchase. This thorough and detailed review aims to provide honest and unbiased feedback to potential buyers, highlighting the product's shortcomings and explaining why it fails to meet expectations. While I understand that experiences may vary, I believe it is important to share my personal encounter to help others make informed decisions.Design and Build Quality:The first impression of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set was underwhelming. The olive green color appeared faded and lacked vibrancy, giving an overall cheap look. The material used in the construction of the luggage felt flimsy, and I had concerns about its durability even before my first trip. The zippers, handles, and wheels seemed poorly made, which raised doubts about their longevity.Functionality:The primary selling points of this luggage set are the built-in cup holder and USB port. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be more of a gimmick than practical additions. The cup holder is positioned on the side of the luggage, making it almost impossible to access when the bag is upright. Additionally, it lacks stability, causing drinks to spill easily, posing a risk to valuable belongings. As for the USB port, it was a complete disappointment. The charging function was unreliable, frequently disconnecting, and providing inconsistent power output. It is frustrating to have a luggage with such features that do not work as intended.Storage Capacity:The 20-Inch Carry-On model promised ample storage space. However, the design of the interior compartments was inefficient. The main compartment lacked dividers or organizing pockets, making it difficult to separate and locate items quickly. The flimsy lining tore after minimal use, compromising the overall structure of the luggage. Furthermore, the external pockets were not deep enough to accommodate larger items securely. The storage capacity did not live up to its claims, leading to constant reorganization and difficulty in packing efficiently.Maneuverability:One would expect a 20-inch carry-on to be easy to maneuver. Unfortunately, the wheels on the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set were a constant source of frustration. They lacked smooth rotation, often getting stuck or veering in awkward directions. Pushing or pulling the luggage required excessive effort, resulting in unnecessary strain during travel. The telescopic handle was loose and wobbly, adding to the overall inconvenience. Moving through busy airports or crowded streets became a tiresome task, and I found myself longing for a more reliable and effortless experience.Durability and Longevity:The build quality of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set did not inspire confidence in its long-term durability. During my first trip, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the exterior, suggesting poor resistance to rough handling. The wheels showed signs of wear and tear after minimal use, making me question their ability to withstand long journeys. The handle mechanism felt weak and unstable, leading me to worry about its potential failure in the future. Considering the price point of this luggage set, I expected a product that would withstand the rigors of travel, but sadly, it fell short in this aspect.Customer Service and Warranty:When I reached out to the customer service department regarding the issues I faced with my Wrangler Smart Luggage Set, I experienced further disappointment. Their response time was slow, taking days to reply to my initial query. Furthermore, their solutions were unsatisfactory, merely suggesting basic troubleshooting steps without addressing the specific concerns I had raised. The warranty provided was limited and did not cover several aspects of the product. It was evident that the company's commitment to customer satisfaction was lacking, leaving me feeling unsupported and frustrated.1. Security Concerns: Another aspect worth mentioning is the lack of security features in the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set. While it does come with a standard lock, it felt flimsy and provided minimal protection. The overall structure of the luggage did not inspire confidence in keeping belongings secure during travel. The absence of any additional security measures, such as TSA-approved locks or reinforced zippers, raises concerns about the safety of valuable items.2. Weight Distribution Issues: During my travels, I noticed significant weight distribution issues with this luggage set. Evenly distributing the weight across the wheels proved to be a challenge, resulting in imbalanced handling. This imbalance not only affected maneuverability but also caused the luggage to topple over easily, especially when navigating uneven surfaces or while in transit. It was frustrating to constantly struggle with a luggage that lacked stability.3. Inadequate Padding and Protection: The Wrangler Smart Luggage Set provided insufficient padding and protection for delicate items. The thin lining and lack of additional cushioning left items vulnerable to damage during transit. I found myself having to be overly cautious and packing extra layers of padding to ensure the safety of my belongings. For a product marketed as a smart luggage set, the lack of adequate protection was a significant disappointment.4. Limited Color Options: While personal preference may vary, it is worth noting that the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set offered limited color options. The olive green color, which I opted for, appeared dull and unattractive in person. It would have been beneficial to have a wider range of colors to choose from, allowing customers to select an option that suits their personal style and preferences.5. Price Point and Value for Money: Considering the price point of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set, it is crucial to evaluate its value for money. Unfortunately, this product falls short in terms of quality, functionality, and durability, making it an unsatisfactory investment. There are alternative luggage options available in the market that offer better features, sturdier build quality, and superior customer support within a similar price range.Conclusion:In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set with Cup Holder and USB Port, Olive Green, 20-Inch Carry-On to anyone seeking reliable, functional, and durable luggage. From the poor design and build quality to the lack of functionality, this product falls short on multiple fronts. The storage capacity is inefficient, maneuverability is subpar, and the promised features like the cup holder and USB port are more hassle than convenience. Moreover, the questionable durability, coupled with disappointing customer service, further diminishes its value. I highly recommend exploring other options that offer better quality and functionality within a similar price range.",
