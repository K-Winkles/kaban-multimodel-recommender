I have a trip coming up soon, and will definitely use it then. It's comes with a 2 year warranty. Again, I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The customer service was very helpful, patient and understanding. I couldn't figure out how to reset the combination on my new luggage, so I had to email them for help. They made sure I was got the combination reset, by sending a video with instruction. I will recommend this luggage to my family and friends.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am a frequent business traveler who has seen many a suitcase destroyed through typical use. I resisted the spinny style for many years, having seen plenty returned to people with wheels broken off. I couldn't count the number of hardside bags I've seen cracked, punctured, split, you name it. And those results aren't just on checked bags, I've seen them come out of the plane's overhead bin with damages. Who wants to arrive on a trip and have to deal with broken luggage?I don't, which is why I resisted getting either a spinny or a hard sider and yet here I am having ordered my first hard-sided spinny! Part of the draw was it is my favorite color, purple. Remember, while black may 'go with everything', it is also very easy for the hundreds of other travelers at the airport to mistake your black bag for theirs, even with that cute red bow you tied to the handle. They tied one too. Or thought they did, or thought it fell off, or....you get the picture. I recommend luggage that is NOT black if you want to make your travel easier.The bag overall feels very light. The zipper pulls have a curved shape I've never seen before, perhaps meant to be ergonomic in some way. They're novel for sure, long and easy to grip. The wheels feel sturdy, roll smoothly, and turn easily.There is a TSA-compliant lock feature for the zipper but I haven't tried it out yet. I don't feel the need to lock a bag unless I'm leaving it with a concierge.I really like the zippered section and how the divider itself has individual zippered pockets on it. The cord for attaching to a power bank is included but you must supply your own power bank. For the section without the zippered divider there are elastic straps that clasp together to hold items on that side in place.The handle feels strong. It has three height settings, the lowest feels most comfortable for me at 5'4\". You will notice some plastic still on the handles in the vid, I'm one of those folks who doesn't take wrappings that aren't in my way completely off until I have to.I think this is a very pretty and well-designed suitcase. I plan to use it as a carryon.",

                "reviewText": "Summer will bring vacation time, and my work will be sending me off for training too, and honestly my old luggage is looking pretty rough. It was time for an upgrade. This is the carry-on size of this case, from this manufacturer, and it looks like it will be a great travel item.It arrived in a sturdy box, and inside of that was this hardshell case with instruction tags affixed to the handle.The exterior is a hard-shell poly or plastic material that looks like it will be quite durable. There are two handles, one on top and one on the side give you carry options, and there is a retractable handle for toting/ rolling the case through the airport.The wheels all of the spinner type, as in they all caster so it doesn't matter which side is up, or what direction you go, they will follow smoothly. When closed, the outer zipper pull-tabs line up with a built in TSA accessible lock to secure your belongings. It is a 3-digit combination lock that you can program to your own personal combination.Inside there is the main compartment for clothing, which can be secured with elastic straps. On the lid side there are two small pouches, to store electronics, papers, personal items etc... One of which is a mesh pouch with a usb type cord inside which passes through to an exterior port in the hard shell for charging or connecting to your electronics stored inside. The lining that the pouches are attached to also unzips giving you access to even more storage in the lid.I believe with careful packing there is plenty of storage for possibly up to a weeks' worth of travel in this one compact case. (But I tend to travel light)As I mentioned I haven't traveled with it yet, so I will return at a later time to update this review after I've had a chance to test it out in the real world, but my first impression is, that this should be a decent and durable case.",
