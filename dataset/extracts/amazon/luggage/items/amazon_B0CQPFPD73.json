The locks are an included bonus built into the case and if you want to bring back souvenirs that not a problem because the bag can expand. I am known for bringing back more than I left with.

It has a custom adjustment telescopic handle that can be raised or lowered an inch at a time. This luggage is expandable (width) to about 1 inch. I measured it to be approximately 15 x 10 x 21 in. case dimensions (excluding wheels in height). I also weighed the luggage to be about 7.7 pounds (empty weight) - it is light which i really like. It has 4 dual spinner wheels one for each corner that makes this luggage \"glide\" with a little push. It also has a \"TSA approved\" locking mechanism. I googled on how to set your personal combination - very easy to set it up. Opening the luggage you will see an ample room for your belongings - it has a lot of pockets and all zippers are all \"fine-tooth\" and closes smooth and flushed. Has a wet pack pocket for your toiletries. And there's more.... it has a 10 year manufacturer's warranty. I had Samsonites before and it seems they are \"indestructible\" they last a long time with regular handling. I wished they could have put a protective rib on the underside when you lay it down to open the luggage - but not a deal breaker for me. I consider this luggage very classy!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve ordered my fair share of Amazon suitcases, and maybe it\u2019s obvious, but you get what you pay for. I love the Samsonite brand and have had several over the years. The quality is obvious from first glance and to every detail. This suitcase comes with a 10-year warranty, just to back that up.In terms of features, the hard shell is really strong and solid, even though the suitcase is very lightweight. The spinner wheels glide effortlessly and spin easily in every direction. The handle is adjustable to many different heights so you can customize it for you. The inside has a newer design compression strap that is really interesting. And also the standard zip closure side also features a built in waterproof toiletry section. Super convenient. The built in TSA lock and expandable zipper are also nice features. I can\u2019t think of anything else I would want in a carry on suitcase.I also love the cream and brown design which looks really high end. I also ordered the matching Virtuosa backpack which coordinates beautifully.My only caution is that this suitcase is carry on sized for most US carriers but probably wouldn\u2019t pass on international carriers or airlines that are super strict\u2014with wheels it\u2019s 23\u201d tall. So if you\u2019re team carry on only and hate a gate check, just be certain the measurements will work for you.",

                "reviewText": "This Virtuoso Samsonite carryon is a nice bag. The wheels spin easily in all directions, and the construction gives you the benefits of hard-sided luggage (more resistant to rips and tears) while retaining some of the benefits of soft-sided luggage (it has the ability to expand, thanks to a zipper in the middle).The inside of the bag is lined, and it has zippered compartments for small (and liquid) items. The compartments also serve to divide the two sides of the luggage. There are the usual straps so you can secure your items.In general, I am pleased. Since this is an early example of the Virtuosa line, it's not clear whether you will be able to find other bags to match this one. The other big question is that of price. Some places charge double what I have seen it at others. So be sure to shop around before buying it.",

                "reviewText": "Well I broke my rule with this one! I was firm believer in only getting luggage in a dark color. I know I will need to pack my magic erasers, but I simply could not resist the elegant and upscale look of this luggage. The tan color is beautiful.It arrives locked so know the code is 000 to unlock. It would be nice if the tag describing it was hung on the outside of the bag, instead of safely locked away! Lol! We had to look up the item on amazon to learn how to get into it. But... this is my first piece of luggage with a built in lock system. Perhaps they all arrive this way?The wheels seem to be secure and sturdy. Glides effortlessly.The inside is roomy with the added expander option. There is a removable plastic pocket for toiletries.Overall we are pleased with it. I have never had a hard case suitcase before and am curious if I will miss the outside pockets. I think for short getaways this will be perfect.Time to book that trip!",
