I got the black animal print and it looks great. Each piece comes with keys but I would suggest buying your own locks and keys . keys were very light nd work on all pieces but I would not trust the key and locks while traveling on trains or planes. I worried that the inside lining was too thin but I have packed them, Stuffed them and they came through fine . I am on a tight budget and the price was amazing for a 4 piece set with tons of room, expandable tops on the three suitcases and I can tell you the reaction of others seeing them was shock because they do look high end. the only minus really was that I could not get each piece to stand up without me holding it up",

                "reviewText": "Bought this luggage set for a job out West that lasted 6 months. Luggage pieces are very roomy as I had to fit clothes for very cold & very hot weather. By the time my heavyweight and lightweight clothes were packed, luggage was pretty heavy as I don't pack light.Wheels worked decently enough and I have to say as heavy as my clothes were, they rolled with no problem. Handles are pretty durable and lasted through the 6 months without any breakage. Zippers could use improving as they held up, but very flimsy. All pieces came back with little to no wear and held up pretty good, I'm hoping the zippers last for a few more trips though.All in All pretty happy with purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased the two piece Rockland leopard set. I loved that little set so much that I decided to purchase the matching 4 piece set and a backpack to use it for my airport travels. It hasn't been tested out at the airport, yet but if it's anything like my two piece set, it will hold up well. Of course, that really depends on the luggage handlers. I know it will be super easy to spot on the conveyer belt because I haven't seen any other luggage in this particular style.Word of warning. Do NOT get the Rockland leopard set that has pink on it. That set is cheaply made and the pull up retracting handle gets stuck A LOT. This set is not like that set. It's better made and much smoother. :))",

                "reviewText": "We bought this set for a six-week trip to Europe. For the price we weren't expecting it to last years. It didn't even survive the first week.Both of the larger checked bags were broken by the time we landed, specifically the handles and frames. The largest suitcase handle and support frame snapped in half inside the suitcase rendering the whole thing unusable. We had to buy a new one for a premium at our destination. The next one broke with the handle stuck down, so while we could still use it, we had to pull it around with a luggage strap which was FAR from ideal on cobbled streets.In general the suitcases are awkward, unbalanced, and heavy. Buy literally anything else besides this. I am livid that I can't get a refund for this garbage.",

Just clothes.Looking at other more expensive luggage which is heavier and just a bit more durable, I would recommend this set and simply replace it after say 20 trips. I find that buying expensive stuff and expecting it to last for life is wishful thinking. Also forget out warranties and insurance, the claim is typically denied for all kinds of BS excuses. Spend as little as necessary and hope for the best.p.s. I see people always grabbing others luggage ... not mine. :-)",
