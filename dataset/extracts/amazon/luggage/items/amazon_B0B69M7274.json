                "reviewText": "Good quality. None of the wheels came off. Very light when unpacked. Handle easily goes up and down. Zipped up and expanded easily. The front pocket is more for a tablet. I could barely fit my work laptop in it. A slim laptop might work. Overall good value for less than $100. Fits in overhead bin easily.",

I don\u2019t know what kind of laptop they have but mine is a 15\" and it fits perfectly as does my charging bank.It rolls so smoothly.And then there\u2019s that adorable extra case for make up, hair products, and anything else you need to put in there. and according to the product description, it\u2019s the perfect size to slide up under the seat in front of you.If I do have end up having issues, I will post an update.",

I bought it because of the front flap that can hold all co outer type devices plus passport etc. This way I do not ever have to go into the main section to put back. A laptop and ter clearing security in the airport. Other beloved features - combo lock with TSA access. Connection to a power bank so I can charge the phone without having to go on a manhunt for a plug. The second bag is good for the small loose articles and can sub as a soiled or wet clothes bag or makeup and personal items carrying case. The luggage piece travels well and with ease over the surfaces. Definitely a good purchase so far",

It also expands which I wanted so I could purchase a few souvenirs. At first I loved the little vanity case. However, reality is it doesn\u2019t hold too much. I\u2019ll use it for an shorter trip when I can share space in my suitcase for hair straighteners, etc. it\u2019s durable, and rolls easy with four wheels. Light weight. I put the zippers to the test as I needed the expansion. Held up great! I recommend this case.",
