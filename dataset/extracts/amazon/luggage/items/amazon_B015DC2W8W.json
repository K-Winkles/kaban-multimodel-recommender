The color I wanted wasn't available in the 28\" size, but yellow was along with a carry on bag (for the same price). I took it on a flight soon after purchase and it held up well, VERY well as they do get tossed around a bit. Plus it's lightweight, and with the spinner wheels, perfect! Plenty of room for a one week stay and I am very happy with this. And the color! Love the yellow.",

                "reviewText": "Effet de surprise r\u00e9ussi, cadeau tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 par le receveur surtout pour les 4 roulettes pour chaque valise au lieu de deux roulettes comme les modems standards. 1 valise 28\u2019\u2019 (suite \u00e0 bagage) et 1 valise 20\u2019\u2019 (bagage \u00e0 main) qui semblent correspondre aux normes des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens. J\u2019adore le fait que le m\u00e9canisme de poign\u00e9e r\u00e9tractable soit principalement \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la valise et laisse plus d\u2019espace int\u00e9rieur. Possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter un cadenas par l\u2019ourlet combin\u00e9 des deux fermetures \u00e9claires (zippers). Possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019agrandir ou r\u00e9duire l\u2019espace de rangement avec une fermeture \u00e9claire suppl\u00e9mentaire. 5 ans de garantie si je me fis a l\u2019\u00e9tiquette.",
