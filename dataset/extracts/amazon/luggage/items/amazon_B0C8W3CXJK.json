                "reviewText": "Don't get me wrong - it is a very nice piece of luggage and I look forward to taking it on our next flight because the dimensions are ideal for using as a carry-on for our specialty shirts and ears for Disney trips. The quality is fantastic, the look is sleek, stylish, and easy to carry, and the lining is silky yet durable. The handle extends to multiple lengths, which is perfect for anyone, and is very comfortable to carry or wheel behind you. The personalized lock combination is also easy to set. It is an excellent piece of well constructed, durable luggage and will absolutely be well loved and well used. However, if this same piece of luggage had an unknown name on it, it would probably be about $95 less. I am someone who does usually gravitate towards well known brands, so that isn't a complaint - just stating the obvious for the sake of an honest review. I love this bag and if you are looking for a well made carry on with a well known name behind it, this is for you! (The deduction of one star is strictly due to the price.)",

                "reviewText": "I love that this little carry-on bag is actually small enough for under-seat storage. So often these rolling bags aren't small enough to go under the seat in front, so they have to be stored in the overhead bin. This one is very compact and truly is small enough for under-seat storage. So if you're traveling and end up on the plane and there's no overhead space, this will tuck right under the seats. So you should be forced to pay to check the bag. It's about the size of a backpack.It's hard sided, but the sides have the look and texture that make it appear like a sift sided nylon. I like this, because I'm personally don't love the shiny/glossy hard sided bags. This one looks soft sided, but is actually hard sided.There are two main compartments. The front pocket opens in a way that it folds outward. The second is the main and largest compartment that's a large open space for all your items. The smaller pocket has a very well padded slot inside that's a good size for a laptop or tablet. I tested it with my laptops and the largest one I could fit into the front pocket slot was my HP 15 inch laptop. So it will comfortably fit a 15 inch computer.Wheels roll smoothly and the telescoping handle on the back is strong. Very happy with the design and how they were able to make a carry-on style bag in a under-seat storage size.",

                "reviewText": "I love this suitcase. It is really well made from the durable outer shell to the gorgeous interior. The suitcase has tsa locks which are ideal for air travel. The overall feel of the bag is lightweight but very sturdy. The wheels roll really smoothly and it is easy to maneuver. I like the front compartment. It's great for electronics or a laptop along with other personals. The suitcase would work great as a carry one, but keep in mind it's size. This is a small suitcase good for up to three days if you're a light and efficient packer. Overall, the design and patterned lining is easy to fall in love with and it's functionality is top notch. Great bag for short trips.",
