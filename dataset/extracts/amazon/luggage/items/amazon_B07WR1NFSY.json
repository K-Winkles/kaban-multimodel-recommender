                "reviewText": "I had to quickly find a suitcase that could be overnighted and delivered early. This was the only one, and I was bummed because it was so masculine, navy blue, with a big silver Kenneth Cole name plate. BUT\u2026 wow! The many zippered pockets are awesome, it is very lightweight, and the wheels and handle made transport a breeze. I was actually happy when I started packing it, even happier as I transported, then even more so when picking it up at baggage claim. The navy blue, silver tag, and unique double wheels made it so easy to find. Now I feel like it just looks like a solid no-frills suitcase, but not too masculine as to be embarrassing. Even though I wanted \u201cpretty\u201d, I love this suitcase.",

                "reviewText": "This set survived a two week trip to and through Ghana (we moved to several hotels; my flights connected a couple of times). So, I was pleased with its durability. We'll see how it continues to hold up.I still use a Kenneth Cole carry-on I've traveled with extensively for about seven years. But the PU leather on it is peeling and the zipper pull is broken; plus the mesh pocket inside ripped--not untravel-able just a little worn. Tells how well these keep.Anyway, I'll be using the smaller one in this set to replace that one.In this set, the large suitcase does not glide easily and can twist your wrist if you're not careful.They were both deep-ish and roomy and the color is great because while it doesn't show stains easily it also isn't the hard-to-pick-out-at-baggage-claim black.I got a great deal on this set through Amazon Warehouse and am very satisfied with it despite the rolling problem (which is why I give it four stars).",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bag for a 2 week trip abroad and it held everything I needed without having to use the expansion zipper. It fit nicely in the overhead bin on the plane and was easily maneuverable through the airports/taxis/buses/planes, etc. on the trip. I did use the expansion zipper between stops but when I was ready to fly home, I rolled everything up and zipped up without expansion. I fit 4 pairs of pants, 2 light jackets, 1 blazer, 10 lightweight tops and 1 heavier sweater and 1 pair of sandals and 1 pair of booties in it and managed to fit all our souvenirs in on the way home. The zippers worked smoothly as did the wheels. The outside pockets were nice for toiletries that had to be removed through security and provided easy access to smaller items.",

                "reviewText": "Love the size and storage of the carry on bag with handles on the side and bottom for lifting up into the overhead bin. The zippers worked well. The bottom front pocket held a TSA bag of liquids. The expansion went all around the bottom of the bag which gave more room unlike one bag I bought that was only around the bottom area and another bag that had the expansion on the lid. It had 2 good size zippered pockets on the inside of the lid. The one thing I didn't like was the pull up handle was wobbly and didn't feel sturdy or lock in place easily. Wheels seems to roll nice on my tile floor but don't like the feel of the handle being wobbly trying to steer it around. Time will tell how it does at the airport.",
