But Shivani with Amazon sent this one and it got here today! Amen! I bought the smallest size 20\u201d interior from Walmart initially and figured why not get the largest one \u201c28 interior to replace my old red one! See picture for reference! It\u2019s sleek and beautiful as always! The patterns on the outside and the gold accents just make it pop! I feel like a fancy business lady in the airport!!! Thanks Amazon and thank you American Tourister! The only brand I\u2019ve sworn by since I was a little girl! \ud83d\udc95Durable, strong, super light, roomy, and I love that it has separate compartments; one on the left with a large zipper and a mini zipper with a divider and then one on the right that\u2019s fully open with the clip strap for clothes. There\u2019s also a zipper flap on the right side as well for jewelry or other small items. It\u2019s got an extension zipper on the exterior as well so if you need an extra inch or two of room for space you can expand it if needed! All in all, my fave brand and this set although each suitcase is purchased separately, I love through and through!!",

At that time I was travelling for work weekly - so this thing took a beating.I would fly 2-3 times per week and check this bag. There are a few scuffs on the outside, but the pattern hides them well. All handles are in good working order, and the wheels are all still in great condition.The suitcase is large. I appreciate that one side can be zipped closed, while the other has elastic straps that keep your items organized. I highly recommend using travel cubes to keep your items organized when you travel.10/10, would buy this suitcase again but thankfully it's so great I don't think I'll need to buy another any time soon! Well, except maybe to get a carry on size.",
