                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Im Absolutely loving my BAGSMART Luggage Suitcase I didnt get the set just the Suitcase but it's perfect the 20 inch carry on is like a travel companion with its spinner wheels, making airport navigation a total breeze and the expandable feature has come in handy when I tend to shop a bit more than planned while on vacation also the TSA lock gives me that added sense of security a small detail but it matters. Though I didn't snag a tote bag, the rolling suitcases alone have proven to be super handy its simple, sleek, and seriously practical its become my go to for stress free travels. 5 stars for BAGSMART as they've made my journeys a whole lot smoother!",
