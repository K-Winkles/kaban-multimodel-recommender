                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 10 year old as a gift. We just took a 2 week road trip, and this was what she used. It is so much roomier than I expected. She had outfits for every day of the trip, plus a hoodie and jacket, and extra pair of shoes. We didn't even need to use the expander on the suitcase. She loves the extra little bag that goes with it and used it to keep her toiletry bag, swimsuit, socks and underwear, and it all fit perfectly, giving her more room in the suitcase she didn't even really need. This thing was in and out of the back of a minivan, and the decoration has held up and I haven't seen any noticeable scratches or marks. This was a good purchase, and it's really cute (we got the white with the butterfly). Would be good even for an adult for a 5 day trip.",

Trying to juggle a carry on, my checked bag my purse, my dogs bed and the dog is quite a task. This bag, with the bag that sits on top was the perfect solution. I am able to fit everything I need to into both of these bags, and then I can hook my purse on top of the handle! After two long trips, Seattle and Anchorage from So. Cal, during which I checked the bigger bag, along with many car trips, only one bag has suffered at all. The bigger bag got a scratch mark during my plane travels. I was able to clean off the black part of the mark with no problem leaving it almost unnoticeable. Finding your bag on the conveyor at the airport is no problem, and I received a lot of compliments. The TSA Lock is a nice feature, it took me a minute to figure it out, but love it. I will be purchasing the additional larger bags before the summer.",
