It is about an inch taller than our other Samsonite carry on bag.Other than that, it seems to be a very good bag, as most Samsonite bags are.",

                "reviewText": "It was cheap, moves well, and looks like a great quality. My first trip with it is not for another month, but this has the look of a suitcase that\u2019s going to last me a long time. Has a couple of organizational pockets, which I\u2019m happy about. For the record, I received the color I ordered. I got the 25\u201d, which (without anything in it) is about 58 linear inches, well under the 62 inches I\u2019ll be allowed by the airline when I check it. Looks like I could even stuff the outer pockets, extending the depth, and still come within the limits. (Now, not to go over the weight limit with such a big suitcase, that will be my challenge\u2026) Anyway, this is a good buy; I\u2019m pleased with this purchase.",

Found this Samsonite Aspire at very good price and as item described very good and less than 5% imperfections bought it. First item arrived night before my departure, flight was scheduled at 8:00am next morning, at the airport noticed this huge hole in the big bag like was open with a knife, I could not believe how this item was rated very good by @amazon.I contacted customer service and my options are return it, am back at Dominican Republic and return it will cost more than purchase a new one or Us25.47 refund, shame on you Amazon \ud83d\udc4ein all my years as buyer never feel disappointed as I am today.",
