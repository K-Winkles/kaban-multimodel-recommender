                "reviewText": "I looked at a million different luggage carry on sets before I bought this set. I ordered cream for me and black for my husband. I needed carry on luggage that was not going to be turned down by any airline so it had to be slightly smaller than 22 x 14 x 9. This is one of the few sets that including the wheels and handle, is a fraction smaller than 22. It looks small when you first take it out of the box but it can hold a lot. The tote is huge with a bottom that can be unzipped. A large tote that can attach to the handle of the roller luggage is important because most second bags are significantly smaller than the roller or do not attach. That is not the case with this luggage. I\u2019m using it to pack for an eight day international trip. If it does not go well, I will update this post.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not one to write long reviews but I\u2019m obsessed with this luggage. I was looking to upgrade my luggage from my old hand-me-down felt suitcase and I wanted something cute and durable yet affordable. I was considering buying Beis or Away but their price points were still too expensive for me. I stumbled across this listing because I loved the beige and white colors, and I loved the bonus of the free tote expandable tote bag + toiletry bag. At the time, it was brand new on amazon and had 0 reviews so I took a risk and purchased the carry on.I took the carry-on on a work trip to Texas a few days later and was thoroughly impressed. I doubted the tote bag could fit what I usually brought in my backpack but it actually fit more items - laptop and charger, toiletry bag, tsa liquids, books, travel pillow, binder, jacket, 40 oz water bottle\u2026and this was without even expanding it. It also had a strap on the back so you can attach it to your suitcase and roll it. I received so many compliments from hotel guests and all of my coworkers, they all thought it looked expensive lol. I highly recommend using packing cubes to help maximize the space in the suitcase since it doesn\u2019t expand, but it still has a lot of room!I used it again for another work trip a few weeks later and it was still in perfect condition. Afterwards, I decided to purchase the 5 piece set with the large checked luggages because it was a better deal and includes a lot for less than the price of 1 Away carry-on suitcase.I took a long trip to California and Hawaii with the 20-inch carry on, the 24-inch, and the 28-inch suitcases last week that involved a lot of unpacking, repacking, moving hotels constantly, and checking them at the airport multiple times. We filled all the bags to almost 50 lbs and I saw the airport staff being really rough and throwing the luggage onto the belt so it was truly put to the test. We packed the suitcases to the brim so the zippers were good quality for withstanding us being rough with it. When we got them back it was dirty/scuffed - which is to be expected from white suitcases, but there was no damage outside of that. It was easy to buff out the scuffs at home, I just used soap and water and the dirt came off easily (same with the toiletry bag and tote). An added perk is that no one else had luggage that looked like ours so it was super easy to spot them at the baggage claim (we had to do baggage claim like 3-4 times and each time we spotted ours instantly without confusion, unlike my old hand-me-down luggage).These luggages survived 4+ trips in the span of one month and I\u2019m officially hooked! Will be recommending them to all my friends and family.",

In the first picture are the medium, carry-on, and personal bags, as the large had already been checked in. The small personal bag holds A LOT even without extending the bottom zipper. I got so many compliments about my suitcase for the first time. However, upon arrival, I was devastated to find that the middle suitcase had a gash and they were all scratched so easily. I had high hopes for the durability as they all felt so sturdy, not to mention that this wasn't necessarily cheap hence the 3 stars.",

I have been looking for some new luggage for awhile now, and after plenty of research and shopping I am pleased that I settled for this set. It was a great price for the 5 piece set, and it looks amazing. I loved that the size of the carry on is as advertised, which was a relief. The locks work well on each piece. I find the wheels do well on smooth and carpet. Overall for the price, this luggage seems as good if not better than others out there for quality.
