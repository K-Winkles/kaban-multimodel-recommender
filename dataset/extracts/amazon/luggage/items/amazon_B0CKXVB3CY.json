Unlike other suitcases I\u2019ve had, this one literally glides with me. It doesn\u2019t take much effort at all to push through the airport or even on bumpier terrain like the parking lot. I really like the attached lock to protect my belongings. It\u2019s easy to set. Highly recommend as if you travel you know suitcases can be handled roughly during the trip, this one can take a beating.",
