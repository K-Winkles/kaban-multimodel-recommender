Won\u2019t be able to comment on overall durability until we\u2019ve used it for a few more trips, but so far, so good.",

                "reviewText": "A Tough, Lightweight Traveler\u2026 I did a lot of research before selecting the SwissGear 4010 Soft-side Carry-on, 360-degree spinner, 18 inches. First and foremost, it met the size requirement for European airlines and having owned several SwissGear products, I knew I could count on the quality. I was a little concerned that instead of eight wheels it had only four, but this little guy handled almost all the airport bumps with no problem and stood up to the rough tiled streets of Lisbon with aplomb. There was plenty of room inside, and I was even able to fit in an extra pair of shoes and folded sportscoat. Also, it\u2019s very lightweight and easy to lift into the overhead compartment. The only issue I had (which I noted in some reviews) was the ratcheting handle sometimes wouldn\u2019t always stay in place, but this was not a deal-breaker. This IS a carry-on, and I wouldn\u2019t check it with any expectations of it coming through unscathed. All in all, I\u2019m very pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Just took this light weight small roll on (despite not having a side handle to facilitate lifting) on a two week trip abroad. Since it was carry on, it was always with me. The handle never held its position once pulled out of the suitcase. This handle doesn\u2019t lock in place and stay there. It slips up and down, even on escalators, when moving on uneven surfaces. Honestly, traveling means carrying another bag, packages etc. and if the roll on is unstable it\u2019s dangerous. Especially getting on and off escalators, going down curbs, rushing to catch trains etc. Very disappointed. It was exhausting adjusting this handle and to remember not to let my hand tough the release button right on top of the handle, that cause it to go up and down. Because that\u2019s the only place meant to adjust the height of the handle. I have lots of roll ons and suitcases. Never have I had one this unstable. Frankly, don\u2019t buy this. You\u2019ll fight with it on every trip.",
