                "reviewText": "When I dropped my suitcase once again from the trunk of a rental car, I heard a crack and noticed a slight wobble on a wheel. The outer shell was cracked.After a brief disappointment I noticed later that I had had this suitcase for well over two years, and used it virtually every week, fully loaded with around 50 lbs, on both domestic and international flights.This thing worked like a charm, the four wheels never so much as squeaked, and it still got my luggage home safely on its last flight.The two big compartments hold a lot, and it's the perfect size for transporting either several weeks worth of clothes or miscellaneous equipment. If the airline allowed, you could load it up with even more than 50 lbs.Nothing broke until now, the handles, the zipper, everything is of great quality!I got a different color this time, I liked the bright orange in particular for it's visibility, but it was not available at the time. The wine red is but beautiful, too.And it arrived early, just in time for my next trip.Highly recommend!",

It rolls smoothly on wheels that suggest more strength against baggage handler hazards than most. All in all I am impressed, especially considering the low price point. We don't plan on subjecting this to extraordinarily heavy use, but it's features will be more than adequate for 45 days in Europe.A postscript: one of the labels in its packaging suggests a French competitor has infiltrated the Coolite print-shop. You will be amazed: big block letters on an enclosed tag that otherwise extols the merits of this item. The unmissable word begins with \"M\" ...look it up.",

                "reviewText": "Originally purchased in 2019 for our cruise to Bermuda, this luggage set has stood the test of time and aggressive baggage handlers quite well. I really can't think of anything bad about this set of luggage, no wheels have fallen off, they haven't cracked or broken, the locks and zippers work exactly like they should, the interior zipper pouches haven't torn, the static handles on the top and side are still very secure and the extending pull handles haven't faltered....I really can't find anything wrong with this set of luggage. As I said, we originally bought this set to go on a six day cruise to Bermuda. Since then, this set (maybe not all pieces each time, but at least two each time) have gone with us to a bunch of other vacations. Let's see:four day stay in Myrtle beach - 9 hours by carone week stay in Orlando - 18 hours by carfour day stay in Destin, Florida - four flights, two either wayfive days in Jamaica - four flights, two either wayfour days in Plymouth Massachusetts - 14 hours by carthree days in Gatlinburg, Tennessee - 8 hours by car2022 update:Five days in St. Lucia, four flights, two either way2023 update:Las Vegas for four days, four flights totalOriginal review:Plenty of time in the car so that's loading and unloading and rubbing during transport, but eight flights total so far. So that's a dozen flights that they have been handled by the baggage people (initial loading for first flight, transfer to second aircraft, final unload at destination), so these things have seem some action, you know those baggage handlers don't go easy on luggage, not to mention falling down those luggage chutes. There are a few dings and scratches, but absolutely nothing that would make you consider having to buy a new set. I'd go so far as to say I've actually abused the largest bag quite a lot. When we came back from Jamaica we had a lot more stuff (gifts) so we had to purchase a bad to hold all of it. I rolled that large bag through what seemed like endless amounts of airport with two fairly heavy bags on top of this thing, slung around the extendable pull handle. It didn't care at all, it continued to operate just fine.I'm not joking, I feel like I could take a baseball bat to these bags right now and they'd probably be just fine. My parents are going on a cruise this July and I've recommended this set to them. I'd recommend this set to anyone, really. When you finish using them, just nest them together and they only take up as much space as the largest of them.What would I change? That's a hard one, I can't think of much that needs to be reworked with these. Just about the only thing I'd like, is the ability to hook them together to make pushing more than one of them together easier through an airport. I mean, I could do this myself with some 550 cord or some bungee straps, but that would be super ghetto-ish, not to mention that once I no longer need them hooked together, I'd have to stash the bungee cords or rope somewhere, either on myself on in the bags. Now let's imagine the scenario where I have to explain to airport security why I have paracord or bungee straps on my person.2022 update:Went to St. Lucia for five days, luggage doesn't care, took it like a champ. Used the largest and smallest bag in the set, no cracks, breaks, nothing. Just keeps on rolling and taking all the abuse the airlines throw at them.2023 update:Las Vegas for four days, four more flights, took just the large one this time. Again, no issues.The bottom line is this; we love these bags, they haven't failed us. They are strong and very easily worth the money. Just pick a color you like and buy now.",

No issues with the handles. They are lighter than my old suitcases that were Swiss brand so I can pack more stuff to fit the weight requirements! They have an expandable option which is nice. There is a divider for one side to keep all your contents on that one side, but if you lift up the not divided side, all your stuff dumps out. The design of the shell makes it easy to spot yours out of all the others, even with the dark grey color that I picked. Super happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "So, I noticed when I got the items that the material seems a little flimsy. It\u2019s a hard surface, but it bends. I was nervous that it would dent and not hold together. There is nothing better than to test it out in real time.I landed and was using the smaller carry on luggage for my first flight. I got on the escalator going down and let it rest by my foot. Somehow, I must have bumped it but it took off bouncing down the escalator and hit a lady about 50 steps down. She heard it but wasn\u2019t sure what the noise was. I asked her if she was ok and she said yes. No damage to the luggage as it took a hard fall.My next trip I took the large one. Even though I was gone for 5 days, the luggage label said it was for 7-9 days. It was ok as I probably overpacked. I am a male and usually travel lighter. But, I said this time I will travel extra and not worry about taking too much. It held up well, withstood the claim baggage people (who aren\u2019t always kind), and it rolled well thru the airport. It weighed about 47 pounds so I know I can fill it up and stay under the 50 lbs limit. Lastly, it was there smiling at me in the back room baggage claim as I had to change planes and catch up to it. It knew whose daddy it was at the end of my travel.",
