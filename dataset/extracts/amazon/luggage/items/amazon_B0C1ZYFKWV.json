                "reviewText": "Purchased 2 of these (Samsonite Stryde Hardside Glider Medium Journey, Blue Slate) as my 1st \"hardshell\" bags for international travel. This review is written after 9 months and 3 international tripsPart of the attraction being that they are quite distinctive and easily recognized on the carousel. Despite their unusual dimensions they still fit a full height 3 part tripod diagonally though you need to take the head off and you can easily fit the full 50 pounds of luggage allowance while the dimensions suit all American carriers (and all international ones I know of)In use they have proved reliable, easy to maneuver and fairly tough (1 corner of 1 bag did get knocked in but a push from the inside restored it) and very very stable (presumably due to how low to the ground they are)Just remember which way is \"up\" so you don't dump the contents out when you open it.As an added bonus, they roll under the turnstiles for the MTA (NY city) subway and PATH - though they roll so well so need to be careful they don't get away from you when you do that.Can also be used to transport rack mounted gear so long as it is not more than 40cm (1' 4\") deep or higher than 4UOverall very happy with them. They are not 'run over it with a truck' strong (just 'good for baggage handler' strong but that is the tradeoff you must pay for the lighter weight",

This one handled beautifully; super easy to lift, wheel, and pivot, making it seem super light-weight. I had no problem maneuvering it through multiple airports and uneven pavement with just one hand. Love how it has compartments and straps for holding items in place. Fits easily in the backseat of a car or in a trunk. Got many compliments on it.",

                "reviewText": "After 3 attempts I finally found the perfect carry-on suitcase. This one is the exact max size required by Alaska Air. I didn't want to risk it being too large for the overhead bins even by an inch. This one does expand if needed but I'm packing light for a long weekend trip. I love the color and the handle has a nice feel. Time will tell in regard to the wear/tear element but I am hopeful that as a Samsonite product it will hold up well. The wheels on these suitcases always seem questionable but I'm giving the benefit of the doubt until I put it to the test.",

                "reviewText": "We travel and use our luggage quite a bit. Had our last set for 5 years. I looked at a lot of different luggage on the internet and in person. This luggage is great. The \"square\" shape is unique and is a real plus. It fits easy in the car and everywhere else. It is easily identifiable at the airport. The luggage is durable, made well, the wheels roll perfectly. The inside and the various compartments were the final selling point for me. I found no interior in any other luggage as luxurious as this. The only negative is the zippers. I noticed some brands have these easy slide zippers and this does not. These are not so smooth. Lots more positives than this only negative. I purchased 2 large, 2 medium, and one of the small carry on size. Another plus is it's Moderate price. You will not find anything better. You will be very happy with this purchase.",

There are 2 pockets inside that's really practical for extra small clothings like socks and underwear that you want to grab without having to search the whole luggage. Built sturdy, zippers glide smoothly. BTW. This is a medium size strider. I'll probably purchase the large strider if availabe at Amazon.Thank you Samsonite.",

El precio es muy elevado pero con los descuentos del Hot Sale cost\u00f3 mucho menos. El material r\u00edgido se ve resistente y de buena calidad. Las llantas funcionales y pr\u00e1cticas. En el interior toda forrada de tela y cuenta con bolsa de pl\u00e1stico para art\u00edculos de ba\u00f1o, bolsa de malla para art\u00edculos peque\u00f1os, bolsa adicional con cierre en la tapa interior de la maleta y una peque\u00f1a bolsa de malla para meter objetos peque\u00f1os en el espacio libre que queda entre las barras de la agarradera. De hecho, la agarradera se me hizo que es un poco fr\u00e1gil aunque realmente es pr\u00e1ctica por ser ancha y cuenta con 8 posiciones. A largo plazo ver\u00e9 si realmente no se rompe con el uso. Los cierres se notan de calidad superior y cuenta con sistema de candado pr\u00e1ctico y f\u00e1cil de poner la combinaci\u00f3n. En general la calidad es superior, el dise\u00f1o tambien y realmente est\u00e1 muy amplia para una maleta de \u00e9stas dimensiones, aparte de que se puede expandir algunos cent\u00edmetros adicionales con sistema de cierres integrados. Sobre el color es como la ilustraci\u00f3n un azul met\u00e1lico gris\u00e1ceo elegante y moderno con dise\u00f1o de relieve vanguardista. Estoy contento con mi compra y creo que me servir\u00e1 bastantes a\u00f1os. S\u00faper recomendable",
