                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressed with the quality and performance of this Delsey luggage",
                "reviewText": "Very impressed with the quality and performance of this product.I had previously bought another suitcase made by Delsey for a 3 week European vacation during which it performed admirably, and so when I was looking to buy another piece of luggage, I gave preference to the Delsey brand.Having traveled for many years, I had always used traditional soft-sided ballistic nylon pieces, but, after seeing a lot of people in airports using the hard-sided cases, I was open to trying that type of suitcase.When it arrived, I was happy to note how light it was, despite appearing to be very well made. The nylon and zippers all seemed like they were good quality, and I found the lock mechanism interesting (if a little intimidating at first because I had never seen that type before). The lock was very easy to work once I read the directions.On to the actual use... I like the way the two compartments are laid out - one has a nylon zip covering to contain contents, with an integrated zip pocket, the other has an adjustable strap that spans the entire space, plus a small zip pouch. On the way to our destination in the Caribbean, I had the suitcase packed completely full, and it weighed just under 40 lbs. On the way back, it was over-packed with the expandable zipper let out and stuffed to capacity, and still was only 46 lbs.We traveled to 2 small Caribbean islands on regional carriers, and the bag was handled many times at the airport and in transit numerous times. I noticed a few surface scratches, but nothing out of the ordinary. The handles are very comfortable, and the wheels are smooth and the bag is very easy to maneuver.On the way back, an entire 5th of rum exploded in the suitcase, and because it was hard-sided, the majority of it dribbled out the bottom. The contents were hardly affected because they were encased in plastic compression bags, and only part of the nylon lining got rum on it. A big benefit of the bag being hard sided plastic, most of the rum ran out and was not soaked up as it would have been with a fabric bag.On the whole, I could not be happier with this luggage and wholeheartedly can recommend it, as well as being most impressed with both Delsey products we have purchased.",

                "reviewText": "I've traveled the world hundreds of times using a Delsey bag purchased in 2006, it's an unbelievable tank. Also was more than 2x the price of this bag. The bag, wheels, handles, zippers all still fully functional. Nothing ever broke on that bag. But....it weighs a ton! I bought this new bag knowing it probably will not be as robust or durable but needed something smaller and lighter. For sure the new bag is very light, rolls and manuvers as advertised. Lots of storage space, and the front compartment has me thinking I could even ditch my backpack too for shorter trips! However I can't imagine that it will last for decades like the Delsey tank from 2006. Still, this bag is a winner in my book. Perfect fit for fast and easy travel. Really impressed. Hope it lasts!",

                "reviewText": "I have had my Delsey cobalt blue helium 19\" carry on as my main luggage for when I travel for work. It's perfect for the smaller overhead bins in Southwest and it's sturdy enough to be checked in. After 6 years of hard use, I decided I would treat myself to a new, more updated case. I bought this titanium case in silver and it looks lovely and the wheels are solid. I also like the interior packing compartments better than the helium. However, for me when I travel, I always have a laptop backpack that subs as a purse. I noticed that the extended handle on this bad was thinner and looser, and basically flimsier, than my old helium bag. Not only does it feel like it will snap of you go down a few stairs, the handle part of the extender juts out so if you try and lift your backpack off the handle, the parts of the handle jutting out catch the backpack strap and you have to really work it to get it off. I don't have time for that when I have people breathing down my neck whilst boarding the plane. So, I do love the Delsey brand, just not this line. This is great for road trips and the off vacation, but if you use it all the time for work, go for the helium line. It's a solid workhorse.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot comment on the performance of this suitcase since I just received it. It is very attractive and seems like it would be durable - it was rated highly for durability. It moves beautifully along the floor. The silver color is beautiful. I love the separate compartment for my laptop. I would warn you to check the actual dimensions vs what is advertised. It is the 19\u201d but is actually 21.5 inches tall. The other 21\u201d suitcase (large carry on) is more like 23\u201d and will be needed to be checked. I read that from owner reviews so bought the smaller carry on which is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "Updated review after 1 year:So, since leaving my original review I took a job that has me traveling about every other week, on average. This suitcase is great. It\u2019s held up & even though I repeatedly expect the handles to bend due to putting a heavy bag on top, it hasn\u2019t yet. Best feature is that if running through airports to catch a connection is your idea of cardio- and this seems to be my m.o.- then these wheels are a dream. I\u2019m 100% sure I wouldn\u2019t have caught several close connections had I been traveling with a different brand that wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle all the crooks and crannies of terminal floors at high speeds. Added bonus, on the occasion that the flight is overbooked & I have to check my carryon, this suitcase is easy to spot.My previous review mentioned the lock. I\u2019ve had no issues since that first use, so perhaps that\u2019s a learning curve but still one worth getting past.Thought it was flimsy when it arrived but holds up great & moves so easily. 4 stars because it is too easy to accidentally reset the lock meaning you'll have to spend an hour or so going through all the possible combinations to unlock. If you buy, be sure to be mindful not to accidently reset the lock.",
