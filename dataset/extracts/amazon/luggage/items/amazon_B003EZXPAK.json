                "reviewText": "My luggage set actually arrived in just one day with prime, instead of two. It didn't really matter, since my trip is still over a month away, but it is always a nice surprise when this does happen.The reviews concerned me, at first, that I was about to pay $99 for something that would just get ripped up. However, I decided to go for it since I loved the polka dots and I don't see myself getting on a plane anytime soon, or maybe ever.I was actually surprised when I opened the box that the fabric felt thicker and higher quality than the one black rolling back I have been using for years (hand-me-down from my mom). The wheels roll smoothly, the handles open/close smoothly and have a nice, satisfying click to them when you push them back in. Small detail that doesn't matter... the whole handle is black, not gray or silver like in the picture. I actually prefer this.Another reason I like this set over others, is that the bags have the full length pockets on the front, instead of the two smaller pockets that most have. Not only does this look better, but allows for bigger/longer items (such as large envelopes) to be separate from the main bag.My zippers do not, in any way, seem cheap or plastic. I don't know if they upgraded the zipper pulls since previous reviews, but mine are metal with a thick rubber grip on them. They are quite nice and I don't see them snapping off at any point.The inside lining does zip open, if needed. However, the lining is pulled tight and, in my opinion, makes the need for extra support on the back of the bag unnecessary. I was prepared to do the cardboard adding thing, but I actually prefer the bags as they are, since they will provide more room for clothes without putting in a backing. The zipper lining feature is nice, though, as you could easily put extra cash or anything inside in case you are worried someone might go looking through your bags. I'd imagine that the nifty cardboard idea would make the zipper \"pocket\" an even better hiding place.Additional features include little slide in name tags, side handles, large mesh \"pockets\" on the inner \"flap\" and a lock with two keys on each bag. The locks and keys do feel cheap (think middle school diary), but that doesn't matter to me as I never bother locking anything that can be carried away.The smell isn't as strong as I expected from other reviews, but it IS there and it is not pleasant. It is no more than you would expect from any new book bag or anything though. It will air out in no time.Overall, I am in love with this set, and I am so glad I bought it. This is my first luggage set, ever. I used to piece together random bags from my mom for weekend trips. However, we are about to embark on our very first week long family vacation and I figured it was about time to get grown up luggage. I highly recommend this set.. the worst that could happen is you might actually get a defective set, as happens from time to time with any product. However, amazon would help you to exchange them AND they come with a 5 year warranty.Happy shopping!",

                "reviewText": "These were purchased for me as a gift and though I was a little skeptical due to some of the reviews, they served my purpose well. The largest one fits within airline guidelines for checked luggage and I found it was more than enough space for our trip to San Diego. They come with locks attached, but they are a little flimsy. I didn't need them, so that was not an issue for me. There are many, many patterns and colors to choose from and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a sturdy, stylish luggage set. They went through flight changes, being checked and tossed around and were just fine at the end of our trip.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the versatility of having different size bags all for one price. The biggest one isn't really that big, I was hoping it was a bit bigger in width and height. I like how all of them fit inside eachother to save space when not in use. The only part that I think they could have made a little more sturdier is the back. There is no hard part to it, the back part is just the fabric so if you have something sharp possibly it would poke and probably tear the fabric which isn't very thick. It had this zipper lining inside that you can actually open so I ended up cutting a piece of hard cardboard and putting it inside the bottom and then zipping it back up so it has a sturdy back. Plus it gives it a flat surface to put your clothes in when packing, otherwise it's all over the place. Otherwise for the price it's well worth it for travelers that only need luggage once in a while. I'm sure with time it will break but overall the look is cute and everything looks good!",

Where to begin?Let's start with how the colors look online versus in real life. Yes this luggage is kind of loud online. But the pink seems a but muted for being such a true pink, and the material on the body looks like it might be un-cheap enough to offset that bold consummate-V pattern. In real life? Three different tones of neon pink. Neon. And is several different materials- the handle is part fabric strap material and part plasticky my pleather, and im not sure about the rest. And the body material? You can practically see through the white. It screams \"everyone look at my cheap obnoxious luggage!\"Don't even get me started on how the body fabric on the large outer front compartments was seen on noticeably crooked on two of the four pieces. This luggage set went right back in the box faster than I took it out.Long story short: if you want/need a full set of cheap matched luggage that no one else on your flight or continent will have, and you only have $100 to spend, then you hit the jackpot. Everyone else: run.",
