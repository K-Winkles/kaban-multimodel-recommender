                "reviewText": "I do a good bit of 2-day trips for work, and I got so tired of lugging around a rolling bag. Plus, I wanted some luggage that made me happy to look at it! I'm so pleased with this purchase. Here's why:STRAP: I love that this has a long strap, so that I can drape this over my shoulder to carry it. It's much more comfortable that carrying it on one shoulder, and it keeps my hands free.WASHABLE: One of the most important things for me, in deciding to buy a cloth bag, was that I be able to put it in the laundry. I try to treat my luggage well, but I'm sure there's going to come a time that this bag goes on a gross airport floor, or I accidentally spill some shampoo, or something. This bag can be washed. There's a big rectangular piece of plastic at the bottom, and I'll have to figure out how to get it out without bending it too much. So, it won't be the easiest thing in the world, but I will be able to put this through the washing machine. That makes me happy.PRETTY: I just love this bag. I use it on work trips, and even though I work in a conservative field, I decided \"screw it,\" I want to get a pattern that makes me happy. I have this bag in the blue/white pattern, and it is just so pretty.DURABLE AND USEFUL: The bag is made of thick material. There are 5 inside pockets, which is where I keep all of my toiletries neatly organized. (I have a set of \"travel\" toiletries that stay in there all the time, so that I don't have to spend much time packing.) Also, there is the sleeve on the back, so that this bag can hook onto the handle of a rolling suitcase. This bag is a good size. I can put two pairs of shoes, a few changes of clothes, and my toiletries in it. It has enough room for a multi-day trip. It would probably be tight if you wanted to pack it for a whole week, but I think that would be manageable if you're strategic.So all in all, I'm really happy with this! Recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this in the recycled cotton Galaxy Grey. I have owned many Vera bags over the years, but have not made a new purchase in the last 4 or 5. The material is soft cotton, and lightweight. I like that they skipped the traditional quilting for this particular style. Honestly it does not look like a Vera Bradley bag. Depending on your personal taste that may be a good or bad thing. Even the zipper pulls are non descriptive. For me, I am pleased with the aesthetic.My plan is to use this as a gym bag, and for short overnights. I\u2019m a size Large/ 12, and I can pack 2 jeans, tops, and a sweatshirt, 2 PJ (all rolled) as well as a small toiletries/ makeup bag. Just enough for 2 nights.For the gym, I can pack sneakers, and clothing with ease, fits a water bottle as well.The interior pockets are great for organizing those small items. The front pocket was large enough for my iPad and charging cables.I took off one star for the structure, Vera Bradley never puts any structure into the sides of its bags. It would make packing easier if it stood up on its own.Overall I\u2019m pleased with this purchase and am looking forward to using it.",
