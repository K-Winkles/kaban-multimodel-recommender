It\u2019s super easy to use and just gives a little bit of extra peace of mind when leaving luggage with the hotel attendant.Another nice features is the fabric divider with a zipper inside. It helps keep the contents more organized in the bag! I definitely recommend this luggage!",

They are lightweight and strong. They all have clothing tie downs inside on one side of the suitcase and a zip up cover on the other, with pockets.They have a great locking system, and apparently they have a special feature to allow TSA to open without you having to show the changeable 3 digit combination code.I really liked the color as well. Have a few trips planned for this coming year (already used once) and looking forward to having nice new luggage to use on trips.",
