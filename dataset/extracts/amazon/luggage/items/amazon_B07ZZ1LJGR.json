                "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace a 20 year old Samsonite that had to get put out to pasture. I was looking for a lighter weight suitcase that had a few more options and less weight. Since my previous suitcase was a Samsonite hard side I went with the DLX. This is definitely lighter and there are plenty of storage options. Places to tuck various items in. It does expand and hasn't prevented me from getting through any airline size restrictions. The only issue I have is the durability of the extendable handle and wheels. They seemed to have missed the memo on Samsonite quality reputation. One wheel is starting to act up and has an issue swiveling when there's weight. The handle is getting a little loose. Wish they still had a two wheel option.",

Bought this new bag as a replacement and it's incredibly durable (Same model, features, wheels, zippers, soft shell, etc.) BUT... was marketed as a 22-inch bag and when it arrived was only 20 inches tall with an interior of 19 inches. I use it for my laptop and this was literally a couple of inches too small for my needs. I sent it back and bought the bigger version. NOTE: CHECK the specs on the listing pages. If the 22-inch is unavailable, you will be re-routed to the \"next available\" bag and may purchase the smaller bag without knowing it. This bag though, will take a beating and last for years.",

I am crazy about researching items before I buy anything and I did a ton of research on suitcases in preparation for a trip I'll be taking later this year. The big hurdle was trying to find a suitcase set I wanted that fulfilled the picky requirements of Air France/ KLM airlines. Don't even get me started on their under-seat bag restrictions. I had to decide between hard side and soft side and chose soft side hoping it would be more pliable and not dent or crack like many hard-sided cases I read about in reviews. I like outside pockets that don't take up room from the interior room for clothes. I wanted a USB port, which this one has, and it's located in an exterior side pocket which I think can double as a water bottle pocket. It does not have the new TSA locks that zippers snap into but that was not a bid deal for me as I've always used my own TSA padlocks and they work fine. The extendable trolley handles seem a teeny bit flimsier than other suitcases I saw in stores but everything else seems so sturdy and well made. Note: the wheels spin very easily and smoothly but they seemed to struggle a bit when I rolled my suitcase from hardwood floor to a thick area rug. Once on the rug it rolled pretty well. I also bought the 25\" case for longer trips and the carry-on bag has a strap that enables you to set it on the trolley handle of a larger case so you don't have to wheel two suitcases around. The interior is simple but well thought out with a wet bag and other compartments. This is ideal not just for swimsuits and really wet items but for those mornings when I have to pack up items I washed the night before that didn't quite dry thoroughly. There are little slots on either side of the main interior compartment that the tie-down straps slip into so they can stay out of the way while you're packing. Good thinking. The main compartment for the carry-on is deep and roomy. I will add to my review once I actually pack. I'm going to try to pack for two weeks abroad in just my carry-on and my under-seat bag but if that doesn't work I'll use the 25\" case. I ordered the blue color which appears to be a medium deep royal blue but in person it's what I call a true dark teal, which I love. In different light it can look like green or blue. I wanted a color or style that doesn't shout out \"A woman uses this bag!\" (for protection...I don't want to be a target) The two brands it came down to were Travelpro and Samsonite. Both have very good guarantees. It was very hard to find a set from Travelpro that had everything I wanted and since I had loved my 30-year-old Samsonite cases I had gotten rid of last year, and the reviews were so good for the Solyte set, I went with Samsonite. The four stars are only because I haven't used them yet. I really hope to give them five stars in a later review.",

The only thing that's annoying is I keep getting my hand pinched in the handle, as it stretches out into two sections and then contracts when put down; if you aren't careful, your hand or fingers get caught in between and you will be cussing because it hurts so much. Still great quality and would buy again.",
