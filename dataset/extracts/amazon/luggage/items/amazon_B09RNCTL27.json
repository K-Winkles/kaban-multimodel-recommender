It's not a high-security thing, but it keeps the case closed. The Travelpro brand was marked discreetly on the front. I also ordered a different brand suitcase that was a little cheaper and had a slightly better rating, but it had the lock on the top by the handle, which is not convenient when opening the suitcase for unpacking. It also had its brand name in big letters across the front where no one could miss it. I do not mind branding on things, but this was overboard. It made the whole thing look cheesy (in my opinion). The Travelpro did well on its first trip. I like it. The other one went back.",

It glides well w/ 8 wheels and I love the color I chose. My only concern is the fact that there are only two handles on the entire bag making it difficult to lift, move and grab off the luggage turnstile. My husband had to grab the bag by the wheels to get a hold of it and retrieve it before it went around again! I love the sleekness of the bag. I guess I need to get used to the fact that there are no outside pockets. I loaded the bag on the floor for my return trip and found it difficult to reach the top because it is so large. But on the plus side, I was able to pack clothes for a week long trip, all toiletries, extra shoes, my pillow, a stuffable winter coat and a few books! All in all I am very happy w/ this set. Will purchase the medium size for a trip to Europe because I believe the 28-inch will not be easily manageable for a 70+ senior.",

                "reviewText": "I don't have much to add to L. Belanger's excellent review above.The bag itself is a dream to use - well made, swivels or can be tipped up to use on just 2 wheels and works flawlessly either way. There is plenty of space, and I really appreciate the way the expansion section is designed as it adds significant cubic inches to the overall capacity without compromising the bag's ability to fit in an overhead bin.However ... the cheap plastic wheels are of very poor quality and will degrade, especially if you take this overseas anywhere where the airport flooring isn't polished tile or concrete. Literally 2 days after my 1 year warranty had expired I took a trip to SE Asia and returned home with the above flat spot now worn into the wheels, a consequence of one of them getting stuck and dragged (unbeknownst to me) for a day or two.\"No worries,\" I thought, \"I'll just order a replacement set of wheels. It'll cost me $20 for $2 worth of rubber, but I'm happy to do that to keep a $150 bag on the road.\"So I started to search for replacement wheels. No dice. No one on Amazon sells them, though there are MANY different versions that are almost the same thing (almost meaning useless in this context, as if it won't screw into the same holes, you can't use it). So I wrote Travelpro, asking where I could buy one from them. I was happy to overpay, again, as I didn't want to throw the bag in the garbage and all it needed was a simple replacement (which no specialized mechanical knowledge was required for - it's literally just unscrewing 5 screws).They insisted I take it to their repair center over an hour away. I refused, knowing that I was past the warranty deadline and would be charged for the repair, which would likely cost most of the price of just buying a new one. After several emails were exchanged, they asked for my address - I assumed I had won and they were going to send me a new wheel assembly!A few days later, a suspiciously large package arrived - it turns out they sent me a whole new bag, free of charge, despite me being out of warranty! So, amazing customer service, I have to say, in the end. They definitely made it right. Now if only I could figure out what to do with the other bag - I still don't want to throw it away!",

Since that is not considered under warranty, I tried contacting Travelpro to get replacement wheels at my expense. The website says to create a claim ticket as if iI have a warranty problem. I tried to create a claim ticket on line, but it would not accept my picture of the problem therefore no ticket # is issued. I tried the Live Chat and after 30 minutes, it referred me back to create a ticket # as they could not help without a ticket #. I sat on hold for 35 minutes, before an automated message told me again to go to the website. I even tried a local TravelPro dealer, but since I ordered this through Amazon, she could not help. I just want to order the wheels, but there is no place to get them; therefore I am stuck with a piece of luggage that has 3 wheels.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased my 21\u201d Maxlite Air specifically to make the switch to Carry-On Only air travel. Had just returned from nearly 3 weeks in France and due to airline chaos in summer 2022 we went carry on only. My wife had a small roller but I had 40L Patagonia Black Hole Duffel which was great but a pain to lug through airports.The Maxlite gives me the same capacity, in a very lightweight hard sided 4-wheel roller. Super high quality and bang for your buck, consistent with all the reviews I had read. Also gives the option to expand it 2\u201d in depth if you wanted to do some shopping and then check the bag on way home. I\u2019ll update my review after our next trip this fall but it is ALL a question of capacity for me so I did a packing test-run.I\u2019m a slim shorter guy (small shirts, 29/30 pants, size 7 shoes) so judge accordingly about quantities. But as per photo attached, I determined the max I can bring as: 8-10 tees/polos, 6-7 button-up shirts, 1 light sweater, 4-5 shorts/swim trunks, 4-5 pants, 1 blazer, 2 jackets, 3 belts, 10 underwear, 12 socks, 2 pairs of shoes and 1 pair of sandals. That includes what I wear on the plane (jeans, tee, sweater, jacket, 1 of the pairs of shoes). But everything else went in the suitcase, along with sunglasses, lint roller and electric razor\u2026and that is NOT expanded. That\u2019s up to 18 tops\u2026and therefore 18 outfits, making Carry-On only a totally realistic option for ANY length of trip, especially if you had a Vrbo or Airbnb with laundry. I will add a third pair of shoes in my small daypack \u201cpersonal item\u201d along with my toiletries and electronics.So it had surprising capacity and was still very lightweight when full. The right hand side that has the handle beneath has less space kind of in 3 little channels, so pack accordingly with shoes etc slotted in between.The Maxlite Air 21\u201d was below all the carry on dimensions for all airlines I checked and I looked at pretty much all the Canadian, American, and European carriers, including discount ones like Easyjet and Ryanair.I\u2019m officially converted to traveling light\u2026and the TravelPro seems to be the perfect fit to make it a more comfortable walk through airports or along city streets. Again will update after my first trip\u2026but hope the above info is useful for anyone who (like me) was very hesitant to ditch the checked luggage.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who has previously used the Travelpro Maxlite soft case, I appreciate the convenience of an external pocket for quick access to items. However, I recently switched to the Travelpro Maxlite Air Hardside 21\" carry-on and have found that the hard-shell design offers more structure and protection for my belongings during travel. While it doesn't have an external pocket, the interior organization system is well-designed and maximizes packing space. Overall, I am pleased with my decision to upgrade to the Maxlite Air Hardside and would recommend it to other travelers in need of a reliable and structured suitcase.",
