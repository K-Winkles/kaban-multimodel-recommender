                "reviewText": "After looking all over at suitcases I chose this one. I had a hard sided 4 wheel case that I spent a lot of money on only to have the airline destroy beyond repair so I knew I only wanted a soft sided 4 wheeler. First off I love that there is one deep inside area as opposed to compartments on two sides. This seems like it is much more efficient with my packing cubes. It has two very deep zipper pockets on the outside perfect for holding all your electronics and necessary travel items. The zippers seem very sturdy as does the suitcase. I chose the red, not because I love the color, but because it cost less than the black. I was pleasantly surprised by the color. It is a lovely shade of cranberry with gold zippers & pulls and I really like the purse like straps on top they should make lifting into the overhead much easier. I'm excited to try it out in a few weeks on my annual girls trip. UPDATE: just returned from a trip and I loved it. Held so much and the handles on side, bottom & top made it so easy to put in overhead bins. So glad I purchased this suitcase \u2764\ufe0f",

The color is gorgeous though. I love the sturdy gold zippers and I do like that it is a deep case which will work well with packing cubes. Caution, it may not meet AA, Delta and US Air carry on requirements as they now have a strict 22\" maximum and this case is almost an inch over that. The discount carriers still take up to 24\" but our family does not use typically use those airlines.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this bag to travel multiple places in a one month time period! We are now in our fourth destination and it has served me very well! Kauai, Boise, San Diego and now Cape Cod. Holds quite a lot of clothing and expands to fit even more! I never travel without a checked bag, but this piece of luggage allowed me to this time. And boy am I glad! Two of our flights got cancelled or had long delays, requiring us to change flights. It made me so happy to have this carry on with me, not checked! A lifesaver! It seems well made, sturdy and rolls really nicely through hotels and airports. I would definitely recommend! I bought the red 21\u201d bag. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "By the time I realized the wheels on my carry on were broken I didn't have time to get a new one. So I carried two heavy tote bags through the airport to my destination. As soon as I arrived, I went on Amazon to find a carryon that would be delivered before I left to return home - which was about 36 hours. Thank you Amazon. I knew I didn't have to look anywhere else. I read the reviews which helped tremendously. I didn't realize that some had only 2 wheels - so I searched for 4 wheels. This is a great carry on - lightweight and so easy to maneuver in the airport. I was alone with a heavy tote bag. Pulling it on the wheels or walking with it standing up straight was so comfortable. There is plenty of room including the outside pockets. The cranberry color is fun as I always get black! I love it and have no complaints - high recommend!",

Super annoying!It's otherwise a nice suitcase, though the carrying handles at the top have to be snapped together and they get in the way of the telescoping handle.",

Looks sleek and had little details that were very functional. However, the wheels make it taller and it looks a lot bulkier. Measurements for carry-on might be a little off. This makes it more likely not to fit in the carry-on size check that they have when boarding. Had to pay to get it checked on one of my flights. Other flights were full and offered to check it for free since \"it was a big carry-on\".",
