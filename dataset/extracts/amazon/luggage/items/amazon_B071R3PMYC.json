                "reviewText": "As of lately I have been very big on getting all my travel items to match. I originally ordered the the grey and tan version of this suitcase (for purpose of not having a black luggage bag like most) however I felt the grey to look a bit greenish and was not pleased with the color so I had returned it for this black/tan version. I love this suitcase! It is esthetically very pleasing. I attached a small lanyard to the side for a subtle identification that it is MY bag when out in public) and it matches the new carrier for my pup. I really do love the different pockets inside the bag which allows me to organize my items I travel with. I use the front large bottom pocket to carry my 13\" macbook pro (and sometimes ipad mini) for easy access when getting through TSA. Overall the bag has been excellent! The only concern is how long the pull out handle will last along and the 4 wheels (the handle doesn't feel too sturdy, especially when having my dog carrier on top of the bag). When having my dog carrier on top I will roll the bag by holding it with two hands and do my best to not apply to much pressure to only the handle when pushing.. this is also my first 4 wheeler bag and I have not always heard the best about 4 wheelers lasting long. However, I do not plan to check this bag ever so I'm hoping within my care I can keep it to last relatively well. Very happy with my purchase so far!",

                "reviewText": "Totally love it! The size, the quality, the whole kit and kaboodle. It does have an odd chemical type of smell, so I'm airing it out. It's brand new with tags. The other thing is the fabric pattern does not show up in the pics like it does in person. There is a stripe in the pattern that you can't see. It looks online as if there is some shading with the color, but that shading is actually printed on the fabric. I've taken pics so you can see. It's still a nice piece of luggage, and I am quite pleased.UPDATE after a 4 day trip and using it on the airlines: Still love the color and the ability to pack in clothes. If it's packed too much, though, it likely will have to be checked or valeted because it's too deep (\"fat\") to make it in the airline baggage size checker. I had to valet it on the smaller flights. I love the way it rolls - it's not cumbersome, and it doesn't try to fall over like one of my other bags that I just threw off the balcony because I hated it so much LOL. The frosted pocket that snaps inside - FAIL - what a disappointment - the snap came off the first time, and I used extreme caution so it wouldn't break. It fell right off on the table. Knocking it down a star because of that. But, it is a nice looking and very useful bag that you can spot a mile away, so I'm still happy with it. I just know now how to pack it properly for airlines.",

If you extent it it might not fit in most over head airplanes. I had a hard time getting it into an AA plane over head because of the weight I put in it, they will do the valet check on the small planes which is nice. It rolls on all 4 wheels and has a lot of packet space. Wish I had the under the seat to go with it!",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately I don\u2019t have enough time to return this carry on bag or to get a replacement. The color is lovely, the overall look of the bag is exactly what I was hoping for, it looks like it has plenty of space for a multi day trip, however, there was a huge tear in the stitching on the side. Not really sure what happened, I was able to repair it somewhat by hand stitching it, which luckily I know how to do, so I could use it for my trip but am not thrilled to have spent this much to have a damaged product arrive that needed fixing and I don\u2019t have any other feasible options to use this short notice.Hopefully the rest of the bag holds up okay with actual use. :/ it\u2019s also missing the locking mechanism for the zippers. Overall I like the bag but am questioning how durable it will actually be in the long run.",
