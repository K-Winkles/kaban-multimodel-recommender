                "reviewText": "Great product, it's lined on the interior to protect your belongings and has a strap on one side to secure clothing. Enough pockets to hold my larger toiletries (hairbrush, toothbrush, etc...) The locking mechanism is great, seems very durable. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars only because the case is listed as scratch resistant and I already have some white marks on it after a single trip, I thought it would be a little more durable against this. Outside shell is overall very good and protects your belongings. Pop-up handle works well and it's easy to use. I would definitely buy another product from this company, these seem very well made.",

                "reviewText": "Stay away from this product.It did not even last one trip.Worked and performed well on the journey out.Packed and headed home after not touching the bag fir a week. Arrived at my seat and the telescoping handle would not go down the final step. So I was standing there in the seat row pounding away at the handle and pushing the button while an entire plane load of people paraded past me. I tried opening the case and accessing the handle from the inside, to no avail. My next move was to flip it upside down and position the case between the seats with the exposed handle on the floor of the cabin.I shoved, and pushed and even jumped on top of the case.Everyone boarding the plane was having a good laugh. My final solution was to just break off the telescoping handle and shove it between my seat and the wall of the cabin, throw this bag in the overhead for my Eight hour flight across the Pacific.If you enjoy looking like a fool in front of a plane full of people this piece is for you.Just avoid this product, it is a sad piece.",

Like me, you may be finding that most carry-on spinners are a little too big in at least 1 dimension. LOOK NO MORE!This is a great bag. It's made of polycarbonate, so it's strong and very light. It's balanced and doesn't tip over. It rolls great! It has compartments and zippers but also doesn't waste any space. It also features a reprogramable TSA lock.I've traveled with it 3 times now and love it.It's perfect. Buy it.",
