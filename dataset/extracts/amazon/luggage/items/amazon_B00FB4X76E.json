                "reviewText": "It was a few days before March 13th and I really needed a new luggage for my trip to Japan. My previous two roller carry on lost a wheel and was a pain to bring along because it had no spinners. I found this decently priced luggage around Amazon and I decided to test my luck and see if this would hold up for the trip. It was also available for prime shipping and I got this relatively fast so I was able to pack all my clothes in a timely manner.I traveled to Japan for two weeks and the luggage was definitely a good choice. It fitted 3 pairs of jeans, 10 shirts, 10 undershirts, 10 boxers, 15 pairs of socks, 2 sweat pants, and a small bag of cosmetics. The handle and wheels seemed flimsy but it survived the entire trip no problem. As long as the roads were smooth there was no problem traveling with the luggage but it does get tough to pull when the road is bumpy which resorted me to having to to tilt the luggage and carry on it's two wheel.There was also no problem at customs or bag checks as the bag was the correct size for all domestic and international flights to bring on board the plane. I definitely will be using this again for more future trips.",

The lightweight nature of the suitcase is nice when you are carrying it, but it falls over often and it isn't very stable. Fits well in overhead bins and the orange color stands out well when I'm looking for it on the baggage carousel though!",

Within the first 10 minutes the pull out handle broke and would not go back in. I had to turn it upside down and slam it on the ground everytime I needed to stow it. Safe to say I'm sending the other one back. It is lightweight and not bad looking, and at least covered the immediate need.",

I like the various pockets, they are well placed and of sufficient size to give me ready access to all the things I need to get to when traveling. What I\u2019m not as thrilled with is that this suitcase has a strong tendency to tip over because the wheels are so close together. I\u2019ve also had issues with the wheels not being able to freely rotate, making it difficult to pull. I often feel like I\u2019m just dragging the suitcase along the floor and there aren\u2019t wheels at all.",
