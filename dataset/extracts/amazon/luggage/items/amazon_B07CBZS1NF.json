                "reviewText": "I just travelled by plane with my new set and it was perfect! My favorite color, and it makes it easy to identify on the luggage carousel. The smallest was perfect for the overhead bin, and I nested the medium inside the small so I'd have an extra bag to come home with in case I was bringing a bunch of stuff back. The 360 wheels move so smoothly, so they were very easy to navigate. I could put my personal item (a laptop backpack) on top of the carry on to make it easy - no back pain or awkwardness of items falling off my shoulders, and so easy to move (unlike the older wheel styles that you have to drag and the weight pulls your arm/shoulder down. Effortless and cute! I also love the protection of the hard case, that one side zips up inside to contain all the smaller packed items, and that the luggage opens in half (at the mid-point) so you can evenly distribute your clothes, making them easier to access. The rubber guards on the corners protected from wear and tear and the built in combo lock that is TSA approved/accessible was a huge plus. Icing on the cake: all three pieces nest for easy storage.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far the best luggage I ever owned. The material is durable and quite scratch resistant based on my application thus far. I recently used this set on an international trip and I am really impressed. Its also the smoothest rolling set of luggage wheels I've ever experienced. The zippers hold up really well under extreme load. On my recent trip, I was on the move for about a week with only the carry on and boy oh boy it held up strongly. 10/10 recommend. Great for the price. I utilized and luggage cover for the 28' and the 24' so this may have aided with the scratch prevention. Happy with the purchase and I love the colour!",

Do yourself a favor and spend more money.I am currently in the first week of my three week tour of Europe. It\u2019s going to be a nightmare moving this around now on my next flights (multiple) and train rides (multiple).I honestly was concerned at the low price but my friend convinced me otherwise - she actually mentioned it\u2019d probably break so go cheap first. Guess she was right.I wish I hadn\u2019t listened and spent more money on a better product. Other than it breaking immediately, it seemed like a good product. The wheels did look weak and... well... here we are \ud83d\ude43*** update Sept 12th ***Just got back to U.S. on my 9/10th day (third flight) the second and third wheels broke. That was a major pain going across cobble stone in Denmark and through the trains of Germany.On my return flight on day 21, 24 hrs of travel, I finally lost my last wheel. Seen in my last photo. He made it so far. I thought he was going to make it home. I cried and we are holding a funeral for him.Do yourself a favor - spend a little more money and get something better. Honestly, I am decently strong (like... a gorilla \ud83d\ude0e) and carried this by hand through streets, trams, buses, planes, up stairs, down stairs etc. It was tough. For a normal person, it would have been impossible.** October 13th Update **I have been given a full refund. LETS GO!",
