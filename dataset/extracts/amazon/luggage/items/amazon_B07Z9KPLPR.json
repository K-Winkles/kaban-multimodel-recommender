I don't travel out of the country anymore and going places for just a weekend with duffel bags has now become a hassle...I decided to buy a set of suitcase but waited until Prime week to get them(I was looking for and really wanted to buy the 360\u00b0 spinners but their prices are out of the budget...for now). I came across these...I read the reviews and decided to purchase them. It's the little things for me. They really are a nice looking set of bags and every single compartment has TWO zippers \ud83d\ude31, which I didn't notice when I was looking at them online. Lol it may not be a big deal to y'all, but it definitely is to me(IYKYK\ud83d\ude43). I absolutely love this set more because of the zippers. Lol whomever designed these definitely had me in mind. THANK YOU\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe!!! Royal Blue is my color\ud83e\udd70 but they cost a bit more than the others...I didn't feel like paying extra bc they're not the swivel kind that I really wanted in the first place...Anyway, so far I've traveled once with the biggest and smallest ones. I only plan to use the smallest bag for my neck pillow, iPad, and other personal items(it's big enough that everything fits just fine \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe). The bigger one held up well. The only issue of course, is that it got dirty...which is inevitable. Other than that, so far so good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe.If you're looking for a more affordable, yet stylish, lightweight and well~made suitcase, this set is for \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffeyou\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffe. Satisfaction IS guaranteed! Happy Shopping!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd17",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Review after 4 years: Terrific luggage. Durable, roomy & attention getting.See pics, hints & updates",
                "reviewText": "This US Travelers New Yorker luggage set is a home run if you have realistic expectations. I toiled over which set to buy and went cross-eyed reading all the mixed bag reviews. After much deliberation, and thanks in part to a sale, I settled on this set (actually bought two sets ). Here is a breakdown of what all the other reviews taught me, a synopsis of our experiences with this luggage and a helpful hint to increase the look and durability of these suitcases:First off, the luggage looks very upscale; the front side is vibrantly colored (in this case royal blue), and the tightly woven fabric has good fit & finish. There are two metal zipper pulls on each compartment which is convenient, however the zippers themselves and the pull attachments are adequate but not of superior durability. The bags are generously sized, deeper than our previous (Atlantic brand) set and this allows the bags to swallow a lot more stuff yet remain portable.The insides are fully lined and contain straps to secure the contents. While the lining is thin and not the highest quality, it is a nice feature on a set in this price range; our previous set cost twice as much fifteen years ago and had no lining.Each of the pull pieces have two nicely functioning wheels and an expandable handle to let you drag the bag behind; you can even attach the duffel bag onto an extended handle via a back strap. Speaking of the handles- although none of them have given out on us yet, these handles are a bit awkward to use and will possibly be the first things to act up as they are the flimsiest part of this luggage set. The farther you telescope them out, the more likely they feel as if they are going to break under the weight of the bag, especially if the bags are filled.HINT: A good hint with which I can \"pay it forward\" is to Scotch-Guard Fabric them prior to using. I picked up a can and sprayed the sets prior to use and that five dollar investment is helping these bags avoid all sorts of staining and discoloring at the hands of the baggage claim and after repeated uses they still look great.Overall, this set was a terrific buy for my family's needs and should be the same for most casual travelers as well.Again, have realistic expectations from what a set of this price should deliver and I think you will be pleased. I posted a few pics of this luggage set so you can visualize what they look like and how they all fit or \"nest\" together during storage. Should there be any noteworthy experiences (good or bad) as we use them in the future, I will be sure to update. Good luck.UPDATE: 7/2016: After several more uses, this luggage set continues to function well and look very nice. The handles I mocked in my initial write up still feel a bit flimsy but they are holding up fine. The only other minor issue we have seen is that the metal skeleton between the lining and the outer fabric that helps keep the suitcase's shape is stretching the fabric in the corners of some of the pieces...it is not yet effecting the performance but it looks a bit unsightly on the black bottom-side of some of the pieces. No big deal and I continue to be impressed with this set.UPDATE 11/2019: 4+ years in and this luggage set is still going strong. No handles have broken, the wheels (although not 360 spinners) work great and they continue to look almost new.My sister in law bought the exact same set for her and her family and also loves it. I've upped from four to five stars because there have been no durability issues.",

                "reviewText": "Hello,I travel often for work, and as one might imagine I tear through luggage fairly quickly. I'm starting to think that airlines have luggage throwing contests...hah. Anyhow, I purchased this luggage set twice. The first one lasted one trip, at which point one of the wheels broke. I contacted customer support, and they immediately refunded me and sent a packing slip so I could return the product. At that point, I purchased another which has lasted two trips. The customer service process was quick, easy, and respectful. No drama at all and I'm very much pleased.The zippers are sturdy and I don't expect to ever see it break. The lining itself is also good quality, I'm not at all worried that the bag might rip even if I overpack a bit. I'm really not sure HOW the wheel broke on the first one....they do seem pretty sturdy (compared to others that I've gone through over the years). If one wheel gets caught though and doesn't turn right, it will just scrape and flatten, thus snowballing your problems.Conclusion: Great luggage set if you're on a budget. I actually like it better than some of the $400-500 Samsonite sets that I've purchased in the past...and broken.",

After it's maiden flight, we found upon picking up our luggage off the carousel, that the side was dented in and there was a cut in the side fabric (as seen in photo). The internal side support is not robust and as it's a u-channel, the support bar cut through the fabric. The side fabric is very thin unlike the front panel. I gave this a 3 star only because it's nice for the cost and feel this would be ok for ground travel but would not recommend for air travel due to it's low durability hence the 1 star on this point.",
