                "reviewText": "I just bought 3 of these little \"rollers\", as you can see! Pink and blue for my 7 and 10 year old granddaughters and the beige for myself. I absolutely LOVE them, however...here comes my \"rant\"! They came in a plastic bag that was secured in a taped up box which I thought was very good protection, uh, not so much! There is a stupid, and I mean STUPID \"plastic protective film\" on them that literally took me over 20 minutes EACH to peel off! Sure, there's a corner at the top front that says, Peel here, or something like that, but as you're peeling it, matter how slow or careful you are, it tears comes off in smaller pieces which makes it FRUSTRATING and RIDICULOUS! I always read reviews before I purchase here and I did read a few about the plastic film but I thought maybe people were exaggerating, but, no, I was wrong and I AGREE!! All-in-all, I still love these little rollers and I know my granddaughters will as well!!",

It is lightweight, perfect size to flit under the bed for storage, held 10 dresses (with hangers) and 4 pair of shoes, was easy to maneuver getting on and off the ship and through baggage claim, and was extremely easy to spot. I am VERY pleased with this purchase and will purchase additional ones for the other members of my family!",
