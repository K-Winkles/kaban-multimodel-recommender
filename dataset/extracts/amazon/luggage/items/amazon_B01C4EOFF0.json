                "reviewText": "21\u201d size \u2013 UPDATED REVIEWI have been traveling with this bag for 9 months now and have run this bag through 18 flights to-date. I will try to answer as many questions as I can in this review.I just measured my bag: Exterior dimensions of the \u201c21 inch\u201d bag: 22 x 15 x 8\" INCLUDING THE WHEELS and hand handle with the telescoping handle folded in.Internal packing area: 15.5 x 13.5 x 6.0\". This can be increased to 15.5x13.5x7.0. by unzippering the center zipper. G, which is a good idea for road travel but not a good idea for flying. If you fly a large jetliner, it makes no difference. If, however, you are flying a regional jet, they have a depth limit of 9\". It is easy to stuff your bag in such a way that the soft side presses out more than 9\". If you don't extend your case, it is easy to squish the side to make it fit, but if you have extended the case to 9\" and then overstuff it, the bag will wind up checked on those \"RJ\" jets.Will it fit overhead?: Most aircraft? - Yes. Small regional jets?- Actually it will but they may make you gate check it anyway. Will this fit under the seat: Usually not.The outer pocket is good for items up to 13.5 x 12.5 x 1\". The pocket is actually 15\" high but because of the zipper placement, I call the useful pocket height 13.5\"There has been a lot of speculation in the reviews as to how much this case can hold and how durable it will be in the long run. The durability of the canvas-like cloth exterior has been excellent and it wipes clean when the airlines are abusive.In the 9 months that I have owned this bag, it has been on 18 flights; some as carry on and a few as checked luggage. It has been to the Mountains of Montana, the remote southern deserts, and the \"wilds\" of Las Vegas. Despite the wobbliness of the handle, it holds up very well and is easy to operate. I am careful to pack right and I've never had a tip-over issue. The wheels have worked well on tile, linoleum, carpet, concrete, asphalt, dirt, and snow. My typical load is 5 days' worth of clothes, toiletries, and \"paperwork,\" plus a large (weekly planner type). And, I have never opened the expansion section.Isn't 15.5 x 13.5 x 6.0\" rather small? Well, that depends on how and what you pack. If you lay your clothes in and load as you go, then yes, this is a small bag. However, if you pack like me (roll everything up then pack it, then hang your clothes up on the other end) this bag is all you need. On a trip a few weeks ago, I packed 6 days-worth of clothes, including a suit and a change of shoes, into the main compartment without extending it. I put my 3-1-1 (toiletry bag) in the side pocket with my itinerary and placed this bag in the overhead. Without the suitcoat, I could have gotten a laptop in there too. As was, I was able to carry a \"pad\" and a few small souvenirs or snacks in the side pouch. If you carry curlers or a blow dryer, though, you will only get 2-3 days-worth in there. Also, pack evenly or the bag may be off balance when standing.Empty weight: 5.5 poundsLength from wheels to top of extended handles: 42\u201dOutside pockets: 1 (the other zipper is to expand the capacity)Are the wheels removable? NoWill a laptop fit in the front pocket?: No, but an iPad will.How many total wheels? 4Can I use a TSA padlock?: Yes",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight & great for international travel",
                "reviewText": "I bought this set for a trip from MN to Japan this spring. I don't travel often and didn't feel like dropping a huge amount of money, but I also have unrealistic expectations of everything going wrong (cue images of zippers ripping apart, bags flying open, handles and wheels cracking off, etc etc). With these semi-opposing thoughts in mind, I did a lot of research on various options until I had it narrowed down. This set was the winner for me based on size and weight, and ended up being perfect!Some highlights:- Sturdy but lightweight. There were no issues with any part of the luggage traveling internationally, and it's lightweight enough that I wasn't concerned with my bags going over the weight limit for checked luggage.- Spinner wheels have held up great so far and are SO CONVENIENT. If you haven't had luggage with spinner wheels, please try them. It was so ridiculously easy to glide through the busy airport and train stations.- All the pieces fit together nicely. They arrived nestled together like a trio of boring, useful Russian dolls. On my way to Japan, I fit everything I needed for 13 days into the medium bag (25\") and put the medium bag in the large bag (29\"). When I got to my destination I only had one large piece of luggage to worry about, and I got to go home with an entire suitcase full of goodies.Other notes:- My cat decided these are really cool and fun to scratch, and after about 5 days of daily claw use there wasn't any major damage.- The handle doesn't feel like the sturdiest thing in the world. I'm pretty short, so to drag the 29\" bag around I didn't need to extend the handle at all. The others I have been careful with, but I haven't really encountered any extendable handles that have felt extremely durable, so who knows.- I do wish there were more pockets, either on the front or back or inside, but I really enjoy pockets and compartments and having my things organized, so that's just a personal preference and didn't ruin my life.Overall, these are great pieces of luggage and I'm looking forward to using them more. They may not be a lifelong investment, but they do seem like they'll hold up for at least a dozen more long trips.",

                "reviewText": "I have struggled finding the right fit of luggage for the frequent travel I do. (All within the US.) I wanted the options of sizes depending on short or longer trips, and these gave me that at a great price. Face it, even the most expensive luggage takes a beating. I prefer the \"lid\" opening of these soft sides as they're easier to open in tight spaces. Last week I took the middle sized piece and had more than enough room for a full week & it held up great through several legs and plane changes. It still looks new! (I have the navy...a bit easier to spot on the luggage belt.) Next week is just a two-day & I'll take the smaller carry-on for that. When I need meeting materials, the largest size should be ideal for that. They roll well and I like that they fit inside each other for storage. I also bought the \"underseat\" piece that matches though I haven't used it yet.",
