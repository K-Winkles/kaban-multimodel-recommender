                "reviewText": "I already own two carry on sized versions of this suitcase, so I knew what I was getting when I bought it. This line of luggage is perfect for people who travel a few times a year and need a case that they can cram full of vacation gear and still manage to get it all back home in one piece.The hard sided exterior does well against the beating it takes on its journey through the airport. It seems thin when you get it, but once it is filled with clothing you will see that it is much sturdier than it appears. The zippers are strong and don't stick easily even under pressure of a full case. The wheels operate smoothly on a variety of surfaces from the airport parking lot pavement to the metal grates of the people movers to the carpet in the check in lobby. The handle is easily adjustable to your desired height and usage, and works well when rolling it upright through the terminal. So why did I mention it is best for people who travel a few times a year as opposed to all travelers?While the hard case is sturdy, I believe that heavy usage will eventually cause it to crack. It isn't as sturdy as more expensive luggage is. The zippers while great are known to have quality control issues, so while mine have been fine, you may end up with one that has a wandering stitch that can lead to a loose zipper tread. The handles also are not as sturdy as more expensive brands. And while the wheels are durable, the wheel wells drag and wear down when pulling them diagonally as opposed to rolling them upright.All this being said, for most people this line of luggage will work perfectly fine. For my uses they are perfect. I also really enjoy the variety of color options. As long as you aren't someone who is constantly catching planes for business trips and the like, you probably won't have to worry about the issues above. And at this price, I think the possible shortfalls are worth the risk.So from my standpoint, this is a great suitcase for vacation and light travel. Just think about the volume of travel you do when purchasing it to make sure you are getting the right product for your needs.",

I did not realize how poorly made that was. This bag feels more sturdy and better finishes. It rolls smoothly. It zips smoothly. The dividers don\u2019t feel paper thin. There are nice details on the exterior as well. Bought this as a \u201cused-packaged new\u201d and I don\u2019t believe it was used (perhaps returned?). Great price for a great bag!",

The outer shell is plasticky and does flex a little under pressure, but so far it has held up with no damage. Similarly - the handlebar feels a little flimsy, but it hasn't broken yet. The interior lining fabric that zips up the top storage area is very flimsy and tears easily. Mine tore after just one trip with this bag, but fortunately that doesn't impact the bag's functionality in any major way. Overall it rolls well and generally works fine as a carry-on.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, first of all, I'm a middle-aged lady who travels alone, mostly on flights to see my grandkids and sometimes for academic conventions or the like. I purchased the case about a year ago and had suspicions about \"Kenneth Cole\" and \"suitcase\" in the same sentence. I mean, I think of suitcases, and I think Samsonite or names like that--not Kenneth Cole! I guess you could say, I was suspicious about how well this item could actually perform in real life! The review you are about to read was inspired by my most recent trip (July 2015) from Northern California to Portland and back via plane, taxi, light transit, and car. I actually made a note of these items as I unpacked my suitcase:5 tank tops2 t-shirts2 lightweight knit cardigans3 pair yoga pants2 bras and 4 under wear1 pair shortsBathing suitSheath dress2 pair socksSneakersFlannel jammie pantsCrop jeansKnit skirtMakeup/toiletries bag (trifold but stuffed full!)Barrel brush, mini hair dryer, curling iron2 magazines, 2 bags of candy,and 2 stuffed toysTHE PRO'S*Lightweight, even when packed full*Fits easily in overhead bin (it is the newest \"officially acceptable\" size for the airlines)*Wheelies spin easily & are not cumbersome in airport/plane aisles (I travel mostly in commuter planes with skinny aisles & teensy o/h bins)*Easy to put in out of trunk of car or take on Portland light rail*Small enough to store in the back corner of my closet until next timeTHE CON'S*The handle, when fully extended, feels quite wobbly and rickety (in fact, I predict this is the first thing that will eventually fail)*The zipper doesn't seem very high quality--but so far so good--again, I'm surprised it has not failed yet)*While I have taken it on 8 flights (all using carry-on), I'm not sure how well this case would hold up if regularly checked through and tossed into baggage carousels by careless/busy/over-worked baggage handlers*No external pockets --it's a solid body all the way around. So if u are used to stuffing magazines or boarding passes or the like into pockets, you'll miss them!OVERALLI've been really pleased with this little case. It holds about a week's variety of clothing and supplies and has been a joy to use! I'm quite fond of my little traveling partner. If you get this bag at a good sales price and take moderately good care of it, you should be satisfied with your purchase--I know I am!",
