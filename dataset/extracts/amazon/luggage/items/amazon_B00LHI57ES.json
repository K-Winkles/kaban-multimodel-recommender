It does get scuffed easy but nothing a little bit of washing can't fix. I bought 2 others- the black and orange which is also sturdy but the yellow cracked under 50lb of weight and the wheel came off. AT HOME!! It didn't even make the stairs. I wonder if the manufacturer is different or if the color has a strengthening element to it. The plastic on the pink and orange is stiffer while the yellow bows and bends easily. I love this enough to have 2 sets of pin and two sets of black and orange. I stuffed them to 70lbs which made them wobbly and the extended handles creak but survived the airports without damage.",

It\u2019s been to DC, Houston, NY, South Carolina, Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands in the last 6 months. Other reviews have suitcases that the handle breaks off or the wheels break off for other brands but this one is fine. I was worried but this was well worth the $80 I spent! The only thing is one of the zippers inside stopped working but I think that was also user error and I could probably get it fixed. But overall I\u2019m very happy with this set and highly recommend!",

May buy again because my daughter likes them, but only a top name brand.I did not open the suitcase until the night before my daughter was schedule to leave for Florida. I was not myself as I had a stroke recently. There was a big crack around one of the wheels when I opened it to pack my daughter's clothes. I was left with no other choice than to use this suitcase for her trip. It was too big and not sturdy, which made the manuevering a bit difficult especially with the broken wheel.On my return I called Amazon and explained to them what had happened, and they approved the return. I am waiting to see if my refund will be processed.",
