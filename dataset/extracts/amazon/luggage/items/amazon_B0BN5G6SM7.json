It took it on American Airlines and it fit no problem in the overhead and the matching tote fit under the seat as my personal item. It\u2019s a really good size for me for 2-3 days.I haven\u2019t used the lock on the zipper yet but it\u2019s nice to have. The zippers open and close smoothly, too. I was worried it would get dirty easily since it\u2019s white, but the tote is like a nylon material and it still looks brand new after multiple trips. Same w the rolling suitcase.Been using it for any 2-3 day trips to visit family and it\u2019s such a nice set to travel with. Beats bringing mismatched totes and book bags!",

I had multiple ladies ask me where I bought it. The duffle holds a ridiculous amount of items too! Great price, great quality and I will likely buy a set for my girls and husband!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this set for a trip to Mexico. I used the medium suitcase & the expandable tote bag on my trip. I was able to overstuff the suitcase & the zipper worked very well. I checked this bag & it still looks like new after 4 different flights & loading in & out of the car for 8 days. It was extremely lightweight & the handle expanded to a perfect height (I'm 5' 7\"). The handles seem very strong & heavy duty. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star for maneuverability was it didn't wheel as easily on carpet as the tile floors - which makes sense. There is a zipper pouch and a zipper to close off 1/2 the suitcase which helped to separate the clean/dirty clothes. The tote bag worked so well as my carry on - perfect size even if flying with the worst airline, Frontier. There are slots & pockets on the outside for storage as well as a waterproof inside zipper pouch & 2 slot pouches which housed my sunglass case & phone. It's just a great size. The outside slot slides over the suitcase handle seamlessly and made walking through the airport a breeze. Only room for improvement would be to have a nice shoulder pad on the long strap instead of just the strap itself. Once you check the suitcase, you have to carry that & the strap was just a little uncomfortable. Overall, I am exceptionally please with these 2 pieces of the set. I hope the others work just as well. Added bonus, the colors are just really a beautiful duo of dark navy blue and the copper or suede color trims. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "This is a lovely set; the design, style, and color (I selected white) set it apart from the sea of traditional black suitcases.The duffle bag material is quite smooth and it easily slides over the retractable handle. The duffle also has several exterior pockets that make accessing a wallet, chapstick, gum, and/or phone easy. The bottom expands to allow for more room.I flew round trip with Frontier and had no issues with the suitcase as my carryon or the duffle as my personal item. I wasn\u2019t size checked and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to check either item myself, but wouldn\u2019t worry too much about taking either on a future flight. If the duffle is checked by staff in the future, the smooth material will likely help it slide into the sizer thing.The hard shell on the suitcase itself is a little thin, but for someone who only flies three or four times a year, I anticipate this lasting a while but also fully expect it to get dinged up easily. I love that it opens in the center and has a zipper to separate each side.Well worth the $100 or so for the set.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this luggage set. This is the 1st hardcover luggage I've owned and I wasn't sure if I'd like it but this is perfect for a 3-4 day trip. Lightweight, durable, and the wheels are great - love that they easily glide in all directions. Also, in the past any time I tried to stack a bag or backpack on a roller bag it would tip over - not this one! Makes solo travel WAY easier!! The duffel/carry-on bag is amazing too. When you zip out the bottom to expand it it's HUGE. It's been perfect for road trips and cramming a family of four's toiletries inside. The price was so great I was nervous the quality would be cheap but it looks great and has done very well on 2 trips for me so far using it as carry-on luggage.",

This set seemed inexpensive and was a lot better looking than the others I\u2019d see in this price range. Love the matching tote and slides right onto the handle and the toiletries bag is a great added bonus.Only concern is how dirty it might get during traveling, but that\u2019s likely to be expected with a lighter colored suitcase. I don\u2019t travel via plane very often so that\u2019s fine for me.",
