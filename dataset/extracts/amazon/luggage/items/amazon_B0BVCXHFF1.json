I love how One side is zippered off so if you are sharing with somebody else, it makes it super easy to separate things.It rolls very smoothly and makes a great carry-on bag! The cupholder is decent as well but make sure the weight is distributed properly so it doesn\u2019t fall over!Would recommend for a nice carry-on!",

I hate checking my bags at the airport and have been in the market for a new and improved carry on luggage, so when I saw this pop up in my feed, I knew this was going to be the perfect replacement for me.The luggage itself is perfect. It is a perfect size to fit in overhead bins on an airplane. The handle is sturdy and strong. It does not feel flimsy like it would break unless it was really damaged badly. The wheels turn three hundred sixty degrees which is something that I always need because when I am walking, I like to wheel my luggage upright. Overall, good quick trip luggage to get around. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "This bag maximizes the space available within the airline carry on size limitations. It takes up the entire 22x14x9 limits including wheels and handles. It includes a zipper that goes around the entire outside of the luggage that will allow it to expand approximately 1 more inch presumably for when you are not using it as a carry on or when the airline isn't paying close attention to the size.It has a divider in the center with zippered pockets to keep your clothing and items organized during your trip. Also included is a built-in cup holder which may come in very handy during long airport waits. The wheels roll nicely even on carpet and the telescoping handle extends more than 20 inches beyond the top of the luggage for easy pulling without needing to bend over. I haven't used it on a trip yet, but I see no quality issues with it.",
