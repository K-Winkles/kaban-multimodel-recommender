                "reviewText": "I was willing to try these on our trip with Southwest Airlines, but 2 of the 4 pcs would need checked. It looked like the 2 smaller ones & tote were small enough to carry on, but with the handle and wheels the 24\" was actually 25.5\" tall. The back is thin as to be expected at this price. It did have an interior liner to keep stuff falling out if it the outer back ripped during transit. The compartments we're large and the front was really nice, but with .3 out of every 100,000 (30,000) checked bags reporting theft, we need to carry on as much as possible. This luggage just wouldn't allow that. I would also worry it'd be easy to cut into. The tote was roomier than expected. All toiletries would most likely fit inside.",

                "reviewText": "When packing for a trip in a few days I found out that my suitcase was broken so I quickly came on Amazon and found these beauties! I ordered the 4-piece set in purple and the color is amazing, I love it!!! It is a very nice dark purple so it will hide dirt and wear and tear nicely!Seems sturdy; hasn't fallen over when standing upright. Wheel maneuver nicely and all zippers, handles, etc. are in good working order and easy to manipulate. I highly recommend this luggage set (my other half has the same in a different color and has had it several years w/out any problems). With a price like this you really can't go wrong purchasing this item!",

We are not huge travelers at this point in our lives but it's been a while since we purchased a set and just needed something to travel with a few times a year. Under 100.00 for this 4 piece is perfect. We looked at soo many other options, fancy ones, hard shells etc decided to go with just a standard set.. it really provides all the room we need and serves it's purpose. We can comfortably pack for our family of four -2 adults, a teen boy and younger girl for about a week to 10 days with this size set. Handles seem sturdy, the zippers are made well, has your average buckles, nets and liners on the inside. Glad we went with this set and would absolutely buy again.",

My biggest complaint is that they do not stand on their own if you have things inside. Maybe my packing skills need to improve, but the thing just falls over and cannot balance when you\u2019ve got stuff in it. Not the biggest deal, but frustrating when you need to use both hands and it tips right over.",
