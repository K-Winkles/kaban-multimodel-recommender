All pieces appear free of flaws, zippers all work well. The largest piece is very roomy & will hold a lot so will have to watch the weight closely for checking it. The smallest piece is very small, barely an overnighter, but will work nicely for the [day before arrival] for our cruise. I love this color, very dark shade of Teal (as pictured). Maneuvers effortlessly on our hardwood flooring. First-time buyer of a \"hard-sided\" set I am surprised how soft & pliable it is & just hope it withstands the airlines rough baggage handlers. The lock mechanism is easy enough, but seems cheaply made so I do worry about malfunction after it gets banged around in checked luggage.",

No dents thus far, seems durable enough for general use (anything will dent if abused), the locks are a nice touch, sturdy large zippers, wheels haven't broken and work smoothly, no issues with the telescoping handles. The duffle bag is durable - good zippers and able to be used as a carry on. The backpack is very cool - lots of zippered storage areas as well as internal pockets, it's padded for electronics and can fit a remarkable amount of items and yet still small enough to be used as a \"personal item\" when flying - I put it underneath the airplane seat in front of me and still have a little room for my 6 ft frame sized legs.",

                "reviewText": "The COOLIFE Luggage Expandable Suitcase 3 Piece Set offers a set of three suitcases in various sizes, each designed to meet different travel needs. Here are some potential features and considerations for this luggage set:Features:PC+ABS Material: The use of PC (polycarbonate) and ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) materials offers a balance of durability, impact resistance, and lightweight construction. This combination makes the luggage sturdy enough to withstand rough handling during travel.Expandable Design: The expandable feature allows you to increase the luggage's packing capacity, making it convenient for packing extra items or souvenirs acquired during your trip.TSA-approved Lock: The inclusion of TSA-approved locks adds an extra layer of security, enabling TSA agents to inspect your luggage without damaging the lock.Spinner Wheels: Spinner wheels provide 360-degree mobility, making it easy to maneuver the luggage in any direction, even in crowded spaces like airports or train stations.Multiple Sizes: The set includes three different sizes - 20 inches, 24 inches, and 28 inches. This variety gives you options for different types of trips, from short getaways to longer vacations.Telescoping Handle: A telescoping handle allows you to adjust the height of the handle to suit your preference and comfort while pulling the luggage.Organizational Features: Look for internal compartments, zippered pockets, and garment straps to help keep your belongings organized and secure during travel.Considerations:Weight: While the PC+ABS material is generally lightweight, the overall weight of the luggage set might vary depending on the specific design and features. Be mindful of any weight restrictions imposed by airlines to avoid additional fees.Durability: Although PC+ABS material is durable, individual product construction and build quality can vary. Read customer reviews to assess the luggage's long-term durability and performance.Size and Storage: While having three different sizes is convenient, consider if the sizes fit your specific travel needs and storage space at home.Warranty and Customer Support: Check the manufacturer's warranty policy and the availability of customer support in case you encounter any issues with the luggage.As always, reading customer reviews can provide valuable insights into the actual performance and durability of the COOLIFE Luggage Expandable Suitcase 3 Piece Set. Additionally, check the product specifications and details on the manufacturer's website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",

                "reviewText": "I have used my set for a couple of trips. I have been able to pack my clothes and additional items with some adjustment. I previously used to soft sides cases that give a little. I did purchase a set of packing cubes to help with the harder sided case. The locking system worked well for the trips and did hold up to airline baggage system. However, at the moment I am having difficulties with opening the smaller case. The lock system is not letting me open the lock. I have tried all the directions to reset the system without success. I do like the luggage and found it easy to identify in the sea of black luggage. Will update if able to get the lock to open.",

                "reviewText": "When the product was first received we thought, \"great - the product arrived on time, looked great, was lite in weight and it was a 3 piece set.\" However, after 9 months of owning the set and on its second trip 1/2 of the paired wheels fell off of the large suitcase and I've reached out to see if either a wheel or large suitcase replacement could be sent. Still waiting for a response and the warranty has lapsed.The product's quality is already questionable but the responsiveness would make me question whether I would recommend the product. Incidentally, I may have missed it but on Coollife's web page I was not able to find a contact number for support. That in itself is telling.I'll update this review if I hear back from them.",

In the meantime, the three pieces of hard-side luggage are beautiful, easy to roll. The zippers seem very durable. The material inside the luggage feels like high quality. A backpack and duffel bag were included in the set and they appear really well made and seem to be very durable.As i said i won\u2019t use this luggage until the beginning of February. I will write a follow-up review after that trip.",
