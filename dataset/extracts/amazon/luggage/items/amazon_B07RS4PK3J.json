We even used the carry on instead of our older set because the quality and look was very nice! The color isbeautiful, style looks expensive and the cases were very sturdy. I was cautious due to other reviews saying they don't hold up. Ours did!! I did not dent or cave in from airport employees. We had 1 scratch. The inside fits WAY more than in looks at first glance. The different options to pack helped us separate shoes and keep our clothes secure. Don't pass these up, especially for the price",

They didn\u2019t dent or break in any way (they do feel a tad flimsy but I had no problems). The wheels work just fine but sometimes you have to adjust or go in a quick circle to get them back on track. I\u2019m glad I made the purchase. I think maybe some people just had bad luck with a bad batch or they are exaggerating the issue. Very spacious and even after stuffing it pretty well, it still only weighed like 35 pounds and had room for more. The carry on is perfect and the extra bags are sturdy and useful. I ordered a separate carry on for my daughter and she loves it! Order it! You\u2019ll be happy you did.",

Initially I provided a poor review as the order was incomplete (2 of 4 pieces arrived) and damage to one that arrived prior to Christmas. Well, after the review was posted (there was not anyone I could locate to follow up with or I would not have posted the review), a full set arrived within 2 days, it was perfect! I used for a 6 day vacation and it held up fine. No issues. I definitly think it is worth the money. It's hard to rate durability until you have had the itme for awhile but I gave a good rating as it did well on initial trip.So please void my earlier rating. I thank you kindly for your prompt attention and teh new luggage!I do suggest having contact for follow up posted with the product.Many thanks! Ronnie and Millie House",

                "reviewText": "I was going on a trip to Europe and needed a decent set of luggage so after looking around I decided on this one and at first I thought it was great. I liked the 4 wheels, it felt like normal luggage and I enjoyed the smaller bags. They were easy to pack and looked nice. But once my bag was packed, at 37 lbs I might add, the bag didn't roll so easily when up on 4 wheels. Then I started to notice the handle isn't very sturdy and felt flimsy when I had to move the bag a little harder. But whatever, minor details. The bags did great on the international flight. No damage caused and the blue didn't show any scuff marks. I seriously only walked around on cobblestones for an hour though before my bag was broken. It feels important to note I was in a group of 7, all of us with similar bags and on the same path for the same amount of time, and mine is the only bag that had problems. I wasnt even a full day into my Europe trip and my bag had failed. The wheel had been bent just a little out of place and the plastic around the wheel had been rubbed down. But the bag still rolled so I moved on with my life. Then we go to leave for our second location, this time with no cobblestone, and the wheel totally pops out of place. So now the bag isn't even able to roll properly and is basically just being drug around. We tried to fix it up but a week later when we left to come back home the bag was so non functioning I considered leaving it at the hotel and buying a new one. Maybe I just had bad luck because only my large Suitcase did this, I've taken the carry on size on two trips and while it feels semi flimsy it hasn't broken any wheels or given me the same nightmares.... All I'm saying is if you aren't going to be on a perfectly slick surface that's flat the whole time and youll be packing more than 20 lbs in your large suitcase, you may wanna look somewhere else. This just wasn't it for me.",
