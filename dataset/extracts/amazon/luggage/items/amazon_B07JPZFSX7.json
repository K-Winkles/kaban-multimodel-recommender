                "reviewText": "First off, I read other reviews about this bag missing the cup holder - it's important to READ the description closely before ordering. The detail page clearly states the cup holder is only on the small bag (carry-on), not on the medium or large size. The tag that comes with the luggage says the exact same thing, I'm uploading a photo of it. On a check-in bag you rarely need a cup holder anyway, as you check it in as soon as you get to the airport. It'd also be another thing to break when handled by the airport employees.This is an absolutely beautiful bag. I have always used the 28-29\" sized luggage bags for check-ins, but on my last trip to Europe I realized just how big and clumpsy it was to move around. So when one of the wheels broke on my then American Tourister Bon Air Spinner and I went looking for a new bag, I decided to go with this Swiss Gear in the 23\" size instead. I LOVE the looks on this one, which was one of the main pros for me, it also comes in awesome colors that will be very visible at the baggage claim. And yes, even if it's significantly smaller than my previous 28\" and I won't fit nearly as much in it, it will be so much easier to store, roll around, fit on the train, in the car, the taxi etc - just easier to travel with in general. I just have to learn to not bring as many gifts to my family. This Swiss Gear is expandable, something my previous bag wasn't, so that will help as well.It is extremely light weight!It rolls like a dream even when packaged with 45lb of stuff, much better than than my American Tourister. Same goes for the zippers, they're smooth like butter! The handle and \"button\" are also better than what I'm used to on previous luggage, there are no \"hiccups\", it's smooth, stable and very exact in its locking mechanism. No way to know how long it'll be this great, but for now I'm super happy with it.The only thing I'm missing are a couple of zippered pockets on the interior zippered \"lid\" between the two compartments. I had that on my previous bag and it was so convenient for smaller, flatter items. It's a minor thing so it won't affect the rating, this is definitely a 5 star luggage - and the price range is great too.",

They seem decently sturdy, the wheels move with ease at the airport. Very spacious and perfect sizes for the flight measurement restrictions. The green color is fabulous and makes for easy spotting on the luggage carousel! Highly recommend",

Some reviews mentioned them not being durable but this has held up great so far and it's really lightweight. I'm a heavy packer, so any weight to take off the actual bag the better. Very happy with this so far!",

                "reviewText": "I like this suitcase a lot. It\u2019s attractive, well sized for most airlines, the zippered side helps you organize loose objects in your bag without dumping them all over the place while zipping, and the lock has the capability to add a backup lock\u2014which I didn\u2019t use but did appreciate.I bought this item a couple of months before I would need it knowing that in one month I\u2019d have to fly 17 times. When I bought it I didn\u2019t think much about the cup holder\u2014who cares, right? But after a few five hour layovers I thought about it a LOT. It\u2019s a really handy feature to have in certain circumstances, but it also manages to be the biggest downside. The cup holder is NOT standard sized. It\u2019s exactly 2 and 1/8th inches across, making it great for a plastic water bottle but quite small for most travel mugs/tumblers/cups. I even struggled with a standard paper coffee cup (think large Starbucks cup) which was left hovering above the (disconnected) base support.In short: a great carry on. Awesome if you\u2019re basically living out of it. You\u2019ll come to be annoyed by the cup holder sooner or later, and hopefully my included measurement will help you find a cup that works for you.",

                "reviewText": "Nice bag that I have some durability concerns with. The bag would be great for a normal person that travels a couple of times a year. It's a well\" designed holds a ton of stuff. It will expand if needed. I regularly load up 40-50 pds in it. Problem is I fly a couple times at least each week and I fear that it may not be durable enough, especially handle, to survive the pounding I subject any bag too. Telescoping handle has too much flex when pushing bag and will probably be fist failure point. Still a really great bag for normal travelers just might not be robust enough for 100 flights a year. Hopefully I'm wrong!",
