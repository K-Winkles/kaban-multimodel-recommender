I also appreciate that they have a 2-year warranty on them! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f stars in my book!

Everything that this luggage came with was all we needed to pack for the both of us. I got the peach three-piece set. Everything was so spacious and durable . The carry-on bag held everything we needed for our two hour flight. The suitcase literally held all my clothes and my child\u2019s clothes, and fit right above our seats on the plane. I used the carry-on as a purse and it doubled as a diaper bag plus there\u2019s an extra toiletry bag that fits right inside the carry-on which held a lot too. This is the best purchase I\u2019ve gotten in a while and I highly suggest getting it for yourselves. Everything is lightweight, spacious, and durable and easy to roll. I cannot believe how much the three piece set could hold! Highly highly highly recommend! One cool thing about the suitcase is there is a combination lock for the zippers, and a secret compartment I fit all my pjs and shoes in. I just love this luggage.",
