                "reviewText": "I took a chance and purchased this small carryon, even though some reviewers said they had problems. Mine works fine, smooth function and no slipping. Tablet laptop section also good for documents . Enough room for extra shoes or sandals and enough casual clothes for 2 days at least, but not enough for puffy jackets. Outer compartments are roomy enough. Side port for usb is convenient and you supply the power inside the suitcase. This bag fits easily into overhead compartments. If you need to transport cpap, the case fits in the bag snuggly, not much extra room. I like this because the cpap is just a heavy shoulder bag to juggle. The back has the kind of strap to slide over another bag handle.I did purchase a \u201cused \u201c bag and saved about $20. It came in the original box with all tags intact and no flaws. I\u2019m over 70 so it was easier to manage on the plane. On some planes, it may be too wide to fit under an aisle seat, some of the set ups are narrow on the aisle. Very happy with the purchase.",

I guess the latest in luggage innovations is \"floating pockets\". Storage space that is suspended above the other items, but doesn't take up any cavity space.My Surface Pro X fits exactly in the larger \"over-pocket\", even with the detachable keyboard and inside my padded sleeve. Just stays there all comfy and secure. I love this little bag. I have a travel mouse, which takes up 3/4\" vertical spacehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H8YD8QH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 that is also perfect for the smaller pocket, with room to spare for my charger cords and earbuds.The outside triple pockets are great for my phone, neck wallet, and whatever else I want handy to grab. It's a short cord connection over from that small front zippered pocket to the external charger, too. Use your own external power bank inside. I'm just leaving one in there and recharging it between trips.Then, I have a bunch more space to pack toiletries and a change of clothes inside the cavity.It's truly amazing what will fit into this slim little roller bag. Speaking of rollers: that's the reason I switched to this one. It has spinner wheels instead of inline wheels. Makes a HUGE difference moving it around, especially if it's packed a little heavy. I had to switch from my inline wheeled one because is was awkward to move around, and it almost tripped me twice!! This little beauty almost dances along next to me!You look at this when you take it out of the box and think, \"Hmmm, not too much can go in that\". I was so very, very wrong.I read a previous review that said it was too large for under a Southwest aisle seat, and it might be a squidge too long, so your feet must be kept directly below your knees. I put my under-the-seat bag up in the bin if I have an aisle seat, anyway.One feature I love, also, is the strap across the back. This makes stacking it on a larger suitcase with the strap over the suitcase handle an easy job for moving the little \"baggage tower\" along.Kudos to whomever design this little dream of a carry-on.",

Yes, it is the right size but I did not like the large handles because it made it awkward to put in the overhead bin. Also did not like the thick padded compartment inside. It just takes up too much needed spaceThe handle is also flimsy so not sure the longevity of the suitcase",

                "reviewText": "I finally got this \u2018under the seater\u2019 to replace a tote bag as a carry-on bc I would always get a neck ache after airline travel from carrying atote bag on one shoulder. And I do not like backpacks. So I decided to try this! Love it overall. No more neck aches!It rolls so well (spinner wheels) and is very light weight. I almost paid the extra money for a Samsonite version, but I\u2019m glad I went with this one. I\u2019ve used it in and out of airports 5 or 6 times this year since I got it. So far it looks like it will hold up well. If it breaks, that\u2019s not a big deal bc it was relatively inexpensive. And it looks nice, not cheap!My only \u2018wish\u2019 is that it was configured more like a tote bag vs a suitcase. You need to lay it down to open it and get things out, and that isn\u2019t always convenient. But I still carry a light tote bag with me so I put stuff I might need more frequently in the tote bag. And put other stuff in this spinner bag. I can piggy back the tote bag onto this under the seater, so again, it saves my neck that way as well! I\u2019m glad I got it and wish I would have sooner.",
