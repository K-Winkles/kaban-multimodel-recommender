Turn the Dials to your desired combination (e.g.:8-8-8); 3. Switch the Reset Button to \"OFF\", and now you can open the lock with the new combination. Why would the handle of the luggage feel a bit shaky? After extensive testing, a slight degree of handle movement is to ensure long-term usage. Due to the principles of thermal expansion and contraction and the lateral forces, if the handle is too tight, it may become unusable and even cause damage. What should I do if there is an issue with the luggage received? For any issues in product & servicing, LUGGEX claims to will keep the luggage in repair for 3 years. Please let us know via the Amazon email of your order and the related team will respond within 12H. Is there supposed to be some sort of key included? The key is not included in the package, it is designed for the customs exam only, it's a standard TSA lock, only the customs have the key to open.",

I'm used to using zippered cases, so the two latches are new to me, but they seem sturdy (even though they are made of plastic) and the combination lock is nice, but definitely not necessary! The case looks good and professional and the wheels are smooth and rotate 360.",

Most in the last 10 years were Samsonite for Family and Business Travel. Last Samsonite Carry on lasted seven months before the wheel broke off two weeks ago and decided to give Luggex a try.Nice looking suitcase.Carry on feels very sold with no flex when loaded.Nice interior layout.Like the zipper less feature.Travels nicely around the house/driveway and seems very stable loaded. Will see when I put some miles on it during travel over the next two months.Updates to come after some travel\u2026",

                "reviewText": "We ordered 2 sets of this, 28\" and carryon, and the 26\" and carryon. We've used them for a couple of trips and loved them.They look and feel better than the average luggage by the usual brands. They appear higher quality than the other bags on the belt at baggage claim. The aluminum frame is awesome and the texture keeps them looking good. The built in TSA locks are super convenient.The only detractors would be that I find the Luggex logo plate a little tacky but that's just my opinion. Also the locks do get a little beat up, but just some scratches and it doesn't effect the lock functionality in any way. Neither of these are enough to lower my rating. 5 stars all the way.We have more trips planned including Hawaii in the spring. Can't wait to use these again.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these carry-on cases (separate orders), 20 inch size. Both appear to be well made for solid sided cases. The size is right for airline carry-on and they are half the weight of our older major brand carry-on's. The TSA locks were another reason for purchasing these cases. The color is true to what you see in the description.The main feature I liked was that these are none zippered cases and therefore appeared to be more secure. Upon receiving the cases I discovered that the latching/locking mechanism is plastic, not metal. Better than zippers but anyone with a screw driver could with some effort break the latch and gain access to the case. The latches are the only negative issue therefore the four star rating. If the latches were metal I would have given a five star rating.I investigated similar cases sold on Amazon by multiple vendors and they all seem to sell the same case with the same latching/locking mechanism. Sourcing is likely the same importer/distributor. That's OK, just business as usual for small businesses on Amazon which I like to support. So, choice really came down to price and delivery. SHOP SMALL BUSINESSThere are cases that appear to have metal latching/locking mechanisms but they are much more expensive which is to be expected for a higher quality product. So, in the end I RECOMMENT THIS CASE as I expect it to meet our needs and provide a sufficient level of security, better than zippered cases.I will update as to durability, etc. after using on an upcoming international trip in the near future.",
