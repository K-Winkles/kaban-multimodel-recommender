The color is very pretty and the size is perfect for overnight or the weekend. The suitcase can extend for more items. The rollers are great! Moves very easily and I wish they had these when I was younger and traveling! Convenient size and good material that keeps its shape and look. The handle comes out smoothly and easily. The zippers all work very well with no snags. Very happy with this suitcase and recommend it for others.",

They have been very durable and I've gone through lots and lots of trips with no issues at all. I absolutely recommend.",

It rolls well and I\u2019m 6 ft tall. It feels lightweight when full too. I like it a lot.",
