                "reviewText": "I keep telling my friends about it, so I figured it was finally time to make it official! This particular luggage ROCKS and is literally the best \"investment\" I have ever made. FIVE trips so far and I continue to be so grateful!! Background: I had TAG brand hard shell luggage (hard shell....the new \"it\" luggage) and this is a night and day difference. Hard shell SO overrated and problematic. This particular KC luggage is pretty, VERY identifiable off the airport luggage belt (black, but puffer design and easy to see gold zippers/extras) and I LOVE it! Super maneuverable and light and pretty w/out being too \"pretty\" - still very professional and subtle. Also, the zippers are quality! The extra expansion option and outside pockets are AMAZING. Again, even better in person than it looks online. HIGHLY recommend this luggage!!!",

I've packed these to the brim a couple of times and it's held up perfectly. They also fit mostly all airplane dimensions to the tee. The number of pockets is perfect. Highly recommend.",

I will buy this again, and my friend just got her on to use in the office, for files and organizing her daily assignments. And for schooling with heavy books great for everyday life duties.",
