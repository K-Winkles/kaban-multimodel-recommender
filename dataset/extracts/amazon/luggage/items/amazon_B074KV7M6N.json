                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. ORIGINAL REVIEW (March 2023)For those of you who want quick numbers, here they are:Purchased at $144.49 because of a coupon available on the listing. I ordered it on March 5th, 2023, and it was delivered March 16th, 2023. I got the \"Brown New\" color. Below are the actual height and weight, and the height and weight given on the listing's description.Large Checked Bag:30 3/4 \" & 9.7 lbs(Listing: 31\" & 10.2 lbs)Medium Checked Bag:26 5/8 \" & 8.1 lbs(Listing: 27\" & 8.1 lbs)Carry-On Bag:22 5/8 \" & 7.0 lbs(Listing: 23\" & 6.3 lbs)Next, here is my actual review.I took a chance on this as the reviews were conflicting. I rely heavily on reviews, so i make sure to leave detailed reviews when I can to help others like me. I have yet to investigate the warranty but I really hope it's not like the reviews say. The insert that came with the luggage does say it comes with a 2 year warranty and that you can contact them if you have any problems. Here are my first impressions. I will update after my voyage to my travel destination, and then again after I return from my trip.I needed my own luggage for my trip to Japan. I wanted a matching set so it's easier to locate and so it's easy to put into each other for storage purposes.For specs, the medium luggage is essentially as listed, the larger one is lighter than listed, and the carry-on is heavier than listed. In general, everything else is exactly as described. The locks are easy to change the combo for, and they can definitely be opened easily by TSA if nessesary, so they are definitely TSA approved. The fabric looks and feels nice. I tugged on the handles on the top and sides to test them, as some reviews said the handles broke easily. They passed my tug test. I also tested the zippers, by opening them fast, jiggling them, and pulling on them. They passed that test as well.The sides of the luggage have bumpers, which make it feel more durable. There are also bumpers on the side in case you lie your luggage on it's side. The carry-on does not have a handle on the side, but does have the side bumpers. I like how the front pocket opens out on the carry-on. All 3 bags have the same interior, with a large pocket on the inside wall. They also all have 2 front pockets, with the only difference being the carry-on has an additional zipper to reveal the open packing space, and the checked bags have a zipper to expand the luggage.The luggage has 3 different handle length settings. The spinner wheels move well and feel light and durable.I will update after I fill my luggage. These are my first impressions.UPDATE (April 2023)My luggage survived the transfer flights and long walking through the city towards my first hotel. I shipped the 2 larger suitcases to my homestay location through a luggage service and they only got a bit of scuff marks that easily wiped away. The wheels haven't scratched the wood floors and all of the handles and edges are still intact. I packed the 3 all inside of each other again and im storing some items in the smallest luggage all the way inside.I will add that the smallest carry-on bag does end up being front heavy and can topple over if not being held or if placed in a specific position. So far, that is the only issue I have.UPDATE (December 2023):Since my last update I have sent my luggage through a delivery service twice, back through the airport with 2 connecting flights, and use the suitcases to move into my campus apartment. They are still holding up just as well. The large one does have a small scratch on the front from being moved around a lot, but none of the fabric is fraying or falling apart, and the scratch isn't migrating anywhere. Still 5 stars! Really happy I got these as they're cheaper than what I was going to get originally and still super durable!",

                "reviewText": "Update: I've now used the set a couple of times and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for affordable luggage. It's not a premium set by any means, but it does the job well. I used the carry-on size on a southwest flight and it fit perfectly into the overhead bin. I was also able to fit a weeks worth of clothes in it so I wouldn't have to check a bag, and given that I'm plus size, that's quite an accomplishment. It seems to be a pro if having a thin liner.Original: My husband and I are going on a trip and both of our suitcases are broken. I must've spent 5 hours looking at luggage before I got mad and gave up. I got back to it a couple weeks later because we were running out of time. Again, I spent hours looking until I was frazzled by reviews, brand comparisons, sizes, and types. At the last minute, I settled on this set for three reasons. #1: The reviews were the least scary by comparison. #2: The price. This set is twenty bucks more than the other set I had narrowed it down to, but this set had the luggage lock so it felt worth it. #3: Shipping time. This was able to get here before our trip. They said it would take 5 days and arrive on a Friday. We leave on Sunday. I never thought it would make it when I saw it was shipping from the west coast since we're on the east coast, but it made it! We haven't used any of them yet so I will update the review after our trip and as time goes on, but from first impressions, they're good for the price. The lining is thin and basic, but it's exactly what the photos showed so that's not a surprise. The interior pocket is a basic mesh pouch. It's nothing fancy, but again, it's as expected. The sides seem sturdy for soft-side luggage, at least much sturdier than the Walmart Protege suitcase I bought that didn't last. They do store inside each other, although it's hard to get them back in there. You have to pay attention to the wheels because they get stuck on the side and it seems like it would be easy to break the zipper if you're not careful. It does roll really well. I even rolled it across some carpet and it was fine. The luggage locks do work. I don't love the built-in luggage tag, but it's there and it does work. It's really small though. I'm not sure it would be noticed if lost. So far I'm pleased. I ordered the black and orange combo. The orange is really peachy, but it stands out which was the point. We wanted something that might be noticeable at baggage claim and this seems to be that.",
