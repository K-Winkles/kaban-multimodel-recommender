                "reviewText": "I wanted a large case that can go on most flights. Those were my main requirements but aesthetics are a bonus and quality is definitely desired as the options are all $100 give or take. This case seems to meet the criteria for me and I got it for $89. The dimensions add up to 59 inches without the expandable part which would add 2 inches. According to Google flights will accept 62 inches in most cases so this case should work. The case is super light but seems reasonably sturdy. Feature\u2019s look good so far. The only question will be durability but hopefully with an established brand like this and normal wear this will hold up well. These things with the 4 wheels are a lifesaver in the airport. I used a large duffel bag before which was a bad idea because although I am in good shape the bag wears on you when you are walking the airport and carrying for hours potentially. Overall it appears solid. I will edit if anything changes when I use it.Edit post international trip: It was great for the first trip. Got it through American Airlines checked process no problem. Lightweight helps so that you can pack a few things. I usually pack shoes because I do outdoor activities. Love that you can close the zipper towards the top and I can put on my travel lock there so it\u2019s easy to access. Lots of space inside for your stuff. Wheels and handles and all held up for the trip. It picked up some scuffs as the grey color is pretty light but that\u2019s to be expected. For the price so far it\u2019s excellent value.",

The only thing to remember is it\u2019s big and does not really compact in any way for storage but that\u2019s sort of the trade off with hard luggage. All in all I am pleased with this bag and think it\u2019s a good value.",

This was a gift for my granddaughter for her summer travels and we are so disappointed in the quality.UPDATE. I used the warranty and the manufacturer sent me a new one! Hopefully it holds up better!",

I would like for the lining to not feel like a stiff parachute material but I think all suitcases have this now. All the other features like the zipper, rollers, handles are very sturdy and the hardshell outside hasn't been scratched. I bought it during a great sale and it arrived quickly.",
