                "reviewText": "I recently invested in the SwissGear Sion Softside Expandable Luggage in the stunning burgundy color, and it's been a game-changer for my travels. The 25-inch size is perfect for medium-length trips, offering ample space without being too cumbersome.What stands out is the luggage's durability. The fabric feels robust and has held up well against the rigors of travel. The expandable feature is a lifesaver, especially when I've needed that extra bit of space for souvenirs or additional items.The wheels glide smoothly, making navigating through busy airports a breeze. Another aspect I appreciate is the number of compartments and pockets, which helps in organizing my belongings effectively.I'm also a fan of the color \u2013 the burgundy is rich and easily stands out on the baggage carousel, making it quick to spot.Overall, the SwissGear Sion Softside Expandable Luggage strikes a great balance between style, functionality, and durability. It's a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable luggage for their travel needs.",

I went back to soft side after a two week trip to Europe using hard side bag with many hotels. Soft is much easier to open with less space taken up. I can fit packing cubes in easily. Doesn\u2019t seem as bulky as hard side to get around in airports etc. Can\u2019t wait to try it.",

                "reviewText": "After searching Amazon & Macy\u2019s apps for 2 weeks looking for a carry on for my son, I checked out countless hard side & soft side options & poured over reviews. I finally settled on this soft sided carry on. Amazon buyers had posted some useful videos & the reviews for this bag were consistently awesome. I wanted something with good quality spinner wheels & a telescoping handle that was sturdy. The bag needed to be affordable and have nice features inside & out. This carry on checked all of those boxes! Very impressed with the look & quality of this bag, both inside & out. Smooth zips with high quality zipper pulls, 2 handy & spacious exterior pockets for easy access to travel essentials (this is why I chose soft side over hard side!) a separate expansion zipper for more packing space for clothing, and I love that it has sturdy handles on three sides to easily grab this bag from any angle. One side has nice \u201cfeet\u201d if you want to set the bag down horizontally. The telescoping handle works smoothly and locks into place. There\u2019s two different height choices for this handle. One feature it has that nobody mentioned is that the zippers have little holes you can align and you can then use your own suitcase padlock on the bag if needed. The interior is spacious, nicely lined and there\u2019s an attached mesh zipper pocket on one of the long sides, and also a detachable zip bag they call a wet bag, so stuff your wet swimsuit inside if need be or use it for cosmetics or whatever. Not sure if it\u2019s TSA friendly because it\u2019s clear, but not exactly see through. The spinner wheels glide as smooth as silk across my wood floors here at home & it has excellent maneuverability. A nice dark blue, soft materiel. It\u2019s a great looking bag! I got a really outstanding deal on this when I checked out the list of these bags available at a lower price, shipped from the Amazon warehouse. I chose an option that stated it would be \u201cUsed, in like new condition\u201d that was listed $30 cheaper than new. It came in pristine packaging, no damage whatsoever to the box that held the suitcase and still taped up with \u201cSwiss Gear\u201d packaging tape. The suitcase & handles were still wrapped in plastic, tags were intact, and all of the pockets on the suitcase still were stuffed with the packaging tissue paper! This was an awesome score for under $100 and I\u2019m sure this thing will last a very long time! Look no further, this is the perfect carry on bag. I\u2019m sure Swiss Gear\u2019s matching larger size bags are just as awesome, too.",

The exterior was getting a little rough after 6+ years (light strains & fraying). The wheels held up great!The extending/retracting handle/rail is what finally kicked the bucket. I cannot travel with it via air, because it wont retract all the way anymore...So I tore it out and I use it on long trips that require multiple suitcases.",

So I tried the carry on but was comparing it to another more expensive brand. I really wanted to like this one because it has a bit more interior space. I like the large outside pocket, which I would use more than the two small ones a lot of styles have on the outside. But this suitcase is several pounds heavier and does not maneuver as nicely as an 8-wheel style. The handle feels loose/flimsy when extended and the button that retracts it sticks up higher than the rest of the handle so you can easily press it by accident. I ended up keeping the more expensive one once I got a taste for nicer quality, even though that one is a tad smaller inside. I will say this one has good reinforcement on the bottom corners too.",
