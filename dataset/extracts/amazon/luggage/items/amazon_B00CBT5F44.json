                "reviewText": "This is a great little suitcase! I was looking for something cheap that I wouldn't mind taking a beating during our 12 day trip to europe last year and this fit the bill. I loved the color. The blue is a very pretty turquoise- true to picture, and bright.Things I like about it: The wheels held up very well. They are large enough that maneuvering over sidewalks, pavement, and even cobblestones wasn't a problem. The swivel feature is SO helpful while walking long distances between hotels. It moves very easily without much effort.It fits a surprising amount! I was able to pack for 12 days with 4 pairs of shoes and a jacket with no problem. The expandable option was key. So many other hard suitcases I looked at did not have this feature.The two compartments are separated by a zip divider. I found this so useful for separating my dirty clothes and shoes from the clean items. I just didnt use it when I first packed and then moved things from one side to the other as I wore them.Bonus: it comes with a lock!Things that could be better:There is only one small zipper pocket on the inside that isn't large enough to hold more than maybe a toothbrush and some face wash. I had to use mesh bags or other travel bags instead. Not a huge deal but they tended to fall out the second I opened the suitcase. Even a loop or something I could have clipped them to would have helped.The suitcase held up very well on our trip and it only has minor signs of wear after being dragged through multiple countries, airports, and trains. I would definitely purchase it again!",

Issue if you have to 'expand' it to fit all your items you may not be able to carry it on board and put in the overhead due to it would be too wide. I loved the hard sides of it and it held up very well. Highly recommend.",

The inside has a nice zipper panel to keep it organized on each side. Each suitcase has a nice lock that is easy to use. The wheels move smoothly and easily. The handle pulls up easily. We have not used them yet, but I will update after we have traveled with them to see how they hold up.",

                "reviewText": "This suitcase was bought online for my grandson, it was his 8th birthday present. It was used once as carry on luggage. On the way from the airport to car pick up, the wheel fell off. Upon closer inspection I noticed the extent of the damage which included damage to the other wheel. I couldn't believe it, I was so angry. You can see from the photos how thin the case is, it's paper thin! I saw him sit on it while waiting in line but it should not have broken, he's only 8! Unfortunately when this occurred it was outside the return date, not only am I out of pocket but I now need to spend extra money on a 'better' product to replace this rubbish. My advice is save your money. I'm rating this one star only because delivery was fast, arriving within 2 days of purchase, but the luggage itself is a big fat zero!",
