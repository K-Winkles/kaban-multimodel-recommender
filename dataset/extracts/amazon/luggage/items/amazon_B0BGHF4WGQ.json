Sturdy wheels that stay balanced & never wobbled. Even when I added the extra weight of my purse on top, it stayed balanced. It's a tiny bit over the standard airline guidelines for size, BUT I had no problem at all getting it into either overhead compartment. I am very pleased with it. It does tend to lean forward if you have it fully loaded and sitting upright with the handle extended, but it didn't tip.",
