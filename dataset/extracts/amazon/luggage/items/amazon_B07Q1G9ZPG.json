                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Coolife Luggage Suitcase for a vacation and it exceeded all my expectations! This suitcase is not only stylish and durable, but it also comes with a plethora of features that make traveling a breeze. It's incredibly sturdy and can withstand even the roughest handling at airports. One of my favorite features of this suitcase is the TSA lock. It provides an added layer of security, giving me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are protected. Plus, it's super easy to set up and use. The spinner wheels are also a game-changer. They provide excellent mobility, allowing you to navigate tight spaces with ease. The interior is well-designed with multiple compartments and pockets, making it easy to stay organized while on the go. I especially appreciated the separate zippered section for shoes or dirty laundry - a small detail that goes a long way! I don't purchase luggage often and don't think many people do, so I am glad I did a bit of research and landed on this brand as I believe this will last quite some time for me to travel with.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived well packaged and on time. Upon unpacking, we checked all the zippers, handles and wheels; all is in perfect working order. My wife and I read a bunch of different reviews on luggage and decide on this Coolife set. We typically don't travel a lot but We are preparing for a long road trip and then my wife is flying to visit a friend. We think this luggage should meet our needs nicely.What we like, so far:The wheels work effortlessly; the cases just glide along, even when loaded.The handles seem sturdy, work nicely and are easily adjusted for height.The zippers all work smoothly; be sure to keep the two sides lined up well and they should last.The TSA approved locks work well and are easily set to the combination of our choice. We created a combination that is easy to remember!The design is unique and should be fairly easy to spot if we are checking our luggage for a flight.The three pieces store nested inside of the largest suitcase, which is nice; not necessarily novel but nice all the same.Possible negatives:1. They close with zippers and not latches. Zippers are great until they don't work, then what do you do?2. The \"locks\" just latch the zipper slider in place. Anybody with a knife could easily get into these suitcases.3. The color looked like a Bronze/Brown color on-line, but they really are more of a Brown-Taupe color. They do look a bit bronze in certain light, I guess. Don't be surprised if the luggage you chose is not quite the color you are expecting.4. The shell material is pretty light and flexible. It's definitely not the hard luggage of the 60's, 70' or 80's.All in all, for our purposes, this Coolife Luggage, model #YD000075, should work just fine.Update: After a 2,000 mile road trip and about 1,000 miles in the air, with the Large suitcase having been checked four times, this luggage works great and is holding up very well. The last photo shows one side of the large bag after going through baggage check at least 6 times. It picked up some minor scratches but still looks good and works like new.",
