                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars You can nest 21/24/28-inch together, but 28-inch must be expanded",
                "reviewText": "So I just got the 24-inch size, after previously getting a set of the 21-inch and 28-inch. With the size difference between the 21-inch carry-on model and the 28-inch checked baggage size, there is of course no problem with putting the smaller one inside the 28-inch.Unfortunately the 21-inch, like all carry-on luggage, really only holds enough for a couple of days by itself. So I wanted to get the 24-inch middle size. Anything larger than 21 inches will need to be checked, in case anyone is still not sure about that. Some airlines will even complain if your 21-inch case is expanded and can't fit easily in the provided metal frame baggage size tester you see at a lot of gates or check-in counters. So be careful about leaving the 21-inch size expanded when you're actually trying to use it as a carry-on.I was hesitant to order the 24-inch because I wasn't certain that it would successfully nest inside the 28-inch model. I could find no information on this in the answered questions or anywhere in online reviews of these exact \"Freeform\" luggage models. The dimensional difference between the 24 and 28-inch models isn't nearly as much as between the 21 and 28-inch models.This is potentially very important if you either A) live in a very small place to begin with, or B) wind up in a very cramped hotel room (or even just one with a really awkward layout) where they don't provide a decent spot to store both a 24-inch and a 28-inch luggage case separately without one of them really being in the way. Closets are typically just big enough to store one or the other size, but probably not both if you can't nest them first. Trying to stack them vertically will typically just use up all available space for hanging outerwear in an already tiny hotel closet.I took a chance and ordered it anyway, without knowing the answer. The news is mostly good. I found that the 21-inch fits easily within the 24-inch. So that was a very good start. But the 28-inch won't quite close with the 24-inch inside. Not nearly as easily as when I fit the 21-inch into the 24-inch. Seems like the 24-inch is a bit too thick. Luckily, all three models have an expansion zipper around the middle. Once the largest case is expanded, the main zipper will successfully close all the way around with the 24-inch inside.So, technically, you can nest all three together, 21/24/28, as a set. You just have to expand the 28-inch case first. The complete set of three cases will then take up a couple of inches more room than expected in the front-side to back-side dimension wherever you decide to store it. I don't think I would recommend trying to compress it to re-close the expansion zipper and then leave it that way in long term storage. Probably not a good idea.As for a review of the cases themselves, they have been pretty sturdy so far, and they are pretty lightweight without really feeling flimsy at all. The double wheels on each corner provide more stability and ability to roll over slightly rough surfaces like tiled walkways, moderate carpeting and asphalt, compared to spinner cases that only put a single inline-skate type wheel on each corner. I really dislike those. And of course they are all spinners, which is a far superior arrangement to tilt-and-roll types of luggage. You can actually put quite a large bag (like a ~30LB backpack) on top of any of these sizes and still roll the whole thing around on its four wheels without too much trouble. The larger sizes will be more stable, but even the 21-inch isn't too bad.Put two of these spinners back to back and it's not too difficult to hold the extended handles together with one hand and angle the two so that you can use your knee behind the larger one to get it going, and then push the smaller one along in front of the bigger one. Once they start moving it works out pretty well.The sides are plastic and tend to develop a lot of static when the humidity is low. So you may wind up with a lot of dust/hair all over them if you lay them down on a carpet before a thorough vacuuming. Rubbing the outside with a dryer sheet may help with this.Some colors seem to have a glossy finish. The navy blue and others have a sort of tiny diamond-shaped matte texture except in the grooves. They will all get scratched as soon as they go through even a single airport baggage system. It may be less obvious on the lighter colors. But the really light colors will show the black marks from luggage belts much more easily. Just remember that they are hard sided, so no outer pockets or fabric on front/back to get torn up easily like soft-sided luggage, and they have expansion zippers, which a lot of hard-sided luggage don't include. So just pick the color you like and try not to worry about it. And they do go on sale now and then. I was able to get the first set of 21/28 for under two hundred. I think they are kind of overpriced most of the time.",

                "reviewText": "I was planning a 4-week trip to Scotland and needed a case that fit the airline specs, but held as much as possible. I tried out a lot of different carry-ons and decided on this one. The things I looked at were packing volume, weight, handle sturdiness and operation, and extra features. I spent time testing how they maneuvered when packed with a heavy load and had a heavy backpack on top. (The weight can make a real difference.)Being expandable was a requirement. This is because you usually wear some of your bulkiest shoes and outerwear, etc., to create more room in the case. Then, once in country, it's possible to expand the luggage to pack those items when traveling town to town. You can also buy some things like toothpaste, hair spray, etc., to use while in country, and then discard before flying home. That can require the carry-on to expand, as well.The carry-on is fairly light weight and has good volume for packing as much as possible. It has a side handle, as well as a top handle. That really helps me lift it up to place on a rack. The placement of the zip divider panel was better than in some of the other bags. Some of the other carry-ons I evaluated had the zip panel sewn in pretty far down below the zipper edge of the case. This really reduced the depth that is available for packing on that side. This case did a better job with that.One thing that was really important to me was the maneuverability when the case was carrying a heavy load. This piece was the best. I can place a heavy backpack on top, and still whip around with ease on hard floors through the airport. I've taken it on trains and through train stations, as well. It's great.On the other reviews, I did note that people said this case showed scratches easily. Because I was going to a wet climate, I also ordered a clear plastic cover for the case. It worked in the rain, and also protected the case. It had to be checked on one occasion and was frequently loaded into the base of a bus. It still looks really good after 4 weeks of travel.One thing that Samsonite could improve on is the direction that the zippered panel opens when unzipped. You have to lay the panel over the other side of the case when it's open. It would be better if it opened to the outside so that the contents of the other side of the case was visible when the the panel is open.All and all, I am very happy with my choice. It worked well for a 4-week carry-on only trip. The color is beautiful, as well.",
