We always need to have a good set of luggage on hand for everything we need to bring and stuff that we bring home. When I saw this set pop up in my feed, I decided to give it a try since my current set of luggage has seen better days.This two piece set is awesome. The carryon fits in any overhead bin and is perfectly sized according to TSA regulations. The larger one is good for us to put all of our son's things that we need to take with him that we can just check the bag to meet us when we get there. They are both pretty room and we can fit a bunch of stuff into them if we pack strategically. Great product by an amazing brand!",

                "reviewText": "I got the AMERICAN TOURISTER Whim Softside Expandable Luggage, in Navy Blue, and the Large Spinner. It's the standard dimensions for any checked luggage, but lightweight, maneuvers effortlessly even with 50lbs. and has an awesome \"all-sizes\" handle instead of just one or two settings. This was super handy as I am short and my husband is tall so either of us can push the luggage at a comfortable handle position. The expansion zipper is pretty standard and inconspicuous, and I do like the toiletries bag that's included inside. Overall this is a solid large spinner form American Tourister and pretty much a no frills classic luggage.",

Being that this was for an international flight we didn't want to take a chance of breaking the rules. This bag was almost perfect. Why almost? There were only 2 color choices, neither being what we wanted.",
