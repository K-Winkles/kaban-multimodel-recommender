This will be tricky to try and explain, but I\u2019ll try\u2026As you can see in the photos, the expander is on the zipped side of the case, but it\u2019s outside the zipped portion. So it\u2019s supposed to expand the open side, but functionally, it doesn\u2019t work well if you\u2019re trying to jam as much as you can in (which is the point of an extender). They should have either put the expander on the open side or UNDER the zipper on the zipper side, like this other suitcase does. Hopefully that makes sense.On the PRO side, it glides like a dream, is lightweight, and seems durable. And cheaper than many other alternatives. I just wish they would have put that zipper somewhere else.",

We have been on a cruise for two weeks so this probably happened 3 weeks ago during our first flight using this luggage. VERY dissatisfied, and I don\u2019t see any way to contact the seller.Also, the inside cross straps are not stretchy, just hold things tight if you have a lot more stuff in there than I packed. So these straps are basically useless and on that side of the suitcase your items easily fall out if you open it wrong.I do not recommend.",
