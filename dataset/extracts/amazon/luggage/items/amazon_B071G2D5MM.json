                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great bag. But... Know your needs",
                "reviewText": "Note: I don't normally write 'day one / delivery day' reviews because they don't represent real world experience. I am going to make an exception because this is important. (Basic review towards the bottom)Know your needs.I bought this one because pricing on roller bags that also have the word 'laptop' in their name/ description command a high price regardless of how poor their quality is. So, why not get a rolling bag and just put your laptop in that?I already own a solid laptop sleeve for my laptop, which is only 13 inches wide. It adds another half inch to each side, so it is not some 17-inch behemoth.I bought this to replace a nice backpack I use in my daily commute that was aggravating my back issues. However, I pack a lot of things in it beyond my laptop. Including a soft side lunch box.And there is my conundrum. I did not think that part through. This bag is much smaller than you might think. It has several pockets for little things like a thin power bank, or maybe a tooth brush and paste. But when I transferred all my items from the backpack to it, it filled out quickly. Now it is so full that it is hard to zip closed. That is not a good thing for a 'daily driver'. So, I really need to rethink my needs.Know your needs.-----------------------Now, a basic review:Stitching: every seam looks to be stitched. There appears to be no glued up short cuts.Shell: ballistic nylon. It will fray if it gets cut or ground up on abrasive surfaces like curbs. That is just a natural fact of life.Wheels: inline skate style wheels on real bearings. They may lock up from debris someday but may last far longer that some of the higher priced bags with simple plastic wheels. There really isn't any form of curb protection around the wheels. So, for a commute bag, I must lift it over curbs to prevent rubbing and shell fraying over time.Retracting handle: it has its own zippered space and retracts fully.It has a locking design with a release button. If you are pushing down on it or twisting it while you push the button, it can feel like it is jammed, but it is not. The aluminum used in the handle does not feel thin or cheap. The bag also has nylon strap handles with a cloth wrap at the top, so no fake leather to crack over the years.Zippers: They have a pretty tight spacing with fine teeth. They look like they should last for quite a while. However, if you over stuff it every day, you may overstress the sewn seams holding them in. So, don't do that - on any bag.Pockets: All external pockets are pretty much designed to be used with flat things. The front pocket has a maximum internal space of about an inch zipped up. Side pockets are about the same but project a bit inwards into the main space of the bag for a little more room.Ground clearance: about half an inch or less. There are rounds pads on the front bottom which feel solid. No silly plastic legs to break off like many other brands.So, like a lot of other Amazon Basics products, it's a pretty good product at a reasonable price. Worth the cost when you need something but don't want to commit to an unexpectedly high price tag.Final thoughts: This is not a laptop bag. It is an overnight bag for your clothes and small items. It should fit in most under seat positions on a commercial airline plane. It will fit in an overhead bin.So, too small for my daily needs. That is my fault for not understanding my real needs. I won't be returning it. Why pay a restocking fee? There is nothing wrong with it. So, I'll keep it around for any overnight trips. My wife may use it more than I will for that need.If you know your real needs, then this is a great bag at a fair price.",

                "reviewText": "I researched and read reviews for dozens of small suitcases with wheels because I seem to take Frontier flights mostly and I just can\u2019t pay $65 a bag. I\u2019m taking frontier for a reason, after all!I was nervous, but I settled on this one. It was only $39 for the quilty blue one when I got it. Not the one I wanted out of all the pretty color choices, but the cheapest always wins.Matches my travel pillow so that\u2019s fun. Lol.I went across the country for 6 days.I was somehow able to fit 5 shirts, 4 leggings, a pair of flip flops, undies, and all my toiletries including a hair dryer, full brush and mini straightener.I\u2019m a size 1x and it still worked.How? I folded and rolled each piece of clothing.I had some stuff in the side pockets but not much.I wore the bulkiest clothing on the plane and put my sweatshirt around my waist. (Which I use for a blanket anyway because it gets cold on planes!)I hooked my travel pillow to the extending handle and I was off.I didn\u2019t use the inside zipper toiletry compartments. I tried but they bulked it out too much. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be convenient for hanging up in a bathroom once you get there but I\u2019m too lazy for that. I\u2019ll probably remove it for my next trip just to save a tiny bit more space.The zippers were sturdy and worked fine. The handle is good. The wheels are good. I guess it\u2019d be nice if they swiveled but I\u2019ll live.I like being able to put the handle down and use the carry handles when getting into my plane seat.Yes, the bag was stuffed so it was heavy. But nothing crazy.It fits great and easily under the seat in front of you, with room to spare.I really like this tiny bag. Perfectly what I needed for size restrictions and being able to pack all I needed.Getting around the airport And wheeling it down the plane isles is easy with this mini mini suitcase. It feels great to know I can\u2019t overpack and it\u2019s so compact and convenient.A great purchase. I want more for my family.UPDATE: I\u2019ve been LOVING this cute carry on. It\u2019s still going strong after probably 5 round trips so far. (Frontier and United so far)I just wanted to say that this does NOT fit under the isle seat on United. Just FYI.I rarely get isle seats but this did not fit. That seat area is smaller for some reason underneath. I had to put it up in the luggage compartment. No biggie but just letting you know.Not sure about other airlines isle seats but United didn\u2019t work. Their other seats worked great. Just not the isle.Enjoy!! I know I am!!",

Very nice bag though and was disappointed that I had to return. Oh, and was not a fan of the Amazon logo right in the front either.",

Great colour and pretty stitching. overall, looks great; good storage; wheels and handle appear solid. Not too heavy. Perfect size for a carry-on and for weekend getaways. Caveat: it still hasn\u2019t been tested in the field!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small wheeled carry on bag, as I'm fed up lugging a heavy bag around the airport, after checking in my main luggage. Especially useful in long walks to the gate for boarding!I've not used this bag for a flight yet but I'm very happy with what I've seen.Love a bag with pockets && this has LOTS!2 long, zipped pockets on either side, a removable mesh wash bag (though obviously could be used for anything) attached by velcro on the inside of zipped flap opening. There's another zipped pocket with pen pockets & zipped area at the front, great for passport, kindle, phone etc.Inside seems very roomy & as the flap unzips to fold back completely, it will be easy to pack with all the paraphernalia I seem to need on a flight.Not planning to use for short haul/weekend breaks atm but I believe it would be sufficient for a few days clothing & a pair of shoes/sandals. Even a packable down jacket would easily fit this great little piece of kit.The wheels & handle seem robust & I love the quilted design. I bought the black version & overall I'm very happy.",
