I had recently bought another \"top name\" brand suitcase set that I loved until I got this one, so I'm going to get rid of that set b/c I am now a convert to this brand / style and even ordered a 21\" size! The color is very pretty, too!",

                "reviewText": "This luggage was my first real set (also bought the matching smaller carry on size). Super cute and the color was beautiful. I originally bought this luggage for a trip to Maui and it held up pretty well. Scratches and scuffs were to be expected. Second time using it for a trip to New Zealand...not a great experience. Got to New Zealand, picked up my luggage from claims and it only had three wheels. Having to haul that thing around on three wheels, along with my other pieces of luggage... was a pain and not fun! I think we all can agree we buy luggage with wheels to make the transit much easier when traveling and the one biggest feature this luggage had was the wheels, \"four of them\" and it was an epic fail. The process from the airport to the hotel was a struggle, as well as, from the hotel back to the airport on the way home. Trying to keep that big luggage balanced rolling it and while carrying and rolling my other luggage was challenging. I was super bummed because this was a beautiful set. Now I'm in the market for another set but I will NOT buy this one again!!",

                "reviewText": "Haven\u2019t used yet, but I\u2019ll give an update later once I\u2019ve flown with it. So far, super impressed. I was worried that the actual product wouldn\u2019t match the photo or I wouldn\u2019t like something about the pattern when I received it, but it\u2019s even prettier than in the picture online! Lightweight, spins easily. Seems high quality and I love the separate compartments inside. Have gotten compliments on it just letting it sit in my living room for a week Haha - too cute to put away just yet ;-) Super happy with this purchase so far.UPDATE: I have traveled with this luggage twice and it held up beautifully!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE the look of this luggage and it is roomy and LIGHT and easy to carry, even though it is large. But the zipper worries me. It seems to be poor quality and it was hard to zip and looked ready to burst on my flight home. I have only used it once so the zipper may hold out. Can I buy a warranty now?Other than the fact that the zipper seems too weak for such a large suitcase and is somewhat difficult to zip and there is a concern that it may not hold up long-term, I am extremely pleased with this beautiful luggage.",
