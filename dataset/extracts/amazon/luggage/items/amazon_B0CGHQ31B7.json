It is light weight, the zippers work well, it is expandable, I like the 2 zippered halves - all important to me. The one critique I will give is that it is advertised as rose gold - this is not. It is more pink than rose gold. I am disappointed in this fact, yet I have decided to keep it.",

On our trip, we thought we would use the usb charging feature, but we've actually not had to charge from it at all yet. It would be nice if the wheels had a locking mechanism on a pair of the wheelsets, so that we aren't having to chase the suitcase on what we thought was a level flat surface. It is just the right size for a 3-night adventure trip! Love it.",
