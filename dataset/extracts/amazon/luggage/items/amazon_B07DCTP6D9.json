I\u2019d would confidently say you could easily get away with a weeks worth of clothing in this suitcase especially if you put your toiletries in your personal item.I love the zip compartments on this, being able to separate shoes from clothing is just king honestly. I know it\u2019s advertised to use the bungee side for clothes but I found that using the zipped side gives extra space to compress the clothing without harm.The wheels are super glidey and I moved around the airport with ease! The handle has two height settings which I loved but it is a tad wobbly on mine. Not sure if the are all like that but something to note.All in all the quality is fantastic, especially for the price. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I shop on Amazon ALL the time and don\u2019t write many reviews\u2026 but this luggage deserves it! And I am not getting any discount or free stuff. Just a normal mom who hates shopping, so Amazon is my go-to. I swear!!!Bought 4 of these for a recent trip - one for me, hubby, and 2 sons (9 and 10 yrs). Can\u2019t give this enough positive feedback. We carried on plane without any additional charge and neither airline batted an eye or even thought about checking size. We went to Chicago for fall break. Got there much earlier than our AirBNB was ready, so we wheeled ALL OVER our first day. Then on our last day there, we wheeled to several places and left at coat checks before trekking back around the city and to airport. Not a single issue! We easy wheeled them 5+ miles on this one trip. Holds TONS of stuff and easy to keep organized with the zipper closures on one side for loose/smaller items and pockets for shoes. When home, I put a couple inches of very hot water and some bleach in the bathtub and rolled them around for a minute to clean the wheels and wiped the outside with a Clorox wipe and they are good as like new. We have already gotten our money's worth. You won't be disappointed!!! So easy to pull or push, even for the boys. And very light weight - I have multiple back issues that are agonizing and this thing is lighter than my purse before packed.I\u2019d buy more today without hesitation! By the time we got to the AirBNB my husband was commenting on how great they were and well worth the money!!!! The variety of colors is great. All four of us had different colors, so no confusion about which belongs to who.",

She loves the colors, loves that it\u2019s easy to maneuver, and loves all the space inside!The only two problems I find with it (and reason for 4 stars) is that the handle seems a little flimsy, As other customers have mentioned in their comments. And the material inside with the zipper seems like it may not hold up as well as other luggage. Only time will tell.Would I recommend to friends, yes!",

I read some mildly negative reviews about the zippers, but I had no concerns. Maybe just pay attention and don't try to overstuff it. I checked it as well, and all I can say is it survived, no problems.Cons: the dimensions make it a tiny bit top heavy walking fast or on carpet. This is super nitpicky, but noticeable. I think if you were really rushing, you'd want to pull it behind you.Overall: after 1 trip, highly recommend!",
