                "reviewText": "Early impression 5 star rating. Price factors in as it greatly influenced my decision to buy it, and factors in to my recommendation of it. Duffels are not expensive, and this is priced right at sub $20. I bought the multi/pink dot for $17.I love it. I love that it came with tags, so it looks retail. The small brand name patch is subtle and looks good. I appreciate that the name sounds like a real name and not just a string of letters like some stuff have.The size is great! Spacious enough to pack plenty for a trip. I am a light packer, so I never need more than a backpack, but this squared off rectangular size with deep open center compartment is great for stuffing items. Then there are two good sized zippered side pockets (one on each end) that are very functional. Can be packed to the brim with assortment of stuff. The two smaller zippered side pockets on front are good for super small stuff, but not a lot of it. So think pack of gum, lip gloss, pack of tissues, smaller do-dads.Has handles, or can make use of optional, adjustable shoulder strap.FOR ME: I use this as my DAILY CARRY bag. Not exactly as a purse that I go into places with, but it is my bag that has things I may want/need through the day, as well as some emergency items. I like feeling prepared- so I have snacks, water, a small toiletry kit, first aid kit, and some other goodies. I usually have these items in a similarly sized large baggallini purse , but it always feels just a little awkward. Stuff gets packed on top of each other and it becomes cumbersome to access, with little extra room. But with this shape and style, I have more room to situate stuff, yet somehow it isnt really any bigger than the purse I was using. Things (I used smaller zippered bags- like toiletry sized) are side by rather than stacked on each other. Really good for the items I dont access much but want to make sure I have on hand. THEN there is still room on top for quick grab items- things I will most likely use that day. Maybe I tossed a book on top, or a long sleeved shirt, or some lunch, etc. Love my other brand of purse, but currently I am extra happy with using this Rockland duffle.The aspect that really made me love this is that I can use one of the side pockets to store my smaller baggallini crossbody purse (fits perfect in side pocket). I use that when I want to be totally hands free in a store. Then I can stick my phone, note pad, coupons or whatever in it. Or I use that smaller purse when I am visiting people. I want to have some stuff on me (tissues, lotion, lip balm, cough drops, pads, phone, etc) but dont want to bring in a big purse and set it down. I can keep it cross body. Yet, I dont always want this. Often I pop into a store with just my phone. So I want options. This duffle helps me have my options and keeps me organized.Basically goes like this: duffle stuffed with my basic needs and other stuff that makes me feel comfortable to leave the house and take off in my car or someone elses' car (ie emergency goodies). Small cross body purse stuffed into side pocket for quick grab as needed. I will then leave duffle in car and grab the smaller purse for errands, shopping, appts, visiting. Yet,if I want to carry this duffle as a purse, it isnt so big that it would look funny.Worth trying anyway.I havent had it long, so I will report back on its durability as I use it more.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gym bag when the handles on my other bag, which I got for free, finally broke.It's really the perfect size for hauling around your workout gear, and would also make a great overnight bag. I picked the camo color scheme because I like camo, and because the other patterns seemed designed for a 14 year old girl. The nylon is really tough and should hold up for many years, ditto for the zippers and stitching. The piping gives the bag some shape and rigidity while the two side pockets plus end compartments are great for organizing your small, easy to misplace items.This would be a five star review if not for the shoulder strap. The attachment points and D rings aren't as heavy duty as the rest of the bag and will probably be the first things to fail. One quick fix to this weak point and they would have a perfect bag. Aside from that, it's a real winner at this price point.",
