This version is slightly less maneuverable as it only has two static wheels vs 4 on swivels. The 2 wheel version keeps a little more room inside compared to the 4 wheel version, and the larger wheels travel over uneven surfaces better. Also I got the \"international\" version which is slightly smaller than the domestic version to insure fit in non-US airlines.All in all, good design with external usb port for charging and separate pocket for the a power bank (not USB C though), main compartment has lockable zippers. Extendable handle works well and feels solid. External pocket with clear TSA pouch for toiletries.",

                "reviewText": "I got this carry on because the main airport I frequent has carpet (which I hate) and that makes it difficult to push a four wheeled bag along (so, I\u2019m getting old \ud83d\ude02). The wheels on this bag are smooth and glide over the carpet - yay! I chose the 19\u201d so that if I\u2019m on one of those smaller commuter jets it will still fit in the overhead. It still has lots more room than my underseat carry on. I don\u2019t like having to check my bag at the gate because I then have to carry my 2nd bag to my connecting flight or baggage pick up. I really like the built-in charger for my phone while I\u2019m waiting at the airport. This is the bag that the flight crew uses, for a reason, and it might be a tad heavier than the regular one, but not much. It is built to last, and has so many great features; I think it\u2019s worth it.",
