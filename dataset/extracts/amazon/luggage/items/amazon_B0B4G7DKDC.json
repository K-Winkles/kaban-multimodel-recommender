                "reviewText": "We just returned from a trip which was the second time we used this piece of luggage. We found a spare part in the trunk of our car. We finally figured out it belonged to our Travelpro carry on. It is part of the handle. The part had a connector that was not installed on the inside of the luggage. Since the missing part was underneath the interior lining, there was no place for it to go if it had been installed in the first place. It was just made incorrectly. Unfortunately Amazon won't replace it because it has been too long and Travelpro won't replace it because it was not bought directly from them and they only guarantee for 100 days anyway. Luggage is something that might not be used often, so 100 days isn't much of a warranty. Bottom line; this was poorly made and we are stuck with a broken item that neither Amazon or Travelpro have any way (or apparent interest) in remedying. Sadly, I just can't recommend because it is poorly built and there is no way to have the problem made right.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: After spending a significant amount of time looking into warranty information on this set, I've discovered that this is NOT true Travelpro luggage.It's made by Travelpro, but it turns out it's a low quality set made for discount retailers. It's not even listed on their website and appears to have no warranty backing. I have had Travelpro for several years so, when the time came for a new set, I hopped on Amazon, found a set that I liked (and was happy to have scored a great deal) and purchased it (shame on me, I guess). I was completely unaware that Travelpro had watered down their product line and were pushing substandard items.It feels like a terrible bait and switch from a company that used to mean quality and durability. If you can, spend the extra money for the Platinum or Maxlite lines or switch brands completely, like I may be doing soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love Travelpro luggage and this is my second set from Amazon (I travel about 40% of the year) but this set is just really frustrating me.The carryon tips over with anything set on top. Neither case rolls particularly easily, but the carryon is a nightmare. The wheels seem to \"snag\" constantly and the whole thing tips over while I'm rolling it, even on flat hard surfaces.I'm trying to look into warranty options, hoping I got a lemon and it's not a flaw with all of this line. I've been shopping other brands recently due to the issues I'm having traveling with this set.",
