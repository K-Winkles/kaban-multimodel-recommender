Material used to encase appears it can take a lot of punishment and not tear or develop holes easily. And the bilirubin in combination lock is a plus. Great purchase.",

It has some neat compartments inside to stow things like shoes, toiletries, etc. Also has an expandable zipper to help cram more stuff inside. I would have given it 5 stars but the zipper is a little tough to open or close if the suitcase is full.",

It traveled through all the airports and busses with no major mishaps, tears, rips or damage.The only thing that became an issue was the pull-up handle ..... it seems to jam in one spot and becomes almost impossible to budge. It does work and does not appear to be damaged so unsure what would cause this jamming situation?I think I will get lots of use with this bag with my next adventures. I am a DELSEY luggage fan, this is my third case and give it a thumbs up.",
