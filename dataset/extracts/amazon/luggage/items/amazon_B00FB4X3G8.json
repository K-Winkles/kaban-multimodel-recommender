They reported to me that they were shocked at how much storage space each of the suit cases had. They took their large cases on a road trip and said they loved them.As of October 2023, they have also used them while flying. And anyone who knows how baggage is handled at the airports, know that you often find yourself nervous for the state of your luggage. Their luggage held up great and the contents inside barely shifted, even with the expected neglect that is sometimes wrought by the workers and machines.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this set of Rockland Melbourne Hardside Expandable Spinner Wheel Luggage in a beautiful Navy Blue for my teenage son. The 2-Piece Set came in the carry-on travel size of 20 inch and a larger 28 inch. They aren't as lightweight as they could be. They spin well and aren't glitchy in their movement. The handles could be a better design, but not a dealbreaker. The suitcase shell texture is nice, and we are hoping it helps in recognizing his bags on the baggage carousel. Got these for less than $140 which is a great price for a two-piece set of luggage. We will see how durable they are after a summer of travel by a teenager.",

                "reviewText": "I used the large one for a recent trip to visit family. I packed this bad boy full of christmas gifts. I didn't have any trouble with the suitcase, but the exterior has a little more give than I would like for a \"hard\" sided suitcase. I'm skeptical, but we shall see. I don't anticipate the big one getting used all that often, but the smaller will probably get used several times a year. We shall see! I like the color, the blue is nice and I was able to easily identify my new bag at the airport. Super lightweight when empty. The wheels work great, very smooth and easy to twirl around. The telescoping handle is rock solid, something I find many bags skimp on. Not this one!",

                "reviewText": "I am most disappointed in this set of suitcases. The side-carry handles are on the wrong half of the suitcase, they should be on the side that has the inside zipper closure so that when you go to close the suitcase everything doesn't fall out because it's only help in by thin straps. They were flimsy when trying to line the sides up to zip closed as well. Additionally, the handle used to roll the suitcase didn't lock on the smaller case and the wheels on either case were difficult to maintain a good steady roll when walking thru the airport. I bought these in October for my 1st trip abroad (in March) and had no reason to use them prior to this trip. Suppossedly it is too late to return them...but I think there should be exceptions. How does one know without using them, how they will work...only getting 1 painfully difficult use out of them does not seem rightl",

It held everything I needed and then some! The space is great and it feels really good quality for the price. I would recommend for first time fliers to get a bright color or something that stands out. Black is very common and hard to find at baggage claim, LOL. They roll really well and did the job. I love the different size options, and the smallest counts as a carry on with Delta! I love these and think they will last a really long time.",
