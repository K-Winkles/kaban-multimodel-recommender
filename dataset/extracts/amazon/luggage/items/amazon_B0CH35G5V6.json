I pick this color since the luggage will look really special, unique and eye-catching, which means it is super easy to recognize my luggage and won't be mistakenly taken by other people.Good looking luggage setThe hardside expandable luggage has a professional appearance.The shell appears solid and well-built by strong and flexable material.The four 360-defree spinner sheels provide super maneuverability, I can effortlessly move the luggage in any direction I want.3PCS-Pack, Expandable design luggage setThe set comes with 3 cases which are 20, 24 and 28 inches. All three luggages are with expandable design. I can load way more stuff in these cases compared to normal cases without expandable zipper. The 20 inch carry-on size is good for most airline regulations.TSA-approved combination lockAll three cases feature the TSA-approved combination lock, providing an extra security for me. With this feature, any airport security staff should be open it and perform inspection easily without demaging the lock.Light-weight materialThe Keytang luggages are really light in weight, making it extremely easy to lift with only one finger! I will be very comfortable bringing all three cases with my travel.Worth the moneyThese hardside expandable spinner luggage offers great value for its reasonable price and I do recommend them to anyone who would consider a lightweight and durable travel luggage.",

These are very high quality suitcases and have been beaten on many flights and cruises.I have tried many cheat suitcases set and most of them are coming with missing wheels and broken handel and bad zipper. These sets are the best value among all and seems likely last for long. Really love the TSA lock and the wheels are feeling very smooth even when it's full. The handles are also tough.Love the silver color. Great purchase.",

There is more than enough space to store your things for school, travel, and more. As you can see in the photos, it is the size of a normal backpack which is perfect because it isn\u2019t too big or too small. I also included a picture of the back of the backpack, in which you can see that there is a small zipper pocket on the bottom. This is very convenient to put money in or store your phone, or other things. The pencil case is quite spacious which is perfect to put school supplies or toiletries in. I would really recommend it for everyone that want a cheap but sturdy, big, and well-built backpack. I am quite happy that I bought this.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We got this luggage set 3pcs after our last set of luggage failed on the spinner wheels. Now I truly understand the spinner wheels are most important part of the luggage bag. Just want to be sure I am OK with the luggage sets before the Amazon returning window close. I tested the durability of the spinner wheels when I got the luggage by drop them full loaders. All spin wheels survived after multiple droppings.I am very impressed by the quality of the luggage bag. It is light, strong, with TSA locks and the shell is very strong. The material of the luggage is memorable, there is no cracking even you step on jumping.One of our last luggage set cracked on the shell. This set seems to have high quality material all around. I like the expandable design of this luggage set. You can load a lot more. You know sometimes, it really matters. The YKK zippers pull easily and smoothly, YKK is the NO.1 zipper, it\u2019s really stands for the highest quality . The TSA zipper lock is very easy to set and use. The numbers on this set are nice and clearly. The whole set nests well as advertised, black is my personal favorite color while my wife like yellow because it really stands out in the sea of black luggage bags when they are on carousel.",
