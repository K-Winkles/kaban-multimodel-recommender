Good wheels and easy to use and comfortable handle. The interior is spacious and I like the pockets and compartments. Excited to use it, then I will update this review.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If you're not all about the bells and whistles, then this might be it.I got the 3 piece Sky Max 2.0 CO/M/L set in blue after doing some searching and comparing different brands. Let me start by saying this is a great looking set of luggage the black accent fabric, zippers and shapes look awesome and you could get lost in the blue color. The interior of the cases has this peacock feather patterning that imo looks way better than some of the bland greys and checkerboarding of other cases. Here are the main takeaways that I wondered about when I was looking at this set:- Empty weight for 28\" is 8.4lbs, 24\" is 7.2lbs and carry-on is 5.7lbs- 108L capacity for 28\" case, 73L for 24\" case and 43L for the carry-on.- For the carry-on Delsey Paris gives internal dimensions of 19.5\"x14\"x9.75\" with 1\" of expansion. Without the spinners the external height is 20.5\" (Most airlines *should* allow it).- The 28\" and 24\" checked bags both have TSA locks for the main compartment. The carry-on has none.- The set only has a 3 year warranty.The wheels spin and swivel effortlessly and, at least when empty, roll on carpet with little resistance. The zippers are alright, solid and I like that they color differentiated the expansion zippers in red so you don't mix them up with the others. All bags each have two front pockets, a shallow one on top and a deeper one below. The carry-on has an additional small pocket on the right side which could fit small electronics. My only gripe is the handles, the stitching seems secure but it's uneven and the handles aren't straight or center (illustrated in my pictures). The telescoping handles are also a little gritty and wobbly. Not super concerning, but I've seen other reviews note broken handles and, from what I'm seeing on mine, I wouldn't want to abuse them too much.Overall, it's a good looking and solid feeling luggage set. It doesn't come with many bells and whistles like USB, included toiletries bag, suite compartment, or internal dividers, but what it does have seems well thought out and well built.",

                "reviewText": "I travel for a living, so I know how long to expect luggage to last. After my first trip with the Delsey Paris bag, it was already showing a lot of wear and tear. I didn't like it, but I was okay with that. It's a very large suitcase, which is nice, but it does allow to overpack if you're not careful. If you do get close to that 50 lb mark, it does become hard to maneuver. The handle at the top is just not strong enough. Again, that's an annoyance, but I could deal with it. But on my 2nd trip with this bag, the bolts loosened on one of the wheels and now it's just barely holding on. I managed to get it home, but it won't survive another trip. As mentioned, I travel alot and have had many suitcases over the years, and sadly, this one the worst. Just very cheaply made. I've gone through their website to see if I can get it repaired, but I'm afraid just shipping it to the closest repair center will cost more than the luggage is worth. My recommendation? Don't buy it.",

It has nice front zip pockets and a shallow one on the top corner. It seems sturdy. The retractable handle doesn't come up as high as I thought it would but the wheels work very well. I think this should do the trick for her as an overhead compartment bag.",

I actually found the set in a local store and bought it. After finding it on Amazon for $100 cheaper I returned the set and bought through Amazon. I'm happy to say the quality is identical. The set lasted through connecting flights and being thrown into the bottom of busses for travel. It took a beating and there is not a tear or fray in the fabric. The suitcases rolled easily and allowed for manipulation of multiple suitcases through the airports. I'm so impressed with this set that I plan to buy another. There are four of us in my family and we all do mission work annually in Guatemala. We needed a reliable set and this did not disappoint!",
