I joked with my friend that this bag was made of tissue paper so she had to be careful around it. It's not your mom's black fabric suitcase, so you have to be mindful where and how you place it, but beauty is everything in luggage & comes at a cost.I look forward to getting the matching pieces. I will not buy the checkable size because it won't survive but I'll def purchase the carry on sizes. No regrets.",

The size I got is a carry on so it hasn't endured much tossing and has handled multiple trips well. I'm sure there are better quality suitcases out there, but probably not as cute as this one. Overall it is dependable and cute! I got the butterfly design and it still came with the Betsey Johnson luggage tag which was not pictured in the image so that was a bonus!",
