                "reviewText": "I was in need of new luggage and I read a million reviews of different kinds of luggage before making a purchase. I needed a new TSA/airline approved carry on, as mine always toppled over, but I was finding that most that I was finding were saying \"carry on\" but weren't including the measurement of the wheels and handles so they were too big and I couldn't carry them on (which kinda defeats the point of a carry on, right?). I looked at this set for over a week before committing to them and I am so glad that I did. I spent $100 on a Sampsonite \"carry on\" that ended up being too big and I got this whole set for just a little more. Now I have a full set of luggage with multiple size options for different trips. I have only used the little one, but it held up very will in travel and it has very smooth rolling wheels. I seamlessly rolled it through the airport to get to all of my connecting flights. On the way home, I even had to check it (Id bought a bottle of wine) so I was able to expand it and check it and it held up very well and took whatever beating checked luggage goes through in airports like a champ! It only had a few scuffs on it when I got it back. I feel obligated to also note that the blue color itself is colorful and fun and easy to spot on the conveyor belt (most people have gray/blue/navy/dark luggage, and I LOVE the color of this set!At first, I wan't sure how I felt about the half and half packing, but I use packing cubes, and they worked perfectly, and I honestly may like it better, because I felt so much more organized on this trip. I am also very limited on storage space at home, as I rent an efficiency suite, so I love that they all fit into each other. It really minimizes the footprint. I highly recommend it this set!Seriously. the only thing I would change about this set is the zipper lock. They are not TSA approved, so you will need a separate TSA lock if you are flying. They are great for extra privacy on road trips though, so if you are not flying with these, that is a non issue.",

My only complaint is that when I looked at the closeup pictures, it shows the blue luggage with TSA locks. I ordered the blue luggage, but then discovered the TSA locks only come on the green set, so I had to purchase locks.",

                "reviewText": "Great product and great price. Shipping was fast and the customer service was great and very timely. I had a question about the product and they answered it immediately. I'm very happy with the suitcases. The suitcases are very light and very strong, perfect for travels these days. The locking mechanism was easy to set and is very secure. All three bags are very roomy and allow for expanding which is great. Already used the set on our trip abroad and the set held up quite well. The wheels are super smooth too. I highly recommend this set.",

                "reviewText": "Light Weight, great colors, smooth pushing or pulling motion. This is good for standard use. The lock is standard and works well, just make sure you read the instructions on how to set and reset before attempting to lock. If you lose instructions, you can find it on youtube. I like the compartments and sections that you will normally find in all standard luggage. The zippers are sturdy and big zipper handles that make it easy to access and slide across without getting caught. Nice set for good price and would recommend. Ironically I thought that this color would stand out. Laughing when another guy on the flight had same color bags.",
