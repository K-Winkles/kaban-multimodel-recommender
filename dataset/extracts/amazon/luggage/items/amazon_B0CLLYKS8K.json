I do like how it\u2019s divided inside and has all the dividers to keep things neat. Unfortunate though that it doesn\u2019t expand and doesn\u2019t have the front pocket that some hardshells do now",

This was one of my must haves for a carry on case, so may end up sending this back. A shame as it is a really nice case - seams/stitching covered; holds its shape when empty; nice sturdy wheels, top handle sits fairly flush, good space inside. The pull up handle doesnt slide as easily as I\u2019d like but seems fairly sturdy otherwise. Decription for the smaller siz needs to clearly indicate it does not have a side handle.",
