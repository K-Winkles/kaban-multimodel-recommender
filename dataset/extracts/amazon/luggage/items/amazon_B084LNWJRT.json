                "reviewText": "Update--These are awesome and lightweight for travel. I traveled internationally and they were perfect for the price.The only thing that I would add is that because they are single-wheel, they can get misaligned easier which may make your ride not so smooth at times. I also wish that the handles were sturdier. They are a little wobbly. I don't travel too too much so these work for me!---I haven't used them yet but these are very nice!They seem to be pretty lightweight but structured. I'm no expert but I looked at the shell ones and some of them said they were about 10 lbs as is so I wanted to shave off some of that weight. The wheels are 360 rotation, there are cloth handles on the top and sides, and there is an extendible handle on the top of both too. This is a great set if you are looking to have a bag checked then a carry on. The tall one comes to the top of my leg/hip bone (I'm 5'4\"). Wheels look to be like a hard rubber material which I like. They both expand about 1-1.5\" (I measured). The extendible handle on the smaller one is a little \"Wobbly\" when fully extended but I don't think it will be too much of a problem. Material is thick and looks like it will hold up pretty well. Packaging that it came in was good too.",

Thankfully, the wheels were okay as the one castor was close to the damaged area. In all honesty, I have to say that the cardboard box was not sturdy enough to support the suitcases. I want to order another set and am hoping the company will do something about the shipping box by then. There was also a mix up, as my neighbor next doors package was on my porch and these suitcases were on their porch. The review i gave was for the suitcases themselves, not all this other drama. We are happy with them!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these based on good reviews and they worked really well. The wheels are great and very maneuverable. The teal color makes them stand out when you are waiting at the carousel. The only thing I'd change is the weight distribution balance. If you are loading them very full and using the front pocket, they will fall foward if you don't set it just right and try to balance it or lean it on something. Still, well-made and great luggage for the price!",

                "reviewText": "I was thrilled with this bag upon receiving. Roomy, pretty, seemed sturdy.Took on a Italy trip, worked fine. Second use, barely at the airport to fly all the way to London and as going to my terminal, wheel breaks. I had to drag this full suitcase myself across two terminals at LAX (Uber driver dropped me off at wrong terminal.) So got a full workout in that day! Arm hurt for two days. Would not stand up straight while in line to check in and upon inspection, found out why. Wheel had busted. So technically broke one and half times into use. I had to buy one of those metal wheelie pull cart things to help me get around.Highly disappointed and wasted money on crap.",

Large one is roomy and expandable as is the mid size. The smallest makes a great weekender bag. She brought it for our weekend Christmas trip and it worked perfect.Smallest bag also perfect for overhead storage on plane.",
