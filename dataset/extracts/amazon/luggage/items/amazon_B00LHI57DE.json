They seem durable too, after my long trip at the airport I had to drive 6 hours to my destination and I had then tied to the roof rails, exposed to the elements and they only have some light scratches to show for that round trip.",

                "reviewText": "My MIL was coming to visit us from out of state - she was talking about putting her clothes into two pieces of luggage. (It is $30 to check each bag at most airlines nowadays). I suggested she put it in one large one - she said she could not carry a larger one - I immediately remembered that she had not flown in years and probably did not have the luggage with the 360 wheels - so I ordered this for her and sent it to her (over he objections). She loves it ... got all of her stuff in one - she really liked the fact that it was the hard cover luggage. She even had room to take back many Christmas gifts that she got - and it all fit! The lightweight design & 360 wheels made that large piece of luggage a piece of cake to manage!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good buy for occasional travel",
                "reviewText": "I bought this set of bags recently for a two week European vacation. We don't travel a lot, so I didn't want to make a significant investment in high quality luggage, but wanted something that would hold up reasonably well to occasional travel. These bags appeared to fit the bill based on price and user reviews.Overall the bags met our needs well. The smaller one was the right size for a carry-on, and neither of them suffered any damage throughout the trip. They were easy to wheel around or carry when necessary. There are only a few minor negative points that I'll mention:- As other reviewers have noted, the bags we received did have a distinct 'plastic-y' smell. I didn't find it to be overpowering, and leaving the bags open for a few days took care of most of it, but they did retain a lingering plastic smell throughout the trip. It wasn't a big deal to me, but others may be more sensitive to that. I think we probably could have done a bit more to eliminate the smell (I read that leaving them outside in the sun for a day or so may have helped) but as I said, it wasn't a big deal.- The handles feel a little bit flimsy. We didn't have any issues with them on our trip, but they just don't quite feel like they would stand up to heavy use.- The zipper locks that are included are a joke. I didn't buy the bags for the locks, so it's not an issue, but just know that you might as well toss them out. I figured I'd give one a try on the bag we checked, but when we arrived at our destination it wouldn't unlock. I suspect that I accidentally changed the combination while putting it on the bag, which seems pretty easy to do since to do so you just have to hold the shackle open and change the dials. Anyway, we asked someone in security at the airport for help, and he was able to remove the lock with just his leatherman pliers, which was good for us, but also goes to show how little security the lock offers.Aside from those minor gripes, the bags were pretty much just what we were looking for. I would recommend them to anyone looking for decent luggage to use for occasional travel.",
