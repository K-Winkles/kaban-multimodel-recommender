                "reviewText": "Purchased mainly for business trips mixed with some pleasure. Friends of ours have an older Swiss set of luggage that is durable, a nice look, with great storage. After much research, I went with my first hard shelled piece the 27\u201d and love it! The wheels are the best I\u2019ve ever had, smooth, tilt well when pulling behind, and strolls well nicely beside you. I love the dimensional look of this luggage, giving it a bit of a pop. The inside has ample storage and many pockets. The lock combination is easy to change and has held up well. After reading previous reviews on Swiss website and on here, I would say my only complaint so far, is the same as another, the handle on top could raise a bit higher if you are stacking luggage. I have the Swiss backpack and that does sit well on it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever buy a fabric again. I love the design, look, storage, and durability.",

                "reviewText": "Really good quality, as I expect from Swiss Gear. Zipper compartments are well thought out and I had plenty of room for warm clothes and my full size tempurpedic pillow I always take with me. I used a set of packing cubes too, just regular ones not vacuum bags. The only thing that was not clear about the charge cable; you need to use your own mini power supply. There\u2019s a clever internal pocket and a rubber sealed grommet to run the usb cable built in. I have a power pack about the size of my phone. It adds a few ounces and slips in the pocket they designed for this purpose. A good hard sided case - I\u2019d recommend! I\u2019d buy the bigger one too!",

                "reviewText": "I have both the carry-on version and the 24\" checked version. After a lifetime of mis-matched luggage it was time to have a nice set! I like that these have the 8 wheels instead of just the 4 for durability. I like the built in TSA lock. I also like the interior storage that comes built-in with these cases; which is helpful if you're moving from location to location frequently during a vacation. I expect that the carry-on version will last a very long time, but I'm not sure about the checked one. There is no grab handle for the base and the case itself isn't light. You won't want to overload the 24\"+ sizes or it's going to get damaged.My main complaint is that the case arrived filthy from sitting in a dirty warehouse. It also arrived slightly \"used\" from someone who chose to return it. People, if you are going to return an item, put it back the way you received it. Someone else is likely going to get your \"used\" item in the condition you returned it. Failure to do so means that the karma gods are going to make the wheels fall off you luggage from henceforth.",

I travel frequently 3-4 times a month.The telescoping handle broke at the grip. The warranty support was awesome took pictures. Weird I had to cut the tag out but I guess so much fraud happening.Got the replacement with a store credit within i few days. Fantastic support.Used the replacement 10 times the telescoping handle broke at the grip again. Needless to say I won\u2019t do three strikes.Please fix the telescoping handle and the curve of the grip so it holds up and grip doesn\u2019t dig into your hand as you push through the airport.Fix that and I\u2019ll try again. Most Swiss products outlive most of their usefulness. Not this one.Pic#1 bag #2 pic #2 bag #1",
