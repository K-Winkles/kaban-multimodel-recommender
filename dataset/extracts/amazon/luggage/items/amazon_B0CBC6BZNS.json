Spacious enough for clothes for 4 days as well as a fancy dress, 2 pairs of shoes, makeup and jewelry. Easy to steer, and fairly lightweight to get into overhead compartment. Pretty shade of blue makes it easily distinguishable from the mostly black suitcases. Very happy with this purchase!",

I\u2019m 6 \u2018 3\u201d and it\u2019s perfect height without having to reach down. Love the separate compartments. So far impressed with the purchase.",

I love how I\u2019m able to separate my delicate intimates using the zippered mesh from my heavier and bulkier items such as jeans and shoes. I also like the small zip pocket in the middle as it is perfect to hold my belt and jewelry box. The X belt/holder on the one side of the luggage keeps my jeans and shoe box or purses from moving all over the place, keeping them intact throughout my travels. Plus, this is expandable, which is also the same as my previous luggage, which is excellent either to hold souvenirs from my trips or to hold more stuff for a longer trip, eliminating the need of using a bigger, heavier, and bulkier luggage.As for the exterior portion of this luggage, it\u2019s very pretty in blue, which looks great on both men and women! It\u2019s also very durable and stable, with hard shell material and with solid wheels that spins very smoothly. It\u2019s very awesome and convenient to use for that long walk in the airport or cruise ports. It also features a lock which is very easy to use, to keep your belongings safe and secure at all times. The handle has good grip as well and easy to use.That said, I highly recommend this luggage to others as this is very functional and lightweight and, priced very-well. Thank you! \ud83d\udc9d",
