Be aware that the space of the main compartment will be smaller than the ordinary 20-inch suitcase when the front pocket is full. How to use the charging port outside the luggage? 1. Open the front pocket and get the cable inside. 2. Charge with a power bank. (The USB input only works for USB output, the USB-C input only works for USB-C output) 3. Open the outside port, connect it with a cable, and connect it to your phone. How do I set the code when I first get it? 1. Turn the dials to the correct combination. (The original code: 0-0-0) 2. Press down the button with a pen, set the new combination (e.g.: 8-8-8), then pull the square part. 3. Lock the case again, and now you can open the lock with the new code. What should I do if there is an issue with the luggage received? For any issues in product & servicing, LUGGEX claims to will keep the luggage in repair for 3 years. Please let us know via the Amazon email of your order and the related team will respond within 12H. Can both the front side and main compartment lock? Yes. The built-in TSA Lock works for both sides of zippers in order to secure your belongings.",

                "reviewText": "It's a nice carry on roller. I was able to pack: 4 light weight sweaters, undershirts, 2 pairs of jeans, under clothes, and 1 pair of ankle boots. I didn't extend the suitcase. But it was difficult to use the front pocket. The lock was easy and useful. The problems I had with this suitcase is 1. it doesn't stand out - looks just like everyone else's so you will need to put tape or tie on it. 2. Again, everyone else has one - so there wasn't enough room in the overhead and I ended up checking the bag. If it was a soft bag that fit underneath the seat - I wouldn't have had a problem.",

That\u2019s it.The inside looks small, but everything that fit in my old canvas roller bag fits nicely. The bag is effortless to roll and very light. The wheels, handles, and zippers are quality. When something does go wrong, the company is responsive and helpful. I highly recommend.",
