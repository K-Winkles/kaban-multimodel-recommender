                "reviewText": "These suitcases look pretty darn good. The color is unique making them easy to spot at the airport. The handles actually feel strong enough to carry even the big suitcase with 50lbs of stuff in it and the wheels are great.My only issue is that the shell feels a little flimsy, though it has held up perfectly for two flights and a road trip. It just wobbles a bit as you are opening and closing the big suitcase. For the occasional traveler (a couple times a year or so) I think this set will absolutely hold up for years and be what you need without shelling out several hundred dollars. For a frequent traveler I would not expect it to last more than a year or two.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these in June for an August trip (past the 30 day return window), they had decent reviews & seemed like a good price. Having issues with previous brands rolling really well in the store but then not when they are full, I immediately put some weight in them & rolled them around my house on various flooring types as to not be fooled again and they were great, I was very happy. I set out on my trip & was pleased with their maneuverability through the airport! Baggage claim proved successful & I was off to my cruisetour that included a short small flight a couple days in. Once I received my luggage in my room that evening I noticed a tear near one of the wheels & was disappointed that I would have to return once back.. Next stop was worse, no surprise, but by the next stop 2 more wheels were all but completely torn off & rendered unrollable! Had it not been for my cabin steward who found me a whole roll of packing tape which I incased the bag in for my trip home allowing me to drag it through the airport, I'm not sure what I would have done & certainly my unmentionables would have been strewn all over the tarmac & luggage claim area! One of the reasons I felt safe purchasing was the 5 yr warranty that came with the bag. What a joke! A warranty that doesn't cover \"damage by the common carrier\" & costs you a $40 handling fee for the company to provide a \"warranty evaluation\"??? I think we all know how that would play out! Luckily Amazon is the best! A customer service rep was able to waive the return fee & refund my purchase for all but the $28 that Rockland will charge them for a \"restocking fee\". It cost me $28 & a big headache on my trip but at least I didn't have to pay $40, ship the bag back only to have Rockland determine it was \"the common carrier's\" fault & give me nothing! if you look through the questions asked section, you will see lots of pictures that look just like mine....So it's not an uncommon problem. Buyer Beware if you actually plan on using these.....",
