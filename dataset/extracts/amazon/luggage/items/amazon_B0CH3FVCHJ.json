                "reviewText": "This is a well-made carry-on sized luggage suitcase. For my purposes, it would be easy to fit about a week's worth of needs in this case. Everything seems to be made of quality materials and I didn't find any defects in materials or manufacture.One half of the case is completely encased by material, held in place with a zipper. On the outside of this flap are two large zippered mesh pouches. On the other side, you have your typical suitcase tie-down system, with plenty of strap for large loads. There's a small, zippered pocket that looks like it would be good for wet items, but it's not very big. All the zippers worked, and the sewing looked good.The wheels and carry handles look pretty sturdy. The collapsible handle you use when towing it behind you as you walk wasn't as sturdy. I know lighter it \"better\" when it comes to air travel, but I would have liked to seen a little more sturdiness in this drag handle, as it's going to get a lot of abuse while in use. Once one of these tubes bend, it won't collapse back into the suitcase. That said, it did have a nice range of telescoping lengths that it locked in to.The lock is nice, though it wouldn't stop a determined thief (a box cutter to the zipper defeats most luggage locks). The combination was easy to change and easy to use.Would I buy it again or recommend this to friend: Yes",

                "reviewText": "I have a favorite carry-on weekend bag that's off-white and fits under a plane seat. It can hold 2- 3 days of clothing and accessories, but doesn't have wheels. So it gets heavy. This 20\" TOLINO roller bag was a great choice to take that weight for travel. My tote bag has a trolley sleeve to slide over the adjustable handle, and sits firmly on top. Now I have a carry-on set that handles with ease! The TOLINO luggage has an exterior bar, modern design, is noticeably lightweight, and rolls and spins 360\u00b0 with the slightest push or pull. The exterior zipper looks very durable and strongly sewn to the bag. A combination TSA lock is attached onto the side. Inside the roller bag has elastic straps to hold down your clothes, and a narrow zippered pouch on one side. The other side can be fully enclosed with a zippered material cover. This cover has 3 mesh pockets which also close with zippers. You can see all of these design factors in my posted photos. These items really help in organizing and maximizing your bag's space when packing. Lastly, this roller bag size is made to fit in the overhead bin on planes. So now I can carry-on the max with style!",

                "reviewText": "I like many of the features of this bag: the many different ways of configuring the inside, the light weight, the smooth handle, the compact size, and the fancy locking zippers, but there were a couple of things that bothered me. One was that, although they were cool, the zippers that actually lock into the combination lock are clumsy feeling to operate as zippers. There is also an inner lining that has the zippers sewn in backwards; the pulls are inside, underneath, so I basically had to break the zipper open to get at the pull.Still, the smooth rolling wheels, great options, sleek look, double handles, and the other features I mentioned overrode those small issues and earned this bag five stars from me.",

Super durable shell which amazes me because it\u2019s SO LIGHT WEIGHT.. I was finally able to get rid of my 2 wheel carry on piece. It wheeled through the airport effortlessly Completely amazed how much I was able to fit inside and totally appreciated the divider to separate clean clothes from dirty during my trip. Lots of separate zipper pockets to store chargers and other little stuff. Great organizing suitcase which I highly recommend. I didn\u2019t need to use the TSA lock since I didn\u2019t check the bag, but a nice added feature.",

                "reviewText": "I love all the spinner luggage pieces, how did we exist before? This one is white and very attractive. It rolls easily and is very lightweight. The handle works well and I love the built in combination lock. Especially during those rare occasions when my carryon gets gate checked, it\u2019s good to know it has a secure lock. This is a smaller carryon and the 2\u201d less than my 22\u201d\u201d does actually make a difference so it\u2019s better for your long weekends rather than a week long or more trip. I also miss having the outside pocket that opens up, like some of the hard case carryons have now. But it\u2019s still a lovely and well built piece of luggage",
