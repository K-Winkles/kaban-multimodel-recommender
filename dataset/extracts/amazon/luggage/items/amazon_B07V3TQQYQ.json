                "reviewText": "At 59 years of age, I finally purchased my very own full set of matching luggage, and what a great choice I made. Love everything about this set. Lightweight with a handle on the top, bottom and one side of each suitcase, making them so easy to maneuver. Wheeling through the airport was a breeze, and all held up beautifully during their first/only use thus far, on a flight from CA to PA. One of the flight attendants even commented on \u201cwhat a nice set of luggage\u201d I had. Preferring suitcases with one large compartment rather than two separate sides folding together, I was able to stuff so many belongings into these suitcases while still keeping them manageable at 35-40 lbs. The smallest bag, which easily piggybacks the carry-on, was used as my purse, providing loads more space than a typical purse. All four pieces nest inside one another, requiring much less storage space. What more can I say? Very happy customer! Highly recommend this great set of luggage!",

But the spinner wheels were not quite as smooth on this one. Once I got used to it, the wheels were fine. Love the fabric, the features, and the quality!",

I finally got to use this on a vacation - through 2 airports, on 2 planes, in and out of the car. It is great so far. It wheels easily and does not tip over. It is very light weight and seems to have more capacity as another suitcase I have with the same supposed dimensions. Hopefully it will serve me well on future trips.",
