                "reviewText": "When I had a small issue arise with my middle suitcase, I alerted the company directly over the Amazon Messaging system. In my first use with the 24\" suitcase ONLY, the internal zipper broke and was not repairable. My larger suitcase and my carryon, conversely, worked perfectly. When I made the company aware of the issue with the 24\" suitcase, I sent photos via Amazon Photos with the company directly (using the album sharing feature on Amazon Photos) for proof of the defective issue.Within days of seeing the photos, they confirmed that they sent what I thought would be the only item (the 24\" suitcase, since the other two worked exactly as expected) as a new replacement.When the item arrived, the box appeared bigger than just the 24\" inch middle sized suitcase. When I unwrapped it, I was surprised and delighted to find that they sent me an ENTIRE REPLACEMENT SET! Wow! I was amazed to see such an extra mile effort, as I only expected one suitcase as a replacement item.Merax definitely stood behind the promise of replacement and then some! I was thrilled to have more luggage without need of a return nor any return shipping. Nothing at all out of pocket and three new pieces to go with my remaining two suitcases!I gifted the defective item to Goodwill and was happy to write them about their amazing customer service moment. I would definitely highly recommend Merax Luggage to anyone. It is very refreshing to find a company with a brand promise like this when a customer raises an issue! Well done to the entire team at Merax.NOTE: I have since referred this company to others who have themselves also ordered their own set of three Merax luggage and none of their items had any defective zippers or issues whatsoever. Great team, great brand promise and great product line!",
