I sincerely hope the company does the right thing and replaces the defective suitcase. Will report back after I hear from the company.Update: the company has not gotten back to me in response to my complaint about a rip in the fabric before we even used the luggage. Now we've used the medium one on a 3 week trip. The luggage did not perform well in Europe. The wheels are ok at best and the bag itself is pretty worn, especially in comparison to the other higher quality piece of luggage we used. I wouldn't buy again",
