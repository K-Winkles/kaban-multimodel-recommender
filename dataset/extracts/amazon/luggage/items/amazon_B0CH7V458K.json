When we traveled back home I was able to fit all five of our clothes into the largest suitcase and the smallest suitcase we were tied on space in the car. Otherwise I would have just used all three of them, the largest suitcase is especially big and does take up quite a bit of room but you are able to fit so much inside them that it makes it worth it. Each one of the suitcases comes with a divider that you can zip up to keep items separate from each side of the suitcase . They roll very well. They have handles on two different size of the suitcase to make it easier to grab and to carry the handle, does push all the way down to keep it out of the way they are quite durable, but I did notice the outer casing was not as hard as some of my other hard case suitcases had been in the past, but they were still hard enough to where I didn\u2019t have to worry about them, squishing in and ruining anything that might be inside of them. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent budget suitcase set",
                "reviewText": "This is a complete set of 3 suitcases that cover all the likely sizes you'd need.The large suitcase fits into the standard maximum size for airline checked baggage. The small suitcase is the standard \"rollaboard\" size for the overhead compartment. And, the one in the middle is too large to carry on, but is easier to schlep around for checkin.All three are an attractive and unusual lavender color, making them stand out at baggage claim. They are made of what appears to be slightly better-than-average semi-flexible plastic - it seems to be thicker and stronger than cheap luggage I've had, while perhaps not being quite as stout as the expensive name-brand stuff.The only feature I really miss is, these suitcases don't have the expandable-zipper section in the middle that allows them to be made a few inches thicker, for if you picked up just a few too many souvenirs to bring home and can't quite make everything fit. I can't complain. But that wasn't offered or claimed, so at this price, I have nothing to complain about - it's an excellent bargain! There's also a handy little freebie included - a drawstring laundry bag.Each suitcase includes a zippered closure over one half, and an elastic clipping bungee arrangement over the other half, to keep your belongings from falling out when you open the suitcase. All the zippers seem to be of at least mid-grade quality, perhaps a bit better. The wheels appear to be reasonable sturdy - better than the cheapo ones anyway.While it is certainly possible to find stronger and longer-lasting suitcases if you're willing to pay a hefty premium, I doubt you will easily find a complete set that is as good quality as these.

                "reviewText": "I own some expensive and sturdy luggage bags but one of the problems I have with them is how heavy they are. This is a problem if I go air traveling where there's a limit on the checked-in luggage.This \"Tripcomp Luggage Sets 3 Piece\" solves my problem. The 2 of the larger cases (24 and 28) have good size while still lightweight, which is perfect to be checked in. The 20-inch one is the perfect size for carry-on.It is also amazing to see all 3-pieces come at a very reasonable price together, which makes this product a great value. Recommended!I hope you find this review helpful and I appreciate that.",

                "reviewText": "I was happy that this luggage set arrived the day before I flew to Florida for a cruise. I packed all 3 pieces with my belongings and was pleased to finally have an attractive set of matching luggage.However, my excitement with my new luggage was short-lived. When I picked up the luggage at the end of the flight, a wheel was entirely ripped off the largest bag. It was not over-packed, and weighed only 39 total pounds at the airline luggage counter. After I arrived at my pre-cruise hotel, I walked to a nearby store to buy a roll of duct tape, with which I patched up the hole where the wheel previously was.The next day I boarded the cruise. Luggage goes through conveyor belts on the cruise ship, much like a typical airport. When my luggage arrived in my cruise ship cabin a couple of hours later, I was dismayed to see that the medium sized suitcase had a foot-long crack in it. Again, the bag was not over-packed at all, and had weighed in at only 32 total pounds at the airline luggage counter.At the end of the cruise, I again used the roll of duct tape to patch up the two largest pieces of my brand new luggage. By the time I flew back home, the large suitcase had lost another wheel and had developed a crack on the back. The medium suitcase managed to keep all of its wheels, but the original foot-long crack expanded across the suitcase. The small carry-on piece still looks perfect, but it never went through checked luggage at any point. I kept it with me and put it in the overhead bin of the airplane.My spouse threw the two largest suitcases into the trash the day after we arrived home. I wish I had thought to take photos of the damage before the garbage truck took it away, but my judgement was clouded by anger. I cannot recommend this luggage at all, unless you only plan to travel by car and treat it like a fragile item. I rate it 1 star, and only because 0 isn't an option.",

                "reviewText": "These roll very well and seem quite sturdy. They don\u2019t come with the little zip lock code thing, which I have seen come on a lot of cheaper suitcases now (so moderately disappointing). I do like that it is a whole set and they are large. Unfortunately, they do not expand. There\u2019s not a secondary zipper to make them wider, which is almost standard in all suitcases, so I subtract 1 star for that.",
