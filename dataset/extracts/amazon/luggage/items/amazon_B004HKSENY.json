                "reviewText": "An amazing piece of luggage for an amazing price! I purchased the black, as it was the lowest priced of the 20 inch model. It is a sleek looking piece much more like an expensive piece of luggage. I've already used it on a trip to Boston, so I can say without a doubt that it handles beautifully! The handles allow you to easily put it in and out of the trunk of the car, and the wheels maneuver easily in all directions and over all terrains: bumpy concrete, smooth tile and carpet. By accident I dropped the luggage while loading it (my fault completely) and it escaped unharmed. The body has a very fine texture print so small dings don't seem to appear.The joke at my house is that this small piece of luggage is like a clown car! When I was sharing how much I packed, people couldn't believe how much I kept pulling out of the bag. Typically I need to sit on my luggage to even begin to get near to closing it, but I found that I had room to spare with this piece. It seems to me that the construction is so deep and rectangular that no room is sacrificed for trying to create a slimmer profile. As I've already pointed out, however, this is so well made that in my opinion it is much nicer looking that other models I've had, and it certainly holds a good deal more due to the depth of each side of the luggage.The handle extends easily and retracts easily as well. The zippers work smoothly with the luggage opening complete for easy packing. The interior is separated by a zippered separator, ensuring that your clothes remain in place while traveling and upon opening the luggage. There is a small zippered interior pouch, which I didn't use but you may want to use for small items.In summary, I couldn't be happier. The price point, the looks and the overall ease of use of this piece of luggage made it a great find for me.",

The only thing I don't know is how well it will hold up in the long run. Newer bags such as then appear to be hard-sided, but in reality they have a (seemingly) flimsy outer shell. Most bags nowadays seem to be this way. But, I was impressed at how smoothly it rolled on both hard floors and on thinner carpet.",

Nice zippered and separated sections to keep things organized and place dirty clothes and shoes in for the trip home.",
