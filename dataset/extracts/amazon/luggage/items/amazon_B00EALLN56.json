Often times I drive when I travel and to be fair I have not taken this suitcase through an airport YET, however I will and update my review accordingly.This suitcase packs a lot of items for being so lightweight and unassuming. I am able to put everything I need into this suitcase and still have room for more! Although I am an experienced packer, I still pack a lot, including my heavy steel toed boots. This suitcase is also very durable and sleek. I like that the wheels glide over many different surfaces with ease, and is not likely to tip over due to how sturdy it is! I find that there are a lot of different types of Samsonite luggage, and I found that this particular line got a lot of marks for durability. I also appreciate the affordability for my price range. I do believe you get what you pay for and I know that luggage can get destroyed by airlines, so I wanted to opt for a nicely made suitcase as opposed to one that strictly based on the cost. I find that the suitcase is well made and durable.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: Lightweight yet spacious suitcase, durable and glides smoothly on various surfaces. \ud83e\uddf3\u2708\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4dI'm thoroughly impressed with this suitcase's capacity. Despite its lightweight and unassuming appearance, it's a packing powerhouse. I'm quite the experienced packer and tend to bring a lot, including my hefty steel-toed boots, yet this suitcase accommodates it all with room to spare.Its durability is another standout feature. The sleek design belies its ruggedness, perfectly balancing style and sturdiness. The wheels are a dream, effortlessly gliding over a range of surfaces and the suitcase's stability means it rarely, if ever, tips over.When it comes to luggage, Samsonite offers a wide range, but this particular line scores high in durability, which is a key factor for me. Plus, it fits comfortably within my budget. I'm a firm believer in the principle of 'you get what you pay for', especially knowing how rough airlines can be on luggage. Opting for a well-constructed suitcase rather than just the cheapest option was important to me.Overall, this suitcase strikes the perfect balance between quality construction and functional design, making it a reliable travel companion.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough good things about this line from Samsonite! Since purchasing them a year ago to replace my older luggage I've taken them all over Brazil, all over Argentina, Singapore a dozen times, Bangkok at least once a month for the last 2 years, Ho Chi Min, all over Cambodia, and of course on trips around the US.I've thrown them on and off buses, dragged them from train to train, crammed them in and out of more taxis and shuttles than I can count, and dragged them about a mile and a half down the road in the rain (they're surprisingly water resistant at the seams and expansion fabric...although certainly not water proof).Through it all the handles have held up, despite the larger two consistently weighing in at 70 lbs and the carry-on frequently tipping the scale at close to 40 lbs (don't tell the airlines...that's way too heavy for a carry-on to be) and the wheels are still in amazing shape.The bags also look fantastic given them beating they get! There are a few scratches here and there and I've frequently gotten a bag back with a corner smashed in...but it always pops right back into place with no issues, and the contents are always safe and secure.The locks are still in perfect working order...the handles still slide in and out easily and feel solid when locked into place. All of the zippers work perfectly.The single significant gripe I have about this set of bags that would make it absolutely perfect would be more handles.The carry-on only has a handle on the top of the bag...which makes it a bit awkward for carrying up and down stairs...a side handle like the other two have would be ideal.It would also be nice if there was a grip of some sort on the bottom so that you could more easily lift with two hands when moving it up onto a rack or something of that nature...while most purchasers won't use them to the degree that I do, most will at some point want to put this bag onto a stand in the hotel or lift one up onto a shelf in the terminal bus...the largest bag in particular has a deceptive amount of storage space (I've had it loaded to 104 lbs) and picking it up by the top handle and a rotating wheel is...not super fun.That one caveat though shouldn't discourage anyone from buying them...they've stood as well and better to any number of other more expensive bags I've owned, including other Samsonites...I've been very pleased with them, and expect them to last at least another few years at my current travel pace. For people like my parents who only fly a few times a year this bag could very well be the last one you ever have to buy.EDIT 02/17/2017:I've now purchased 3 full sets of this luggage, 2 in Charcoal for me and a purple set for my girlfriend. I can literally pack everything we own save our camping gear and bikes in those 9 bags...to date the only issue I've ever had was that someone tried to get into one of them and tore through the zipper with a screwdriver or knife...the end result was one zipper clasp was completely missing and a few teeth on the zipper got bent up pretty badly. I sent it off to one of their authorized dealers in Singapore though and was able to repair it with no issues while I was in Malaysia for a few months.EDIT 01/11/2018:After 2 years and just shy of 100 flights, I ripped the seam of the inside liner on one medium bag. I don't think this was the result of bad workmanship however, rather I'd only packed clothes and some camera gear into the top section and zipped it off. The other side was not entirely empty but close. I think at some point the pressure of the gear against the fabric divider, without the support of gear on the opposite side allowed enough motion to cause the seam to give out. It's being repaired now...I'll add a picture once I get it back.",
