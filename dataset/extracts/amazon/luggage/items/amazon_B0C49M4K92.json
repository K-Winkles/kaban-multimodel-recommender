                "reviewText": "I bought this for plane trips where the airlines are fussy with the size and weight of the carry-on. This was the correct 20\" size and very light weight. Carried a lot of stuff. There is an expendable option but I didn't use that. It comes with a handy small bag that can carry essentials and fits under the seat. My only observation is that the zippers are flimsy - might break with more use. Also, the pockets and the small bag had only one zipper, there should be two zippers to make opening easier. And if one breaks, the bag would still be usable with the other one.",

I'm always unsure about my little bag I can take to my seat because I want my purse, but my purse doesn't fit everything. The little bag in this set is the perfect size to fit both my purse and some snacks and other necessities. The larger piece fit in all my clothes AND shoes and was still light enough to swing up into the luggage bin myself. The lock was easy to figure out. And it also looks really nice with the black and gold zips! Together they were just the perfect traveling companions and made getting through an airport again less stressful.",
