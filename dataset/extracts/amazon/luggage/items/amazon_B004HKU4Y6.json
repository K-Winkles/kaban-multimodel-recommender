                "reviewText": "I bought this because I was flying from Ohio to the Alaska peninsula for work, would be in Alaska for 40-45 days, and I didn\u2019t want to check any luggage. I flew on Delta, and Alaska Airlines.This carry-on was large enough to hold: 13 pair of underwear, 13 pair of socks, 6 bras, 6 pair of blue jeans, 4 tee shirts, 3 long sleeve shirts, a pair of sneakers, a hooded zip up fleece safety jacket, and odds and ends of things I could stuff in the cracks. Seems unbelivable, but as my sister remarked, I\u2019m a packing ninja.Once I boarded the plane I was able to fit it into the overhead bin without problem, perfectly. As a warning for those considering expanding it for that extra room: DON\u2019T! Unless you want to go through and take stuff out when it won\u2019t fit. This carry-on fit through the bin opening with no extra room to spare.I had a layover in Chicago, and walked to a different terminal, which seemed like a million miles away. The wheels worked perfectly, the handle was sturdy, and when I stopped to wait at my gate I was able to set my back pack on top of it without any trouble.The outer shell is rugged, the zippers performed as would expect a zipper to perform. While I didn\u2019t expand the sides for additional room, I played with it to see if it worked right, and it did.While I\u2019m not excessively rough with my belongings, I expect a product to stand up to everyday wear and tear, and I don\u2019t baby things. This carry-on did not disappoint. During the trip and afterwards, it has been banged around, dropped repeatedly while full and empty, slid on its front across a concrete parking lot, and yes it shows some wear but not as much as you would expect after heavy use.As a reminder, don\u2019t mess with the included lock until you have read the directions on how to operate it.All in all, this carry-on exceeded my expectations.",

For the price it\u2019s a really great suitcase, the handle and wheels do seem a little fragile but I haven\u2019t taken on my trip yet so can\u2019t say too much on that. Very chic!",

                "reviewText": "I checked at a suitcase shop and similar items are three times more expensive than this carry-on gem I have bought. It has two compartments separated by a piece of zipped fabric. This is very practical because I can keep my clothes in a clean and dust free environment zipped away from other belongings that may not be so perfectly clean, like shoes and handbags. The orange colour is perfect. Since my son's black suitcase was sent to another airport and it took the airline three weeks to find and bring it back, the best advice we got was to avoid black suitcases. This colour can be spotted and seen perfectly easily from a distance.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this last minute for a trip to Europe when I realized that I was going to need to fit everything in a carryon rather than a larger checked bag as I planning due to a tight layover. I wanted something that was expandable for things I picked up along the way which my current carryon lacked. I was hesitant to buy because of some of the reviews regarding the wheels and durability, but I figured if it at least made it through the trip it was worth the cost. This bag greatly exceeded all my expectations! The bag and wheels held up great through 6 flights including being checked 3 times and across many different terrains including cobblestone, gravel and a wooden pier. There was a slight dent in the corner that I was able to pop back out after my final flight but I blame that more on the people handling the checked baggage. It also fit no problem in all overhead bins including on some budget airlines. The orange color made it easily identifiable. The bag kept it shape and was easy to zipper even when packed to the absolute gills.",

                "reviewText": "Like the title says I took this as an over head carry on with no problems. I flew delta and was not stopped once ( I did book comfort+ and was flying dtw>lhr) so I don't know if you'll have issues in main or economy seating. Wheels worked great and smoothly in airports as well as an unexpected walk on rural sidewalks with gravel and through grass even rain! The case of the suitcase does flex and bend so if you want something stiff and sturdy you may want to look for another suitcase. But overall the bag handled all the wear and tear you normally would face during travel. Very happy.",
