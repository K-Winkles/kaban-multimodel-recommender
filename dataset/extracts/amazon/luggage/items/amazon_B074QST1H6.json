                "reviewText": "Suitcase arrived quickly and I used it once as a carry on of course. It's Polycarbonate/ABS mix which is essentially a top of the line material mixed with less durable material. That's odd! This luggage will scratch and take some hits, but so will most in the price range. No big deal. Secondly, I measured 21 x 13 x 10 without the extension feature. The color is great, the wheels feels like it's gliding, the inside compartments are pretty standard for hardside luggage but probably the best part. The handle appears flimsy but works fine, but I would avoid lifting the bag using the extendable handle, which I tend to do. I think if you're mindful of not throwing it around, it should last 2-3 years, based on frequency of travel. So far so good!",

The inside zippers are very fragile and the separators for the different compartments are made of very lightweight material.
