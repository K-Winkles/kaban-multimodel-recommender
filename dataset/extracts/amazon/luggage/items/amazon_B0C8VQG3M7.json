Fits under seat perfectly,. Just perfect for what I need. I don't have to ask someone else on plane for help. My backpack is now officially retired.",

Ordered the paisley last year, haven't used, decided to try the flowered one because posted description and tag description stated same measurement's, except flowered one was suppose to be 3\" deeper. WRONG! Actual size for flowered bag is 15x13x8, considerably smaller! Regarding weight complaints . . . they have wheels, for rolling! You shouldn't need to pick up much, and I think heavier/higher grade materials may account for weight.",

I\u2019m a senior lady and had trouble getting it attached to the handle of my suit case.I\u2019m thinking of leaving it in the hotel and buying something else for my return trip home. Something that I can manage better.It might be okay for a young strong person. It is pretty.",

                "reviewText": "I do a lot of one or two night trips for work and this bag is perfect. What I love the most is that it doesn\u2019t scream suitcase so when I do a one day trip and have to bring it with me to my meetings, it just looks like a roller business bag. The separate pocket for my laptop in work stuff makes it so nice that I\u2019m not opening up my suitcase and showing my clothes to the people I meeting with.I never have put it under the seat so I don\u2019t know for sure if it fits under the seat I use it more as the luggage in the overhead compartment, but it isn\u2019t large. It easily holds clothes and hair stuff and make up for two days.",

The carry handles are a bit long and get caught in the wheels. I have to tuck the handle in when wheeling the bag.",
