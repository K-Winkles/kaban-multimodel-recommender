                "reviewText": "When I received this suitcase I was worried about the outer zipper ripping during our flights but I was wrong. We had several flight transfers on our way to and from our vacation destination. The outer zipper held together just fine. It is very flexible and I thought it would bust. The part that did get a tear in it after only unzipping it a few times (with items packed in the zipper part) was the inner zippered compartment. It held up but I don't think I can use it too many more times without it ripping apart completely. The zipper part was not even stuffed all the way full but somehow it ripped. The shell of the suitcase seems like it is flimsy but it is not. It has a few scratches on it from the bag handlers but that is to be expected and is no fault of the manufacturer. I got the blue one and it made it really easy to spot my bag in baggage claim. The handle is nice and the maneuverability of the luggage is smooth and easy rolling. Made it really easy to tote around the airports. The suitcase is lightweight and the wheels are of high quality. I just wish the inner zippered liner was more well made. It is a pretty nice suitcase for the price you pay. Just be careful with that zippered part inside. There is plenty of room inside for all your stuff. It is not a carry on and must be checked. I packed for a 13 day, multiple city (with different climates) vacation in this suitcase. I tend to overpack wherever I go but did not this trip. I could have though. Plenty of space for lots of stuff.",

I was wrestling between expensive luggage or cheap luggage and decided to go cheap and see how long it lasts. So far this luggage has survived two trips without a hitch.My only suggestions to improve about it are:-they don't come with a removable laundry bag that is pretty commonplace in luggage these days-the handle sometimes doesn't lock into place firmly and will drop down while rolling the suitcase in front of you (this is without putting a lot of weight on it)The lime green is bright, but that makes it nice for spotting my luggage after my flight. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",

This is luggage is huge. Even though it's huge it is not very heavy. It weighs a little more then a cloth piece of luggage of the same size. The wheels are really smooth on this and it's easy to pull/push. Even when fully loaded there is no difference in the smoothness of the wheels. The interior has several pockets to separate different articles of clothing. The overall construction is top notch and has handled the baggage handlers without any damage.",
