                "reviewText": "For all the important features - these are great suitcases. Security - CHECK. Sturdy - CHECK. Rolling - CHECK. Roomy - CHECK.We bought two of these suitcases, one in red and one in blue. They don't just roll - they omni-directional gliiiiiiiide. As in smooth as silk and effortless movement, even if they are stuffed to the gills. I have problems with sciatica and back pain, and there was no problem whatsoever with moving one of these S'Cure Spinners.And speaking of stuffing, you can really fit a lot into one of these 28\" suitcases. And they are sturdy. At least so far - they've been on two round trips each with no problem.The center combo lock is easy to set and it's easy to change the combination. In addition, each side has a locking mechanism. So even if, for some reason, the center hasn't been properly closed, the side locks keep the suitcase from opening accidentally. All locks are recessed. All handles are recessed. The only negative I have with this luggage is that we're used to using a luggage strap, and you can't thread the luggage strap under the recessed handle, as we can with our old suitcases. BUT, given the extra side locks on the S'Cure Spinners, a luggage strap isn't really needed as an extra precaution anyway.When you open the suitcase, you'll see that one side has a full fabric cover. You open it with a zip that goes around 3 sides. The other side of the suitcase has a set of X-shaped straps to hold larger items in. It wasn't a negative for us, but just in case, I'll mention that there is no lining to this suitcase. Inside, it is just the bare polypropylene. It doesn't mean a hoot to us. We tend to use our suitcases for a looooooong time before buying new ones, and the problem with fabric linings is that they don't last as long as the rest of the suitcase. So not having a fabric lining may not look as pretty in the beginning, but has no effect whatsoever on how well the suitcase works. I've attached a photo giving you an idea of how the inside of the suitcase looks.Very happy with our suitcases.Happy Reader",

Five flights, boarding and getting off the boat, and then two more flights.I found it to be a fantastic bag, had a few compliments on it actually. It is cavernous (and the inside has no lining, so in some ways it reminds me of a black rubbermaid container, but I kinda like that), even so, the divider makes it very use-able even half full. The spinners are a god send on this size bag, it makes the travel experience less muscle and more glide. The latch system seems like it will last (but like something that would not stop a determined thief..though little will). I also have to mention that the rubber gasket runs the majority of the way around the bag, but for some reason does not run through the hinge area of the bag...meaning it is very water resistant, not proof. The outside plastic shows some scratching from the travel process, nothing un-acceptable. Even so, all functions are good to go after my journey.This is not a Haliburton quality case, and it does not give any sexual favors Smilie. But, at $160, Id say it is a pretty darn good deal.",

We now bought the large size here, but I wish the XL was available to buy too. We never liked zipper-based and various non-hard-shell luggage, had bad experiences with those, as we have been travelling for more than a decade 4-5 times a year on overseas flights with my family. And needless to say, we buy luggage from this specific brand only. Sad that these hard-shells are no longer in the fashion trendlines, but luckily these are still available at rare shops.",

                "reviewText": "I own 3 large size of the same model and used extensively without issues\u2026 This Carry on version of the model came DOA from Amazon. It was packed it a box with no paddings which put pressure in the luggage which was I believe was a good thing. It allowed it to be tested for durability and it just failed. It looks like the wheels would not survive a single curbside trip. If it cannot survive UPS it is not qualified to be used for travel.Otherwise the body of the carry-on is designed beautifully. It is slim yet provides ample space inside. Pity if only samsonite had spent few extra dollars to built sturdy wheels this would be a rock star carry-on. I al still looking for non-zipper carry on but this rare model won\u2019t work for me.For now I would say definitely AVOID BUYING the carry on size of this model !",
