Handle is a bit too widely spaced and I was unable to slip my smaller bag over the handle as the pocket was designed for the more standard, narrower span. It would\u2019ve been so much easier if I could have stacked those bags. Would\u2019ve given 5 stars for that capability. Good news is it is the perfect carry on and easily fit in overhead bins on plane and trains.",

                "reviewText": "My last carry-on was less than 4 lb in weight, so I've been looking for one that's also light in weight. This is it. I feel the bag is very easy to roll on pavements, not to mention indoors. It's also easy enough to lift to the overhead compartment on airplanes for someone like me without lots of muscles on the arms.The only potential improvement I can suggest to the manufacturer is to make the lock-in mechanism in the handle more secure. I'm petite so it fits me better when the handle is extended half way, but then in that position the handle tends to slide down. It doesn't affect the overall functionality, though.Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it.",

It\u2019s as light as can be and seemed to hold up well. I carried it all around the underground in London with ease. Some people complain about few pockets but pockets would clearly add weight to the piece. I just used packing cubes and it worked great. The only thing that was inconvenient was the pull up handle is too wide to hang my carry-on bag on, which has a sleeve to slide over a piece of luggage - I understand it\u2019s designed this way to maximize space inside the luggage, it\u2019s not a deal breaker but wasn\u2019t the most convenient. I\u2019ll need to look for a hook of some sort to be able to hook on my over the shoulder carry-on.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little suitcase that's easy to maneuver. The zippers are sturdy. The handle doesn't inspire a good deal of confidence in me, but it has held up well so far without problems. I was using it as a carryon and it meets the industry standards (pre-COVID). I can fit enough for almost a week in it without problem. Highly recommended as an easy piece of luggage for most needs.",

                "reviewText": "These are the worst.Let me try to provide a balanced review, as much as possible:Pros-they are lightweight-the wheels glide with little to no resistanceCons- the luggage is one large compartment so everything is stuffed into a deep space that makes it difficult to separate items like clothes from food-when the luggage is packed the top zippered flap buckels in making it difficult to close-because the handles are wide, my bags do not fit through them and are instead placed gingerly on top, which creates an issue with the next two points below-because they are so lightweight the wheels wobble every which way when I am walking with the stupid things. They don\u2019t go straight and I keep walking into them or tripping over them. I have to place a lot of effort to maneuver them. Not an easy thing to do when running around a crowded airport with two pieces of luggage that weigh 50 lbs that roll all over the place and not in unison- again, because they are so light plus their wheel placement, these stupid things fall over all. the. time. These stupid things do not stay standing upright. Ever. So in an airport while I am running around they wobble into me, into each other. And they keep falling overI hate them",

                "reviewText": "This case is lightweight and reasonably maneuverable. One side has some pockets which protect the interior content. The other side is just thin fabric. Things inside the case shift and cause the back of the case to bulge. With a large space between the arms of the extendable handle, lots of things can stick out of the back. Those things are not protected from damage. I filled the case with my SCUBA regulator and underwater camera equipment. These things need to be protected from damage. Only the most careful handling would allow them to travel undamaged in this case.",

A prezzo \"pieno\" non sarei stato affatto soddisfatto.Per tenere il peso basso hanno dovuto utilizzare un materiale sottile, che spero non si laceri con i maltrattamenti che i trolley subiscono negli aeroporti.Si sente la mancanza di un appiglio vicino alle ruote, utile quando si deve riporre il trolley sul portabagagli dei treni o anche semplicemente in macchina (servono due appigli per poter prendere la valigia, piena, e riporla). Alcuni marchi, come AmazonBasics per esempio, hanno una vera e propria maniglia anche sotto.",
