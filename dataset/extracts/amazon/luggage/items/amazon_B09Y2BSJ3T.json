Love this bag. It outlived all my Rimowa bags. Its very tough and can take a lot of punishment. The wheels have lasted without any issues over about 10 years and probably 100+ trips. I really like the internal expansion system which easily adds a lot of capacity. Like the warranty too which gives piece of mind. Great buy and worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "i took the time to evaluate 6 different 21-22\" spinner bags before settling on this one. Of course I was not able to take all 6 bags through the airport, but i figured that any spinner would work just like my existing $199 Samsonite spinner. Um, no.It has good room for packing and the expandable feature is much better than other bags. Having the handle on the outside of the bag makes the interior packing space completely flat on the bottom. no more uneven \"channels\" in the bottom of the case.The most annoying - and it is VERY annoying - is fighting the case while wheeling it through an airport. You start walking and it heads in one direction. Then you adjust it a bit and it heads in a different direction. Twist the bag a bit and then it heads another direction. You have to CONSTANTLY adjust the direction because it WILL NOT GO STRAIGHT.I've taken it on 2 trips so far - and it can handle the weight and dense packing. Even so, if you want to be able to effortlessly navigate through an airport with this bag, you will be disappointed. for a $700 price tag, someone in the B&R design department should have figured out how to make the bag easy to wheel through the airport.",

It's ridiculously expensive but given my history with the 2-wheeler, I expect to have it a long, long time. (Travel Pro and Delsey are excellent less-expensive alternatives)",

                "reviewText": "This is my 6th B&R bag in the last 20 years, and the 2nd generation of this 22\" baseline spinner. I like the rugged design of these bags and the warranty service of the past, but my experience with this bag has me considering Tumi.The previous generation had different sized wheels in the front and back which caused it to tip and pull slightly in one direction and caused me to wonder how B&R's product team could have possible released this design. Clearly they didn't have feedback from frequent travelers. This gen has the same sized wheels, but has very narrow and tall caster spindles that mount to flexible points on the bag. The result is wheels that shift to odd angles that are out of alignment and cause the bag to randomly pull in different directions.This is a totally flawed design that cannot be repaired by warranty service. When I've demonstrated this issue at the local authorized repair center, they're perplexed and have no solutions. When I report to customer service, they simply want me to sent them the bag to replace the wheels with the same flawed design. They have not designed a retrofit to resolve this issue, so it won't fixed until some future generation of the bag, if at all.I would highly recommend waiting for a future generation of this bag and then testing the maneuverability after overstuffing or manually flexing the wheels into alternate angles to simulate wear and tear during years of handling.The other issue that you might notice with these bags is the excessive play in the telescoping handle. B&R uses a thin, lightweight material for the 3 telescoping sections that results in more movement that I like when fully extended.B&R has the potential to design and build a world-class bag, but their R&D needs more work and feedback from frequent travelers with B&R experience.",

I do wish there was a grab handle on both sides, but no big deal. This is the first bag I've gotten that opens on the top vs. in the midline, and I think I like that too. I've used the garment section yet, but it's a nice feature.Also love the navy color - very classy!",

                "reviewText": "The Briggs & Riley Unisex-Adult Global Carry-on is the royalty of carry-on luggage, and let's face it, it comes with a princely price tag. Initially, my wallet clutched its pearls in sheer horror, but lo and behold, the stars aligned, and I snagged it on sale. It's like winning the luggage lottery \u2013 the kind of deal that has you doing a victory dance in the living room. The quality, my friends, is nothing short of a castle in the air. The spinner wheels glide like they've been trained at a luggage Olympics, and the ballistic nylon is so rugged that I'm convinced it moonlights as a superhero cape when I'm not looking.The attention to detail is superb, from the self-repairing YKK zippers to the cavernous interior that seems to have a magical expansion charm. It's like Mary Poppins had a hand in the design, ensuring that everything fits neatly and stylishly. However, even with the sale, the cost made my budget cough up a little protest. It's the kind of splurge that makes you want to whisper sweet budget reassurances to your bank account. But hey, when you're strutting through the airport like a luggage monarch, the price seems to fade into the background \u2013 until the credit card statement arrives.In conclusion, Briggs & Riley's Global Carry-on is the Cinderella slipper of luggage \u2013 expensive, but when you catch it on sale, it fits like a dream. Four stars for making me feel like luggage royalty without entirely depleting my royal treasury. It's like having a suitcase that says, \"I may be pricey, but I'm worth it.\" \ud83d\udc5c\ud83c\udf1f",
