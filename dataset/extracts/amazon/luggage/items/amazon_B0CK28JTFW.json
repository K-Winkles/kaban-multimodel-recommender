                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with this piece of luggage. It is ruggedly built yet very lightweight (rugged polymer hard shell and a tough aluminum frame). There are zero exterior zippers, instead it has two (2) heavy duty clamps that are lockable (combination style locks). I really like this feature.It also has very smooth spinner wheels that glide effortlessly (best I\u2019ve personally ever seen). Also the telescopic handle operates very smoothly with multiple locking positions.The exterior shell also sports a storage hook, cup holder and a phone holder. Although I absolutely don\u2019t see any purpose for the phone holder, other than being a \u201cselling gimmick.\u201d You can only use it to \u201crest\u201d your phone on it, because you certainly can\u2019t lock or clamp it in any way. From my perspective I deem it completely useless, pointless and unnecessary.The interior is deep and spacious. It has been designed to be able to take everything you need but to keep everything you take organized by a system of zippered compartments, so as to be able to \u201clayer\u201d shoes, clothes, etc. keeping them separate yet together. I would highly recommend this piece of luggage to anyone. I will even give it a thumbs up for its price point due to the quality and design of this product (with the exception of the phone holder!!).",
