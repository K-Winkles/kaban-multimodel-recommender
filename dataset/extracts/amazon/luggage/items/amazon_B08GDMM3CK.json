                "reviewText": "So I finally decided to splurge on a Briggs and Riley (that warramty), after tossing money at cheap luggage for 30 years...I originally bought the Baseline soft sided with the matching duffle; LOVED the color (olive and tan) and the duffel was SO spacious. BUT, I returned both after packing the carryon suitcase for a 3 week trip to Italy. Why? Because it tips over once packed. It's all about the wheel positioning....if you open the Baseline and lay it flat to pack you see it has all 4 wheels on one side of the bag. So once you close the 2 sides, the weight from the section without wheels causes it to tip forward. Doesnt matter if you pack the heavy items on the bottom...I tried four times! So I returned and reluctantly bought this hard sided version (I wanted soft sided as I own a set of cheaper Italian hard side luggage) because as you see, 2 wheels are in one side of the bag and 2 on the other, offering a perfect balance once packed. Oddly the back wheels are larger than the front, sont know why but doesnt affect the way it rolls or stands up. The compression function is amazing! I've been traveling 3 weeks now in Italy with this suitcase and a backpack (I'm 5w yrs young) and it has help up spectacularly on cobble stone streets and firs as a carryon in all planes so far. It's easy to lift into the trains with handles conveniently placed. the extender handle goes pretty high so tall people will love it; you can adjust it lower as well (which I do since I'm only 5'5\"). The color is beautiful and I dont see one scratch on it.Having the telescoping handle on the outside also affords more room inside for packing. Another reason to buy this brand, the only other I know who does this is Louis Vuitton (and for a $3k piece of uggage, their warranty sucks.)I wish B&R comes out with companion pieces in this color and only regret not investing sooner in lifeBuy it you wont regret it. And if you do, you can return via Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I was really hesitant to spend this much for a suitcase. I've carried Travelpro for the last 15 years but when two of the wheels exploded on my Travelpro Maxlite 2 bag in the middle of a three week European work trip I decided to try something else.After a lot of research I landed on B&R Simpatico as I wanted a good quality hardside. This is loaded with features and is really well built. And more than that, those wheels. I've NEVER had a suitcase before that rolled so effortlessly on hotel carpet. It is worlds beyond my Travelpro luggage.I liked this one so much I'm going to replace my carryon with a matching B&R carryon for shorter trips. I'm a believer.",

                "reviewText": "I've always wanted a Briggs and Riley suitcase, but couldn't justify it. But our fold over for suits and nice dresses suitcase was crumbling; and we had a cruise coming up with a lot of confusion on the post-Covid logistics. We're not light packers so I thought \"we really need a BIG BIG suitcase so we can get by with only two.\" But we've always taken one rolling fold over suitcase because my husband likes to wear suits and cruises often have formal nights.I decided to get the biggest Briggs and Riley because I saw a picture of a man's suit jacket being folded and put in one compartment. Guess what... IT WORKS. My husband wears a 46 extra long - and his jackets could be folded neatly, along with pants in the zippered lid compartment. I was really surprised and impressed.We've only gone on that one trip so far. But we had a lot of schlepping around getting to the plane, getting from the plane to the hotel, getting from the hotel to the pre-Covid testing site and then coming home with all of that in reverse and the suitcase was extremely easy to maneuver. And the handle is long enough my husband could put the flap of his pretty big carry on over the handle and still use the handle. He couldn't do that on our old suitcase.Of course the big thing about B&R is the warranty and this suitcase is too new to know how it will hold up. But so far we're very impressed.",

The zipper pulls that fit into the lock are way too high when locked, within 2 weeks they jammed and could not be removed without pliers.The lock itself was damaged.Well in proceeding to zip the suitcase back up it would only go half way due to the zipper being separated.Also the compression system does work at all like the videos, more of a marketing gimmick.My previous suitcase was from AWAY, lasted 3 years of weekly flying 4 flights a week and still works great.I returned the Briggs and now using my old AWAY suitcase.",

I have used this for over 10 trips thus far and it exceeds my expectations every time. My favourite feature is the expansion rails that help close the bag and with some pressure, you can compress it back to its original size. With the handle frame on the exterior of the luggage, it ensures that the handle will never jam in an overpacked suitcase. Given the quality of parts used in the construction of this carry-on, it will last me years. The price you pay, more so than the luggage is for the warranty behind this carry-on. You will truly have this bag for a lifetime.",
