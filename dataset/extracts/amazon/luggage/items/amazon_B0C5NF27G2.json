                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As stated in the video, this luggage is surprisingly durable and very easy to spot at baggage claim. To start, I'm a full-time musician who travels and flies quite a bit. I needed new luggage that would fit wardrobe, equipment, and street clothes and this suitcase does just that. When I first got it, I was worried by how flimsy the hardshell felt. However, after a few months, and roughly half a dozen flights, I gotta say this thing holds up better than I expected. We're all well aware of how airlines handle luggage, and yet so far this suitcase only has a few scuffs here and there.Space-wise, I was able to pack everything listed above for 5-day trips with some room to spare. In the past, I was weary about the space in the hardshell clam suitcases (because of the equipment I fly with), but this luggage proved me wrong. The wheels are still in working condition, and the handle lifts and lowers smoothly which also feels a little flimsy but is surprisingly sturdy. I also picked out this suitcase because of the color. The somewhat odd dual-color makes this thing very easy to spot at baggage claim. Even for someone who needs glasses like myself.",

                "reviewText": "I have not traveled with them yet, but from a cost standpoint I think these are a real value. I got a carryon plus a 24\" and 28\". They do not come with TSA locks, though easy to buy locks yourself. At this price point though even without locks I feel these are a tremendous value. Wheels move smoothly, zippers seems very sturdy, they all are expandable, plus they are really nice looking and will standout when trying to identify your luggage from other's. I have a carryon with a TSA lock and I can only remember using it one time when I had a connection flight on a Bombardier that couldn't accommodate even the smallest carryon so I had to gate check it. With that being said I don't think the TSA lock is worth the additional costs to get luggage with that feature. Overall super happy with my purchase and I feel this luggage will last a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "I received this suitcase on a Thursday, flew Friday morning and by the time I received my luggage at my destination not even 2 hours later the side aides were broken off. For a more luxury brand, and not cheap, I am very disappointed as the screws are now scratching me and any interior/fabric the suitcase encounters. As a \u201cbrand new\u201d purchase I am no longer able to return it, and would have to deal with these obstacles if I continue to use, as I frequently travel around every 6 weeks.",
