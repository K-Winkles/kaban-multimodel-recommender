The good news is it is expandable and when paired with the toiletry and overnight bag made a good combination for a three day trip. It seems fairly rugged. I didn't fly but rather drove to my destination so not sure how it would hold up but you will not have to check it.The suitcase is expandable which helped a lot and maneuvered nicely through the hotel. It actually was fine size wise since I only took what I needed instead of over packing as usual, something I'm sure you never do! For the price I feel it was a good value for what I needed.",

I was able to pack 4 bathing suits and like 4 pairs of shorts, 4 tank tops, 2 dresses, 1 romper, 2 pj's, 2 camisoles, undies, 3 pairs of socks, my water floaties, 2 tumblers, a brush, workout outfit, and a beach coverup and a kamoto. These clothes are lighter than winter wear and I was able to pack without opening the expansion. That was great and I love the look. The carrier bag was perfect for the pool it carried our 2 beach towels, sun glasses, 2 headphones, phones, sunscreen, 2 water bottles, tumblers. Was perfect. On the plain it carried all my liquids to travel carry-on. My airlines was Alaskan and I believe they are a little on the tight on the size. And it was fine. No one even checked. Lol. I did get a little rip in the pocket that you put over the luggage. But I did stuff it and was tightly wrapped on the luggage. I'm sure it wasn't ment to have so much pressure. I just hand-sewn a few stitches and it was back to normal. I do recommend it and it was very stylish. I feel it was the best looking luggage! Great to get as a gift too.",

I ended up having to toss the duffle bag because it kept getting stuck with or without things inside. I liked how it expanded, it was disappointing that I could never get it to work properly. It is worth the price for a 3 pc however if I had known I would have had issues with the duffle bag I would've just purchased the suitcase for the same price somewhere else.",
