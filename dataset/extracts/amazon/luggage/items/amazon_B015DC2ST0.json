                "reviewText": "I desperately needed a new suitcase, and wanted one that rolled easily, was lighter than my old suitcase, and extremely sturdy. This one was exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s significantly lighter than my old suitcase, which means, even when packed, I can lift it into the car or off the airline luggage return without strain.The zippers work smoothly, although I was a bit concerned when I first saw the new suitcase. The zippers seemed too small for the job they have\u2026BUT after the first 2 trips I became convinced they were much better and certainly strong enough to do the job.I also like the clamshell style-easy to pack and organize, with personal items on one side and clothing on the other.The suitcase survived the typical airline abuse without a scratch or dent; and makes weekend and long trips effortless because I can get everything in it. Best of all it has an expandable feature that I didn\u2019t expect. I haven\u2019t needed it yet, but it\u2019s nice to know it\u2019s there if necessary.I\u2019m glad I bought this bag-it\u2019s well worth the price (which was lower than my second choice!)",

                "reviewText": "My luggage came is two days as projected. Seemed a bit frail, but it's held up for the most part so far.Pros- Nice in color. Seemed fragile as I packed 50lbs of clothes/shoes in the 28inch case, but it is still in good shape and managed to serve it's purpose. Very spacious set. The expandable zipper is a bonus. Plastic separators with a zipper were a huge convenience. Shoes on one side clothes on another for both sets.Cons- The luggage lock is extremely cheap and broke upon my destination arrival on the 28inch case. The smell of the luggage is not the most appeasing, but it is new. (should've \"frebreezed\" it before I packed, not fond of the plastic smell lingering on my clothes). After I landed I noticed strings hanging from the outside lining by where the zipper tracks are. I cute them off when I arrived, but after I departed from the trip and picked my bags up from baggage claim and noticed a few more strings hanging. I would be lying if i said I'm not worried about the longevity of this set.I would recommend this set to others, but be aware you get what you pay for. I in-vision me using the 20inch piece more than the 28inch piece. Not sure how long they both will last though.",

La maleta grande es generosa en tama\u00f1o, la peque\u00f1a esta muy bien para por ejemplo meter los zapatos. Traen su correspondiente candado cada una, ya sabemos que son candados muy simples, por lo que si quieres mas seguridad puedes comprar uno de los buenos, aunque si quieren abrir la maleta la abren de todos modos... esta y cualquiera.En general, muy contento con la compra, una calidad mas que aceptable solo queda ver si mis impresiones son acertadas con el uso y el tiempo. Recomiendo la compra.Como a\u00f1adido decir, que solo pude escoger las grises con tonos naranjas, y la verdad es que son muy bonitas y elegantes, en las fotos se ven bien, pero en la realidad se ven de otra manera.

The inside zipper that separates each side broke on my first trip, so all my clothes fall to the other side when I open it. Also the separation doesn\u2019t have any storage compartments which would have been a nice feature especially in the carry on size. Make sure to fill the corners of the case when flighting as one of the corners on the large case sunk in from air pressure. The locks that were included were cheap so I add my own.They are very easy to manoeuvre and a good price for a set compared to many of the stores.",
