It held up well. It\u2019s very light but sturdy. The handle goes up and down freely. The wheels work great both leaning 2 at a time and rolling on all 4. The zippers move freely and are lockable. Very roomy. It held a lot of stuff. Made it halfway around the world and then across a country. The person I gave it to then used it on another trip we took around the country. I recommend it for a great light duty carry on for personal items but don\u2019t mistake it for a hard case for delicate items like photography gear that\u2019s going to be checked in. It is what it is and the price is worth it for what it is.",
