                "reviewText": "Ordered this for a Christmas present. Arrived on Dec 1, 2023. Christmas Day is on 25th. First trip to use luggage in February. As soon as we opened the handle it breaks. This item was never used previously and was defective on delivery. Unable to exchange or get a refund due to 30 days to post delivery time frame lapsing, despite no need for luggage and no travel in ft the 5 days post opening the gift. Seller offered to check with the manufacturer for a replacement part and asked for pictures. After hearing no response for 11 days, I followed up with the seller. Their reply, was manufacturer cannot replace due to the 30 days post delivery expiring. Seller never addressed their offer to check with manufacture about an actual replacement part. Seller very unhelpful and quick to just dismiss their defective products since timeframe lapsed.",
