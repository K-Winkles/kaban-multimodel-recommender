                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this set to take on a cruise. Please note that the smallest of the four bags is extremely small. Maybe one that she wants to use as a carry-on, and bring your electronics or if you have numerous medical devices and equipment that may work well for you cosmetic, travel, bag, etc.. The other three bags are a very useful size. The other three size bags are very useful for numerous different items whether it be sundries, clothing, shoes, etc. I did buy packing cubes which I highly recommend. I had an amazing experience with them super organized. I was able to take them out unzip them flip the top underneath, and keep my items in my own packing cubes without having to stick them in the drawers, not knowing what might be there. I felt much safer and cleaner. Especially for undergarments and socks. Items that are small, like swimsuits it kept things very organized in my suitcase the suitcases come with amazing Storage and clips that are very similar to the Samsonite bags we already own. The exterior quality was very well-made, and they do come with a combination lock device, which I clipped the pieces in from the zipper. Just ensure the zippers work in a pop open. The handles are amazing super easy to lift these bags. The wheels and telescoping are very high-quality I found These bags to be of a much higher standard than I expected. Although they are lightweight, and they all nest together nicely they are sturdier than I would have expected. The price point is excellent for the quality. I loved having a different color bag that was very easy to detect amongst the sea of standardize colors people choose . I can say I also received a number of compliments. The only downside I could say is that the bags do not stack together so if you\u2019re looking to stack them so you can carry that extra bag you may need or if you have small people that cannot carry their own bags, you may want to purchase us a strap to hold it in place. I chose to tip Porter very well so he brought our bags directly to our car! Lol I now live in the smarter, not harder world where certain things are worth it.",

I travel at least once a month and after 6 months have had no issues with these suitcases. They are so light, but they have held up great with all my travel. Easy to carry and use - the handles go up and down without issues; they roll easily (don\u2019t leave them unattended on a slanted driveway because they will roll away); and they keep my stuff neatly and safely packed inside. All for a reasonable price. I\u2019ll gladly buy these again when they need to be replaced.",

                "reviewText": "The luggage's durability truly stood out, especially given the strenuous conditions of a lengthy flight. I was half-expecting some wear and tear, but it surpassed my expectations by emerging largely unscathed. It's evident that it's designed to handle pressure and wear with resilience.Additionally, its design allows for efficient nesting storage, a feature that several other users have pointed out and appreciated. This is not just a space-saving feature but also indicative of thoughtful design.The color of the luggage is yet another noteworthy aspect. Its unique hue not only adds an aesthetic touch but also serves a functional purpose. It allows for easy identification amidst a sea of common luggage colors, reducing the time spent at baggage claim.While there are some minor imperfections in the form of scratch marks, they're subtle enough to go mostly unnoticed unless one is specifically looking for them. In the grand scheme of things, such minor blemishes are easily overshadowed by the luggage's overall quality and utility.Lastly, the built-in lock mechanism deserves special mention. The convenience of not having to fumble around with separate keys or travel padlocks cannot be understated. It's a feature that adds to the luggage's security without compromising on ease of use.In summary, this luggage is not only functional but also thoughtfully designed, with several features that enhance the travel experience. Hopefully, it lasts longer than expected from hard case luggage.",

It has the perfect sizes for a long trip of a family of 4.Quality: I already used them for a couple of trips (4 flights) and stand perfectly the hard manipulation at the airports. I used big one and middle one at the top 23kg each...and the carry on at the top of 10kg. All come with perfect pockets and zipper inside to split it in half. The most impressive were the wheels! are very good quality and run very smoothly and strong at the same time. The 4 sizes can cover almost every need and the 2 small ones are perfect as carry on luggage. Handlers provide a perfect grip and telescopic handlers goes up and down easily.Last but not least, the color is PERFECT to identify them at the bad at first sight.After the 4 flights, it was expected some scratches and dirty, so I cleaned them up before to store them in the garage. Another big hit is to keep them all stores as only ONE...all the 3 small ones fit into each other so is very convenient to store.",
