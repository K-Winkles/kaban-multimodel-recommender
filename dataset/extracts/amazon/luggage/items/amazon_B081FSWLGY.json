I bought 2 of the 20\" suitcase and each was used as a carry-on for 4 different plane rides and I love this luggage! The outer shell is a little flexible so it is more forgiving on packing your clothes. Packed full was still lightweight enough to lift in the overhead compartment on the plane. Zippers inside & out functioned fine. All 4 wheels rolled fine on concrete or asphalt, but on carpet it worked better pulling suitcase on 2 wheels. The retractable handle worked fine, but on the flimsy side when on all 4 wheels. However, reasonable price.",

You can tell from certain aspects like the zipper and material that it's a cheaper product, but it's not noticeable unless you're paying close attention. All-in-all, it did exactly what I needed it to do for a good price and hasn't failed me yet.",

BUT it has given us a surprisingly good performance. It survived an airline trip and 4-5 road trips already. No tears, zippers still work good. Long term we like to invest in a little nicer luggage. But when we need something last minute I would 100% buy again!",

Janky zipper, even more janky extendable handle, scratches like crazyI got this carry on for a 10 day trip. By day 1, the suitcase had scratches. By day 3, the extendable handle was already not working. By end of trip, the zipper was already getting stuck while zipping up the corners and already seeing weak points in places. The quality of the hard case in general feels very cheap, but I guess that's what you get for having it lightweight. Recommend for very light trips. Definitely personally handle it, not sure if it would survive getting checked in.",

Like other reviews the quality is not great, but it should get the job done. I have not used it yet so if something happens I\u2019ll come back and edit my review, but for my used version I paid $25 so I think it was worth it even if it only lasts a couple trips!",

The shell itself is not super thick, so if you\u2019re packing a lot of stuff and can\u2019t close it - I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing any manoeuvres which involve pressing on it with your knee.",
