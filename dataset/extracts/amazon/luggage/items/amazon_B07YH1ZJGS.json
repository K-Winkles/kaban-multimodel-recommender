I contacted the Thule to process the lifetime warranty. I submitted the form online with proof of purchase and photo and was told I would be contacted within 48 hours. I followed up again later in the week after but hearing anything or receiving an email. It has now been a week and I have not heard back from the company. I will follow up again next week and provide an update.Update: Thule did process their lifetime warranty with proof of purchase and photos of the bag. They also shipped the bag to me without having to ship the broken bag back. However, you have to be vigilant in following up with the company as it did take over a week of calling consistently to get them to process the claim.",

I can pack enough for a 3-5 day trip, if I also carry on a small backpack. But that\u2019s the limit. Of course you can use it to complement a checked bag for longer trips.There is no chemical smell inside the bag, and no warning about harmful chemicals. This is important to me. I feel safe putting my clothes into this bag.The four wheels make the bag incredibly maneuverable. And the compartments help keep me organized. I don\u2019t use the compression thing, because I can fit in a lot of stuff without it.",
