                "reviewText": "We have four of these bags now. They have stood up to travels all over the world. In the last 5 years they have been on small hopper airplanes in South America, Europe, and New Zealand. They fit easily into above-head storage on all these planes. They are tough. They have been drug through the pouring rain, on cobble streets, sat on, and overstuffed by teenagers. After every trip I'm surprised they look as good as they do. We have several versions of carry-on luggage and I have compared them when packing to see which bag can hold the most stuff. These bags win. We use packing cubes to keep things organized so I love the big open space with no annoying compartments. The outside pockets are big enough that I fit my Chaco sandals into the bigger ones and my hats into the smaller ones. I really can't say enough good things about these bags.We traveled to the Ecuadorian Amazon and gave two of these bags a workout. They held up great, they didn't stay wet and took a lot of abuse. They fit well in the overhead of our larger flights. But the smaller planes we took in Ecuador from city to city, they did not fit in the overhead and we had to stow them. My daughter took one of these to Greece and had the same experience. Fine in the larger planes but not in the smaller planes. I had compared this bag to one we had that is a very similar size while packing. This one took more stuff then the other bag so I ordered two of these and I'm glad. No problems with wheels or the handle or the zippers. All strong and worked well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very stylish bag that stands out just incase they make you check your bag in. \ud83c\udf92 It stands out on the carousel during baggage claim. It is small yet for some odd reason just spacious enough to pack volume most valuable things. I was able to pack four or five sets of clothes along with my CPAP machine and my laptop. That was a pleasant surprise. The hidden pull out lever with zipper is a nice touch. I felt that the handle was a little bit flimsy and didn't really lock and the extended position too well. Sometimes it will collapse while in use. The other thing was the positioning of the wheels are a bit narrow so the bag tends to rock left and right and has a tendency to want to fall over. I believe that this can be corrected if the wheels we're a bit more wider. Other than that this is still a solid buy. It does what is advertised and gets the job done. I've only used it at the airport once so I don't know how it is on longevity. But if anything changes I will definitely update this review.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to use as my rolling carryon, which is really important to me as I travel regularly. I saw someone else with it at the airport and liked the exterior compartments and overall size. I packed it for our overseas trip and it handled fairly well through the airport. It\u2019s a little unbalanced when standing given the lack of substantial supports adjacent to the wheels on the bottom, but I didn\u2019t mind. However within 24 hours of departing my home, upon arriving at our hotel in London, the plastic molded support bar which makes up the two \u201clegs\u201d had become unattached. The bar is attached by way of a grommet - one next to each leg - so there was no way to reattach it. It basically became a carry bag because there was no way to reattach it. I finally went to a hardware store and bought a bag of nuts and bolts to reattach it and keep me from having to buy another bag while traveling.At this point I\u2019ve been traveling abroad for 20 days with this bag. I really like the size and compartments, but they wheels and their support are the weak spot. It would have been helpful if the wheels were closer to the edge of the bag and, even better, if they had been spinners. The bag is unstable if not carefully pulled around corners. Much better wheeled carryons are out there.I might add I originally ordered a green bag but was shipped a red one. I had to order a second time to get the green one I wanted.",
