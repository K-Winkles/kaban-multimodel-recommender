It's tough and holds much more than my old soft luggage. They went on two cruises and came back in the same shape that they left in. Easy to store because they nest - I put by backpacks in the smaller case then nest the rest. They hold more because they break in half and have a net to hold the top in when you close them. Easy to use and roll quite easily. Haven't figured out the locks yet but that's not why I bought them. I am moving to a condo and dont need different suitcases hanging around (they fit in our cabin closet easily). Am very satisfied with this set.",

Because of the generous refund, I am changing from 2 to 4 stars.I ordered this set many months before a long trip. The wheel on the biggest suitcase broke off when we got to the airport to come home. It was glitching/catching before that. For two of the three weeks, we were on a cruise and the suitcase was empty under the bed. It was not a strenuous trip. None of the wheels on the other suitcases broke or wobbled. That's why I'm giving two stars. I will update my review when I hear back from the company.",

                "reviewText": "When I first received this, I was concerned it wouldn't be robust enough to put up with the rigors of travel - especially being tossed into the luggage bay of an airplane - it's SO LIGHT WEIGHT!On my last flight, my old trusty wheeled bag was fatally wounded with one end being ripped up irreparably. So I (reluctantly) replaced it by picking up this trusty case, as I had another trip coming up soon - My old bag had a very heavy, cumbersome \"frame\" into which the extendable handle would nestle, and I loved that bag, but I had NO idea how much I was missing.I also have chronic joint pain issues, which makes travel very painful, especially if I have myriad items hanging over my back/shoulders through many hours of travel, and having to rush through an airport to make my connecting flight - the whole ordeal makes it increasingly important that I plan ahead for exactly how much I'm going to have to carry vs. \"drag\" around with me, etc.I really was awed by how lightweight and EASY TO MOVE this case was. It's quite a bit smaller in overall dimensions than my \"old trusty\" bag was, but I was amazed how roomy this was inside - I was able to pack just as much as in my nearly twice-the-size previous go-to, and the 360 degree casters made this SO MUCH EASIER to maneuver.And because the case itself was so lightweight, I was able to pack it to the hilt and STILL stay WAY under the weight limits for this size bag at the airline.But the real test came when I took the trip itself, and the bag went through all the trauma of being tossed and banged around, and there were no cracks, it proved durable to the task, and I couldn't be more pleased!",

Suitcases appeared sturdy however upon first time use in a trip this month a wheel on the large suitcase broke off. So based on a a wheel breaking off not even through the first trip I would not recommend these suitcases due to lack of quality.",
