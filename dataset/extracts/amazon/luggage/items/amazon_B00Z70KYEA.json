                "reviewText": "This little suitcase worked great on a recent international trip. I fit an amazing amount of clothes and shoes in it, and it rolled along wonderfully at the airport. The way the wheels are designed, you can pull the suitcase behind you or have it roll along beside you, which is less stress on one's back for some reason. My friend, who had an older and different type of small suitcase, was really struggling with hers, because the wheels just weren't cooperating, and she has a bad back, so it was not pleasant for her rushing through the different terminals. (On her return home, she purchased one like mine for her next trip.) In regard to the \"carry on\" aspect, people should know that this suitcase did not fit under the seat, but it did fit fine in the overhead compartment. Also on some small airplanes, you can't bring any carry on luggage on board; everything has to be checked in plane side. In regard to some reviewers saying the suitcase felt \"cheap,\" I'd say the materials are light, so that the suitcase is light weight, a benefit in my opinion. The proof of the pudding is in the tasting, and I can say that this small, light, and very mobile suitcase held up beautifully on a trip from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to New York City, to Madrid, to Porto, Portugal and back again intact. As I travel in the next few years, we'll see how it holds up, and I may return to this site to update my review.",

                "reviewText": "I had the suitcase 5 weeks when, during the second use, I flipped it over on the carpeted cargo area of my SUV and the corner busted wide open... to the point that I had to carry it with the cracked corner up for the remainder of the trip. Since I was a week beyond my 30 day return period, I had to contact the manufacturer. I\u2019ve messaged them twice in the last week with no response. Would never buy or recommend this product again. I thought that perhaps this was a fluke but, it\u2019s starting to look like the company\u2019s customer service is as bad as it\u2019s product quality.Update: I still have not heard from the company, so I called Amazon support and they credited me everything but a restocking fee. Keep in mind that there is no warranty on these products except for your 30 day return period, unless you buy the additional product warranty. Lesson learned.",

Case stood up really well. Wheels / ball bearings etc spin really well , very light and a bit flexible - better than some other cases we have - zero damage after checking multiple times - also fit really well on overhead bins on American, Jet Blue, Surinam airlines. No problem. Zippers work well and interior compartments are spacious - no wasted space - handle extends and retracts without problems - GREAT product!!",
