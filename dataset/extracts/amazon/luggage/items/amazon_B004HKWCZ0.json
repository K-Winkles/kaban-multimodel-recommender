It easily complied with airline carry-on luggage size restrictions; generally, 22x13x9 inches for overhead storage.Pros:Seemed well made.Very light weight.Two tone color combo make it easy to spot.Rolled easily.Could be rolled on all four wheels or canted on two wheels when pulling behind my wheelchair.Con's:Smaller than my older cases so could not carry as much. In addition to cloths, toiletries, etc. I need one to carry my CPAP machine which takes up quite a bit of space.Due it's smaller size I decided after attempting to load it with what I normally take with me I decided to return it. I just could not get everything in. I would still recommend this case for anyone looking for a solid small carry-on case, it just didn't work for me.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely perfect. Gift for my daughter!!! When it arrives and you peel the protective coating off to find this wonderful shiny surface while true colors all around. The design on the outside is crisp and not too bright. For the Warhol fan it is spot on! It glides a long without any hesitation. It feels almost weightless when you grab the squeezable handle on top in order to pick it up. My daughter is over six foot tall, but the handle height was just right. Not too short, as with my experience a short handle makes for miserable travel. By the way, traveled with no question of size pertaining to it being a carry on peice of luggage. You open it up to the cutest shade of pink inside with the separating divider. There are little compartments and pockets that are just right. With the divider in the middle it is great, it was used to cover the intimates packed. Which is nice if you should have to open it in the airport. The shape and size did not restrict the amount needed to pack by any means. Using the roll method for packing, there was plenty of room for shoes, outfits and sweaters. I love the suitcase and have passed along the link for friends that were admiring fellow travelers. As well, note to self- you can't miss this cute suitecase anywhere. Especially if you ever decide to check your bag. You will certainly see it right away on the carousel. This pink one was a special price and the perfect gift. While I am sure the other colors are perfection as well. Hope you find this review helpful.",

The best part is that when I lost control of it on the escalator, only one tiny corner of one of the 34 ceramic pieces inside broke.Amazon suggests discussing quality, ease of rolling, stability, value, appearance, maneuverability. All 5 of 5!!!And being bright pink, it never gets missed at the luggage carousel on the rare times I check it.",

I already did a \"dry run\" of packing for our trip and everything fits well. My highly experienced traveler friend made sure it meets the \"carry on\" requirements, and determined that it wasn't too small or too large for our travel plans/needs for where we are going. I've dragged this luggage piece around my house, and then outside to make sure I liked the way it maneuvered and I really am glad I ordered it. Our trip was cancelled due to the Fla & Bermuda Hurricanes, but we were able to reschedule everything and now I'm fully prepared for traveling with ease. So glad I bought this luggage.",
