                "reviewText": "I got the 22\u201d and 26\u201d set. I would give this set 5 stars but it is a little thin. I did get a used/ open box set for $115 which I would give this set at that price a 5 star review!Decided to get my 7 year old daughter a set of pink suitcases for our trips/ future trips I also needed something larger then my carryon so for the price of the open box it was a great deal! And she loved them and was so excited to have matching suitcases!I would recommend a suitcase cover. We didn\u2019t carry on our bags we checked them. They endured 4 plane flights and 4 beatings through baggage check/claim. They were drug over rocks and uneven pavement.Everything still works great!Pros-\u2022Nice interior (most other pink suitcases had black or cheap looking lining)\u2022extra pockets and attached mesh pouches for underwear, socks or whatever\u2022the zipper lining was pink and not black\u2022love the look of the bubblegum pink\u2022most of the scuffs came off\u2022the open box price of $115\ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\udc4c (I don\u2019t know if I would pay $180 for the set though. But all the \u201ckids\u201d luggage at target felt really cheap and was around the same price so it could be worth the $180 price)*if you only need one maybe just get the carryon? And carry it on. If you don\u2019t want to damage the bag? To get the most use out of it.\u2022easy to see and pick out on the baggage carousel.\u2022Fit a lot of stuff, a surprisingly large amount of stuff and was easy to close.Cons-\u2022thin\u2022light color shows a lot of scuffs\u2022plastic is a bit cheap around the handle and the wheels.I do really like the set . I am very happy with it. The pink color put a smile on my face every I saw it.",

I love the pockets it has inside for smaller things, you can make a lot of things fit and keep them separate as needed. I also like the fact that it's expandable in case you need a little extra room. It is very sturdy as well. 10/10 for me :)",

                "reviewText": "Great little bag, and officially my first piece of well designed luggage!I took this on a two and a half week trip to Rome Italy. During that trip we were on trains, busses, subways taxis, Ubers, you name it - and this little bag went nearly everywhere with us.The bag is so well thought out that it makes packing and organizing a breeze. I didn't have to really think where stuff \"should go\" the bag just uses every inch intelligently so that you can fit the most amount of stuff.I did not bother with the USB charging portion as I like to keep those items on my person in my personal backpack. The bag itself though held up well to a lot of abuse.My biggest pro however - was the maneuverability. The bag just slipped in and out of the tightest places without inconveniencing many people.Anyone who travels a lot will appreciate how little this bag annoys other people in tight spaces. The material is a little cheap feeling at times but for me that's OK. It's a purposeful piece of luggage, and I feel like there are thousands that look like it - so good luck at the airport carousel!Well worth the price at the end of the day. Extremely happy with my purchase.",
