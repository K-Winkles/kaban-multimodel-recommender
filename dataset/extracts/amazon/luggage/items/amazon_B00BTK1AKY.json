                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with this set of luggage. This is the first time I have ever owned/ purchased hard shell case luggage. I was very pleased because I decided to get this set when I was about to go on a business trip.When I first got the luggage, it came packaged well, not like it really matters but I was just weary of busted up packaging horror stories you hear. It was well packed. When I pulled out all the luggage bags, it was all packed within each other. So all 3 bags can be stored within each other, which is a Great space saver. People seemed to complain that the luggage had a specific scent of plastic, and stated the luggage had to be left open to eliminate the odor by letting the bag breathe. The odor wasn't a bad thing, and it smelled more like new luggage. Our luggage set did not have an overpowering odor, and it was fine the way it came.When I had the chance to use the luggage for my trip, I was more than pleased with it. I held up nicely, and the actual shell was very sturdy. I have been used to having traditional soft shell luggage that gets really beat up and dirty. Ours was like every other case and story, after so many uses it lost pieces and wouldn't function correctly, which lead to wanting to try this new hard shell style baggage.This luggage came in purple, my particular set, because I wanted something I could easily identify from the luggage carousel when at the airport. The color was actually a very nice, pleasing color that made it very easy for me to identify. I was amazed on how well the luggage held up during the trip. I expected them to be all dinged up, scratched up, and possibly bent in, since this was the first time I ever owned hard shell luggage. It came off the carousel with no scratches, and the markings I thought were scratches, were just dust and dirt marks that I was able to wipe off. The luggage was textured, which I believe made it more durable and less prone for scratches. The luggage was able to carry everything that I needed, and for once no broken bottles of cream, or shampoo! It was nice that it can expand to let more items be placed in the bag when packed. It carries, holds, and has enough pockets to keep everything in it's place. The interior was very nice and has dividers to help everything stay in place as well.I would definitely recommend this to other people looking for hard shell luggage, for a really good price. I would definitely buy these again if I had too. They are well built, durability is really good on these bags. The only downside, which wasn't much, was the general complaint about the expanding handle having play when you try and push the bag in it's upright standing position, but it wasn't flimsy and held up nicely when pushing/ walking around with the luggage. The wheels can go over pretty much any surface. I rolled mine over asphalt, concrete, and carpet, and it rolled well with no problems or issues. That was my only issue... The handle, but a minor issue.I Really recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade and try hard shell luggage. Way worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "The design and build quality of these suitcases are top-notch. Despite facing rough handling during my trips, they have shown remarkable durability with minimal scratches and dings. The hard outer shell ensures my belongings stay protected, and the zippers and locks provide added security for peace of mind.One of the standout features is the smooth-rolling four-wheel system. Maneuvering through airports, train stations, and even uneven surfaces like cobblestones has been a breeze. The telescoping handle remains steady even when fully loaded, making it almost effortless to bring to the location.The interior organization is fantastic, with dividers that can be zipped up to keep items in place, and a clever \"seatbelt\" to secure my clothes during transit. I particularly appreciate the expandable zipper, which allows for extra packing space when needed.The grey with bright orange accents color not only looks stylish but also makes it easy to spot my luggage at baggage claim or in crowded areas. Additionally, the nesting feature of the suitcases for storage is a game-changer, perfect for my compact living space.All in all, this luggage set has exceeded my expectations and proved to be an excellent investment for my local adventures. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of reliable, spacious, and stylish luggage for their travels!",

                "reviewText": "**Note, my rating is a cautious 4 stars as I haven't used the luggage yet.I purchased this set as a Christmas present for my mom to use for a trip to Egypt next spring, after reading most of the 2015 and 2016 reviews. The reviews here and on other sites for the same set are mostly positive for durability and my mom only flies once or twice a year. I'll update after our trip.The review is very long, but I wanted to be thorough and try to answer most of the questions I saw posted to help you decide if this set would fit your needs.I travel extensively for work (45-50 weeks per year) and I own TravelPro luggage, which is the same brand many flight attendants and pilots use. It's super durable, but crazy expensive. I originally purchased the American Tourister Pop Plus three piece luggage set in purple (available on Amazon for $134.99) because I thought a soft sided set would be more durable, but when I got them, they seemed really cheaply made and flimsy, so I sent them back. My mother prefers hard sided luggage, so I looked for a set with really good reviews on durability that wouldn't break the bank. This set met both criteria and came in a really fun purple.COLORMy mom loves purple and I thought the unusual color would make them easy to spot on the luggage carousel. The color is a pretty deep purple, leaning a little more toward plum than the picture (at least on my monitor) depicts, but it's close. The wheels, zippers and handles are black and the retractable pull bar is a sort of rose colored aluminum with a black plastic hand grip. The interior lining is grey nylon with white polka dots. There is also a grey mesh that zips to section off one side of the \"shell\" with elastic straps to hold down items on the other side.MATERIALSThe outer shell of the cases is made of a plastic-like polycarbonate material that is very lightweight, as advertised, and VERY thin. When I opened up the package, I was dismayed at how thin and light these cases seem, however, I'm hoping that the reviews are accurate and these cases will hold up to airline mis-handling. The zippers and lining do not look terribly well made, but I would say it seems pretty good for the price. The 360 degree spinner wheels roll smoothly and seem to work as advertised. When fully extended the handle on the smallest case feels pretty flimsy, even with it empty, and another reviewer reported that after a couple of years, her handle bent, making it difficult to push it back down. However, this was after several uses. I can live with that.SPECSThe measurements are as advertised (I measured), except that the wheels add approximately 2 inches (I don't know the cm conversion, sorry) to the length. The handles on all three cases retract into a molded cavity inside the bag, which should protect them from most damage in transit. On the smallest, carry-on sized bag, the pull bar telescopes to approximately twice the length of that on the larger two bags, as can be seen in the product picture. Meaning, you press the release button on the hand grip and the handle snaps out to a short length and you have to press the button again to get it to fully extend so you aren't bending over to pull the bag. Each case also has an inside, zippered pocket; a mesh flap that zips closed and bisects the case and stretchy straps with a hook closure to hold folded clothes or other items in place. The cases are VERY, VERY light, also as advertised. In fact, when the cases are unzipped, the sides bend and flex pretty easily. As I mentioned, I'm a little worried about them standing up to modern air travel, but time will tell. The cases nest, meaning the 20-inch fits inside the 24-inch which fits inside the 28-inch. They are shipped like this and with all three cases the box was still light enough for me to move on my own (I'm a not overly athletic 40-something woman) without a hand truck or dolly. These aspects, I believe, are designed to afford you as much weight as possible for your stuff without paying an airline overweight fee, and make the cases easy to ship and store when not in use. Right now, I still have them in the shipping box.BONUSMy set came with three small combination locks. While these are a nice idea, since they are not TSA approved, you can't use them on checked luggage. However, they would be perfectly acceptable for your carry-on, or to use in your hotel room, although I cannot conceive of a scenario where TSA approved locks wouldn't work in these situations.Overall, I think this set was a phenomenal deal at $116.61, which is what I paid on 10/13/16. I can't wait to see how they perform in use.",
