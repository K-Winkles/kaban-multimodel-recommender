                "reviewText": "This is a very basic \"spinner\" overhead luggage that will fit over your seat on an airplane flight. The inside has a fabric divider panel which separates into two separate sections if you want to divide your contents of your stuff inside the luggage. You have the option to unzip that fabric divider if you DO NOT want the divider, which will allow you to PUT MORE STUFF into the luggage. The fabric divider has lots of pockets with a zipper if you want to put odds and ends like body care, shampoo, toothpaste etc into it's own zippered section.It is very basic but reasonably priced compared to other similiar 28 inch \"spinner\" overhead luggage.There is a wide selection of colors and the gold color I bought was \"true to the website photo\" and a realistic presentation of the color, when I opened up the box and looked at the spinner for the first time.It is easy to maneuver. I don't fly on airplanes very much. I use this 99% of the time to carry grocery shopping home on the subway or bus/public transit. I use it every day to put stuff in when I am doing errands and dont want to get stuck carrying a heavy purse and tote bag. It is very easy to use, functional and utilitarian. Well manufactured and durable. I have only used it for a few weeks - so I cannot vouch for how well it holds up over one year. I bought the EXTENDED WARRANTY because I noticed in the past that the wheels on these \"spinners\" frequently grind down and wear out if you use it on a daily basis for grocery shopping to put heavy stuff in during errands. The EXTENDED WARRANTY did not cost much and I noticed in the past the wheels grind down to a nub within one year. The extended warranty for up to 3 years after the manufacturers warranty expires seemed like a good investment. I never, ever, ever buy extended warranties on cars because it usually turns out that everything that will break after the manufacturers warranty expires is deliberately EXCLUDED from what is covered in the extended warranty. I think I spent around $10 approximately (more or less) to extend this warranty for 3 years.If you are using this on a daily basis to lug around heavy groceries, it is definitely worth an extra $10 bucks or so to extend the warranty for three years - those spinner wheels on luggage are far too easy to grind down to a nub!",

It can be used with or without the expander which is controlled by a zipper. As usual, I love the TSA locks. Probably one of the best features for me is how easy it is to roll it and turn on a dime. There is no catching of the wheels or dragging of the wheels. The color I picked makes it very noticeable if I check it in for pick up . If this piece ever needs replacement, I will be replacing it with the same item. Now go get yours!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a big suitcase for a long trip. We stayed in something like 7 hotels in 9 days so there was a lot of in and out of the suitcase, moving it from the plane to the car to the hotel, to the car, to the hotel, multiple times. This suitcase is awesome. The wheels roll smoothly and in all directions. The size held a ton of clothes. The color was easy to find at baggage claim. The zippers inside and out are very strong and the whole construction is impressive. I also found the price to be very fair. My husband got a suitcase at Walmart and literally, no zippers worked by the end of the trip. He saved $20 and it didn't even last one trip. Going to order him this suitcase for our next trip.",

                "reviewText": "For carry-on luggage I prefer a softside case, but for checked luggage I wanted to try out a hard case and I really love this one from Coolife. (I also have a Coolife softside carry-on and I'm very happy with this brand, and will likely purchase a large size in the future.)I bought the medium 24\" in teal for a 16-day trip to Thailand. It's roomy, looks sleek, glides wonderfully, and I appreciate that it has a handle on the top AND side. It survived a total of 7 flights (4 flights for the round-trip from NYC to Thailand, plus 3 additional flights within Thailand, plus countless hours on a tour bus and 6-7 hotel changes.) It held up really well with only a few minor scuffs, some of which could be wiped away.I do have 3 small gripes:1) The built-in TSA lock is nice, however I would prefer to have the option of using a separate lock. My understanding is that non-U.S. security do not have TSA keys which would make a built-in lock useless for international trips. I'd rather have the option of locking my luggage with a separate lock and risk having it cut off instead of leaving it unlocked, than locking it with the built-in lock and then having the entire piece of luggage damaged by security.2) The teal color looks exactly how it's pictured, which is to say, it's not really a true teal. In the sunlight it looks like it may have a dark teal undertone, but it's extremely dark, making it not-as-easy to spot on the luggage carousal amongst all the black bags. If I could buy this over again I would choose the caribbean blue. But it's just the color and not that big of a deal, and the teal that I got still looks beautiful.3) I wish it had one of those built-in luggage tag slots on the back like you see with other brands. The buckle on the luggage tag that I attached to handle broke during my trip. So now I will use a luggage tag as well as a sticker on the back in case the tag comes off again.Overall, this is good quality luggage for the price. I'm now a Coolife fan and look forward to getting a lot of use out of my luggage.",
