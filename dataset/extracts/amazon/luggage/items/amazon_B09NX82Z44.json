Our focus has and always will remain on our founding principles \u2013 Design, Innovation, Quality and Value. Back in the early days, we started as luggage importers, at that time luggage was bland, boxy, and generally black, BORING! and this is when the vision was born, what if we designed it ourselves? We could approach suitcase design a bit differently, sure it's functional but can\u2019t it be beautiful yet affordable too? What if we started with color and inspiring designs? What if the breadth of our offering gave customers real choice? What if we did all this but through clever design, development, purchasing, and excellent supply chain relationships, and as they say, the rest is history, it luggage\u2019s history.",
