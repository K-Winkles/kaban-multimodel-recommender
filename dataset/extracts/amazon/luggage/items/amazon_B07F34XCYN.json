I love how light, yet durable it is. This is my 3rd purchase from the IT luggage collection. I think it\u2019s really great quality for the price point!!My only 2 issues are that sometimes it leans toward 1 side when I\u2019m rolling. I don\u2019t know if I unevenly packed or if the wheels are unevenly attached...it doesn\u2019t bother me too much, but it\u2019s enough to notice.The 2nd thing is that the handle bar is very wide. It makes it nice to lean on when you\u2019re waiting in the airport, but it\u2019s too wide to slip my backpack over (which has a built-in strap to secure itself over the narrower hand pulls on most luggage). Also not a big deal, but sometimes a minor inconvenience.",

                "reviewText": "With most airlines now using closet space as storage, I was not gaurenteed to hang my wedding dress in one, from USA to Paris, Paris to Denmark where my fiance and I were getting married. Not to mention if I did use a closet, it would count as a carry on, and I wouldn't have been able to take my needed laptop and other essentials. I needed something incredibly light weight, and that just reached the limits for what international carry one are allowed. My wedding dress is good incredibly fluffy, as it is complete European lace, but surprisingly only 5 pounds. I was able to roll/fold it, and successfully fit it into the carry on, as well as rest my large 17\" gaming laptop on top. It had front top pocket big enough to put 6 months of boxes of medication in, and a longer front pocket for my documents and jewelry. When I was about to get onto a flight from Paris to Copenhagen, the flight attendant taking our boarding passes did take an extra look at my bag, most likely though because it was bulging, but I was allowed on with it no problem. Others had bigger bags than I, yet they would fit them in the overhead bins. My carry on did fall forward a few times, as it's sooooo light weight. But that is to be expected and shouldn't be taken as a negative. Thank you for making my wedding a breeze!!!!",

No more check ins for my large suitcases..I havent used large luggage for the past 2 years and have used it for 3 separate vacations to Florida! Each family member takes one as their carryon and now getting in and out of airports has never been easier! Making travels less stressful not having to wait for my luggage on the carousel has saved me hours of time during travel! Luggage is not showing any wear from travelling through airports. Lightweight and easy to maneuver. There is an expandable zippered compartment that can hold so much more and always comes in use when travelling back home with more stuff than what I came with. If you pack heavier items towards bottom wheel area when packing it with you can avoid the tipping over that can happen.When people complain about luggage tipping it has nothing to do with how well the luggage is made but is a cause and effect of how the user packed it. Tipping over can be avoided with proper weight distribution of your clothing and items. I tell all my friends and family to put away the large suitcases and try travelling light with this luggage. You will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Not sure how long this will last -- it's not sturdy enough to be a legacy piece, but it's lightweight and great for kids to handle in airports. Plus, the handle, rather than a smallish telescoping size, is actually wide and thus easier to grab, especially if young kids want to lean and push. I'm happy with the buy, but expect I'll buy another one when this one wears out sooner than others which are more sturdily made.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these carry on suitcases for a 3 week trip through Spain and Portugal. One for my mother in law and one for myself. Theses bags were put to the test! At first I was concerned about the strength of the wheels. I watched many times as my mother in law drug her bag down stairs with no damage. We rolled these bags for blocks on all kinds of surfaces (cobblestone) to make our way to hotels. They held up beautifully in all respects. They are well designed and plenty roomy...it was my only suitcase for a 3 week trip. We flew Alaska Air, American and Norwegian Air...this bag easily passed all criteria for carry on. I would highly recommend this bag for a European trip because of its light weight, it\u2019s easily carried up and down stairs...or dragged \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "I travel a lot. This is the best and lightest suitcase I have ever used. I bought one for my friend and we traveled to Europe with them for a month. We kept praising them everywhere we went. They rolled beautifully and are so light and sturdy. We got the size that works as a carry on on most airlines and they were perfect. We got the broad handled ones and they worked great. Lifting them up to the overhead was easy. We packed for the month and kept the weight to 10 kilos. When the suitcase is so light you can pack more clothes!",
