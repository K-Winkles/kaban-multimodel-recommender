It came with a *tiny* black scuff and I was able to get it off with my fingernail. Please note: there is no TSA lock on this model. I don't know about the 25in or 20in models. I knew this from reading someone else's review before I purchased, and this does not matter to me, so I still gave it 5 stars as I am completely satisfied.Everything else is exactly as described and I love the red interior. It has some very useful zippered pockets. Please also note that it is ~10lbs so if you are checking luggage keep that in mind.If you are looking for something functional and very, very pretty I think this is a great bet. Especially for how discounted it is compared to the retail price.",
