Unfortunately, these suitcases did not fair well in the airport luggage system. We used the 2 largest bags in the set. These were checked. The middle size bag only had a few scratches and marks on it after airport use. Unfortunately, the largest bag zipper didn\u2019t stay closed leaving our contents exposed in baggage claim. It also has several marks on it after general airport badge use. The outer case is not as durable as it needs to be. However, the biggest concern was the reliability of the zipper. I would not recommend this set of luggage. I would give it 0 stars if I could due to having our contents spilling out on the baggage carousel.",

I had about 48 pounds of stuff packed, inadvertently dropped it and one of the wheels came clean off followed by another after . I take responsibility for that though and would still recommend, just not if you tend to pack heavy. Not sure how extensively they are drop tested. the other two bags are still working fine however.",
