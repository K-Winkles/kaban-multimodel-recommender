                "reviewText": "The luggage was smaller than we expected. The \u2018frame\u2019 of the zipper busted during the first flight we used it on from being tossed around during baggage handling and actually bent the frame of the zipper structure into the inside of the suitcase causing my husbands leather jacket to get a good rip. Wheels rolled nicely. Light weight. Must organize clothes and shoes with the weight towards the bottom and the back because the light weight makes anything other than carefully planned packing makes it fall forwards when it\u2019s supposed to be standing upright.. wouldn\u2019t buy again but if you do light traveling it should be ok, just isn\u2019t for constant travel or rough baggage handling.",
