The wheels are great and easily maneuverable on multiple surfaces. The telescopic handle seems flimsy but will see how it holds up. The interior is roomy and I love that it has the zippered pocket on top with plenty of packing space. You can unzip the bottom compartment to add and access your charging pack, it even has a small Velcro holder. The cupholder also seems a bit flimsy but is very easy to open and shut and I think it will be a great addition while traveling.Overall, I really like this carry on and am excited to use it for several upcoming trips.Will update my review after the first trip to see how it holds up!",

But I was leaving for a trip the next day and had to use it so I sewed it best I could and made due.The ride is very smooth!! Cup holder is sturdy, easy to use in a rush etc. the only think I didn\u2019t like was that the port for the charger is a usb\u2026.no phone used those anymore guys. Lol! But I love it other than that. The color is just like the picture.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: I've flown with AA, and two mexican budget airlines so far and had no issues.Original:It looks great, however, the description didn't specify the dimensions and I took a chance. Turns out overall dimensions are 21.5 x 14.5 x 9.5. So a bit bigger than several US airlines allow (22\u00d714\u00d79). I'm not sure if I'll keep it since I'm flying domestically. I'd hate to be told to check it in because of 0.5 inches...Edit: when I measure it myself, it is only the 9.5 that seems too large.. but if you don't fill it brimful, you can sort of squeeze the zipper area that's soft to make it a bit smaller, so I will take a chance. I can update when I have tried it \ud83d\udeeb",
