                "reviewText": "When we started to make our plannings for the winter vacation we found out that some of our old suitcases were not in good condition any more. So we needed some in different sizes and this looks like the perfect set for us. One suitable for me and my wife, one for our teenagers and one for the small girl. Even considering to buy a 2nd set because its so versatile and can be stored in a small space because the smallest one fits perfectly into the medium size and both together in the largest one. So we can safe now a lot of space. The suitcases are very lightweight, but still have a decent sturdiness. The larger two suitcases have two zippers - one to open/close and one to expand by a bit more than 1 inch. The smallest one doesn't have this feature, but other than that all sizes come with the exact same features like a TSA approved lock and one carry handle on one side, one normal handle and the expandable handle (to about suitcase length) on top and 4 feet as a stand if we need to lay them sideways on the other side. At the bottom there are the 4 solid wheels which are 360 degrees rotatable and have a rubber ring for smoother rolling. Also inside they are the same with two straps and a buckle on one side for the larger clothes and a full cover with zipper and even a pouch on the other side for smaller items. Anything missing? Not as far as I can see.",
