                "reviewText": "I recently used this bag on a week-long trip where luggage space was extremely limited. I used compression packing cubes and fit everything I needed for the trip. The padded sleeve inside worked perfectly to hold my Fire tablet and Kindle reader. The outside zipper pocket was great for items I needed easy access to while still being secure. There are enough zipper pockets throughout this bag to ensure all my small items are organized. Pulling this down the aisle of a plane was a little challenging. It does fit, but just barely. It would catch on any legs that were partially in the aisle or anytime I didn\u2019t pull the bag perfectly straight. After a few hangups, I opted to carry it down the aisle. It fit under the seat on all but one of my flights (I had a total of four flights). On one flight, I had an aisle seat with a more narrow under-the-seat storage area. On that flight, I did need to put the bag in the overhead compartment. The telescoping handle moved up and down without any issue, and the wheels rolled smoothly. Overall, I really liked this bag, and it proved ideal for my travel needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a great under the seat bag! There are a lot of pockets and storage compartments. Look at the pictures to see how well they incorporated all of the storage into this small bag. The fabric is a nice smooth fabric that looks easy to clean. There is a luggage handle sleeve on the back, a telescoping handle that can adjust to two heights, and even a removable laptop sleeve. One side pocket has a zipper while the other is expandable and can fit my large water bottle. There are also two zippered front compartments in addition to the main compartment. Little details such as a snap to hold the handles together while you are rolling the luggage, were a great addition. I love that this fits the dimension to be a personal item because I always book a basic fair where I\u2019m not allowed to carry on and this is a great way to transport anything extra that doesn\u2019t fit in my luggage if I\u2019m going on a short trip, I could even use this alone For a long weekend away! Excited to try this out next week.",

To get around the two-bag rule on Southwest, I stash one of those purses inside the bag, it\u2019s very easy to slide under the seat ahead and carry a tote to stash in the overhead. It rolls easily around the airport and turns on a dime. My only hesitation is the price--it's a bit steep for what it is (loses a star).",
