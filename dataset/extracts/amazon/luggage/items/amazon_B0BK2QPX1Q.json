                "reviewText": "I ended up purchasing two other carry-ons at local brick or mortar stores before noticing this on sale on Amazon. I thought I would give it a try, because I am a fan of Delsey luggage. Once it arrived, I quickly returned the other two. The highlights: its capacity is much greater than you would expect given the size. The zippers are heavy duty and feel like they could survive a nuclear war. The wheels roll so smoothly, it feels like the suitcase is gliding on air. It has a great 10-year warranty. But what really sold me was how great it looks in person - somewhat masculine, very high end. I took it on a flight soon after it arrived, and even though it is a carry on I had to gate check it. I was pleased to see it come off the baggage conveyer looking just as new as when I checked it.",
