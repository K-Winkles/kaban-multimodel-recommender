                "reviewText": "We just went on a trip to the Dominican Republic and had a couple of connections each way. This luggage worked great during the trip. We checked the largest bag and we carried the smallest. The larger luggage made it through the many hands fine. I will say that the nice color was very dirty by the time we finished our travel, so don't expect it to have the great look for long due to the airport handlers. I will say that the bright and vivid colors did make it very easy to spot our luggage when we had to retrieve it. The wheels on these bags are super quiet and smooth, but I wouldn't call them robust. We will see how they hold up after a few more adventures. The carry on fit perfectly in 4 different planes and held alot more than I would have thought. We each carried a carryon and a personal bag and we had more than enough for a 5 day trip with many outfits left unused. I did note that the larger bag has a decent amount of flex in it when picking it up and that seemed to have the most movement around the zippered area, so I would think that after a while that constant stress will be adverse. I will use straps next trip, just in case the zippers fail when the guys are throwing the bags around. If you are only travelling by car, this will serve you very well and I wouldn't have any worries. Overall, good looking luggage for a very good price. Hope that helps you today.",

                "reviewText": "Sizewise, this luggage cover protector fits my 20 inch suitcase pretty well. The flaps used to secure the protector on include Velcro strips on each side. The only contact between the 2 sides is about an inch square on both ends. That means that the middle portion of the Velcro strip is useless. I may add my own strips to match the same way as the other 2 strips.As for the openings for the luggage handles, they are not in the right place for my suitcase. Starting with the opening on the side, my handle is in the middle; theirs is off center. For the openings on the top, the one for the telescoping handle is fine. In fact, my handle can cover the portion of the cover between that opening and the other one. Yet, my handle is further away from the telescoping handle.Be sure to compare the locations of your handles to the openings of this product so that you don't run into issues like mine. That could render this protector useless.Review for Zitahli TPU Luggage Cover Protectors 20 Inch Translucent Travel Luggage Covers for SuitcaseSize: 20\"(14.4*9.3*18.1) |(B0BZRRCSB4)",

                "reviewText": "To get 3 for the cost is a no brainer but for a lesser known brand name the quality of certain travel luggage is always a question for me...but i'm happy i ordered these.They're very good quality and have all the standard features a good set of luggage should, including wheels that spin 360 degrees, zippers for extending the space of the contents, decent quality zippers and durable shells.Each fits inside the other to take up minimal space when not in use which is excellentThe TSA locks are a huge plus and gives peace of mind that you can keep everything inside secureLike most luggage i've had in the past only one side has netting and the other straps so you need to open it on the correct side to avoid things spilling out from the one side...but this is certainly not a deal breaker for me.The sizes are fairly standard so they stack up to a carryon and checked bag with the medium bag, i believe, acting possibly as either, but i'm not \ud83d\udcaf % sure on that.Overall good quality and good design!I'm glad this product was better than i expected and there's good value here!Recommend!",
