It is wonderful and I can\u2019t rave enough about it that I ended up buying three more for my entire family. We trucked it all around Europe on the cobblestone streets and I can\u2019t believe the wheels withstood all of the running around we did with them.

Very very lightweight, rolls well, and held a ton of baby gear that we didn\u2019t want to risk checking in a bag. This thing rolled all over Miami airport with no problems.

                "reviewText": "First, let me start by saying I found the 28\" version of this suitcase at Goodwill for $8!! It was in amazing like new condition. Although, it was not a color I normally would have picked, the price dictated the purchase. I didn't know anything about Rockland luggage at the time. I was just impressed with the suitcase. It's hard-sided, yet lightweight and also has ample room inside. It survived an International vacation, with all wheels intact. That is definitely a win in my book!Fast forward a few months later and I'm trying to find a 20\" carry on suitcase. If it could be pink to match my other one, even better. I did some research and found out that my luggage is actually magenta (not pink). Amazon had them new for $65 and also had a \"Used - Like New\" one for about $35. I've had good success with products in the \"Used - Like New\" category before, so I thought why not. I am so glad that I did. The suitcase arrived in perfect condition.My favorite features are the wheels (they glide so smoothly in any direction, on any surface: carpet, hardwood, tile, concrete, etc) and the telescoping handle (it fully extends so you don't have to hunch over at all). The zippers work well; there's also one that allows for expansion. (Note if the suitcase is expanded, it may exceed the allowed carry-on size) The interior is pink with white polka-dot.I am very pleased with my purchase. (With my bargain hunting, I've gotten a matching set for under $50) I highly recommend this product.",
