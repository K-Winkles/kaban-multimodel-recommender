                "reviewText": "A lightweight, well-balanced \"one week\" suitcase. Very good.I put mine through a LOT this year on two complex global itineraries. It doesn't show any damage of any kind, still rolls beautifully, and was never any source of frustration. It's amazingly light (empty).The tapered shape is very effective (if packed correctly) at making sure your suitcase with stacked carryon won't fall over. Like all spinner (quad wheel) designs, it takes a little extra effort on rough pavement or over large gaps. Not enough to be frustrating, but you have to pay attention to \"jump\" it across the gaps or it may get stuck.This is the largest size suitcase I consider \"manageable\":* It'll fit (all 4 wheels) on the step of every escalator I took it on (at least two dozen)* It'll fit properly in the Amtrak end-of-car luggage racks (both NEC Regional and Acela)* It'll fit (tight) between the facing seats on the New York LIRR* It fit in the cargo area of all types of small taxis around the world* It fit through the hatch and in the narrow back end of a seaplane without any theatrics.* And not so large that it'll lend itself to overpacking past the checked weight limitIf that wasn't enough, it also went through transfers, sorting, load&unload in all kinds of temperature extremes, long haul flights, big airports, dinky little airports, being checked & transferred a dozen times. Held up like a champ. Better than me, possibly.Other thoughts:I'd characterize this as week-long suitcase. But for solo travelers, if you're a low-maintenance or high-density packer, don't do much shopping, and have a carry-on also? Comfortably 9-14 days, verified personally.For a couple packing together it's probably less, 4-6 days?If you're not carrying breakables, I think this sort of nylon construction is \"easier\" to work with than a hardside. It has some flex and some ability to squish, the expansion zipper works well, it's easy to pack w/o any special techniques.I've used Traevelpro's other products, but this first maxlite piece has me already ordering another size.Highly Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitant to spend so much on a suitcase when there are many less expensive options. But I saw a lot of positive feedback from reviewers here and on other websites. I also had a recommendation from a friend who uses his for travel several times a year. It is incredibly LIGHTWEIGHT which I think is a critical aspect of any suitcase. You are going to load it up with your clothes, etc., thus it really helps if the luggage isn't on the heavy side to begin with. This model has four wheels and moves extremely easily in its upright position. It is expandable and has more than sufficient pockets and zipper compartments. I did not rate the durability factor since I have only used it a few times. Will update if it shows any signs of being less than durable.",

                "reviewText": "A borrowed this bag from a friend for an emergency trip that came up. I was gone for 5 days and was able to pack everything I needed with ease once I expressed the bag. It was a breeze to carry this on the plane, perfect fit for the over head even expanded. The wheels are smooth, the handle is sturdy. The bag handle loops came in handy and were sturdy for ease for pulling in and out of places. The zippers are good quality. Outside pockets are roomy enough for all pocket items and then some when going thru security.Loved it so much I had to buy a bag of my own. Used it twice now and every experience has been just as good as the first. Great color selection too.",

                "reviewText": "This is replacing a hard side bag. Didn\u2019t like the hard side. Haven\u2019t used this yet but it feels lightweight. Has outside pockets which, of course the hard side does not have. the expandable part seems larger at one end due to slant of bag I guess. I haven\u2019t used this yet, but it moves easily, seems sturdy and looks like it will have a good amount of room to pack, especially with the expandable part. it has lots of inner and outer pockets for organization. The zippers seem sturdy. Seems much smaller than the 21 inch Kensington, London fog bag. That was my favorite but the wheels were apparently damaged by the airline and now they don\u2019t make it anymore. I am giving away the 21 in hard side bag I bought and took one trip with. I really don\u2019t like hard side bags. I never had one before but I miss the outside pockets and the give that a soft side bag has. I haven\u2019t used this yet, but I\u2019m hoping it will last as long as my old Kensington London fog bag.! That lasted seven years before the airlines wrecked the wheels. The London fog bag was plaid. This bag is blue \u2013 very attractive. Plus, I found that the wheelchair people at the airport who kindly helped me get my bag at baggage claim did not understand what plaid was. So I\u2019m going to take a picture of my bag so they will know what it looks like. Although a solid blue is easier to identify for those not familiar with patterns, and non-English speakers. Happy trails!",

Maneuvers very smoothly on most surfaces. And I love the deep rich burgundy color. Look forward to adding more pieces from this collection!",
