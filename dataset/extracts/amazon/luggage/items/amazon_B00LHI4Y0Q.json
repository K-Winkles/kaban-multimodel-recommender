The few things I'll point out though is that the handle and the lock are not as durable as I like. The lock doesn't close properly anymore, and the handle has a habit of slipping from one height to another since it doesn't lock in place as well anymore. Still, the handle is a minor annoyance and I can always purchase a new lock, but it's something to keep in mind if that bothers you. Overall not bad, still a bag I use for regular travel otherwise",
