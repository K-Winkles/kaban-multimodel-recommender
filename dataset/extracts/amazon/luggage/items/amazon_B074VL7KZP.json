                "reviewText": "I bought these when I as going to INDIA for a 20 day trip. I travel a-lot and my a-lot means - travelled 5 countries in last 1 year. Most unique trait I enjoyed most about these suitcases which stood out from all the the other travelling bags - ok not all of them but most of them was that when these come out on conveyer belt on Airport you are not flipping each and every bag to see if that one is yours. Especially on International flights where there are like 400 people looking for their bag. You are the only one out of 400 bag that has this kind of Material and design. it has been 2 years now and I haven't seen similar bag on the airport yet. They have some scratches here and there. But they have survived and I also take good care of them. But they feel like they are made of cheap plastic. Seriously when I first received them. My first impression was what in world did I just order for 400$ this doest not even gives me a feel of 100$. But i guess samsonite has proved me them and it has survived quite a lot time. I do feel if you put a alright amount of pressure on them. They will break and shatter!!",

This is a good size when traveling for a few days to a week (if you pack light), the wheels are smooth, the hard shell makes it easy to throw around, and the bag easily fits in the overhead compartments.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good suitcase. Very durable I\u2019ve been using it constantly over the past 5 months and with the way I\u2019ve dropped it and how the airlines treat it it\u2019s held up extremely well. It\u2019s my first spinner suitcase and i don\u2019t know how I went this long without one. It rolls very smoothly even though the wheels looks small and flimsy. I can push it wit( ease without having to raise the handle. But I\u2019m only 5\u20195\u201d so that works. It stores a lot and comes with an expander adding space to the bag. It also has the TSA lock though I haven\u2019t used it.Two negatives: the handle as other reviewers have said is a bit flimsy as in when my bag weights 45+ pounds I always feel like using the handle to get it ,owing is going to snap the handle off or cause it to break. It\u2019s the primary reason I just push it with the handle down. Other issue is the side handle is on the same side/half of the suitcase as the top handle. This screws with the center of gravity and makes the bag difficult to maneuver when it\u2019s fully loaded or you\u2019ve expanded it to full size. As I\u2019ve seen most of samsonites luggage has the handles on the same side of the suitcase which is unfortunate.I would recommend. It was cheap, as someone who\u2019s had multiple bags demolished by delta over the past 12 months (none were hardside) this was well worth the investment and it has kept my things dry when my bags have been moved out in the rain at airports with bad weather.",

Rimowa has very light weight suitcases, which barely add anything to a scale. This one is not as light, but also not as heavy as no-name or low end brands. We had it for two years now roughly and it travelled a couple of times over the Atlantic - it is holding up great so far.",

I knew something was wrong when it left tire tracks on my floor. After two easy domestic trips the wheel surfaces are disintegrating into a black powdery substance. Just rubbing your thumb over them takes off another layer. I'll be generous and say they probably got a dud batch of wheels for this production run, but clearly the quality control failed.Sure, I can return it to Samsonite for repair. But they make you pay shipping costs and there's always the risk they will weasel out of the warranty through some technicality.Avoid.",
