This suitcase is the epitome of travel convenience and durability. My last similar no-name case lasted about 4 trips so I decided it was time to buy something solid.The size, at 28 inches, strikes the perfect balance between spaciousness and maneuverability. It offers ample room for packing without being overly bulky. The interior organization is top-notch, featuring thoughtful compartments that make packing and unpacking a breeze.Durability is where this suitcase truly shines. The tough exterior material not only withstands the rigors of baggage handling but also looks sleek and sophisticated. The wheels glide effortlessly, and the telescopic handle feels sturdy and reliable. It's amazingly light for it's size and construction.Security is another area where Samsonite excels. The combination lock provides peace of mind, and the zippers feel robust and secure.In terms of aesthetics, the suitcase's design is both timeless and modern. It stands out on the carousel, making it easy to spot amidst a sea of generic luggage.Overall, the Samsonite 28-Inch Suitcase is a stellar investment for anyone who values durability, functionality, and style in their travel gear. I wholeheartedly give it a well-deserved 5-star rating \u2013 it's a true travel companion that exceeds expectations.",

                "reviewText": "Luggage isn't a frequent purchase and it is a serious investment (for me at least). The Winfield Luggage from Samsonite has been great. I live in Alaska and the luggage doesn't get brittle or crack in the cold. I also travel to hot places (to get away from the cold) and it works well holding up in the heat. The hard sides do not absorb water so if it rains on it, I'm covered. The wheels track nicely on both rough and smooth surfaces and the weight isn't in the luggage, so I can have more \"stuff\" with me. They look great and hold up to the abuses handed out by the automated airline handling equipment. Small scuffs are not noticeable due to the surface texture. These are going to serve me well for years.",

                "reviewText": "Bag is super light and looks great. For the occasional traveler, this bag will serve you well and is worth the price. This bag will also serve you well on international flights that severely limit the size and weight of carry-on bags.I've logged 3 cross country trips in one month and find the quality to be decent. The inner lining, straps on each half, and the separator are very well done with good quality construction. The release button on the handle has a full rubber cover; thus, dust will not likely cause issues with the button operation.The issue: single wheel per corner will not likely survive too many trips. The wheels are rather slim and will catch into the expansion joints in concrete as well fall into minor pock marks on other surfaces and cause the bag to suddenly jerk you back. Further, the wheels do not roll smooth on low pile carpets and the casters do not respond quick enough to allow for rapid direction changes.Other things to consider:The zipper pull locks are rather weak and will likely break in time. I do, however, like the lock's ability to keep the zipper handle in place in a tidy manner. I wouldn't trust the lock to keep anyone out...not a problem for me as I rarely check my bags in the belly of the plane.The handle will twist rather easily; thus, you won't always have postive control over the motion of the bag. Then again, this bag is meant to be as light as possible and yet still functional.Happy travels!",

                "reviewText": "So I chose this suitcase after looking at 3 others. I needed to replace my old Samsonite that literally fell apart. Did this one measure up to the old one? I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure I chose the best one either, but it's too late to return, so I'm making due with it.Pros: Color is gorgeous and it stands out. It does pull nicely and maneuvers well. The wheels are strong (My old bag's wheels were not durable). It fits \"enough\" stuff I guess. I tend to overpack and I feel like I don't get quite as much stuff in here as I would like.Cons: Doesn't feel that durable, as it has a 'softer' plastic like side that I feel will cave in. I wish one of the sides had a zipper closure, its just a flap that flaps back and forth that is used to hold smaller garments or socks/underwear. The \"elastic\" strap that holds each side of clothes in is VERY loose - it may as well not even be there as it holds nothing. Which leads me to the MAIN thing that drives me crazy about this bag: When I do pack everything in and use the \"elastic\" strap, When I close the bag - SO MANY ITEMS just fall out as I'm struggling to shove everything back in. Its AWFUL. My old bag had a tighter strap and also a side with a zipper closure. Anyways, since I'm stuck with this bag - I literally bought a bassinet crib sheets and I'm using these sheets as a cover to cover the clothes and items on each side so when I close the bag - nothing randomly falls out. It seems to work, but annoying I have to do this.",

I will have to give it another review after I use it for travel. I like that it has built in locks and is expandable. The wheels swivel nicely but not as well as my Outbound carry on.
