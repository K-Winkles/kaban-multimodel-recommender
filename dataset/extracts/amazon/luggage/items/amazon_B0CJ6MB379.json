                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Set of Luggage",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the LUGGEX 3 Piece Luggage Sets with Spinner Wheels - PC Expandable Hard Suitcases with Wheels - Travel Luggage TSA Approve (Blue Suitcase) and really liked it. While the description states the color is Blue, it actually a really deep teal as shown on the page. It's a really pretty color and decided to keep the set. I used to own a Swiss brand soft case carry-on that I owned for a number of years, and it started to feel a bit heavy having to pull it behind me. It no longer met the airline \"carry-on\" guidelines and became one for checking in. So, it was time to upgrade to one that is lighter in weight, easy to maneuver with 8 spinner wheels and 360-degree spin. I spent several weeks researching the different brands and about the material construction; and I steered clear of those whose description stated \"ABS\" because I consulted other sources and learned that this is the cheapest material construction prone to breakage easily. While a hard case is not free of getting damage by TSA handling once it's out of my possession, I figured that at least investing in a better constructed luggage would at least allow for some longevity of my new luggage. With that said, Polycarbonate, aluminum corners were key features. My old Swiss luggage rolled smoothly and quietly, and the handle retracted smoothly as well. So, these were also features that I looked for; and this Luggex 3-piece set couldn't have been a better investment for the price. The pieces arrived in good condition - well packaged with each piece in its own bubble wrap pocket and nested (one inside the other). This was another factor that I considered so as not to take more space beyond where the space that was designated for my old Swiss suitcase. There was also styrofoam on each end to prevent the luggage from shifting inside the box in transit. I have never owned hardcase luggage so much credit is given to the lady who posted a really great video review of this product because my final decision after narrowing down from other brands, was also based on her video review. The material inside the blue hard case is grey. Upon inspecting the first piece, I thought I had received a defective luggage when I noticed that the pull to the zipper was missing, but further inspection of the other two pieces confirmed that there is a reason for that - its intent is to protect garments from being snagged by the zipper pull. The zipper is sewn so that it opens from underneath the liner so it appear as if it was sewn upside down. I would have liked to have had the pull anyway because the carry-on luggage retractable handle was bit tight, and it got stuck in its extended position. I had to open the zipper by gripping the metal piece between my index and thumb to run it up and down and the fabric got caught a few times in the zipper. Without the zipper pull, it was a bit of a challenge trying to open the liner because the zipper is inverted so that if there had been a pull, it would open from underneath the liner. Once inside between the fabric and the retractable handle, I pushed on the buttons that run along the aluminum bars to the handle while pulling and retracting the handle a few times. There is a little bit of non-greasy lubricant that is the reason for retractable handles to glide/retract with ease. So, once I pressed and released the buttons a few times while retracting and pulling the handle, the retractable handle wasn't as tight. I also noticed that in opening the zipper on liner, there is a thin piece of foam identical to the type that is used between stacked dinner plates when storing. The foam might have been placed inside just to protect from nesting luggage or possibly as a pre-caution to prevent the lubricant from coming in contact with the grey liner in the luggage. I removed the foam, and then decided to place it back inside how it came and thinking of leaving it there. Hopefully this foam liner doesn't raise any suspicions when it passes through security screenings. All three pieces expand 1.5 inches. They are a bit flimsy when opened, and that will just take some getting used to on my part. As I mentioned above, it's my first hardcase luggage investment and all the features far outweigh the flimsiness and the lack of a zipper pull. I'm happy with my new luggage that I will finally get to use next month. I have yet to find out how it fares during my travel.",

                "reviewText": "The major luggage brands have really gone downhill recently. Samsonite makes almost all plastic crap that falls apart fast. From plastic wheels to low quality construction - you can just tell its super cheap and will break easily with the way airlines handle your luggage.... I started looking into other brands I haven't heard of, and while this brand seemed relatively new - it had consistently very good reviews from the seemingly honest reviewers on Amazon, so I thought I'd give it a try.... I must say I'm very impressed! All 3 bags are very sturdy, nothing about them feel cheap, the wheels are very smooth rolling and seem sturdy, and there is plenty of space inside and a built in zipper lock. I've never seen this sort of quality at this price point on hard luggage. I'm very happy with my bags and hope they will last me!",

I'm use to my old luggage, which just gliding along. This was like push a bad shopping cart. I tried it empty, full with the different sizes, all were bad.Second, not a show stopper, was that the inner Zippers were not around the edge of the bag, but 3 inches in. If you use packing cubes, it makes it harder to get in and out of the luggage.I returned the luggage.Found my old set on EBay new for $172.Rockland London Hardside Spinner Wheel Luggage, Charcoal, 3-Piece Set (20/24/28)If you are buying spinner luggage, it need to move well.",

We got the champagne gold color, which is a great neutral for both me and my husband. Through three airports, two train stations, and four hotels, it has no dings, scratches or cracks. It rolls and pivots so smoothly, even down the cobblestone streets in Venice, Florence and Rome! All three sizes are expandable, which is rare for a set. And the multiple zip-up compartments and locking straps on the inside make it easy to keep things organized. The TSA-approved locks are great, but the instructions included with the luggage are not clear or helpful. But we found a YouTube video that explained everything, and they worked perfectly. We will likely buy a second set of this luggage!",
