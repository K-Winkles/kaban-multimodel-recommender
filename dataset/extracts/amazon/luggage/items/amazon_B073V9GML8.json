                "reviewText": "Updated to add that the one of the wheels fell off on this luggage\u2019s second trip due to the plastic completely breaking. I Travel a fair amount, and I have never had a suitcase fail within a year. while I love the colors, I do not recommend purchasing the suitcase, unless you\u2019re not gonna be flying (and you don\u2019t expect it to last long)\u2026 waiting for you at baggage claim.*Because NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, is going to mistake your bag for their plain black suitcase!Checked zippers, wheels and handle thoroughly, all good! Durability remains to be seen, the case IS rather thin. Was pleasantly surprised both cases came covered in a thin film.I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that I\u2019ll be announcing my arrival in a uniquely blinding fashion for years to come!*Insincere apologies to FedEx for modifications to their slogan! \ud83d\ude09Edit 11/22 after first international trip; you can see if you smudge marks on the suitcase if you look really hard but that does not bother me at all. The suitcase made it out of the country and back in one solid piece and I couldn\u2019t be happier with its maneuverability. Obviously the colors were a bonus when I was looking for it in customs! :-) great suitcase so far!",

                "reviewText": "I drove myself crazy before a week-long business trip across the country looking for suitable luggage sets that were also affordable. The ones I did find within my price range also had less-than-stellar reviews with handle problems, issues cracking and overall falling apart. I finally came across this set and saw that the reviews weren\u2019t so bad and for the price I felt it was worth the risk.My experience with this set has been an overwhelmingly positive one. It has a couple of marks from the travel process but nothing that hinders it from doing it\u2019s job. It is sleek and colorful, which I found great when trying to spot my bag at baggage claim. While others were arguing about their bags looking the same (just look at the tag) and someone else found his bag unable to zip up upon arrival, I quickly located mine and went about my business. The colors make it stand out like crazy, which I like. It expands which comes in handy when overpacking and overall functions as I would expect one of the higher priced ones to.I would definitely by again if my current set gets damaged to where it is unusable.",
