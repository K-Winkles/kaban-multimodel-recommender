Then, a few months ago I went traveling in Europe with just the smallest of this suitcase. It rolled every four days to a new country on uneven streets and went on planes, boats, cars, you name it. I was not nice to these suitcases and rolled them across the stone sidewalks in Florence, the cobblestone streets in Prague, and literally 7 more countries and it bared with me. I had to have two people sit on it to close it with how much stuff I brought, but these suitcases are still kicking. The bottom is a bit scratched but that\u2019s 100% my fault. Now I\u2019m taking all three to move across the country and I have no doubts they\u2019ll be fine. If you want a cheap, sturdy luggage set I\u2019d definitely buy these again.",

The 360 wheels are a joke, needless to say he cracked two ribs due to the wheels and him falling over them!",

Handles worked well and all three cases had extendable handles to make my life easier. I fill my cases to max airline weight and no problems. Sturdy enough to go thru baggage handlers as this luggage came back to me after my flight in perfect condition. So pleased and relieved that I made a good choice. Plus the colour is quite snazzy.",
