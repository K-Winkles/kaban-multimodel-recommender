                "reviewText": "I decided to travel only with a carry-on to eliminate the wait time at baggage claim abd this Samsonite carry-on is small, but holds quite a bit. I can pack 5 days worth of clothing (in compression cubes), an extra pair of shoes, and toiletries. This is very sturdy especially when packing more than expected. A few times I thought it may bust from over packing, but the zipper on the case stayed securely zipped, and it rolls around without issues, although can be a little tough on carpeted areas of the airport. I love adding my heavy backpack to the top (slides onto the handle) so I don't have to carry it. The handle has no issues with the weight of the backpack when I need to tilt it to zip through the airport. Works great on all four wheels too! Can go from smooth to rough terrain without any issues. The blue color is so nice! Fits perfectly in the overhead on the plane with no struggles, even after expanding the case. I also love that there is a handle on the side so that I can hold it sideways if I need to. I love this as a great compact way to travel.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to make the purchase for a \"used\" condition product, but took a chance and I'm so glad I did! Almost 50% off the retail price, I knew there was a chance there would be superficial damage as described in the alert at time of purchase. When the box arrived I was a bit nervous because of a 4\" wide puncture hole in the box, but the case itself was absolutely perfect. The case itself is lovely. Spinners are fluid and free-rolling with nary a catch on my rug. The handle extension is crisp and solid. There is a lovely liner that is sturdy and thick with straps on one side and a large mesh containment compartment that zips closed on the other. There is a little case inside for a battery charger, with port right outside the closed case. I have not yet taken it out for it's first voyage but am excited to do so and am committed to updating this review should things not be as expected when I use it in a few weeks. Score!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first luggage set so I am very excited to use it for my upcoming international trip.So far, I really like the color and design. Although aesthetically pleasing, the outer shell does feel a bit thin and hollow. I think if handled poorly by baggage handlers it can break easily. The wheels work well but I do notice they catch dust/dirt very easily. The locks were easy to set and zippers opened smoothly. Overall, I think this would be the perfect suitcase if you only travel a few times a year, like me. If you travel often, I would suggest looking at softside suitcases. Will keep you guys posted if I notice anything during my trip.EDIT#1 5/22/23: Just came back from my 2 week trip and the suitcases held up well - I did not see any damages. I used the medium sized one as my checked in luggage and was initially worried it would break since I checked it in empty - it turned out fine. Although I do notice for the carry on, the handle is a bit wobbly but other than that no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I would have loved to buy a slightly larger carry on. I agonized over this purchase because this is a really small suitcase. BUT, it meets the requirements of my upcoming international flight (China Airlines) and I really didn't want to run into a gate check situation because my luggage was one inch over. Not worth it. Plus I think this makes the cut for most European airlines, too. (Never a guarantee, your bag could still get checked on a full flight, especially if you are flying economy).The luggage arrived in good condition and it looks super nice. Feels solid and I have no complaints. I will see how it fares after a few flights!What does it fit? I put my large packing cube that contains 7 pairs of pants (lightweight joggers & several linen pairs), two button down shirts and five tank tops on one side of the case, then squeezed two cubes that contain all my underclothes, swimwear, and pajamas on the other side. I can MAYBE fit a pair of shoes in there, if not they will go in my backpack. I'm leaving for two months and EVERYTHING I will need must fit between this case and my 30ish liter backpack. It's going to be tight but doable. If my clothing was a little lighter weight it would be better. Packing for a winter trip in this thing would be super difficult. But still doable if you have the right gear.",

No damage at all and not really even any scuffs that won\u2019t just rub right off. All three suitcases when open have one side that will zip closed with a net to hold clothing secure but the opposite side only has straps that do not hold anything secure if you were to open the suitcase the wrong side up. Would have been nice if both sides had a zippered netting. Would still recommend fot the price.",
