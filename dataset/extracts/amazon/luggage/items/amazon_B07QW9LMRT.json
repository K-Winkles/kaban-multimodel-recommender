                "reviewText": "I was on the market for a new suitcase earlier this year, and wanted something that would last me for many trips to come. This suitcase is it! I am coming back to review it after using it for two different domestic flights and an international flight. I included photos of when it was brand new as well as after multiple uses.My favorite things:- The fabric is incredibly tough and durable.- The suitcase rolls over a variety of surfaces well (even airport carpet, asphalt, or cobblestone). On a flat surface sometimes you have to make sure it doesn\u2019t run away from you, it\u2019s that smooth.- The handle has four different height adjustments.- All handles on the suitcase are ergonomically designed and/or padded. This makes it easy to lift it into/out of vehicles, up stairs, around a city, etc.- Good size for a checked bag. Not so big I\u2019ll exceed weight limits, but big enough to fit everything I want to bring.- Clean and stylish looking (I got the purple).My fiance even bought the same one in grey after he saw mine! I couldn\u2019t recommend more!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 250 flights and still going strong!!",
                "reviewText": "I fly a lot for work and I have been traveling with this bag for about 2.5 years. At the rate I travel, that would put this bag at being used for about 250 flights. It is starting to show some signs of wear and tear, but nothing I wouldn't have expected for a bag with this many miles on it (see photos). I simply can't find a reason to replace it right now. The previous two carry-ons I used, an Eagle Creek and a SwissGear, were both great bags, but this TravelPro has lasted longer than both of the combined!If you're thinking about buying this bag, here's what I can tell you:Overhead storage:I fly United Airlines almost exclusively. I've been on every plane type in their fleet multiple times, including the regional jets operated by \"United Express\" partner airlines like CommuteAir, SkyWest, and GoJet. This bag (the 21 inch version) will fit into any of the overhead compartments where the plane allows roller bags in the cabin (some smaller regional jets like the EMB or CRJ planes have overheads that won't hold luggage bigger than a typical backpack). When bulkier winter clothes are in the bag, the fit might be a little tight on some planes, but I have never had to gate-check this bag because I expected it to fit in the overhead and it wouldn't. Some planes in the Boing MAX series have \"taller\" overhead bins where roller bags can be stored on their side vertically instead of the typical flat horizontal. Occasionally these bin won't close with this bag on it's side; I'm not sure why, it just seems to sometimes 1/2\" too tall. On these planes, I do a quick check when loading the bag into the overhead. If the bin doesn't close, I simply turn the bag horizontally like I would on any other plane and the problem is solved.I've also had this bag in overhead compartments on flights with Alligent, American, Emirates, Delta, and Frontier. Again, I've never had any issues with the bag fitting in overheads (or meeting the preboarding size check some of the discount airlines like to do so they can charge you extra for your luggage...I'm looking at you, Frontier!).Packing: Inside the bag - This bag can easily hold can easily hold 1 week's worth of men's clothing (business and casual), a sundry bag, and one or two pairs of shoes. I can pack a few more day's worth of casual clothes using airtight packing bags for a two week trip. As stated above, winter clothes can be bulkier and take away from these totals. Any soft shelled bag will bulge when packed tightly, which can make it more difficult to close up. Opening the expander, closing the bag's main compartment, then closing the expander can usually help with this and still allows it to fit into an overhead compartment. The outside pockets - The outer pockets aren't as useful to me, but I do still use some of them. The small top pocket (where the TravelPro logo is mounted) is great for quickly storing my phone as my bag is on the rollers going toward the TSA scanners, then I can easily grab my phone back out of the pocket when taking it off the rollers. I use the larger lower compartment for thin, misc. items like extra packing bags or masks during the pandemic. I wouldn't want to put anything too bulky there because of the extra bulging it would cause. I don't use the laptop or USB/Powerbank compartments, but I have confirmed the USB ports do work, and that small side pocket might be handy for something small like an AirTag if that's your thing.>>One con in this area: if the bag is packed extra full, the telescoping handle sometimes is a little harder to operate, like the extra compression is keeping the handle from moving in and out correctly. This has not ever prevented me from using the handle.Performance: Wheels - second to none. In fact, sometimes I have to be careful in rooms with a drain in the floor. If the floor is sloped toward the drain, the bag will sometimes roll off if I'm not paying attention to it! Maneuvering the bag through crowded airports is a breeze, whether using all four wheelsets with the bag at my side, or pulling it behind me on two wheelsets when walking up hill or in airports with heavily carpeted floors like PDX. The magnetic self-aligning wheels allow the bag to easily keep rolling in whatever direction the bag is pushed/pulled. Handles - The telescoping handle works extremely well. It typically moves in and out quite smoothly (except when the bag is packed extra tight as noted above). It locks into middle positions very firmly and the bag can be moved with very little wobble in those positions. The grip is ergonomically shaped to make it comfortable in the hand, and it is as soft to the touch as I would expect any suitcase could have. The thee handles attached directly to the bag are durable and easy to use. The top and side handle are soft and comfortable; the third handle on the bottom of the bag is hard plastic and handy for lifting the bag with two hands when loading/unloading from a car or airport shuttle.Wear noted to date: After 2.5 years/250 flights, the large outside pocket is showing some some fraying in one place on the top edge; likely a result of wrestling the bag into and out of overheads. I've also lost one zipper pull, from the laptop compartment. I don't use that pocket, so I haven't bothered replacing it. There is also some scarring of the plastic wheel wells of all four wheelsets, but no major damage. No staining to speak of, but the grey color is going to help hide just about any normal stains.None of this wear makes me question purchasing the bag, continuing to use it as is, or replacing at this time.Final thoughts: This bag has taken an absolute beating for a long period of time and is starting to show signs of wear and tear, but I can't imagine a suitcase performing better than this one has. TravelPro bags might cost a little more than a SwissGear or a Samsonite bag, but I can tell you first hand that this bag is worth the extra money. I've thought about trying a higher end bag like TUMI, but my experience with this bag makes me wonder what I could possibly gain for the extra money. The next time you're at an airport, pay attention to the bags the pilots and flight attendants are pulling. There is a reason most airline personnel choose TravelPro luggage!",

                "reviewText": "Haven\u2019t gotten to use it much yet, but it\u2019s a really nice bag, zippers all function nice and smooth, the handles and trim seem nicely stitched, and overall appears to be a high quality product.The important note for me as a taller guy (6\u20193\u201d) with lower back problems, is that the handle pulls up even higher than I need at its top setting, so I actually use the second to last height. Most bags are not comfortable heights and I need to bend down while using, so this is a really important feature!The wheels also track really nice and smooth in all directions, including if you tip the bag back on two wheels. Bag doesn\u2019t get stuck and tweak your back/shoulder over every crack and bump on the ground, which is another big concern.Expensive, yes, but it\u2019s a quality product with a warranty, replacement parts are available, and it should last quite some time compared to the cheap bags we\u2019ve all tried and fought with.Size is what it is when looking at bags and it isn\u2019t like certain bags really have more space than others, so it really comes down to whether you want a bag that will last, or risk a cheap bag ruining your travels\u2026",

                "reviewText": "I had to replace my previously loved suitcase after 10 years, as the plastic hard shell frame had started to break. My first attempt at a replacement was awful. Awkward size, and I couldn't store my carry on inside of it. It wouldn't pull well, and after one set of flights (1 day, 2 flights) there was noticeable wear on the suitcase.I just spent half of the past month traveling, and this suitcase was perfect. The locked zippers made me feel confident, and with the TSA approved lock, I didn't have to worry about them breaking my suitcase to get in to inspect it. (And yes, it was inspected one of the legs of the trip!) The rollers are smooth, the three different handle points make it easy to haul your bag in and out of vehicles and up stairs. Balance is fantastic - no overbalanced bag that tips over rather than resting on the rollers.Best for me, I could totally tell it was my bag on the baggage carousal. I had no worries I was grabbing a strangers bag.And for the full bonus points - my carryon fits inside, so storage space in my closet is back to normal!",

It\u2019s does fit, but as you can see the width of the luggage takes it up to the very top of the box. All in all, I\u2019m very happy.
