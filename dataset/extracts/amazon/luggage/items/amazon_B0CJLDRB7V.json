The large luggage is the one I used for my trip which was awkward to roll but I managed. I wish the handle was more in the middle which would I think balance the rolling. The dark color I think is the best since my one round trip made it marks on the bag. Otherwise, it is not bad for the price and what you get. I do have a nice set of luggage but did not have access to it at the time.",
