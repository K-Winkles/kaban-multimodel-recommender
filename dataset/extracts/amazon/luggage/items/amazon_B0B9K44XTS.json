Happy with purchase there is no sign of wear and tear or any damage.Nicely packed and shipped. Colors and quality seems very good. Information they have provided are very useful, 16\" bag size 13.18\" L x 7.87\" W x 18.5\" H weight is 5 lbs, 20\" Bag size 15.35\" L x 9.05\" W x 22.83\" H weight is 6.28 Lbs, 24\" bag size 17.32\" x 10.51\" W x 26.37\" H weight is 8.15 lbs, 28\" bag size 20.07\" L x 12.2\" W x 30.31\" H weight is 9.81 lbs.4 piece luggage set - high quality. Nice thing is their wheels - 360 degree multi-directional 4 spinner wheels offer effortless mobility in any direction. Double wheel design is more durable.Also The side mounted TSA lock provides you with safety and security, which only you or a TSA agent have easily open hard case suitcases when traveling. Sturdy aluminum 3-step telescoping handle. And the soft flip side of the top handle and side carry handle can protect your fingers.Overall really good product.",

The two larger suitcases do have an extra zipper and are expandable (so maybe they have updated the suitcases since the reviews that said they aren't expandable as they are now). The material is hard and more matte than shiny. We noticed the box with the 3 suitcases in it was a bit heavy but individually the suitcases aren't too heavy. They roll well and the wheels seem good. The handles and locks and zippers seem pretty solid. We are going on a trip in 2 weeks so we will see how they hold up and update after the trip.",
