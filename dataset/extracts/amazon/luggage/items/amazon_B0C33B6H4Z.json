Be aware that an expanded version would be disallowed if scrutinized. What color is the interior of the white suitcases? Any compartments inside? For white color luggage, the interior color is dark grey; Each suitcase has built-in dividers and pockets within the case that make packing and organizing easy. How do I set the code when I first get it? 1. Turn the dials to the correct combination.(0-0-0) 2. Press down the button by a tool, set the new combination (e.g.:8-8-8), then pull the square part. 3. Lock the case again, and now you can open the lock with the new combination. Why would the handle of the luggage feel a bit shaky? After extensive testing, a slight degree of handle movement is to ensure long-term usage. Due to the principles of thermal expansion and contraction and the lateral forces, if the handle is too tight, it may become unusable and even cause damage. If the luggage I received was damaged, who can I look for? We promise that every LuggeX luggage will go through strict quality inspection before shipping. LuggeX claims to keep the luggage in repair for 3 years. Please feel free to let us know and the LCS team will respond within 12H.",

However, it started showing it's age and signs of wear, so I decided to look for another. I saw this one on sale after Thanksgiving and gave it a shot. I really like this case. Not only does it feel durable, it's extremely lightweight and it's also expandable (the one feature I wish my old one had). It's the perfect size for business trips and I'm able to pack enough for a 5 day trip and can expand it to bring back extra souvenirs. The wheels are smooth (maybe too smooth if you're on a slope. It can roll away from you if you're not paying attention). I also like the metal corner caps. They look good and hopefully provide some additional protection.On the inside, both sides can be zipped up, which makes it nice and clean looking and help small, loose items from falling out. It's the typical 20\" roller board capacity and have some nice zipper pockets to help organize small, flat items.My only complaint is that the handle, when full extended feels a little wobbly. Not terrible, but does have some play. All in all, really nice carry on spinner. Hopefully it'll last me 10 more years.",

                "reviewText": "I could go on and on about how great this luggage is! I used it for multiple trips in the last few months and I'm very pleased with the quality of it. It's easy to wheel through the airport, and even when I stuffed it full of so many clothes, it did not feel too heavy to lift. With that being said, I was surprised to see how much it can actually hold. I had been on the lookout for great luggage to fit a lot of items in it, and this one works out perfectly when I need to expand it to make more room. The zippers also lock into place, which is a huge win! It is cute, durable, and 100% worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "I really liked my previous carry on, however it didnt have an expandable zipper like this bag does, so i decided to replace it. This new bag really is good. Not only is expandable, it also has slightly larger wheels that make it a breeze to whip thru airport terminals and busy sidewalks. One additional bonus is that usually only one side of this clam shell style suitcase has a zip cover. On this bag, both halves of the suitcase have a zip cover so nothing will come out if you open the bag upside down etc.I just spent 16 days in southern Spain and the bag held up great. I pack light when i travel, so this bag was plenty big. Each day or two, we would pack up and drive to another town for a day or two. The bag performed great. We stayed in 7 different hotels and sometimes had to park several blocks away. The larger wheels were a nice bonus on the cobblestone sidewalks. The bag was zipped up and unzipped countless times, repeatedly thrown in the back of the car, dragged for a mile or two on cobblestone sidewalks and it held up great. I am very happy with the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Very Sturdy,Sleek look..hard shell case with aluminum frame. Wheels are sturdy and a good amount of interior space. Locks snap in tight and you can create a password lock or use a TSA approved key (Not included). OUTSTANDING customer service! Travelled with this as a carry on and it fit in the overhead bin. Did not get scratched or damaged in my travels. Definitely worth the purchase! Great Buy!UPDATE: Aug 2023I checked this piece on to a flight for a 5 day trip and It holds with full fledged superiority! I watched as it was going by the disrespectful baggage handlers and stood back and watched as it tumbled down the conveyor on arrivals. Thankfully the locks held even though I purposely slightly over packed to see if the bag would hold....it did! Got a few scuffs and small scratches but remained solid for this trip. This has put all my past luggage to shame. My only suggestion is buy a TSA Approved lock key as a back up and set a code when you get the case. Again this is a phenomenal travel luggage piece and is highly worth completing a set! GREAT JOB LUGGAGE X!!!!!",
