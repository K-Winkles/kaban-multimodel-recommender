About the luggage; it looks super nice, I choose orange to make it easy to spot at the baggage claim carousel. So far it survived 1 domestic flight and 1 international with just minor scratches (blame is on the airlines). It is lightweight and very easy to handle. I think only weakness are the wheels they protrude a little bit and they don't look sturdy, time will tell. The carry on fits in the overhead compartment in most planes. Durability I can't tell but for this price it is an excellent buy.",

                "reviewText": "Bought the orange color of this set for a November trans-Pacific trip. Took this set on a month long trip that included flights from California to Japan, Japan to Thailand, a couple of domestic Thailand flights, then back from Thailand (via Japan) to California. Summary conclusion is that they help up very well to some hefty weight inside them, the wheels worked very smoothly, the pull out handles didn't give us any problem (whether pulling or pushing the luggage) and while upon return the outer appearance does look pretty scuffed up and has a large scratch on one of the pieces, I can't blame the luggage itself for that. For the price (~$100 when I bought it), it'd be hard to find something better.Upon first impressions they seem well made and durable. After initially packing it for the trip, the big piece weighed over 50lbs and when holding it by the non-pullout handle I thought the handle was going to break off from the body of the luggage, but it did in fact hold up.After collecting souvenirs along the way, we got the large piece of luggage up to 28kgs (~61lbs) and the handles still were up to the job despite the body of the luggage doing some flexing while being lifted. We got the smaller piece up to about 18kgs (~40lbs). We even unzipped the expander zipper on both pieces in order to fit everything and despite our fears the material exposed in this expander section might tear under the weight and movement of transport, everything was in tact after our long flight back to California.As mentioned at the top, the luggage did have quite a few scuff marks and large scratch/gouge in one area, but given the light orange color, I guess that should have been expected and I don't think that can be held against the luggage.Do note the surface of the luggage is dimpled, so if you're one of those folks that likes to put stickers all over their luggage to help identify it, the stickers probably won't stay on very well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these, along with a couple of others from Ricardo and American Tourister, to replace my old luggage before going on a trip to Europe recently. The Rocklands looked great (cool orange color) and sturdy, yet light, so I had high hopes. I checked all of the bags at the airport. Once I got to the baggage claim at our first stop, I was shocked to find that both Rocklands were already damaged; one of them beyond repair. The 28-inch one was cracked (both body and handles) and the 20 inch one was dented. By the time, I got back home, the handles on the bigger one were almost falling off and the side of the luggage was completely cracked open. Meanwhile my other bags looked just fine, even though I had made sure all of the bags were packed to about the same capacity. The only positive thing was that Amazon took them back and refunded my money. Lesson learned-- never buying another Rockland product.",

TONS of room, in fact we had to 'balance' the load between bags on the flight home because the big bags hold so much.Rugged. Only minor scuffs. All handles and zippers are holding up fine contrary to some negative reviews.I HIGHLY recommend for any number of reasons including price.UPDATE! - Had these over a year now. They now have had multiple plane excursions (4+) and even more road excursions (8+).They have traveled in a plane cargo, i have carried on the small bag, placed in trunks, backs of vans, beds of pick up trucks and even outside on a luggage carrier on the rear of my Yukon for an 850 mile road trip from Atlanta, GA to Oklahoma City, OK.BEST LUGGAGE DEAL I HAVE EVER HAD! SERIOUSLY, I am sure that some of the negative reviews about handles popping off or other defects are due to manufacturing NOT design. I have literally beaten the living crap out of these things and had the big bags with over 100 lbs of crap in them for a road trip. They held up beautifully. I will be",

The products are exactly as pictured (colour, size and shape), and seem to be of good quality and value overall. I have no problem with the product and look forward to giving them to their recipients. HOWEVER... One of the original sets came damaged (cracked outer shell near a wheel), and we ordered a replacement. The replacement came crushed to the point the outer shell was bent beyond usability. In both cases, the shipping box was damaged. The box for the replacement set had been repaired with Amazon tape, indicating the damage occurred prior to being shipped to us. We have assurances from Amazon that this will not happen again, but it's worth noting that these things seem to be abused in the back end shipping / handling process and there is a high likelihood of these cases arriving damaged.",

The zipper's seem to worry me a bit. The expandable zipper on the large case jams when you try to unzip, and takes a bit of force. The other zippers seem fine. For the price you have to expect the quality not to be as good and can't complain. The inside pockets are really nice, I like that you can separate the top and bottom compartments.

If I could go back and do it all again, I\u2019d have spent more money and got a better luggage set. Really not worth it.UPDATE - sent in the warranty claim along with the $40 money order early April as soon as I returned from trip. FYI - luckily I kept the tags that came on the luggage because I needed that for the warranty claim. It\u2019s June 30th - NOT A WORD BACK!!!! So disappointed - be warned!!!!Shell cracked after ONE trip! Bought early specifically for a vacation in March and \u201creturn window\u201d closed before we even took our vacation, so can\u2019t return.
