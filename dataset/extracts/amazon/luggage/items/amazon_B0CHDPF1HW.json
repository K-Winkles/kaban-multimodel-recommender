                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Holds a lot, better than the Samsonite Winfield 3 DLX 28, customer service was excellent!",
                "reviewText": "I will say first and foremost, Amazon price fixes (along with any other item that is this way) the suitcases to encourage buyers to buy the used product that is taking up their inventory, before selling the new product at what should be lower than the used prices, or at the same cost that the used prices are. THIS IS GOUGING, PLAIN AND SIMPLE - AMAZON!That being said, the suitcases scuff easily, but that's with pretty much any manufacturer. If you want to buy a durable suitcase, that has \"cosmetic\" damage, get this, take some Dawn and a microfiber cloth, and wipe it down, add a little bit of Dawn to both insides of the suitcase, spray/rinse really well with a garden hose, use a sanitizer like Clorox disinfecting spray or Febreeze sanitizing spray, and let dry really well.The suitcase was actually a few dollars less than the Samsonite. In 2022, the Samsonite was used once for a roundtrip plane ride from Ohio to Texas, with one layover. It did not make the return trip, as it cracked at a seam in the body of the outside shell. I blame this on two things: The Samsonite has more of a \"rigid\" one piece design on both sides of the case, whereas the Traveler's Choice has a \"softer\" feel, but is still very durable. The other is that there are really only three touch points on the Samsonite, whereas - there are actually five touch points on the Traveler's and I really do think that if you loaded it heavy, it still makes it easier for airline workers to maneuver better than the Samsonite!The TC does not feel flimsy at all, is very, very easy to clean and it is just as maneuverable as the Samsonite. I've used it this year so far in multiple trips from Texas, to PA, to Baltimore (Baltimore TSA sucks, and can kiss my you know what) and all up and down the east and gulf coast, and it has held it's own very well. There are a few scuffs that it's picked up, but I seriously do not care because the shell hasn't cracked and everything has been safe in it.I will say that the first time I used it, I had a trip where I had to pack it with the items that I did, and things got to be very tight, to the point where I had to grip the zipper pulls and they are very, very soft. One of them broke, and I was not happy, even with the fit being tight, the pull should not have bent. I called Amazon about this, and all they wanted to do was have me return the whole suitcase, and then once receiving it, have another one sent out. With my travels, this wouldn't have worked very well. So, they gave me the number to TC. Unfortunately, they gave me the number to Traveler's Insurance, which was not right at all. After some internet sleuthing, I came across the number of TC and in very short order was able to get a hold of a representative who was EXTREMELY professional, and immediately issued an order for replacement pulls to be sent out! On their website, it shows there's a backorder for the pulls, at least over three weeks, which is no bueno for me. I got the replacements in less than four business days, and was able to get the old one off and put the new one on quickly. The replacements are just as cheap as the factory ones.Other than improving the zipper pulls, I'd buy this again in a heartbeat, based off of customer service, and design of the suitcase.",

                "reviewText": "Waited a while before writing this review so I could test out the case. This suitcase has travelled from U.S. to Spain and many States in the U.S. as I travel for work often. The case is light and uniquely positioned handles make it easy to lift out of car trunks, onto weight scales and off of luggage carousels. Wheels awork well and make it easy to push around on both smooth and rougher/sidewalk surfaces. It\u2019s been banged up by many airport luggage handlers and still looks good so I can tell the material doesn\u2019t stuff up easily. The unusual look of this case receives comments from airport strangers who seem to like it. The pull up handle seems sturdy and allows for attaching carry on luggage.If I had to criticize anything about the case it would be that the narrow, tall shape makes it a bit top heavy and it tips over more easily when hitting a wheel obstacle than other lower cases I\u2019ve had. Overall, I would by this suitcase again if I needed another case.",

                "reviewText": "I'd like to say first of all that this thing can hold a ton. The square style design with the 70/30 open allows for you to pack an amazing amount of stuff. I bought this for (and took it on) a two week trip to Japan. It handled the entire trip phenomenally. It still looks to be in solid shape after two different airlines and two different Japanese local shipping companies each handled it twice.The handles on it make picking it up and moving it around great because it is a bit tall. In small Japanese hotel rooms in Tokyo it standing upright and taking up reduced floor space was amazing. I was easily able to fit a full set of clothing plus winter items (packable shell jacket, insulated hiking style boots, dress clothes in the upper zipper portion), and could easily blow passed airline weight limits with this thing.It also made adjusting for Christmas gifts I came home with easy and kept them nice and safe during transit.Overall I'm incredibly happy with this. It sits right at the cutoff for Delta/Shinkansen luggage size limits. It maneuvers well and in general I'm happy with all the features. Because it is tall if you pack heavier items in the top it can get a little top heavy, so make sure to go bulkier stuff on the bottom and you'll be set.",

                "reviewText": "This truck we originally saw in a department store. We knew as soon as we saw it that we had to have it. This trunk is substantial! Its corners are heavily protected and clearly well built. The handle has multiple stopping points for convenience for anyone of any height. The handle is ergonomic and the trunk moves very smooth. I could not recommend this trunk more.",
