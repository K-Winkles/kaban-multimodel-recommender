This is the 4th one we've bought - used the other 3 for about 9 months. All have easy maneuverability and other simple and sturdy construction.",

                "reviewText": "So I got this a year ago and bought it because I had other Samsonite luggage that I\u2019ve had for a good 10 years. This set doesn't live up yo Samsonite quality and stuck with it at this point.First one of the zipper pulls just came right off as if I shaved it off when I pulled it. Then another pulled tab came off and finally a third one came off.I started the warranty process amd sent pictures. They said I had to deliver the luggage to one of their dealers, which is about 40 minutes away from me, amd then they would charge me $20 to ship it yo NY. After contacting them I was told I could pay to ship it to them directly. If they found it didn\u2019t fall under the warranty I would have to pay to have it shipped back in for the repair.I sent them pictures and yet they still couldn\u2019t tell me if it fell under warranty the idea of having to pay at least $40 to ship it back-and-forth for them to tell me if it under warranty was insane I\u2019ll be better off buying new suitcases.",
