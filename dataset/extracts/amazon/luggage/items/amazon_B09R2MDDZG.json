Absolutely gorgeous inside and out!!! A bit stronger than other suitcases out there yet not too heavy. The orange material inside is a rusty orange which is also beautiful. Everything as described. Seem to be well made inside and out. These were more expensive than others but I wanted something different yet classy and could hold up in a beating. I\u2019d sure I will get lots of compliments.

It needs a handle on the bottom of the bag to allow easy lifting and loading - I had to awkwardly sling this beast into the car and onto the bed several times while traveling, which is never an issue with my bottom handle bags. This bag does not expand (it is a rigid clamshell-type bag), so if you're prone to overpacking or shopping on trips, I would use compression packing cubes to avoid popping a zipper when you're reaching capacity. If you're planning to check this bag at the airport, add a suitcase cover to protect the beautiful outer shell from airport grime/scuffing. Beautiful bag, lots of compliments.",

Also has a stop and go button so you can lock it to prevent sliding on trains/buses at airport transfers.Super chic, sturdy and has plenty of room for essentials. Only con I would state is it scratches rather easily so I'm always cleaning the light colored exterior. But I love the way it looks so it's a small price to pay!",

                "reviewText": "This is not only beautiful, it is very well designed and made. The zippers work well. The locks operate well. I absolutely love how the liners separate the 2 sides and secure the contents of the sides completely. They roll very well. I didn\u2019t need to use the break, but I\u2019m sure it works great. The handle raises smoothly, though I would like it to be a bit taller. I bought white and it did get pretty scuffed up on our first trip. I waited until I got home to clean it. Most of the marks came off with little effort. But some would not. I even used a toothpick to clean between the ridges. It was a process. Took me about an hour to clean 2 suitcases. My suitcases do not look brand new, but the don\u2019t look bad either.The only improvement I have is to change the texture of the outer shell of the suitcase. It is hard plastid with a sharp ridge pattern. Every time my knee or ankle hit the suitcases, it scraped my skin off. A couple times I was actually bleeding. So wear heavy long pants when you travel with these. I suggest jeans. The suitcases scraped my bare legs and when I wore my yoga pants. OUCH! We primarily travel to tropical areas so this will be an ongoing problem for us. I docked a star because of the battle wounds I received on our trip.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I travel like crazy for work, I'm going to finish this year with ~230k miles (actual miles, no bonuses counted). I've been using Tumi for years, mostly a carry-on size. But lately, I've been wanting to pack some workout shoes/clothes, and sometimes need to pack a warm winter jacket, so carry-on was becoming a pain and too small. So I purchased this Delsey Chatelet.I initially purchased: one medium brown, one medium white for my wife, one large brown, and one carry-on brown. As such, I will cross-post this review to the other models/sizes as well.This luggage looks really good, I mean it looks designer style. Frankly, it looks better than the Rimowa that I was considering buying that was like double to triple the cost. The Delsey is super high quality, inside and out. And the wheels are so smooth! It rolls really effortlessly on hard surfaces, although sometimes on carpet it requires a little more force to get it to start rolling, but not a big deal.The quality of the materials is top notch. The shell is super hard, the zippers are high quality, the lock works well, the popup handle is well constructed.A note on clamshell design:This type of luggage is obviously a clamshell design that opens in the middle, which means that you must put the entire luggage on a flat surface like a bed or floor to open it and pack/unpack. This means that you cannot easily use the luggage rack provided in most hotel rooms. This is quite different if you're coming from a design with a single major compartment and a suiter, It takes some getting used to, but I've adjusted to it and don't mind it.A note of caution on the white color:The white color looks really awesome, my wife really liked it, but after just a single trip, it already showed some dark scuff marks from baggage handling. We ended up wiping it down and returning it and replacing it with a brown unit. If you are willing to live with scuff marks, then fine, but just be aware that it will scuff easily. On the other hand, the brown color shows no noticeable scuff marks after 3 trips now.Great luggage, buy it, you won't regret it. And people at the airport stare at your fancy luggage!",
