These are not only lightweight and durable (used for 2 international flights) but they look great! The Cheetah print was easily distinguishable on the luggage conveyor. The clarity of the print image itself looks good - I was worried the print would not look crisp and look \"cheap\".

Love how easy they roll :) in my picture it also shows a smaller carry on bag, that was bought separately from the set. Also, the medium suitcase was used for a week beach vacation. It can hold a lot!! :)",
