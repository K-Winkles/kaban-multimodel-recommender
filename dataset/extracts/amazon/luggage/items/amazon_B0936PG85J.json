The handle will lock when fully extended so that you can push or pull the suitcase. When fully recessed, the handle will also be locked, which greatly reduces the risk of damage when not in use and is easy to operate.",
            "360\u00b0 Silent Double-Row Spinner Wheels\uff1aWith four 360-degree rotating wheels, the Softside Luggage Set can rotate silently and smoothly, making it easy to move. All parts roll upright, so there is no weight on the arms and travel is easy.",
            "Secure Combination TSA Lock\uff1aThe TSA lock installed on the side only allows the TSA agent to check your luggage without damaging the lock while traveling. The zipper is not easy to be pierced by sharp tools (such as pens) to better protect the softside luggage and privacy.",
            "Large and Convenient Capacity Design\uff1aPadded handles on the top and sides provide comfort when lifting a full-packed suitcase, making luggage easy to carry. There are two large external pockets for storing the last items. Full zipper internal dividers and cross straps increase the organization of the packaging. The cross strap protects the baggage in the luggage to prevent movement that may cause damage, and also helps to keep baggage organized."

                "reviewText": "I bought this set as an afterthought and was a bit in a hurry to have a new set for a trip. I spent a couple of days, at 3-4 hours each, browsing for luggage. Can\u2019t tell you how much fun that was\ud83d\ude44. I decided on my set of burgundy, trio 28\u201d24\u201d20\u201d. The fact is; this luggage is not just good, but very good. Certain things are important as in the wheels and casters, zippers, compartments and outer shell material.The wheels are quality metal with polyurethane treads. (Very quiet for hotel hallways or concrete and wooden floors). Each piece spins nicely and doesn\u2019t drag.The zippers are strong and metal. They glide nicely and don\u2019t usually hang up when shutting or opening. The outer material is very tough and should never tear or give me any problems. The burgundy color with black trim looks very cool and I even received a compliment. The inside compartments are the standard pockets with decent elastic and quality zippers on them also. I really enjoy the built in combination locks. I have been accustomed to using small padlocks and carrying keys. The outside of the luggage has two zippered compartments with same strong zippers and work well. The handles on them are plastic but I see no reason why I should have any issues with them. They extent nicely, lock in the right places, and extend extremely long so I don\u2019t need to slouch or lean to pull them behind me. I am 5\u201910\u201dThe insides are lined in satin type material that should hold up over time. All three pieces for under $200 seems like a bargain to me. I\u2019m satisfied with the purchase and recommend the type and brand.",

                "reviewText": "I had my first opportunity to actually use these for travel this past weekend, and they did not disappoint. The largest of the suitcases is a little bit smaller than I'd like, but the dimensions are given, so I knew what I was getting. They are lightweight, as advertised, but seem solidly constructed with quality materials. The rollers on these suitcases are really amazing. I could not believe how easily the suitcases glided across the floor. You almost have to be careful that they don't get away from you. Hopefully, that continues over time. The zippers and extending handles appear to be solid, and they functioned as expected. After returning home, I thoroughly inspected the suitcases for damage, and really couldn't even find a scuff mark. The locks also seem to work well. The carryon is the right size to fit overhead. The bins were pretty small, but it fit perfectly. So, yes, it was only one trip, but these suitcases met all of my expectations.Update 1/27/24: After just completing another trip with this luggage, I continue to be very satisfied with its overall performance and durability. Glad I bought them and would buy them again.",

I purchased some straps to keep them together when rolling them to my hotel room. I have not taken them on an air trip, so can't vouch for how they would hold up against the baggage handlers. But they seem to be sturdily built. Love the color and style. Zipper all work smoothly, and the extendable handles work great. Happy with my purchase.",

Not only were they a beautiful deep blue but the material was heavy duty, easy to clean, high quality and they tuck into one another easily for storage. The wheels were WONDERFUL and allow for easy movement vs the other suitcases we had to drag behind us. The wheels are large & heavy duty compared to most which is ideal for those who are always on the move. I highly recommend these suitcases.",

Checked all the zippers and every side of the suitcases and all are in perfect shape. Very maneuverable. Lots of storage space. I can't yet speak to durability because I won't be using the 3-piece set until October when I leave for a 3-month stay in Europe. We'll see how well it holds up after the airlines get through with it. Even if it is not as durable as it looks, I only paid $126 for the entire set -- an unbelievable price for luggage that looks four times that price. If it doesn't hold up and I have to trash it, I won't feel bad. However, I'm hoping that all the reviews were accurate and the luggage performs as well as the reviewers claim.",
