One is with snaps and the other a zipper. Nice and secure!The only downside is that is that it doesn't come with a lock. But that didn't stop me from buying these. The wheels are amazing and glide across the airport floor. My luggage made it safe through the airports and flying.I was able to stuff an entire box full of bags for our business expo using the extension zipper. It was great!I will use again most definitely!",

                "reviewText": "Here\u2019s the gist, I love them. Lots of space and the pockets make great use of the interior and allow for smarter packing. The big test was 10 days all across Europe and they held up great and I had more than enough room to go and to bring back souvenirs (I\u2019m an over packer for sure!). I was impressed when we needed to walk about 2 miles on the the cobblestone streets and the wheels did great!Full story is that we purchased two of these before a coast to coast flight in the US. We were gone for 12 days and found that we had more than enough room. I then took the pink one for 4 more coast to coast flights and it is now pretty scratched on the outside and 1 or 2 shallow dents, but it doesn\u2019t bother me much. It\u2019s held up great otherwise! The green one is not nearly as scratched but hasn\u2019t traveled as much. I would certainly buy these again. The only issue has been the scratched exterior so maybe get one of those bags that covers them for the flights?",

                "reviewText": "We bought the 24inch suitcase for an upcoming international trip. We tried them out on a shorter trip to Hawaii last week. They are very lightweight, and easy to maneuver, the wheels seem to work great. When packed, my bag weighed 37 pounds, and I didn't have any trouble with the handle on top or on the side. It actually fit more items than I thought it would for its size. I'm optimistic about our next trip, will update if there are any problems, but so far it seems to be a good value!UPDATE: After 14 months, the handle broke on my suitcase, the screw that holds the top piece to the retractable bars fell out. The suitcase otherwise looks great, the black plastic on the underside near the wheels came loose earlier, but no other issues and the outside is not scuffed (Thanks Delta!). I emailed customer service due to the 10 year warranty and will update any resolution.",

Luggage is nice. New for me to have hard case no out side pockets. An adjustment. Love that separate inside zips close. That flap has pockets. To keep organized. Wheels are easy rolling and turning. Super light weight. Handle adjust up and down easily. Stable. Wish it had the new built in locks. No going to trouble to send back. Adapt and overcome. Minor problem",

I really wanted to have a set similar to the Bric\u2019s with the cream and cognac leather, but just couldn\u2019t stomach the expense after reading reviews\u2026so I came back to my tried-and-true. I\u2019m honestly hoping these last like my first ones (purchased January of 2016). My husband travels over seas for work every other month and we have had no issues with anything about them being destroyed by airline workers. The originals I have are white and black and my only complaint of those were the scuffs were so visible and small tears to interior lining that in no way made them unusable. I\u2019m only buying a new set that is mine\u2014he can have the OG\u2019s\ud83d\ude02. This time around I purchased the gold/champagne colored ones. They\u2019re quite nice. My main goal is to be able to spot them at baggage claim. Hopefully I never have to come report anything different! Posting photos of the largest ones side by side\u2014white is the one that has lasted more global travel than the average luggage sees!",

Extremely lightweight, the dark teal/emerald color is beautiful and unique. The zippers quite smooth. One thing I would change is with how smooth the zipper is, adding a clipping or locking feature to make the zipper parts stay together. I haven\u2019t had any accidents but, because it moves so easily have been tying them together before checking the bag. But I absolutely love it!!!",

                "reviewText": "I got an amazing deal on the medium-size luggage during Prime Day before the pandemic so it sat in my closet for a while, but I've finally started using it over the last year. It has gone on 3 round trips with layovers (so 12 flights total and 6 rounds on the carousel) and a road trip. I've dragged it over curbs, sidewalks, gravel, and all sorts of hotel surfaces and hauled it into cabs and rental car trunks. It has some scratches, as expected, but no dents, and all wheels, zippers, and handles are still perfectly functional. I can't seem to pack light so I have used it fully expanded and packed to its maximum capacity for longer trips.I use packing cubes and also have heavy-duty luggage straps to lighten the load on the zippers and joints. I love that I can immediately recognize my luggage on the carousel with the gorgeous rose gold color and luggage straps. I also purchased a separate TSA lock since the luggage doesn't have one built in.Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase and definitely think it was worth every penny.",
