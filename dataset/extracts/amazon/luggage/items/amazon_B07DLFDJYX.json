                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Became a customer for life: excellent carry-on, amazing customer service",
                "reviewText": "I bought the 21-inch spinner in 2019, and had a minor break over time here in Sept 2022. TravelPro's customer service blew me away here, and I'm now here as a new customer for life of TravelPro.I've flown about 150k miles with the bag since then (even with the pandemic), and the bag developed a few scuffs, especially when I've had to check the bag. A zipper broke and a zipper pull got lost, so I submitted the warranty claim, expecting a repair. Instead, I got an entire replacement, which legitimately floored me. I had heard stories about TravelPro's excellent customer service, but it wasn't until this that I believed them. It took less than a month between submitting the claim and getting the replacement. Just make sure you register the bag immediately! I'll probably never stop using TravelPro from now on, and I've been eyeing the 25\" spinner...I found this bag via the Wirecutter's recommendation for carry-on bags in 2019. Back then I was flying for work and spending 3 nights a week on the road every week. My carry-on broke on a Monday morning one week (thankfully after getting off the plane), so I needed a quick replacement before going home.The gold standard for consultants is often TUMI or Briggs and Riley, but I didn't feel like I was ready to jump from my ~$50 carry-on to a $800 monster. Other colleagues praised TravelPro as a solid step in-between, so seeing the Wirecutter's recommendation let me feel comfortable enough to do the 2-day Prime delivery on it, and sent to my hotel.I've been using the bag since then, and I've been very happy with it. The wheels are disproportionately large compared to the bag, and this is excellent - the wheels glide very smoothly and never jam, even when on European cobblestones. The wheels lock in alignment, so on smooth airport surfaces, I can push and let go, and expect the bag to stay rolling with me if I need to switch hands of something I'm carrying. The telescoping handle is so sturdy, which was a relief because that's what broke on my old bag. Importantly with spinners, this bag is well balanced - I've never had it fall over when I've had my hand-carry bag on top it, whereas my old bag required careful packing to avoid it being unbalanced.Main quibbles: Unfortunately, the comfortable grab handle on the telescope is too big for the luggage passthrough on the backpack I was using (an Ecogear), so be careful on that. The electronic battery cable is a gimmick in my opinion, and I've never found value in it. The capacity is large, but I find the telescoping handle makes the interior space a bit weird to use.To this day, I've found myself continuing to use this bag, even if my travel plans and baggage allowances would have meant I would have previously used a larger checked bag. I supplement it with a duffel for extra stuff and will check that instead, but this 21\" TravelPro is so good that it has changed my travel and bag packing strategy permanently.This is what a true 10/10 on the Net Promoter Score looks like - I hands-down recommend this bag because it's smartly-designed, well-built, and comes with amazing customer service.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best carry on bag I have ever owned and used. The dimensions are PERFECT for a carry on, and it fits within current carry on regulations.I like this even more than the Away hard shell luggage I tried. I found the Away luggage much harder to use. You have to place the Away luggage on a large flat surface so you can open the whole thing. The Away luggage hard shell also makes zipping up the luggage a bit more awkward. I love that you can place the Travelpro on a chair, desk, etc. and open it up easily.I also purchased this to replace a previous Samsonite carry on spinner. Samsonite is the worst, they do not back up or stand behind their products at all. A wheel broke (this luggage was only used as a carry on), and Samsonite refused to fix it. They claimed we abused the luggage. We will NEVER purchase Samsonite again, I refuse to support companies who don't stand behind their products.Upside * The smoothest rolling I have ever felt - the magnetic wheels help you luggage glide gracefully and straight across ay path * LIFETIME Warranty!! (this applies even if it's the airline's fault) - note warranty policies change, it was lifetime for me, but triple check before you purchase * Zippers are smooth as SILK! * Great construction quality, I don't expect this to ever break * The handle is solid, yet not too large, and travels up and down the side of the suitcase very easily * Lots of various compartments that are thoughtfully placed * Option to use your own power bank if you choose to * Lots of room inside to pack various items - space is not wasted with this bag! * Waterproof toiletry bag that you can remove if you want to save space * Integrated garment bag to help keep clothes wrinkle free; you can remove if you want to save spaceDownside * Cost - this will cost more than a lot of luggage you see out there; on the order of 2x - 4x what you may pay for something else * While this is technically the legal carry one size, I've seen people take larger bags onto airplanes (I find this rude and annoying as they take up all the overhead space, but don't get me started)Save yourself the headache of broken luggage. Get this bag and you will not regret it!",

The wheels are still rolling smoothly despite enduring medieval cobblestone streets (I really thought they'd break, but no).I got the Platinum Elite 25 from Amazon Warehouse Deals at less than half the listed price! Except for a very slight scratch on the top leather handle, it was in pristine condition, and I was also able to register the product online without problem.Despite some reviews I read online, the front metal zipper was working fine. I still lubricated it with graphite powder and wax paper to prevent breakage and it glides very well now.The spinner wheels roll smoothly, the handle feels sturdy in hand, and the luggage is easy to maneuver.The expansion feature doesn't really add volume to the luggage, I think it only serves the purpose of being able to use the optional clothes hanger.I probably won't use the provided plastic toiletry bag but it's nice to have the option to unzip it off.",
