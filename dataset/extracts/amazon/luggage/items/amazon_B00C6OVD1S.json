                "reviewText": "For the Rockland 2-piece luggage set: I was looking for a small carry-on bag, and the small bag in this 2-piece set is just the right size. I have other small carry-on bags, but the one I use most is much heavier and sometimes it's really too large. This small one is perfect. Note that it does not have wheels.In the 2-piece set, the \"larger\" bag is 19 inches, as stated, which is still pretty small. It has two inline-skate type wheels (not spinners). This is also the size I wanted for short trips. In contrast, I already have a couple of 22 inch pieces of luggage, but they are too much sometimes. These two bags are both very light. The small bag will make a great carry-on for short flights, and it should also be great for car trips, camping, etc.The price for these two pieces is great. The zippers seem to work fine, with good quality. However, the cheap, flimsy lock that came with the 19\" bag is useless -- it looks like it will open with a sneeze, and the key is cut out of very thin metal. I discarded this lock and the keys. If you really want to lock your luggage, you need to use a TSA-approved lock anyway, (at least in the U.S.), so you shouldn't use this lock on a flight.There are lots of color choices. Getting something other than black will help your bags stand out from all the others. I can't comment on the other pieces that come in the 4-piece set, but I am happy with what I received. It should be great for my short upcoming trip.",

The cost was low and they were available overnight--just what I needed, but didn't expect much (I actually told my sister that I expected to throw them away after the trip, lol). I packed the suitcase within an inch of its zipper life, lol. It looked pregnant. The bag expands, but still. It fit into the overhead compartment with no problem, and the smaller bag slid right under the seat. The side pouches allow easy access for chargers, etc. Gifts were given during the trip and I was even selected for extra screening--the bag closed with no problem. I truly expected the zippers to burst.I took one star off for maneuverability, because the sole set of wheels did not make it easy, it kind of wobbled. While part of that is my fault, since I packed it to the brim; it did expand to allow me to do this, so the wheels could support it a little better.I would definitely buy again and even give as a gift.",

I bought a \"like new\" bag at a reduced price. It has a little more wear on the wheels and near them than it should have for a \"like new\" bag. But the rest is fine. A lot of stuff fits in this little bag. I packed it with things I normally take and everything fit comfortably. The bag stood up fine by itself and did not tip over. I packed 4 pairs of quick dry capri pants; 3 pairs shorts; snorkel and mask; 4 tees; 1 long sleeve shirt; swim pants; swim shoes; slip on sneakers; sport sandals; extra sport back pack; hat; extra soft bag and it closed without expanding it. The smaller bag is very cute but too small to use as my purse since I don't check bags. Still cute. No key for the lock which I don't understand the purpose of the lock anyway. The zippers seem sturdy. I love owls and had to have this. Perfect for carry on - don't know about checking it. It is perfect for what I want and need for travel.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the owl pattern for my 5 year old and the giraffe pattern for my 11 year old for a trip to grandma's this coming summer. After arrival, I inspected the pieces thoroughly and found them to be well made. The goal is to take only a carry-on and a personal bag each so we don't have to pay extra luggage fees. I did a pre-packing run to make sure how much we could fit inside and I was very happy.... So happy in fact, that I decided to order a set for myself too. I pack by laying out my pants and shirts on top of each other, folding them in half, and rolling them together. I find that I fit far more in my bag that way. Here is what I fit inside the main area for myself without expanding the zipper for the extra 2 inches of room:2 pairs of jeans3 pair of mid calf capri pants5 shirts1 dress3 bras5 underwear1 pair sandals1 pair dress flats1 pair Nike running shoes1 swimming suit1 beach cover-upIn the small outer pockets I packed:5 pair socks3 camis1 slipIn the smaller personal bag, I fit my 11 inch laptop in the large front pocket. In the main area, I fit the following:make-up, curling iron, deodorant, toothpaste, electric toothbrush with its charger, phone and charger, travel size wet wipes and Kleenex packets, wallet, keys, snacks and a water bottle.There is a zippered long narrow pocket on the other side of the personal bag that is the perfect size in which to put your boarding pass. There is also a nice wide strap to loop over the handle of the carry-on so both bags can be pull transported through the airport.I rolled the bags all around my house on carpet and hardwood to test the wheels. They functioned smoothly. I parked the bag free standing and fully packed. It remained upright. Some reviewers have said their bags tipped over when packed. Maybe it depends on what you have inside and how it is packed.I fly Delta and the fee for checked bags is $25 each way so a round trip would cost $50. You are allowed one carry-on and a personal item for free. I paid $29 for the owl print set, $35 for the giraffe print set, and $29 for the solid purple set I bought for myself. I know these will last many trips for my girls and I so it was definately worth the pittance of a price for these new luggage sets. I come out $1 cheaper after tax and with my free prime shipping ordering all of these than I would have to check 2 bigger bags. I packed enough clothes for each of us for a week. I actually could fit two weeks worth of clothes for my 5 year old since her things are smaller. We are staying 3 weeks at grandma's house so we do laundrythere. I'd much rather have the pretty new luggage for the price than to pack extra clothes and pay for the bag fee. The way I figure it, even if we buy extra stuff there that won't fit on the way back, it's cheaper to mail it back in a priority mail one rate box than to pay luggage fees. I am very happy with my purchase and think you will be as well.",
