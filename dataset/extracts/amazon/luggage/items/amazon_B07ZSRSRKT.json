                "reviewText": "I'm IN LOVE with this carry-on, marble suitcase! It's my first hardshell. It's smooth, lightweight, beautiful interior and roomy. The handle is asjustable; the suitcase rolls smoothly. Some reviews have mentioned that the extendable handles create 'ridges' on one side of the interior; while this is true,I've never NOT had handles create ridges on the interior. I use the 'slight' ridges to my advantage and lay my socks/undergarments/straightening iron, etc. to ' fill in the ridges' to create a flat base for my pants. I use the 'unridged' side for my shirts, etc. It has a tiny wet bag that will hold a few items.While I have not yet traveled with the suitcase, I can't speak to It's durability, however, if it doesn't stand up to the rigors of travel, I'll update this review. If there's no update from me, this translates as 'no news is good news.'Ps. I have a smaller personal item lack bag with a shoe department (that will strap/affix to the handles) for my toiletries, shoes, etc.; an eye-catching, winning combo! Don't hesitate to buy this carry-on! It's gorgeous!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first venture into the hard-side luggage world and I'm glad I went this route. Interior design wise, this is superior to soft-side luggage of the same type.What I like: It's light, offers a good amount of space inside, has perfectly placed straps on one side and a zipper closure for shoes, etc. on the other side. It does have a small zipper pocket on the bottom of the one side but it's not very deep so it's really only suited for things like a to-go pack of tissues, cuff-links, things like that.What I don't like: You get what you pay for... or should I say you don't get what you don't pay for? Yes, this has 4 wheels and will spin around, but try something at a higher price point like Away's The Carry-on and you'll instantly feel the difference. These wheels feel like they're out of balance and don't quite roll the direction you want them to. Again, they work, just not as nicely as I would have liked. The pull handle feels flimsy and is a pain to get in the right spot. I have to constantly adjust it after pulling the handle out because it fails to lock into place at the right height. I also wouldn't throw your backpack over the handle to rest on the luggage while you wheel it around either. I really don't trust the long-term durability of it if you're going to do that. Again, it works, it just leaves a lot to be desired for my standards. Given the choice of materials for this, I also question how long it will hold up. Yes, as long as it is actually used as carry-on, it should hold up fine. But for those times when the overhead bins are full and you now have to check it at the gate, I do question if it'll last for years.At this point it has held up well through the 6 flights I've taken it on thus far so I can't knock it too much. I was being cheap and should have spent more money for something nicer. If you get this for under $100 I think it's a solid deal.",
