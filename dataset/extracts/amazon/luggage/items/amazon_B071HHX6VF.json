I used it for the items like shoes, books, purses, etc. that didn\u2019t fit into my checked suitcase. On the way home, I had plenty of extra space for purchases I made during my vacation. The zippers are high quality and seem unlikely to break. It\u2019s easy to roll through the airport, but like other reviewers, I found the handle flimsy and cheap, which is a shame because the body is durable. Given the great price, I wouldn\u2019t expect perfection. 4 stars because of handle.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE BELOW.....Wow. These suitcases are AWESOME for the price! I was expecting a lot less. I purchased 3. I chose the bright, safety orange. Easy to see in the sea of other colors for sure. The outer shell is hard - sturdy feeling. The inside is roomy. They are around 5-6\" deep in each side (I've included some pics - sorry about holding the ruler upside down - but you can see it's about 5 to 6\") One side is zipper closed, the other side has elastic straps to contain contents. The outer zippers are sturdy feeling and run smoothly. There is also an 'extender' zipper giving you an extra 2\" or so in depth. Honestly, these suitcases 'feel' as nice as some others I have purchased for literally 4x the price! All the nice care points too with the inner zipper, and additional pockets. It looks and feels like a suitcase way beyond the price point. Now, in all fairness, they are new to me and I will be using them on a trip in about a week. So, I will update my review should new info seem useful. The ad says they weigh just under 10lbs.. I used my handheld suitcase scale and it registered 9.1 lbs empty. One of the pics I included shows me holding a 12\" ruler so you can get an idea of the width of the inside of the cases. The pull out handle is not as 'sturdy' feeling as I would like... but it works- It locks down and lifts easily. It appears or feels like the pullout handle is plastic at the handle part.. the bar appears to be lightweight aluminum - so it might be bent with lots of use.. we'll see. There are two grab handles one on the top and one the side of case. The outer wheels are multi-directional... and stick out quite a bit and I'm not sure they are as 'sturdy' as the rest of the case. If there is an 'Achilles heel' on these bags... the wheels may be it or possibly the pull handle.. but we as I said, time will tell and I never hesitate to update. I've included some pics and hope my review was helpful to you.UPDATE: 12/4/2019.... Have taken these suitcases through the airline system two times so far... NO problems to report. I am happier and happier with this purchase... but time will tell and I update if new info seem useful.",

                "reviewText": "I had used this on a recent trip to Japan and Korea and Hong Kong; and quite satisfy with it. It has almost all functionality and features as other carry on but more than half the price. The outer shell plastic is actually quite durable; after the Asia trip, I can only identify a small scratch on one of the upper corner. Otherwise, it holds up very well, no dent, no unsightly scratches. And the double wheels still move very smoothly. The telescopic handle works very well without issue. The 2 handles are very useful (one top handle and one side handle which helps greatly while lifting up to the overhead bin). The inside is spacious and really love the expandable feature (which can accommodate the many clothing I bought during the trip...). Overall, it's a great value for the money; you won't be disappointed. Just as all the commercials you'd seen : Why pay more for the same thing.... Yes, it's true. I compared to many similar carry on before I bought this one. Many other that are double the price or more, doesn't have all the features this Amazon one has; except that this one doesn't look as attractive as the other more expensive ones.; but value and quality and durability and usability for the money, you can't beat that.... Highly Recommended.",
