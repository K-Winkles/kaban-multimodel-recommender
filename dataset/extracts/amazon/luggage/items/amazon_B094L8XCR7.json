                "reviewText": "I got this because my normal suitcase, that has lasted me for years, had an issue with the handle not retracting easily (the mechanism inside the slide was broken), and I didn't want to have to screw around with it at the airport. I didn't feel like paying 500$ for a new one (mistake #1), so based on the high review score, I went with this one because it was one of the only ones that would be delivered in time for a trip I was making.The luggage is your average super basic design, very little padding on the inside, standard zipper, handles, and wheels. To it's credit, the wheels feel smooth when rolling and the handle retracts/extends easily. That's why it got 1 star (also because you can't leave zero stars)Now for the bad. I've had this for less than a year, and on 5 separate occasions, it has split open. three of the times it has split when coming off the luggage conveyor at my destination, forcing me to have to repack it on the spot. Once it split while Just rolling it (literally just dumped everything on on the ground) and Once it split somewhere between the airplane and the cart, forcing Southwest's baggage handlers to deliver it to the oversize cargo area. The zipper on this suitcase is an absolute POS (piece of...), and for that reason, I CANNOT recommend this to anyone.Yes, I don't overpack it (the weight when scanned at the airport is 40-45lbs always), yes, I ensure BOTH zippers are fully closed, etc. It's just crap zipper system. The only way you can guarantee this thing does not split is to either wrap it in plastic wrap, or get a belt or something that goes around it to keep it sealed (or maybe duct tape it shut). That's the only way I can see you guaranteeing this thing doesn't split open somewhere between when you give it to the Agents , the Plane and then back to you at the destination. DO NOT BUY.",

Tons of space inside including some hidden areas as well. Wheels work good and it\u2019s easy to move. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 of these for an international flight to visit family in a remote area. I have to bring gifts and things to sustain my own living (bedding, chairs, food for 3-5 days travel incase I was stuck somewhere that didn\u2019t have food). Bags were packed at under 50lbs for US regulations.Loved how lightweight the suitcases were!ConsHard shell isn\u2019t hard. Very lightweight and flimsy. One suitcase after 1st US flight had a corner caved in severely. Total of 7 different airplanes before destination. I am 4 flights in and the handle appears it might break but they are still rolling on and zipper is holding up. The other suitcase has already torn on the inside where you can zip the flap to hold your clothes in one side. Not sure which flight that happened on because I am living out of a book-bag. I only opened to check contents security. I imagine before I reach my final destination it will be ripped so much it\u2019s only one big compartment, which will make difficult to shut. I do not need to bring the suitcases back with me so what is happening is fine but if you are thinking you are going to have a lifetime suitcase for $89 think again. They were perfect for my one time use but nothing else.",
