The zipper opener and closed without issue. When the bag was fully weighed down it struggled a little but nothing major. For $100 it's not bad but for this price I wish they made it expandable!",

                "reviewText": "The BAGSMART airline approved carry-on bag is excellent in just about every way. It is a great looking bag and well designed, with really nice features. The bag has a built-in telescoping handle that locks at various heights to accommodate anyone no matter how tall. The spinners are super smooth and the perfect size, they roll without almost any resistance at all. It also has a TSA lock that can be opened either by a TSA key or combination code. Inside, the bag has everything you need to keep the contents secure and packed tight. Straps, zippered pockets, zippered compartment dividers, etc., and it is also expandable by almost two inches as well. There are built-in soft handles on the top as well as the side to provide convenient pick up and carry options too. This is the best hard-shell carry-on that I have owned and recommend it. Awesome bag!",

The hard side feels slightly thin on the front and back, so I have a feeling it will get dented up at the airport. The wheels are quite average too. They are pretty smooth when moving, but they get caught slightly when changing direction. Still, for the price I can recommend this suitcase.",
