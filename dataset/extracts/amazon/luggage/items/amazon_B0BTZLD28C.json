This time I needed a carry-on and I really liked this one as it has all the features the competitor models do not, like a side handle and an expander. I didn't even think of how important those features were until I started researching other bags.It's a \"carry-on\" bag, so clearly you are going to have to hoist it into an overheard compartment- I'm a small woman so that would be infinitely more difficult without a side handle. Also this carry-on will actually fit most European size requirements, which most other North American \"carry-ons\" would not.Most other good competitors (like Samsonite) only had either the handle or the expander on their comparable models, but not both.",

I suspect the seller is using images of a larger suitcase and trying to pass this one off as offering more than it does. It is quite spacious inside and the extension is nice.",
