                "reviewText": "My daughters and I were headed to NYC when I purchased this set for my 16-year-old. She is a huge fan of pink, so this set was made for her! :-) She already had soct sides suitcases, but they had been put through the wringer on flights, so we wanted to update with a hard shell luggage set. The cases arrived and were very nice, plenty of space and so many in the set for the price, it was great! She adored them!! Unfortunately , on our return flight home, the zipper did not hold up on the medium sized case. She only had a minimal amount in the case, so there was no reason for this to happen. When we arrived at the baggage claim, her suitcase was open with the contents spilling out on the carousel. Needless to say I was VERYupset! As soon as we arrived home I contacted Amazon to let them know. I shipped back the defective set and had a replacement within just a few days. They replaced the entire set. I really was impressed with the quick return. She had her new set, which has held up great so far, for our next trip. I had to give 4 stores because of the defective case, but she still loves set!",

I literally saves these to use on our cruise I wish I would have used sooner before this big trip and now It might be too late to get these returned.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this luggage set and mainly bought it for the carry-on size which I use the most. I thought I would be getting more space vs my current piece. This set sold by Leaves King is labeled Larvender and when doing a side by size comparison (with my current hard side piece), this piece sits up a bit higher which cuts into the usable space. It also does not expand which my old set does and I like that in case I happen to need that feature. Since I usually travel only with carry-on and can be on trips that last a few weeks and want to minimize what I am hauling around, I am looking for a piece that gives me the maximum usable space for what my usual airlines allow.",
