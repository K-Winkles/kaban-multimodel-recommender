                "reviewText": "It fits my 62 inch Samsonite Sphere luggage too short. The velcro at the bottom does NOT make me feel secure so I wrap it round and round with Mueller EZ-Wrap Plastic Film w/Handle - Each (4 in X 1000 ft roll) sold here on Amazon.com. Otherwise I will use what has worked in the past: Saran Wrap and mailing tape.Wrap it sideways and up and down. Google OPEN LUGGAGE PEN and see how the luggage thieves around the world break into your luggage. Might add another layer of security by making a thin steel cable from Home Depot and making two loops at the ends. String through all your clothes and lock it with a NON-TSA lock and then throw the bundle into your luggage. Take all other items and put them into ziplock bags of all sizes and STAPLE them before you TAPE them shut. I never carry my cash, computer, cameras, or other valuables in Check-In. NEVER EVER bring your fancy rings or wedding rings and such on your vacations. Always carry traveler's checks and a few dollar bills you can afford to lose. I try NEVER to use my credit cards even though I carry them with me. There have been stories where a crooked store or hotel will take your card away to another room to ring up a sale. Later on you discover they made a second LARGER charge which you will discover after you get home and receive the credit card bill. Always carry them in my carry-on even if I have to carry two more backpacks. The airlines don't say anything.",
