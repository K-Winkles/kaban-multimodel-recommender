Don\u2019t know about air travel and their rough handling of your bags.Nice thick and durable outside material that is attractive. Inside is basic but easy to use when packing with cubes. The 2 tie downs keep you organized and in place.The only thing that could improve performance is flat fabric handles to grab on all sides. But, as designed, certainly ok.The stacking is great but you definitely lose real estate inside as you step down in sizes.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For me it would be that they are extremely lightweight and have lovely wheels that move very easily. I love the carry-on luggage and that it\u2019s lightweight so possibly I can load it or get someone to help me load it in the overhead compartment. I need The small one to carry on the plane with me as I will have to take my CPAP machine and my portable oxygen machine with me and I feel better that The small bag will qualify as a carry-on. Very important my machines don\u2019t get thrown around. I will put in some towels to wrap my machines in my carry-on luggage just for extra protection. I purchased the one made of Very durable materials as the reviews said it was very durable and again I needed light weight luggage for me too manage easily. My favorite color in the whole world is purple and this was an absolute beautiful purple so I am quite pleased with that. The handles are easy retractable and The metal handles that you pull out to roll your luggage around the airport is adjustable with different heights. The handles on the side and the top of the luggage I would assume would really make it very easy for you to place on your bed to pack your clothes in the same thing for unpacking once you get to your destination. I also assume it will make for easy lifting to put above your head on the plane for safe storage .I will have to give you all an update on my experience with my luggage during my vacation. I knew nothing about purchasing luggage and it took a certain size to qualify as a carry-on. I purchased this luggage due to most positive reviews and even if they came a little damaged or damaged during their trip, I understood that the customer said the company which is Coolife read the reviews and reached out to the customer to make sure they could resolve any issues the customer had with their luggage. I will say so far I am very pleased that I decided to choose this brand of luggage. I hope my video presentation of my luggage helps anyone looking for quality luggage at a very reasonable price will be able to make a very informed decision before purchasing another brand.Sincerely, BrandyPurple \ud83d\udc9c",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait until I actually used this luggage for a trip, which I did recently. Here are a couple of things I realized while using this luggage for travel. The suitcases seem pretty sturdy and the spinner wheels work well (hopefully they last a while). I know the dimensions are clear in the product description, but wanted to confirm that only the smallest suitcase is considered a carry-on. I like the size of the medium suitcase but it is too big for a carry-on. Also the smallest suitcase does not have a side handle, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver into the overhead compartment. I also didn't realize when I bought this set that they are not expandable, which would have been a plus. But all in all, a decent set for the price. Hope to use them for a long time!",
