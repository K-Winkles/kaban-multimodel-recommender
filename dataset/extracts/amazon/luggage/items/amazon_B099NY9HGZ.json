I remember opening it and thinking \"uh oh. This might not work.\" But I managed to fit 2 pairs of shoes (including a pair of heavy clogs), 1 pair of jeans, 2 pairs of leggings, a pair of scrubs, 1 pair of sweatpants, 2 sweatshirts, 7 lighter shirts, underwear, socks, a hard-sided water bottle and my rather large toiletry bag. Oh! And a couple of flat books. I travel for work, and try to avoid using the washer/dryer in the hotel if I can. This suitcase is meeting my needs. Love it! If something falls apart quickly, I'll update, but so far it seems well built. So glad I ditched my heavier carry on.",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely in love with this luggage. When it was delivered I was super excited. The color was amazing. They ease of the way it rolled was exciting and I was pleasantly surprised that it had locks on it as well so no one could get into your luggage. Also, doubly exciting, you can purchase a power bank to use with the luggage so you always have a charger with you, especially at airports that don't have built in outlets in their seats (who does that anymore?).Anyway, took my first trip with this luggage a few weeks ago and this luggage wins hands down over any other luggage I've ever had in my life. At first I was a little skeptical about how much I'd be able to fit in it compared to past luggage. It didn't seem to have as much room. Much to my surprise, I was able to fit a week's worth of clothes, toiletries AND 3 pairs of shoes in this suitcase and not have to unzip the expander. I could've easily gotten more inside with the zipper expanded.Once we got to the airport was my real test. My right hand is usually aching by the time we get to our gate because of the amount of pressure I need to use to roll the bag and keep it on course. With this bag, I could've maneuvered it with one finger. It so easily rolled alongside me and even rolled without me even touching it. The handle has several adjustable heights so my husband who is 6'2\" is able to have it at a comfortable level but so am I at 5'1\". This luggage is amazing. The price may seem steep but it is well worth it!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first large Travelpro, purchased to replace a hard-shell large suitcase which finally died because a handle broke making it a bear to lift. This suitcase is fantastic. My previous 2 Travelpro are both overhead carry-on types....a soft side 2-wheel and a hard shell 4-wheel which is very similar in design to this unit, just smaller. I have both those Travelpro's in rotation, use them often, and love them. Once I got the 4-wheel carryon, I have to admit it is pretty cool versus the 2 wheel drag-behind. I am a convert.Anyway, this large Travelpro is a great suitcase. We wanted large volume, hard side, easy maneuvering. Well, this thing has a huge amount of space and it is amusing how far it rolls with barely a push. I have traveled with multiple motorcycle helmets and jackets in it, no problem. My daughter and I used it for ski/snowboard gear (boots, helmets)....any big awkward stuff which didn't easily fit into our ski bag roller. Through poor planning (my fault) we ended up in Denver Airport for 6 hours before we could check bags. We ended up setting the ski bag (heavy with skis, snowboard, boots, etc.) on top of this case.....like the Travelpro was a luggage cart. It worked fantastic, rolling smoothly with the extra weight. It made the 6hr roaming the airport a little easier. Thank you Travelpro.We have had this large case on I think 8 RT flights so far, so 16 flights? It is holding up great and continues to roll well and it looks good, too. Very happy with the purchase, another Travelpro winner.",

                "reviewText": "Keeping the entire original review below for reference but with the following update:The wheels on this carry on are uncredible. I dont\u2019 understand how they can be so smooth and quiet. There is no rollling resistance at all. It moves with no effort whatsoever.The handle? Not an issue. Works well. I especially like the height adjustment levels. Better than other carry ons. A nice touch.It is a bit smaller than my other carry on. The extender increases the overall size but the zippered compartments themselves can\u2019t be expanded.Overall. I love this carry on. Will likely buy the next size up too.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Original review:The magnetic wheels are a nice touch and make it very easy to maneuver the carry on. The wheels are also incredibly smooth and quiet.The case itself is solid and I really like the matte finish. It reduces the visual appearance of inevitable scratches and dings.The case is very light. I liked that. I travel alot and saving some weight on the case helps.My only concern is around the handles. They are rubber/plastic and the mechanism for attaching them to the case itself don\u2019t look particularly solid. The handles on my existing carry ons (I have two) are made of nylon/heavy duty fabric and they have been solid even though I have had them for over 15 years. I am not sure the handles on this Travelpro carry on will last that long.The warranty is excellent but it won\u2019t help you if the handle breaks when you are 3000 miles from home.Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to update the review in a year.",
