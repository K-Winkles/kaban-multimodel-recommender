It\u2019s sliiightly bigger than a typical carryon suitcase but fits perfectly in the overhead bin and had no issue from anyone on Delta Airlines when I used it. I like the hard shell because I ended up needing to check my bag on the way back and felt confident that my things inside were protected enough to be put under the plane! The wheels work flawlessly and the design is so cute. The only con to the suitcase is that the handle is loose and doesn\u2019t click every time in the middle.",
