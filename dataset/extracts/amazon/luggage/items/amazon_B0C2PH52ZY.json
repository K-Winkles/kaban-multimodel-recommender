I used a budget airline and the size of these bags were perfect for the overhead and under seat areas. The rolling was smooth and easy through parking lots, airports, subway stations, etc. They were roomy and I had plenty of space for what I brought with room left to bring home some souvenirs. I also love the color! Since it's only been one trip, I can't speak for durability or how the bag would do if it was checked, but they seem pretty sturdy. I'm looking forward to using these a lot in the future!",

Although, I haven\u2019t used it yet, the spinner wheels seem awesome and it seems like a functional set for carryon travel. I like the lock feature and the ease of the personal bag fitting on the handle for easy rolling. It seems sturdy and durable, but it has not been put through real life testing yet. Very disappointed it doesn\u2019t have a handle on the bottom for lifting the bag on to a luggage rack or putting in a trunk. This was a feature I used every time on my former carryon. It doesn\u2019t seem as well made as my Samsonite, but it is much lighter weight when empty too. Great colors, ready to try it out!",

                "reviewText": "Bagsmart carryon is couple inches shorter in length and height compared to Kenneth Cole reaction carryon in the picture. Kenneth Cole reaction is expensive to me over $200 only because you\u2019re paying for the brand name but it does give you couple more inches and the build quality is beautiful in 2 tone colors with black & gold outline and the gold zippers are solid. So I decided to keep Kenneth Cole reaction but I haven\u2019t finished packing yet with the shared carry on between myself and my husband for our future 3 weeks Philippines trip. It\u2019s humid and hot over there all year long. But I\u2019m still not completely confident yet if both brands can hold 3 weeks worth of clothes for international trips but I want to stack as much as I can and avoid checking in too many luggages as much as possible. I returned the bagsmart brand.",
