                "reviewText": "I purchased this on January 8, 2022. Since then I have done a bit of traveling. The handles on this set are very flimsy and they stick when you try to put them pack down. Also the wheels are not sturdy. the wheels on the large suitcase are bent after only about 3 uses. The good things I can say are the large suitcase has a ton of room. They are also very attractive and I get a ton of compliments. However, I would never purchase these again. I just purchased a set of Samsonite - spent less and got way better quality.",

The only confusing thing that was more on us than anything is that the labeling makes it seem like it should be a 5 piece set when there are only four. Looks great otherwise.",
