When my child said it wasn't a vacation with out a rolling suitcase and backpacks were just carrying your junk from place to place, I gave in and got her this bag. I fully expect I was going to be balancing it on my head as we traveled though 9 countries in under 3 weeks on and off trains, planes and long walks across cobble roads. To my surprise this was the little bag that could. We stacked backpacks food bags and weighed down this little wheelie case and it just kept on going. Much to my surprise this bag held up to heavy abuse we put it though and is ready to keep traveling. Also unique design made it easy to pick out of all the other bags when checked it easily fit on the planes and into the overhead bins of even the tiny planes.",

It\u2019s super light weight so it won\u2019t add to weight.Wish it was expandable but it\u2019s still gots lots of room.Only real negative is the protective plastic film they put on it for shipping \u2026 ugh you can\u2019t get it all off!! It\u2019s stuck on in The handle and along the edges and where the wheels are attached. You\u2019ll need to take tweezers and pick at removing all the plastic to try and remove.But so far super great carry on.Wheels roll through parking garage with ease. Even over the bumps and divots in the garage. Goes over bumps and carpet easily and just keeps rolling. Very easy to push through isle of airplane too.Highly recommend. Will be buying another.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Defective, returned merchandise resold as new -- DO NOT BUY",
                "reviewText": "We bought 2 of these suitcases for our kids (ages 6 and 8) for Christmas; we chose this model because it is lightweight, has spinner wheels, has distinctive patterned exteriors that our kids think is fun, is still of a decent size, and has multiple handle positions that can adjust to be easily pulled by both kids and adults. When we opened the first suitcase, we found that the manufacturers tag was not attached and was simply lying loose in the box. We also noticed that the plastic protective coating that is supposed to be removed after purchase was already removed in all but a few places. When we opened the case, we found that one of the straps that are supposed to hold the clothes in the side of the case was not properly attached (this strap is critical because the suitcase is a 'clamshell' style, opening in the middle with 2 equal halves to fill with clothes rather than opening on an end -- without the strap, the clothes simply fall out when the suitcase is opened). Clearly this case had been purchased by someone else, returned as defective, and simply put back in a box and resold as new. We then opened the second suitcase; it had the plastic protective coating half-removed and one of the manufacturers' tags removed and lying loose in the box. When we tried to use the suitcase, we found that the handle was loose and wiggly, and would not lock in the lower position, which is exactly the position needed to pull the suitcase by an 8-year old. Thus, out of 2 suitcases with different patterns, both had been returned as defective and resold as new. Thus, both of these suitcases are being returned -- again. This is too bad: the rest of the suitcase seems to be of excellent construction and would have fit the bill perfectly. It's a shame that this sleazy retailer elected to resell defective merchandise as new, ruining what otherwise would have been a good product and a good purchasing experience.",
