                "reviewText": "I've been through so many cheaper cases, each time trying to convince myself that this one is going to be, well, maybe not quite as good as a B&R but close enough. I was wrong. Sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the quality. The lifetime guarantee is also a big plus. Plusses - the flat internal base (telescopic handle is on the outside) makes it really easy to pack and stops clothes from scrunching up; wheels are really smooth and solid - walked around Boston for a day with it without any issues; it looks smart and modern, unlike some of the other B&R bags; zips are strong; each pocket is really well thought through and serves its purpose. Negatives - besides the price, none. And besides black, the other colours are old fashioned. There's no lock on it (although you can add a padlock) which I thought would be an issue but actually it's always with me, so not really a problem. It expands by 3 cms all the way round which does add a surprising amount of capacity. Better than Samsonite, not as blingy as a Tumi, more understated than Rimowa. Just the best bags you can buy.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a long time investigating a new suitcase. I've had a two wheeler for years, and I was leery of a four wheeler. The four wheeler works okay. One problem is that the briefcase I hang from the strap is probably a bit too long, and unless you carefully cinch it up, it can drag on the ground. But this suitcase works just fine as a two wheeler, so it's easy to adapt when necessary.As for the external strap, it is not permanently attached so it can come off more easily than I would like. My response is that I just never leave it on the bag when it is out of my possession. When I remove my briefcase, I take the strap too. This works fine.I would be happier with the bag if it had a few internal pockets along one of the sides. I'd also be happier if I could remove the internal strap on the bottom of the bag. I don't really have a use for it, but it does hold things down very well.Generally, however, I'm happy enough with the bag. I just used it on a two week international trip, and the bag presented no difficulties. The bag is a bit pricey, but it is well made.",

Well, this is by far the best work suitcase I have owned. It glides so smooth through the airport and on sidewalks. Even fully packed, it is light, which is so important to me. My shoulders usually hurt from pushing, pulling, and lifting my bag all the time. I look at this as an investment in making my life easier. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate. You won't regret it.",

But since I travel internationally for a living, and I've decided to make the shift and solely travel with a carry-on, finally- I went for it, and I'm so glad I did. Great suitcase. Handles well and comfortably. I love that the extra room zipper goes across the middle rather than adding a couple of inches to one side of the bag as other suitcases do.And my favorite is that the bars for the handle are on the outside, so they don't take up space on the inside. This makes a big difference when you're packing for longer trips.",
