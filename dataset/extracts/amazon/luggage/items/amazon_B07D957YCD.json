I can say for sure that the plastic did not go under the hardware or wheels on any of the three suitcases that came in this set. I was pleasantly surprised that it took me less than 5 minutes to completely remove all of the film.When I first purchased, the largest suitcase was crushed on one corner. I processed the return, and it took less than 2 days to receive my replacement in perfect condition. I have not used the luggage yet, but I am very excited to. It is a more candy apple red than the pictures would leave you to believe, but personally I think this color is even better than the wine red.",

                "reviewText": "I chose these because the reviews were pretty good and it was a nice looking set. Unfortunately the plastic coating ruins the looks because you can't get it off of all areas. I spent hours with tweezers trying to remove it. I also used an old credit card as a scraper which helped a little but I wrecked my nails AND my tweezers and still can't get it all off. Don't have much confidence that they will stay shiny if they had to be covered like that just for shipping.The case seems like flimsy plastic as are the handles, the zippers don't zip very smoothly; and it is NOT expandable as the description says. They aren't roomy, I filled the largest with quilts etc. just to test the wheels, it was packed full and only weighed 29 pounds. The one good thing I can say is that the wheels did move easily with that weight, although I wonder how they will do with heavier items. This was NOT what we were expecting as we thought Rockland was a good and dependable brand. I'm concerned on how these will hold up going through airlines, guess we'll be bringing duct tape along on our next trip for emergency fixes. Don't recommend these at all.",
