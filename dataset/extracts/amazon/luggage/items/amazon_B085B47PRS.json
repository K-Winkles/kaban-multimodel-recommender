We are very happy with the luggage, but had an issue where two of the bags had tears near the seams after marginal use. We contacted the manufacturer and followed their process. They were very responsive, answering each query within 1-2 business days. In the end, they agreed to replace the bags for us. We have received the new bags, but have not yet traveled with them. We are traveling later this year and hoping they hold up well. I have no problem giving U.S. Traveler a 5-star rating as they did not hassle us about the damage. These bags are light, which is something important to us since we fly a lot and every pound of weight is important. The 3-bag set works nicely.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I knew this was inexpensive luggage but needed it in a bind when I realized the luggage I had wasn\u2019t the right specs for international flight. Considering what the price STILL was I expected it to at least get me to my destination and then the hotel, but I was very wrong!!! Didn\u2019t even withstand the airport and the a train station. In the larger case Everything falls to the bottom of the suitcase in an upright position which causes collapse at other points of the case making it impossible to strap the smaller one to the top without it falling off every 100 yards. Two wheels bent off the base and the other wheel completely fell apart on the cobblestone sidewalk of the city I traveled to. I had to drag the luggage to my hotel room. I am very disappointed!!! There are only two inner straps that don\u2019t hold anything inside down. I cannot return it because I am on an international trip. Going to throw it in the trash. I had to buy a new one locally just so I can get my belongings home. DO NOT ignore the reviews. This might work for you if you are traveling locally in a car and maneuvering minimally on any surface. Complete waste of money. JUNK!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the U.S. Traveler Aviron Bay Expandable Softside Luggage with Spinner Wheels in Purple, specifically the 30-inch variant, for my upcoming trip. Having used it extensively, I can provide an honest and thorough review of this product. While it offers several commendable features, there are a few areas that could use improvement.First and foremost, the expandable feature of this luggage is truly impressive. It provides ample space for packing, allowing me to fit in all my essentials and even some extra items. The added flexibility comes in handy, especially when returning with souvenirs and gifts. The zippers are smooth and durable, ensuring that the expansion doesn't compromise the integrity of the luggage. However, it is worth noting that when fully expanded, the luggage becomes bulkier and may exceed the size restrictions of some airlines.The spinner wheels on the Aviron Bay luggage are a game-changer. They glide effortlessly across various surfaces, including smooth airport floors and uneven pavements. Maneuvering through crowded terminals and narrow spaces is a breeze, thanks to the smooth and multidirectional spinner wheels. They provide excellent stability and prevent the luggage from tipping over, even when it is heavily loaded. The telescopic handle is sturdy and extends and retracts easily, adding to the overall convenience.One aspect that left me disappointed was the overall durability of the luggage. While it held up reasonably well during my travels, I noticed some signs of wear and tear, particularly on the corners and edges. The fabric seemed prone to fraying, and the stitching could be stronger. Considering the investment I made, I expected a higher level of durability. It would be beneficial for U.S. Traveler to address this issue and reinforce the luggage's construction to ensure it withstands the rigors of frequent travel.Another area where the Aviron Bay luggage fell short was in its organization and storage compartments. While the main compartment was spacious and could accommodate my belongings, I found the lack of smaller pockets and dividers inconvenient. It made it difficult to keep things organized, and I often had to rummage through my belongings to find specific items. Additional interior pockets or a removable divider would greatly enhance the functionality of this luggage, making it more user-friendly.One aspect I appreciated about the Aviron Bay luggage was its lightweight design. Despite the spacious interior, the luggage itself is relatively light, allowing me to maximize my packing without exceeding weight limits imposed by airlines. This was particularly advantageous during my return trip when I had accumulated more items. The lightweight nature of the luggage reduced strain on my arms and back, contributing to a more comfortable travel experience.The TSA-approved combination lock featured on the Aviron Bay luggage is a convenient security measure. It provides peace of mind knowing that my belongings are safe and protected during transit. The lock is easy to set and reset, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the contents. However, the lock mechanism itself feels somewhat flimsy, and I question its long-term durability. A sturdier lock mechanism would enhance the overall security aspect of this luggage.Lastly, I want to mention the aesthetic appeal of the Aviron Bay luggage. The purple color option I chose is vibrant and eye-catching, making it easy to spot on the baggage carousel. The overall design is sleek and modern, exuding a sense of sophistication. While appearance may not be the most crucial factor when it comes to luggage, it's always nice to have a visually appealing travel companion.In conclusion, the U.S. Traveler Aviron Bay Expandable Softside Luggage with Spinner Wheels in Purple is a mixed bag in terms of performance. Its expandable feature and smooth spinner wheels make it a reliable travel companion, allowing for easy maneuverability and efficient packing. However, there are areas that could use improvement, such as durability, organization, and the lock mechanism. If U.S. Traveler addresses these concerns, it has the potential to be an exceptional piece of luggage that caters to the needs of frequent travelers.",

                "reviewText": "I took this suitcase on a 2 week trip to Japan and it was very frustrating to deal with. The wheels do not swivel smoothly, so it's basically impossible to push in the direction you want when it is set on all 4 wheels. I had to drag it behind me using only 2 of the wheels. As you can see in the pictures it got pretty damaged. The telescoping handle also feels very flimsy. Towards the end of the trip one of the wheels gave out completely and I had to carry it. For the price I was quite disappointed.",
