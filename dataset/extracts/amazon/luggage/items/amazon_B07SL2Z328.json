I didn't have to mess with returning the defunct sets.I was excited when I received this set. I wanted to try a soft sided set as TSA has broken 3 hard sided suitcases over the past 3 years. I think the large one is defective as the top strap popped off but didn't break the metal hole that should have been securing it. It was also impossible to navigate as the front wheels aren't set right for proper mobility. The last picture is of one of the smaller ones to show how the wheels were installed differently than the largest suitcase.I've contacted the seller. If they can't resolve I will try to return, which will be a pain as I no longer have the box. Really hoping it is a fluke defect and not a design flaw since so many others gave good reviews.",

                "reviewText": "I was so happy to find this set. The price is great!! The look is beautiful. We packed it up for a lifelong dream trip. We loaded the large one to the max airline limit of 50lbs and the medium to 30 lbs. The Large and medium did not roll well at all even on a hardword floor. The handle broke on the large one that night. We had to scurry and repack into our old luggage last minute. We travelled for 3 weeks and by the time we got home the window for return on Amazon was closed. With some effort and a $30 fee and some time to contact Amazon we are able to recover $110.00 in the form of a gift card. We are happy with this as we understand rules of returns and the fact we could not and did not meet the criteria.In close, Im not sure if we just got a lemon. I do pay attention to the reviews and this product has very good reviews. I did see one other review of a broken handle though.",
