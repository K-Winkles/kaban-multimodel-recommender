I love that they're expandable as well!I've taken these suitcases on multiple trips and have had no issues with them at all. They roll extremely smoothly so I'm not able to move around more quickly without tiring my arms out. The personal bag conveniently latches onto the top of the suitcases as well! Setting the security code was very easy and the bag has stayed latched during each of my trips.The only downside I've encountered with this set is they scratch very easy while they're being handled in transit. I recommend getting a cover for your suitcase if you want to keep it looking nice. The top layer has already been scuffed off in a couple of areas on mine.",

I want the handle to be more sturdy as when heavier packing it seems to feel it\u2019s limit but I love the color and the extra bags that came making it easy to have a overhead and a carry-on. Also the travel bag for personals is cute to have. Best feature is that it expands which usually on a carry-on bag doesn't happen with all brands. Got many compliments on the set and color (Grey/camel) a wonderful combination that pops.I'm happy with this purchase.",
