                "reviewText": "I really liked this product and it seemed to be working well. After 4 months, I noticed my tongue looked yellow, which turned to orange. I went to the dr and was treated for thrush 3 times. They decided to send a scraping of it to the lab, and it was not thrush. A cause of orange tongue is too much beta-carotene. I quit taking the fruit capsules and the orange went away and my tongue went back to normal. The orange on my tongue made things taste weird, too. So, sadly, I am going to have to stop using these. :(",

I would have lots of days that I could hardly stay awake and get into what I called a blue funk where I didn't feel like doing anything. I decided to try a brand you see advertised along but they were very pricey so I searched Amazon for something I felt was compatible but less expensive. I found these and they are even organic and I really like that. It took about a week and I was feeling a little more energetic. Now I am amazed how much better I feel and more energy. I highly recommend this product!!",

                "reviewText": "For off let me clear up any confusion. This profile is my husbands but he has prime so I use it lol. Why pay twice. I am a women ^^. I hated mixing that bad tasting Metamucil drink every morning now I don't have too! Every women knows the importance of Metamucil after a certain age. it's tasteless my ass! It took two weeks and now I'm regular feel so much better. I take all 6 first thing in the morning, 3 of each. I have a bowl of cereal and a couple of cups of coffee. Then about an hour later I start getting ready for work and Yes that includes pooing lol. I don't feel weighed down, or the need to drink coffee all day to keep my energy up anymore. plus when I get home my feet don't feel like it would be less painful to just cut them off. Balance of Nature is so expensive that i put off trying it for a year even though everyone told me to try it. Then a friend how don't have cash falling out there butt like me turned me on to this. I tried it albeit I was a skeptic, it only took me two weeks and I have a believer. But I need to be brutally honest here. I am not a health nut and the ideal of eating a salad makes me gag. So ya probably way more beneficial to some one like me, then the local Gym Coach. Needed to put that out there.The only thing that sucks about this and the reason I gave it 4 stars is because the capsules are really big and I have to put in a lot of effort to swallow them. I would rather take 12 small capsules every morning, Then 6 big ones. Right, seriously!",
