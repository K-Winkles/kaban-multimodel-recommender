Although the directions state to take two vitamins per day, I don't need the ultra-high mega doses. I take one and can feel the benefits.I don't feel nauseated after taking this vitamin like I do with other brands. My energy has increased since taking this brand daily. Even the appearance and strength of my nails improved soon after starting this product which is important to me since I am a classical guitarist.I like the sources of the various nutrients are from quality sources.",
