My only complaint\u2014and this might be a me problem\u2014is I wish it had a different dropper. I kept knocking the bottle over accidentally while trying to drop it in my baby\u2019s baby food and lost so much of it on the floor. I would love it if they used one of those dispensers you turn the bottle upside down to dispense. Just an expensive mistake to lose all of my vitamins so easily.",
