                "reviewText": "Liposomal is the best form to take vitamins in. It is the form that is easier for the body to absorb and allows more drug to get to target areas of the body. It contains 1500mg per serving with is 3 capsules a day. The best way for this to take is with food so it will not irritate the stomach and consume it 3 times a day for continuous release and immune support. I take it in the morning, lunch and dinner time. The capsule has this odd smell I cannot distinguish. The capsule is easier to swallow as it is clear coated and doesn\u2019t have a bad taste. I usually pair this with glutathione capsule of lower dosage for more immune support especially this Covid crisis.Price point is acceptable.",
