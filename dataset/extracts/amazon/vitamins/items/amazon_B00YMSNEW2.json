                "reviewText": "Actually this 3-pack of \"Nature Made Vitamin C 1000mg, 100 Tablets\" ($21.57, 7 cents each) is a better deal than 'Amazon's Choice' of \"Nature Made Vitamin C 1000mg, 300 tablets\" ($24.41/ 8 cents each) where you save $2.84 for the 3-pack. And this is w/o subscribing for additional orders. Beside the better price the 300 tab bottle is too big for our kitchen cabinet and smaller sealed bottles may stay fresher.I was worried about how far out the expiration dates were? Happy to say when I received this 3-pack in April, 2016 one of the 100 tab bottles had an expiration date of Aug, 2019 while the other 2 bottles expire in Nov, 2019. Vitamins may not even last this long and with my wife & I taking 1/per day this 3-pack or 300 vitamins is a 5-month supply.Will say while I thought these vitamin bottles would be in a sealed 3-pack, like a 2-pack in stores, there were actually 3 separate bottles in a large baggie. But each bottle is individually sealed and hasn't been opened.We like these vitamin C tablets a whole lot better than the cheaper \"Spring Valley\" brand and still a great price!",
