                "reviewText": "I've just started using this brand of K2-D3. Out of 1500+ reviews, a high 86% are five-stars and another 10% four-stars. That speaks highly for its quality and value. For about 8 months now I've been ingesting various brands of K2 and D3, some combined and some separate, both pills and a liquid -- you use a few drops in the mouth and let it absorb. I believe that form helps it work more quickly.I've spent a lot of time in research on the value of Vitamin D3-K2, and my conclusion and experience are very positive.Vitamin D (specifically D3, the form you get from the sun) is essential for proper calcium absorption. Without D3, you may be missing out on benefits from the calcium in your diet.Vitamin K2 While vitamin D ensures calcium is absorbed, vitamin K2 (specifically as MK-7, the most bioavailable form) directs it to bones instead of arteries, where calcification or other issues could occur.Eight months ago the orthopedic doctor told me I need a double-knee replacement since both knees were bone on bone. That's very painful and makes it difficult to walk. The MRI also showed severe problems in my lower back that caused severe sciatica. The doctor said he couldn't guarantee surgery would solve that problem, and he recommended injections every 5 to 6 months. I'm glad to report that after 8 months of K2-D3 my sciatica is hardly noticeable. And my knees are better too, although I plan X-rays next month to see if cartilage has really built up. I am my best guinea pig and experiment on myself through natural means. This supplement of K2-D3 is one of those natural means.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Zhou D3+K2 5000 IU for years. I take them daily due to a lab test that revealed I had almost no vitamin D. I was tired, my back and hips were always achy, and I wasn't sleeping well due to the achiness. Also, have the beginnings of osteoporosis. In general, my body felt old and I was in my 50's. I'm an active hiker/walker and thought I wouldn't be able to keep this up the way things were going. The doctor prescribed 5000 of vitamin D daily. I thought that was a lot, but when I thought about it, I don't go out in the sun unless I'm covered up and I wearing sunscreen. I am lactose intolerant and don't get calcium from dairy products either.The prescription vitamin D was pricey and not covered by my insurance. But after 2 weeks of taking vitamin D3, I had no achy back or hips, was sleeping better, and felt good.I stopped the prescription vitamin D and found this one with some research. So glad I found it. Still feeling great.I do have to say that I didn't take it for about 2 weeks, maybe 3, life happens. And the backache/hip ache, and tiredness came back. Started taking D3+K2 and felt better again. Lab results came up normal for me, so I'm happy. I never knew vitamin D could make a difference in how my body feels. Anyway, 65 now, feel great, still actively hiking, walking, cooking, and entertaining. Love life!",
