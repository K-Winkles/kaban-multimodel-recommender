However, most people do not produce enough due to many factors. In addition, 95% of Americans do not consume enough Vitamin D from their diet alone. If you're the indoorsy type and get less than 15-30 minutes of direct sunlight per day, or if you've been diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency, then a dietary supplement is a great way to increase your vitamin D intake. Getting enough vitamin D is especially important as you age, so a vitamin D supplement is often recommended for people 65 years of age and over. Vitamin D aids in the absorption of calcium, to support teeth and bone health.\u2020 It also helps your immune health.\u2020 And Nature Made supplements are made with vitamin D3, which is the body\u2019s preferred form of vitamin D.",
