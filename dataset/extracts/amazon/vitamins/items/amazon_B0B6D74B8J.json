        "description": "C-Ya later! was created out of a desire to have a bioavailable source of Vitamin C readily available and easy to take. Not only does Vitamin C support your immune system, but you need it to form blood vessels and build cartilage, muscle, and collagen in your bones. While C-Ya later! is derived from superfoods (the most concentrated sources of Vitamin C on the planet), unfortunately, most other Vitamin C supplements on the market are derived from Ascorbic Acid. This synthetic compound only gives you a fraction of what you need to support your body. NOTE: This is a 30-day supply and contains 60 capsules. Take 2 capsules per day with water. Ingredients: Amla Extract, Acerola Cherry Extract, Organic Camu Camu, Rose Hips Proudly made in the USA!",
