                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to try this product, but I know how much biotin can do for my hair and nails so I wanted to give it this product a try.Back story on me and biotin:A couple years ago I took a biotin supplement that made my nails grow fast and strong, and my hair start to get more thick and lush, but right as the hair effects started kicking in I began to notice that the product was causing my skin to dramatically increase oil production and break out - badly. I am a little older for acne, so my oily/slightly-sensitive/acne-prone skin usually only graces me with clogged pores, tiny (but annoying) occasional hormonal breakouts and the very, very, very rare \"something didn't agree with my cyst\". For example, I did a cleanse awhile back and I got three teeny tiny cysts at the beginning, which did eventually clear up, but which were awful. The biotin supplement I took (This one: Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg Maximum Strength Tablets, 100 Count (Pack of 2) ) actually made my skin thick with oil I could scrape off three times a day with my nails, a dozen or more pimples and some cysts. It continued to get worse, rather than better like my skin did with the cleanse, until I realized it was the biotin which was causing the issue. I stopped taking it - drank a ton of water because biotin is water-soluble - and my skin began clearing literally within a day or two.The thing that made me sad was that the biotin was indeed making my nails grow long and super strong. It was almost as notable a difference as the oily breakouts on my face, except that was for the positive. It also had just begun to take effect on my fine hair when I had to stop for the sake of my skin, but it had been allowing my hair to grow strong and shed less. But having a horribly oily and broken out face was not worth the boost to my nails and hair, so I stopped taking the product, quickly losing the effects on my hair and shortly there after the effects on my nails. :-(For a couple years I was too scared to try biotin again. That is how bad it made my skin in the short time I took it. But when I saw this product, read the label to see the dosage was lower and that there were other vitamins mixed in the blend that supported the effects of the biotin, I thought I would give it one more try.So far I am very pleased with this product, and I have been watching my skin vigilantly for any sign of the issues I experienced before and haven't seen anything worrisome yet. Here is what I have to say about this product for the two weeks I have been taking it:1. The gummies taste pretty great. It's not candy, but better than a pill or a powder for sure. Be sure to chew them up well for best effects, per the manufacturer direction.2. This bottle is going to last you about a month and a half (135 pills, 3x a day = 45 days of doses). At ~$26 a bottle, I think it's a little pricier than some supplements, but this isn't just biotin as it has other vitamins as well, which support health skin, hair and nails. I think the value to cost ratio is going to depend on how the product works for you and what your budget is like.3. The effect on my nails was swift. I've included a photo of my nails showing how far my gel manicure has grown in 20 days. My right hand actually shows a stronger growth effect, but I had trouble taking a clean shot of my right hand, being right-handed.4. My hair has begun to shed less. With fine hair, we often have lots of tiny hairs, lots of oily sebum producing follicles - which I have both - and so I get oily scalp and I shed a lot of hair. It's annoying, but I've already noted that there are fewer hairs on my shirt throughout the day after the past week or so of use of this product.5. Again, I've been watching vigilantly for signs of increased oil production or pimples, and I've seen nothing of the sort. I suspect the 10,000 mg dose was simply too high for me, and this lower dose is effective but not so high as to cause my skin the issues the other product did.Bottom line: I think this is a little pricey but seems a good way to get beauty vitamins and minerals in your system to support your hair, skin and nails. I am already seeing the effects at 2 weeks, and I will watch for more positive signs of this products effects on me. I will also obviously look for signs of bad things happening to my skin. For now I recommend you try this, and pay attention to your body's reaction as I do, as it seems effective but supplements can cause different reactions in different people.I will be sure to update my review within the next month or so to let you all know if it is working the same, better or worse! I also want to remind you that if you have a problem with biotin making you oily or break out: Drink a LOT of water, and stop taking the product of course, because it is water soluble you can easily flush it from your system. And as this experiment has proven so far - you might just need a lower dose, but always pay attention to your body's signals and needs!Best of luck! Hope this has been helpful and please ask questions if you have them! :-)Note: I've posted a photo of my nails to show how much they have grown in the past 20 days - 14 of which were while taking this biotin supplement product. Please excuse my cuticles and ridges! We all have our beauty struggles and I am a little overdue to the nail salon! :PUPDATE 06/01/2016: It seems like this product more typically goes for around $15 a bottle, and I had misread the current price for the price I had paid which was about $12 with a coupon. At this price (~$15) I find the product much more reasonable to purchase and will be much more likely to choose this as a regular supplement product if it keeps going well for me. Though Amazon prices can flux radically, and sometimes it pays to grab a few when you see a good price and wait it out when the prices rocket, I thought this price difference was worth a mention.UPDATE 06/22/2016: I've used this product for a few more weeks. Restocked and I am on the second bottle. Now my nails are growing so fast that if they weren't all thick and healthy I would be annoyed! Because I get gel manicures (so they last and stay nice) but now they grow out almost twice as fast as before. I had my nails redone (because of something else that had gone wrong with them) but the week of growth looked more like my old two week of growth. Verdict is still out on the hair, but I am shedding LESS. I notice this as I wear dark shirts a lot and I used to have a lot of candy colored hair stuck to them and now I don't have hardly any, ever, outside of washing and brushing. To me this indicates that in time my hair will be thicker - with more hairs staying on my head, per shedding cycle. When I feel like I can say \"I only looped my pony holder 3 instead of 4 times!\" I promise to update for that, or any other news I might have. Oh, and no skin issues with acne or oil either. I am thrilled! Definitely recommend you try this tasty and effective beauty supplement to see if it works for you!UPDATE 09/01/2016: I have been very pleased with this product. My nails never break anymore, and they grow fast. Sometimes annoyingly fast for my gel manicures! Also, the real reason I had wanted to try this was for my hair. I found this product quite effective in making the most of what I've got - which is fine hair that is processed. My part is now much less apparent and my hair feels fluffier with almost zero effort. To maximize your results - which I *did* notice prior to me starting to use this shampoo/conditioner/spray - I recommend this line which helps you shed less: Ogx Shampoo Niacin 3 & Caffeine 13oz (2 Pack) . So, with this combo, the Biotin is a nutrient that makes your hair and nails grow strong and the niacin + caffeine helps you shed less, which basically equates to helping you have your fullest possible natural hair. No, it probably won't make super fine/thin hair look like a hair model's hair, but it does make your hair look its best! :DFinally, I recommend that if you consider giving this combo a shot, that you pay attention to how your body reacts to it (since I myself have had bad reactions to biotin in the past), that you are consistent with use of the products and that you use them for at least a month, preferably a few months, before you pass a complete judgment because supplements take time to get into your system to make a change to the body, and topical products that affect shed cycle will also take some time to show their benefit. Hope this review helped, that the products help and best of luck!UPDATE 09/05/2016: I forgot I had meant to update this to a 5 star product. I do like it that much. :-) And somehow my subject line got changed to a random portion of the middle of my review and makes no sense. It was refusing to update, so time will tell if this updates or that last update to the review subject line sticks!UPDATE 10/04/2016: Something I like to do when I am pretty sure I am not going crazy, and a product seems to be having a certain desirable effect, is I try out NOT taking it anymore -- to see what happens. So right after my last update - about 30 days ago - I stopped taking this and I stopped using my OGX Shampoo and Conditioner that I had mentioned above. HERE ARE THE RESULTS: Sort of the same was as a supplement takes awhile to work it's way into your system and slowly take effect for the better, stopping taking this product (and using the shampoo and conditioner) took awhile to show up as negative impact, too. My nails had been growing FAST as a result of this product, but suddenly they actually began to break for the first time in probably about 6 months. Not just one rogue accidental break but I actually broke several of them and had to cut my nails back to my fingertips, which also hasn't happened in 6 months. As for my hair, it very swiftly began a shed cycle, whereas before I was able to brush my hair and mostly not have to pick any hairs off my top for months... suddenly I was a shedding machine. Hairs upon hairs - in the brush, blown around the bathroom when I styled and alllllllll over my tops at work alllllllllll niiiiiiiiight loooooong. Very annoying. I am going to go back on the supplement and using the hair products now and see how it goes! I will be sure to update in either about a month - or when I first begin to see positive results. :-)",

But it works, I\u2019m hooked now. I can\u2019t wait to see the results of my hair after a few more months. Oh and it tastes good too! Almost like a treat.",
