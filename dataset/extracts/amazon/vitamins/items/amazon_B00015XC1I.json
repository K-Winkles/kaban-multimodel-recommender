I did research first and though the studies said the upper limit is safe to take, this and most brands have the upper limit of 3000 mcg and the recommended daily dose for women is 700 mcg and 900 mcg for men. So you can see this vitamin is way over that recommendation, however they do say 3000 mcg likely won\u2019t hurt you. But it\u2019s not recommended so I am taking it only a few times a week instead of daily. Vitamins are not regulated so please research before taking any supplements. That said the product seems to be good quality and reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "After taking allergy pills, drops etc, I felt I was destined to suffer with chronic watery eyes forever. It was something i was diagnosed with and it was something I figured I had to live with. I thought there\u2019s nothing that can help my eye makeup stay on, there\u2019s nothing to stop the irritation, I just accepted it. That is when I decided to do my research and check into vitamin a!These vitamin a pills are amazing and I\u2019ll probably continue to get this brand because it\u2019s been so powerful and effective at healing my eyes. My eyes now RARELY water and I swear it\u2019s due to these vitamins. If you have chronic watery eyes you may have a vitamin a deficiency and I really hope you give this product a go. Hopefully it works for you as well as it does for me!!!",
