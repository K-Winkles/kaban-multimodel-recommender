And being waterbased gummies, it will depend on the temperature of the factory how much water evaporates as they cool. SO they likely package by weight and not by count. ANYWAY, I only eat about 1/2 at a time per day and that solves my issues. I'm not sure why I need these, but occasionally I feel off and I have one of these and it seems to help immediately. I have never used any supplements before and these work great for me. 1/2 half a gummy seems to work fine.",
