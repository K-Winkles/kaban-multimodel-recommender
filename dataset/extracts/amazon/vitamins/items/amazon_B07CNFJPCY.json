                "reviewText": "First impression:The packaging was clean and not overloaded with information/text. The ingredients looked great, healthy, and there were none I was afraid about putting into my body. I noticed right away there was a variety of flavors that were all clear to tell which was which as the colors of the gummies are separate for each flavor. My first impression of the taste was very positive. They are a little tart, but taste good and match the flavors they say they are. Product is organic and Non-GMO. All of MaryRuth's products are made in small batches to ensure freshness and quality.Review:This is a great product. With all the gummies on the market a new gummy really needs to do something to stick out and Mary Ruth's has figured out how to do just that. This vegan, plant based gummy has great taste without the bad parts of most gummies. The gummies aren't just healthy but actually taste good as well. I don't normally like cherry gummies, but this one was alright and I loved both the grape and orange. If someone were to ask me for recommendations on gummies for Vitamin C this product would be new answer. Another positive to them is they only have 5 calories per serving so you aren't hurting your diet by eating one. If you or anyone you know struggles to get enough vitamin C into your every day diet then you should try these gummies out.",
