                "reviewText": "This is the first vitamin I\u2019ve stuck with for over 4 months non stop. Usually I\u2019ll start taking vitamins and then get bored and start forgetting them or forget to take them with food. Not an issue with these since they taste so good that it\u2019s my desert after a meal. Since daily dose is like 6 of them, I take some after breakfast and some after lunch.Effects: these are also the first vitamins I feel a noticeable difference with. I feel more energy each day, probably due to B and D vitamins. Due to that, I try not to take them too late in the evening. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed right away is a lot more regular bowel movements. My friends who tried them said they\u2019ve noticed the same. That being said, if you eat more than daily dose because they taste so good, you might be extra regular.Ingredients: I love that it has every vitamin you need based on latest research. Over the last decade there have been a lot of studies that say it can be dangerous to take D vitamins without K2 with it. And although many D3 specific vitamins do include K2, I have not seen that in a multivitamin yet, other than this one. Granted K2 is a little low here but better than nothing. Also, I\u2019ve read up on the actual ingredients of these vitamins and turns out that many that I read about are the best source for your body to absorb as natural vitamins. Probably the reason why I actually feel a difference with these as opposed to the other ones where I just get bright yellow pee. Also, I have not seen multivitamins that have omega oils. Not only that, you cannot taste it at all. When I\u2019ve taken fish oil, It would taste so awful and then I\u2019d be burping up oil for hours. With these I do not have any of these side effectsTaste: I saw that some people are saying that theirs are covered with sugar or too sweet. The company describes the types they have and which ones are sugar covered. The ones I order are not covered in sugar although they do have sugar in them. I hate overly sweet things and candies. These are not overly sweet. I would say they are a bit on the sour side and have sugar to counteract that a bit but not too much. They are very pleasant. They are NOT gummy bear texture though. They are not chewy. So if you bite into them, it will be like biting into thicker jello. So the texture feels weird initially when you are expecting it to be chewy, but once you no longer expect that, the texture is awesome. I tend to suck on them or chew them if in a hurry",

                "reviewText": "Not only are they tasty with no real hint of that nasty vitamin flavor but she actually feels more energetic after just a couple of weeks of using them. Swears she can notice a difference so... I know the ones I have for me the men's version are definitely noticeable when I have them versus when I don't. Not Superman or anything but just balanced if it makes any sense? Definitely good vitamins and not like powdery pills the gelatin helps retain the vitamins in your gut and helps your body process them versus just being passed through. Worth the money",

I\u2019ve taking vitamins all my life in various forms and brands and this one has really made an evident impact.My skin is glowing and my energy level has definitely improved. But the most evident change has been my hair! I\u2019ve struggled with stringy thin hair all my life and now I am constantly getting compliments about how thick and healthy my hair looks after two weeks of taking these. My diet hasn\u2019t change with the exception of taking these vitamins. They taste good, like gummy candy and are chewy. You do have to take six so I split them before breakfast and dinner. I would definitely suscribe to this product!",

                "reviewText": "I underwent a routine checkup with my primary care physician, expressing my constant fatigue and occasional blurred vision. In response, my doctor recommended incorporating multivitamins and omega 3 supplements into my daily routine for enhanced nutrition and overall well-being. Intrigued by this advice, I conducted a spontaneous online search for supplements, and SmartyPants quickly caught my attention with its overwhelmingly positive reviews. What drew me in was its unique combination of vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids presented in a convenient gummy form. This not only streamlined my supplement intake but also alleviated my aversion to large tablets.After three weeks of consistent use, I've experienced a notable improvement in my energy levels, a welcome boost that has positively impacted my daily activities. Additionally, I've observed enhanced skin elasticity, contributing to an overall sense of vitality. The convenience of having both vitamins and omega-3 in a single, tasty gummy has made incorporating these supplements into my routine not only beneficial but also enjoyable. However, while the overall experience has been positive, it's worth noting that the taste resembles that of a regular sugar candy without any distinct flavor. Nonetheless, the positive effects on my well-being far outweigh this minor drawback, making SmartyPants a valuable addition to my daily health regimen.",

I absolutely despise gummies, and even I make sure to choke mine down at least 3 times a week. Here's why:\u2013 100% Vitamin D. Yup.\u2013 Biotin\u2013 Fish oils for brain and even eye health\u2013 Multi B- No ironAs a 40-something woman, I have yet to find a multivitamin that gives 100% of daily Vitamin D. I usually have to take one multivitamin and supplement with another. Having it all in one product is what sold me on it.NOW...1 DOWNSIDE. It's like candy. Keep it out of reach of the littles. They will pester you daily to take it. Trust me. I discovered that the bottle of the kids gummies was a little lighter one week and panicked. Turns out my kiddo was taking them every day with breakfast on her own. Hooray for taking initiative and showing responsibility, but scary because taking too many could have disastrous results. Keep these out of reach of your 10-and-under children.",
