                "reviewText": "These have been great at reducing the number of pills I have to take daily. They are significantly less sweet than most other gummies which is probably why some reviews say they don\u2019t like the taste. The flavor starts out pretty neutral without much taste and finishes a little fruity. I personally plan on sticking with them, but I can understand why others might not like the taste.",
