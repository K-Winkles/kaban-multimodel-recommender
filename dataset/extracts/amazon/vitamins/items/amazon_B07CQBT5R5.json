From strengthening the immune system by playing a key role in the immune response to toxins and pathogens to promoting skin and heart health, Vitamin C is definitely vital to good health. If you fail to meet the daily minimum, you may suffer from weak defence, skin problems, and even heart troubles and other issues. In case your regular diet fails to provide you with the minimum required values of Vitamin C, the most common consequence is compromised resistance and increased chances of diseases. To avoid this, consuming daily Vitamin C supplements can prove to be beneficial in increasing your ability to resist diseases and overall health. While many types of Vitamin C supplements are available, Liposomal Vitamin C formulations have shown higher efficiency and absorbability. Encapsulated within globules of fat called liposomes, once consumed, Vitamin C droplets at the centre of the liposomes are then easily absorbed within the digestive system as they are fat-soluble.",

                "reviewText": "As a diabetic of 43 years, I've done pretty well. I can still see and pee and have all my feet and toes. I recently learned how high dose vitamin C can get rid of those age spots that mar our complexion as we get older. I had a big dark spot on my face go away and today I looked down at my feet and one of two scars was gone and the other was going. They had been there for several years. and They say diabetics don't heal well. Our bodies need Vitamin C to make collagen and to keep our skin healthy we all need more than the RDA, but Diabetics even more so. Diabetics use up our vitamin C quicker than most other people and it is a strong anti-oxidant. Even though I am doing fairly well, I did have a heart attack 10 years ago. My arteries were brittle and since I wasn't taken vitamin C at that time, my body didn't have the materials to repair and keep my arteries flexible. I take this Liposomal C and I also take another Vitamin C 1:1. I have taken up to 40,000 mg in a day spread out throughout the course of the day. Like 2,000 and hour. No ill effects and with some pleasant surprises such as I described.",

                "reviewText": "I am taking this, as recommended by our Dr. friend, and it is something I will continue even after and when the CoVid crisis ends. Not only does it make me feel better but has also helped my digestive issues to a degree. Any little 'degrees' of help I can get are a bonus.I have remained healthy in spite of being 'out there' working and could possibly have been in contact with the CoVid virus. Haven't had any health issues at all since last Dec. when a bunch of us co workers had bronchitis. I tried another brand of Liposomal Vit C and it was not as effective as this brand.",

This product using the liposomal technology delivery system allows me to get high levels into my bloodstream for a very affordable price by bypassing my stomach. I take 4 capsules a day and intend on doing it forever.",
