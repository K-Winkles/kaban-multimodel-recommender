Vitamin A works as an antioxidant, fighting cell damage. Iron is essential for red blood cell formation, a deficiency causes anemia and fatigue. Copper helps iron absorption into the blood, thereby plays an important role in energy production. Panax Ginseng helps blood circulation booster supports tiredness and increases energy levels Supports Cognitive Health and Alertness Vitamin E Alpha Tocopherol facilitates cellular function and helps widen blood vessels to improve blood flow to the extremities and brain. Vitamin C is important in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine, but it also protects the brain against oxidative stress. Copper, Zinc, Iodine and Selenium support mind balance and neurotransmitter function and generation. Inositol helps reduce anxiety by regulating serotonin. Choline is required to make Acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter. Supports Immune System Vitamin C is one of the most potent natural immune system boosters. Vitamin C deficiency makes us more prone to sickness. Daily intake of vitamin C is essential for good health because your body doesn\u2019t produce or store it. CoQ10 a potent antioxidant supports immune system response especially in immune compromised conditions. Citrus Bioflavonoids, work in synergy with Vitamin C to boost immune health and infection resistance. Supports Heart Health, Joint and Skeletal Strength Vitamin D (D-3, Cholecalciferol) is produced by the body. Sunlight is a good source of Vitamin D; insufficient exposure affects heart health, bones, joint, teeth. Vitamin B3 Niacin helps lower cholesterol and triglycerides, regulate blood circulation and blood pressure to support heart function. Copper, a trace mineral plays a key role in heart muscle contraction and in bone strength. Manganese supports bone joint anti inflammatory health",

                "reviewText": "I've been taking these vitamins for two years without any issues. The vitamins are a liquid filled capsule to improve absorption. My last order arrived with a sticky substance coating the capsules. I use a pill case and the sticky coating transferred to the inside of the case. The pill case became sticky enough to \"glue\" small medications to its walls. I didn't notice this at first and missed several medications as a result. I contacted Clinical Daily using eMail and informed them of the problem. They replied two days later and offered to send me a replacement, I accepted. Two days later the replacement arrived. They explained that if the vitamins are exposed to high heat the capsules can leak. I'm guessing that if vitamins are exposed to high heat they will degrade. As we enter the summer season delivery systems are going to, unavoidably, get hot. Exposed to this heat the vitamins may lose some of their potency and leak as a result. Amazon and Clinical Daily need to find a way to prevent this damage. I am very satisfied with the support I received and the resolution of my issue.",
