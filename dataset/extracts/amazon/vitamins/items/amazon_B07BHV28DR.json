I was taking this biotin and collagen (plus vitamins included too) and noticed that I was clipping my fingernails and my toenails more than even. At the 3 weeks mark I realized not only were my malls growing faster, there were also looking better. My toes were not pretty but now they look healthy and the only addition I made in the area of \"hair, skin and nail supplements\" was using nature's bounty brand for 3 months.These are SO full of orangey flavor you'll not at all think of this as a supplement. Yes, they're really that tasty but follow directions and they are not candy!! They are easy to chew and swallow!You can't beat the price considering how well these work.Ladies and guys you're not alone. I how this information is helpful",

                "reviewText": "I highly recommend these gummies! I was losing a lot of hair....to the point where I would panic every time I took a shower because I would expect a dust bunny size clump of hair to come out....sometimes multiple clumps!! I tried these gummies because I saw a lot of ladies taking them online. I was skeptical to say the least.Boy....am I glad I tried these! First off, they taste delicious so I can't help but feel like I indulged in gummy bears first thing in the morning--my little secret \"medicine\" ;)I noticed after consistently taking them for a few months that I am losing far less hair in the shower, and my hair has been growing like Rapunzel! I trimmed my bangs recently and they grew to my chin in less than 2 months on these gummies whereas before it would take a lot longer for them to grow to that length.I also notice my skin is glowing with these! I did not have fine wrinkles before taking these gummies, but I just feel that my skin looks better in terms of dullness.The only con for these gummies is I do not find it works at all for my nails- I still have brittle soft nails that peel. I would rate these 1/5 stars if I was only taking them to strengthen my nails. Maybe they should call these \"Hair and Skin gummies\" and take out the nails part!Overall, I highly recommend these gummies for growing hair quickly and also for losing less hair! And they make your skin glow too :) Avoid if you are just looking for something to strengthen your nails!",

My hair feels stronger, my skin looks clearer, and my nails are healthier than ever.The addition of biotin in this supplement has made a noticeable difference in the thickness and shine of my hair. I've also seen a significant improvement in the overall texture and tone of my skin. It feels smoother and more hydrated.What's even more impressive is the impact it's had on my nails. They used to be brittle and prone to breakage, but now they're long, strong, and virtually chip-free. I'm constantly getting compliments on my manicures!I appreciate that this supplement uses high-quality ingredients, and I haven't experienced any adverse effects. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I've had no issues with digestion.Overall, Nature's Bounty Hair, Skin & Nails with Biotin has become an essential part of my beauty routine. I love knowing that I'm nourishing my body from the inside out, and the results speak for themselves. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to boost their hair, skin, and nail health!",
