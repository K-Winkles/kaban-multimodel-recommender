                "reviewText": "My daughter has had a vitamin D deficiency for many years as well as osteoporosis. Her doctors have tried prescription dosages, as well as daily supplemental D \u2014 nothing made much of a difference except moving her level maybe 5-10 points over a year. Then I came across the Bluebonnet Brand sold at Whole Foods (I also have ordered from Amazon) . This has made a huge difference \u2014 her levels have gone from 26 to 59 since we started using this product. It contains fish oil unlike most of the other products she has tried. Her neurologist and bone doctor were amazed at her levels and asked me what I was giving her!",

I was recommended by a doctor who now practices natural healthy choices and not just recommending just for sales but for benefits and the best ingredients. I love this product because it does not leave that fishy burp, you may know what I am talking about. I really only take this product for me and my family and would recommend it for yours as well.",

Never knew that before. I get plenty in the summer but I guess zero in the winter so everyone living above a certain latitude needs supplemental D. I assume these are good ones. Just ordered my 2nd bottle so I'm back which is positive.",
