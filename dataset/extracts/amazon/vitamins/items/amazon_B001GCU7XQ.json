                "reviewText": "Vit E is advertised to be a good antioxidant as well as other benefits. So in looking for relief from knee pain without taking over-counters or prescription drugs I began taking this. I took this along with turmeric (have reviewed this also, if interested in brand, seek out my review ) and also collagen (again, can get product I used in my reviews). Was pleasantly surprised to have my knee pain disappear. So not sure which of 3 or is it a combination of those (?) that has benefitted me but I am extremely happy with results and will cont. all 3 at this point",
