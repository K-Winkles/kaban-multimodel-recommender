                "reviewText": "I'd like to start out by saying I can appreciate the time and effort that goes into creating good products like this. The amounts of vitamins in these are close to excellent. These are a little low on Vitamin E, vitamin K, Choline, and Magnesium. I still appreciate these tiny, easy to swallow children's multi-vitamins. They certainly pack a lot for being so tiny. They are so small that it is a little difficult to open them up to sprinkle into my babies juices. It goes best in grape juice or something like a smoothy if they are old enough to notice, but never milk, dont even take them with milk. But my 7 year old and 10 year old had no worries or even hesitated to swallow 3 at once. Yes, I was shocked. But there are a few other small down sides. So these lack Vitamin E, K, Choline,and magnesium. The label doesn't reassure me enough that none of the vitamins are synthetic. So I have to do research to find out for sure. I do notice the additive called magnesium stearate, which is an oil additive that prevents clumping BUTmay or may not be harmful. I'm not sure how effective magnesium stearate is, but it is still a little controversial and should be left out. Other companies are stepping up to the plate in the organic field and it wont be long before the controversial additives and synthetic ingredients are absent with a larger variety of quality product for consumers to commit to.Since this multi-vitamin is lacking all of those vitamins and needs an oil based additive, I believe Wheat Germ Oil would be the perfect supplement for the magnesium stearate. It has everything this multi-vitamin is missing. Which is Vitamin E, K, choline and both Omega-3's and Omega-6's. And Fats are definitely important. How convenient.Wheat Germ Oil:Phytosterols 1206mgCholine 43.6mgVitamin E (Alpha Tocopherol) 326mgVitamin K 53.9 mcgTotal trans-polyenoic fatty acids Total Omega-3 fatty acids 15044mgTotal Omega-6 fatty acids. 119457mgTotal Fat 218g 335%Saturated Fat 41.0 gMonounsaturated Fat 32.9gPolyunsaturated Fat 135gAnd BTW this vitamin does state on the back that vitamin E's DV% is fulfilled, but from what I've learned it's falling very short. 10IU is not enough. But like I said, The amounts of vitamins in this childrens multi vitamin are impressive, easy to swallow, and mixes well with juice in baba's for the babies who can't swallow them. I will purchase again. Until I find something even better.",

                "reviewText": "My 9, 7, and even 3 year old have no trouble swallowing this product. I was skeptical At first, but thought I could always empty the capsules into apple sauce if the kids had a hard time. Nope! They picked it up within a couple of days, even the three year old! I\u2019m so glad we decided to try these because everyone loves them and they are soo easy. All of the good stuff, none of the junk. I think it\u2019s worth seeing if your kid is capable of swallowing something. They are about as big around as a tick tack, but twice the length. I did take it apart for the toddler the first time and it was easy to stir into apple sauce- but it did turn it pink! Probably the magnesium. She ate it no problem, then I taught her to swallow the pill whole in a spoon full of apple sauce, and nod she just takes them with water. The ingredients are high quality and I feel like they have way more than your average kids gummy vitamin. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Probably the most important thing about these multivitamins is that my kids take them without complaint. They are small - perfect for swallowing. They don't taste like anything. They don't cause stomach issues when taken on an empty stomach. We've used these consistently for the last couple of years and are very happy with them. As a parent, I especially love that there are pills available vs having to resort to chewables or gummies.",
