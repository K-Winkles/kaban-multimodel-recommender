If you'd rather take your B Vitamins (like B 12 & 6) together in one convenient capsule, look no further! Divine Bounty offers one of the most potent Vitamin B-Complex formulas available.",
            "Best Value For Money - Not only do we offer a high potency formula, each bottle contains 90 B Complex capsules, making it one of the best value vitamin B supplements available. The B-complex group are water-soluble vitamins, not easily stored in the body and thus need to be replenished frequently. Most comparable brands offer less capsules or a lower potency formula. With more capsules per bottle and superior potency per capsule, Divine Bounty is great value for money.",
            "Highest Quality Ingredients - Our formula is made up of only pure ingredients with no harmful additives. Simply the full B-Complex plus the combo of Inositol and Choline, two naturally occurring close cousins to the B Vitamin family. Our capsules are non GMO, soy free, gluten free and have no preservatives, stearates, silicone dioxide or artificial ingredients. A pure, clean formula.",
            "Daily B Complex Vitamins - Our bodies use B vitamins every day, and while diet is always the best way to get these essential vitamins, it\u2019s not always possible to get enough of all 8 b vitamins from food alone. Use the Divine Bounty B Complex formula to supplement any deficiencies. Also sometimes called Super B, Stress B Complex, or B-100, it can also be taken as powder, tablets, pills, or soft gel caps.",

Divine Bounty gives you a superior dose of all the Vitamin-B your body needs on a daily basis in just one convenient capsule. - Superior Formula - Our powerful Vitamin B capsules combine the 8 essential B-Vitamins with their naturally occurring cousins, Inositol and Choline. As B-Vitamins are not easily stored in the body, we give your body a chance to absorb what it needs by providing a higher potency of each ingredient. - Superior Value - Don't get caught having to re-order every month with brands that offer a much lower potency or fewer capsules per bottle. Containing 90 easy-to-swallow capsules, your bottle of Divine Bounty Vitamin B Complex is real value for money. - Superior Quality - We only use natural ingredients enclosed in vegetarian capsules. This means our supplement does not contain any harmful chemicals, stearates, artificial ingredients, fillers or preservatives.

                "reviewText": "I have purchased these vitamins 2 times in the past and was completely satisfied with them. They were high quality and truly boosted my energy and mood. The third bottle I purchased in June \u201823 was not the same product. The b complex has a VERY distinct odor and taste that is quite unpleasant, but I\u2019ve gotten quite used to it. The new bottle lacked that odor and absolutely smelled and tasted 100% like turmeric. I am quite disappointed not only because I feel I am out the money for the bottle but also because I very much enjoyed the last 2 bottles of the quality b complex I had purchased before. Have reached out to the company via their website, will update if they offer any help.EDIT:After contacting divine bounty, they sent me a replacement bottle and have offered a full refund for my original bottle. The customer service is outstanding. I am not sure what to make of things with the new bottle. The capsules are having a different effect on me than they have had in the past, not a pleasant one. I don\u2019t know if the formulation has changed or it is just me. After smelling the capsules more, I don\u2019t think they were turmeric, but they do not smell the same as my previous 2 bottles did. Could not be happier tho with the way I was treated by them as far as customer service.",
