And I tried so many things, only zinc, vitamin a and spearmint tea worked for me. Vitamin A really is a game changer, I tried this as a last resort and all my skin pumps have dissappeared. But I do take two pills a day. At least for now. Happy customer \u2661 thank you",

                "reviewText": "I Like that this product does not contain oils or soy and that it\u2019s sourced from a natural beta carotene however, it only comes with 30 capsules per jar. I think it\u2019s silly to order multiple bottles, we get a bit of a discount but it\u2019s still too expensive. In fact a lot of this company\u2019s products are too expensive. This will probably prevent me from being a continued customer, I will most likely look for an alternative unless this changes.",
