Almost 50% of U.S. adults are not getting enough Vitamin C through their daily food intake (1). If you just want to make sure you\u2019re getting what your body needs, Vitamin C supplements may help.

Ok, had a surgical procedure 1998 & was given pain meds & after was Unable to relive stool for little over a week. I've done either one or multiple of these heart-healthy exercises in one single day everyday from 1987-2010 (gym-rat, cyclyst, jogger, paddle all/handball player, roller skater, & swimmer) and not one time did I hear or read just how crucial Vitamin C is for our bodies inside & outside. Confided to a friend & was suggested to take Vitamin C, appx 1,000mg per day. He said, which I later read to be a fact, that the Vitamin C will relieve my issue but also was told just how important Vitamin C is for our system & should be taken each day just like our multivitamin.So NatureMade was my multivitamin & I loved it so it made easy sense for me to add my C vitamin with the same brand. I take all chewable vitamins because I have a mental problem swallowing pills & these C's do not taste chalky or bitter. I usually chew 3 per day.",

I just wish they'd decrease the sugar a fair amount. It seems counter productive to make a Vitamin C that many use as preventative and others use as maintenance -- just to add so much sugar. Sugar feeds Inflammation and virus. I'll keep buying it unless I find a better one.",
