But was out of D-3 and needed it the next day and went on Amazon. I was reading about it that it is in coconut oil suspension. I thought that is interesting. A lot more than what I normally spend, but went for it. This is the Holy Grail of D3. I thought I was getting a bang out of my old D3, well this is getting a bang out of this earth! The increased amount of energy is amazing. The digestion of it is perfect. I will not switch to another D3 ever again! I can only say if you really want high quality D3 with an excellent absorbing powers, buy this. Don't even look at anything else. This is my 3rd bottle. I am so serious on this. This is what D3 is suppose to do. This company and it's product is the best product out there. Thank-you",
