                "reviewText": "After taking these vitamins for almost a year, I can say they are great and do work really well. My hair has always grown rather quickly, but I does seem much healthy. My nails grow very quickly and extremely long, but since taking these vitamins my nails are growing in strong! Even with them being very long they don\u2019t break as easily as they would normally tend to do. As far as skin benefits I think I will need to take these vitamins longer to actually tell. Nonetheless, we start losing the amount of collagen our body produces naturally around early-mid twenties, so taking high dosages daily will of course help with keeping your skin from aging as quickly. All in all these have been wonderful vitamins which I will continue to take.",

I\u2019ve gotten used to the taste(just swallow them quickly!) I take them first thing in the morning , no stomach issues at all. I wish I could locate the protein content of each serving but mostly just out of curiosity.HIGHLY recommended! I\u2019ve got it on auto shop! 2nd round starting soon! Super happy with it and with the cost! It fits my budget perfectly!",

It dissolved well, like a coffee creamer does and the heartburn issue resolved and my hair started filling in at the temples. I was thrilled. I ordered the two pack and started the second bottle, but it appears the formula has changed. The powder clumps up in hard lumps, in my coffee and does not dissolve. I get severe heartburn if I take the capsules, and severe heartburn if I open them and try to mix them with my coffee. I will be looking for another brand that dissolves better.",
