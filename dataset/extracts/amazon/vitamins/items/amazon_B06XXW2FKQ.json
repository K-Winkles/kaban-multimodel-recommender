                "reviewText": "My kids love these. They like the flavor and they quickly dissolve. They\u2019re easy to take, no pills to try to get kids to swallow and no messy liquids that can spill or stain. Plus unlike gummies they aren\u2019t coated in sugar or filled with gelatin. They\u2019re vegan so suitable for most diets and restrictions. And they\u2019re D3 which is absorbed by the body better than D2.",

And honestly, I know that they\u2019ve been keeping them well also. It seems like every other week they\u2019re sick but now, NOPE! Healthy, no coughing, runny nose, sneezing NOTHING!! I even take them since they have a high dosage of IUs! I\u2019m so happy I found them. And, no sugar! All good ingredients. Oh, and they\u2019re cute! The little face on them is the cutest! lol",
