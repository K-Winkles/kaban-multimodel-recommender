They taste a bit strange at first, but you quickly get used to them. And I'm not sure if it's the vitamins or just a placebo effect, but I feel better overall since I started taking them. I have more energy, and I haven't been sick at all.If you're looking for a gummy multivitamin that's easy to take and made with good ingredients, I recommend SmartyPants. Just be prepared for a bit of a weird taste at first.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When I first saw the instructions said to take 4 per day, I thought \u201cman that\u2019s a lot,\u201d but I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s not less than that because I could eat 20 of these things. They\u2019re so delicious.The ingredients are fantastic and I really like the messages on the packaging, such as every batch being third-party lab tested, everything is organic, it\u2019s probiotic, did I mention delicious? The texture is *similar* to a gummy (in that yes, it\u2019s squishy), but not exactly. Your teeth bite straight through with very little pressure. I actually love it. They\u2019re much more quick to dissolve than a traditional gummy and way easier to chew. If you ask me, they\u2019re just straight up awesome.Update - FYI: Don\u2019t buy these if they\u2019re on sale. I did, and got a batch that was loaded with moisture. Tossed them out. These gummies are supposed to be completely dry so a good batch will have no moisture inside and the gummies will feel dry to the touch. No stickiness at all.",

The fish oil is the primary reason I use these. There are many studies of the benefits of fish oil for cognitive function which is what I\u2019m looking for primarily in these.The taste of these has always been great, there is none of the typical vitamin taste in these.",
