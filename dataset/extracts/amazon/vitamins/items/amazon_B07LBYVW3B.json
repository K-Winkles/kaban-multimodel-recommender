I just finished a 60 day supply.I like the taste, which is kind of like a whoppers malt ball without the chocolate.Unlike the name brand Centurium vitamins, these GNC for Men 50 Plus do NOT make me nauseated, and they do NOT give me an acid reflux vitamin taste like Centurium and other leading brands.I like that I only have to take one vitamin a day, but it is a big vitamin, the length of a quarter, and at first it was difficult to swallow. I've got used to taking them now.I feel the 60 day supply is generous compared to other brands, and I like feeling as though I am getting my money's worth.Other brands including the one mentioned, made me feel lousy so I had stopped taking vitamins for several years, then I tried them again and same thing happened. However, with these GNC vitamins, that hasn't happened, I've actually been feeling a lot better during the past 60 days of using it.I did research on the vitamins and minerals that I need and are recommended while shopping for a brand and formula, this Men's 50 Plus vitamin met the goal.",
