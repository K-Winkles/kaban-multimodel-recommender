We tried another brand of chewable high-quality vitamin that was twice the price, put they tasted sour and chalky. (I\u2019m eating those so they aren\u2019t wasted, and they are yucky \ud83e\udd22) My daughter now reminds me if I forget to give her a vitamin! I tried one and agree, they taste great. The only problem is she wants more than one \ud83d\ude05. I keep them hidden so she won\u2019t eat the whole bottle!",
