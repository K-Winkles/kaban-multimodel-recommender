                "reviewText": "I have never left a review but these are great! Natural sources of vitamin b are more absorbable and easier to use by the body so I was looking into natural options. This is made out of 100% nutritional yeast instead of chemicals. I actually bought these for my cats, as my one cat is deficient, and nutritional yeast mimics the flavor of cheese (which most cats surprisingly love), and is often used by pet owners and sprinkled on top of their food to make picky cats and dogs more willing to eat since it tastes so great! These are dosed properly, and I just pop open the capsule and sprinkle it on my cats food. I read a lot of reviews about how the pill is ginormous to swallow, but if I took these myself, I would just open the capsule and put it on top of my food or mix it in with my drink so that is not an issue with me! I also love that these vitamins have methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin. Methylcobalamin is more absorbable by the body also, and I could not find nutritional yeast with methylcobalamin, except in this Amazon vitamin. It literally checks all the boxes for me 1) natural 2) proper dose 3) tastes great 4) has methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin. I will continue to buy this for my cats, and for myself and my family. Amazon please keep making these and don't ever discontinue them!",

                "reviewText": "I've taken vitamin B supplements for a few years to help with energy, focus, and strangely relaxation too. I have an old sports injury in my neck (herniated disc) that occasionally flares up and touches off a chain reaction of pain down my back. I take B-complex vitamins whenever I feel the onset of my neck/back issues to help keep my back relaxed and give me enough time to get to my chiropractor.In short, I think vitamin B is the bee's knees and Amazon's take on the vitamin business does a fantastic job. I was initially attracted to Amazon's version because it doesn't feature the mega, mega doses found in other supplements. I also like the simple, plain ingredients used including in the gel capsule.I've taken Amazon's B-complex for a few weeks and I'm getting the same energy, focus and relaxed feeling that I typically associate with other B-complex vitamins I've tried from other brands. It's a win for me!Great product, recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This has been the only B-complex vitamin I've ever been able to take without experiencing nausea. I still make sure to take it with food just in case. But after 4 months I've had no upset stomach with it. Every B vitamin I've ever tried in the past made me nauseous. I'm not sure exactly why, but I'm unable to find another company/manufacturer that has the same ingredients as this one. So I'll continue to order this one as it's very important for a person like me to take this kind of supplement. And it is a good price.",
