My experience was that I took 3,000 mg of these everyday and I didn\u2019t get a cold virus when everyone else around me did. My husband who never gets sick (literally one cold in 14 years) got a cold/virus and I never got it. I started getting him to take it, and his cold is out improving. My very picky daughter doesn\u2019t like the flavor, so I cut them in quarters (they are large tablets) so she can swallow them.Also, the price is the best I have found for a quality Vitamin C chewable.My only critique is that they are a little bitter and acidic, but I think that\u2019s probably because they aren\u2019t loaded with added sugar-so it\u2019s probably a good thing. I just make sure to have a glass of water handy when I take them.I would recommend these to everyone that doesn\u2019t like getting sick.",

                "reviewText": "While this vitamin C is a good product in my opinion, the price has increased drastically. The vitamin C tablets are in chewable form. It's slightly sweet and slightly tart, but I've really enjoyed the flavor and for the value at the time of my purchases, thought this was one of the best deals on Amazon. I paid $9.99 for the same size as currently listed, 180 chewable tablets. Now, it is selling for $12.99, a $3 increase, with a list price of $15.28. Supposedly saving you $2.29...that is not true. When I purchased this item, twice over several months, the cost was not a sale price but original price at $9.99. So don't let them make you believe you're getting such a great deal at 15% savings. I'm fed up with Amazon trying to make you feel as though you're getting a deal when there are thousands of verified purchasers who know the original prices of the items they received. Other than that folks, if you like chewable vitamin C tablets, it is worth a try.",

                "reviewText": "I don't get those people who complain that they were duped into buying this because it takes two tablets to equal 1,000 mg of Vitamin C. It's clear in the listing - clear on the pictures of the label - there's no deceit here. It is quite common for Vitamin C chewable tablets to be 500 mg - so with many brands you have to take two to get a 1,000 mg dose. I buy these mostly because I like the flavor. Sometimes chewable Vitamin C is just too tart for my likes. I also like that I can take my 1,000 mg dose (2 tablets) then supplement during the day with 500 mg (1 tablet) doses when I feel I need an extra boost of Vitamin C.",
