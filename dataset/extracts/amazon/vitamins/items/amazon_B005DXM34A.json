These essential nutrients are vital for converting food into cellular energy and support nervous system function. There are 8 B vitamins generally included in the B complex: Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), B6 (Pyridoxine), Biotin (B7), Folic Acid (B9), and B12 (Cyanocobalamin). Vitamins B6, B9 (Folic Acid) and B12 are often linked with brain health. They work together to help brain and body cells produce SAM-e, which is important for mood health.+ Adequate intake of B vitamins is especially important for those who experience low energy, eat plant-based diets, and women of childbearing age or pregnant women.+ B vitamins are foundational to whole body health, but various factors can influence how much of these essential nutrients we need and consume daily. For example, Folic Acid (B9) is particularly important for pregnant women and women of childbearing age. Vitamin B12 is important for vegetarians and vegans who may not consume enough from their diet alone. Dietary supplements can help provide essential B vitamins that may be lacking in the diet.+",

I take them on certain days along with my Nature Made women's multivitamin (50 +) , in the morning with a substantial breakfast, and I like how they give me an extra boost of subtle energy, vitamin C, plus all the B vitamins. You may have to check with your doctor to make sure this is the right vitamin formula for you, but I really like it.",
