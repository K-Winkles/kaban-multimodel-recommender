If that isn\u2019t enough, we also boost our supplements with proprietary blends of organic fruits, vegetables and botanicals for an extra source of real whole food nutrition. Like organic broccoli, carrots, blueberries, kale, spinach, heart healthy turmeric, immune boosting mushrooms\u2026 we could go on and on and on.... Naturelo... from Nature with Love",

                "reviewText": "I must say..these multivitamins are pretty good. I've just about finished my first bottle of 120 capsules (30 day supply) and I feel great. I was skeptical at first, especially with the higher-than-most cost, but as with any product, you just have to take the risk and experience it for yourself. Ultimately, my wish would be for these to come down to a lower price point, allowing for a more affordable monthly subscription. Also, 4 Capsules was too much for me to take at once so I split them into 2 doses (two in the morning with breakfast, and two in the evening with Dinner)When I first started consuming these, I couldn't tell if they were working at all, I didn't feel much of a change, but I knew that since these are derived from organic whole foods, that I would need to give them ample time to kick in. I was also afraid that when they finally did kick in, that I would feel a sudden high and then crash hard, but that was not the case with these. About 2 weeks in, I started to feel the effects; I noticed that I slept better throughout my nights, I woke up refreshed, the grogginess that I usually experience during the day has diminished and it has even improved my memory, stamina & endurance. Another observation...these don't turn my urine dark yellow, which I assume means that my body is actually absorbing the nutrients as opposed to discarding them as excess waste.What else can I say? Overall, I am happy with them and am willing to give it another go. Hopefully, combining these with a healthier diet / lifestyle + daily exercise should yield some very positive results for me in the near future.That's all for now!",

                "reviewText": "I am someone who hates to eat my vegetables. My diet is missing all the vitamins vegetables offer and I have noticed in my life that I am not healthy. I get headaches every week and I get sick at least once a month which really slows me down at work.I've taken vitamin pills once before from Garden of Life until the bottle was empty and I didn't notice any difference other than my urine turning a bright yellow color. So I stopped taking pills for a while and tried to have a more balanced diet. It didn't work, those darn vegetables are the worst! So here I am now giving the vitamin pill a chance again.I've done some research this time and this product caught my eye. I have used this product for 2 months now and I have absolutely fell in love with it. It simply just works for me, my body welcomes it and I haven't had any side effects that was other than good. My first day using it, I felt more focused, happier and more energetic. It was a very night to day feeling. I was absolutely bamboozled by the affect. After a week of continues use, I felt better and better and noticed that I was being more productive at work (writing code faster with less design flaws). After using this product for a month I actually told my friends about it and had to tell them the good news of something that works for me.. I felt as if this company deserves to pay me for advertising this product. After two months I can happily say that I have not had any illness or headaches in the past 2 months! No need for that life destroying advil! This past week my boss mentioned how strange it is that I haven't been sick for the past 2 months.. This is what made me write this review, if there are others that are like me, going through similar things as me, this might be the product for you!Other mentions. Not sure if it is due to this product but ever since I've been taking these pills, I've had less acne on the skin on my back, chest and shoulders (luckily I don't have acne on my face). Also, I've had frequent canker sores that were very painful that would last more than 2 weeks at a time. I haven't been having that issue anymore since the pill. That is all, hope if you decide to try it that it will work wonders for you too.Thanks naturelo for a product that works for me!",

                "reviewText": "I started taking this Whole Food multivitamin after looking for something better than the normal branded multivitamin that i usually buy each month. I was looking at a more 'Natural' multivitamin and this came on top time and time again from other reviews, it was praised for the high quality ingredients and review after review stated people noticed a huge difference in their health and well-being. After using Naturelo Whole Food multivitamins for over a month now i can honestly say i understand what they are talking about as i feel more alert, i have more energy and i have found i don't need to take a mixture of supplements as these 4 a day capsules (2 at Breakfast and 2 with Dinner) have everything you need in them.One of the things that i noticed was the quality of vitamins and minerals in these capsules, they are the most bio available and exactly what your body craves for. The difference with this multivitamin is that they use the best possible ingredients available for example Folate (as Quarefolic) this form is ready for your body to use to repair damaged DMA and doesn't need converting unlike folic acid which an estimated 50% of the population can't convert, Methylcobalamin as B12 for energy, along with natural Vitamin C (Organic Acerola Cherries) and natural Magnesium.One of the other things I noticed about this multivitamin is that it also contains a Organic Fruit and Vegetable Blend along with added extras like Rutin, Lycopene, Lutein and Astaxanthin all of with are excellent for maintaining healthy eye sight. I am a firm believer that you are what you eat and i will continue using Naturelo for this reason, I only want to consume natural things that have not been modified in labs, just read other reviews of this fantastic product. For what you get in this product verses the cost it is a absolute bargain.",

                "reviewText": "Was looking for a product that could provide all of the essential nutrients and vitamins for the active male as I weight train 3 - 5 times/week without the excessive additives that most vitamin companies add to there product. More importantly and impressively, Naturelo uses strictly whole foods as the source to provide the daily value essential nutrients when taking 4 tabs a day. The process and labor to accomplish this far exceeds the cost/bottle than big pharma companies mass producing synthetically made vitamins. But it is more than justified, as the challenge to consume via food would be simply impossible on a daily basis. It would be cool to witness and see from inception to completion how this product is made.Since Taking this Product (December 2018)- Not one case of Colds or Flu (December 2019, all 4 of my family members had severe stomach flu with close contact/high exposure 5 days straight with no inherited symptoms)- Increased Energy Levels- Significant reduction in recovery periods- Improved DisgestionNote: I eat about 4-6 meals/day with 5 L/day of water consumption and an average of 4-6 hours of sleep/night, and 6 grams of Naturelo Omega 3 intake/per day.",
