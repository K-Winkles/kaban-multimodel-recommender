I had other gummy type supplements & vitimans packed as well that did not melt at all. These ones apparently can't withstand heat like that. Understandable, but I just hadn't thought about it. So word to the wise keep these away from heat that is more than normal... granted a car in the sun gets very hot but im am unsure what temperature they melted at. When we got back into the car it was hot but not so hot that we couldn't get in.",
