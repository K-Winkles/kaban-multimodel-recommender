It is necessary for calcium and phosphorus absorption to build and maintain strong bones and teeth, provide immune system support, and for healthy muscle function.* Can\u2019t You Get Vitamin D From the Sun? Often referred to as the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d vitamin D3 is synthesized when bare skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) light. However, studies show that most people do not get the recommended amount from sunlight alone. Factors that can inhibit vitamin D3 production include the time of day sun exposure occurs, season, latitude, skin color, age, clothing, and sunscreen use. In fact, according to Mayo Clinic, 25% to 50% or more of the general population may be vitamin D deficient. NatureWise Vitamin D3 delivers the same biologically active form of vitamin D produced in the body as a result of direct sunlight -- without the risk of unprotected UVB exposure. Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency Bone pain and brittleness, muscle weakness, and tiredness can all indicate a deficiency in vitamin D. People who may be at higher risk for deficiency include those who spend a lot of time indoors, have darker skin pigmentation, are elderly, or overweight. Our Vitamin D3 is Third Party Tested for Quality, Purity, and Potency NatureWise Vitamin D3 contains 100% natural, USP grade, non-GMO, certified organic olive oil. Our vitamin D3 is made following strict GMP standards. We utilize specialized ISO 17025 third party laboratories to test for physical, chemical, and microbial contamination. potency, and safety.

                "reviewText": "A little over a year ago, I had to quit taking the gel caps due to an esophageal stricture, caused by a sliding hiatal hernia/acid reflux. This was so hard on me. I never found anything that took the place of these excellent vitamin D3 gel caps. I would give some to my husband, then forget. Recently I noticed my husband sneezing a lot (and it's not allergy season). I looked at our bottle of vitamin D3 (I always loved the 5,000 IU amount), and I gasped. They were waaaay outdated. So I ordered a new bottle of these Naturewise D3. Wow! For one thing the bottle is smaller but there are still 90 capsules. When I took one of the gel caps out of the new bottle, I noticed it seemed to be slimmer and I wondered if I could swallow it. Yay! I CAN SWALLOW IT! I put one side by side with one of the older ones. The new one looks more elongated and thinner, but like it has the same amount of content. Because of this thinner design, I am able to easily swallow the new ones. Now I'm going take one *every* day, and give it to my husband too. We are retired and I've noticed we've seemed weaker with less energy. I'm thinking that now, after starting to take this wonderful vitamin D3, once again, we will be faring much better. My husband has gout attacks and most of the things that have vitamin D in it, he can't take. He's also less mobile, so he doesn't get outside as much. So I'm hoping these will give us much of our vitality back and take away our sneezes and runny noses, as well as making my husband less pale. I'll get back, once we've been taking these again for about a month. I would highly recommend this vitamin D3 supplement by this amazing company. And my thanks to the makers for making it easier to swallow!.. Oh and the price of 90 capsules is amazing, for such a high quality supplement! You can't go wrong, here. This from a woman who takes most of her supplements in liquid form. Happy buyer, here:)",
