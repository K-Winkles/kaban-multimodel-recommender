As a parent, finding a product that combines fun, flavor, and wellness is like striking gold, and these gummies hit the mark.First off, the taste is a big win. My child is quite picky, but these gummies have been a game-changer. She looks forward to her 'special treat' every day without any fuss, which is a relief.What really sets these gummies apart is their effectiveness. I've noticed a visible uplift in her mood and overall demeanor. It's like these gummies add a little extra sunshine to her day, making her more resilient and cheerful.The natural ingredients list gives me peace of mind, knowing I'm not compromising on health for convenience. It's comforting to have a product that supports her emotional well-being without any artificial nasties.",

                "reviewText": "We die hard love these vitamins. We\u2019ve tried everything straight through to GI appointments and medication to help my daughter have regular bowel movements her entire life but nothing worked consistently or in healthy ways. Finally we started her on these! The first time we gave her two (she\u2019s a tiny four year old) her poop was green, so we knew maybe it needed a minute to process in her system so we pulled back to one a day. Soon she was pooping every day or other day. Even with one a day if she starts going on day three or almost day four without poop, we just start giving her two of these vitamins a day and within 24 hours she\u2019s back on track! Seriously I can\u2019t live without these now, it saved us from having to always give her Doctor prescribed Miralax causing bathroom accidents and being so stopped up we have to go to urgent care- so far after not even finishing one bottle I haven\u2019t felt a single nerve about her bowels. So so grateful for these vitamins. They also taste amazing she\u2019s had zero complaints. We emptied them into this beautiful unicorn container I ordered separately (like a metal screw on thermos type) and call them \u201cunicorn dots\u201d and whether she needs one or two that day she is happy to down them after breakfast! Thank you for designing these!",
