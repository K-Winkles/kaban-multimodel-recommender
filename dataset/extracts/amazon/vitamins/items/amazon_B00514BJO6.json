Vitamin D in slightly higher dosage are especially helpful and beneficial to those who doesn\u2019t get much sunlight. The softgels are just tiny, which is very easy to swallow. It doesn\u2019t smell bad and leaves no undesirable aftertaste. They\u2019re also easier to absorb than tablet forms as they are made in soft gels form.I highly recommend this effective Vitamin D, and brand to others as this is definitely worth the asking price.",

I went with this brand and dose as I have used them before and I didn't want to over dose on the amount I take a week by getting a larger dose. They are not too big to swallow and I've not noticed any taste. The vitamin D I was using before these came, didn't seem to be doing anything. The times I have used these, they seem to be good. They are more expensive than other brands, but then there are 250 in the bottle and as I say, they seem to be doing their Job.Update. I have been tested again for vitamin D deficiency and my level was ok. So they obviously work well.",
