They also make me feel good, as they provide 18 essential nutrients for my overall wellness. I notice that I have more energy and better skin since I started taking them. They are also gluten-free and vegan-friendly, which is important for me. I would highly recommend these gummies to any woman who wants to boost her health and happiness. They are a tasty and healthy treat.",

Multivitamins do not come small enough to fit in a little weekly pill container. I kept forgetting to take my daily multivitamin until I found chewable gummy ones. After searching for ones that both don't taste like grass, are easy to chew and have the daily vitamins and minerals I need. I also really like the addition of folic acid and biotin; my moods as well has my hair and nails have gotten noticeably better.",

I have tried many multi vitamins and the pills make me nauseous and alot of gummies have a nasty taste or weird consistency. these have neither. they are easy to chew and taste great. It almost makes you want to eat more which is impressive for a vitamin. my husband takes the mens vitamins i take the womens and i even bought the kids and teen ones for my children. i added them to my subscribe and save since i buy them often anyway. hope that helps. as for how well the vitamins actually work i have no idea because i have been taking vitamins for years and im not sure if you are supposed to physically feel any different lol.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write reviews, unless it\u2019s for an absolutely terrible product, but I wanted to share my 6 month experience with these Olly chewable vitamins.Initially, the taste of the Women\u2019s chewable multi gummy was eh. Kinda fruity but I can tell it\u2019s a vitamin. The smell is NOT fruity and it\u2019s not pleasant(smells like how a typical vitamin tastes if it stays on your tongue too long before you swallow it lol) As time went on the taste has become better, the smell tolerable, and I just think of them as my healthy morning fruit snack.I haven\u2019t taken them consistently over 6 months, I\u2019ll run out and forget to order more for a week or two and sometimes forget to take them for a day or two. But overall, my skin, hair and nails are much happier. The most significant sign of any change has been my hair. It falls out less during washings and with brushing, and I can tell it\u2019s growing back thicker around my hairline. My nails are growing back faster (but not really thicker/stronger) and my skin is less dry.During the summer my order from Amazon came melted, and on another shipment the ice pack they include to prevent the gummies from melting had opened up everywhere. After those instances, I now order directly from the Olly website and haven\u2019t had any issues.I have used their Collagen rings twice during this 6 month period and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s also contributed to my hair and nail growth. The collagen gummies are only a 2 week supply, I wish you could order a 30 day supply. I\u2019ve also used their glowing skin gummies for a month. The tastes and smells of those two gummies are also in the fruity but still vitamin-y category for me. However, it\u2019s a vitamin, not candy. I\u2019m not expecting something sweet.I have also taken their probiotic/prebiotic gummy everyday over the past 4 months, and it has seemed to help regulate everything in my GI tract. (These actually taste and smell great)As someone else mentioned, the Women\u2019s multi gummy does not include iron, which is a bummer, since iron is important for women \ud83d\ude43Overall I\u2019m happy with these Women\u2019s multi gummies due to my hair regrowth, but I\u2019m sure there is a comparable alternative that is less expensive.",
