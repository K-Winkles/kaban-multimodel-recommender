                "reviewText": "I had major vitamin deficiencies as an adult. My internist told me to take two of these every day. Within just a few months, my deficiencies were resolved, and I was feeling better. These are easy to swallow and definitely effective. They did not upset my stomach like many vitamins for adults. They are chewable for folks who have trouble swallowing large pills. They also have much higher vitamin levels than their gummy counterparts. I do wish the flavor was a bit better. I seem to recall these vitamins tasting much better even five or ten years ago, but I read something online about a change in the way they were made, which may have affected their taste. They are a bit expensive compared to some other brands, but I've ended up continuing to use them because they have not bothered my stomach and are definitely working.",

I had too much iron and was switched to these without the added iron and unfortunately, I don't feel like I have my little sweet piece of candy every morning anymore. These Flintstones are not as flavorful as the others, but are still edible, so I can't knock them too much. My vitamin levels are good, so they must be doing the job!",
