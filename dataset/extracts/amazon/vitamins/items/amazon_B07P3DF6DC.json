                "reviewText": "Vitamins are the most important part of your diet. If you're like me and barely eat the recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables in a whole week, then you better take your vitamin game seriously. First off is the flavor. These things taste better than those oreos you've been eating instead of your veggies. I mean if you're in the market for vitamins, then you obviously base your diet around whether it tastes good or not. I mean no disrespect to flintstone gummies, but these just might be even better than the reigning vitamin king. They are even easily chewable and easy to swallow which is pretty lit. Now taste doesn't mean anything for a vitamin if its not good quality but let me tell you something. This multivitamin got the whole vitamin gang in it. I'm not just talking about vitamins A, C, D, and E. These bad boys got the whole vitamin alphabet packed inside. When I started taking these vitamins I was a skinny, unhealthy teen, but after a few years of chugging these janks, I'm a whole different person... I'm a healthy, slightly less skinny teen and I've even gained 5 lbs of straight muscle since taking these things. The only concern I have is the pricing. They say to take one a day, but the bottle is $13.92. So that means I have to almost $14 just for one day of vitamins. But like I said they said they taste amazing so downing 170 vitamins every day is no problem. Honestly I don't even mind paying that much for vitamins, because these are simply the best (again no offense flintstones). All in all, if you take vitamin shopping seriously, then you NEED to get these gummies. They are just on a whole other level than any other vitamins out there. I've never felt more like a man than after eating these bad boys. Peace out my fellow vitamin loving homies.",
