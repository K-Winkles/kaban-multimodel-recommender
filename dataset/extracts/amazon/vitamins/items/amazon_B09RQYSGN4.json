With sun exposure, the body has the ability to produce Vitamin D from the skin. However, most people do not produce enough due to many factors.+ 95% of Americans do not consume enough Vitamin D from their diet alone (1). If you\u2019re the indoorsy type who gets less than 15-30 minutes of direct sunlight per day, or if you don\u2019t consume a variety of foods that contain Vitamin D (fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified milk) then a dietary supplement with Vitamin D3 may help increase your intake.

Published 2020 Jun 10. doi:10.3390/nu12061735. Vitamin D aids in the absorption of Calcium, to support teeth and bone health. It also helps your immune health. And Nature Made supplements are made with Vitamin D3, which is the body\u2019s preferred form of Vitamin D.

                "reviewText": "Well, I\u2019m definitely prone to needing to supplement my vit D and these are wonderful. Because I consistently run low in vitamin D \u2014as I work in radiology and often work in dark cave like rooms\u2014 I decided that taking daily higher doses would benefit me. I love the 10000iu dose and this brand is very clean and a good source! My doctor use to prescribe me 50000iu a week for several months at a time \u2014 so when I start to get super low \u2014 I just take this 5x\u2019s a week for a month or two then back off to one a week. This is great for people who are terrible at taking daily vitamins as the dose is higher. Since vit D is fat soluble it\u2019s difficult to ever take too much. These are also very small and in a veggie capsule so they are very easy to swallow! You don\u2019t have to live like a vampire\u2014 take your vit D!",
