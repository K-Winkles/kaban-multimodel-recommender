Also, if you tried to eat the daily amount of food required to equal what is in our delicious product, it would not only be physically impossible.

I finally ran away. I lived on the streets of Amsterdam as a 10- year-old for 4 years trying to survive. In December '64 I came to America on a green card. I started taking handfuls of hard-to-swallow vitamin pills to overcome my wellness challenges from malnutrition. I learned that due to poor absorption the vitamin pills didn\u2019t work for me. I studied nutrition for 15 years and created this amazing tasting liquid product to improve my own body. It worked for me so I decided to share it with the world. It's been my mission to turn my tragic beginning into a story of reinvention and hope by combining the 2 things I lacked in life \u2013 good nutrition & someone to care. A portion of the vitamin profits help fund our children\u2019s charity. Charles Founder & Creator",

Fair price. I don't understand those who claim it tastes bad or too sweet. To me it tastes like orange sherbet ice cream. Thank you for bringing this to market. I hate swallowing handfuls of pills only to have partial absorbshon. Love that it's Non GMO, or fillers. Mine came in a box and in good condition. No leaks and sealed. If your looking for an easy to take vitamin and mineral supplement give this a try. Great stuff!",
