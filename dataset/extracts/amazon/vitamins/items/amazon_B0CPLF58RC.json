And I\u2019ve started buying most of my vitamins and supplements on Amazon because of the convenience as well as the variety of brands and choices.So when I saw this bottle vitamin E from NatureWise, I wanted to try it. The softgels are just the right size and easy to swallow. And the bottle comes with 60 softgels so you get a lot of bang for your buck! Very happy customer!",

If you zoom in on one of images, you will see this \u201cOUR MANUFACTURER IS FDA REGISTERED AND CERTIFIED BY 3RD PARTY AUDIT\u201d. I included that Imogen my pictures. These small gel pills contain 1200% of our recommended daily allowance of vitamin E. They are easy to swallow and leave no aftertaste. I like that they are supposed to help with our immune system, especially with so much going around right now, and with stress. I\u2019m sure we all deal with stress. I just started using them so I have not used them long enough to see results yet but I\u2019m looking forward to them.",
