According to the packaging this eye vitamin formula is \"based on 20 years of clinical studies.\" My hope in taking these vitamins is to prevent or slow down AMD (Age Related Macular Degeneration) and possibly Glaucoma. We all get older and our eyesight is precious. The product I bought on Amazon contained a bottle of 120 brown Mini Soft Gels. All the Gels in the bottle were in good condition (not stuck together, and they had no odor). Apparently, they were fresh because there was a long expiration date (21 months away). I've been taking these vitamins for 4 months now, and find this Mini Soft Gel formulation easy to swallow and I have not observed any side effects.",

The inner part of the bottle was stained orange, obviously moisture had entered the bottle. The whole mess was unusable. Obviously the enclosed packet meant to keep them dry did not work. Now I have to work to get a refund, and this is a very expensive medication.",
