                "reviewText": "Bluebonnet, from everything we've been able to gather, manufactures some of the highest quality vitamin/mineral supplements in the United States. I have yet to spot an artificial ingredient. This product, for example, is L-ascorbic acid (natural source), not the D- variety (synthetic).Any company can claim anything they want, and these days most anything in advertising should be suspect, pending further research. But I can find nothing that counters Bluebonnet's claims of sourcing, small batch purchases so that extensive testing for quality and purity can be done, etc.Additionally, Bluebonnet uses amber glass bottles, not plastic containers.In short, without evidence that Bluebonnet is not what they claim to be (and available evidence is quite supportive of their claims), this will remain one of our two almost exclusive brands of supplements. We've used many over the years, and been disappointed eventually with most. Bluebonnet has been one of two favorites for several years, and this product lives up to that reputation. (No, I don't work for them, hold no stock in the company - I think it's privately held anyway - and don't even know anyone that does work for them. I'm just highly impressed with the company, and find that our results with the products are excellent.)",

                "reviewText": "I have used Bluebonnet products for a very long time. Years ago the manager of a health food store that I had patronized introduced me to the Bluebonnet brand. He recommended it very highly. He was up to date with research, attended conventions and so much more! When he recommended a product I always felt very comfortable with his recommendation. Personally, I have always had excellent results with Bluebonnet. My experience with Bluebonnet supplements in general is that they are really the purest supplements around...so happy to have found Bluebonnet Vitamin C 1000 mg. here at Amazon. Most sincerely, I hope that you will experience the same satisfaction that I have with this product.",

If you care about the supplements you put in your body read the label. This product is one of few that is not a smoke and mirrors camouflage job for cheap, Chinese junk disguised as \"sold by\" not \"made in\" USA. I am OK with my plastic kids toys being made in China but not anything I eat... or that my dog eats.",
