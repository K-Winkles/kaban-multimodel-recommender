As with anything we decide to intake, if on medication having your physician take a glance at what we\u2019re planning on adding doesn\u2019t hurt. Two things I can say is that, 1st the shipping was fast, bottle clean, vitamins green (not the most pleasant taste, not end of the World) & 2nd the customer service was great, so very pleasant.. I contacted them as per the instructions & received a callback the very next morning. Thank you.P.S. Considering trying one without iron, might work better, as suggested.",

The only thing I don't love is the taste, they're very garlicky tasting but nothing a drink can't handle. Also, for those who are wondering, yes the veggies and probiotics do increase your uh...bowel activity. Lots of gas and a VERY regular schedule. I originally didn't make the connection but everytime I stop taking them and restart, I'm super gassy.",

No. Its 89\u2013 every. single. time. Just weird!",

My husband complained that they bothered his stomach & I just assumed that was just him being overly sensitive. After all, I've taken them (at only 1 a day for years, and both my daughter & I took them through the pandemic with general health improvement. I skip taking them from time to time, but have always got back into the habit because I felt better on them until... this last batch. There has always been color differences between batches, but this time I think whatever made the change effected me poorly. While it's entirely possible my own health has changed (I've always had a bit of a sensitive gut - but these were helping it for years!) now I can't take one without having problems. I've tried holding my other supplements and only taken this one (Others included: a probiotic, Mg, Zinc, Vit B, & Vit E & occasional iron - all of which served me well alongside this MVI until recently), tried going off this one completely, tried just taking my other supplements, & tried other multi-vitamins. And... it's this multivitamin. When I am off it, my gut issues resolve. As soon as I add it back in my gut rebels. I thought it was something else for months, but no. I'm super sad because it worked so well for so long. Now I need to find something else. I get stupid cravings & generalized fatigue without a multi",
