This is a big pill and will absolutely make you nauseas if you don\u2019t eat- I, personally, ate a starch/protein heavy breakfast and then waited an hour after taking the pill. Don\u2019t recommend moving heavy right away or else you get slight vertigo- This pill really boosted my energy a ton! I used to take like 4 hour naps and now I don\u2019t feel the need to take any!- This does make you poop. Haven\u2019t experienced any vomiting but definitely more solid poop which is a 10/10 for me- This is NOT a diet pill. It will not make you lose weight. But this is really good for suppressing appetite. I would constantly need to eat/snack but this really helps.- Good source of Vitamins. Highly recommend.- try to make a routine time for it. ( I take it at 9am everyday ) but I just feel it\u2019s better on the stomach",

With this pill, I feel great and energized all day! I haven\u2019t needed to drink an energy drink since I\u2019ve taking these consistently. Yes it also is helping with my metabolism and I feel more full and don\u2019t have nearly as many sugar cravings while at work. I don\u2019t feel as bloated and I\u2019m better about not over eating. Sometimes it makes me feel a little nauseous if I eat to much. Which is interesting and some people might not like it but for me- I think it\u2019s really teaching me a lesson that I don\u2019t need all those sweets lol. I have the biggest sweet tooth and we alwaaayyyss have treats at work from clients so this is really great for me. Overall, very happy with this vitamin.",

                "reviewText": "I've been taking these for about 2 weeks now. I will say I do get very nauseous here and there, BUT that's only if I thought I ate enough food when I actually didn't, or I just didn't have time to eat. Nothing I didn't expect though, so I can only blame myself. I also find it helps if you let the food digest a little bit. Continue to eat before and after you take the vitamin to avoid as much nausea as possible. I'm a 5'8, 145 pound girl and a granola bar, yogurt, and some type of fruit is more than enough to do it for me.These pills really do help energy too. I have an 8 hour office job that I used to doze on and off throughout the day, but after 2 days of taking these I haven't tried to rest my eyes once (even if I only get a couple hours of sleep). I'd highly discourage taking these at night unless you're a night owl or work a night shift and need to stay up somehow. It's a great replacement for coffee/caffeine.Lastly, I've seen lots of reviews of people saying they're losing weight. I work out 30 minutes a day and eat pretty healthy and haven't seen a drastic difference from when I'm doing the same thing without the pills. That being said, I've only had them for 2 weeks so that may change. All bodies process supplements differently.The only negative thing I have to say about this product besides the extreme nausea is the taste. If I don't swallow it fast enough, the bitter vitamin flavor lingers for a while. They also get stuck in my throat sometimes which is a little painful, but nothing water can't push down. It has more of a dry texture than those smooth gel capsules. Kind of like flinstone vitamins-Other than that, I'm still going to continue to take this for the energy boost and see what else happens from here.",

                "reviewText": "I do not do reviews, but this is my second day taking this vitamin. So, I do not know about getting or feeling nauseated, I've not experienced it. I took one of the reviewers advice and took half instead of whole. Maybe that's why I have not experienced the down side. So, yes, I take half with my food and the other half after I finish eating. Once I took the my second half on my first day of taking it, I have soooooo much energy and I do not have the hunger pains or wanting to munch all the time. I just love the fact that my energy level is up. I'm not sluggish nor sleepy. I guess I needed this type of vitamin for my metabolism. I'm soooooo happy with the results already. I do believe it curbs my appetite and have me drinking more water.I'm sure it will support me in my exercise routines.",
