                "reviewText": "It seems like it is now surprisingly difficult to find a men's multivitamin with lycopene in it (and it is not as easy as it used to be to find lycopene alone). So I was happy to see that this multivitamin had at least a little lycopene (although not as much as most standalone lycopene supplements, if you can find them). Furthermore, it is vegetarian friendly -- it uses vegetable-based pectin, not animal-based gelatin to form the gels -- which may be important to some.These gummies are not as chewy as other gummies (like fiber gummies, for example). In other words, they're closer to a soft plastic than a rubber. But they have a good taste, and they chew very easily. I don't notice any digestive problems after taking two of them in the morning, even if I do not eat anything with them. For a vitamin with lycopene in them, I think the value is pretty decent too. So I will continue to buy these as my daily multivitamin.",

                "reviewText": "I have used Natures Way products for years. My other vitamin regimen and supplement health needs are mostly Life Extension products. I use the Natures Way gummy chews as my daily multi vitamin because my concern is at my age I want a daily multi vitamin to be absorbed and utilized by my body as much as possible. So I refrain from hard compressed tablets that may not be fully absorbed by your body with portions of the vitamin passing through with your waste. I take Natures Way chews or the protein/vitamin drink M-F and no vitamins or supplements on the weekend. I do this so that any vitamins wont over accumulate in my body.",
