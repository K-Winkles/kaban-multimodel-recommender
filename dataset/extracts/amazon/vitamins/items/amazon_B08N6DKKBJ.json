Can't find it in my local stores anymore. They are all a little different and our stores just carry the 50+ one now, but I'm not there yet, hee. When I take this daily my hair is healthier, my skin feels healthier, even my immune system can outlast the kids' that are fighting off stuff around me. I highly recommend this specific ALIVE vitamin (and the pill one, not the gummie bc they have different amounts of things in them).Like everything else since 2020, I have noticed that the bottle has stayed the same (size & look) yet it comes with less pills now :\\ but nothing you can do about that.",
