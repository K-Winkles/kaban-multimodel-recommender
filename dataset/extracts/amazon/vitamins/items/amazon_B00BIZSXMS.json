I recently started taking them and I was wowed by how effective they are. The pills are large, but somehow easy to swallow and I have always struggled with swallowing pills. They do smell and taste pretty bad, but I got over that pretty fast. I get plenty of energy from these to the point it's like I'm a teenager again. And the best part is the price - you can't beat it. 1000% recommended to anyone who is looking for a decent multivitamin!",

Also, the \u201ccancer\u201d warning bottles are for California\u2019s BS. Some bottles have the warning while others don\u2019t. Those that do can be sold in California, those that don\u2019t are sold to all other normal states.. As for the taste, it\u2019s not a big deal. Some people are just dramatic about it. If I let it sit on my tongue for a few seconds I can taste it. But, if I toss it in and drink it down you can\u2019t taste it at all. If you want a good quality vitamin buy it.",

                "reviewText": "These seem to be a decently priced multi. I notice they digest well and don\u2019t turn my pee bright yellow, so I think it\u2019s a good product. However, anywhere you carry these, other than in the bottle, they will make smell like pee. Seriously, I\u2019ve taken supplements, protein powders, drinks, etc; for years, and I\u2019ve never had anything that not only smells this strong, but also makes the area around it smell pervasively like urine. I tend to put my pills in an organizer and keep it in my counter in the bathroom. I kept thinking someone was peeing on the floor. Finally realized it\u2019s the pills. Put the medicine sorter in my car and people started asking me if an animal had been trapped inside. The smell seems to stay in the bottle if you keep them in the bottle, but if you put them in an organizer or a ziplock to take with you, the entire room or area you keep them in will smell like pee. Just making you aware. I discounted the other comments. They were right.",
