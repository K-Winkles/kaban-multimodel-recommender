                "reviewText": "Hello Amazon Friends!EDIT 3/10/23: As promised, I am writing whether these supplements are actually 90 capsules in each set. NO! In this second set, I had one (1) extra vegetable capsule and two (2) extra fruit capsules.Now it is confirmed\u2026Simply Nature\u2019s Promise has no quantity control measures in place. You may get extra, may not. There will not be the recommended amount to take at the end of each/either bottle. I want you, Amazon Friends, to know this before deciding to purchase. I wish you well\ud83e\udde1These supplements ain\u2019t cheap but are reasonably priced compared to similar products offered. I purchased this set but did not start taking them for a day or two. Just a side note\u2026I took three vegetable and three fruit capsules as directed every day. Well, Tuesday, February 7, there were two vegetable and one fruit capsule left. Doing the math, I was missing the proper serving for 30 days.I wanted to contact the seller directly because they are a small business. I believe and support small businesses and did not want to write this in a public forum.If this happens to all, and one, two, or three capsules are missing, this company will be making a lot of money very quickly. The customers will be losing out and broke.Regarding taste\u2026I strongly suggest taking the vegetable capsules, as directed, with a lot of water but eating just a bit. If you take the vegetable capsules on an empty stomach and burp, you will taste every vegetable in those capsules. They may be good for you, but vegetable taste is not great. The fruit capsules taste fine.Another note\u2026I suffer from reflux and, the vegetable capsules, every once in a while, cause a little burning in my esophagus. This is why I suggested eating a little something with the vegetable capsules. I take vegetable in the morning and fruit at night. If you take fruit in the morning and vegetable at night, I still suggest putting a little something on your stomach along with the vegetable capsules. JIC\u2026Overall, my only real complaint is being shorted capsules out of both the vegetable and the fruit bottles. Other than that, I do feel better, have more energy, and am not as hungry before taking this supplement. That being said, this is my experience. They are not an appetite suppressant, and I am not taking them for that reason. I am merely stating how this supplement is making me feel.As I wrote, I have one complaint. That complaint can potentially become a problem however, I just received my second set of capsules. I will edit once I get to the bottom of these bottles and let you know what is what.I wish you well Amazon Friends!",
