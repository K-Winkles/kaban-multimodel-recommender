Your multivitamin can come in many shades of gold. Our soy-free Vitamin E, a nutrient that provides antioxidant support against free radicals, comes from Buenos Aires, Argentina and can have natural, seasonal color variability from lot to lot.* What kind of testing do you do? Each batch is tested for identity, purity, strength, & composition, so we can be sure that what\u2019s on the label is what\u2019s in the capsules. We also use a 3rd party lab to test each batch for heavy metals, microbes, allergens, and other contaminants. What makes Essential Prenatal different from other prenatal? 12 nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy, in cleanest & most absorbable forms including Omega-3s DHA from algae, gentle chelated Iron, & methylated Folate. All in two citrus-scented, delayed-release capsules designed to be easy on your stomach. Is Essential Prenatal eligible for FSA/HSA/HRA reimbursement?

Before I was taking One A Day recommended by my OB but it had a terrible fishy after taste that made me nauseous. They do have an after taste of citrus so if that is not a flavor profile you like I would not recommend. Be sure to read the back because two tablets is the recommended daily dose, for a while I was just taking one pill a day. They are also easy to swallow despite their size.",

                "reviewText": "I value aesthetics and when coming across this brand I had to try it especially after comparing it to other options and I'm glad I did, its so elegant and unique and to me that couples in value within the entire sensory experience while caring for my health. I personally bought this version which is a prenatal vitamin yet I am using it as my daily essential multivitamin despite not being pregnant - I am sharing this as it is part of the critique and I hope that the seller will consider this as well: 1) the essential every day option is flavored with mint and mint makes me nauseous so I chose this citrus-flavored one 2) when comparing the essential option with this one, this one has more beneficial ingredients and at high percentages so on a cost analysis level, this seems more effective and fiscally efficient. I share this to suggest that the seller either make a non-mint flavored essential option and to also consider increasing their percentages to make an essential vitamin option for non-pregnant women, otherwise I will be buying this prenatal version. This is not health advice and please do your own research but to me, out of both the seller's options, this one seemed better to go with. My photos gives a size comparison and also more details/an example of what the pills look like - beautiful little golden tubes slightly scented citrus, how lovely! The scent is subtle and fades quickly and I also think its wise to realize and make sure you take the full serving daily - 2 capsules, not one a day. For that reason, it might not be the most lucrative and I wish the seller could make this into a once daily serving because to me, why the need to have 2 pills instead of making it into one? Also, while this is a slight annoyance rather than a critical review that should sway your opinion on the product's quality, as I care about presentation, I was shocked they slapped the barcode sticker there and how difficult it was to remove - I had to use soap and scrub off. I'm glad I took the time as now the bottle is pretty...for how much this costs and how they seem to focus on beauty, I'm surprised they didn't think of placement and to make removing the stickers easier for their customers. To me this matters as I wanted to buy this as its one of the prettiest bottles I've seen and I plan to reuse the same bottle for storing future purchases, on top of the supposed/claimed health benefits. I just received and started using so it'll be too early to review for the true absorbency or effectiveness but they were easy to swallow and an overall pleasant experience and well-rounded for women's health, whether you're pregnant or like me, using it because I don't like mint and I looked and this version has more percentages of the same things as their regular essential daily multivitamin option. Perhaps this will be helpful for others making a decision or the seller. Either way I am pleased and satisfied and hope for better health for us all - and congratulations and best wishes to all those pregnant and welcoming children into their lives!",

The ordering process was seamless, and the package arrived promptly, which was a great start.While these vitamins are designed with prenatal support in mind, they offer a comprehensive blend of nutrients that are beneficial for anyone looking to maintain overall health. The inclusion of Folate and Choline is particularly noteworthy for neural support, even for those not expecting. The Omega-3 DHA component is a great addition for cognitive well-being, and the Iron and Calcium-Helper D3 & K2 contribute to robust health and vitality.Being Non-GMO and vegan-friendly ensures that these vitamins align with various dietary preferences and quality standards. The citrus essence is a delightful touch, making the capsules easy to consume without any lingering aftertaste.My mom has been incorporating these Ritual Prenatal Vitamins into her daily routine for a month now and has already noticed positive changes in her energy levels and overall well-being. I would highly recommend these vitamins to anyone seeking a high-quality, comprehensive supplement to support their health journey.",

Originally I was confused why this bad fish flavor was apprering in my mouth, then did some tests following what in doing in my day to day activities. Without fail, this bad fish flavor occurs when taking these pills. I'll still buy, because it's accordingly the \"best of the market\" but I will have a lot of gum nearby to mask the flavor. It's increasingly worse when burping. Almost nauseating. Worried they used low quality fish oil.",

I\u2019ve been taking this prenatal for four days now.I noticed that this product makes me have increased saliva production.. so I switched from taking it at night (because the first time I took it I woke up, coughing from the extra saliva) taking in the morning because the extra ladder production decreases by time I go to bed.I don\u2019t have any smelly or fishy burps and I don\u2019t have nausea or stomach issues from this.Smells like citrus and taste lightly citrusy.Update as of 2 weeks later: took the 2 pills in the AM and laid down\u2026 fishy burp came! Gotta take these then walk around, eat, or move so that it doesn\u2019t start to digest too early in the gut.3 weeks after purchase: noticed that when I go to the restroom (#2), it smells like sulfur.. not a great smell but it\u2019s manageable.",

It was the only one that didn\u2019t make me sick and I actually enjoyed the hint of lemon when taking it. It has everything I need in one capsul vs having to take several vitamins. Most others like this taste so bad like the fish oil that I would gag when opening the bottle. Not these. There is a slight hint\u2026 maybe\u2026 but the lemon cuts it so well I barely ever notice it. Most importantly my hair grew INCHES when I took this. Longer than it\u2019s ever grown before. I had to keep a nail clipper in my purse because my nails were so long and healthy. I know a lot of this can be pregnancy related but I also strongly believe these vitamins are magical.",
