                "reviewText": "I usually get these from Costco, but they haven\u2019t had them the last two weeks, and being autoimmune I\u2019m not trying to weaken my immune system. So I found them on amazon for about the same price. So YOINK! Mine now! I hate that it\u2019s taking so long to get. But that\u2019s amazon with their bate and switch delivery dates. They say they\u2019ll deliver on this day. Yay!!! And then if you don\u2019t pay 100% attention when you\u2019re ordering it gets changed to a later date, a \u201cprime delivery\u201d date. I hate that stuff!!! Stop doing that! So much of my stuff has been delayed because of that! I\u2019m paying a lot for two days, I want two days or less. Not prime days. But that\u2019s the worst of it all. The gummies are great. Do they work? Who knows if any of those things work. I STILL get sick. But I bounce out quickly from it. I had the flu this year, one day! So I mean, I\u2019m thanking all the vitamins I\u2019m taking because I\u2019m autoimmune and anemic so that was just awesome! So I\u2019m going to keep taking my vitamin C gummies, and I HATE taking MORE pills, so the gummies are just a fun way to take them.",
