I used to put the Tropical Oasis liquid multivitamin in her apple juice, but she's been on an anti apple juice kick lately, so I've been scrambling to try to find another vitamin. She drinks Pediasure with regular chocolate milk, but I tried to find an extra vitamin she'd take, with not much luck. I crushed Flintstones vitamins with a pill crusher, but if there were any bits that didn't dissolve, it'd be all over. I tried the First Day gummies, she wouldn't touch. Stumbled across these, and since she's a chocoholic, I decided to give it a shot. Whaddya know?? These actually do taste like regular chocolate (the kind you'd use for melting and dipping foods in). No aftertaste, just a bit chewy, but no more chewy than a Hershey's kiss, really. And these are so much cheaper than the First Day or Tropical Oasis!",
