BUT if you don\u2019t breathe while opening the container or putting them in your mouth it\u2019s bareable. the after taste is kinda gross too, but that\u2019s usually the case for any type of vitamin\u2026 so i usually make sure i have something flavorful to eat or drink after to cancel out the aftertaste.",

Wish they were in pill form because that's just easier, but the taste of these isn't too bad (the 2 grams of added sugar certainly help).",

                "reviewText": "My daughter has taken these everyday for about a month and already loves them. The last time I ordered teen gummies they all melted together. These do not. They don\u2019t taste to bad and my daughter isn\u2019t as crabby and tired all the time. Last month I saw an add for these and thought they could help. My daughter gets stressed very easily and can become crabby and extremely tired. She has a lot of school work and that can be too much for a teen girl. She told me she feels less stressed and less exhausted everyday like usually when taking these gummies. Glad something finally helped. They only problem you might have is the taste but I recommend!!",
