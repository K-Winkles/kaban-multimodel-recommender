It's hard to find one prenatal that checks all of these boxes AND tastes relatively good. They are also NSF certified - which is just an extra bit of peace of mind since multivitamins are not FDA regulated.",

                "reviewText": "I am not one to leave reviews normally but I have been taking these prenatals for two months now and in general I like them. They seem to be doing what they're supposed to. I usually prefer gummies or chewables to pills and these do have a good flavor and texture but the flavor is also very strong; like there's too much citrus flavor or sugar. Which can be a lot when you are taking four in a serving. I usually spread them out over the morning after eating so they don't upset my stomach. I'm not sure I will be able to keep them down or bring myself to eat them if I am in any way nauseous though.Also, because these don't contain any iron or calcium, I take both along with these which is quite a handful of vitamins to take each morning. Not the end of the world but it might be nice to not have to take as many.Other than the strong flavor, the biggest annoyance with these in my mind is that the count in the bottle is always one short. I started a subscription and am running out before the next bottle arrives. I am giving it one more month to try it but might just switch to a one a day pill in the end anyway.",

                "reviewText": "All the vitamins and DHA are great however these would be easier to take if they were less sweet.. it is difficult to eat because of this. Maybe have a low or no sugar option.They end up stuck together in the bottle which likely means it is being improperly stored before or during shipment. It becomes difficult to remove the gummies from the bottle to take them. A solution to this would likely be a wider mouth bottle that is shorter and wider instead of being tall..Also I always end up with an odd number of gummies when I get to the end as well. Not sure if it is an exact month supply or if those odd ones are extras.",

                "reviewText": "First of all let me start by saying I rarely do reviews but seeing all the unfair comments led me to feel like I have to....1. Everyone says they taste nasty and I'll admit the first time I got them the taste was so so, but not as bad as some are making them out to be. They are a gummy and a natural one, so don't expect a fake over flavored sugary gummy. They take some getting used to. I put mine in the refrigerator and they are a lot better cold, and especially right after eating your morning meal. Remember you aren't doing this for a sweet treat, you're doing this for your health and your babies health.2. My blood work was phenomenal so I know they are doing what they are supposed to be doing3. If it's best for baby and Mama then nothing else should matter.4. Since Amazon's distribution keeps changing the price, don't blame SmartyPants....blame the distributor.You can get these Organic prenatals at Target now, same with the men's organic multi gummy.5. I have NEVER got an expired bottle, not even close.Overall.. I would say with all the benefits and thought they have put into this gummy its well worth a few seconds to chew and swallow. I researched other brands for hours and kept coming back to this one.Would I recommend it? Heck yes.Does my Doc office? Yes, and the even have it in their office..... so you make the choice but be cautious on overly negative reviews....Best of luck Mama's!",
