The vitamins it has is great formula and my kids like theirs. For me it felt like taking 6 gummies was a bit excessive. So I do 3 in the morning & 3 evening. I also felt like they were too sweet for me. I'm taking them to match the kids and might order again. I wish they would make them bigger so you could take less and make them with less sugar.",
