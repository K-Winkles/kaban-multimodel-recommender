                "reviewText": "Be sure to check the oils used in this Nature Bounty product for those who have research as I have and understand the ratio of omega 3 and omega 6 oils in the body. Nature Bounty is a good product. I have used Nature Bounty D3 2,000 IU daily. Use this D3 10,000 IU with caution as the ingredients are Safflower Oil, Vegetable Glycerin Oil, and Sunflower Oil which are Omega 6 Oils.Too much Omega 6 in your body causes inflammation and health issues. The instructions on this bottle state to take daily and that it is for short term therapy for Vitamin D deficiencies. I decided for me to take 1 supplement weekly. When I begin supplementing with Vitamin D, my D levels were 10.5, critically low. I took Nature Bounty 2,000 IU and I doubled the amount to 4,000 IU, then tripled it to 6,000 IU then quad tripled to 8,000 IU and my D level elevated to 47.5. This is much better, but D levels should be between 80-100 per medical doctor's advice.Monitor your D levels with your physician when taking any Vitamin supplement, as I do so that you do not go over the 100% limit. The reason is that too much vitamin D can cause toxicity in the body. I hope this helps you to make a wise choice. Always look at the back of the label before purchasing any vitamin supplement product, especially if you have seafood allergies, as some supplements contain seafood ingredients such as shrimp, lobster and shellfish, and always monitor your vitamin levels with your physician.",

                "reviewText": "I started taking 2 of these tablets a day per dr instructions. Previously I was taking 8000 ius a day and blood work indicated I was severely deficient in vitamin D. (I have Crohn's disease so I don't absorb nutrients well.)Now I take 20,000 ius a day. I haven't had new blood work but I can tell a difference. My anxiety and mild depression seem to have improved a lot since I've upped this dosage. Will be interested to see how the next blood work turns out.",
