                "reviewText": "I'm over 50 and keep fit by working out 5 days a week and staying active. I eat fairly well and was taking a superfoods gummy everyday but given that I do eat fruit and veggies daily, I wasn't sure that was necessary so I decided to look into a regular vitamin, preferably geared towards my age group. I saw these and Centrum is a well known brand, so I decided to give it a shot.I haven't been taking them long so not sure how well they work, but I haven't had any sensitivity to them and they taste ok. Not super sweet like some I've had, which is a good thing. When they say gummy though, they mean it. The texture is much like a gummy bear. Most gummies I take aren't quite like that but it's not a bad thing. They aren't very big and are easy to chew and swallow. It states to take 2 a day but I'm currently only taking one. I like the fact that they don't have additional iron as it is not something I need and so many vitamins add that. It does have Biotin though and I find that to be mostly wasteful. Majority of people get enough in their food and your body will eliminate excess via waste so there's no point in taking it unless you have a deficiency. I guess you could say that about most vitamins and minerals though. Regardless, it's a really good value for the money and assuming it makes any difference, I will continue taking. Only time will tell there.",

                "reviewText": "Since I have difficulty swallowing pills, I always try to purchase gummies and chewable tablets. For years Centrium sold a chewable multi-vitamin for women over 50 that was a one-a-day chewable tablet. For some reason they no longer sell those tablets, so I tried theses gummies because they are not covered in sugar. They are like chewing rubber, the flavor is OK but they are difficult to chew. In September I ordered a 2 pack of these vitamins. I finished the 1st bottle and today opened the 2nd bottle, and all the gummies apparently melted enroute and are one solid piece of rubber! I know they didn't melt after I received them, but I should have checked the bottle better. These gummies are not up to Centrum's quality and standards so I have purchased Nature's Way Alive Gummies for Women 50+ and they are far better.",
