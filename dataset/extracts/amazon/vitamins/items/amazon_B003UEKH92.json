                "reviewText": "I just ordered my bottle yesterday.I just received it today and I did read most reviews here before taking it.Some where a little scary for me (upset stomach) reviews. So I took causion and only took a half of it with my dinner instead of the whole tablet.Its been 5 hrs now since I took half and I feel amazing no stomach issues nothing except only dry mouth that is all. I ordered this because I don't eat much (I am a solid woman) but I'm not huge . I absolutely love milk but barely drink it , I don't eat much only mostly once a day (dinner) I do take 3 different meds for my major depressive disorder and again before I took it I did look up on medications interactions to see if there was any with the meds I'm on (all good to go\ud83d\ude0a) my body has a hard time absorbing vitimen D I used to always be put on vitimen C,D pills because they were always low I used to be on iron pills because I am animic also . So far I know it may sound a little crazy but I'm always sleepy no matter time of day to the point I'm sleeping sitting up lol!! (Yes for real) but I'm not sleepy now lol! . And to had I had my gallbladder taken out 8yrs ago but always deal with everything passing through the minute I eat (most cases) some days 1,2 times others 3-5 a day it's crazy but I feel great so I believe this will be the multivitamin I will stick too since it has everything your body truly needs . I never buy at a store because they contain so many other things that aren't so great for your body.So point is this multivitamin is truly a blessing. I know alot of you had stomach issues with it (me one of the lucky ones) but I have always done well with iron , vitimen A,C and D and iron pills . I did eat with it so I had no issues at all just the constant dry mouth but that is minor .So yes this multivitamin is amazing I will keep taking it. And yes it's big but it was so easy to cut (no struggle at all). Will be stay on half tablet for now and see down the line if full pill will benefit but for now half is just rite for me ! \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I love these. But I made the mistake of taking it each night after dinner. Bad idea, I wondered why I couldn't sleep well and would wake up often all night long. I switched to taking them in the days and wow do they provide me with energy to get through the day. I don't even drink energy drinks anymore. The potency of these vitamins is superb and there's plenty of B Vitamins especially so you don't need to slam the energy drinks (which are filled with B Vitamins). I have taken these vitamins daily for 2 weeks now and feel like I've been brought back to life! If you're looking for a vitamin that gives you an extra boost of nutrients to jump start your day with a slow supply of healthy energy, these are for you! They're certainly for me! (Also be sure you can swallow the larger vitamins)",
