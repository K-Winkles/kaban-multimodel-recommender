                "reviewText": "The Vitafusion Gummy Vitamins Multi +Beauty for hair, skin and nails support is a 2 in 1 product. It's a multi vitamin +biotin+Retinol . I love that in comes with a 90 gummy supply. The grapefruit +Lychee flavor is unique and delicious. It is recommended that adults take two gummy vitamins each day. To get the most benefits chew throughly before swallowing. They contain no artificial flavors, no gluten and no high fructose corn syrup. They contain no dairy and no synthetic FD and C dyes. It's enough for a 45 day supply. I would recommend these to others.",

Still giving it 4 stars because they taste good and this is the first time I've had this issue. Amazon should put this in heat insulated packaging.",
