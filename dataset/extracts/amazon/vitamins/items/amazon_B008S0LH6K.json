                "reviewTitle": "Excellent book",
                "reviewText": "My first degree was in Human Biology, and now as an Associate Professor I teach courses on evidence and research methodology. Therefore, I was at first both attracted and sceptical about this book. The title put me off. I would have preferred: Vitamin D: reassessing the evidence.I came to the book familiar with Wishart's science books. I knew he would be readable, courteous, firm, and well referenced. Wishart is well acquainted both with the science and the politics of medicine. He presents the science so that non-technical people can see the point, and technical people can have precision and detail. Wishart is NOT jumping on a bandwagon: he has been researching and writing about the importance of Vitamin D for over seven years. His basic approach, as always, is to follow the evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are contentious and uncomfortable.The first chapter introduces his argument. Chapters 2-12 cover the role of Vitamin D in (2) Alzheimer's, (3) Autism, (4) Asthma and Allergies, (5) Breast Cancer, (6)Colon and Prostate Cancer, (7) Heart disease, (8) Flu and colds, (9)Pregnancy and childhood, (10)Mental Illness, (11) Multiple Sclerosis (12) Chrohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes. His basic thesis is that Vitamin D is needed, in large quantities. It is vitally important in a wide range of biological systems and diseases. For instance, Wishart presents loads of evidence in chapter 2 that high blood levels of Vit D are strongly associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's. The natural level of Vitamin D in people who work outside is 50ng/ml(125nmol/L) This should be the pre-winter target.So, what is the problem? Surely a balanced diet provides all we need?Wishart shows that diet is not sufficient. The main source of Vitamin D is through the influence of sunlight on skin. Everyone is agreed that sunburn is to be avoided, so the exposure needs to be limited and frequent. Dietary supplements are possible, but they work best for those who already have reasonably high body reserves. Wishart is careful to warn that large supplements can be dangerous, unless taken intravenously.So the problem is that we have a generation educated to believe that skin cancer must be avoided by regular use of sunscreen, which blocks the sun and as a consequence prevents the production of Vitamin D. Chapters 13&14 cover this. He explains that sunscreens do help to protect against the less dangerous \"squamous cell carcinoma\" but provide no protection at all for the dangerous kind: \"basal cell carcinoma\". In addition, those with the most exposure to sun are more likely to survive the dangerous cancer, and are less likely to get it!I wish Wishart had gone into more detail on what to do. I immediately stopped using suncream, but will continue to wear a hat and sunglasses. Sunlight is afterall associated with glaucoma and cataracts is it not? I live in Tunisia and walk to work. Before I started using sunscreen two years ago I had become skilled in avoiding prolonged exposure to sun, while tolerating a little reddening.Both sides of the debate agree that burning is bad. Suitable clothing is the best way to avoid that, in unavoidable circumstances such as driving. But how can I avoid burning and blistering on my face? Is there a case for limited sunscreen use? I would also have liked a systematic evaluation of ALL the major components of sunscreens - not just Vitamin E, Titanium derivatives, Nanotechnology, and Oxybenzone. I hope that in the second edition he will answer these questions.Buy this book. Send your doctor a Kindle copy, and catch as much Autumn sunlight as you can. If Wishart is wrong, then he will have only saved you some money. If he is right, then high levels of naturally produced Vitamin D will reduce cancers and boost the immune system.",

                "reviewText": "A well researched book, fully referenced which strongly points to the possibility that vitamin D deficiency may inhibit the body's ability to defend itself against all manner of infections and ailments. Many health authorities around the world are slow to acknowledge this because it flies in the face of the medical advice to keep out of the sun and smother ourselves with sun cream. A good dose of Vitamin D is hard to get from diet whereas a relatively short exposure to the sun provides a big dose. This is how humans have been getting it for thousands of years but modern medicine thinks it knows better. The pharmaceutical industry makes lots of money out of treating things which the body could do itself with adequate levels of Vitamin D. Read it and make your own mind up.",
