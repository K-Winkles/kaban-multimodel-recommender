                "reviewText": "Idk can't really tell anything else other than they tasted like actually sugar coated dots and not sugar coated chemicals.As for if they work, to be totally honest I can't tell if they work but that goes for any multivitamin. Its not like I can tell by a pain stopping, or I feel energy (personally i am naturaly fatigued). I usually am able to tell by how I feel when i get sick.When I don't take multi I get hit hard and it lasts like 5 days and then tapers off over a week, but when I take a multi that works, it will lasts 2 or 3 days and then about a week of tapering off. And it hits like 3/10 with, as opposed to an 8/10 without.As of yet, I haven't gotten sick since ive started these so i can't say. I guess I'll try to keep in mind if I do. Regardless I will keep trying to take these multi till then. Sorry wasn't much help.",
