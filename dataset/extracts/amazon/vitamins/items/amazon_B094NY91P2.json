I contacted Naturelo company regarding the change in color of contents of capsules which appears to be a concern to other customers and got an answer almost immediately and here it is:\"Due to the variations in the soil, the sort of the plant, the climate, the season it was harvested, etc., there is a difference in the taste, smell and color.. This variation is normal and happens with every new batch of multivitamins we make. We do not use dyes, scents, fillers or binders\"So feel confident that you didn't get a batch of bad supplements.",
