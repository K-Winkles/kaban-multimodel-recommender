                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this product. I work in a school setting with all kinds of kids carrying all kinds of germs and I had one cold all last winter. I find these to be a bit overly sweet which led me to try several other brands that I didn't feel worked as well. My only concern and reason for giving a 4 star rating is that I have purchased these at Sam's club previously and saw them offered here at a better price and I could get just the raspberry ones. When they came the best by date wasn't on either of the 2 bottles that I bought and I found that a little suspicious..... the color looked a little off from the last of the ones I had.... maybe outdated?",
