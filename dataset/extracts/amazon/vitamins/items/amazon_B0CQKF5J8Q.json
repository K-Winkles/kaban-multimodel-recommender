Definitely can reuse/repurpose it after using it all. I also love that it's a 3 month supply so I don't have to order every month. Make it's easier for my life for sure. I also like that the pills are super easy to swallow. Sometimes the vegetables capsules can get stuck in my throat or stick together which causes problems for me. So the way they are make it so much easier to take. I like the price that they are , very reasonable for a 3 month supply. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.",

Its always better to find a natural form and this looks like a good one.Apart from the whole source of vitamin C it has rice hull and pullulan which Im not sure where it derives from but I don't think it's natural so I don't know why the ingredients list it as organic pullulan. What I understand about it, is that its not absorbed by the body but the question is why add it? Maybe its there as a preservative but still one a very pure ingredient is worthy of a 5 star.In saying that. I would rather take this than any absorbic acid vitamin C.",

Vitamin C, in particular, helps my healing and skin condition.Food-derived Vitamin C has been shown to be much richer in micronutrients, fiber and even to be better used by the body. It also works with other vitamins to improve their contributions to health.The feature part of the review asked about the taste. I\u2019m not certain what they are looking for. This is a gel cap, there\u2019s basically no taste \u2013 although maybe that was the point? I like the Vitamin C tablets that taste like a sweet tart, but these are gel caps.When I ran across this Vitamin C I decided it was time to give it a try!",

Here's why I think it's truly exceptional: First and foremost, these capsules are incredibly easy to swallow, with no unpleasant aftertaste. This makes incorporating them into my daily routine a breeze.Now, let's talk about the price. It's not just good; it's an incredible value. For the quality and concentration of vitamin C you're getting, it's a real steal. One more thing that's worth mentioning is that whole food vitamin C, like the one in Plant-C, has been shown to be more bioavailable and effective than synthetic vitamin C. So not only are you getting a high-quality product, but it's also more natural and safe for everyday use. In summary, I can't recommend Organic Vitamin C, especially the Plant-C supplement, enough. It's a fantastic way to support your immune system, benefit from antioxidants, and promote overall health. The fact that it's derived from organic fruits and comes at such a reasonable price makes it a no-brainer for me.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good! I've been wanting to get more vitamin-C but ascorbic acid which is synthetic vitamin-C doesn't really work for me. I was excited to see this whole food vitamin-C and thought I would give it a try.I cannot say I have so far felt any benefit from taking it however unlike ascorbic acid, I tolerate this very well with no negative side effects and get no strange aftertaste during or after taking. I really love the quality standards used to make these and will continue to take them. I also like the reasonable price they are offered at. I really think I finally found my go-to vitamin-c with these!",

                "reviewText": "It's great to find an Organic Vitamin C derived from Organic fruit. It may not be ultra high in milligrams, but since it is 100% whole food and not synthetic, it's more bioavailable. They state that 250mg equals four oranges which isn't to shabby. I also appreciate this product is 3rd party tested, GMO free, Soy free, Made in the USA, Sugar Free, Manufactured in a cGMP certified facility, and includes co-factors like Bioflavonoids and Rutin. There are also no additives, no preservatives, or fillers. One bottle provides a 90 day serving unless you take more than one capsule a day. I'm always on the lookout for a high quality C supplement, and this exceeded my expectations by being a whole food, Organic version of Vitamin C.",
