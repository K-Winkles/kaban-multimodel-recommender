Vitamin C is not only an antioxidant that helps support your immune system, but it also increases iron absorption from food and is needed for collagen synthesis to support overall skin health.\u2020 Vitamin C is found in many fruits and vegetables, but according to a study conducted by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2020 almost 1/2 of U.S. adults are not getting enough Vitamin C through their daily food intake. If you just want to make sure you're getting what your body needs, Vitamin C supplements can help. Vitamin C plays an important role in supporting the immune system. As an antioxidant, it helps neutralize free radicals in the body. And it may help aid in iron absorption in the body too. Vitamin C intake can help support a healthy immune system.\u2020",

They taste like sweet n sour citrus and they work wonders on allergy conditions. Chew slowly occasionally putting some under your tongue (trick for instant benefits).Two winters in a row I experimented. First year I used the swallow type pills vitamin C and was sick regularly. The following winter I tried these and had very little illness and when I did catch something, it was noticeably lighter and was over it quicker.I take one with breakfast and if my allergies are bothering me I will take one with dinner. I haven\u2019t had a cold since covid begen but when i get one, I triple dose these and it goes away quickly. It is impossible to take too much C and if you do you just pee it out.

                "reviewText": "Several years ago I read in Consumer Reports about vitamin supplements, that there's little oversight in quality control, not being regulated by FDA, and it's Buyer Beware. They said there are however some testing labs that seem to have a good reputation for unbiased supplement evaluations, and as I recall, the USP label was one of them. So, other factors being equal, I tend to look for this label when I shop for supplements.",
