                "reviewText": "These pills smell SO BAD. Like urine.Within thirty minutes of taking im having terrible \"pee smelling burps\".Sometimes I gag trying to take them.But! These are the real deal. I feel noticeably better within twenty minutes of taking them. To avoid the yucky burps I've been having a scoop of peanut butter before or after I've taken them.If you have an upset stomach from the pills try a piece of toast right before or after taking them.Regardless of the strong smell my entire family is taking these. Because a stinky smell is worth having double the brain power and a lot more energy throughout our day.I've been adding these to my mother's daily regiment as well and she said it makes her feel less pain, (arthritis, rotator cuff microtears, memory fog, and somewhat better sleep). It's not going to cure all but it dang sure is gonna help you out.The price tag is worth the clean ingredients. You only have one body to get you through life, so invest in it with good supplements.",

                "reviewText": "When it comes to a broad-spectrum daily multivitamin, finding a good formula can be a challenge and none of them are perfect. Between what it contains, the amounts of what it contains, and the sources they are derived from, this is about the best you can do unless you are willing to spend quite a lot. As a two a day formula I recommend taking them separately and with food. There is a bit of vitamin burp and taste. I've seen some expensive three a day formulas that are probably better, but that point you might as well put together a comprehensive many pills per day regiment. If you want to keep it simple without breaking the bank, this is a solid choice.",
