Some research also indicates healthy homocysteine levels are correlated with favorable cognitive health. Vegetarians and vegans may have a difficult time getting adequate amounts of this essential vitamin through food alone. The body\u2019s ability to absorb vitamin B12 naturally present in foods becomes less efficient with age.",
