I purchased from UpNourish as I take several of their other supplements and have been very pleased. These are gel tabs and are not small by any means but are easy to swallow. No taste. I didn\u2019t expect to notice a drastic change after just 2 weeks taking them but I swear that my eyes look healthier and have a youthful luster to them.",
