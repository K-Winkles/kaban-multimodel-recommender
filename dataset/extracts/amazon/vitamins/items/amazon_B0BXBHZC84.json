        "description": "Bronson's K2 + D3 provides just the right amount of each essential vitamin to maximize their benefits to your bones and heart. No more, no less. Vitamin D (specifically D3, the form of Vit D you get from the sun) is essential to for properly absorbing the calcium we all know is so important as we age. Without D3, you may be missing out on benefits from the calcium in your diet. Most people start taking Vitamin D3 after they experience signs of deficiency. You may have heard that D3 shouldn\u2019t be taken alone- and it\u2019s true! Let us explain. While Vitamin D ensures that calcium is absorbed, Vitamin K2 (specifically as MK-7, the most bioavailable form) directs it to areas of your body such as your bones, so it can be put to good use. Without K2, the calcium absorbed may be deposited in the arteries, where it can lead to calcification or other issues. Bottom line, Vitamins K2 & D3 are truly the perfect pair. If you\u2019re serious about supporting healthy bones,experience the benefits of Bronson's K2 + D3!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this combo a couple of times now and love the convenience. For years I\u2019ve taken D3and K2 separately because in early combo offerings the D was way too low for my needs (5000IU). Finally supplement manufacturers have realized the need for higher amounts of D in their combo formulas and I\u2019m happy about that; it\u2019s more convenient and (in most cases) cost effective.I know from personal experience that taking the D supplement works. I have very fair skin and don\u2019t get much direct sun so wasn\u2019t surprised years ago after a blood test that my D level was only 20. I started the D3 at a low recommended dosage, but after much research upped it to 5000 IU per day and took it faithfully thereafter. Subsequent blood tests over the years showed my D up to 60, and then 80 so I know I absorb it well.",

                "reviewText": "As I have gotten older, I seem to have developed a Vitamin D deficiency and because of that my doctor insists that I take Vitamin D to help compensate for that. So, I have taken D3 for the last few years to supplement my nutrient deficiency. During that time, I have tried different brands of Vitamin D in an effort to determine what works best for me.A couple things that I have learned in that journey is that you want to find a vitamin that is easily absorbed into the body, which K2 is supposed to help with that. Also, it is important to pay attention to the level of that particular vitamin in each capsule as it is not always necessary to go for a very high level if your body does not need that amount. It can be as bad to have too much of a vitamin as it is too little as you could be hurting your health as well as wasting your money on high levels you don\u2019t need and the body won\u2019t utilize the excess.I got this particular brand because it contains the combination of K2 and D3, which helps in absorption into the body. The capsules contain 5000 UI of D and these pills are comparable with the same level of D (5000 UI) to the various name brands I have used.The pills are a good size that makes them easy to swallow. According to the bottle these are made in a US facility, which is good and the gel capsule is vegetarian based. I like the fact that this brand has been around a long time as well.The quality of the pills appears to be as good as any brand I have taken but I do think these are priced a bit high (currently 24 dollars) for a 240-count bottle.Since I have started taking these, my vitamin D levels have normalized. Coincidently, I have noticed that these in combination with Magnesium supplement, my blood pressure levels have gotten better and I have had less inflammation in my sinuses. I cannot say that these directly have had an effect as I can only say that is what has occurred since taking these regularly. I will update over time as I see long term effects or results.4 stars",

                "reviewText": "I decided to buy these because I am someone who sits in their room all day and gets minimal sunlight exposure. They are easy to swallow and tasteless. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin so take it with foods that contain a decent amount of fat.My experience after taking this supplement? So far it's been great. After the second day of taking this Vitamin D supplement, I was full of energy and had a very happy feeling. Since then, I find myself taking fewer naps throughout the day and feeling way more productive. I always suspected I was low in Vitamin D, but I did not expect how nice I would feel once my body started to get and use what it lacked.Your mileage may vary. You really should consult with a doctor before taking supplements.",

I was taking 10,000 IU per day of another brand made from Lanolin (many are) over a long period of time and I still had low vitamin D. Within 2 weeks of taking these 5,000 IU daily my vitamin D went up to a normal level! I love that Vitamin K is combined as it is essential to supplement with Vit K when taking Vit D. Warning, this dose is too high for most people to take daily (I have a leaky gut), so only take as often as your Dr recommends or take a lower dose.",
