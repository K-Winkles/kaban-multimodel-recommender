                "reviewText": "These had a slight vitamin odor upon opening them and tasted just okay. I decided to check the exp date and they were September, 5 weeks shelf life left. I will use them up before that, but they certainly would have smelled and tasted better if they were fresher. I'm not familiar with this supplement company. I know many distribute under different \"brands\". I would prolly order a different \"brand\" next time and hope for longer shelf life.",
