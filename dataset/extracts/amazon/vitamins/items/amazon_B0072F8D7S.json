                "reviewText": "I read a review that said these don\u2019t digest because they took a long time to dissolve in water \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, which scarily has 700-some odd \u201chelpful\u201d votes. This is not even close to what happens in the digestive tract, and is a misleading statement. The pH of water is neutral (7). The pH of the stomach is 1 (HIGHLY acidic due to the hydrochloric acid our bodies make to digest foods and break down complex nutrients so our bodies can absorb & use them). Sinking a vitamin in water and saying they won\u2019t digest is completely misleading and inaccurate. These capsules are designed to dissolve at a specific rate IN THE DIGESTIVE TRACT, not a glass of water. These vitamins DO work to improve hair, skin, and nail health. I\u2019ve been taking these for several years and they have improved the condition of my hair, skin, and nails. I have thyroid disease and an autoimmune condition that has caused my hair to thin out badly and become brittle, and made my nail and skin condition poor as well. I\u2019m 38 and I\u2019m a skincare & hair care formulator with a small business, and I hold myself to the highest standards regarding transparency and educating my clients about false beauty claims and ingredients, and ethically sourcing my raw materials. I also have a background in medicine, I am educated extensively in these fields. You can fact check me, in fact, I encourage you to do so. Don\u2019t let a completely irrelevant glass of water \u201ctest\u201d deter you. This supplement has everything the body needs to improve the health of hair, skin, and nails from within, which is where it all starts. This product doesn\u2019t regrow hair, but it does improve the texture and health, in my experience. My nails look much better as well. This is a safe vitamin (per my doctor, ALWAYS consult your doctor before starting a supplement, and read the ingredients list for potential allergens) containing vitamins/nutrients the body needs anyway, and is \u201cnatural\u201d (I use this term loosely because \u201cnatural\u201d has no meaning in the skincare and haircare world; just like \u201cgreen\u201d has no meaning, it\u2019s a gimmick, if you want proof of this, check with the FDA; no laws or regulations exist that define \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d in beauty/cosmetics and it is just another gimmicky, misleading way for beauty companies to take your $$, no regulations or laws exist to prevent any company from making these claims and no definitions or parameters currently exist that even define what they mean in beauty), for those who want a product with no \u201cchemicals\u201d (meaning chemical actives, I.e. minoxidil, as every single thing on earth is a chemical & has a chemical formula; water is a chemical, H2O is it\u2019s chemical formula). Please take the time time to check the facts on products because the cosmetic/beauty industry is almost entirely unregulated as far as claims companies can make, save for any kind of claim to treat or prevent conditions, I.e. sunscreens, as these types of products are considered drugs by the FDA. These do digest, but can be a bit irritating on an empty stomach if you happen to have a sensitive tummy. I do have a long history of GI problems as part of my health conditions, so I take these with food to prevent a bellyache. For the price, you can\u2019t really beat these as a simple and effective way to help improve the condition of hair, skin, & nails, as long as your doc gives you the green light. I hope this helps for anyone who isn\u2019t aware of the plethora of misinformation in beauty, it\u2019s literally my job to know the science and the laws/regs about products and ingredients, and to be 100% FDA compliant. Do your homework folks, because there is a TON of bad, misleading \u201cinfo\u201d out there about all things beauty. All in all, I give this product 5 stars. This is a great way to improve your beauty regimen from the inside out, and good health will always be the number one way to keep your hair, skin, and nails looking and feeling good.",

Then I got old and hit menopause and my fingernails got weak and started curving under. So I had to keep them cut short and quit polishing them. My DR said it just happens. Plus my hair is now thinning ,too. So I decided to try these supplements and within 6 weeks my nails got strong again and they now grow out straight and pretty. And I also started growing back hair where my hair was falling out.I'm so thankful for this because it has given me back my confidence.I wish I had tried it sooner. You should try it too \ud83d\udc85",

FYI, it makes me ravenous, so I'm not able to take the full dosage daily. Currently considering taking it after dinner or at bedtime on a full stomach to avoid the hunger this supplement stimulates.
