                "reviewText": "The megadoses of this vitamin helps me in controlling my gastric reflux when used in combination with Apple cider vinegar and slippery elm. I feel better when I take these vitamins and they don\u2019t seem to give me an upset stomach from unknown substances that may be present in other brands. Not sure how much of the vitamin C is bioavailable after ingesting but seems to be a quality product. Easy to swallow and OK for vegans.",
