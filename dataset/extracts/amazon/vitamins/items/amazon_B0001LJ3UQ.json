                "reviewText": "Awesome, great tasting vitamin C chewables! The berry tastes awesome & these are easy on the stomach.Vitamin C is essential to wound-hearing & prevention of long-term, chronic pain problems down the road. It can also help if you already have pain issues.IMHO, everyone who has had surgery or an injury to a limb, I'd take 3,000-5,000mg/day for roughly 6 weeks, then taper down to a regular every day dose. My chiropractor gave me an article from a chiropractic journal on the prevention of CRPS/RSD after surgery & injury to limbs, and a good vitamin C supplement reduces the chance by roughly 6-fold of developing RSD or CRPS.In addition, we all know that vitamin C has other antioxidant properties & thus health benefits.These taste like a tart candy (very much like sour sweet tarts!)For those who can't take citrus, yet need a vitamin C supplement, these are a great solution!For those of us who don't, they really taste great!",

I was surprised to read another review saying they were \"bitter\" because that's definitely not the word. \"Tart\" is the correct one, just like when you run across a tart fruit or berry. Since I don't use artificial sweeteners, or even like the taste of things too sweet, this is the perfect chewable C for me (as a matter of fact, I ended up returning the Kirkland brand for the very reason that the sweetness almost made me gag (and if you check those ingredients you'll see the load of mixed artificial sweeteners). Since absorption begins in the mouth, it's always best to take chewable supplements whenever you can, so I strongly recommend this one.",

The bottle lists strawberry. So if you have allergies, check the label on the bottle you receive. This must be a new formulation, because the Blueberry, Rapsberry, Boysenberry flavor I bought previously didn't list strawberries. Otherwise great vitamins.",

                "reviewText": "You can fool some of the people some of the time, but not ALL of the people ALL of the time. Why? Because approx. 75% of the populace are not supertasters.Thus, even if this product became off-flavor since the past (due to changing the order of ingredients) medium-tasters or non-tasters may not detect it.Below is the proof of change:I have a bottle with a 2012 exp.date which i'd kept in my fridge & one chewable-tablet is left of that one.I have the 2012 bottle next to the 2017 bottle which I just purchased via Amazon.You better believe, the quality is warped compared to the past. It has a weird off-taste.The 2012(exp.) Berry-C tastes yummy by comparison to my newly purchased 2017-version.Of note is that its yummy even though its way older! (albeit fridge of course)So I checked the ingredients of the 2012(exp.) bottle compared to the 2017(exp.)Sure enough, see the change below, however miniscule it may seem.(i.e. in the 2012 version:...there were more of the berry flavors than of the mag.sterate.Whereas in the 2017 version:...there's more of the mag.stearate than the berry flavors.And indeed, the coloring of the 2012(exp.) tablet was deeper-rosier-looking, whereas the 2017(exp.) version has more of a paler-bluish tint.\"OTHER\" INGREDIENTS OF THE 2012-EXPIRATION BOTTLE:Dextrose, fructose, color (red cabbage), flavors (blueberry, raspberry & boysenberry), magnesium stearate (vegetable grade), citric acid, citrus bioflavonoids, hesperidin bioflavonoids, rosehips, rutin, silica.\"OTHER\" INGREDIENTS OF THE 2017-EXPIRATION BOTTLE:Dextrose, fructose, natural color (red cabbage), magnesium stearate (vegetable grade), natural flavor (blueberry, raspberry & boysenberry), citric acid, citrus bioflavonoids, hesperidin bioflavonoids, rosehips, rutin, silica.",
