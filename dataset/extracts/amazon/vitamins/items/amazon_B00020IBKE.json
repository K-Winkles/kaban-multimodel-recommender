                "reviewText": "I've switched to Solgar supplements (including this product, the vitamin C with RoseHips) within the last year and am VERY pleased. I have to avoid gluten and soy and didn't even realize that most of my supplements had soy in them...and I wasn't buying bargain basement supplements or anything, they were high end...they were also full of garbage that's problematic for a lot of people. There are a lot of other things that *aren't* in these supplements (sugar, artificial colors, yeast, etc.) but no gluten or soy was most important for me. If you're going to take the time to take supplements and spend money on them, get supplements that have only the best ingredients and DON'T have ingredients and fillers that could be harmful to your health. Sometimes (although not always) I have to pay a little more than I was before I switched to Solgar, but I think it is well worth it. Also, when I order the Solgar supplements on Amazon, as opposed to when I have purchased other brands in the past, they're always fresh with an expiration date WELL in the future. I feel like I'm getting a great value for the money. BOTTOM LINE: A top notch product at a good value!",
