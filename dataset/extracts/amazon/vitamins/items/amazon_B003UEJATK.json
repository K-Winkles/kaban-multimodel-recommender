Now Foods Vitamin D-3 5000 Iu Chewable, Mint, 120-Count I take these myself, and I am 45 years old. Having to take so many prescriptions and supplements on a daily basis has led me to replace any of them I can with chewable versions, for the sole purpose of reducing the number of pills I have to swallow on a daily basis.My Iron levels were dangerously low, so my Dr. suggested I increase mine by using an additional iron supplement, along with the multi-blend vitamin I was already taking. This was in January, and I have just had my levels re-tested for the first time since then, and am very happy with the results. My iron levels have returned to normal while taking just the once-daily dose.\u2747\ufe0f NOW FOODS also makes a BERRY FLAVORED 1000 lu CHEWABLE D3 AS WELL - I give this to my children, but they can also be taken by an adult who is not in need of the full 5000 lu D3 dose, but rather just needs to boost their iron a bit, .. I love the flavor of them, but taking 5 a day to get my 5000 lu isn't exactly cost-effective, so I take the mint. Here's the link to those: Now Foods Vitamin D-3 1000 IU Chewables, Fruit Flavor, 180-Count \u27a1\ufe0f TIP: PURCHASE ONLY LISTINGS THAT SAY: \"SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon.com\" \u2b05\ufe0fI am weary of so many of the supplements in today's market, there are so many that are purely garbage, especially ones sold online. One thing that I do to ensure quality, is to purchase all my vitamins and supplements from Amazon listings which say \"SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon.com. This insures that your item is being sold directly by Amazon, and that it ships from their warehouse. Vitamins and supplements are not something I trust from a third-party seller. Additionally, any issues you might have can then be directly addressed with Amazon.com Customer Service, and dealt with quickly. Whereas, you never know what you're going to get when purchased and shipped by a third-party seller, or if you will ever be able to get in contact with them the future, should you need to\u2705 GREAT TASTING -These taste great! I would liken the taste to that of the wintergreen-flavored little blue circle in the center of a \"Breath-Saver\" brand breath mint, and the texture is quite similar as well.\u2705 TEXTURE IS GOOD - Easy to chew, Falls apart in your mouth. It is a tad gritty, but compared to other vitamins I have tried, this is very minimal.\u2705 EGG FREE, SOY FREE, DAIRY FREE, AND GLUTEN FREE.\u2705 PLANT-BASED, WHOLE-FOOD PRODUCT - LANOLIN IS THE SOURCE of the D3 in this chewable.\u2705 EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY - This is not the only Now Foods Vitamin that I take. I take quite a few others, and have had good results with them.\ud83c\udf10 OVERALL - This is a brand I trust and I am very pleased with the results.I am grateful that, for the moment at least, they are available as a \"Shipped From and Sold By Amazon.com\" item. I would recommend doing this with any vitamin and supplement purchases, when available. If you have any questions leave them in the comments and I will be happy to answer.",

This particular brand is a little chalky and very minty, but not bad. I alternate between these and another chewable that is cherry flavored. My wife dislikes the minty flavor but it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m 10 times more likely to take a chewable everyday over a normal pill.
