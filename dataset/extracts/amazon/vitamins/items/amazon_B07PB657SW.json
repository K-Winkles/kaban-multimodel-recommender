I ran it past my doctor first and she approved right away of the ingredients. I was not too hopeful of course as we have tried many alternatives but the first day we gave these to her she was begging us for more!!!! I had to taste them myself and understood what she was saying. They have a delicious flavor and I feel better knowing that shes getting real nutrients from real food.If you\u2019re thinking of giving these a try, it\u2019s worth every penny.",
