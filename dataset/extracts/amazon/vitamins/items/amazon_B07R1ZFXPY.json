                "reviewText": "UPDATE: after taking these for a month I got another bottle and got this weird rash on my back. I am not sure if it's quality control or what but it was strange. I stopped taking the vitamins and it went away. Wanted to make sure it was the vitamins so I started taking them again and sure enough the rash came back. I threw the bottle out. I will not be re-ordering this product. I was so hopeful but you get what you pay for in this instance. Not worth the health risk.These vitamins are great. Like that they are in capsule for easier digestion. Was using other brand and started causing headaches. This eliminated the headaches and is giving me the minerals and nutrients I need. I'm post gastric bypass so I must take these multiple times a day and it doesn't cause any adverse effects while being WAY more economical than the branded bariatric vitamins.",
