                "reviewText": "8Apr2021: I dont know why the seller is increasing the price of this product like it is petrol/desiel???!!!!! Is it because Ia m purchasing it?? Or is it because I wrote review that states it regulates the periods and hormones???!!! Either ways no one I am NOT going to leave any review if a product works for me... because the price of the product went from 800rs in Nov 2020 to 2000rs in Apr 2021 ..... 4 times??!!! INSANE !!!Yes the product works .... but really you the seller wants to play the bad guy making it out of reach from lakh of women???????????????????????????????????????===========Well I bought this for my mother as she is going through menopause after googling I found that b6 helps maintain progrestrone and estrogen balance and I thought this might help my mother. After researching further on ttc forum and reading reviews on amazon usa i found that many women are taking this for nausea after getting pregnant and it is helping them..... Then i thought my periods are 40+days and inspite of eating healthy excersing it isint coming in 30+day range which was my normal in my teens. So i thought i should also take b6.... So i started taking it after 3rd day of my period cycle until 20thday of my period where I stopped suddenly because i felt it might not have any effect on my periods..... Welllllll my period arrived on 32nd day and I AM SHOCKED .... IT IS MORE THAN YEAR WHEN my period fall on 30+day range soooo this is awesome yayyyyyyyyy!!!I am going to continue taking b6 and lets see when my next period arrives.... Super excited dhinchak dhing dhing yayyyyyyyNote: 34 yr no kids pilates dialy 30minute and i eat fairly healthy except needing rice every single day in afternoon and also I do take the following tea to regulate my hormones naturally: tea made from--Red raspbbery leaf, Stinging Nettle leaf, Dandelion leaf and moringa powder -- 3 cups a dayMultivitamin by naturemade",
