                "reviewText": "My kiddo has tried several different brands of gummies and the ONLY one we found that she REALLY loves and looks forward to taking every morning are these ones! I also love how it's made specifically with ingredients and essential vitamins that our growing teens need! They even have the same kind and brand but made specifically for the teenage boys! I highly recommend these and buy them every month!",
