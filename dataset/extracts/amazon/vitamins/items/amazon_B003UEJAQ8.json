                "reviewText": "I subscribed and then cancelled preferring to wait and see. I can't be sure it isn't just natural evolution that happens when I am clear headed and surrendered to God but.... there is a kind of certitude and strength that is consistent. I feel more confident. I checked the ingredients with more care even though I had looked at them closely before buying. I can't be sure what is happening but.... I am unwilling to do a test and discontinue. It may be a placebo effect but I have been willing to discontinue and do tests with other products. I notice only one ingredient I'm sure isn't useful = the magnesium oxide isn't well absorbed.But I get magnesium from Wholesome's Organic Blackstrap Molasses and it certainly helps get things started in the early morning vis a vis the bathroom. And also from salt sole (do the research on that - no more need to buy magnesium and you get all the calmness you could want plus a ton of other benefits from all the minerals.The vitamin is even good just to taste: I like the shape, and taste of it just in the short space before swallowing. It is natural and leaves that impression. A surprise was the inclusion of digestive enzymes. I hadn't noticed that earlier but now, I can save on digestive enzymes... not 'needing' to take one anymore with the am smoothie.Will be a subscriber; the search is over. It wasn't a very long search. But... I'd assumed I could manage without a multivitamin and now see I am happier just broad-spectrum happier now than before I began taking the Alive 50+ for women. Very glad to be more composed, stronger, as challenges of relocating to the mainland are coming up close to election time or early next year - more than usually challenging because of all the activity going on. Hawai'i is very very quiet. We don't have violence here. But around election time on the mainland.... hmmm. Conservatives may need to take cover! :) But I am not afraid.",
