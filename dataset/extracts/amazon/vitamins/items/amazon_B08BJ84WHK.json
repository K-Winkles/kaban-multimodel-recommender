You know how everything on Amazon looks the same size in the picture? I was SHOCKED how big the box this came in was. Then I opened it.It is a HUGE bottle (300ct)!! It looks exactly the same as the smaller size just much bigger. It is a value and I love it. The trade off is the tablet is not coated so it is harder to swallow than other supplements I take even though it is not the largest. I still give a perfect score because value was my choice.",

I use the higher dose of the same brand bc I was pretty low. It brought mine from low safely into the normal range at my next labs (3 mo apart). He hadn't really thought about it until I asked for this review and we both noticed he has been feeling better overall. He says he doesn't notice any weird smell or taste and every once in a while he shakes the bottle bc they kind of clump together but then they're fine. They are smooth and easy to swallow. For the price and convenience I think the quality is good and I will buy again for both dosages. I hope this helps.",
