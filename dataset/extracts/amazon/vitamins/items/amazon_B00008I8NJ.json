USP sets official standards for dietary supplements. Visit the USP verified website for more information. *Based on a survey of pharmacists who recommend branded vitamins and supplements. Brand Story By Nature Made From the Manufacturer This Nature Made product provides vitamin C, a versatile and essential vitamin critical for the proper functioning of our immune system. In addition, vitamin C helps manufacture certain nerve-transmitting substances and hormones while helping absorb and utilize other nutrients, such as vitamin E and iron. Vitamin C also makes collagen, which holds connective tissues together in skin, bone, teeth, and other parts of the body. Vitamin C is an important and powerful antioxidant that works in the aqueous (water) environments of the body, such as the lungs and lens of the eye. Its primary antioxidant partners are vitamin E and the carotenes (such as beta-carotene), but it also works with the antioxidant enzymes. Vitamin C regenerates oxidized vitamin E and restores the antioxidant potential of vitamin E in the body. Vitamin C is recommended as part of a daily regimen for women's and men's health, longevity, heart strength, and immunity. No artificial colors No artificial flavors No preservatives No chemical solvents, yeast or gluten. Recommended By Pharmacists. USP Standards plus Nature Made's Pure Ingredients guarantee optimum quality. Guaranteed purity, potency and dissolution. See more",

Almost 50% of U.S. adults are not getting enough Vitamin C through their daily food intake (1). If you just want to make sure you\u2019re getting what your body needs, Vitamin C supplements may help.
