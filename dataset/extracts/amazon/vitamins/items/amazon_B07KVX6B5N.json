                "reviewText": "Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that strengthens the body defense system and critical for the growth and repair of ALL body tissues. It actually boosts your blood antioxidant levels. Needless to say it is a major player to help support our immune system, absorbs iron and iron helps wounds to heal, and helps preserves our bones, teeth and cartilage. When Vitamin C is combined with the antioxidant flavonoid Quercetin it makes a powerful combination. Quercetin is what gives the natural coloring in some fruits and vegetables, and grains. Why is Antioxidants important? They help protect the cells from all those nasty free radicals floating around your body causes a host of problems like chronic disease, allergy issues, inflammation, etc. When you take a supplement, you want it to absorb. Phytosome is a natural active type fatty acid. When the Phytosome (fatty acid) wraps around quercetin it protects it and helps increase absorption because the majority gets delivered in the body instead of a good portion lost from breaking down from our digestive enzymes. I have been taking some of Life Extensions supplements for years.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a vitamin taker. I take more medication for health issues than I'd like so I don't want to take more pills. COVID changed that. Last winter I was sick for 2 1/2 months straight. I live in Ohio and the cold mixed with runny-nosed grandbabies took a toll on my health last winter. I got pneumonia and it got a little scary before I finally pulled out of it. My mom has been on me for years to take vitamins but I thought I ate pretty healthy and didn't need them. I just had autoimmune issues that contributed to making me vulnerable to sickness. When the virus hit I was concerned but not overly worried. I isolated but still watched my grandbabies a few days a week. A doctor on social media began recommending people take a combo of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc so I researched it. Everything I read supported that this combination helps boosts one's immune system which I needed with or without the virus. Winter was coming and I knew not only I'd probably be sick again all winter but that I also had to avoid COVID. But vitamins are unregulated and I had no idea which brand was reputable and would give me the dose promised without fillers that could be harmful. So I researched reputable brands and Life Extension made almost every list of reputable brands. I've been taking this cocktail of vitamins for the past 8 months and I've had one 3 days long cold the entire winter. My husband is taking them too. He has COPD and gets sick a lot too and he also has had one brief cold all winter. I'm still doing what I was doing last winter watching my grandkiddles and they still have runny noses and colds a lot but I'm not getting them and I'm very much in the high-risk category for this current virus with all my health concerns. This is amazing to us. I'll never stop taking these vitamins and I feel good that I know I can just reorder and know that this product will be consistent and do the job. It's a big relief when you're a person whose health is compromised and you need to do all you can to stay on top of it.",
