                "reviewText": "Ok, I went into this totally skeptical that a \"piece of candy\" was going to effect my mood but I was desparate to try something. I was tired of being mad all the time, constantly, for no reason what-so-ever. About to explode over every little thing, all the time practically lol. Hated feeling like that.I was with my mom picking up a prescription at the pharmacy. While waiting for her I saw these in the pharmacy for the first time and was totally taken aback. The price wasn't bad, considering, so I figure sure.Fast forward to now. About a month later. Man how I wish I'd known these had been around. For me, it really didn't take but a day to start to realize that I hadn't gotten mad or even really irrated all day. That was a very odd feeling. Odd in a good way as it'd been so long since I knew what that felt like. So, I continued and have gotten through an entire week of work without feeling stressed, mad, angry or anxious. Really a first for me in a very, very long time.While I can't say this would work the same for everyone, as I don't know, but, for me, it's been amazing and I'm so glad I got it. My energy level has also been a bit off the charts as compared to how I was just a month ago. I was very lazy, moody, tired, bored, just uck feeling all the time. I'm noticiably not now and really can't sit still for too long. Like I was before. Not even close. For starters I'm writing a review. I don't generally take the time to write reviews.I now come here to buy as it's just easier than going to the store, but the price is basically the same.The taste is good. It's sour or tart but I like that. It's like eating a gummy worm. Easy to eat and a great taste.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been feeling amazing, motivated and energized since I started taking this. It\u2019s similar to Prozac but without the side effects. The flavor takes a little getting used to. It has a strong saffron taste.I\u2019m also taking Lavela (lavender pills) for anxiety, so I think it is having a synergistic effect with the happy worms. I\u2019m so glad to be feeling better without the side effects of medications.If you\u2019re depressed and have anxiety, I highly recommend Hello Happy and Lavela. Also try to incorporate a little exercise routine every week. I set small achievable goals for myself so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed. If you need additional emotional support get a pet. Ask your doctor to write you a note saying that you require an emotional support animal to help you and you won\u2019t get evicted\u2014in California.",

Went to try it and it smells like straight plastic in there but i didn\u2019t care, i ate 2 gummies and the taste is so yummy but the aftertaste is straight plastic, still trying to get the taste out of my mouth lol. Other than that I\u2019m sure these are great, just not gonna order from now on and I\u2019ll just go get them myself at a store near me!",

I loved the flavor when the first time I tried the gummies, but I didn't notice at first if they were working or not. Slowly over time, I can feel that it actually boosted my mood and made me more bright and bubbly. The product is awesome for clearing clouds on days clouds hang around you.",
