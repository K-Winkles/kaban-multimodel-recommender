These really kick out a cold or flu virus quickly and they are easy on my stomach. I have been taking these for many years and never had any issues or side effects. The larger 1000 mg tablets are a little hard to swallow, so its best to take one with a piece of bread instead of trying to drink it down with a chug of water. The outer coating comes off quickly when in water, so once that happens it becomes chalky and difficult to swallow so down it quickly and don't get it lodged in your throat! They also come in smaller 500 mg pills that are easier to swallow. Overall a great Vitamin C!",
