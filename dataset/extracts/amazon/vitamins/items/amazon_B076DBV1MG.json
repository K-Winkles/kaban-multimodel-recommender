            "Helps maintain strong bones\u2014Vitamin D is necessary for bone health because, along with vitamin K, it gets calcium into your bones. Not only that, but we include multiple types of vitamin K in this formula: vitamin K1 as well as two types of vitamin K2.",
            "Supports thyroid health\u2014There\u2019s one more nutrient some people may lack: iodine. Common in table salt (and missing from many healthy diets), iodine is used to make thyroid hormones. Your thyroid helps regulate your body\u2019s metabolism.",

        "description": "An avalanche of favorable studies has resulted in record numbers of Americans supplementing with vitamin D. Since it is virtually impossible to obtain adequate vitamin D from food sources, supplementation with 5,000-8,000 IU daily is required by many aging individuals. Overlooked by almost everyone (except Life Extension members) is the critical importance of vitamin K. If one is concerned enough about their health to take higher dose vitamin D, it seems absurd to miss out on the benefits of vitamin K. For instance, vitamin D facilitates calcium absorption into the bloodstream and thus plays an important role in maintaining bone density. Less recognized is the need for vitamin K to transport calcium from the bloodstream into the bone. Vitamin K is also required by calcium-regulating proteins in the arteries. Together these two vitamins help maintain youthful calcium skeletal distribution while promoting vascular health.",
