If that isn\u2019t enough, we also boost our supplements with proprietary blends of organic fruits, vegetables and botanicals for an extra source of real whole food nutrition.

She takes medication that can make her tired during the day and this vitamin has given her that extra boost of energy that she needs to help keep her awake and focused for school each day. It has also helped with her skin. He face is noticeably clearer and her skin is a bit brighter than before we started taking these vitamins. I am loving these vitamins for my daughter, I just wish they made the ingredients organic. This is now our second month and I have signed up for subscribe and save with these vitamins. I love that these are whole food based and no synthetic vitamins or ingredients are used. I will continue to purchase these vitamins as long as their product continues to keep a high level of quality ingredients in these vitamins.",

                "reviewText": "So far, so good!After months of weighing out the pros and cons of other teen vitamins, I finally settled on these with the hopes that my 5'5\" barely 12 year old daughter would be willing to finally be able to swallow a capsule. Thankfully, even though it takes a few times, she is able to swallow them with a gulp of water or two.I had issues with other teen vitamins - either they were low or lacking in basic minerals that I found important for a teen, had too many unwanted ingredients/minerals or the reviews showed negative feedback (such as too large a pill, awful smell, etc).These seem to be the perfect answer to our needs. She's been taking them for about a month now (one at breakfast, one at dinner, as suggested) and she's doing great. No upset stomach, etc., so they don't seem to be too strong. In an off chance that she takes 2 capsules at the same time at breakfast, her stomach doesn't hurt or anything, which seems to suggest they're pretty easy on the digestive system as well.Since all is going well, we're going to subcribe to have these shipped monthly now.Great product and we are happy so far.",

                "reviewText": "I have searched many years for what I would call the perfect vitamin and this one is \"almost\" it -- I love the forms they use as they use superior forms of Vit A, B12, Folate, K2, B6 etc..It is also very hard to find D in the lichen form. Any other D causes me problems and the lichen form does not. Also great plus they do not use fillers. I think the size of the vitamin is fine and not too large -- also better than having to take 4 smaller caps a day. My kids do not have a problem swallowing it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is I wish they would take out the iodine or make one free of iodine -- we are family with thyroid problems and iodine can be harmful for those who suffer thyroid disease and especially Hashimotos. We rotate this vitamin with another that is iodine free ( i don't like the vitamin as much, but as long as this one has iodine it is the best balance I can figure out) With iodine already in most diets, having it in the vitamin is too much. Please consider making one without it.",

                "reviewText": "NATURELO is a PREMIUM maker of viable Multivitamin Supplements. For instance they use natural Folate rather than Folic Acid which is a synthetic imitation of the real thing. NATURELO uses Natural Beta Carotene for Vitamin A. Instead of Ascorbic Acid they use Liposomal Vitamin C. For Vitamin D they use D3 the preferred version for Vitamin D. Vitamin E (d-Alpha Tocopheryl from Sunflower. Vitamin K2 instead of Vitamin K. K2 (MK7) is the more potent version of K. So good for my arteries that I quit taking my related Big Pharma meds over 2 years ago and my blood pressure has dropped considerably with no negative side-effects. Do a Search for yourself. You might be pleasantly surprised. Vitamin B12 is the Methylcobalamin version of B12 rather than the more common Cyanocobalamin. Cyano/Cyanide. Cyanocobalamin is banned in Europe.....NATURELO IS A PREMIUM BRAND OF SUPPLEMENTS. I switched over to the NATURELO Brand over 2 years ago and I am glad I did. I take the version for men over 50 and found it to be for me. Let me just say I feel better.Caveat: No supplements will help as much as they might unless a person starts living a more healthy lifestyle. I started by eating more vegetables and less meat. I started drinking water in the evening instead of eating. I started loosing weight I had lived with for decades. I would lose some weight then gain it back and round and round I would go again and again. As we get older we become more and more dehydrated. Sometimes we think we are hungry when really we are thirsty. Three years ago I weighed 245 lbs. For over two years now I have weighed about 180 lbs. I vary back and forth between about 178 and 183. When I get to 183 I start drinking more water and within a few days I am back under 180. This is a range I can live with. A range that until the last few years I hadn't been able to sustain since I was in my late teens and 20's. I feel better than I have in a long time. I want to see my grandchildren grow up and I figure what I am doing is my best shot to stick around for a while. Of course there are no guarantees where life expectancy is concerned, but it is also true that one can change their odds of living a relatively long and healthy life by taking responsibility for one's own life. Three years ago I had a WidowMaker Heart attack. I have 5 Stents. My Cardiologist said I was lucky to be alive and take these pills for the rest of your life because we don't have a cure. I decided to do what I should have done years earlier, I started to educate myself so I could make my own decisions about my situation.One of the first things I learned is that the American Medical System was not the same as it was when I was younger. That it had for the most part changed when it became an Industry. The most important thing to the majority of the Medical System leaders became how much money was being made rather than the health of their customers. I no longer consider myself a patient. I am a customer. And I am shopping around for the best deal I can get. To many (not all) of today's Doctors are more concerned with pleasing Big Pharma and the Administrators of Hospitals.Don't wait like I did until something drastic happens to you that probably could have been avoided or at least handled better than I did. I had been taking medicines for Diabetes 2 for 10 years when I had my heart attack. Metformin had never dropped my fasting blood sugar levels. It just kept getting worse. For the last 4 or 5 years before my attack I had fought my weight swings from 240+ to 210 until I had finally given up. My doctor would just say here, take this pill for the rest of your life I think it might help you more than what you are taking now. After a few weeks I would realize nothing had changed. But over time I was slowly but surely falling into a mental fog. I wasn't thinking as good as I had when I was younger. I was not getting enough oxygen to my brain. I was not feeding my brain brain food. I was not eating the right things. Most Fast Food is Fat Food. Too much simple carbohydrates. Too much meat. Not enough Vegies. To much MSG. Too much processed foods that were becoming more and more Fake Food. The only thing most of the CEOs and Shareholders of the Food Industry cared about was Corporate Profits. Doctors and Legislative politicians began selling their integrity to the highest bidders. Not all did this, but far too many did. If you have a good Doctor, someone that takes their Hippocratic Oath seriously, :Do No Harm: count yourself lucky. Far too many Doctors today have become hypocrites rather than the best Doctor they can be. If you find a good one latch on to him or her. How do you know good or bad, pay attention, become a good patient, study your situation with a few books that relate to you. Take charge of your life before it is too late. Eat healthier foods, drink more water, go for a walk. It really is that simple once your new lifestyle becomes habit. I haven't felt as good as I have the past 2 years since I was in my 20's. And yes, even if I fall over dead tomorrow I will at least know I finally grew up and started manning up and quit being just another victim of the World System. Yes, I believe there is a Satan. If we don't take better care of ourselves it is no one's fault but our own. I don't hate Doctors or CEOs, or Politicians, or even Yankees fans for that matter, but I do pray for them. Just kidding, sorta. Take care of yourself, not in a selfish way, but in a healthy way. Eat an 80% or more Plant-Based Diet. Walk away from stress as much as possible. In the long run everything will even out. Spirit is eternal, the body is not. The Show is just getting started.",
