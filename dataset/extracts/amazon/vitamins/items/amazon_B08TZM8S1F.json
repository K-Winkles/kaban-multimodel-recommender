                "reviewText": "I'm picky about my drinks when it comes to hydration. My biggest problem is that water is boring. Gatorade is fine but it gets boring after a while, and not all flavors are appealing. Not to mention, half of all hydration drinks out there use artificial sweeteners, which are distracting and annoying to people who don't like the artificial sweetener taste (like myself).I would suggest these little packets for 8oz water bottles. I use 2 for 16-20 oz at a time. It makes a strong drink, and although there is a little bit of aspartate in them, I don't get the artificial sweetener taste at all.They have massive flavor, sodium, and the other re-hydrating additives that you need when sweating. You may not feel good drinking these while watching TV because that's not what they're for. It's for ACTIVE re-hydration, so when you're sweating, this is the helper and my new go-to.",

                "reviewText": "I originally was going to purchase Liquid IV because summertime is finally rolling around and I wanted to be prepared for those days of being out in the sun and sweating. I really just wanted to stay hydrated and feel healthy without worrying about heat sickness or anything of that nature.When I saw the price of Liquid IVs, I said, \"nope.\" and continued looking for other comparable options that didn't cost more than a week's worth of groceries. So, I stumbled across DripDrop. Honestly, I don't think this product is that bad. I just don't know if I will purchase again right now. Here is why. The flavors are fine, but they are definitely basic and not anything extraordinarily delicious. You have your citrus flavors, your berry, and a watermelon. I liked them all equally. By all means, if those flavors sound good, definitely try this product. The reason why I'm not so sure I'll keep buying these powders is that I genuinely think you can hydrate pretty well just by making sure you consistently drink water and make sure you have some salt and sugar coming into your system here and there too. That is really what these packets seem to be, just salt and sugar with some flavor. Because I'm cheap, I think I might just stick with water with a pinch of salt and sugar thrown in. This is just my feelings on this. If you are going to get one of these powdered hydration products, DripDrop seems as good as any.",

                "reviewText": "These little hydration powders are a lifesaver. I try to drink a lot of water throughout the day but sometimes I feel like my body isn\u2019t absorbing it. As in drinking a lot of water will make me pee more but I may still suffer from lethargy, headaches or dry mouth. These packets are incredible at solving that issue. I was a fan of Liquid IV brand and love few of those flavors but they were larger servings and had a ton of sugar. These servings are smaller but still pack enough of a flavor punch where I don\u2019t even need to add a whole packet to a standard water bottle for it to taste great. Because the package has less in each than the Liquid IVs, there\u2019s half as much sugar and it still gets the job done. It gets rid of my dehydration headaches within about five minutes of consumption. The flavors are also all really good in these. I would mix the lemon or orange ones in with my preworkout on particularly hot days when I anticipated sweating a lot and it mixed well. The only flavor I didn\u2019t love was the watermelon, which was a few of my friends favorite flavor so that\u2019s probably just attributed to my personal taste. Highly recommend this product for lower sugar and more affordable hydration supplementation!",
