And no iron is a plus, means no headaches. Men and women can use it, unlike most other brands that now have a different formula for each, so you only have to buy one bottle for a couple. I have more energy, no more daily naps, and I sleep better. They taste sort of nasty but they\u2019re only in your mouth for a nanosecond and there is no aftertaste or nasty burps. They are on the expensive side but well worth it. Most diseases and issues with aging are caused by vitamin deficiencies, so it\u2019s worth paying more for good quality.",

                "reviewText": "These are pricey, but fantastic. I\u2019ve tried a ton of different multivitamins and nothing has made me feel as energetic or alert as these. No upset stomach, pills are easy to swallow. I like to work out in the evening after work, but after a long work day, I would skip sometimes due to fatigue. These have given me the energy to be more consistent with my routines. Highly recommend.",
