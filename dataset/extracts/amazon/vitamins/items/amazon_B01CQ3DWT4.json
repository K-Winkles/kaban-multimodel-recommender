                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Why This Multi? Please Read Below!",
                "reviewText": "So when it comes to multis, it's important to find a multivitamin that is based on whole foods since your body utilizes the nutrients better over isolated synthetics. When these vitamins come from actual food or are incorporated into the food, your body recognizes it as food in its natural state compared to nutrients that were made in a lab. What's special about MegaFood is that they source over 500,000 pounds of fresh produce each year from organic, family-owned farms for these multivitamins. The produce is cold-milled and topped off with USP vitamins to ensure potency (the majority of the nutrient content comes from the whole food itself). The produce is then put through a Slo-Food Process that preserves all of the nutrients, colors, and aromas of the fresh produce. (This protects all of the health-promoting compounds in the food, such as the bioflavonoids or quercetin in an orange.) It is then tumbled into a powder and pressed into a tablet.This particular multi line by MegaFood, formulated by the renowned Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, launched in 2016 and is tailored to support each stage of a man or woman's life. This item, Multi for Men, is formulated for teenagers and men in their 20s and 30s. It is a balanced formula with an increased amount of zinc for the healthy production of testosterone. Also included is choline -- a very important nutrient that many of us are deficient in with the modern diet. Choline, commonly found in liver and egg yolk, is a crucial nutrient for memory, cognition, muscle control, and fending off fatty liver disease. The majority of multis do not include choline in their products so this is a major feature to set MegaFood apart from the rest.This multi also includes the methylated forms of folate and B12. It is estimated that three out of every ten people are unable to convert the unmethylated forms of folate and B12 into the active forms. Therefore, it is best to just take the methylated versions regardless because your body will already know what to do with them. There is also Vitamin K2, an important nutrient for bone health, which is delivered with cabbage. Again, this is a balanced formula that works to keep your blood levels where they need to be without getting you in trouble. You won't get too much or too little of anything with this supplement.Taking a multivitamin is an effort to mind the gaps in our everyday diets. It is nearly impossible to get the exact amounts of nutrients that we need from eating a balanced and healthy diet alone, especially since our requirements vary depending on gender and age. Another important factor to consider is soil degradation. Studies have shown that the nutrient content inside many of our fruits and vegetables has declined over the past several decades due to chemical farming, deforestation, and climate change. Incorporating a daily multivitamin as your insurance policy is one of the best ways to keep yourself in good shape.",

It was of course shattered to bits by the shoddy packaging of Megafood's fulfillment service. I was surprised that I could not return or replace it. I reread the policy and learned it was eligible for replacement. After several attempts,I finally found a way to replace it by clicking through a link that took me to Megafood's website to replace it. I was contacted within 24 hours by Megafood. I learned that Amazon should have directed me to the fulfillment service instead of to Megafood but that they would resolve the matter on my behalf.Less than a week later I have received a replacement jar properly shipped in a box with more than adequate protection added in the box. Thank you Megafood for standing behind your products. What started as a negative experience was converted to an extremely positive experience. Well done Megafood.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I just hit the Five Star \"button\", above, but the truth is I have no clue as to the efficacy of the manufacturer's claims and, so early in the game, I have no way of knowing if I am going to feel better after taking these pills. I like the ingredients; they make sense to me, but it will be a while before I notice any effects-for-the better, if I do at all. So, right now, I'm just happy to have a what appears to be a good multi-vitamin at my disposal. If I feel noticeably better in a couple of weeks, great.I'm noticing that the next two questions, below, the next two things to rate are, first, \"Flavor\" and, second, \"Value for money\". Well, there is no flavor when you are taking a pill with water and I'm not sure about the \"Value for money\", not now, anyway.",
