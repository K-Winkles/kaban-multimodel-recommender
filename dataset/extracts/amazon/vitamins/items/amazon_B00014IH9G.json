This usually means that we have to take with a very large carb-heavy meal or we'll wind up paying the price with a nasty stomach ache for about four hours each. In other words, it sucks. I also take MegaFood Blood Builder for iron and since I had great results with that product, (zero constipation, no stomach upset, and no food required), I though I would try these. I love them because I can take them any time of day with no worries of pain afterwards. They are expensive, but our health is more important so we scrimp on other things to afford to pay for these. I also like that MegaFood is a company whose sole objective is creating superlative vitamin supplements - period. These will be my family's vitamin of choice from here on out.",

                "reviewText": "I switched over to these as I became more involved with a Keto-Adapted lifestyle which goes deep into supplementation and emphasizes 'natural sources'. I take SO many supplements at a particular dosage and wide range of 'type' custom to my body and 'healing process' away from grains/wheat/gluten/sugar and in my case, also dairy (though it is allowed on this lifestyle). That said, the drugstore One a Day for Women had been my 'go to' for an all around multi vitamin for months. Im a health food store looking at something else, I heard a man talk extensively about this Mega Food vitamin and he was there to get it for his wife. He was very specific about which one and I eaves dropped on the conversation. I learned alot and was sold essentially to try it. The sourcing and science is very interesting and the 'whole food' aspect was right up my alley. My only complaint is that at Whole Foods Markets the product was WAY more expensive. I bought a 60 cap for the price of the 90 cap here on Amazon. So I paid $50 for the 60 cap which is $32 on Amazon. I hate feeling ripped OFF! LOL! So I am stocking up on the 90 here. THAT said, I prefer to put this in my body over all the other options. Ive had no issues swallowing (though Im not a fan of pills much less BIG pills and I have a few). Because Im taking other very good supplements its hard to say which gets 'credit' or sole credit for the noticeable improvements in my health, hair and body. I do know my nails are insanely growing and thick and strong and no longer are thin, transparent and peeling. But that could be any number of things Im taking. I take Lugol's iodine as well as a Prescriptions Hair, Nails biotin supplement that is 10,000mcg a day. But in-spite of that, I love this product. Quality sometimes do cost so I find it worth the trouble. and $47 for 3 months is only roughly $15 bucks a month. One less star for the size of the pill (if I could take off half a star instead of one I would). It would be nice to have a further breakdown of 'type' of magnesium on this brand's magnesium version or zinc etc (is is glycinate, picolinate, citrate, etc). Perhaps those done exist in 'real food' sourcing only chemical?",

                "reviewText": "I had been taking New Chapter for a while and really did not feel much of a difference. New Chapter occasionally would upset my stomach if I did not take them with food. I can't remember how I found the MegaFood brand but I am immensely grateful for however I found them. I have been taking them for about a month now and I can honestly say I feel great. My levels of exhaustion are virtually gone. The immune system I thought was non-existent is in full force. I typically catch a cold about once a month or once every other month because I work with kids. I have gotten symptoms of a cold the last month or so but they rarely last more than a day. I really think these vitamins have helped my immune system get a jump start against colds and viruses. About a month into these vitamins, I have been waking up BEFORE MY ALARM!! I am actually awake and I feel refreshed. I have NOT changed my bedtime or anything with my sleeping patterns. I take these every morning with a glass of water and I have absolutely NO upset stomach. There are mornings were I'll take the vitamins and I'm not able to eat breakfast (or I forget to) and these have had no reaction. I have an extremely sensitive stomach with \"common\" vitamins found at drug stores. I cannot praise these vitamins enough and encourage everybody to give them a try. The true effects are really visible after a month of consistently taking them once a day. I will admit they have a somewhat garlic taste but it's MUCH better than the One A Day vitamins taste in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I have never had problems swallowing pills, and don't subscribe to all the marketing hype that these and other vitamin brands claim. HOWEVER, these vitamins are the only ones that don't give me a daily dose of heartburn. I have done other brands that are supposedly plant-based and gentle/natural, and they have helped take my daily heartburn down to 3-a-week heartburn days, but with these I have not yet had a case of heartburn at all, 2 weeks in. I also did the blood-builder type when I was anemic and having trouble with the regular irons, and that worked with no heartburn as well.Labeling says you can take with or without food- I usually try to do it with a meal or at least a large glass of water but have done on an empty stomach and even so, no heartburn!! I now have these on auto-ship and don't see myself changing brands any time soon.",

It\u2019s easy to swallow and a great insurance policy to my already healthy diet. The only \u201ccon\u201d is that in my opinion is that the pill sort of tastes like blood(?). I\u2019m sure i\u2019ll get used to the odd taste because it doesn\u2019t bother me enough to stop taking it. Will buy again.",
