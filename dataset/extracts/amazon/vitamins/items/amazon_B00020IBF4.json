With 100 vegetable capsules, this supplement is loaded with antioxidants and immune support. It's really helped her overall health, skin, and joints \u2013 and the addition of bioflavonoids is a great touch. Plus, with 100 servings in the bottle, it's been a convenient and effective addition to her daily routine.",

It seems everything is a sugary gummy, powder-coated pill that's huge and impossible to swallow or those gross chewables.These capsules are a decent size and easier to swallow, so for vitamins, they are good.

After a few days, I did experience a little tingling sensation in my cheeks and finger tips. I don't know what that was. One thing I really didn't like is the fact that one serving is three large pills a day. That was hard to swallow (no pun intended). Not bad though. Just not exceptional.",

Some reviews called it unusually large, but easy to swallow because of it being in capsule form, so I took a chance. I purchase Solgar supplements with the exception of one product, but I'm switching over to Solgar on that the next time I have to order it. Solgar is a superior product and you ALWAYS get what is promised. When I was in the hospital, I told them I had to have Solgar melatonin in order to sleep as well as other Solgar products. The pharmacists put my Solgar products through a qualitative analysis to be certain they were safe, and the amazing thing is that they called every Solgar product a \"designer supplement\" and okayed every one of them! That's how good Solgar is! I had what looked like a very severe vitamin C deficiency and had a few Solgar Vitamin C caps on hand, so I took 1,000 mgs and the next morning, like magic, the symptoms were almost completely G-O-N-E!!!! These came just in time as I ran out of my small stash of other Solgar Vitamin C in a different form. Bless this capsule, it's no bigger than any of my other Solgar supplements. I do have trouble swallowing pills, but these are easy to swallow, and are no bigger than the usual Solgar capsules. Another reason that I purchase Solgar is that I take kosher supplements only - I also eat only kosher foods - and just about all the Solgar products are kosher, as this one is. This is a great product, easy to swallow even for those like myself who have trouble swallowing, is high in quality, and because it's water soluble, is fast acting. You will not regret purchasing this product. It's truly superior to other Vitamin C supplements on the market.",
