                "reviewText": "I absolutely love nature's bounty vitamins and my vitamin B 12 is my favorite. It helps me stay energized and alert. Have been taking this for about 6 years now after feeling increasingly groggy and this plus my folic acid, D3, calcium, fish oil and fiber capsules do the trick! My suggestion is to always check your BMI and what levels you need at your age/weight before buying the proper vitamins for your health. It's worked amazingly for me. God speed!",
