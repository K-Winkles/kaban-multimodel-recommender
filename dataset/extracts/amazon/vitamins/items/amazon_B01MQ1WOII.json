Providing 100% of the NRV (nutrient reference value) for women, this formula is especially suitable for women of menstruating age to maintain iron levels. We use fully reacted and chelated zinc glycinate and the optimally absorbed copper glycinate chelate. As zinc and copper compete for absorption in the body, this formula contains an optimal ratio to keep the body in balance for long-term health maintenance. Bioavailable vitamin D3 & K2 While there are two forms of vitamin D, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is better absorbed and utilised and is significantly more biologically effective than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Vitamin K2 contributes to bone formation and redirects calcium from the arteries into bones; we use Menaquinone-MK-7 (all-trans not cis) which has better bioavailability and is retained in the body longer than any other form of vitamin K.",

                "reviewText": "I stopped taking multivitamins because I would always get nauseated and feel sick- sometimes even throw up after taking them, especially on an empty stomach. These multis are wonderful! I can take them on an empty stomach with no side effects whatsoever. They are easy to swallow. They do leave your mouth with a slightly icky vitamin taste but it goes away quickly. I don\u2019t think there are many vitamins out there that don\u2019t do that though. I do believe these have methylated B vitamins, which are the only kind I can absorb. I am vegan so I had been looking high and low for a vitamin with methylated B and Iron that was vegan friendly. These are great but I do wish they came in a bigger bottle. I run out fast.",

                "reviewText": "There are a lot of reviews speaking about the taste and smell of these vitamins. I don't know about you but I don't really choose my vitamins based on the way they taste or smell. I buy based on the ingredients and effectiveness of the product. I'm not going to lie, these smell and taste awful but, they are made that way because the company chose to jam pack the pills with actual vitamins and minerals as opposed to fillers and I'm okay with that. I can deal with a minute or two of unpleasant taste and smell to be healthier, in the long run.I recently started on Keto and decided I needed to supplement with a multivitamin. I tried another brand specifically for keto that majorly upset my stomach. I have a tendency to be sensitive to vitamins and some medications. I was worried that this might do the same but, I have been taking the full dose for three days now with no ill effects.Tonight I got an email from the company with a guide to taking this supplement and answers to some FAQs which I thought was pretty awesome.Overall, for the price and quality of the product, so far, I feel like it can't be beat. If you can get over the smell and taste, I definitely would recommend taking a shot on these!",

                "reviewText": "The size is perfect for easy swallowing besides being non-GMO VEGETARIAN. It is packed with the right combination of vitamins and minerals in the right proportion in the most desirable bio-absorbable form. This product distinguishes itself from others in this respect. They provide some of the b vitamins (pyridoxin and riboflavin) as phosphate derivatives instead of nitrate or other derivatives. B12 is provided in a methylated form which is most potent without side effects. Phosphates are more readily bio absorbed and thus very effective. Zinc is another ingredient which helps immunity against pathogens. The other minerals : molybdenum, chromium, copper, boron etc. are very beneficial as well. I have a suggestion for them: Please include manganese which is a trace mineral because recent studies have shown that manganese can reverse atherosclerosis. There are very few supplements to reverse atherosclerosis and manganese would be really a boon to anyone with arterial stenosis. And please come up a supplement for men without so much iron and added manganese",

HOWEVER... they smell SO terrible. They make me nauseous because of how badly they smell. So, while I DID take them and saw no positive nor adverse reactions to them, the stink (which permeates the bottle) means I won't be purchasing again.I'd like to note I do have sensory processing disorder so that may play a large role in it.

Altrimenti saprebbero che la forma di B12 meticolbalamina di questo integratore \u00e8 molto meglio della cianocobalamina, in genere tossica e presente negli integratori comuni, per giunta in quantit\u00e0 esagerata (che predispone al cancro al polmone). Per non parlare del metilfolato rispetto all'acido folico che, per essere utilizzato dal corpo in forma di folato, deve passare attraverso numerose reazioni, mentre i folati sono subito metabolizzati nel piccolo intestino. Oltre a non essere immediatamente disponibile per l\u2019utilizzo, l\u2019acido folico pu\u00f2 diventare pericoloso quando si accumula: diversi studi l\u2019hanno associato ad un aumentato rischio di cancro al colon.Quantit\u00e0 ottima pure di selenio rispetto ai soliti integratori.E poi il mio preferito: il glicinato di zinco invece dei soliti ossido, gluconato o citrato che sono meno biodisponibili e che danno enorme nausea.Se pensate che tutti i minerali e vitamine siano uguali, sappiate che non \u00e8 cos\u00ec e la qualit\u00e0 in base alla loro forma \u00e8 molto diversa.Inutile andare sul risparmio e acquistare prodotti inefficaci e dannosi, altrimenti si perde il senso stesso dell'integrazione. Allora a quel punto meglio non prender nulla!Io direi che questo prodotto vale il suo prezzo e anche di pi\u00f9, ricordiamo infatti che le compresse sono molte.
