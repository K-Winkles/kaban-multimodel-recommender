                "reviewText": "This multivitamin was a game changer for me. I have spent hundreds of dollars over the years on everything from the common brands to expensive specialty vitamins from natural food stores, and all of them left me tasting and \"feeling\" the vitamins in an unpleasant way. I've used this brand for other supplements and know they're a great company, but I was still skeptical that their multivitamin would work for me. I don't have any of the issues with the O.N.E. Multivitamin like I did with other brands, and I've been taking this for over a year now (I think their formulation is better and easier on the body). I feel SO much better taking it, too! I truly think it's the best multivitamin you can buy. It seems pricey at first glance, but you're getting two months worth which makes it comparable to many others on the market. Size of the pill is better than others, too.Regarding the smell: Other comments have noted that there's a stinky smell to the pills. I called the company, both to find out what it was and to make sure this wasn't a counterfeit product (I know Amazon tries to regulate, but it still happens sometimes). The company was very kind and helpful! The smell comes from a bit of sulfur in one of the ingredients-- it is a tiny amount, but sulfur can be super stinky even in small quantities-- and it's not at all harmful in that trace amount. I forgot which ingredient, it took me a while to post this, sorry! I found taking the pill with food and/or a little milk helped mask the smell and I rarely ever notice it anymore. Also, the smell decreases over time, so perhaps letting a new bottle sit open in a cool, dry place for a day or two might help, too. If you have more questions/concerns, don't hesitate to call the company-- like I said, they're super friendly and happy to answer questions.FYI: if you need magnesium for muscle or other issues, that is NOT included in this formula. Pure Encapsulations does sell two other varieties, though.",

Usually, I wake up with fatigue and that makes it difficult to get any work done. Since, taking these multivitamins (about 1mo) along with other supplements I have more energy than I've had in years. I don't wake up feeling fatigued as much and my energy levels have been increasing. I'm very thankful for Pure.",
