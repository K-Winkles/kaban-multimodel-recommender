                "reviewText": "After much research searching for a multi-vitamin for my college aged baby girl, we finally agreed to continue using this particular women\u2019s vitamin. Not only does this little bottle pack a powerful punch knocking out the competition as well as checking all the boxes with complete nutrition for each ingredient. The vitamins also help with her terrible mood swings. Ugh! Before vitamins she would to a full-blown grizzly each month, but using these vitamins things have seemed to mellow some. It could all be in our mind but it seems to be doing what it advertises and that is what we paid for and got a pretty good price. Hey Seller, thank you for your items. We really appreciate your assistance. I\u2019m gonna get with my son to see if he would do this for his employees and try the men\u2019s version as well. If you have any ANY at home worn for a military spouse, college degree, married 24+ years\u2026.please reach out. Thanks again.",
