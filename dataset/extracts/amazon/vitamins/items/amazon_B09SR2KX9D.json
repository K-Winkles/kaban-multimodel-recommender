With sun exposure, the body has the ability to produce Vitamin D from the skin. However, most people do not produce enough due to many factors.+ Vitamin K comes in two forms: Vitamin K1 (plant derived) and Vitamin K2 (animal derived). Vitamin K2 (MK-7) helps maintain a healthy circulatory system, and it works with the Calcium in your body to support bone health.+ These two nutrients make a great pair. K2 and D3 are important to activate proteins that support the elasticity of blood vessels, and adding K2 to Vitamin D3 also helps direct Calcium to bones. In fact, Vitamins K2 and D3 work better for bone health when taken together than D3 alone. Adults looking to support strong bones might consider a D3 + K2 supplement.+",
