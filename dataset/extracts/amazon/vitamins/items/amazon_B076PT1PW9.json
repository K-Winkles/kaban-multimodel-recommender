It has a \u201cnow & later\u201d candy texture- it\u2019s a bit hard at first but gets easier to chew. Does leave a very tiny gritty feel on your teeth after, but once you take a drink that does away. My kids are excited to take them in the morning because it\u2019s like \u201ceating candy for breakfast\u201d. Will definitely continue to keep buying as they need the extra minerals!",

I\u2019ve always heard that magnesium is good for kids with ADHD, and both of my kids are diagnosed, so I thought we would check these out. The thing is as a parent you can\u2019t really know if it\u2019s making that much of a difference because there are so many variables in their diet and changes in their hormones and sleep, etc. but I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt.

                "reviewText": "These are very sweet with a slight vitamin taste that is certainly tolerable but I can see why children may not like them. The taste doesn\u2019t linger and it disappears after a few sips of coffee. I can\u2019t swallow pills and I wanted a multivitamin that included minerals so it is what it is. This company is one of the only ones I found in a chewable that includes them. I tried liquid dropper type vitamins to avoid sugars and the one I tried made my mouth sour for a while and tainted the taste of anything I ate or drank after it. So these are my best option if I am going to be vigilant in taking a supplement.So beyond my personal opinion I am giving the company five stars because it\u2019s a nicely packaged product and good quality and arrived in perfect condition.",
