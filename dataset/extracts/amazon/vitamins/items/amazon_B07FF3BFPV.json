                "reviewText": "I decided to get my dad the MegaFood Men's 55+ One Daily Multivitamin a few months back, and so far, it's been a good choice. This multivitamin is perfect because it includes many crucial properties such as Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc.I like that this multivitamin is targeted to 55+ and older, and really helps that this supplement is made for people that are more older in age. The Vitamin B12 gives him more energy lately, while Vitamin C is there to boost his immune system. They've also added Vitamin D and Zinc to help his bones and overall health.He tells me that taking these pills is easy since they're not too big and go down smoothly. Even on busy days, he doesn't have trouble swallowing them.Since he started taking these vitamins, we've noticed that he's more energetic and in a better mood. It feels like his immune system is stronger too, which is a relief.The only downside is the price. These vitamins cost more than some others he's taken before. Even though they're good, the higher cost is a bit of a bummer since we like to stick to a budget.To wrap it up, the MegaFood Men's 55+ One Daily Multivitamin seems to be a good fit for my dad who is a senior and for others in his age range who need vitamins designed for them. They're easy to take and seem to really help with his energy and overall well-being. Just keep in mind that they're a bit pricier. If you're okay with spending more for good quality, these could be worth giving a shot.",
