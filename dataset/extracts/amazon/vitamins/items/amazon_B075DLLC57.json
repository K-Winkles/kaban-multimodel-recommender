I'm 21 years old and I know I don't get all the right nutrients in a day. These help out a lot. The pill is rather large and has a weird taste, but I take mine with a protein shake so it doesn't bother me at all. I definitely recommend these to any woman who needs a little help getting all their nutrients in.",

I did not notice any aftertaste like some vitamins can give you. Because of the results I am receiving from this multivitamin that I have never felt with any other vitamin and at age 65 trust me I\u2019ve taken a lot of vitamins. And this is 100% a great product that will give you what you need to get through your day and make you feel better. There\u2019s really not much I can say to convince anybody to really buy this product but please don\u2019t be discouraged by the other reviews about the pill being too large to swallow. When I open the bottle I was like wow this is a horse pill I don\u2019t know well here goes nothing it went right down and I\u2019ve not had a problem since. I am one that will read reviews and raise my reason to buy or not to buy from them but I\u2019m so glad I went for it because I was in need of a good vitamin that would actually work and in some of the comments I read they were definitely talking about how pleased they were with the results. And now I can honestly agree with them and share in this review telling anyone that takes these vitamins and can get them down without an issue will be very glad they purchased these.",
