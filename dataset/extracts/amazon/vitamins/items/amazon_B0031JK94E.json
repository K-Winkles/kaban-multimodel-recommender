                "reviewText": "I want to start by saying if you have a vitamin D deficiency, go see your doctor! However, I am genetically prone to getting vitamin D deficiency\u2019s, so after having two blood works come back within two years with extreme deficient vitamin D, and being treated for that with medical vitamin D, by my doctor, my doctor told me I needed to take a vitamin D supplement regularly from now on.He did tell me that they all pretty much work the same so I didn\u2019t have to use this brand in particular, but I love that the capsules are vegetarian, easy to swallow, small, and made by a brand that is trusted by many.Since I\u2019ve been taking these capsules, I haven\u2019t had a vitamin D deficiency since, and it\u2019s been a couple of years!",

                "reviewText": "This is a very high quality vitamin D supplement. I'm not going to go into all the science that backs up how this product differs from other D3 supplements because there seems to be other reviews that are doing a better job at that than I can.However, what I want to share is my actual experience with this product and explain why I have repetitively purchased it over and over again.It started when my son, who was about 5 at the time, started having boughts of behavior issues as well as some unusual joint pain. I had him tested for lymes disease which came out negative thankfully. The doctor did a run up on blood work to make sure there was nothing of comcern and results showed very low levels of both vitamin D and Zinc. The doctor said it was imperative to get those levels back in the normal range whether or not this was a reason for his medical issues or not because they were abnormally low.At first I began supplementing with a oil based liquid drop and really thought it was great: one quick drop and that's all it took but unfortunately it was not restoring his levels quick enough and his blood work was not showing an improvement even after months of supplementation.After almost an entire year of trying different products, I finally bought this one. He was too young to swallow the pill so I had to mix it in applesauce! He didn't like it but faithfully to it daily and his next lab results FINALLY showed improvement to the level that he no longer needed to take supplements for his vitamin D.Supplementing with this has GREATLY reduced his behavior issues since he no longer has drained D3 levels. He was almost diagnosed with O.C.D and no longer shows those tendancys. I'm not saying this is a treatment for those issues, but if your body is detrimentally low on any required nutrients, you will have issues and symptoms can only be resolved when you bring your levels back into the normal range.I still give it to him to keep his levels up but we are not rigid about it. I myself have also take it, as well as the Garden of Life Zinc that my son takes too. I can say from my own experience with it, I can tell a HUGE difference when I take it regularly versus forget about it for periods of time.I have PCOS and my D levels are typically low due to that. This helps greatly especially with energy and fighting off adrenal fatigue.We live in PA and getting good in vitamin D is very hard about half the year if not more due to weather. I am glad I found this supplement and will continue buying it. I know this one works and don't want to deviate from a trusted quality product that has so dramatically benefitted my son and myself.",
