Will I get fishy burps? Repeat burping or bad taste could mean your supplement may be oxidized. All Nordic Naturals fish oils are protected from exposure to oxygen at every step of production to help deliver an exceptionally fresh taste without fishy burps or aftertaste. Are there options for me if I have a hard time swallowing pills? Yes. We offer liquid options for many of our fish oil products, and our fish oil soft gels are chewable for those who have difficulty swallowing pills. Some products are also available in smaller, easier-to-swallow mini soft gels or chewable gummies. Are allergens present in Nordic Naturals products? We use FDA-compliant allergen labeling, and disclose any warnings relating to allergen exposure on our product labels. We recommend that consumers discuss product ingredients with a health care professional for any potential allergen concerns.",
