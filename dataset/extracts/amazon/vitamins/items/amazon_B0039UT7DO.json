They aren't lying about \"take with food\" though, I swallowed one then took my dog for a walk without downing a Clif bar first and I tell you I was extremely uncomfortable by the time we'd knocked out a few miles. Also the pill is on the large side & uncoated so it can be tricky to swallow if it goes sideways.",

                "reviewText": "I know vitamin supplement effectiveness is debatable, but the way I look at is, \"why not?\" Its like an insurance policy. I track my diet closely and noticed a trend of being short on several micronutrients all included in the 1 a Day multivitamins. If the body DOES absorb the nutrients, its a win. If not, the cost is worth it just in case it is an effective supplement. Saying that, I honestly do feel better when taking the Pro Edge multivitamin. I feel that I recover faster from workouts and have better energy throughout the day. For any active guys out there looking for a good multivitamin, give these a shot.",

                "reviewText": "Magnesium. I'm 40 years old and pretty active. My entire life I've been prone to calf strains (Charlie Horses). That's where you get that intense pain in the upper calf and your muscle balls up into this huge hard mass. I used to get them alot (about once a year) I haven't now in 5 years. It's probably because I'm very conscious of drinking alot of water both before and during activity, but I attribute some of the credit to these little pills. For those who don't know, water, magnesium, and potassium are the three ingredients muscles need to contract and relax efficiently. Potassium is hard to supplement because you can overdose on it and vitamin pills will never have more than a very small percentage of your RDA. Fortunately, it is easy to get a good supply from everyday foods without thinking much of it. I used to get magnesium pills but when I saw these, I figured why not? You get 50% of your magnesium RDA which is enough for me. Make sure it's the Pro Edge not the regular \"One a Day\". I have scanned all the other multivitamins at the drug store and none of them come close to 50% RDA for magnesium.",
