It's not to big and it not too hard to chew. The quantity is great for the price. The only complaint is that it gets soft and changes colour after a while. However, I noticed that the softness and colour change is caused by constantly opening the container. So I got a smaller dispenser and I place 100 tablets at a time in it while leaving the rest in the product container (airtight). That way, the Vitamin C remains the same way until its exhausted. For now, I will continue to buy.",

The taste is fine with a bit more emphasis on sweet than tart. I am very glad to have found these chewable vitamin C's!
