        "description": "Antioxidant ProtectionNon-GMOA Dietary SupplementVegetarian/VeganKosherGMP Quality AssuredVitamin C is a water soluble nutrient well known for its vital role in the immune system. Vitamin C is also necessary for the production of collagen (a structural protein in connective tissue) and is therefore important for skin, bone, and joint health. Vitamin C is needed for amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the utilization of many nutrients, such as folic acid and iron. It is also a highly effective antioxidant that can protect the body's cells and molecules from damage by free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules generated during normal metabolism and exposure to environmental stressors. This product was specially formulated to provide a sustained release of Vitamin C and includes Rose Hips as an added source of Vitamin C.This product is designed to release over an extended period of time.",
