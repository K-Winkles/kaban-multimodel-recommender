If you're the indoorsy type and get less than 15-30 minutes of direct sunlight per day, or if you've been diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency, then a dietary supplement is a great way to increase your vitamin D intake. Getting enough vitamin D is especially important as you age, so a vitamin D supplement is often recommended for people 65 years of age and over.

                "reviewText": "This one has a lot of vitamin D pills but it does have less potency. I started taking this after getting my vitamin d levels to better average. It is less potent so I am not over doing it on vitamin d. The first thing I will say is that these pills are relatively small and are bit powdery. If you open the bottle, you actually see the powder floating out of it which is a bit annoying. I keep the cotton ball on top to prevent that (it comes with the cotton ball). I just take one every day to maintain my vitamin D level up. It is suggested you take one a day if needed but this really meant to give you a little boost vitamin D but nothing out of the normal range. It is fairly easy to swallow and does not need much water but I still down a glass of water every time I take this. The pills do feel a powdery but at least they do not stick to each other. In term of effects, I got a blood test and my levels were maintained which is great (although I do walk outside as well). The pills do give me a good amount of energy and also improved my mood throughout the day. I did not feel as down and drained. I would definitely recommend this if you want a bit of a positive boost as vitamin D does effect your mood. It is just a pill a day. It is recommend you have a meal with it to make it easier to process but not required. It takes time for this to really effect you if want to just maintain your vitamin D level. It is inexpensive and provides you a good amount of vitamin d. The only thing I wish is that it did not look like its steaming when I open it.",

The effect is that many of the pills are smaller and when you get to the bottom of the bottle you will see enough powder to make several more pills out of it...such a waste. Other than that, the taste, and how they work is top notch but if they really want a review, they need to improve how the package arrives. (also, a bubble pad package looks pretty dinged up when you get it. Maybe a small box would be better).",
