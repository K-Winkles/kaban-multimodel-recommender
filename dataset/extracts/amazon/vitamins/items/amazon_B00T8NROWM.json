                "reviewText": "I've been taking a Vitamin K supplement for several years. Originally I had purchased Life Extension Super K , but when the time came to re-order I took another look at the choices available and the relative cost for each. More importantly, I also began to realize that there is an advantage to taking a K supplement that does NOT contain K-1 (see further below).I then decided to purchase this product for several reasons. First, as the product title indicates, it is a 'full spectrum' vitamin K, containing both MK-4 and MK-7. (See the bottom of this review for much more detail on MK-4 and MK-7, from the RWM review that is no longer present on Amazon). It also doesn't include soy, GMO's, or other ingredients that are undesirable. And finally, I felt that it was the most cost-effective (lowest cost per pill), for the dosage I want to take.These capsules also intentionally do not contain K-1, which is a strong positive for this particular K supplement. Here is the statement from the product label, not shown here on the Amazon product information: \"This product does not contain Vitamin K1 due to strong interference with blood thinning medications. K1 supplementation is not critical for adults, since your body can easily recycle it.\"I can't speak to any demonstrable benefit from taking these capsules. Vitamin's don't really work that way, most of the time the benefits are long-term and difficult to clearly identify. I take a combination of vitamins and supplements every day, based upon the research I've done and my own conclusions as to what is most likely to be helpful to me. It's not the kind of thing that's going to make an immediately noticeable difference. I consider it to be an investment in my health, and if the benefits are less than what I might hope for, then no harm done.I'll continue to use these capsules daily.Below, I've included the descriptive text from the previous RWM review that is no longer present here on Amazon. RWM's reviews were always thorough and well sourced, and it's a real shame that they are no longer posted here on this site:Vitamin K is one of the fat-soluble vitamins, along with A, D and E. There are two types of Vitamin K, namely K1 and K2. And within K2, there are several forms:* Vitamin K1 (Phyloquinones)* Vitamin K2 (Menaquinones)* MK-4* MK-7* MK-8 (not available in supplement form)* MK-9 (not available in supplement form)* MK-10 (not available in supplement form)Vitamin K1 is found in plants and is essential for blood clotting and coagulation. Supplementing is usually not necessary since the body recycles K1. It also blocks the effect of heart medications like Coumadin or Warfarin. Vitamin K2 can also have some effect on these drugs, so talk to your doctor about this.Food sources of K2Vitamin K2 is neither recycled nor stored by the body. Unless you eat Vitamin K2 rich foods regularly, you will become deficient in a matter of days. Making matters worse, it is almost impossible to get Vitamin K2-rich foods at the grocery store.The richest food sources are fatty goose liver, natto, and fermented cod liver oil. Much lower levels are found in sauerkraut, old world hard cheeses, caviar, organ meats, and grass-fed butter. Eggs from pastured chicken also have a little K2. Regular butter and cheese have very low levels of K2.Why is K2 important?It keeps calcium in your bones and teeth and out of your arteries. It also keeps calcium out of soft tissues like kidneys and cartilage, preventing kidney stones and heel spurs. Without enough K2, calcium may get deposited in your arteries, adding to arterial blockage. Calcium also attaches to plaque. This can cause hardening of the arteries, heart attacks and strokes.K1 provides little or no cardiovascular benefits. Studies have repeatedly found associations between K2 and heart health, but no such connection exists for K1.The different MK forms activate different proteins that affect different functions in the body. About 15 such proteins have been identified, most of them very recently.How much should I take?100 \u2013 200 mcg (micrograms) per day should meet your needs. There is very little risk of overdosing because the body does not store K2. See note above about K1 and blood coagulation.Different MK formsGenerally, animal foods contain MK-4 and fermented foods contain the longer ones MK-5 thru 14. We simply don\u2019t know much about the roles all of these K2 forms play.MK-4 is the most studied and consumed K2 in our diets. It is the main K2 form found in the brain. MK-4 is transported and stored in the body very differently than the other forms. It is the form of K2 found in breast milk. It is a fast-acting Vitamin K2. Babies need this form and are usually born deficient. In the US, newborns are given a shot of K1. In Japan, newborns get the more effective MK-4 instead. All healthy traditional cultures have consume mostly MK-4.MK-7 is often found in vegetables, especially fermented soybeans. The science on this longer-lasting K2 is still emerging but is extremely promising for heart health. MK-7 seems to be able to do some of the functions of MK-4 and it stays in the body for 2-3 days before being cleared. This higher half-life is desirable given its potent heart health benefits.MK-8 \u2013 14 are found in fermented products like cheese. These may have heart health benefits too but the science is in its infancy. MK-8 thru 14 are not available in supplement form.CIS or TRANS MK-7?Some manufacturers are starting to make absorption and bioavailability claims about these two forms. As of now, none of the products reviewed here discuss this subject on their labels. This topic is worth staying tuned to.MK-7 can be made from several sources, but the most popular source is soybeans. If you are soy-sensitive, you need to be aware of this. There are also MK-7 forms made from chickpeas and flower petals.Since there are only two K2 forms available, you\u2019d still benefit greatly from consuming K2 rich foods that contain other MK forms not available in supplement form.Finally, K2 works in conjunction with Vitamins A and D3. So make sure you are getting enough of those two vitamins as well.",
