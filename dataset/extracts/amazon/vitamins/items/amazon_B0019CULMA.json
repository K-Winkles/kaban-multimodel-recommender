                "reviewText": "I just couldn't make myself spend over $30 on exercise supplements that promise energy and weight loss. So I searched for a low cost alternative with a little caffeine in it. I even considered just caffeine, stay awake pills. But when I stumbled across these One A Day energy and saw it contained just a modest amount of caffeine AND Vitamins, especially B12, I was sold!! At the price it was worth the purchase and I am absolutely delighted that it worked way better at giving a good boost to my workout energy than those \"exercise supplements\" and all their marketing packaging with words like \"burn\", \"endurance\" and \"weight loss\"! I wish I'd not spent years and so much money on those and had learned about these One A Day Energy tablets! And I trust the brand name One A Day more that Zanadrine and Hypercut! (Not the real product names) Anyway, the only thing I was surprised about was how huge the One A Day Energy tablets are. But they are scored to be able to break them in half. I hope this product never gets pulled from the market. It's the perfect blend if you want to get your vitamins, minerals and a surge of energy! If you are super sensitive to caffeine, break these in half - that will still be effective!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this vitamin for at least 15 years. I used to work in a restaurant business and I survived all those long hours with this vitamin. Also this is my go to supplement whenever I travel, amazing support for het lag or long walks during my trips. Couple of things to be careful:NEVER take it to empty stomach and when you eat, eat well! Don\u2019t think it would be fine after a smoothie or an apple or couple of crackers will hold! NO!! Eat a sandwich, salad, full meal but EAT WELL! otherwise it makes a nasty nausea!Take it after breakfast for full day energy. If you forget take half at noon! If you take later forget about sleeping that night. If you need to stay up at night yeah then it\u2019s ok.For a busy say take full, for just a little pump take half, you watch your body and decide accordingly.I don\u2019t suggest taking more than one it just doesn\u2019t give you extra energy, it will bother your stomach, you will be alert but your body will scream to go to bad! This is not a miracle drug but it is a miracle supplement if you use it right.I buy this to everyone now and people tried generic ones or other brands thinking it would be the same, but no, everyone swears it\u2019s better than everything they tried.Recently I cannot find it in walmart or cvs or any other drug store so when you find it just stock it up, you won\u2019t regret.",

                "reviewText": "These One A Day vitamins work very well, especially when you\u2019re in need of energy. The vitamins also give you mental clarity when you\u2019re trying to complete complicated tasks. I used to buy them from Walmart but for some reason they quit selling them. I checked all the Walmarts in my area none could be found. I finally decided to try Amazon, BINGO the vitamins were available. The vitamins were $2 more than Walmart, I was just happy I could find them. They are so good, but always make sure you check with your health care provider before trying any new medications or vitamins.",
