I have been taking this D2 for several months now and I have noticed it working for me without that deadly side effects of the D3. When I was taking D3 before I knew I was allergic to it, I became increasingly sick with extreme nausea, severe abdominal pains and headaches to the point where I was literally crawling on the floor dying. What makes matters worse is where Vitamin D is fat soluble and takes a good 30 days to get it out of your system. Thankfully this Vitamin D2 is not harming me in any way and I can tell it is working as it should. I will recommend this D2 to anyone.",
