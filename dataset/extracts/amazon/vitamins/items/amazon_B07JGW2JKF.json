I use this product to keep up my overall health. I liked the price. I did a fair amount of comparison shopping and found that these were the cheapest at the time. They are all pretty much the same color, but come in different shapes. They have a mildly sour taste (like sour gummies), which surprised me. I had never had gummy vitamins with this taste before. The texture is good and not weird. They are not super stuck together in the bottle. So far they have been working fine. They kind of make me want other sour sweets, but I usually eat a couple packs of regular fruit snacks and get over it.",

I keep them in a room with temps 65-80 degrees F this season and they are sticking a little to the bottom and each other. So far, I've been able to just shake the container and they come apart. When the humid summer comes, I suspect they might stick a little more and need a fork/knife to dislodge and mix up. They are, thus far, keeping their shape. Store in a non-humid environment for best longevity. They were a good deal and I plan to purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "I've started adding a few supplements to my diet and I really like these Amazon Basics gummies.They taste great and they are so easy to take. They are fresh and soft, unlike some gummy vitamins I've had that were super hard and perhaps stale.I also like the gummy vitamins as opposed to a tablet because I'm never sure if the tablet ever fully dissolves.With these gummies, I'm sure they are dissolved because you chew them before swallowing.They tastes like a berry candy so it would be hard not to like them. LolI added them to my subscriptions so they'll be delivered automatically.I hope this was helpful.",
