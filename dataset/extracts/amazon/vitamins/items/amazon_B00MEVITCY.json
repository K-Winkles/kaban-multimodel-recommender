                "reviewText": "These vitamins are hands down the best men's multi-vitamin I've ever used and I prefer them over GNC Mega Men (my old standby) as they're just more effective for me. I can feel an immediate energy boost and definitely can tell the days I've missed taking them. The packaging suggest taking three, but I only take two and feel like that's extremely effective for me (to be honest three just didn't seemed excessive to me).There are some caveats to this vitamin I feel I should mention, yes it's fantastic and I find it extremely effective. However, the vitamins themselves smell absolutely terrible (do not under any circumstances open the bottle and inhale the smell, it will straight offend your nose). Secondly, they don't taste any better than they smell either. Fortunately the taste doesn't linger for long and you can just pop the tablet(s) in with a mouthful of water and gulp them and that helps. I also think the smell and taste gets worse the closer to empty the bottle gets. That said, I've had no ill effects from the pills at all. I just think they taste and smell horrific, but I didn't buy them for their smell or taste so I can live with that.Overall, I would recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality men's multi-vitamin.",

                "reviewText": "I had been taking a different mega multivitamin for years, but the price kept going up and it wasn't in stock, so I looked at what this vitamin had and found it comparable, so I tried it.A few months later, I'm getting great benefits. I spend a good amount of money on supplements and a great multivitamin is critical to my mental and physical health. This one is packed with lots of great ingredients, including lot of quality B vitamins. When my B vitamin intake is good, I sleep better, have more energy, think more clearly and just generally feel better.I can tell the difference when I'm not getting what I need. This multivitamin is definitely working for me and I'm even saving a little money, so I'm sticking with this one!",
