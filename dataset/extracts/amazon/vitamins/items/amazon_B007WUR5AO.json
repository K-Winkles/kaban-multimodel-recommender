                "reviewText": "After doing a mind-numbing amount of research on the benefits of vitamins and their role in good health, slowing down the effects of aging, skin health, chronic disease prevention, and energy, I've concluded Vitamin C is in the top five if not #1 spot of critical supplements we need to be ingesting daily. I can't possibly put all of the benefits in this review, but urge you to do some research on C and all of the amazing things it does. Next up, I began to research the most bioavailable forms of C, with the goal of saturating my cells with C on an ongoing basis. Liposomal is the way to go. The next task, can I get this incredible vitamin in a bioavailable form, without extra junk, and still have it taste good? Yes. Yes. Yes. In fact, this particular brand is so yummy to me, I could easily go overboard with it. One thing to remember is your body can only absorb about 250-500mg at a time, and studies show cell saturation begins to drop in about five hours, so the best way to take it is about 1/2 tsp every four hours. This totals 4 doses (assuming you sleep for eight hours of your day) and gives you the 2,000 mg daily which was Linus Pauling's recommended daily dosage for the average, healthy individual. If you suffer from particular diseases, you can and should safely take more. The really nice thing about this form, is it bypasses the digestive system which means high doses will not cause tummy upset or the \"big D\" and your body can immediately begin utilizing it. I wish it weren't so expensive, but with vitamins as with most things, you get what you pay for. Love this stuff!",

                "reviewText": "I am very much into health, and love reading up and understanding various vitamins and benefits of supplements, specficailly in relaiton to my skin and keeping myself as youthful as possible. Some of the many benefits of vitamin c include: promoting collagen, healing of scar tissue, slowing down the rate of free radicals, and keeping wrinkles, dryness and fine lines at bay. Among other things, it creates strong nails and hair.I recommend anyone who is very into fitness and health to follow Chris Kresser. There are various forms of vitamin c you can take, but he writes how liposomal is the \"best\" form and most absorbed in the body without other added crap. I normally just squeeze some in a spoon and take it with water, it taste like orange-sickle pop, and I find it pretty yummy. My skin glows when I take it consistently and I believe it contributes to my better mood and higher energy levels.",

                "reviewText": "I have been taking high-dose (14,000mg daily) vitamin C for 26 years. I publish cforyourself.com about vitamin C. This newer liposomal form of vitamin C is astonishing. Due to our system's lost ability to make vitamin C from glucose, our need for vitamin C must be satisfied by what we eat. Unfortunately, our digestive system does not do particularly well using vitamin C from our diets, especially when we are trying to get enough to promote optimum health. Enter liposomal/lypo-spheric vitamin C. These versions allow much more utilization of the vitamin C you take. This is more than just needing to take less. Much of the water-soluble vitamin C we take, especially at higher doses, goes through our systems causing diarrhea-like symptoms. This is not desirable.These non-water soluble forms fix this problem. So much so that they allow much more vitamin C to get into our systems. This can make a huge difference for therapeutic purposes. Personally, I have found this to be amazing. If I start to feel some congestion, I can take 2,000mg of this or the Livon Labs Lypo-spheric C that comes as goo in a packet and my symptoms are gone in 1/2 an hour. If they come back, repeat.This has wide-ranging implications for illnesses, such as cancer, that can oftentimes benefit from very high doses of C, higher than we can get from regular vitamin C.I gave this five stars but I have to tell you that it is not delicious. I found that mixing it with a little orange juice works well, but it still has a slight plastic feel to it and \"lemon zest\" makes it sound much tastier than it is. A very small price to pay for the results.",

It's a liquid that doesn't taste bad at all, and I have no hesitancy in taking it from this reliable manufacturer. Previously, I had taken vitamin C in supplement form, and often skipped taking it. (I have problems with taking too many capsules or caplets at a time, and already take many supplements.) I do think that vitamin C is one of the more important vitamins to make sure you have in your system.You keep this product refrigerated and take it on an empty stomach; I've mostly taken mine early in the morning. Although I need to use some costly digestive enzymes to even hope to properly digest any noticeable amount of food, this Optimal Liposomal Vitamin C doesn't need any enzymes to tolerate - absolutely no unwanted symptoms for me! I wish it were not so expensive, but I'm planning to keep taking it.",

                "reviewText": "I've been taking lypo-spheric vitamin C for the past 2 months which I have to pour out of a packet and into something liquid to take. This, however, I can take straight out of the bottle using a spoon. The lemon taste is real lemon--it is sour, but it masks the awful taste of the liposomal vitamin itself very well.The only question I had was whether I need to keep it in the fridge after opening. My bottle doesn't say. To be on the safe side, I'm keeping mine refrigerated.I would recommend this product to others. It is the easiest form of liposomal Vitamin C to take that I've found.",
