                "reviewText": "My 3yo niece loves these, she actually asks for her vitamin every day! Most people don't really think about it but they are great for adults too. Most adults have some reason or another for not taking vitamins. Often it's because multi-vitamins bother their stomach if they don't take it at the right time or they simply just don't know which to take. Some people start taking them but stop for whatever reason. Once you start taking these, you don't want to stop and you really have no excuse not to take them. I am 31 and I have been taking these for probably about 3 years or so. I have definitely gotten sick much less often and when I do feel a cold coming on, it lasts about 1/3rd of the time. Maybe it's coincidental but overall, taking a vitamin every day definitely has other benefits. I've also turned a few of my friends onto them... They laugh at first but then every time they come over, they grab vitamins (I leave them on the kitchen counter next to the jar of Haribo gummy bears that I never let empty:)). I think 3 of my friends so far have started buying them and all 3 have been taking them for a while. My mom and aunt also take them now. :)The adult dose is the same as the kids over 6 dose, 2/day. Compared to the adult gummies, they have mostly the same amount of each substance. For me, I just know I can take them anytime. I have to eat before I take a multi-vitamin or they bother my stomach--not with these, I can take them anytime and they have no adverse affect on my stomach. They taste great, almost a little sour but not really. My mom loves it because she would just forget to take vitamins. She never forgets to take these, she takes hers when my niece asks for hers. For her, it's one less thing to remember that should could rarely remember before. She also feels like neither she nor my niece get sick quiet as often as they did when they didn't take any vitamins.",

Packaging was sub par - these arrived in a foiled package with a warm ice pack and they had gotten somewhat melty (it was hot on delivery day). My 2 year old likes the flavor, but these are very gummy (like a hard squish gummy), a bit hard to chew into pieces. She still eats them, just not sure how well she chews them up, may have to chop into pieces with a scissors if your kid does not have all of their teeth.",
