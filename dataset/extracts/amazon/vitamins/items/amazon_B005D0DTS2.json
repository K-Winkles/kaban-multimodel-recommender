These essential nutrients are vital for converting food into cellular energy and support nervous system function. There are 8 B vitamins generally included in the B complex: Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), B6 (Pyridoxine), Biotin (B7), Folic Acid (B9), and B12 (Cyanocobalamin). Vitamins B6, B9 (Folic Acid) and B12 are often linked with brain health. They work together to help brain and body cells produce SAM-e, which is important for mood health.+ Adequate intake of B vitamins is especially important for those who experience low energy, eat plant-based diets, and women of childbearing age or pregnant women.+ B vitamins are foundational to whole body health, but various factors can influence how much of these essential nutrients we need and consume daily. For example, Folic Acid (B9) is particularly important for pregnant women and women of childbearing age. Vitamin B12 is important for vegetarians and vegans who may not consume enough from their diet alone. Dietary supplements can help provide essential B vitamins that may be lacking in the diet.+",

                "reviewText": "I decided to start taking a B-complex vitamin after reading about the potential benefits of one - all of the symptoms that can be alleviated by it were symptoms I had, like moodiness, insomnia, low energy, mild depression-type symptoms, decreased concentration and memory, etc. I had chalked these up to having a toddler with irregular sleep patterns, but in retrospect I've had these symptoms for a long time and never could find what the underlying cause was, even with good sleep hygiene, good diet, exercise, etc.I noticed an IMMEDIATE difference in those when I started taking this supplement. I can definitely tell if I miss a dose. I take one tablet first thing in the morning, and I have tons of energy all day long and don't feel completely wiped out after work like I used to. I've never been a \"morning person\" and have always had a really long lag time before I feel like I'm totally awake...not any more! That's just amazing to me. I don't even really need my morning coffee in the morning! I'm quite pleased that it worked for me.I chose Nature Made as I have had good luck with their other supplements (folic acid, iron, vitamin C), in particular the iron supplement. It doesn't upset my stomach or cause an GI issues as is common with iron. B-complex supplements can cause nausea and stomach upset if taken on a empty stomach, but I have not had that experience with this supplement. IThe only negatives are that they smell a little strange (what vitamin doesn't, though?) and they turn your pee fluorescent yellow - but a) no one else sees your pee, and b) it happens because they are water soluble and the body excretes any excess that it doesn't need. It's impossible to get too much B-complex when taken orally because of that. The pills are small, so you don't have to choke down some giant horse pill every day. I also like the flip top cap on Nature Made products - so while the lids are NOT child-proof (so keep them out of reach of little ones!), they are convenient for something that is used every day. The caps are easy to open and close with a satisfying click.This size bottle will last a year, too - so great value for the price.",

But for what\u2019s it\u2019s worth, I understand vitamins in general can do that\u2026. Just something to keep in mind. People eat asparagus even though it has the same side effect so, whatever!!",
