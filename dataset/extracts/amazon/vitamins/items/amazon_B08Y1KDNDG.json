                "reviewText": "Centrum Vitamin/Mineral tablets offer an exceptionally complete combination of the most essential vitamins and minerals, without exceeding recommended dosages. They are very easy on the system, causing no discomfort whatsoever. We especially appreciated the generous amount of Vitamin B-12. These are the only supplements which never trigger our migraines. Definitely effective, over a period of days there is an apparent increase in energy, as well as more beneficial sleep. Very reasonable cost. Highly recommended",

I actually started feeling more upbeat and energetic soon thereafter. I am reserving final judgment, but I am halfway through the bottle and my energy is still in evidence. I expect I will buy another bottle when this one is finished. My hope is that I continue to feel terrific!!",
