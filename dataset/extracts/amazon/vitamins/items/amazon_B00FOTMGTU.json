I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind its gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free formulation, catering to various dietary needs. The convenience of just two capsules a day makes adherence effortless. I've noticed increased energy levels, improved immune support, and enhanced cognitive function since incorporating these vitamins into my routine. Thorne's commitment to quality and purity shines through, making Basic Nutrients 2/Day a trustworthy choice for those seeking a top-notch daily multivitamin supplement.",

                "reviewText": "The reviews for Thorne's multivitamin kill me. I have to admit that I was a little hesitant to order them based on the reviews regarding how wretched they smell. Well, I ordered them anyway because the benefits far outweigh the unpleasant odor they give off. They're vitamins, and they smell like it. Some complained that they tainted whatever cupboard or drawer in which they were stored. This is simply not true. I personally don't mind the smell because they're whole-food, bioavailable vitamins. Take a grocery store multi and toss it in a glass of water and see what happens. Nothing happens because they're formulated from fillers and synthetic compounds. I do have to agree with one reviewer who said that they smell like urine. They sort of do, and it made me laugh. I'll take that smell over chemicals and fillers that your body can't use any day of the week.I have chronic GERD, and the vitamins don't affect it. I can tell the quality of a supplement by that metric alone. I am currently weaning myself off my PPI, and these vitamins still don't aggravate my reflux. Synthetic grocery store brands, on the other hand, make me sick. Plug your nose or take them with a meal. Do what you have to do to get them down.",

These vitamins like other high grade vitamins make me feel more energized and mentally clear in my dat however cost less than some other competitors which is a bonus. Thornes reputation speaks for itself in the clean pure vitamin regard . The smell is simular to other vitamins that I\u2019ve had in the past the really good vitamins all tend to have some stink to them. It doesn\u2019t affect me whatsoever and there\u2019s no flavor to it either no burps that taste like it after etc. no stomach discomfort or gastro issues and I\u2019m fairly sensitive to those things. Will continue to buy.",

The stench immediately filled my cupboard. But if you can tolerate the smell, this really is a great multi-vitamin. I can tell because my pee is neon green :) and I feel good. I was never sure if I was being ripped off with vitamins in the past, but this one is no joke. I would give it 5 stars if it didn\u2019t smell so rotten.",

I also have not even had a sniffle since I started them quite some time ago. I am very impressed by the quality of this vitamin.",

Still i feel this sup is a great way to take the tedium out of your day of making sure you hit values. btw the bottle does have a certain smell, its not bad but its not familiar. it wont effect the flavor of the capsule.",
