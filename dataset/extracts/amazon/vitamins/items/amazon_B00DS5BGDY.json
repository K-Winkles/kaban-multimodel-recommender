These essential nutrients are vital for converting food into cellular energy and support nervous system function. There are 8 B vitamins generally included in the B complex: Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), B6 (Pyridoxine), Biotin (B7), Folic Acid (B9), and B12 (Cyanocobalamin). Vitamins B6, B9 (Folic Acid) and B12 are often linked with brain health. They work together to help brain and body cells produce SAM-e, which is important for mood health.+ Adequate intake of B vitamins is especially important for those who experience low energy, eat plant-based diets, and women of childbearing age or pregnant women.+ B vitamins are foundational to whole body health, but various factors can influence how much of these essential nutrients we need and consume daily. For example, Folic Acid (B9) is particularly important for pregnant women and women of childbearing age. Vitamin B12 is important for vegetarians and vegans who may not consume enough from their diet alone. Dietary supplements can help provide essential B vitamins that may be lacking in the diet.+",

Don\u2019t know why as B12 is a good vitamin to have on board for physical wellness.Love that the pills are small and very easy to swallow.That said, I recently had a hysterectomy and seems almost daily I so many questions post-op with no one to bounce the questions off of. Came across a web-site called \u201cHyster-Sisters\u201d that has been a God-send. While reading the site, the other day, I came across an article that contained a list of minor physical issues a woman may experience whilst recovering from a hysterectomy \u2026 I am experiencing a number of those symptoms. Vitamin B12 was recommended to alleviate these symptoms. So I ordered the B12 to aid in my recovery.Note: As with any supplement \u2026 do the research, talk to your doctor \u2026 especially if you have illness or are taking other meds.",
