                "reviewText": "My doctor said my 18 month old needed to take some Enfamil Iron Drips. Due to her iron being just a tad bit lower than it should be.I struggled with which one of the Enfamil brands to purchase(As there were 3 or 4 of them to choose from. An I found it super confusing with knowing what, if any, difference there was between them. Except for age requirements?)Honestly I was a bit terrified after some of the reviews, comments, & pictures. With the reviews talking about the smell, taste, teeth discoloration, the disgusting pictures of how the liquid itself came or looked, & so on etc!?!So after much debate, reading reviews, & trying to research them all. I decided to go with this one.The Enfamil Active Minds Iron Drops.THE TASTE, SMELL, ETC :After receiving & using this product. I am very pleased with the choice I made. It has been & seems to be great. It doesn\u2019t taste or smell horrible at all!!!Which I smelled & tasted it myself to personally know!(I know this may sound odd, but it slightly reminded me of like a drop of blood??? Or just had a very slight fruity but very earthy like smell & taste??) Regardless though, the smell and taste was nothing bad, horrible, or overbearing at all.Although it\u2019s not flavored or great tasting by any means. As far as being something yummy. It really doesn\u2019t even have much of a smell or taste?I also cannot imagine how it could stain teeth as the liquid is completely clear? So maybe that was pertaining to one of the other Enfamil Iron Drops I was looking at?So that alone is another reason why this one is a great choice. If you\u2019re like me & are trying to decide between which of the Enfamil Iron Drops to go with & purchase.HOW WELL IT WORKS :So I\u2019m not sure about how well it works yet as we have just started using it & will need to go back to the doctors for a retesting of her iron in a month from now.(If I can, and remember to\u2026I\u2019ll try to comment again after knowing her results. As to how well the product worked for us.)So I don\u2019t know about all the other Enfamil choices available. However as far as this product goes. It\u2019s great!!HOW TO USE IT :I just mix it in with her milk or whatever she\u2019s drinking. I add it directly into her cup, either prior to adding her drink in or add it directly to the liquids she\u2019s drinking, & then just shake it up.So far it\u2019s been great, exactly what we needed, and super easy.My little one literally doesn\u2019t even know or notice at all!! I did try giving it to her directly but she did not prefer that at all.(Which I don\u2019t blame her.)While it\u2019s not bad, really too much of a taste of anything, or whatever. The small amount of taste it does have, isn\u2019t something someone would like or prefer to just take. It\u2019s not flavored so it just slightly medicine tasting. (So unless your little one is just a small baby or you can somehow get your little one to take it directly? Then that\u2019s great & maybe that\u2019s the way it will work for you?)Personally I feel mixing it in with a drink of their choice is the way to go. Just to ensure that they take the exact dose & all they need to as directed on the label. In order for it to work properly. As you can\u2019t even taste or tell once it\u2019s mixed in their drink.OVERALL :As far as the Enfamil Active Minds Iron Drops goes\u2026 I think it\u2019s a great product, I\u2019m very pleased, & honestly overall feel relieved now! I feel this was definitely the perfect choice!! Just hope it works once we go back for testing!",

                "reviewText": "Fer-In-Sol is a liquid iron supplement. If I have to make sense of the name then I would guess that Fer is from ferrum/ferrous for iron, and Sol in chemistry means a liquid solution which has fine particles of a solid mixed into it. So Fer-In-Sol seems to mean iron in liquid solution.The liquid form is iron supplement seems to be the easiest to absorb by the body, as compared to other forms of supplements e.g. tablets,syrup, or powder.Our doctor prescribed our son to take Fer-In-Sol after blood-test found him to be anemic. Drinking too much cow milk (more than 24 oz) in a day has been linked iron deficiency (cow's milk hampers iron absorption in body and cow's milk itself is low in iron so the more milk the child drinks the less room will be there for other food that are good sources of iron.)We had to ask our doctor specifically for iron test. Our neighbours had told us that they themselves had to ask explicitly for an iron test and found out that their son had anemia as well.Fer-In-Sol comes with a child-resistant safety cap (that needs to be pressed down in order to open) and a dropper that can also be screwed on top of the bottle. The dropper also has the safety mechanism as well.DOSAGE:Accidental overdose of iron containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Because of the risks and severe side-effects of iron overdose, it is highly recommend to refer the Doctors advise as to how much and if iron supplementation is needed. Our doctor asked us to use two droppers per day.Generally children require between 7-11 mg of iron daily, but because iron absorption is difficult the doctor may prescribe a higher dose than the recommended dietary allowance.DIRECTIONSEven thought Fer-In-Sol has natural flavours, it still doesn't taste good at all. Our doctor had advised us to mix it with juice. We mix the iron supplement with apple juice and use the syringe that comes with Tylenol to feed the supplement to out son.It is recommended to take this in early morning with empty stomach. Also, taking it with juices that conatin Vitamin C is also beneficial since Vitamin C aids in absorption of iron.SIDE EFFECTSTaking supplemental iron has some side-effects (even if taking in quantity prescribed by doctor.) Iron supplement usually causes constipation and bowel movement to be of darker color (almost black.) It can also result in abdominal pain. Therefore it is recommended to drink lots of fluids while on iron supplements.If the child is suffering from iron overdose, he may experience severe vomiting, diarrhea, bluish skin, or general weakness. Therefore it is quite necessary to not overdo it and follow the advise of doctor.",
