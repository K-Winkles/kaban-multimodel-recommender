There were what looked like soft freezer packs in it and then they put them into a soft shipping bag....the packs burst (probably from being thrown around an amazon truck) and the gel was EVERYWHERE!! It took me forever to clean my counter top and the product, and I had to empty them into a container since the original packaging was still slimy.Maybe look into how you ship them, but otherwise love this product!",
