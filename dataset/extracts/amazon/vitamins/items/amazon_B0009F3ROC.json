                "reviewText": "I bought these after reading \"The Chemistry of Joy\" which talks about the benefits of high doses of B6 and B12 for mood and depression. There were also recommended to me by a nutritionist. After taking this my energy levels noticeably increased. This really makes you feel more alive, and my nails grow twice as fast when I take this. I have to cut them every week vs. every two-three weeks, which shows that it really works on your whole body! Now I found this also to be the best multivitamin for when I'm working out. I used these for depression and working out with great results, in combination with Country Life Omega 3 Mood, 1000 mg of EPA/serving, 90 Softgels .The price and vitamin quantity are unbeatable. I bought three packs of the 90 Tablets \"no iron added\" for $6.67 (now it's $12.68 for 90 and $22.09 for 180, which is still a winner).Compared to Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count ($.31/serving at $18.94 for 60 servings), Alive ($.37/serving at $22.09 for 60 servings) has more of vitamins A, C, D, K, and B12, and the same of vitamins E and B6.Compared to GNC MEGA MEN Energy & Metabolism 90 Caplets Multivitamin ($.35/serving at $15.94 for 45 servings), Alive ($.37/serving at $22.09 for 60 servings) has more of vitamins A, C, D, E, and B12, the same of vitamins K and B6, and less of vitamin D (which is still 100% DV).Compared to Nature's Plus - Source Of Life Multi No Iron, 180 tablets (with Whole Food Concentrates, just like Alive) ($.85/serving at $38.29 for 45 servings), Alive ($.37/serving at $22.09 for 60 servings) has more of vitamins A, D, Niacin, B6, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Magnesium, Selenium, Copper, and the same of everything else.Compared to Pure Essence Lifeessence, Tablets, 240-Count ($.83/serving at $50 for 60 days)Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Most complete/comprehensive multi-vitamin I've found so far. I used SuperNutrition brand previously, which is still pretty good, but this has more in it.Excellent vitamin doses(not the absurdly inadequate USRDA doses). 1000mg vitamin C, as just one example.LOTS of great herbal extras: 400mg green food blend(spirulina, chlorella, blue green algae, and many more). 100mg mushroom extract blend. 100mg each vegetable and fruit extract blends. And many many more.Three tablets are the full dose, which is very reasonable based on all the ingredients. They are fairly large tablets, not a problem unless you have trouble swallowing pills, if you do SuperNutrition brand vitamins are a good choice, six tablets are the full dose of them as they are half the size thus very easy to swallow.These have no objectionable taste at all, as some multi's do.All that said I know there is more to vitamin quality than just the ingredient list. Quality of ingredients, digestibility/availability of ingredients, and probably other factors. I'm not a nutritionist or expert. These have the best ingredient list I've found at least. I'd like to hear the opinion of a nutritionist/vitamin expert.Unlike many who claim to \"feel\" the effects of vitamins, I do not, though I certainly believe that a good multi is important for complete nutrition, along with fish oil/omega-3's, and plenty of vitamin-C. Especially if one can't always keep an absolutely ideal diet at all times.So that's my two cents. Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "I cannot find any comparable organic multivitamins so this is the best multivitamin I can find right now. I have looked online, on amazon, in grocery stores, and in a vitamin shop but still did not find a completely organic multivitamn that is made from plants. The multivitamins that I did find that were organic or partially organinc either had unwanted added ingredients or they did not have enough vitamin types or qauntities in them to replace this Alive one that I use. So far, this is the best that there is from what I have seen. Since 2007 I had been researching and doing many different things to get healthy. I used to get sick many times a year and each time it lasted usually a week to a month. Taking vitamins that are made from plants (hopefully uncooked, non-irradiated, non-pasturized, etc) is just one part of the process. I no longer get sick and in the last 4 years I have only been sick for about 1 or 2 days total. thats it, 1 or 2 days in 4 years. That is only because i was not fully taking care of myself during those times. Vitamans alone probably cannot bring me to not being sick, I need to do several other things to get healthy. If I was able to have a professional nutritionist who supplied me with organic meals every day based on the vitamins and minerals that my body needed then I wouldnt even need these vitamins. But because it is difficult to find qaulity organic food to begin with, its even more difficult to be able to afford, find, and prepare all of the food needed to replace a multivitamin. The only vitamins that this brand is lacking for me is Potassium and Calcium. If I dont get enough of either of them then my muscles have hurt or my eyelid twitches. So, I have to eat some organinc bannana each day and I also buy a food-based calcium vitamin. I eat cheese but I still was not getting enough Calcium on some days. I hope this product continues to stay good and does not try to get some of its sources from countries that do not have good pollution standards for food products. Im really not even sure right now where Alive gets all of their sources for this product right now as it is. I do know that I feel ok and I dont seem to feel bad or sick from this. I do need to take them with food or it can make me vomit (because I chew 3 of them up in the morning and it is alot of different vitamins at once in my stomach).",
