                "reviewText": "When I got my labs done earlier this year, my Vit D was deficient at 23 ng/mL. I started using this supplement and retested, and it\u2019s back in normal range at 39 ng/mL! I\u2019m going to keep taking it to get that number even higher, but the numbers don\u2019t lie.In general, I love using Sports Research supplements. They\u2019re priced competitively and I appreciate that they\u2019re third party tested and have no weird filler ingreds.This one is definitely something to add to your supplement regimen.",
