What it doesn\u2019t have is a sugar coating, artificial flavors or the stupid gummy appeal (it\u2019s a vitamin, not candy).I\u2019ve looked all over to find a multivitamin for teens (without sugar & artificial flavors) and Maxi-Health totally delivers! Just read the label and you\u2019ll see all the good stuff inside.Just a few things to know, this doesn\u2019t have the best taste or smell, it\u2019s all natural and plant based. That being stated, my kid has no problems swallowing them and actually prefers them over the gummies I used to get! She feels more energetic since she\u2019s been taking them.This is great for active teens, especially those who are always on the go! This has all the vitamins and nutrients needed to keep going!If you are looking for a vitamin for your teen, try this one. You won\u2019t be disappointed!",

This multi vitamin provides all the basic vitamins/minerals she needs, and I like that it has some added nutrients for optimal health. Taking her daily dose has definitely helped with her issues, she does feel better physically. The capsules are not overly large, and they are easy to swallow. No taste issues, and we\u2019ve never had any issues with quality control. We get them on subscribe and save, which makes it very easy to keep enough on hand now that my second daughter has reached her teen years, as well.",

                "reviewText": "I have been buying the His and Hers bottles of Maxi Teen for at least a couple of years. My son is 14 and my daughter is 12. I like that they are made with natural ingredients and that they are specialized for the gender of the child. I think the capsules are a reasonable size and my kids have no trouble swallowing them. The capsules don't smell and taste great, but the kids don't really spend a lot of time smelling or tasting them. They just drop the capsule in their mouths and take a drink. As far as the His bottle not matching the product description, I'm pretty sure that's just a misprint. The Hers label matches the description of the His bottle in the advertisement, if that makes any sense.Bottom Line: We're really happy with these vitamins, will continue to buy them, and have no complaints.",

My daughter has a hard time swallowing pills as it is and taking two of them seems like a heavy load. Also, they reek. The smell is so strong when you open the bottle and put them in your hand, that the scent lingers long after you\u2019ve put them in your mouth. It makes my daughter gag.",

                "reviewText": "I never leave reviews but this calls for one! I\u2019ve purchased over a dozen kinds of vitamins for my teenage daughter but none like this one. It\u2019s super easy for her to swallow and doesn\u2019t leave the terrible aftertaste. It also doesn\u2019t make her sick to her stomach like a lot of them have. She struggles with hormones out of balance, acne, and overall feeling crummy, not feeling motivated to be active. Her doctor said try a good multivitamin and it\u2019s been a struggle to find one we like, but this is it!!! She feels and looks so much better. My family has even mentioned how much better, healthier, more active she looks and has been since starting this in November 2021. I wish I could leave 100 awesome reviews because this product needs it! Buy it, you won\u2019t regret it!!",

                "reviewText": "By far the best multi vitamin that I have found so far for my teenage boys. They have very healthy diets at home but as everyone with teenagers knows, outside of the home is a different story beyond a parents control! Their hair, skin and nails, energy levels, height and overall health have improved drastically since they have been taking Maxi Teen Supreme. One of my sons has suffered with stomach issues and food sensitivities his entire life and this has been the first multi vitamin that he can keep down and not get severe abdominal pain after taking. They have been very healthy since taking and I would highly recommend this multi vitamin to everyone with teenagers especially with those with food and supplement sensitivities. Very well worth the price. Great product!!!",
