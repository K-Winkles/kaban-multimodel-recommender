Some weren't very good at all and some were good, but overpriced and I think that's the main problem with most vitamin packs on the market today. That's where Planet 3 Vitamins - Core Supplement Pack comes into play. You get a great quality multivitamin pack at a VERY reasonable price. At the time of this review (1/17/24) I just finished my first month of being on them yesterday and I'm definitely feeling better on them than I did off of them. In fact, I feel good enough that the Planet 3 Vitamins - Core Supplement Pack is the ONLY product that I've subscribed to for automatic monthly delivery and that's saying something. They are DEFINITELY worth a try.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been taking vitamins regularly for many years now, so I know the difference between \u201cokay vitamins\u201d and \u201chigh quality\u201d vitamins \u2014 and these are high quality. I noticed many of the minerals in this formulation are \u201cchelated\u201d which I\u2019m surprised the manufacturer doesn\u2019t point out. Chelated minerals are better absorbed by the body. They do point out that the Omega-3 capsule is sustainably sourced and enteric coated. Many people don\u2019t know what enteric coating is\u2026 it\u2019s a process of providing an extra coating on the capsule so it dissolves farther down in the digestive system. This is great for me because when I take my vitamins with a little bit of food, I don\u2019t get any bad taste or odor.Bottom line, I switched to this product primarily because of the quality. Then, when you talk about convenience, it\u2019s a no brainer. I was already taking several of these vitamins anyway and had a bunch of bottles at both my home in the city and at my lake house. Now I just keep a box at each place, and it makes it easy not to forget to take them. Every morning I take them with breakfast and start the day feeling great. I eat pretty healthy, but I consider these vitamin packs a little insurance plan that I get everything that I need.(If you\u2019re on the fence about trying them, once you do try them, you\u2019ll never go back to a bunch of bottled vitamins.)",
