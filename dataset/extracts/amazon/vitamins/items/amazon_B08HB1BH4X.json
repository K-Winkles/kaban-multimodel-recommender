The flavor is pleasant, and these don\u2019t get slimy in the jar. You won\u2019t need a spoon or something else to get the last few of these gummies out of the jar. I bought the multipack after I\u2019d gone through 2 individual bottles of this brand without missing a day.I\u2019ve always struggled with brittle nails and baby thin hair strands that break. My stylist can tell something is different as my breakage areas are growing out and the hair around my face isn\u2019t as delicate as it used to be.Give these a try!",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so while I'm not back to my twenty-something thickness of hair, I don't seem to be losing it as much as I was before these vitamins. I would not call them a miracle vitamin but any little bit of change helps. I think adding the Collagen/Biotin combo is making it better. I am at a year now of taking these and my hair is just now starting to show signs of improvement. I am even noticing my eyebrows are growing back from losing them to stress induced alopecia.You will need to take these for a while before noticing a difference, it will not be an overnight improvement. That is the same with any vitamin to be blunt about it. Anything promoting being an instance success is just not going to be so. Take your time, it will be worth it.",

                "reviewText": "If you like citrus and/or lemon flavors, you'll probably like these as much as I do. No 'artificial' taste at all, just a really good, tangy citrus/lemon flavor. They also have a good texture -- not 'rubbery' like some gummies, but they chew up and dissolve very easily.I've only been taking these for a few days, so I can't say yet if they're helping anything, but at least they taste good, and the price was right, so I'll continue taking them and hope for the best.***EDIT--7/18/21:*** Unfortunately, these didn't work out as well as I had hoped. After taking them for a few days I noticed that they're really upsetting my stomach. Couldn't figure out what was going on and thought it was something I ate, but realized it was only happening on the days I took one of the gummies. Reading up on collagen, it can cause stomach upset/bloating, but the 'peptide' form (aka 'hydrolyzed', which this is supposed to be) is said to not cause this.So I'm wondering if this really *isn't* the peptide/hydrolyzed form or if it's just me. In any event, it's something to be aware of before you start taking this.",
