                "reviewText": "For a couple of years, I kept trying different chewable vitamins and my son never found one he really liked. He literally would go through a different bottle of chewable vitamins every time he ran out as we looked and tried to find something that worked.Eventually I decided to give a swallowable pill multivitamin a try. After reading all the reviews of various children's multivitamins, and wanting to get him one that was whole food based, I decided to give this one a try.What helped me make the decision was reading another review where the mother mentioned her child had also not taken a swallowable pill, and that these were small enough that she was able to get her child to take them successfully.Since my son had never swallowed a pill before, I let him know in advance that we were getting \"big boy\" vitamins that he would learn to swallow. I reassured him that I'd been through this experience before, and even if it wasn't successful the first time, it was something he could learn.We got the vitamins and he was willing to try them. He kept putting the pill on his tongue and then he'd cough it back out. He'd try swallowing some water, then he'd cough that out along with the vitamin. Eventually after about 15 minutes with my continued support and encouragement, he swallowed it successfully. This gave him some confidence and he felt excited and proud about his accomplishment.Then the next day, he successfully swallowed the pill after just a few tries. From there for the next week it was hit or miss. Some days he'd swallow the first time or first few times, other days it took 5 or 10 minutes.His persistence (and mine) paid off. Now almost two months later, I can say that he swallows these vitamins on the first try easily every time. And unlike previous chewable multivitamins, he never complains at all.I think the size is just perfect for kids who are Kindergarten and up... they're big enough to present the challenge of swallowing a pill (as my son experienced), yet small enough that kids can actually do it successfully.",

I was originally having my son chew them because the reviews made it seem like that\u2019s how all these kids are taking them and he acted like they were disgusting\u2026 so, I tried one myself and they are absolutely not chewable vitamins. They do in fact taste horrible. These are meant to be swallowed, not chewed. I do not advise getting these for your child unless they are able to swallow them because if you\u2019re making them chew them, you\u2019re basically torturing them. That\u2019s all.

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for about 6 months for a multi-vitamin that doesn't contain CORN as my son has an allergy to it. I've called numerous companies and come up empty handed because most companies source their vitamin C from corn or use it as an agent to bind the vitamins together or preserve them. I happened to be at the local health food store and looked at the back of this bottle to see how many things I would have to question if I contacted the company and saw on the back that it says \"TESTED TO BE FREE OF: GLUTEN, DAIRY, AND SOY, PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES. DOES NOT CONTAIN CORN OR WHEAT\"If you don't deal with food allergies in your home, then you may not know that companies are only required to acknowledge if their product contains any of the top 8 allergens, and corn is not one of them. So, any company that goes out of their way to label their products free of corn when its not something they need to do, I'm impressed.My son has absolutely no problem swallowing pills, I taught him long ago to do it, since his allergy means no gummies and most chewable tablets are out. If your child is having trouble swallowing pills, we started with my son by giving him a pill in a spoonful of applesauce and if he didn't get it down, I'd give him another spoonfull to swallow while the pill was in his mouth. It took very little effort to get him to swallow pills this way, and the size of this pill is small in comparison to most that he's had to get down.EDIT: I recently purchased a replacement bottle from Amazon and was nervous when the bottle arrived with a new label and the \"Does not contain corn\" line was no longer found on the packaging. I emailed the company to inquire and was informed that it was removed from their label because they do not test for corn to ensure that it is completely free of corn, however, they do not use corn in any of their products or any of their manufacturing processes.",
