                "reviewText": "I trust the GNC brand since it's been around forever. I also trust vitamin C, now that I've researched it on the internet.Even though nobel prize winner Linus Pauling was proven wrong about his claims that it can cure cancer, there has been a lot of talk about how it can cure a wide variety of diseases.While I'm not sure how much faith to put into these claims, I do know that for me, as long as I take two 1000 IU's per day of vitamin C, my allergies are gone. It works the same way for my mother's allergies to her cat. One minute she is sneezing and blowing her nose violently and as soon as she takes a vitamin C, her allergy symptoms come to a halt. It has antihistamine properties.Since this is timed release, it seems to work differently from the usual inexpensive vitamin C pills I get at the drugstore. To be specific, these don't have that kind of immediate effect. I assume that since they are slow release, the vitamin is released so gradually that the effect is blunted, as far as allergies go.But I will say this: I feel a lot healthier when I take this per day. I have only tried taking one per day but soon will increase my experimental doseage to two per day to see how I feel. Since vitamin C is quicly washed out of the body, it doesn't hurt to really load up on it. I suggest to anyone with some mild, diverse physical symptoms of an indeterminate nature or anyone with allergies and asthma to try taking a couple of these per day and see how they feel.I am hoping this isn't washed out of my body as quickly as a regular vitamin C pill would be.I specifically got these since they are timed release. This should provide terrific antioxidant power. I took off one star since I don't get the initial big reaction that regular vitamin C pills give, of clearing my sinuses and making me feel more alert, but these may provide better all day antioxidant protection.The fact that these contain bioflavonoids and rose hips was another important consideration for me in my decision to purchase these.",
