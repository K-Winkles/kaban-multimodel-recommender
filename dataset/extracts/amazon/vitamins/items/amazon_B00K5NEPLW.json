We\u2019re different that way, too. The synthetically created, chemical \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d from huge commercial laboratories around the world are not for us. As fanatical as we are over what goes into our products, we are even more obsessed about the things we keep out of them. We hate those synthetic chemicals that most companies use to make their products. This stuff makes machines work faster, and helps factories churn out super-sized containers at higher \u201cefficiency.\u201d We\u2019re uncompromising about your health. Slow it down, make it by hand, grow it in rich soil with enough sun, air, water and time for it to be its best. Harvest it when ready. Treat it with care.

So, when we create our products, we start by looking at food. What is the \u201cgood stuff\u201d in quality food that we are missing in our diets? Which of those foods have the greatest potential to impact\u2014and empower\u2014extraordinary health? Clean is healthy We start with what goes IN our products\u2014true, whole food ingredients. But we don\u2019t stop there. We also pay very close attention to what we keep OUT of them. And once again, we look at food\u2014real nutrition food. When is the last time you picked up an apple, turned to read the ingredients, and saw a list of chemicals? If it\u2019s not in your food, then we don\u2019t want it in our supplements. Traceability Traceability is key to what makes Garden of Life\u2019s products so special. Traceability starts with knowing where each and every ingredient in our products comes from and getting to know each and every source: where it\u2019s grown; the farming practices; how they pay and treat the farm workers\u2014everything. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to start with fruits and vegetables that are grown without these chemicals.

The flavor and consistency is not great compared to the vitamin B12. I can tolerate the flavor, but I don't think I'll be buying this one again. I also got tested a month after taking this daily, and my D levels were still low. My body doesn't absorb things well, but my vitamin B12 was normal (and I'm taking liquid B12 for that deficiency). I'm going to look for a different liquid vitamin D.",
