Adjustable DPI helps for a person like me with multiple-monitors and task-switching heavily3. Price is on point - worth $10-20 easily. Got mine at $14.994. It's pretty comfortable to use once you get used to it.Dislike:1. Not great for gaming (for me) without extended repetitive use/practice. Movement and response is not perfect but precise enough; however for anyone interested in competitive gaming likely wouldn't purchase this product. For those who enjoy competitive gaming without the leagues and such, would likely be a perfect replacement for a normal style mouse after some time using .2. I frequently use the scroll button for it's general access in opening/closing tabs in web browsers and unfortunately it is awkwardly placed for my sized hand and/or I'm just not used to where it is placed in comparison to a general style mouse.

The texture of the device is soft to the touch and the position of the hand helps a lot specially when you have to spend 8 hours working on your computer. As advertised it helps to avoid that your hand and wrist feel any stress or pain for using the mouse for long periods of time. The DPI option helps a lot if you need to be more accurate and detailed or if you need that it moves the cursor as fast as you want. The changing color feature is mostly for a visual element that has no impact in the function of this mouse but it looks really awesome. This mouse also has go back/go forward buttons on the side to navigate on your internet browser or folders. The only thing bad was that the scroll broke after 2 months of use and it was heart breaking as I use the scroll option a lot in my work.",

Think of this as just the prototype for what you might be contemplating buying in the near future. This is the perfect throw away device (donate, give away, or w/e you want).

I've been working with mice since MS Windows 3.1 and the old standard mouse position I believe has aggravated my right wrist to the point where now, working all day with a standard mouse, in just a few hours my thumb, index and middle fingers go numb. Not so with this mouse.It's set up so that your hand is sorta positioned like you're starting to reach out in a relaxed manner to shake someone's hand. This posture alone has been the relief of my wrist pain. Plus how the buttons and scroll wheel are positioned are well engineered. I like the forward and back buttons on the thumb side too.I have only used this mouse for 3 days and am already benefiting from the design of the mouse. I can use it all day long and not one time, experience numbing of any part of my hand and no pain in my wrist, which used to be very bad at the end of the day.I cannot vouch for the mouse's reliability for I simply haven't used it long enough. So far so good.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this looking for a mouse I could use to prevent cramping and relieve a little hand stress since I work at an office and also use my computer a lot at home for gaming. Tried gaming with it, but it's not got the same hand precision without practice, so I took it to the office in hopes that it would at least mix up my wrist position and relieve any stress on my hand.It worked for a month or so, but I couldn't help but feel like it actually made my hand more crampy. It is a little too smooth like some reviewers have said and the click from the new angle makes it difficult sometimes, so without practice, your finger will find itself not clicking with enough strength (compared to what you're used to).You know that feeling when you shake someone's limp hand? I feel like this shape makes your hand that dead, limp hand form. You're not quite grabbing anything and you never truly feel in control of this mouse. I also found myself massaging my mouse hand after using this mouse, probably more than I ever did with a normal mouse. Something about the limp hand grip seems to ADD rather than reduce tension in my hand.If it were a little wider or something, I can't say for sure. At times I did feel like it was a refreshing new grip, but overall I have decided it's worse or at least not any better.Found myself many times \"tripping\" over the mouse with my arm when reaching around my desk or keyboard since it is much taller than normal.The mouse wheel has also seemingly broke, incredibly, with minimal use. I only use it at the office and scroll occasionally for sheets and pages and I treat my equipment nicely. It is now \"caved in\" to one side and does not register rolls anymore, jiggling around loosely. I don't think I could fix it myself without compromising the mouse itself since it has no real removable layers.It looks cool, has a light, but those are really irrelevant for what I was looking for. Disappointed.Would not recommend.",
