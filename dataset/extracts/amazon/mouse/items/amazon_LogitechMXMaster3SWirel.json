I used the MX Master previously and loved it but the 6 yr old mouse's battery was giving out.The 3S's battery life is impressive and lasts for a long time, so I don\u2019t have to worry about charging it frequently. The Bluethooth is super convenient.The clicks are soft and quiet, which is great for working in a quiet environment. The matte texture of the mouse feels great in my hand and provides a good grip.The mouse is also highly customizable with the Logi Options+ app, which allows me to set up custom button functions and app-specific customizations. Overall, I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a high-quality wireless mouse that\u2019s comfortable to use and highly customizable",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Finally decent scrolling on Windows",
                "reviewText": "Pros:Scrolling 5/5-Scrolling on Windows has always be light years behind Mac - even when using a track pad on Windows vs a stepped scroll wheel, the scroll feels jerky and inconsistent while Macs always feel buttery smooth and fluid no matter what device you use. This mouse with the scroll wheel in free spin \"MagSpeed\" mode is the closest I've ever felt a Windows machine scroll like a Mac. It really is super nice. I almost never put it into the stepped mode. I see a lot of comments talking about inconsistent scrolling on this mouse and I cannot say I have experienced that. For context I am using the Lightspeed connector and not Bluetooth, which I'm sure plays a large factor with the free spin. Let's look at the math behind that. Logitech claims Lightspeed has a 1ms response time, while bluetooth can be as low as 34ms but is often times more around 100-300ms. In \"MagSpeed\" mode at full spin speed, this mouse will do 1000 lines per second. So yes, for your computer to ingest those line signals it's going to need a 1ms response rate. I am also using Logitech's Options+ software which may also play a role in scrolling stability.Ergonomics 4/5-Ergonomics feel really nice to me, but borderline too small. My glove size is between M and L (or 8 and 9), so if you are an L or larger hand maybe this won't work for you, but everyone's comfort is different. The thumb and palm sculpting is really nice and fills the hand nicely (depending on your size). The matte finish texturing also feels nice, I just hope it doesn't deteriorate over time.Logitech Options+ Software 5/5-Being able to program the button map per application is a game changer (for me) and has really improved my work flow. DPI can also be adjusted here.Gesture Button 5/5-The lower thumb \"gesture\" button gives back Mac like gestures to mouse users, something I sorta forgot I was missing but use it all the time now.DPI 5/5-I found out 8k DPI is too high for my monitor, which was one of the deciding factors for me between this and the MX 3. I have a 49inch ultrawide 32:9 ratio monitor at 5120X1440 resolution, and I could feel the lower DPI of my old mouse on this monitor. However this one set to 8k is crazy fast - way too fast - so I currently have it set to 55% speed. Again lets look at the math - if you have a 8k monitor, this mouse set to max DPI is going to get from the left most side of the screen to the right most side in just 1inch of mouse travel. That's fast - you may find that 8K is overkill for your needs. That said, this is all easily adjustable in the Options+ software and it does feel WAY smoother than any mouse or trackpad I've used. I've yet to use this on glass - I'm sure the DPI helps in that regard.Click 4/5-I honestly thought I wouldn't like having a silent click feel, and I like clicky keyboards as well, but it's growing on me. Enough so to make me rethink the type of keyboard I'm using. Click feel and sound ultimately comes down to preference, so all I can say is you feel the click, but it's barely audible. Search youtube or even Amazon reviews, I've seen sound comparisons with this mouse so judge for yourself.Cons:Ergonomics:-The lost point above is due to size - my fourth finger does rest on the desk, which was true of my previous mouse as well so I'm used to it but the experience would be better if there was a rest point or wing on the right side of this mouse. I don't know, this is again preference and hold style but for me I think I would have given a higher score for ergonomics if my pinky didn't touch the desk.Click:-Still on the fence on how silent the click is. Feel is good, sound is... well not there. So if you're used to a satisfying click sound this is going to be jarring.Update 4/13/2023Custom Button Functions by App Glitch:When you use the Logi Options+ software to customize how the buttons function by app, sometimes there are glitches. It's not often, may happen once or twice a week, but it seems to forget how to behave from one app to another, and use the incorrect customized settings for the buttons. While mildly annoying, when I open up the Logi Options+ app, it seems to remember again immediately, or if I'm patient enough it will resolve itself after a few minutes without opening the Logi app. Probably a bug that occurs somewhere along the lines of app switching and having many windows open.",

                "reviewText": "I work all day, every day on a computer. I've had a gaming mouse, an ergonomic mouse, and a vertical mouse. When my latest mouse started to show signs that it was on its way out, I spent a lot of time selecting my next mouse. This one had really good reviews and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. I LOVE it and highly recommend it. If you are in the market for a new mouse, gaming, ergonomic, or otherwise, you will not regret this purchase.Pros:+The shape feels very natural in my hand. I've had intermittent issues with wrist and shoulder, that's why I did the vertical mouse, but so far this one has been very easy on my joints.+It's made with a soft coating to improve grip. I find this very comfortable as long as I come to the desk with a clean hand (Otherwise, it can feel a little sticky. This happens to me with all coated devices, so it might just be me and my personal makeup.).+The controls are smooth and easy to use. I particularly like the scroll wheel when the haptic disengages and allows fast, smooth scrolling. This is essential in my work and I'm glad to have this option.+It holds a charge for at least a week with heavy use. I use it 10-12 hours/day and charge it on Sundays. It has never even gotten close to a low charge.+The weight is perfect. I've had a rather lightweight mouse in the past and kept knocking it off my desk. This one is solidly built with a little extra weight into it.+I haven't taken the time to customize the settings, but the customization option is very attractive. I might program the thumb scroll soon.Cons: None. I cannot say enough positive things about it. It's a little more pricy than other devices, but IMHO it's totally worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a logitech G502x Plus but I found the clicks to be to loud for anything but watching videos, listening to music and gaming but as soon as I tried to look at photographs or web browse without headphones on it was way to loud so I looked online and found the MX Master 3S and wow it sure is quiet and its super relaxing feeling as in absolutely amazing comfort. I like this mouse alot, its great but again the G502x has the right feel for gaming while this mouse is super relaxing and gaming is a gamepad and there loud and that is how loud the G502x mouse is. Id buy the MX Master 3S and watch the leds on the G502x because the led lights are so cool fading in and out but the noise is beyond a reasonable level for browsing without headphones. The MX Master 3S is so quiet id say its the most amazing mouse.After using the MX Master 3S for quite a few hours im really right clicking more than you would think when I don't need to and that might be the only drawback other than the fact that if you wanted to use something more mouse feeling and present when its clicking than you might use a different mouse but so far im preferring that its quiet and not loud but there is something quite mechanical feeling when using the G502x Plus and some people might prefer that and it is nice to look and see the led light on but im also thinking that if the light isn't on you might not turn the led light on during the day to look at it because it doesn't need to be on but is nice to see when its on. Im thinking mouses might be a collectable item to use when your feeling like a specific mouse, you might prefer to use a different mouse for every day that you use a mouse.",
