                "reviewText": "This is a great value mouse for office use. It is quite small and fits entirely in my hand, but feels fine.The buttons are all programmable with the Logitech software. And the battery life is excellent, I only had to change out the battery once or twice a year.However, the sensor on this has room for improvement. It does NOT work on all surfaces, especially surfaces with no pattern or texture, so I needed a mouse pad everywhere I used it. Also do not recommend for gaming or fast movements because of the sensor.Overall, it's a great mouse for office work, especially on the move since it's so small and wireless! Just remember to bring a mouse pad with you :)EDIT: Added some pictures and increased to 4 stars since this is still a great little mouse.",

Still very precise on many surfaces compared with standard optical mice.Battery life is great. The mouse has a power saver feature that it enters after about One minute of not use. I had a set of AA batteries last Two and a half Years in the first model mouse that I bought. There is a LED light on top that tells you when the mouse wakes up from power saving mode after moving the mouse again.High performance and well worth the money.",

I've gone back to my old mouse, which has some problems, but I definitely appreciate it a lot more now lol",
