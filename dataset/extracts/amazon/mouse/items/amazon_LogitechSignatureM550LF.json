                "reviewText": "Mouse arrived, connected to my Windows PC in a few seconds, and as I started to use it I realize I made a mistake when ordering and didn't notice that the M550 model does not have side buttons, which my previous mouse had. I thought to myself \"I can live without those\" but within a couple of hours realized this was a show-stopper. So I returned the M550 and have ordered the M650.In the time I did have it I really liked it (apart from the missing side buttons). Smooth, responsive. I ordered the large size and I have average male sized hands and it was the right size for me.So great mouse, but think carefully whether you need those side buttons before ordering this specific model.",

Apple's mouse was too difficult to use for my wife as she kept inadvertently pressing the right side, not left thus messing up everything she was trying to do. Now with the individual left and right silent buttons as well as the scroll wheel in the center, no more problems. This M550 connected instantly via Bluetooth to the Mac. I didn't need the dongle. We wanted something simple, easy to use, ergonomic for our hands and Logi delivered. Not too big and not too small. It does come with one Duracell AA battery.",
