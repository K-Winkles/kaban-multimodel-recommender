                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Update 2: Customer service reached out to me apologizing and asking if they could send out another mouse. This is a huge gesture and great sign they stand behind their products. I haven't had any issues with the new mouse and I still stand behind my initial positive review and impressions. This is a great mouse and it's refreshing to have an awesome company that stands behind their products. Very impressed and excited to be using this mouse again! Feels great and smooth for gaming and general use. It's so nice to have it looking great with my keyboard and setup as a whole again! Will keep this review updated. Thanks again for the awesome service!Update 1: I don't know if it's just my mouse specifically, (apparently it was after receiving a new one from them that works great.) but after having this mouse for a few weeks I've noticed the battery life is almost not worth it being a wireless mouse. It loses precision quickly and I end up leaving it plugged in most of the time. I've switched to a cheaper wired mouse for now that works better/more consistently.Original review: I've been using this as a general/gaming mouse so far and it's been surprisingly great for the price.It's been hard for me to find a nice wireless white gaming mouse, especially for a good deal. I bought a couple other cheap gaming mice and this one was by far the best for me. The silent but still tactile main buttons feel nice as well as the rubber grippy scroll wheel.It's also light and super smooth on my mouse pad compared to all other mice I've used. This surprised me as a predominant factor in keeping it over the others I tried. It just felt so smooth switching back and forth between others. I haven't had any problems with the wireless signal or double clicks etc. It's been very accurate and lag free so far.I really like the design. Looks clean imo. The only thing I wish was a bit different is the led when it's turned on. it's a little bit off center to the left. I wish the lighting was a little more even all around and even a little brighter. I realize I'm being pretty nitpicky for such a budget and wireless mouse, but I figured I'd throw it out there.It's a lot nicer looking, including the lighting, than the other mice I tried in this budget. I can't find a better one for me on Amazon for under $20. (Especially in white with nerdy LED's haha. There doesn't seem to be a huge selection from what I could find.) Very satisfied with this mouse so far.",

                "reviewText": "For the price that it is this mouse is really good! I like the recharging capabilities and usually will charge it at night when not using my computer. I like the color glow and the extra buttons were more helpful than I thought as this is the first mouse I've used that has extra buttons. I like the soft clicks that it has and overall it fits my hand very well so that it can rest comfortably while using it. The only thing I think could be improved is an battery indicator. The mouse doesn't make any changes to show you when it's battery is low. I had accidentally left it on overnight and even though it entered sleep mode the battery still took quite a hit and I hadn't realized until my mouse was lagging across the screen. So some way to tell when the battery is low so that I know to charge it before using it for the day would be very helpful. There's also the nit pick that the mouse when in sleep mode will not wake up simply by moving it across the track pad and instead you need to click a button to wake it, but that's not too big of a deal for me, though i can imagine for some people who have click sensitive games it could become a little annoying to deal with. Otherwise it works great, the charging via a wire is fantastic and saves me money on batteries, and the glow is a fun :) Overall a great purchase that I do not regret!",
