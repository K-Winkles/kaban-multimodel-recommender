                "reviewText": "After installing an AA battery, I switched the mouse on and pushed the button on the bottom to enable Bluetooth Mode. Once I opened the Bluetooth settings in Windows, the mouse was immediately detected and paired via Bluetooth without issue.Appreciated the fact that it also comes with a Micro Wireless USB dongle for other devices without Bluetooth. The dongle can be away under the battery cover so it's always with the mouse and out of view, and with a push of a Button on the bottom, the mouse switches from Bluetooth mode to Wireless Dongle mode.My only two minor complaints: One downfall of it being incredibly light is that after installing an AA battery, believe it or not, it feels noticeably heavier on one side. Additionally, I was expecting a dark gray/black mouse, but it's a dark blue/green color. Neither of these are issues that constitute a \"Star' reduction.Given the price, and that it supports both Bluetooth or the Micro Wireless USB Dongle, it's a sold value.",

It works well with my father\u2019s laptop.Other reviewers mentioned that it can be dropped a gazillion times without popping open or breaking. I have already dropped it once. It seems to be durable.I purchased the green mouse. Online, it looked like an army color; however, in-person, it is a pretty, Christmas green.It connected immediately with Bluetooth; it also holds one AA battery if you do not have Bluetooth.",
