                "reviewText": "Amazon provides tons of choices when it comes to the wireless computer mouse. However, not all can compete with the Logitech M525. It came down to Logitech M525 and Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX. I took the time to compare the two mouse, but the difference was slight. On the chart provided by Logitech the Anywhere Mouse MX is better than the M525, but I guess it is to the persons preference what they are looking to gain from the mouse. When doing the research I took the following categories into consideration before buying.Travel, Battery Life, Compatibility with Windows & Mac, Mini USB, and Multi Surface Tracking.TravelingMost of the time I am on the road for my company, and I needed a mouse that will fit my needs. The M525 is perfect when it comes to the mini USB. There is no need to take out the USB when putting the laptop into the sleeve of the travel bag.The design of M525 is small and compact so it can be taken anywhere. I was worried that since this is not a full size wireless mouse that my hand will be too big for the mouse, but it is ok fit.I picked M525 over Anywhere Mouse MX because it has better battery life, price difference, and the reviews. I was not looking for advanced mouse, just a simple mouse that I can grab and go.I guess the only drawback that I did not realize is that the M525 does not support backwards and forward on Mac computers.Pro*Small*3 Full years of battery life (depending on usage)*Battery light indicator*Multi surface*Works with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 & 8, Mac, & Linux (I have tested & can confirm that it works great with Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac Book Pro)*Awesome designs*Comes with 2 AA batteries* Amazing optical tracking! The cursor does not run away.Cons*Does not support backwards and forward on Mac computers*Not the best comfort fit for your hand, since its smaller*M525 requires 2 AA batteries so if you are used to M305 which only requires 1 AA battery that might be a drawback for you.* Scroll wheel. I wish it had resistance not just smooth scrolling",

                "reviewText": "Logitech is known for their outstanding products, and this mouse appears to be rugged, stylish, and very functional!Its a bit smaller than my M510 and not quite as \"comfortable\", but being compact, I expect it to feel a bit different than a full-size mouse. It definitely feels better than the M305 or M505The stripes on the side add a touch of style, but they are \"slick\"... I would rather have the rubberized grip full-length of the sides, rather than in front and behind the stripe.Scroll wheel is very smooth and \"light\" touch... rather then feeling the \"deep clicks\" of the scroll on the M510 or M310, this one is very sensitive and can easily scroll \"fast\". The texture of the scroll wheel is very nice and grips well for vertical or horizontal scrolling.There are no \"forward/back\" buttons on the left side of the mouse, like the M510/710, but I knew that before ordering... no biggie, but you'd think Logitech would make those standard on all but their most basic lines.Mouse is very responsive and works on pretty much any smooth surface (at least any I've tried so far).Battery compartment is easy to open (release button on bottom of mouse), and the batteries (included, but not Duracell like normally included with Logitech devices) install easily. There is also a storage slot for the nano receiver... but most people will just leave it plugged into the computer/laptop. Syncing the device was a breeze... plugged in the receiver and after a few seconds, it recognized this mouse, as well as my M510 and K350 keyboard, which were both in the same room. Selection of devices to sync with was a breeze... click and go.All in all, a great mouse for travel with my laptop, and I won't have to worry about batteries for at least a couple of years, even if I forget to turn it off before tossing it into the bag. I would have preferred a satin finish, rather than the shiny/slick finish, but that is just a matter of preference... does not affect function and does not appear to show finger-prints like you'd expect a shiny finish to do.UPDATE:I've been using this mouse for nearly a year, and suddenly it stopped working. After some troubleshooting on my own, I found the Unified Receiver to be the fault. I contacted Logitech, and after speaking with them for only 3-4 minutes, they shipped out a new Unified Receiver! FANTASTIC customer service dept.! The new receiver arrived in a couple of days, and my mouse is happily scooting and scrolling along again!",

                "reviewText": "I am on a computer all day long and know what a good mouse feels like. This is a good mouse, and is very responsive and a good value for the money. Definitely get the free logitech software that lets you assign the buttons that will really speed up your workflow for copying and pasting or doing any repetitive activity. Works well with my full-size Logitech keyboard. Lastly, I really like the unifying receiver and allows you to easily set it up to use any combination of keyboard and mouse on any computer. Here\u2019s an example of useful scenario. I have two mice programmed to the same receiver. If my child is working on their computer and they need some assistance from me, I just have an extra mouse that I can use to control their computer so I don\u2019t have to pass the miles back-and-forth between two people. Particularly useful if you connect the computer to a television allowing either of you to control the cursor with your own mouse",

                "reviewText": "Had Logitech V450 Nano for about 15 years, used it almost daily (including numerous accidents - falling off desks, having water spilt on him) and alas, he has moved to the mouse house in the sky now.So pleased I managed to find this one - the same shape and weight! Works just the same, simple three buttons (left, right, middle one scrolls and clicks). Battery life is excellent. Nice and solid little mouse (I have small hands so this is great). The dongle fits inside it for when travelling. And the red colour makes it stand out so it doesn't get pinched when visiting the office. Highly recommended.",
