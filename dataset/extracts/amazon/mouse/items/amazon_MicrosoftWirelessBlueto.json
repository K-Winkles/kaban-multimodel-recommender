It works on any surface! No more hunting for the perfect mouse pad \u2013 this mouse is all-terrain, all the time.Now, here's a pro tip: keep the mouse in its original box. I've repurposed mine by adding a little tape for easy opening and closing. It's like having a custom storage solution that's both practical and convenient.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this mouse. It's reliable, versatile, and just downright impressive. If you're in the market for a new mouse, look no further \u2013 this one's a winner.",

First I purchased two other Amazon computer mouse and neither one connected to my Macbook Air...even after many attempts pairing just wouldn't connect. This Microsoft Modern Mobile Mouse connected instantly to my Macbook Air M1. These are the steps to pair your mouse to your computer-take off mouse battery door-secure batteries-put battery door back on-mouse will flash blue-go into settings on your computer or MacBook-click bluetooth-Microsoft Modern Mouse should pop up in the drop down window-click to connect and that's it. This mouse feels nice to touch, very smooth and quality. It comes with two preinstalled Duracell batteries which is great. The battery door is almost like a magnet..pops right on after securing batteries. The stroll wheel is aluminum which is smooth. Not a deal breaker for me but there is no on/off switch to turn the mouse off...I'm assuming the mouse sleeps when not in use to conserve battery life. It's lightweight, portable design, wireless and bluetooth. It's compatible with windows and Macbook Air M1. I highly recommend this Microsoft Mouse and it will connect with pairing to your computer, instantly.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A simple Bluetooth mouse with stepping scrolling wheel - just what I wanted",
                "reviewText": "I was very skeptical at first regarding this mouse as I read in one of the reviews here that it does not have an ON / OFF switch, which can lead to quick draining of the batteries. But I was glad to find that the single button with the Bluetooth symbol at the bottom of the mouse actually IS an ON / OFF switch. :) It's very misleading when you're only familiar with moveable switches of other brands and consider any clickable button with a Bluetooth symbol as pairing button.Anyway, this mouse is very minimalist, simple and it works just fine. The main thing I really like about this mouse is that its scrolling wheel is a stepping wheel - meaning that you can feel the steps while you scroll. Some people don't like it and prefer \"butter\" smooth scrolling wheels, but I find those wheels inaccurate when you do precious work. So stepping wheel for me is a big plus.Just like the Surface Pen, this mouse runs on batteries. And I prefer it better over built-in Lithium batteries that need to be recharged every now and then, making you need to carry a charging cable with you all the time. In this case, when you're starting to feel lags during use you just go to the grocery store and buy a pair of batteries and you're good for the next couple of months.Now it terms of the color - I read in some places that just like me, others are spending a lot of time thinking what color to pick; let it be the Type Cover keyboard, The Pen or the mouse. I too spent a lot of time thinking about this, and eventually decided to go with the black one, and the reason was because I went with the black Type Cover keyboard, which also led me to pick a black Surface Pen. But in the bottom line it's just a color and it doesn't affect anything but your brain. ;) You can have the Surface accessories all in the same color, or a combination of them all. It's really a matter of taste.",
