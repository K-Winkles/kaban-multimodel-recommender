                "reviewText": "I needed to replace a broken mouse for my home computer. The one that I used to have doesn't seem to be available any longer.I was looking for an inexpensive basic 3-button wired mouse that is comfortable to use all day long. I like big mice, to put all my hand on in a relaxed position, and not have to clutch it. After trying out several different ones, which were adequate but still not what I was looking for, I got myself the same mouse that is provided for me in my office, and I love it.It is reasonably large - well, at least it is hard to find a larger one which also has other features I was looking for. It is simple not only in the sense of being a 3-button no-frills wired mouse, but also in the design made of straight parallel lines with a round wheel and a low profile. It doesn't make claims of being ergonomic, but it is very comfortable for my hand, placing all the fingers where they are supposed to be, and I easily move it with just my fingers, leaving my wrist rest on the desk, just the way I like it. It doesn't make claims of being noiseless, but it is reasonably quiet - not completely silent, but providing a relatively low clicking feedback sound that doesn't bother me at all. It works well without a mouse pad, so I don't need to clutter my precious desk real estate with it. Haven't experienced any problems with this mouse at home or in the office, it just works.This one is a keeper.",
