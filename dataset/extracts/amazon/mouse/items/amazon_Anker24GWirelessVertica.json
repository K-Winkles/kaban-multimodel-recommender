                "reviewText": "I've tried many differnet 'ergonomic' mice over the years and have never felt comfortable with any of them. This vertical concept by Anker changes the game. I was hesitant to purchase due to all the failures in the past, but reviews were basically good and the price was great. I didn't expect much, so much to my surprise it was a go from out of the box! To hold the mouse this way is revolutionary. Such a simple design, whover came up with this was a genius. It's basically a standard mouse turned on it's side. No crazy rolling track balls or funky bumps or twists. Some of the ergonomic choices out there look like they were inspired by the look of an armadillo. This sleek and modern design is so easy to hold and use, you will be questioning why the original mouse wasn't designed this way. I have early stages of arthritis so this purchase is really a game changer for me. I would recommned this mouse to anyone who uses a mouse regulary and suffers from hand, wrist and finger pain. Kudos to Anker, well designed and slick looking. Doesn't look like an $18 mouse, I will tell you that for sure. I would have paid $49-$69 for it and felt like it was a fair price.Don't hesitate to give it a try if your hands are tired of the standard mouse design. I've purchased other products by Anker and for the price, they have all been well made with sleek, upscale design.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Decent Office Mouse",
                "reviewText": "I got this mouse because I wanted to try an ergonomic office mouse to relieve pressure on my wrists, and I will say that it has decreased the fatigue of long usage sessions. Overall, a decent mouse for the money, but not perfect either. It is pretty ligthweight, so it is easy to move around, but beware that the sharp edges on the glide pads at the bottom of the mouse dig into a fabric surface like a mousepad, decreasing the speed of movement, as well as increasing wear on the mousepad. It is comfortable in the hand, and all buttons are accessible, but rarely in the way, preempting misinputs. The fact that it is wireless is a huge plus, although I will say that being wireless, this mouse suffers in responsiveness, especially at high mouse sensitivity settings. That will make fine movements, like highlighting text, a challenge as it will jump from one spot to another. This can be very frustrating for office work. The DPI's are more or less in the advertised range. After rigorous and meticulous testing, I have found the mouse to be capable of ~750, ~1240, and ~1500 DPI on the respective settings. If you are okay with having a wired mouse and need high sensitivity I would strongly recommend getting the wired version of this mouse instead, the AK-98ANWVM-BA. But if you require a wireless setup and prefer lower mouse sensitivity, this mouse will be more than adequate. Just make sure not to use the highest DPI setting, as that will increase sensitivity by a huge margin. Overall, Anker has once again made an affordable, yet adequate product.",

I'm 6'3 and have pretty big hands, and it was a nice size and weight, especially with the batteries in place to make it feel a little heavier. The button clicks are nice and snappy, and it seems like a great mouse for the price.The only frustration that I ran into is that since I primarily use 3D modeling apps, I have to click and hold the middle mouse button a lot for viewport navigation, but the middle button placed just a tiny bit too low and I have to skew my index finger trying to reach it until it became pretty uncomfortable. But that's a very specific use, and I'd definitely still give this mouse 5 stars as a great performer for normal use, and even for using the middle button as a typical scroll wheel.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this refurbished in September 2022. It\u2019s now November 2023. The scroll on the mouse is pointless at this point, and has been for the past few months. Whenever I scroll, it does the opposite on the screen and bounces around and is unreliable to actually scroll in the direction you\u2019re intending, and you find that your better off moving your mouse to the scroll bar or arrows to move up/down a page. So now I\u2019m in the market for another mouse after only a year.That said, the ergonomics of the mouse are wonderful. Very easy to get acclimated to and it definitely made the soreness I had been experiencing in my wrist disappear for the most part. So this issue with the scroll really has me disappointed.",

Zwar kann ich in der kurzen Zeit (ca. 1 Woche) noch viel berichten, dennoch habe ich festgestellt, dass meine Hand sich am Abend leichter bewegen l\u00e4sst. Ich jedenfalls bin zufrieden damit.",
