                "reviewText": "I've had a Microsoft Surface ergonomic mouse on my desk for years now. I love it. It's my favorite mouse.After trying to go cheap on the bluetooth mouse I keep in my laptop bag and having it fail before the first set of batteries needed replaced (less than a year), I decided to go back to a recognizable brand and was surprised to see a non-Surface Microsoft bluetooth mouse that looked almost identical to the mouse on my desk, and for a good price. I bought it, and I'm glad I found it. It costs about twice what my previous cheap Chinese mouse cost, but this one is far more comfortable and should last several years, ultimately making it a better deal than those questionable unknown-brands that are practically disposable.The only differences that I can tell so far between this and my Surface ergonomic mouse are the lack of scroll function button (switches between smooth and detent), less premium materials (still plenty good!), and no rechargeable battery. Oh, also, this one can be paired with three different devices and switched between them with a button on the bottom of the mouse.. I think my Surface mouse is limited to two devices.Truthfully, if my Surface mouse failed today, I'd happily replace it with one of these. I don't like smooth scroll wheels, I am satisfied with the materials on this mouse, and I actually prefer replaceable batteries.For a very fair price, this is a no-brainer. Just get this one. Don't bother with those cheap unknown-brands--they'll cost you more in the long run by having to be replaced so often.",

                "reviewText": "Updated: So I gave this mouse another try, seems to work well. I don't believe the mouse was causing the pain. So I changed the review back to 5 stars, would recommend this mouse as it's very easy to use, comfortable and very easy to connect.Build quality feel really nice, no unusual noise when using. The feel of the plastic is quite nice. The metal scroll wheel feel nice and premium.Ease of use is really easy on a Windows 10 machine with bluetooth. Basically turn it on, Windows detects it and your off. The software works well, isn't intrusive and is we'll laid out. There is an option to change the DPI up to 2400.Comfort for me wasn't what I was expecting. I really liked the style and even some of the comfort features. For me personally, the thumb rest caused an unusual amount of pain under my thumb. If it wasn't for that thumb rest, this would certainly be a 5 star other and I'd still be using it.Ultimately, I had to return this as I was not comfortable when using this. I would still recommend as long as your grip isn't like mine. I'm guessing I have a lazy claw grip and at times a fingertip grip. I was very disappointed this didn't work for me as it's overall a wonderful mouse.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best mouse I have ever had. Bluetooth is so much better than USB. All of the buttons are fully user programmable and can work on up to three different computers, with the click of a button. The wheel is silent, and it is ergonomic, it is the perfect hand size with a thumb rest. I am still using the first three that I bought in 2021, one for home, one for work and one for my husband's laptop. I like them so much that I bought two more as back-ups. I haven't needed them yet, but I want to make sure that if they are discontinued, I have replacements.The batteries last about 6 months for me and I never \"shut them off\" because my mouse pad that I have was dragging on the switch and turning it off, I just put a piece of scotch tape over the switch to prevent my mouse pad from shutting it off inadvertently. I have the light blue, peach and black colors and the light blue one does stain, but it is less noticeable on the black and peach colors. Not a deal breaker, I can easily live with that.",

                "reviewText": "Microsoft makes solid products for productivity/office. I have a Logitech MX Master and this isn't quite as premium feeling and missing some additional buttons but it's a great 2nd or budget mouse particularly if you don't need all the extra buttons and 2nd scroll wheel. For example, the main scroll wheel is less solid feeling than the MX Master at 2x to 3x the price. A big plus is the Peach color which is Pantone's 2024 Color of the Year so you can keep being a slave to fashion. Highly recommended for value if you don't need top of the line accessories and the functionality of multiple programable buttons. This full-size mouse has good ergonomics but again compared to the much more expansive MX Master, I wish the thumb rest was a little larger. No complaints from a functionality standpoint, very smooth minimalist design, and does feel solid for the price.",

                "reviewText": "With the pop-up \"Keyboard and Mouse Center\" software installed, I found this mouse to have a lot of input latency (delay), be generally inaccurate, and have very inconsistent movement sensitivity. It also caused at least one very odd issue with Excel, where \"inserting copied cells\" would add hundreds of thousands of columns of the same data to the sheet.After un-pairing it, removing the software, and re-pairing the mouse, I found the experience much improved. There is still a small amount of latency - expected in a Bluetooth device of any kind - but otherwise operation is much more consistent.",

After a year and a half using it, still on the first battery installed, using it everyday.Ergonomics are good and feeling on the skin is too. The mouse is lighter than a similar priced Logitech mouse.This is not a mouse designed for gaming but can do the job for most games.Only downside is that the scrolling is only incremental, and I really like a free spin scrolling.",

Also, the button to change the mouse to another devise (up to 3) is tiny and on the bottom. I have been buying Microsoft products since 1995, including 3 Surfaces, Office 95 all the way to Office 2019, plus many mice and keyboards. This is the first time I have ever returned a Microsoft product. I am disappointed with Microsoft on this product and ended up buying a Logitech M720 Triathlon Multi-Device Wireless Mouse. Very quiet buttons and very easy to change between devices with a large button on top and each number lights up to show which device. Very fast interchange.",
