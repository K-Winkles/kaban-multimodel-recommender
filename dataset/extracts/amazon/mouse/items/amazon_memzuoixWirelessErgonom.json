                "reviewText": "I love this mouse! I was used to carpal tunnel from previous mice, and my fingers would start cramping when I did a lot of editing at once... I'd have to rest them... stretch them out... then start again. This mouse has yet to cause my fingers to cramp even after hours of use. It's very responsive and recovers quickly after sleep mode.The only thing, and it's not a defect, but my index finger occasionally gets lazy and presses the clicker directly below it at random times. With a regular mouse this was rare, but with this one and it's 2 inch height, it happens more. Not a huge issue considering I no longer have carpal tunnel in my mouse hand! I don't use it for gaming, but do use it for meticulous photo and video editing. Awesome feel and comfort and response! Love it!* Update * After a couple months use, I am noticing the cursor lagging a bit, and stopping some. Occasionally it'll just stop mid movement. At first I thought it was my finger slightly slipping, but it's happening a lot. Dragging something across the screen and it'll let go mid-way. I tried changing the batteries, no difference, it's becoming annoying. I haven't had one of these vertical mice before, I'm wondering about getting another one to compare... will update one way or the other.* Update * So I purchased another very similar mouse to compare, the \"VicTsing Ergonomic Mouse\". Turns out being installed UNDER my desk was causing my \"lag\" in the Memzuoix. Now moved to a USB hub beside the mouse and w the lagging behind me, I continued to compare the two. The VicTsing doesn't feel nearly as stout as this Memzuoix mouse. There is just something that feels \"cheaper\" w/ the VicTsing. Advantage = Memzuoix Even though they look exactly the same, the VicTsing is ever-so-slightly taller, and I like that better for my large hands. Advantage = VicTsing However, the VicTsing doesn't have the extra \"rubber like\" grip where the thumb goes. Love that on the Memzuoix. Advantage = Memzuoix The buttons on the Memzuoix are ever-so-slightly more sensitive which means I get a lot of \"accidental presses\" from resting my finger even slightly and accidentally pressing a button, not so on the VicTsing. Advantage = VicTsing Now that I fixed the \"lagging\", they are equally responsive and accurate. Advantage = none They are about the same price, though the Memzuoix is slightly less. Advantage = Memzuoix I doubt either are made in USA. Advantage = none So which will I choose to use? I like the rubberized thumb grip, but like the ever-so-slightly taller profile of the VicTsing. With my bigger stronger hands and less accidental button presses, I will be using the VicTsing. If you don't have big hands, I'd recommend the Memzuoix.* Update * After a few weeks using the VicTsing, it's scroll wheel started to squeak, and it started missing clicks, I had to re-click often. Back to using the Memzuoix. Working flawlessly so far.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a similar ergo mouse years ago and loved it. When it finally began to wear out, I struggled to find one with the same shape. Most are actually quite awkward as they tend to slip forward out of your hand. This one is a perfect clone of my original. The geometry is just right, it stays put comfortably in the pocket of your palm. This really has helped with CT issues that were being aggravated due to hours of CAD work. I will probably buy a few extras and store them away, as this is going to be my go-to mouse for the foreseeable future.",

                "reviewText": "When I first started looking for vertical mice -- and I highly recommend switching, one review I saw recommended trying 4 different ones to find the right fit. I scoffed at first. A month later, I've tried 5. I'll outline what I tried and the pros/cons. For reference, my hand is medium-sized, 6.75 inches from base of palm to tip of middle finger.Anker's popular model: the biggest of all the mice I tried. Too big for my hand. Never felt comfortable, and the cursor tracking felt clunky.Jelly Comb for small hands and rechargeable version: Though they are listed at slightly different measurements, they are the exactly same size. This was my runner-up. Very smooth and ergonomic, just slightly too small. I found my palm wanted a half-inch more length to not have to clamp my fingers around it for purchase. But I'd recommend this one over the Memz for small hands. Also takes only one AA battery as opposed to two AAAs for all the others. Honestly I miss the sound and feel of the buttons with that one. Very crisp.Jelly Comb black/silver bluetooth dealie: Though this was the perfect size for my hand, it didn't feel comfortable, mostly because of the button placements. The scroll wheel was especially awkward, and the back button didn't always register. Also felt the cheapest overall.The Memz: I rather like the purple and the grip feel of it, as well as the texture thumb rest. I'm a tactile person, so that was a nice touch. It feels great in my hand. Slightly too big, but of all of them, the best fit. The tracking is spot on and the buttons are well placed and register all of my intents. So it wasn't a standout in any category, it was more of a jack of all trades.But now I'll be the lame-o recommending that you try as many as you can.",
