The main problems have been severe USB lag, and battery life.I bought this one to try a blue tooth version. I was surprised at the results.It paired immediately and just started working . No lag at all. It uses a AA battery instead of AAA. So far, I haven't had to change it. It has an automatic battery save mode when not in use.It is a little larger than I personally like, but So far it has met all of my expectations.It is comfortable to use, very precise tracking, and positive key clicksI am quite happy with this device and hope that it is th end of my search!!",

                "reviewText": "I'm very torn between whether to give this mouse a 5-star review.I like everything about it: comfort, usability, stability, responsiveness.The size of this is perfect for my hand size. It's compact to fit in small pockets and sizable enough to fill my hand, preventing cramping up.The mouse connects very easily and seamlessly connects to my MacBook (when it's the only one of it's kind registered to it, see more info lower in my review). Battery life was decent-- I never paid attention to how long batteries lasted but I would say something like 3 weeks?Given this is a travel mouse, the build quality feels nice and solid, The buttons have a nice click to them. I've had other travel mice made by Logitech, and this feels like a step up from the quality they usually have (already pretty solid).I tend to set my mouse responsiveness pretty high (my co-workers, who have had to commandeer my mouse a few times, would agree with me!) the overall responsiveness is pretty fast and quick, too. No jittering or lagging. Probably enough to play a decent game if you happened to forget your usual gaming mouse.Hang-Ups:I decided a few months later to buy another one for when I'm at work (I kept forgetting to pack my mouse!) The connectivity gets weird when you have 2 mouses (mice? meese?) registered with the same laptop. Whenever I'd bring the alternate mouse to work, I'd have to put the mouse back into search mode, and reconnect it. Again, this is due to me being forgetful and needing a second one in the first place!So here's my biggest hang-up: my first one died after 2 1/2 years of use. I'm honestly not sure if this is even valid, as I've only had a few travel bluetooth mice in my time, but my very first one (also made by Logitech) is at least 7 years old, and it still works like the first day I got it (although it's just not as good as this one). 2 1/2 years sounds awfully short for a mouse, though.In the end, I'm very tempted to buy yet another one for work (to replace the one that died). Still haven't decided.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mouse on impulse. I have an M557 paired to my laptop that has been serving me well for a few years now, but I like the design of Logitech's new mice (I have an M330 Silent that I use with my desktop that I absolutely love and if they release a \"Silent\" version of this mouse, I'm getting it!).I had no issues pairing the M535 with my Asus laptop and all functions/features respond well. This mouse is configured by the new Logitech Options software which feels a lot more simplified than the original SetPoint software. The button configuration is good as is, but I like to have the center mouse button pull up the Start Menu, so that was the only change. The sensor is accurate and properly responsive. I prefer a quicker mouse pointer, so a small increase there and I'm golden.It's definitely a travel size mouse, about the same size as the M557 only differing in the shape and texture. The matte finish on the buttons and rubberized surround give it a great in-hand feel. Like most Logitech mice it tracks smoothly (especially on my gaming mouse pad which is geared toward low friction). It is certainly lighter than the M557, as it only seats a single AA battery as opposed to the pair used by the M557. This is a subjective characteristic though, as users will differ in their preference regarding weight.On the subject of connectivity, I think I've already sorted all of that out with the M557. I used to experience dropped connections, but after searching onilne, I found a remedy focusing on the OS's networking and Bluetooth settings, preventing power and connections to be disabled (for battery savings and performance). With that in mind, the M535 has performed well and has never missed a movement or click.The main reason I opt for Bluetooth mice on my laptop, as many do, is to keep the USB ports free. This mouse, like the one before it, serves this purpose exactly. For anyone interested, make sure that your laptop/desktop is Bluetooth capable, otherwise you'll end up having to buy a separate Bluetooth dongle to connect the mouse, thus defeating the purpose of keeping the ports free. If this is the case, look into the M335, it's the same mouse using Logitech's wireless nano USB receiver.",

Niente chiavetta usb, niente wifi.Uno dei pochissimi mouse con ottimo laser e con solo la connessione bluetooth (senza quella fastidiosa pennetta usb, che oltre a perdersi e rompersi consuma pure di pi\u00f9).- Ha solo la connessione Bluetooth- Funziona sia di Windows che su macOS. Dovrei testarlo su Linux\u2026- Si alimenta con una pila AA (a differenza dell\u2019Apple Magic Mouse, che di magico ha solo il design ed ha un sistema di batteria e ricarica ridicolo), ma all\u2019interno della confezione \u00e8 gi\u00e0 in dotazione una pila Duracell.Durata dichiarata della batteria: 10 mesi.Questo, per il quanto mi riguarda, vale i 39,24\u20ac spesi per acquistarlo.Testato su Macbook Air con macOS Ventura 13.5 e chip Intel: funzionano bene sia il tasto sinistro, che il tasto destro, che la rotellina.Dalle impostazioni del mac si possono addirittura modificare il verso dello scorrimento della rotellina e altri settaggi.Il pairing \u00e8 stato immediato, \u00e8 bastato andare sulla schermata \u201cbluetooth\u201d, senza installare driver, ma cliccare su \u201cConnetti\u201d vicino al nuovo dispositivo chiamato \u201cMouse\u201d.Per ora pienamente soddisfatto.

                "reviewText": "Amazing Bluetooth mouse! Don't let the simplistic look fool you, it is packed with amazing features. Although it doesn't have side buttons to go back or forward, you can do that by pushing the scrolling wheel to the left or right. With that feature who needs extra buttons...The scrolling wheel is fantastic, my favorite, extremely accurate and it doesn't skip or unexpectedly jumps up or down, it is as smooth as you'd expect. It's like driving a Mercedes :-)Another great feature (another favorite) is the square button in front of the wheel. If you're multitasking and have multiple programs open up and want to switch between them, just press it, and you'll see a stripe with all the programs that are opened, select the one you need, and you're done! No need to go to tack bar anymore. A huge time saver for busy or multitasking people.It is fast and I haven't noticed any lag. In fact, it is as fast as any USB hardwired mouse. There is absolutely no difference.It is small but not too small, perfect for a regular office/home use or to travel with it. Very comfortable, the universal design is perfect for anyone, no matter if you're left or right-handed. The clicks don't make a lot of sounds, and the scrolling wheel is virtually silent.Pairing it on Windows 10 takes less than a minute, just open up your Bluetooth settings, click the + sign to add a new device, select the mouse, click done and that's it.I've bought it to free up my USB port, but regarding features and functionalities, it exceeded my expectations. It is on the more expensive side but totally worth it. There are cheaper products like this one out there but don't fall for this 'cheap' trap as many of them are made from poor quality plastic and after a few weeks of use will act up especially the scrolling wheel, it basically becomes unusable. Been there, done that. With this one, you pay a bit more, but you'll enjoy it for a long time, and you'll save yourself some frustrations.I wish it had an automatic turn off feature let's say after 20 or 30 min. of inactivity. It has a so-called sleep function but an automatic turn off feature would extend the battery life. Some of the cheaper products do offer it to lure customers but be careful as they often fall short on quality.All in all, very well made quality product from a well-known brand worth every penny.",
