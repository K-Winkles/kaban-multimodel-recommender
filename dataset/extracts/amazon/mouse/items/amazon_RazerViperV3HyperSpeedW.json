                "reviewText": "To begin- I should state that I've been in the mouse community for a few years now and I've purchased mice from many different brands, big or relatively little. I've used Razer, Logitech, SteelSeries, Zowie, Corsair, Glorious, Pulsar, etc.I always seem to find myself coming back to either Razer or Logitech for specific needs that other brands don't necessarily offer.I have a lengthy history with Razer products, and that includes their Viper line of mice. I've owned the original, the mini, the ultimate edition, the 8khz wired release, as well as the Viper V2 Pro. There was one thing that kept my away from these mice for so long- shape.The original Viper mice, while excellent, weren't good for me comfort wise. The hump wasn't pronounced enough, and the curvature on the sides would cramp my hand every single time. I know, I know- why keep buying a mouse with a shape that makes you uncomfortable? Best answer: I like symmetrical mice, and other than shape, the Viper was/is amazing.Enter the V3 Hyperspeed!I was leaning towards 4.5 stars, but since I can't post a half star I'm comfortable rounding up. The V3 boasts a few changes that, in my personal opinion, are upgrades.The sides of the mouse are less aggressive with their curvature and I found them to be much more comfortable for my hands which are roughly 20x11. They've also done away with any worry of your ring finger clipping the side of your secondary click. They gave this mouse the same treatment the Deathadder V3 pro received.Weight isn't bad at all. It's around 82-83 grams with the included alkaline aa battery. I was able to get it down to a comfortable 70ish by using a lithium aaa and a separate aaa to aa conversion kit. This can be reduced even further by placing a small piece of aluminum foil between the battery(+) and the mouse's contact point.And another point to add- batteries. This mouse is NOT rechargeable, and it does NOT come with any included cables. For some this may be a deal breaker, but for me it's perfect. I don't mind rechargeable mice, but with 4K polling becoming the new \" standard \" I imagine constant charging could be a nuisance.However, there's a kit on here from PowerOwl that contains 8 aaa batteries and a charging system. I paid around $30 for the rechargeable lithiums and the aaa to aa converters in total. The converters came in a 10 pack so that was nice.This mouse is paired with my Hyperpolling dongle which can be purchased separately, or bundled together with this mouse when purchased from Razer.This. Thing. Is. Insane.When it comes to tracking accuracy I have absolutely nothing bad to say. The Focus Pro 30K in this mouse is the same sensor found in their flagships. Kudos to Razer for implementing that into their Hyperspeed line, which is widely recognized as their budget tier lineup.A few grievances of mine are that M2 ( right mouse click ) is considerably light. It might just be a case of heavy finger, but I found myself accidentally actuating the click at times.The side buttons are different in the fact that they are separated and have a bit of space between them. This is a good change, but I utilize M5 ( front side button ) as a Hypershift key, and it makes it a bit more difficult to hit M4 due to that split in distance. If you don't use Hypershift, then this should be of no concern.My copy has no creaking on the shell, no severe rattle, and the clicks are very crisp. I attribute that to the Gen 2 mechanical switches Razer are using in this mouse.For $70 you can't beat this, in my opinion! You're getting an insane amount of performance for a reasonable price. Pair this with a 4K polling dongle, grab some lithium rechargeable batteries, a few converters and you'll be fragging without the worry of cable drag in no time!Final score: 4.5/5Amazing job, Razer!",

The hero and the X were kinda heavy and bulky but I kind of like a bulky mouse despite how small my hands are. I tend to aim more with the wrist and I like how smooth it feels to aim with this mouse. The only problem I have is using AA batteries for the mouse.Pros: it\u2019s a mouse that works, good for MY hand position, standard drift in OSU from what I\u2019ve noticed, really smooth feeling when playing apex etc.Cons: consistent use of AA batteries (doesn\u2019t burn a hole in the wallet but still tedious).The position of the sensor may cause a lower sensitivity (not really game breaking but I had to because it felt way too quick compared to other mice I\u2019ve had).",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First of all keep in mind this mouse just came out so I haven't had enough time to see if I run into any issues.With that said here's the review - The V3 Hyperspeed is a new shape compared to the old Vipers. It's now flatter on the sides and has a higher hump. These changes are exactly what I wanted to see and for me the shape is absolutely perfect for claw grip! It packs the same Focus Pro 30K sensor and tracks absolutely flawlessly. The switches are gen 2 mechanical switches and honestly Ive always preferred the feel of these over their optical switches. Scroll wheel and side buttons are some of the best as well as the tactility and feel is on point. Rest of the mouse feels great as well with no QC issues on my unit. This mouse uses either AA or AAA batteries (with adapter) so you can get the weight from anywhere between 68-82g the battery life depends on what polling rate you use. With the 4K dongle (sold separately) expect the battery life to be much less. Overall for $70 this mouse is a awesome value and so far from my testing I can definitely recommend it!",

Razer mice always feel a bit nicer in my opinion. Not sure what it is...clicky and smoothness in my brain. I have Razer Basilisk Ultimate, Razer Orochi, and Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed before this one...And this one delivers an amazing experience as well. I honestly enjoy all four of them. Basilisk X has the worst quality build and it is not in the same category as the other 3 mice. Viper V3 Hyperspeed shape and smoothness is amazing. It offers a different feels to Basilisk Ulitmate and Orochi. All 3 of them are amazing in its own, but it is even better when you like to switch between mice once in a while. Functionally wise all of them are comparable. Viper V3 does not have a Bluetooth and it is the biggest negative. Viper V3 has amazing ergonomics for right (and left handed if needed). Lightweight as expected and glides like it is on ice. I love it",

The sensor performance is as you'd expect given the specifications of the mouse. Having 4k available is nice. The product isn't completely perfect though: the wheel can be rough on your finger at first, and the sensor placement is forward on the mouse. You'll need some time to adjust to that, and maybe need to adjust your sensitivity. As for shape, it's a taller mouse with a more rearward hump than the viper, and not quite as big as the GPX in fingertip grip (but similar; also similar to the s2 from Zowie). The shape is more angular than the GPX in claw - the mouse can feel big for some using this grip. Given that it clicks better and I prefer a mouse at around 70 grams and it fits my bigger hands better I'm using it over my v2 pro and GPX (I have two GPX).",
