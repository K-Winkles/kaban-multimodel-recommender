                "reviewText": "I LOVE this shade of red. As someone who values both aesthetics and functionality, this mouse is impressive. Red happens to be my favorite color, and this mouse's vibrant red hue adds a touch of personality and style to my desk. It's a refreshing departure from the usual black or gray. It injects a burst of energy into my workspace.Beyond its visual appeal, the ergonomic design of this mouse is brilliant. The vertical orientation aligns perfectly with the natural posture of my hand, reducing strain and discomfort during long hours of use. What surprised me most was how quickly my hand adapted to this new design. It felt comfortable and intuitive right from the start, making it a smooth transition from my previous mouse.The rechargeable feature is a fantastic addition. No more fussing around with disposable batteries. The included USB receiver is easy to set up, and the mouse charges quickly using the included cable. It's a convenient and eco-friendly choice, which I appreciate.The six buttons on this mouse are well-placed and responsive. The 800/1200/1600 DPI settings offer versatility, allowing me to tailor the cursor speed to my preference for different tasks, whether it's precise design work or swift navigation across multiple screens.",

                "reviewText": "Edit about seller cus. service: I noticed the jumping issue with scroll wheel. I do see from other reviews that this is semi common and the issue I had with the iClever mouse. I saw on their seller page that they offer 12 mos. quality guarantee. I contacted them and asked for same mouse exchange. They offered to replace. They responded within 1 hour- Great communication and thank you! If you're having any scroll wheel issue- contact them!This is my 2nd ergo mouse I'm trying. First one was from iClever. The same concept of ~60 degree tilt, handshake grip which is more neutral for wrist. iClever (uses AA battery) has nice feeling and shape, but for my medium female hands, it felt too big, and the thumb rest position was too far away which caused more back of hand tension. And the clicks weren't as responsive. This Vassink one has rechargeable battery, so it's much lighter and the footprint is smaller and narrower. So far (2-3 days) it feels more comfortable in my hand. It's hard to know if it'll relieve my typical forearm pain. Usually one sees that over longer periods. But the clicks are more responsive. iClever has definite issues with scroll button where it jumps around. So far I don't see this here, but it's still new to me. I think with these ergo mice, you have to try them out to see if the fit is right for your hand. * side note I got the red color. It's not as bright, which I prefer. It's more metallic matte red- super pretty and adds nice subtle style.",

                "reviewText": "I have used mostly your standard type of mouse. I have a rollerball mouse for my laptop which I love, but it isn\u2019t practical for work. I wanted to try something to help with wrist pain. The operation of this one is great. Smooth and quiet. My hand fit well around it, however it wasn\u2019t great for me. Based on all the good reviews, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just me, but my wrist actually hurt more with this one. I used it for a week and a half thinking I would just have to get used to it. I never did. Another issue is that picking up the mouse and repositioning on my mousepad was awkward and interrupted my flow. The last issue I had was I couldn\u2019t get used to the height of it and kept knocking it over, making it click on something I didn\u2019t want to click on.For me, it didn\u2019t work, but the product itself was great, so it gets 4 stars",

                "reviewText": "When I first started using it, I was a little bothered by the left and right click being so quiet. I'm used to a \"clicky\" sounding mouse. But after using this for over a week now, I love how quiet it is. Battery Life seems pretty good. I haven't had to charge it yet, so that's nice. It has been on for over a week. I'm not turning it off at night after I leave work either. Forward and back buttons are a must for me. The only downside I have found is the sensitivity selector at the top doesn't have as many options as I'd like. But that's not a big deal.It's light, comfy, and the material feels nice in the hand. I have the USB receiver going through a USB extention, into a splitter hub and plugged into my computer trhough a thunderbolt port and it works great. Might just get another one as a backup.",

                "reviewText": "The mouse had issues from the beginning now it's gotten much worse after a month of usage. The left click was unresponsive 2 out of 5 clicks, now it's more like 3 out of 5. The scroll wheel is barely functional. It has a mind of its own, scrolls all over the place if I scroll. Sometimes unresponsive. If feels as if its free scrolling without the clickiness. One scroll is enough to send a page all the way to the top or the bottom.I guess I got a damaged product, assumed it will get better after a week's usage, it didn't.The charge does not last as long as claimed but it is not at all disappointing. Same goes to Bluetooth range.Other than this, the build quality and the texture is good. Definitely improved my wrist pain. None of that matters because I can barely use the mouse anymore.",
