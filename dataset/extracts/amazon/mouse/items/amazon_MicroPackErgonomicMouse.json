The color shows as a mint color on Amazon but is really more of a sage color which was a very pleasant surprise, feels nice on my wrist, very quiet clicks. Easy to connect to iPad and computer just plug it in! Arrived on Saturday and I\u2019ve used it like crazy since then. Definitely worth trying! :)",

                "reviewText": "I've been using a kensington trackball for many years. I've been having some recent hand and wrist pain that settles in my thumb. My physical therapist suggested a vertical mouse, and I decided to order this since it looked comfortable and has great reviews and a great price. The optical sensor on this is better than any other I've tried. It works great so far on various surfaces, the sensor, buttons and travel are all working great right out of the box. The glide is very good too. The next test will be to see how long this lasts. At this price I'm really blown away by the quality of this.",

                "reviewText": "My logi mouse went crazy and needed a replacement, plus my hand hurt after long use, so I started looking for a vertical mouse. The Logi Lift is a natural candidate, but this cheaper alternative is quite intriguing, so I decided to give it a try before I buy the more expensive Logi. This one seems a keeper. Hand hold feel very comfortable.Initially, I feel my hand has to move a lot more to get the mouse move (for not so precise work), but after I adjusted the DPI setting, it seems more responsive now. Still feel more time to get used to, but no significant negative feeling. The click is very light and quiet, if that is what you looking for. I used it at home and somewhat prefer stronger click feedback. But again, I see he benefit of quiet operation as well.Don't know how long this will last. However, even the more expensive Logi will break eventually. So, my initial feeling of this product is very positive. Will update if things change.",

The mouse only works on laminate type surface, does not work on a desk surface or table top. The clicks are quite which is a huge pls but the main issue was the mouse left click does not seem to register the first 2/3 times and that the most needed part. Could be that it\u2019s defective, stuff like that does happen nothing is perfect. Scroll wheel works great! Really wished it work to its full potential. Will update with replacement",

It was a treasured item until the spinner stopped working less than a month in. It spins freely and the mouse pointer moves all over the place now. I need to buy a new mouse. I don't recommend this mouse for daily usage for gaming as it isn't built to hold up to excessive use obviously. Buyer Beware.",
