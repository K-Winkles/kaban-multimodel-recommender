                "reviewText": "The EVGA X20 Wireless Gaming Mouse is a solid option for gamers who are looking for a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse.Firstly, the design of the mouse is sleek and ergonomic, making it comfortable to hold for extended gaming sessions. The matte black finish gives it a premium look and feel. The mouse is also lightweight, which is great for quick and precise movements.The wireless performance of the X20 is impressive. It uses 2.4GHz wireless technology, which provides a strong and stable connection with low latency. The mouse has a range of up to 30 feet, allowing for freedom of movement without any lag. Additionally, the battery life is excellent, lasting up to 30 hours on a single charge.The X20 features a high-precision optical sensor with adjustable DPI settings, ranging from 800 to 15,000 DPI. This allows for smooth and accurate tracking, perfect for FPS, MOBA, and other gaming genres. The onboard memory also lets you save your preferred DPI settings, making it easy to switch between different sensitivities on the fly.Customization options are plentiful with the X20. It has 7 programmable buttons, including a DPI adjustment button and two side buttons. The EVGA Unleash software allows for extensive customization, including button mapping, macro recording, and RGB lighting customization. The RGB lighting is subtle but adds a nice touch to the overall aesthetics.One downside of the X20 is that it is only compatible with Windows operating systems. Mac and Linux users will not be able to fully utilize the mouse's software features. Additionally, the software can be a bit finicky at times, requiring occasional updates to resolve any bugs or issues.Overall, the EVGA X20 Wireless Gaming Mouse offers a great combination of performance, comfort, and customization options. It's a reliable wireless gaming mouse that won't break the bank.",

                "reviewText": "You will NEED to download the EVGA software that you'll use with you mouse and perform the recommended firmware update before using to maximize the life and performance of your mouse.Start off by saying EVGA has been a rock-solid name and brand in the gaming community for a very long time and I will admit that even though EVGA makes solid hardware that was in the GPU MOBO PSU areas of gaming. My personal experience with this brand might and probably will differ from yours and that's okay because this is based on a personal experience and a multi-year relationship gaming around EVGA. No more Video Cards but stellar mouse and keyboard(s). I'm going to share some of my thoughts and opinions on this device. Rather you agree or not well let's just say maybe we can help others decide on their purchase.ProsPricing at time of purchase ($19.00) USABluetooth/Wireless/WiredTriple Sensor System5 Profiles with customizable settingsLEDs with Customizable settingsSoftware to update your mouse and adjust settings Leds and such.Macro(s)I use Bluetooth on my PC and Wireless on my Xbox Series X (Separate playing of course but that's an option)Customizable sensor settings for mats and it has an option to set for gaming or office or basic use. It really works but I feel maybe it adjusts the DPI sensitivity automatically maybe don't know a guess.ConsBattery seems to die quicker than my other Bluetooth mouse(s)(Razor Logitech Steel Series)Cord gets in the way if plugged in to the keyboard usb and is too short to plug in PC (used for charging and wired option)The Sniper button sits too high and off set for me and i am a claw type of gamer. (big hand friendly)The weight seems a bit too light. I'm used to heavy, but you be the judge.ConclusionA well-rounded budget option for anybody wanting to use a Bluetooth and wireless mouse. (Time of purchase)I did charge the mouse completely before using and update the firmware and would recommend you do the same before you use it. make sure before your return window expires that your mouse is working in every aspect it has to offer. I have pushed this mouse hard from the start and it's amazing. Time will tell and ill update in the event of a failure or issue. Multiple clicks and farming sticks later we are still in the game baby. A thumbs up if i helped and for effort. Enjoy your EVGA purchase and welcome to EVGA family.",
