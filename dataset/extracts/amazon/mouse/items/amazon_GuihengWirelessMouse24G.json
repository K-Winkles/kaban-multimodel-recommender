As I stated in my video you really got to hold it in place if you intend to right click to copy and paste something or highlight wording because the moment that you go to right click on something, due to the share force that you have to press the button in order to get the mouse to function it's sometimes will move your cursor off of whatever it was that you were trying to highlight. Other than that though it's a good product. I bought it because I do online schooling. Also the clicking sound kind of gets a little annoying but for $5 what can you do? LOL",

After checking to make sure the wireless piece was installed on myLaptop I thought I put the batteries on wrong. After checking taking them out I noticed the spring on the one side for the batteries was messed up. Looks like it\u2019s broken and not mounted to inside of mouse correctly. I put in for a replacement with hopes it\u2019s made right. Other issue is batteries go in on top of each other and not side by side which to me is the better way - side by side.",
