It is a little big for my hand and sometime I can't get it to click because my index finger isn't long enough to click up by the scrool wheel and I have to adjust my \"grip\" so it will work. The other thing is, it is taller than a regular mouse and I find myself knocking it over when I move my right hand from the keyboard to the mouse. I am sure this will pass as I get more accustomed to it's hight. Response time is excellant. Comfortable to use and very natural grip. Hoping it helps with my carpel tunnel.",

It took me over 12 years to finally destroy it.That said, I bought this mouse because I needed something with the side back/forward controls and the ergonomics looked good on it. Problem is, there was no way to tell how big or small it was from the photo.Well, I can tell you this... I have man hands, bear paws, and this thing fits like a GLOVE!It doesn't have a super high \"hump\" that raising your palm, my thumb hits the side buttons perfect and it is stable and accurate when firing on the battlefield.Oh, and the drivers... NOT necessary... worked right out of the box, HOWEVER, I recommend the drivers as they let you customize the color scheme, button assignment and DPI per click on the 7 way dpi setting. The driver file is SMALL, not bloatware (like Logitech G for headphones at a whopping 150mb, this was only like 6mb?) and it did exactly what it said it would, immediately.For what I paid, I GOT MORE than what I paid for and VERY, VERY pleased!",

The mouse texture itself is great for gripping and cleaning as well.I have not had any discomfort using this mouse. It's my favorite laptop accessory now and I get asked about it often. Def worth it for preventative measures and if you have existing hand issues from computer work.",

And it has been very reliable.One feature to be aware of is that it takes a very long time to charge (hours) even on a fast charger. Fortunately it is rare that it needs a charge, even with all day use. Suggestion: keep a spare around for those rare occasions.Identifies as Newmen Tech.,LTD 2.4G Wireless Mouse, but not found on the Newmen website.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Amazon review since I became a member more than 10 years ago, meaning that this mouse is so bad, detrimental to health to the extent that I am compelled to report and let others know about the danger of using this product. I bought this mouse because I have small hands and someone recommended it stating it's a perfect fit to her small hand. So, I bought it on May 1, this year.First off, this mouse is pretty heavy, so burdens my hand when I move it around. Speaking of its design, it's pretty bulky and poorly made, so when you use fingers (thumb, index and the middle finger), you really need to apply pressure on your fingers. I didn't feel comfortable when I started to use it, but continue to use it to my regret. In one month, I had developed severe inflammation on my thumb, with my bone sticking out as well as minor inflammation on index and middle fingers.Now that Amazon return period is over, I have to throw it out. Wasting money is one thing, but developing three arthritic fingers really piss me off. I did not return it right away as I returned one mouse just before I bought this one. That's why I pushed myself to use it. I've been using various mouses for almost 3 decades, and this is the worst, ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EVER mouse. So, others beware!",

                "reviewTitle": "Revised - drops connection after 3 months",
                "reviewText": "Below the Asterisks is my original review. Comfort wise the mouse is good. However, you can't earn more than a star if the item refuses to stay connected after 2 months.Curiously, I looked at some of the other reviews where they have the same connectivity issues as I am having, and they all look to occur within a few weeks of the Amazon return window (about 2 to 3 months).I really like the design of the mouse, and the tactile feel, so I would be willing to try a replacement and hope they just have some duds in their batches. Still trying to figure out how to contact them for a replacement.The issue is that the mouse stops working after less than a minute of activity. Turn off, turn on, working for less than a minute again. I thought it might be driver issues so tried it on both windows 7 and windows 10. Both are exhibiting the identical connectivity problems. Looks like I have a new $50 paperweight.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************So, overall I would give 3.5 stars, not 4 out of 5. But I errored towards higher since it's hand size dependent.After less than a week of use. I suspect it would be very comfortable for those with small, or medium-small hands. But it is still a full sized mouse. Not a laptop or reduced form factor mouse.THE GOODRUBBERIZED: The finish quality is excellent. The rubberized finish should be on all mouses to allow the hand to rest comfortably and not require extra flexing to keep hand from sliding. Especially on vertical mouses. This one has a nice silky rubberized finish on the thumb and the buttons. Not gross rubbery like some. For those concerned about this finish becoming sticky, regular (every 3 to 6 months?) treatment with Talcum or baby powder keeps this finish from deteriorating. This goes for all mouses and tools like yard tools with rubberized handles. In some cases, it can even restore a finish that's started to get sticky.BACK/FORWARD THUMB CLICK BUTTONS: Very nicely placed, a nice ridge that gives your thumb a good sense of the button, and a nice feel to the click. Silent.CLICKING (right / left click buttons): Nice feel, and nice firmness to avoid accidental clicks which frequently happens to me with vertical mouses. Hope it lasts. Also, very quiet. Near silent.SCROLL WHEEL: Adequate. Default speed is good. Maybe a little loose. Could use a more clicky feel to the roll, but that's just preference. It's not free rolling which is good. But I do have a slight suspicion this might be a mechanical component that won't last.ERGONOMICS (small hands): I suspect this would be extremely comfortable for smaller hands. I have short, but wider medium hands. Male.USB-C cable included: time for companies to start including this. micro-USB is disappearing. And plugging in USB-C is much smoother due to no up or down direction.THE MEDIOCREERGONOMICS (medium hands): It's not bad. A bit larger, and slightly more palm support and it would be perfect. Almost wide enough (could use about 10mm to 15mm more width on the pinky side where it starts to jut out horizontally). Still, the contour on that little pinky plate is very nice. Just needed to jut out to the right a bit more to support the pinky side of the hand fully. For length, just a little on the short side by approx. 1 inch (25mm). All these vertical mouses should have palm support for stability and downward pressure, but few do. This mouse is not exception. A bit small for my medium sized hand (see photos). And I would like even more doming on the pointer 1st click button so that finger rested on the button more. This would allow for a more vertical feel to this button without having to make the whole mouse aggressively vertical like some. But doming is still better than most in this department. At least it doesn't slope aggressively to the desk like most logitech mouses. Could be slightly more vertical, but I would prefer more doming on the left click instead (see photo of space below my finger and left click).DPI BUTTON: A button I never use. But it never lets me forget it's there. Very high, and can always feel it when using the scroll wheel. And no indication of the current DPI settings for those who do use it.DRIVERS?: Are there even any available to allow customization? Nothing in the manual or the cheep OEM box it shipped in.NO BLUETOOTH: but that's expected at this price point. Not a true negative, just informing people that it's not included. 10 dollars more and it should be included.THE BADSLEEP MODE: It's confusing at first, and almost made me return the mouse. I had to read the fine print on the instructions to realize the issue. Most mice will wake up with movement. This one requires a click to wake. So good to have sleep for battery life, but I almost returned the mouse thinking it was defective. Either add movement wake, or a clear logo on the top of the mouse stating: \"click to wake\". If this had been clear, I would have listed this as mediocre, not bad. Don't expect people to read instructions for basic mouse functionality. Most will only read them to get more in-depth feature instructions. We're all to use to mouse operation now. No one reads the instructions on a pen package. Almost wasted my time returning the mouse. But will keep now, unless something else crops up.All in all, for the price, a very good mouse. You would be pressed to find a decent flat mouse at this price. But well priced. Competitors are over priced and silly margins.A note about my photos: I didn't take fresh photos with the rulers since photos with scale can be deceptive due to perspective. I included photos that show other mouses with proper ruler scales and guides to eliminate perspective confusion, and then added the Tecknet mouse to a photo side by side with those other mouses to give a sense of its true size. I think this will give a better sense than a photo with a ruler alone. I don't have time today to do a proper scale setting with all the paper strips which help avoid perspective problems in photos with rulers. The paper strips in the old photos without the tecknet mouse are lined up exactly with the body of the mouse at it's most extreme length or width (not including the thumb rest on the unimouse contour mouse - far left). The perspectives in the photos are a bit deceptive since it looks like the mouse edges go past the paper strips. They do not. The place the paper meets the ruler/tape measure is the true edge of the mouse.",

Sin embargo, es importante destacar que, si vienes de usar otro tipo de ratones, puede llevar un poco tiempo acostumbrarse a esta nueva ergonom\u00eda. Los botones de avance y retroceso, ubicados en el lateral so los que me han costado m\u00e1s para utilizarlos.En resumen, el Rat\u00f3n Vertical Inal\u00e1mbrico TECKNET 2.4G es una opci\u00f3n excelente para quienes buscan un rat\u00f3n ergon\u00f3mico de alta calidad. Con materiales duraderos, botones r\u00e1pidos y silenciosos, dise\u00f1o atractivo, duraci\u00f3n de pilas, indicadores luminosos y configuraci\u00f3n de DPI personalizable, este rat\u00f3n tiene mucho que ofrecer.Encontrar\u00e1s con un compa\u00f1ero de trabajo o juego que cuidar\u00e1 de tu comodidad y salud a largo plazo.Lo recomiendo sin dudarlo.",
