Affiliate link to both products:The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro: https://amzn.to/3QI67tsAnker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad): https://amzn.to/46WLdMZThe Razer Basilisk V3 Pro https://amzn.to/3QI67ts is an extraordinary technological marvel that has greatly elevated my gaming sessions. This isn't just a wireless gaming mouse, it's a revolutionary device that blends comfort, precision, and personalization.Its ergonomic design was the first thing that drew me in. The mouse nestles perfectly in my hand, providing comfort during extended gaming marathons. While the design is primarily tailored for larger hands, I found it quite comfortable even with my average-sized hands.The HyperScroll Tilt Wheel and 11 programmable buttons are the standout features. The tilt wheel's dual-mode allows for a switch between tactile and free-spin scrolling, offering a versatile user experience. The programmable buttons let me tailor my gaming preferences, boosting my speed and efficiency.The Focus Pro 30K Sensor and Fast Optical Switches Gen-3 are the crowning features of this mouse. The upgraded sensor and switches deliver an impressively low click latency, leading to a highly responsive gaming experience. The sensor's performance is top-notch, making it an ideal choice for FPS gaming.The Chroma RGB lighting lends a visual charm to the mouse, transforming it from a mere device to an integral part of my gaming setup's character.However, the Basilisk V3 Pro does come with a substantial price tag. The wireless charging dock and HyperPolling dongle are sold separately, which adds to the overall cost. Despite the steep price, I believe the features and performance make it a worthwhile investment.In conclusion, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-end gaming mouse that offers a mix of comfort, customization, and superior performance. It's a valuable investment for any serious gamer seeking to enhance their gaming experience.Additionally, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is compatible with the Anker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad) https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ which offers 10W Max Fast Charging. If you\u2019re exploring wireless charging solutions, the Razer Wireless Charging Puck for the Basilisk V3 Pro Gaming Mouse is worth considering.Affiliate link to both products:The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro: https://amzn.to/3QI67tsAnker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad): https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ",

                "reviewText": "I am really enjoying this mouse. Is it my favorite mouse? Hard to say, I have different mice for different things. I have a Naga Pro for MOBAs and MMOs, a Deathadder v2 Pro for FPS, and an Orochi for my gaming laptop. I also have a drawer full of other mice that I enjoy using from time to time like the Roccat Burst Pro that was my daily driver for nearly a year.So where does this mouse fit in? To me, this is the best all-rounder. The hyperscroll is great for getting through long webpages or spreadsheets. Combined with its comfortable ergonomic shape, and low noise and pleasant feel, it is excellent as an office mouse.However, it is great for FPS games as well. The main buttons feel nice to click. The side buttons are easy to find and press. And I have even found myself using the clutch every now and then when sniping. And I have come to appreciate the thumb rest. No more accidently dragging the edge of my thumb on the mousepad.The features do add some extra weight, however. This in turn makes it slightly less desirable than my Deathadder for shooters. But really not by much. I only notice the weight difference if I am quickly switching between them. In use though, I do just as well with the Basilisk as I do with the Deathadder. Both are comfy for long game sessions. with excellent ergonomics and good buttons. I do enjoy the scroll wheel on the Basilisk more than the Deathadder.I could probably press the Basilisk into service for a MOBA. However, I have grown accustomed to the Naga's six button side panel. Since I have the option, I would probably be included to use that LoL or HotS (not that I play either much anymore).For MMOs there is nothing that can replace my Naga with the 12 button side panel. The Basilisk just cannot compete, and that's ok. MMO mice a very specialized thing. If you are at the point where you need 24+ keybinds on your mouse, you probably already have this covered.But, if you need just one mouse in your life, I think the Basilisk is an excellent choice. Even if you are shopping office mice, give this one a look. The Smart-Reel Hyperscroll is a thing of beauty for the office once you get used to it. And when you are gaming, the sensitivity clutch can be really handy.Also, the lighting looks pretty cool and it's easy to work with. Aesthetics are important too :D",

For context, its almost as good as one of the heavier logitech MX Master scroll wheels.- Weight: Its not a light mouse, but its perfect for me- Glide: Super smooth ptfe skates- Buttons: buttons are great. They sound good, and feel good. They are optical switches, so you dont need to worry about mis-clicksSoftware- response: its super responsive. no noticeable delay like (like with mx master mice)- Synapse: its still a little buggy, but the convenience if auto-switching profiles is too good.",

It feels spectacular in the hand. Yes, it's not ultra light like the Deathaddar, but weight of the mouse does not matter too much to me.The RGB is insane, super glowy, and looks fantastic. Build quality is great, the white looks really nice. I've read some reviews regarding its wireless capabilities being glitchy, but I haven't had any issues with it so far. And i have multiple bluetooth devices connected to my PC at all times.The additional side button that's reprogrammable is also a great addition.Overall, loving it so far.",
