                "reviewText": "For me, I love this Verbatim mini travel travel mouse. The first thing I noticed when I received the mouse is that it is a very small mouse yet I did not find it too small. (I have smaller hands so find this mouse is very easy to hold and use). Because I highly suggest this mouse, below I share the reasons why I am so happy with this mouse:1) Smaller mouse - it is comfortable to hold (if you have small hands or this is a superb mouse for a child/student because it easy to fit into backpack and super reliable for children and students).2) Buttons (left and right) are solidly made and they work just as well as the BIGGER MOUSE types (maybe better).3) Smoothness of movement, scrolling, speed of mouse - This is a gentle type of mouse. For me, I found that when I use the mouse the pointer moves perfectly (no jumping around like some of the big mouse types).Scrolling this mouse - the wheel of this mouse moved up and down to scroll SMOOTHLY!Speed of mouse - When I clicked the mouse once or double click, it performed wonderfully (the speed and smoothness reminded me of an old MS Mouse that I had but in a much small size).4) Construction of this mouse - Don't let this small size fool you. For me, I compared this mouse SIDE BY SIDE with an older MS Mouse for construction and ease of clicking, double clicking etc and this mouse performed the same as my old MS Mouse (corded).**The pull out cord is THICKER and less likely to breakage than the other CHEAP Generics of retractable corded mouse types. So I tested the strength and pulled very hard on the cord and it still retracted well back into the mouse when I finished my use!5) No battery or batteries to buy EVER! For me, I do admit that I love wireless MOUSE, but they don't last as long as a corded mouse and the batteries must be changed every 3-8 months depending on which brand you choose).What I recommend to you: *If you a buying this for yourself and you have smaller hands, or if you are buying this mouse for a student or young child then this is the best retractable travel mouse to buy. This is a very high quality mouse, just smaller.If you are a person who has larger hands, (and you prefer a larger mouse) may I suggest the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3500. (This is a superb cordless mouse and for me, I get up to seven months on one AA battery with the MS 3500 mouse. And it includes a AA Battery (only one battery is needed for this mouse).",

                "reviewText": "This product is exactly what it needs to be. It's small, inexpensive, and so far works great both on several different surfaces I've tried. My favorite thing about this mouse is the sturdy clicks from the buttons. It gives the feeling of good build quality and is much nicer to work with than the cheapo Microsoft mouse I purchased several months ago.This mouse is truly portable, unlike other wireless mice designed for laptop use. The fact that this one is corded means one less device that requires recharging or replacement batteries and makes the mouse much lighter. Bonus: if you use it on a plane and turbulence or butterfingers causes it to fall off your tray table, you have a tether to grab it again, and don't have to go through contortions to pick it up at your feet!Stop agonizing... just buy it. But don't get green, because then it will look like mine.",

I really didn't want to travel with a full size mouse or one of those bulky wireless ones, so I was happy to have found this mini-mouse. It works perfectly and is easy to pack. The retractable cord is great, so you don't have to worry about tying up a cord or having it strung out all over the place in your bag.",

                "reviewText": "love it! i've used a tiny mini mouse for more than a decade and have had a bit of a saga the past 6 months trying to find a replacement that performs as well as the first one i fell in love with. this verbatim one is a bit bigger than what i prefer but it's acceptable at 2 3/4\" x 1 3/4\" x 1 1/14\" high. the click resistance is perfect for me...not too easy not too hard. scroll wheel has a good feel. the cable seems to be just a bit thicker than the 2-3 failed mice that immediately preceded this one and very importantly it appears the connection point between the cable and the front of the mouse is bigger and stronger than others. that connection breaking was the cause of the demise of the beloved mini mouse i used for years so that's reassuring. the only slight negative is that this mouse inexplicably does not glide across the mouse pad as smoothly as others. it's as if it has little rubber pads on the bottom but i don't think it does. i hope this one lasts for years! if you don't see an update here assume it's still going! oh...and the purple is cool. :)",
