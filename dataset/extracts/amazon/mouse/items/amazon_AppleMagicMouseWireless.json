Hardware or external, does everything the trackpad does save for opening launchpad, but needing a gesture for that is a bit superfluous in my opinion. You can effortlessly gesture between tabs, programs, scrolling - works on every surface as well. If you\u2019re having any issues without a mousepad you can simply adjust its settings - the thing is absolutely worth the price. And a far better option than the more expensive trackpad imo.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mouse. Apple puts form over function in the design, but then they make up for it. It's small and sleek and clicky with just the right amount of weight. The charger port is hidden on the bottom where you can't charge and use the mouse at the same time, but I got over it. It's a trade-off for a flatter mouse, and I charged this mouse fully a couple weeks ago and I'm still at 75%. That's another plus - the last cheap mouse I had went to sleep all the time, took too long to reconnect and would be surprise me by dying at the most in-opportune time. This one connects quickly and easily and reports its battery percentage. Instead of 4 tiny cheap rubber dots, this mouse glides smoothly on two thick rails.The winning feature is gestures. No scroll wheel, just swipes. 2 fingers swiped left or right will switch between full screen apps, and tapping lightly with 2 fingers brings up Mission Control showing all my windows.",

                "reviewText": "So, this is great for Macs obviously, but I prefer the feel of an LG G series mouse to this. What I like about the magic mouse is the quality and capabilities. The battery life is really good and you could probably go over a month between charges if you\u2019re using it every day. One inconvenience though is that you cannot charge this and use it at the same time, so be sure not to let it get too low.The capabilities of this mouse are really good. You have some gesture options you can select from as the surface is a touch surface. One feature I like is the \u201cright click\u201d setting where the mouse can sense and perform a right click response like you would on a standard mouse. The scroll and window switch gestures available are also convenient. The shape, weight, glide resistance, and cursor speed takes some getting used to depending on what you\u2019re preferences are, but overall great product.",
