                "reviewText": "I went on the hunt for one of the new fangled \"lightweight gaming mouse\"..mice..mouses whatever. I originally had a g502 which I liked for the extra buttons, but the thing is a brick. Still nice, but it's a brick. I've been playing Valorant lately and thought I might try out one of these lightweight mice. Tried a Pulsar X2 which was great, but it started double clicking within a month of use.So here we are. I went back to Logitech and the biggest drawback is that it's expensive. Yes. However, I do LOVE the weight, the ergonomics, and the battery life is pretty solid!Before I get into the things that everyone talks about, I'd like to say one of my deciding factors was oddly the software. Yes. Software for accessories is annoying, HOWEVER, one of the things I love is Logitech's \"dpi shift\" function. If you're unaware, it's the ability to click and hold a button to change the \"sensitivity\" of the mouse and when you let go it drops back down to the original sensitivity. Other mice use \"dpi cycle\" which isn't quite the same. I'd used some that actually cause frame rate drops when I use dpi cycle. So logitech was an easy choice for me.Otherwise, the battery life is nice! I use my mouse a LOT and I'd say I have to charge once every few days. You can use it while it's plugged in. I did opt in for a third party charging dock...although I still forget to put it on the dock sadly.Also I will say that at first, despite it being lighter, your hand will probably hurt a little bit if you're switching from a different mouse. I thought this was going to be a bad fit for me, but after a couple of days I got used to it and I don't notice a different in comfort levels now.All in all if you're looking for a reliable, lightweight, wireless, high performance mouse, this is definitely it. It's kind of the gold standard for a reason. I'd say the pricing is the biggest drawback, but rather than spending $60-100 on a mouse that falls a bit short or disappoints, it might be better to save up and go for this instead!",

                "reviewText": "I've had this mouse for a couple of weeks now after replacing my Razer Viper and it has been worth every penny since. I was initially upgrading from the viper since the grip was wearing and it began to squeak a little. The viper was by far my favorite shape in any mouse while having the best sounding switches to me, but I needed something to last me longer than what it had done for me. The ultimate version of the viper which happens to be wireless which is something that I've been wanting to try long term now is simply too low profile which makes it hard for me to grip with with a claw grip. Since this was the case I was shopping around and found the g pro x superlight which beats it in almost every spec which was lucky for me. This mouse is one of the lightest none honeycomb mice on the market and of every wireless mouse out there I believe that it is the lightest so it has a lot going for it on top of the usual top tier sensor that all expensive mice have. Another advantage that the g pro x has over the viper is that the scroll wheel is very smooth and easy to use while being noticeably stepped as to not accidentally scroll. Though there is one downside of which I don't really consider a knock against the g pro as it more praise for the viper as logitech typically has quite high pitched mouse clicks which are not too noticeable with headphones on. Once again that isn't so much a problem that logitech has so much as one of its characteristics that it shares with many mice all around and the one exception would be the razer viper (also the newer razer mice that have switched to their optical switches which sound much quieter and bassier by comparison).Adjusting was fairly easy for me since it suits claw grips quite well even if it felt a bit smaller than my viper and the fact that it is lighter even if by only 6 grams is very noticeable once you don't have a cable attached. Previously I had quite a nice bungee setup with my viper to accommodate an already very light weight, but it simply can't hold a candle to a super light mouse with NO cable at all. Performance is stellar as I have mentioned, beating my razer viper which I had previously considered to be the king of all gaming mice at the time, except for one minor hiccup that I had out of the box; Upon opening up the box and getting the mouse all set up immediately by plugging in the wireless dongle into the front of my PC, I noticed with my initial gaming/testing that it would be \"skipping\" around and simply not register at times. This was caused more than likely by tons of interference from a bluetooth transmitter for my tv, one from my PC for my controller and more miscellaneous wireless connections, but once I used the cable with the adapter to put the dongle right on my desk with clear line of sight, it has not had even one issue.Over the two weeks that I've had this mouse, I've only had to charge it once as I've noticed that it loses roughly 7% per day with a few hour gaming session and quite a bit of web browsing and general work on my computer throughout the day. It wakes up from \"sleep\" instantly so it's never unresponsive even though it has quite an aggressive sleep cycle where it goes to sleep after roughly 5 minutes of inactivity.So, if you're looking for a top tier gaming mouse that does it all with 0 compromises, this is definitely the mouse for you. Another bonus is that the mouse came with rubber grips if you need them which I found quite helpful with the razer viper, but due to the generally small figure of the g pro I don't find it necessary. It also surprisingly comes with extra skates which will wear out over time, so this is quite the thoughtful addition that will come in handy from my experience with quite a few other mice. Now for the most important part, is the value as it is quite pricey; I don't think that it's an amazing value considering there's top tier competitors around $30 from Logitech themselves to Razer to Steelseries and more in that ultra-budget range up to $80 or so where mice have almost identical performance on paper; Though you do have to take into account that this mouse is wireless and there's about one other mouse that can even compete with it because of that which is the Razer Viper Ultimate. The RVU is cheaper by a considerable amount especially once you factor in sales, so that note I'd recommend it purely for the fact that it would be the best mouse you could get at that price point, but the G Pro x is still not completely comparable. Of the Logitech mice that I've had over the years, the G403 and G602, they've both held up extremely well aside from the grip failing a bit on the G403 of which the G Pro does not have since it's an add-on and because of that I circle back to recommending this mouse since while I haven't had it for as long, I can say based off Logitech's track record, it'll last.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:-Very, very light.-Clickity, responsive, & reliable buttons.-Scroll wheel has right-on resistance and it's easy to modulate.-Ergonomic and comfortable.-Fantastic dpi range, up to 25,600!-Long battery life.-Logitech G Hub software is intuitively laid out and easy to use.-Has a stow-away compartment underneath for the USB-A receiver dongle._____*Neutral:-Very expensive for a mouse.-Have to open the G Hub app to change the DPI setting._____*Cons:-NoneAlthough I'm not a pro gamer but a moderate PC gamer, I still appreciate the Logitech G Pro X Superlight very much. Just like its name says, the mouse is super, super light and it felt like an empty and hollowed-out dummy unit for customer display when I first picked it up. It's the lightest mouse I've ever laid my hands on and it took me a little while to get used to its surreal lightness. That's not to say, however, that the mouse feels cheap. Due to Logitech's excellent design, the mouse cups underneath my hand like a second skin, feeling very ergonomic and comfortable.For the type of games I play, which are mostly FPS and third-person action RPGs, the number of buttons provided proved adequate and satisfactory. MMO players, on the other hand, might wish for more. The left and right-click buttons, as well as the two left-side buttons all worked just fine. The scroll wheel, which has good resistance, performed well, with no over-, under- or laggy scrolling. It's tuned perfectly out-of-the-box and I have no complaints.I'm already familiar with Logitech's G Hub software and I'm glad the company is keeping the design and navigation within it simple and elegant. There aren't many customization options for the G Pro X Superlight because it comes with a minimal number of buttons (five) and no LED light colors to change, which is fine by me. But it's in here that you can toggle among the various DPI settings. Thanks to the awesome HERO sensor, the dpi can be set as high as 25K! My reflexes aren't that good so I usually have it set way lower when playing slower-paced third-party action RPGs and I crank it up a bit for FPS games like Cyperpunk 2077. You'll have to play around with the dpi slider until you find the setting that is most comfortable and appropriate for your usage scenario.It's only when I'm not gaming and using the mouse for web browsing and productivity tasks that I wish there was at least one or two more programmable buttons - a dpi-changing button and a general-purpose button underneath the scroll wheel. On my other computer mice with more buttons, I usually set the button underneath the scroll wheel to launch a keyboard shortcut, such as CTRL + W (close tab). If I had a dedicated dpi-changing button, then I could be saving some time by not having to launch G Hub and setting a different dpi value. But all of this is really nitpicking and missing the point since the G Pro X Superlight is specifically tailored for hardcore and pro-level gamers.All in all, I'm more than pleased with the Superlight. It is feather-light, very ergonomic and perfectly suited for hours-long gaming sessions, ultra-precise and accurate, and has really long battery life. The price tag is quite high but I can definitely see this mouse being worth it for both serious and casual gamers alike. It's an absolute 5-star win!",

                "reviewText": "The Logitech G Pro Superlight is a gaming mouse that lives up to its name, delivering a superlative gaming experience that has left me genuinely impressed. From its featherlight design to its precision performance, this mouse has elevated my gameplay to new heights.First and foremost, the weight of the G Pro Superlight is a game-changer. It's astonishingly light, making it feel like an extension of my hand rather than a peripheral. The absence of unnecessary bulk allows for lightning-fast movements, whether I'm engaging in rapid flick shots or executing precise maneuvers in a strategy game. Logitech has truly redefined what it means to have a lightweight gaming mouse.The design is not just about weight \u2013 it's also about comfort. The ambidextrous shape accommodates various grip styles, and the smooth curves provide a natural feel during prolonged gaming sessions. The mouse glides effortlessly on any surface, thanks to Logitech's Hero sensor, which delivers impeccable accuracy and responsiveness. I've experienced no lag, stutter, or jitter during intense gaming, giving me the confidence that my every move translates seamlessly in-game.The customizable buttons are strategically placed, allowing for quick access to essential commands without any accidental clicks. The minimalistic design doesn't compromise on functionality, and the lack of excess buttons adds to the overall clean aesthetic.The battery life is exceptional, lasting through extended gaming marathons without needing frequent recharging. The Powerplay compatibility is a notable feature, enabling wireless charging while in use. It's a small detail that adds a layer of convenience for those who prefer a wireless setup.Logitech has also nailed the build quality. The Superlight feels sturdy and durable, capable of withstanding the rigors of competitive gaming. The PTFE feet contribute to the smooth glide, ensuring that the mouse remains responsive and precise even under heavy use.",

                "reviewText": "As mentioned in the headline, I'm back to basics with this mouse. It's super light, it's white, it's wireless. It doesn't weigh a lot compared to my old Corsair Glaive. At 60g, the mouse is speedy and responsive\u2014excellent tactile feedback with the buttons and scroll wheel. The plastic body has zero rubber side grips, which my Glaive has; after two years of wear, holding the Glaive felt gross and sticky with the rubber sides. However, the Superlight 2 does come with non-slip tape/stickers if you need extra grip.I probably could have gone with a flashier, cheaper, all-plastic mouse, but at the end of the day, the features of this mouse outweigh any of the other alternative mice I was looking at.On-board memory for profile switching between my laptop and desktop, weight is ultra-light. The Glorious Model O comes in at 59g (wired/RGB/black), but I wasn't into the RGB lighting and the Cooler Master MM710 at 52g (wired/black). It's ultra-lightweight, white, wireless and has no RGB; the Superlight 2 quickly met all my requirements.A downside to this mouse is the lack of ambidexterity, as there are no right-side buttons, a super long charging cable, and a missing dedicated DPI button. Switching DPI is through the G Hub software.It's pricey, but I can see this mouse lasting me a long time. Worth the investment, in my opinion.",
