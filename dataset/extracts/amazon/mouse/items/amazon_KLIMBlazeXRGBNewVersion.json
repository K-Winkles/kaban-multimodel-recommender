How does the charging dock work? Connect the dock to your computer using the provided cable and then insert the USB receiver to the dock's frontal port (or directly to your computer if you prefer). To charge the mouse, simply place it on the dock until it snaps into position. Can the RGB / buttons be customized? Yes, you can download a customization software in our website (Windows only) to rebind the buttons, change the mouse settings, customize the RGB colors and effects, and set up useful macros. The mouse switches off automatically, is that normal? Yes, the mouse enters sleep mode after a short period of inactivity to save battery. To reactivate it, simply press any button. Can it be used while charging? Yes, just unplug the cable from the back port of the dock and connect it directly to your mouse to continue working or playing in wired mode.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that I've never written any review anywhere near this detailed for any product. Anyway,When I purchased this mouse for use at my job, I got it because it had great reviews, subtle RGB, a mostly normal-looking overall design, wireless connectivity, and no normal batteries. I did not expect a particularly high build quality, any sort of decent packaging, or really anything that was above any old standard mouse, I just really wanted a wireless RGB mouse that wasn't designed with the most ridiculous overly angular design.What I got was so much more. Immediately upon seeing the box, I'm noticing the high-quality cardboard construction, the velcro open and close tab, the custom-fit foam for every piece, the extensive and perfectly English (as well as several other languages) user's manual, and.... well, there's an envelope inside that I won't spoil, because the WOW factor on it was just nothing I've ever experienced with any other product. Hint: this mouse was created by a dedicated and closely-knit team who cares about what they do.But then it's time for the mouse. I plug in the USB receiver into the PC, switch on the mouse, and... it just works. It works perfectly. All the RGB lights come on with a perfectly fluid RGB change, the mouse sits well in your hand, it's light, the scroll wheel is HEAVENLY and notchy (better than my G502 ever will be), the clicking feels firm and everything is just so well put together. It easily magnetizes to the wireless dock, which I hadn't even previously realized came with RGB on it. The mouse's lights change to green to indicate that it's charging, and change back to RGB once charged adequately. I was so excited at work that I attracted the attention of a coworker who immediately noticed the mouse, read the contents of the envelope, and, no joke, bought the mouse IMMEDIATELY. There was no hesitation and he was just as blown away as I was at the sheer quality of the mouse.Mice that are priced at one hundred dollars more have little going for them above this mouse, besides maybe a years-proven reliability and maybe a couple extra buttons I've never even used. But for a vast majority of purposes, this mouse is going to be the best buy you can get, really. It's just so affordable and amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if the mouse rises in price as more and more orders come in, but it's worth it. At this point I should just work for their marketing team because I've spent more effort selling this mouse to strangers than I do anywhere else. Thank you KLIM",

                "reviewText": "Got the mouse\u2014fantastic packaging by the way\u2014 and one of the first things I do is put on the grip stickers and the what I assume to be \u201csmoother\u201d surface stickers for the bottom. The grip stickers are very very nice, but I noticed some functionality issues where the mouse would suddenly just stop moving for a short period of time. I thought I was going crazy. Was it the battery? Was it the driver?No, turns out the sensor on the bottom of the mouse has a VERY short range (good for gaming! No accidental movement other than when the mouse is on the pad) but it\u2019s in fact SO short that just adding the small risers for smoother motion sometimes caused the mouse to not register some movements. Took off the stickers, and the mouse worked like a charm.Other notes: clicking is very very satisfying, build quality is excellent for the price, the subtle RGB is super clean and I dig it a lot, and the charging holder holds the mouse well.Excellent product, but the stickers for the bottom of the mouse seem like a bit of a mechanical oversight, as they detract from the functionality of the mouse. Why include them?",
