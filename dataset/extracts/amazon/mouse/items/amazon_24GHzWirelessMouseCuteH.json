                "reviewText": "This mouse did the job for almost two years, purchased in October 13th, 2020, and death August 29th, 2022.Pros:-For me personally, this mouse fit perfectly in my hand. *****However, my hands are really small, so this might pose a problem for others.******-Battery life was great. I only needed to replace the batteries probably three times at most in the time it lived.-Very adorable. Got many compliments on it.-Clicks very quietly. Never anything that bothered me.-No connection issues, pointing and clicking never failed.Cons:-Mine had a really bright red light that I could see through the body of the mouse. This didn't affect its practicality, just a visual thing that it might have been better without.-Randomly, probably only a month into ownership, the scroll button stopped working properly. Using it would cause jittery scrolling that did not align with my actual scrolling. However, I just used my trackpad after this happened (I am on a laptop) to scroll, and the mouse for pointing and clicking. For those who are using this for a PC, I would recommend a different mouse to ensure that you wont have that problem.Overall, solid mouse, great price, very cute. Recommend for those with small hands on laptops.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If this were just about looks I would absolutely give this mouse a 5/5. It is soooo adorable and I love it. That said, it does come with some weird quirks so I can't bring myself to give it five stars. Let's at least start with the good. Again. It. Is. ADORABLE! The silicone it is made from is soft and the size fits well in my hands. If you have larger hands, it may be too small for you. My favorite feature is that after several minutes of non use it automatically turns off to save your battery.Now, for the bad. First and foremost the construction of this mouse isn't the best. Again the silicone is nice but the mouse feels lightweight and a little cheap. There was also a giant split in the face, where the silicone meets the plastic, of mine which I was a little bummed about. You can see it in the pictures above. As far as usability of the mouse, it works ok. Downward scrolling is an issue. It has a really hard time scrolling downwards and will jump up for no reason. I've attached a video that hopefully portays that. If you need scrolling for work/gaming. This may not be the mouse for you.Over all, I'm happy with the mouse. It has some quirks and issues but it's still usable. I wouldn't suggest it for gaming, but for regular computer use its fine. I would say that the price is a little expensive for this mouse. I wouldn't mind so much if mine came without the huge crack in the seam on the face. Maybe this company needs better quality controll.",
