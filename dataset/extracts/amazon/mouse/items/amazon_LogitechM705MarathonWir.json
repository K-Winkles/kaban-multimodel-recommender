Its ability to effortlessly connect with multiple devices is nothing short of impressive.This mouse allows me to switch between three devices with ease, thanks to its Bluetooth capability and USB Unifying Receiver. It's incredibly convenient for my setup where I constantly toggle between a laptop, desktop, and tablet.With a 1000 DPI sensor, the M720 provides precise tracking on almost any surface. This precision is a big plus for tasks that require detail-oriented control. Additionally, the eight programmable buttons are a boon for productivity, allowing me to customize shortcuts and commands.Ergonomically, the M720 is a winner. It fits comfortably in my hand, making it easy to use for extended periods without any discomfort. Battery life is another area where this mouse excels, lasting months on a single AA battery, which is quite economical and efficient.In summary, the Logitech M720 Triathlon is an exceptional wireless mouse, especially for those managing multiple devices. Its seamless connectivity, high precision, customizable buttons, and ergonomic design make it a top-tier choice for both work",

                "reviewText": "It took me a while to find a Bluetooth mouse that was comfortable and had all the features I wanted, and the M720 finally checked those boxes. I use this on three different devices, and switching between them is easy and works great. To me the mouse is very comfortable in the hand, lightweight enough for lots of use, and the buttons and scroll wheel are nicely placed. The fact that the device switching button is right next to the back and forward buttons, but it's easy enough to get used to. The option to switch the scrolling mode is nice, but I rarely turn it to fast mode. My one issue really is that the mouse clicks are rather \"clicky\" compared to more silent options. Not a deal breaker, but I wish Logitech would bring their quiet click to this mouse.The only other thing of note is that I first purchased this mouse in spring 2023 and it is all black, but the second one I purchased later is more of a dark charcoal, and white on the bottom. I don't mind, just find it odd that the colors changed.All-in-all, a great multi-device mouse that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",

                "reviewText": "Lately I have tried several wireless mice. I have a large hand and prefer a larger, heavier mouse. Larger ones are not as easy to find. I tried a couple of generic brands. While full featured electronically, their mechanical assembly was cheap, the buttons were flimsy, and the scrolling was not consistent. They did not last long. This Logitech M720 impressed me a lot. It is solid and well built. It is comfortable with my large hand. It is not a \"travel mouse\" meaning that would be a bit bulky to carry around with a laptop. I would not call it a large mouse either. Perhaps its size is medium but it seems perfect for me. It is nice and heavy, almost 5 ounces, which gives you more control when you need precise movements. Other reviewers suggest this mouse is suitable for hands of all sizes. The buttons are quiet. The scroll wheel has a slight click from the detents. It supports Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz wireless. The USB receiver is stored under the battery cover. The AA battery is supposed to last 2 years. You can find a program on the Logitech web site to help pair the mouse with your computer and another program to help you set mouse options. The users guide is there too. I may buy another one of these just to keep on hand for some future need.",

                "reviewText": "I own a number of Logitech mice, and have been buying them for many years, going back to the early 1990s. They've always been the best quality and design. I really do like this mouse, but it's not without a few issues.For one, the scroll wheel is too loose feeling, and not of the same quality as previous left/right/middle button scroll wheels on the other Logitech mice I've owned. The build quality of this feature really does need to be improved even if it means raising the price 20 bucks. The other issue is the forward/backward buttons on the side are too close to the device switcher button. This is a major design oversight, and what happens during usage is you'll accidently hit the switcher button, and deactivate the mouse! This is a button that should (and is on some models) be on the bottom of the mouse! This issue also kind of breaks the usability of the mouse for someone who doesn't understand it. They press the device switch, and the mouse just stops working. For someone like my mom with mild cognitive impairments, this is a deal breaker. This device switch can't be deactivated either. Logitech designers, please do put buttons like this near frequently used controls. Really, I don't understand how this feature got through design review. If design reviews are challenging to your company, please contact me, and I'll review it for free.The other issue isn't really with the mouse itself, it's the Logitech Options software on MacOS (Ventura). I have a 2017 MacBook Pro with the latest software. The Logitech Options mouse software frequently unloads or crashes after taking the laptop out of standby and has to be restarted. Even when it is running, it will lose the customer settings, scroll wheel settings, and mouse sensitivity settings. It's bad, and requires constant restarting or coaxing. Being software, I do hope Logitech fixes these bugs, but as of today, the software is junk and makes the mouse a pain to use, but is not a deal breaker. I use it anyway, and just deal with the software issues.The mouse itself works well in bluetooth mode, (even on an Apple) is fairly comfortable, and has decent ergonomics. I would prefer a larger mouse because my hands are large, but I guess that's my problem. Other than the wheel, the workmanship is good and I expect this mouse to last at least 3 years..For the price, you really can't beat it. The left/right scroll on the scroll wheel is the best feature at this price point even if the wheel is loose. With all it's issues this device is still so much better than those cheap commodity mice. For the price, I'd recommend it. Just be warned, it's not going to be easy to use on a Mac, and the device switching button is going to get hit now and then deactivating the mouse.",

                "reviewTitle": "The BEST wireless mouse for work and home uses",
                "reviewText": "First let me tell you my experiences with wireless computer mice before discussing the pros and cons. I am very picky about mice, and trust me I have used a lot of mice - not only from Logitech but also from other brands - over the years. Even from Logitech alone, I have used several of their models - from the bottom tier to the top tier. But no other mouse has ever given the satisfaction that this one is giving. It is, hands down, the best wireless mouse for office and home uses imo. Now, let's discuss the pros and cons.PROS: In a nutshell, this mouse has everything you can ask from a office and home purpose mouse. Nevertheless, I would like to point out some major advantages:1. Well built with quality materials, sturdy and good looking.2. Ergonomic design that fits average size hands perfectly.3. Scroll wheel is the best I have used. It does both horizontal and vertical scrolling. Also, you can switch between 'line-by-line scrolling' and 'super fast scrolling' just through a tap of the button over the scroll wheel. This method provides far more accurate and consistent scrolling than what I have experienced with Logitech MX Master 3S, although this model cost me one-third of the Master 3S's.4. Multiple programmable button that you can customize through the Logitech Option+ software.5. There is a gesture feature also! You can tap and perform several commands using different gestures. The commands are customizable through the software. This feature helps me immensely.6. Charging indicator light is very handy.7. Connect up to 3 devices using the dongle and two different Bluetooth bandwidth. Each one has an indicator number that lights up according to which connection is active (how cute is that!). You can switch smoothly between multiple devices.8. The battery backup is extraordinary.9. There is an on/off button at the back of the mouse. You can turn it off in case you decide to not using it for a long time.Now let's discuss the cons. Well, these are not cons for me personally but I guess some people might find them uncomfortable.1. This mouse is not well-suited for gaming. It doesn't have that much high DPI that a gaming mouse needs. This is not a con of this model since it is not intended for gaming. Just a caution.2. Some people might find the clicking sound a little louder, though I am totally fine with it.I can't think of any other cons, so far I have experienced none.Conclusion: If you are looking for a mid budget mouse best suited for home and office uses, you do not want to miss it. Just give it a try and see for yourself.",
