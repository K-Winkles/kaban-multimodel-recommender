I love the sleek RBG, they put the LEDs in all the ideal places so it is not overbearing or too much. Great weight tuning with the included weights and iCue. Even the DPI adjustment buttons are out of the way despite being right there next to the left click button! Since my hands aren\u2019t too big I do have to move up my thumb a bit to hit the Sniper button but it\u2019s definitely still not uncomfortable.DPI adjustability is insane. Whatever sensitivity you prefer, and I quite literally mean whatever as in *any*, you can set it with this mouse. DPI adjustable from 1 all the way up to 18,000 by increments of just 1!",

                "reviewText": "Looks: great love the RGB works with my iCue main reason I went with a Corsair mouse is to sync with my keyboard, fans, etc.Performance: no issues, tracking is smooth. Lots of adjustments can be made to weight and DPI for user preferenceErgonomics: feels like it fits in my hand perfectly I love it.Material quality: I love the textured grip, the rubber wheel feels good. Only downside is the side buttons feel a bit cheap.Scroll wheel: has positive feedback with clicks per scroll which I like. Feels really good I am happy with it.Overall very happy with this mouse. I have quite a few mice like 7 or 8 right now and this is my main one that I use on my main gaming rig. I also have a Corsair FPS Pro and I much prefer this mouse over that one. Also have a Hyper X, 2 Logitech gaming, Microsoft ergo for work, a couple wireless Logitech for various uses. This is my preferred gaming mouse of all the ones I own.",

                "reviewText": "I have looked all over the internet for a mouse to be big enough for my large hands and my palm grip. Replaced my old Logitech G402 with this before button one quit working. The buttons are lighter and there are quite a few to map to any micro or function you want in the software. The software could use a bit of refinement, not as intuitive as I think it should be but once you have it the way you want it is rock solid.",

                "reviewText": "This mouse has a truly fantastic build quality across the board.Pros:I love the materials your hand rests on.The movement is smooth and has a nice feel/weight to itThe thumb rest is super comfy (thought I would hate it, but it's become one of my favorite features).The buttons all feel super responsive without any extra play. Perfect tactile response. Really a cut above the rest in this department.Cons:Can't rebind the DPI and profile buttons. No matter what I do in iCue, the DPI button won't remap, and the the profile buttons (which I think SHOULD be the DPI buttons) don't even give you the option to remap.This is kind of a major problem, because the DPI buttons are extremely easy to accidentally press when in a tough gaming moment. You can go in and swap all of your DPI settings to the same speed, but then you can't lower your DPI for shooting games and raise it back up for normal computer use like I do. If they can fix this, this is easily a 5 star mouse.EDIT: Forgot to mention that iCUE just randomly stops working quite often. This brings a host of other issues, the most important one being that you lose all buttons except left/right click and scroll. This is a HUGE problem and Corsair needs to fix this asap, because from my perspective as a consumer, I'm not getting the product I paid for.",

                "reviewText": "I have big hands. I bought the Logitech G604 light speed and it felt like it was made of paper. I miss the G602... We fought so many hours of battles I couldn't even count. I loved the grip of the 604 but it felt cheap and because there was no weight to it (the right clicker was defective anyway) I returned it. My hands said, \"I don't feel any love, where are you? Why don't you call or write?\" So, I decide to fork out some money for this mouse. I know, the Razer mice line has some great reviews, but not being able to go to a store and actually FEEL a mouse makes it hard to buy online. I've felt some Razers before. Razer is pricey. Perhaps they are as great as people say they are (even though idiots complain of \"bloatware\"). The Nightsword feels like the best in between Logitech and Razer. The right clicker does have this elevated edge that takes some getting used to. It feels like I am clicking on a mountain on the right side. It throws me off a bit. I wish they would have just left it flat or at least had not elevated it as much. However, soon, through muscle memory (all hail MM) my finger will begin to position itself in the right location. I've read people complain about the \"lip\" at the bottom of the thumb. I love how big it is. Remind me of the 602. This gives my thumb a platform to \"scoot n' shoot\". Definitely not an MMO mouse. Probably mouse was a bit more pricey due to the fact that it has RGB. RGB is cool only when your hand isn't on the mouse. So, if you don't play much but leave your computer on this is definitely the mouse for you. Being able to customize the lights is pretty cool and the DPI settings are just perfect.Let's talk about bloatware (\"There Will Be Blood voice\"). Bloatware complaints? Get a life. I have a Corsair keyboard that uses the same \"bloatware\". Get some more ram or a better CPU. Love this mouse and the custom weights it comes with. Reminds me of my old G602 (sheds some tears). I used the 602 back in 2009 and it is still $100. Get real. Get this one. As soon as my hand touched this I heard a voice come from my hand that said, \"I love you.\" I was a bit spooked at first but, I think this is a relationship that will actually work out. It may even last longer than my real life human to human relationships. Game on my friends.",

I have been using it for a few months now, and the buttons still work fine. The app that it comes with, (icue software) is actually very easy to use. You can change the button's layout as well as the colour scheme. The cord is long and has no issues, and the weights work nicely. Definitely recommend this as its good for long periods of usage as well as instant and accurate respond time.",
