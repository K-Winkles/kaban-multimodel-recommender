                "reviewText": "This mouse surprised me. I read so many bad reviews about the mouse itself or the software and I am so shocked that people feel the way they do. Sure the software isn't the best it could be but it works well and gets the job done. But I'll say I do not mess with it too much once I have things set how I like.I have been through so many mice over the last year.Coolermaster CM710 (incredible mouse but too small for my hands)Zowie EC2 (very slick and slips in my hands but is a good size. Cable is unbelievably thick and stiff though)Logitech G403 (as a mouse it's a great design but logitech's software is miserable and doesn't recognize the mouse half the time and between two of these G403's the left click went out within 2mo of playing FPS games where it became incredibly inconsistent in registering the click)Glorious Model D (great mouse overall but the cord got annoying. The Coolermaster cable is similar to this one but doesn't flail around and land on your hand like this one's does and even their own mouse bungee didn't secure the cord as it would slip out of the connector - but great quality mouse)Going through these mice is what led me to finally going with the Razer Mamba. I was ready to get away from dealing with cables now that the wireless tech seems to finally be here and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I have spent hundreds on them over the last year and I wasn't sure I'd like Razer so I wanted to keep the investment minimal. Well, despite buying this at a pretty low price (I believe around $50) it has become a top 3 favorite mouse for me. I know it's not some super fancy mouse with tons of features but all I really cared about was reliable wireless, forward/back buttons, a nice fit for my hand, not too heavy.So far after about 2 months this has been THE mouse for me. I don't know a lot about other Razer products but I will say that I will look to their mice before any other brand unless I experience something worth skipping them and so far I'm not seeing that happening. I will update if it does since i've only had it about 50 days but so far so great!",

                "reviewText": "I play FPS games (for example, Geometry Dash), and because of this, I needed a quality mouse to play with. I found this mouse and purchased it because I needed a wired mouse for quicker reaction time. And because it was cheaper than the wireless version anyway. I was pleased to find out how well it works. Nothing is perfect, and as expected, this mouse has a couple of setbacks, but overall, it works very well.Pros:Very smooth and reactive. It responds on most surfaces.There were no problems setting up Razer Synapse 3, and it was very easy to customize the RGBThe DPI range is quite impressive. While I personally don't go above 4,500 (and usually stick to 1,800), I'm sure it would be useful for other games.It's very durable and has a satisfying click sound.Cons:Due to how the mouse was packaged, the wire likes to coil itself upMy favorite DPI is 1,800, but it feels a little slow, but the next option (4,500) is way too fast. I wish that the DPI was either customized by a slider or digitally set in Razer Synapse.Overall, the Razer Mamba Elite is a very reliable gaming mouse. It's great for those with a lower budget. The purchase of this mouse has driven me to conclude that Razer is a reliable brand.",

Love it zero complaints much love Razer, Razer Please don't even think about discontinuing this model it's 99.99% perfect, that last 0.01% is the mouse is a bit chunky the upside to it being a little chunky is that it puts less strain on your hand the down side is if you have below average hand size this mouse might be a little unwieldy, I'm 6'3 with average to slightly above average (male) hand size",
