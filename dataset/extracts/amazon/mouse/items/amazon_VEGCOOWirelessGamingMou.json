Fits great in my hand, love the \"double click\", love the \"forward/back\" buttons on the side by the thumb! At first, I couldn't figure out why the heck it felt so heavy to move around on the mouse pad... Have to take the protective stickers off the sliders! LOL!! It moves like a dream! Love the fact that I could change the DPI so easily too! The changing colors are cool but I don't really get to admire those too much. Definitely a plug and play! The charging cable works great. I gave an overnight charge to be sure it would be ready for a full day of work. I might have to update once I have worked a bit with it on the battery life.***UPDATE*** Be sure to plug the usb receiver closest to the mouse, I have found that I had to move mine around a bit to make sure there's no interference with other wireless items. It seemed like the mouse had a mind of it's own for a bit and that's what fixed the problem.",

The battery had to be charged every two days. Whenever I ran out I could still use it while it was charging. Accuracy was very good. Had a little trouble getting the right resolution at the start but once set it stays as long as the charge is kept up. In the past 6 months I have not been gaming and the mouse has held it's charge easily for more than 30 days.",
