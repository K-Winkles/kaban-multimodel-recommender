I notice if I\u2019m sitting and don\u2019t touch it for awhile it seems to sleep I have to click so it connects or moves again. Idk if that\u2019s a function mentioned as I just brought it because it was reasonably priced and cute and I love foxes \ud83e\udd8a but I love that added feature when reading and editing work. The little usb cover is equally adorable \u263a\ufe0f if it wasn\u2019t so unnecessary I would probably by another lol \ud83d\ude02 it brings me enjoy so I wish I could have two but I don\u2019t have another computer lol but I\u2019m happy I treated myself to this. I\u2019ve used it for a bout four five days now.",

I was looking for a mouse with a USB-C dongle but came across this one that has a USB-A dongle but also the option of using Bluetooth to pair it to my computer. The Bluetooth option works great so I'm more than happy with that. It's very quiet and the scrolling works great. My only complaint is that it is a little bit bigger than I expected.",
