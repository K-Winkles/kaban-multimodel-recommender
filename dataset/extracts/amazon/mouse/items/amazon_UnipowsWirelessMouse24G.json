Ordered two from Amazon, and this one is BY FAR my favorite of the two. I was worried that it was so flat, but turns out it's much more comfortable under my hand than others I have tried. It clicks so nice and quietly (no more \"mom! stop all the clicking!\" when I'm working in the family room in the evenings!), and I love the little roller ball, too! Great little gadget for a great little price!",

But it is very easy to set up, there is no installation required, and it is GREAT for the price!!",

I love the one I am using. Lower profile, a bit wider than logitech, quieter, light but solid feeling. It moves much smoother across the mousepad.The only thing that has been bothering me is that I have to shut it off and one again when Windows 11 sleeps. Yes, I changed the Device Setting for it and Power Management so that it would still wake the machine. I also removed and let it reinstall driver. Since I haven't figured out if there is some other issue that is causing it, I am not blaming the mouse for this behavior....yet. Regardless, I would still choose this mouse because of the comfort level.",
