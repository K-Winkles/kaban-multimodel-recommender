                "reviewText": "Look, I know this mouse looks weird as hell. It does. However, I find it to be probably one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used, and definitely the easiest ergonomic mouse to use. Does anyone else remember those awful ball-type mice where you moved the ball with your thumb?? No thank you.I have not had any difficulties with my hand falling off, although I do have to remind myself to kind of \"spread out\" my fingers, as it were, so that I have the weight of my fingers evenly distributed. I did not find it hard to transition to using the new position for the forward/backward buttons, but sometimes it takes me a split second to get at the middle click, as well as to click without also scrolling; I think this will go away over time. I find the height to work well with my hand, and my long fingers do just fine (I wear a size M disposable glove, if you want to compare your hand against mine). I can use it with my mouse pad with the gel wrist rest without issue.I notice that Amazon wants a start ranking for gaming, but I don't think I would want to use this for gaming. Not that you couldn't... I just feel like the precision that I want for that purpose would be harder to get with this type of mouse? Not that you couldn't get there, I think, with some practice. The response time for this mouse is no worse than my traditional-style Logitec M510.One advantage to having a weird-looking mouse: no one will ever steal it from you, especially if you get it in a weird color (not that the pink isn't nice; it's a very pretty pastel pink, and true to how it looks on my screen).",

The description says that it's for small to medium hands but I wear large men's gloves and I find it to be a perfect size. It's smaller size allows me to pack it in the lap top bag. It's powered by a battery so if you are used to a chargeable unit, that might be a pain for you. But thus far, it has not been a problem for me.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I'm very happy with this mouse.I'm a CAD drafter, and have been using a standard gaming mouse for many years. I'm beginning to develop hand and wrist pain and tried one of Logitech's other ergonomic options about two years ago and found it was too large for my hands. When I found out about this smaller version I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be helping with the wrist pain specifically, and was very easy to transition to this style. I read several other reviews that said it doesn't have Bluetooth, but they must be reviewing some other product because this one definitely has Bluetooth, and it works very well. I've had no issues whatsoever with connectivity. It is very quiet, too, so if you're noise-senstive this one is probably a good choice for you. I can barely hear the clicks. If you go on the Logitech website and look up this mouse, you'll see a link to the software that you can download to customize the programmable buttons, and to choose your specific preferences for how the mouse works. I can't comment yet on longevity or battery life, because I've only been using it for about two weeks. I do wish it had more programmable buttons, but I suppose I've been spoiled by using a gaming mouse for so long. For most people two programmable buttons is probably plenty.",
