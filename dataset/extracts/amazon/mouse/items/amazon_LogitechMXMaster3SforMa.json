                "reviewText": "As a video editor who's constantly toggling between my 16\" M1 MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and occasionally other devices, I've found a trusty sidekick in the Logitech MX Master 3S for Mac. This mouse isn't just a tool; it's my editing and productivity wand.The ease of switching between devices is akin to magic. Just like its cousin, the MX Keys keyboard, the transition is seamless. I can be trimming a clip on my MacBook and then switch to my iPad for some quick graphic work with just a click. It's like having multiple assistants at my beck and call.Now, let's talk about the programmability - a video editor's dream. The Logi app transforms this mouse into a Swiss Army knife of shortcuts and functions. Every button, scroll wheel, and gesture can be customized to my workflow. It's like having a bespoke suit; everything is tailored exactly to my needs, making editing a breeze and saving me precious time.Need to make custom program-specific hotkeys? Consider it done!The ergonomics are top-notch, too. After hours of editing, my wrist and hand still feel as fresh as a daisy. The mouse fits my hand like it was custom-made for it, and the strategically placed thumb controls are a godsend.And the battery life? I get a solid 2-3 weeks of all-day use on a single charge. It's like the Energizer Bunny of mice - it just keeps going and going. Plus, with USB-C charging, I'm back in action quickly when it does need a boost.Some people have mentioned connectivity hiccups, but I've never experienced one.In short, the Logitech MX Master 3S for Mac is a powerhouse mouse that's transformed my editing workflow. It's comfortable, customizable, and keeps up with my demanding schedule. If you're a video editor or a multi-device power user, this mouse is a no-brainer.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Mac mouse that is great for work and playing a Third-Person Shooting game",
                "reviewText": "I have been using this Mac version of the Logitec mouse for about eight days. I rate this mouse 10/10 because it works as it is supposed to and is very comfortable to hold on to for a long time for both work and game. I want a Mac mouse that:1. is Comfortable/Ergonomic;2. can use the forward and backward buttons for moving PowerPoint slides forward and backward during slide show presentations for work;3. has a dedicated horizontal scroll button;4. can play a Mac game Code of War 2-Striker Zone, a third-person shooting game;5. does not need any USB dongle.This mouse satisfies all my five requirements.1. My right hand is not as big as many adult men's hands, but my right hand is comfortably resting on this mouse (see the attached picture). The rubber on the mouse gives the texture that makes the mouse even more comfortable to hold on to for a long time. To me, if the mouse is ergonomic, it should be comfortable. So I assume these two terms are equivalent.2. My old mouse cannot use the forward and backward buttons to move the PowerPoint slides forward and backward. I install Logitech Option+ software. I can customize all buttons on the mouse for almost every software I use on my MacBook. I am very happy with this because I can now use the forward and backward buttons during my PowerPoint presentations.3. My old mouse does not have a horizontal scroll button. The horizontal scroll button in this mouse is extremely helpful for me, especially for scrolling my spreadsheet. I love this feature.4. There are not many cool games in the Mac environment, but I like to play this third-person shooting game Code of War 2: Striker Zone. With the Logitech Option+ software, I can adjust the pointer speed that fits my needs for this game. Perhaps I am not a professional gamer like other reviewers, I do not notice any lag even though I only use the Bluetooth connection.5. The fact that this Mac version mouse does not come with a USB dongle is something that I look for. My MacBook does not have any USB A ports. My old mouse comes with a USB dongle that I need to use an adaptor to plug into the thunderbolt port on my MacBook every time I use the old mouse. Whenever I take out my MacBook and the old mouse, I will have to look for the dongle+adaptor as well. I love this Mac mouse because I do not need to put anything on the thunderbolt port to use this Mac version of the Logitech mouse. It saves me a lot of hassle when I take out my laptop every day to work.Regarding the negatives other reviewers mentioned, they are not issues for me. For example, a clicking sound is fine. All the previous mice I owned before had the clicking sound, so I used to hear the clicking sound. The clicking sound actually gives me acoustic feedback to confirm that I press the button. As mentioned above, I do not notice any lag when I play my favorite third-person shooting game. But I have not tried playing other more popular FPS games on my MacBook (if available), and I am not a professional gamer for sure. All the buttons and functions work perfectly as they should. I do not notice any skipping or interruption during working and gaming. So far, I have not charged my mouse yet.I am happy with this purchase :-)",

                "reviewText": "Admittedly, I was slightly hesitant when buying this. I knew I wanted a new mouse but didn't know how \"fancy\" I wanted to go. Amazon suggested this mouse paired with a keyboard I was buying and I went for it, full send!This mouse has been nothing short of amazing. it is extremely comfortable and ergonomic. The controls are great and quick to find/get used to. I use a Mac and all of the features work well and are compatible with it. That was a big thing for me too.The battery life has been excellent. At the time of writing, I have not had to charge it yet! The mouse is very responsive to any movements I make.One thing i had to do was buy a mouse pad for it. But I think this is mostly due to the surface I was using it on. After that I had 0 issues!",

                "reviewText": "I was struggling with my magic mouse due to the increase in computer time I was dealing with at my job recently. Hand was cramping up by the end of the day especially by my thumb. The controls are great, you can customize any setting most people could think to worry about. Very easy for me as a special ed teacher to go back and forth from school ipad and macbook seamlessly. Works like a dream without a mouse pad too if you have limited space for a mouse. 10/10 recommend, I honestly prefer this over my apple magic mouse now. Battery is great, have been using it for over a week at work and still have not charged it from opening it out of the box.",
