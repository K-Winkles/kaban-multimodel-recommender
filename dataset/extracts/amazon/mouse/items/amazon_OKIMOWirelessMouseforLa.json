The sensor only flashes once when the battery is inserted causing a misconception that the mouse is defective, but this is a normal situation. 2. Forget to plug into the USB receiver. The mouse has no light up after inserting into the mouse, Does that mean the mouse is defective? It's normal when inserted into the battery but the USB receiver doesn't plug into the laptop. Only when the USB receiver is plugged into the mouse, the sensor will flash all the time. Please refer to the instruction video on the page. Is the mouse controlled by Bluetooth? how does it work? The mouse is controlled by 2.4 GHz wireless so need to plug into the USB receiver which is stored at the back of the mouse, and next to the battery component. If don't plug the USB receiver, the mouse doesn't work.",

                "reviewText": "The bottom review was for the original 2 orders of that model of mouse. Since that review, the company reached out to me and apologized for the defective mice and asked if I would accept a new mouse free of charge to try. I was shocked at their level of professionalism and customer service, as you simply do not get that with most companies any more. I accepted their offer and we have now been using theLED Wireless Mouse, Slim Silent Mouse 2.4G Portable Mobile Optical Office Mouse with USB & Type-c Receiver, 3 Adjustable DPI Levels for Notebook, PC, Laptop, Computer, MacBook and it is working very well.This is my first review of the defective mice:OKIMO Wireless Mouse for Laptop Computer Mouse with USB Receiver 2.4GHz Optical Tracking Computer Cordless Mouse Ergonomic Portable Mouse for PC Mac Laptop Chromebook (Black)________________________________________Cyber Monday Deal-63% $7.99 List Price: $21.49Bought the 1st mouse, it arrived and the cover that goes over the battery kept sliding off. Amazon sent a replacement and had the one I ordered picked up. The replacement arrived, worked the first day, then would not work at all. It appears there is a reason these are on sale\u2026Amazon CS told me they would refund and I did not need to return the 2nd defective mouse \u2013 it\u2019s new home is now the trash.It was an extremely cheaply made, plastic mouse. Would not recommend at all. Have used many a mouse over the years, and this was by far the worst one yet.",
