                "reviewText": "I had been resisting getting a wireless mouse for a long time because of bad experiences with them in the past, but it seems all I can find in wired mice these days are cheap construction where something stops working just after the warranty expires.This mouse has actually been great for that. It's comfortable, it's extremely quiet, and I'm still on its first battery with no signs of fading. I like that it comes with its own receiver, as well, since that allows me to easily switch it between my home and work computers through my KVM switch just like a wired one, as opposed to having to deal with Bluetooth pairing and connecting.My only complaint is that the buttons are extremely easy to press - I can just barely rest my finger on one and have it click, which sometimes causes some undesired actions. When I do intend to click a button, the action is quick, quiet, and it feels nice. It just could stand to offer a little more resistance.Other than that, I've been very happy with this little guy.

                "reviewText": "I don't often write a review, but I wanted everyone out there to know how happy I am with this mouse. After using the Logitech m325 mouse for years, I noticed that after long hours of work sometimes my index finger's tendon would hurt from repetitive clicking. So I went in search of an easy to click mouse. I first tried the new logitech m240, which has the SilentTouch technology, and I was super pleased with how easy to click the left and right mouse buttons were (and totally silent!). However, the scroll wheel for the m240 took a good amount of effort to scroll, which I did not like.I next tried the new logitech mx anywhere 3s, which has a great scroll wheel, but the left and right buttons require about the same pressure to click as did the buttons on the m325 (and although logitech touts this mouse as quiet or silent, it is certainly audible, though much less so than the m325).After a bit more research, I saw that this m650 has the SilentTouch technology, so I got it. The left and right moues buttons are silent and suuuper easy to click. the scroll wheel is also silent, and also nearly effortless to scroll. while not as nice as the scroll wheel on the mx anywhere series, it does allow hyper scrolling, and is perfectly fine for my needs.Additionally, the mouse is quite lightweight.the USB Bolt adapter works well, although I don't quite understand why it's a USB-A instead of a USB-C type, as I have noticed that laptops have been doing away with USB-A ports for some time now (like Apple Macbooks).In summary, I didn't see any review that specifically commented on how EASY TO CLICK this mouse is, and in case you are searching for a mouse for a person with hand tendonitis or other overuse injury, I would definitely recommend the m650.",

                "reviewText": "When choosing a mouse there are hundreds of options available, but Logitech is known in the industry as the strongest and best mice out there which is why I selected this one although it is a little more expensive than the knock-off Chinese mice, and don't have some of the added features like RGB. This is a wireless mouse and has two types of connecting wirelessly: (1) Using the included Logi Bolt connector; and (2) using generic Bluetooth if your computer has that. The advantage of using Bluetooth is you spare the extra USB port which, otherwise, would be occupied by the Logi Bolt dongle. The disadvantage of using Bluetooth is if you want to use mouse functions while making BIOS settings, that's not available, since Bluetooth is established after the operating system (Windows) is booted up. I didn't find this out until I tried it and noticed to my disappointment the mouse didn't work which making adjustments in BIOS. This may not be a problem for most people if you don't go into your BIOS settings, but for me I'm setting up a new computer and need the mouse to work in BIOS.The problem I ran into is this: I had no difficulty setting up the Bluetooth connection for this mouse, although there's just a tiny bit of latency (lag) which is hardly noticeable. After I decided to connect with the Logi Bolt receiver, however, and disconnected the Bluetooth, the mice wouldn't recognize the dongle. I tried updating the firmware but the Logi Options software couldn't find the mouse, saying it was \"inactive\". I rebooted the PC several times, unplugged and re-plugged the dongle, removed and re-inserted the mouse battery, etc, with no change. The action which finally fixed the problem was to REMOVE the mouse from the Logi Options software (click on the image of the trash can below the mouse image on the main page), then click \"Add a Device\" upper right of the same page, and it takes you through the set up finally recognizing both the Logi Bolt receiver and the M650 mouse. There is a support page I had gone to which gives a list of steps, but it did not mention deleting and adding the mouse as one of the steps. So now I'm good. Here are some PROS and CONS, although my experience is just a few hours old:PROS:- The mouse feels really good. It has rubberized sides with a \"wave\" design as one reviewer described it. The weight it good so it feels substantial. It is well made.- I chose this mouse partly because I wanted a white mouse, which matches my keyboard and PC, it is an off-white with gray accents so good looking.- It works great (now that I got it working), is very responsive, and adjustable either through the Logi Options software or through Windows Mouse Settings (note in CONS about \"smooth scrolling\" option).- Battery life is rated at 2 years (good Duracell AA battery is included) which is phenomenal! This is one great advantage of NOT having RGB. I'm also glad I don't have to charge the mouse all the time.- Firmware update is quick and easy though the Logi Options software, so any future problems can be addressed by Logitech using firmware updates.- It's also a plus that Logitech provides software (Logi Options) although you have to download it (just google it).CONS:- As described above, changing connection type was a painful learning curve.- Using Bluetooth means mouse use isn't available in BIOS (although this would be true with any mouse)- More expensive than no-name brands, but to some extent you get what you pay for.- There is a setup option in the Logi Options software to set the vertical scroll wheel for \"Smooth Scrolling\", but the result is there is a distracting lag whenever you use the scroll wheel; it is much better in my experience to set this off.Bottom line, I really like this mouse and hope to keep using it for many years to come. It feels good, looks good, and works wonderfully. Good luck in your mouse hunting adventures!",

                "reviewTitle": "Great mouse. You get what you pay for....",
                "reviewText": "Was looking to replace an older Logitech Bluetooth rechargeable mouse that started to lose it's ability to hold a charge after many years of use. Decided to replace it with a battery-powered Bluetooth mouse that would hopefully give me at least a year of use on a fresh Duracell. Also wasn't looking to spend a lot of money on the purchase.To that end, I settled on a Bluetooth mouse by Tecknet, sold here on Amazon.ca. It had the features I was looking for, essentially Bluetooth and battery-powered, with side buttons for back/forward web-page navigating. It cost $19.99 and the reviews were largely favourable, so I purchased it.On receipt, it felt very light-weight and looked and felt like cheapy plastic -- but the real test was it's performance, or lack of it. As the title of this review states, you really do get what you pay for, and this one didn't cost much. The clicks were loud. The on-screen cursor was erratic and sticky, all-in-all difficult to control despite my having cycled through the dpi settings repeatedly, and despite having played with the system's mouse settings (current Windows version), hoping for a fix. This erratic and sticky cursor issue emerged after using the mouse for only a handful of days on a proper mouse surface. Equally troubling was a problem with the mouse entering \"sleep mode\" whenever idle for more than a few minutes. That would not have been an issue at all if it woke up upon movement, but it never did. Instead, each time I had to press the Bluetooth connection button on the underside of the mouse to re-establish contact with the PC. That Tecknet mouse was simply not usable so I packaged it up and returned it to Amazon.I had never had such issues, indeed any issues, with Logitech products (other than losing the ability to hold a charge over time). So, I purchased the battery-powered Bluetooth/USB Logitech M650 L in Ferrari \"red\" at $39.99. Well...what a difference 20 bucks makes. This Logitech is rock-solid -- the materials and build skate circles around the Tecknet mouse -- and the clicks are virtually silent. The \u2018smart\u2019 mouse wheel spins smooth as silk, the side buttons are well positioned, and the feel of the mouse \u2014 meaning its weight, texture and contours \u2014 under the palm of the hand is ergonomically delicious. The cursor reacts on-screen exactly as intended...doesn't skip a beat and lands precisely where directed. And, the battery life is stated as 2 full years (which likely assumes that you slide the underside power switch to 'off', as I always do, whenever the PC is shut down). A nice bonus is that a fresh Duracell battery is included with the mouse, and the unit is both Bluetooth and USB compatible (a USB dongle is located inside the battery compartment).This Logitech M650 L costs a little more than the Tecknet mouse, but feels and performs like it's 5 times the cost. Worth every penny of the difference.BTW, I opted for the \"L\" model (as in M650 \"L\", which stands for....you guessed it, \"Large\"), and is supposedly designed for a larger hand. My hands are average-size male hands, about 18 cm's from tip of middle finger to base of palm, and the \"L\" model is a perfect, comfortable fit. I therefore think the standard size M650 (without the \"L\" after the model number) might be a little too compact for my mousing hand. I wasn't certain about going with the \u201cL\u201d model when I ordered the mouse, but I'm glad I did.Hope you find this review helpful.",
