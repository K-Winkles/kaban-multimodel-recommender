However, my hand rests perfectly with this mouse and clicking functions is seamless with the design. I have noticed I can work for much longer without my hands becoming sore. I use this for remote office work, and online school. There is no issue with speed and the long battery life is amazing due to its sleep mode technology that is a simple click to wake up. The wake up is instant and I have never had issues with delays.Highly recommend to anyone looking for what I argue some of the best value you will be able to find.",

                "reviewText": "After my beloved Logitech M35 reached the end of its life cycle, I settled on cheap little mini mice to get by, until I couldn't take it anymore. So I nabbed this unknown (to me) brand mouse based on its features, looks and user reviews. The price point sealed the deal, it's quite a steal. It feels feather-light until you insert a single AA battery, which helps give it a little heft. The ergonomic style is totally Logitech, but that's good. Feels very comfortable, all buttons accessible with ease. I have medium-sized hands and it's a perfect fit, not too small, not too big. I also chose this mouse because I wanted two side buttons (forward & back navigation), which I use a lot. Finally, this mouse features 5 selectable DPI modes, changed via a button on top. Great for precision cursor movement, ie Photoshop, etc. Excellent purchase, very happy.",

After dropping it from my desk one time (less than 3 feet and onto an area rug), it broke and no longer works. I've dropped pretty much every mouse I've ever owned multiple times each and none have simply failed like this one did.Very disappointed.UPDATEThe same day this review was posted, the seller reached out with a solution. I was really surprised at how quickly they were there to help with my issue. I upgraded my 2-star review to a 3-star review for now. Once their resolution is complete, I will re-evaluate and revise my review accordingly.Customer service is huge in my book, so while I had an issue with the product, I am impressed with the service aspect",
