                "reviewText": "I picked this up a while back to use for my laptop when I work from home, and as a spare for my main desktop setup. I normally use a wired mouse with my desktop/gaming pc, but recently starting using this one in it's place for regular duties and some FPS gaming.I chose this mouse because it uses the pixart PAW3370, which is one of the top optical sensors for mice right now when it comes to tracking accuracy. I Also chose it because it has a few extra buttons on top (aside from the usual 2 side buttons). I like to bind the extra buttons on top of the mouse for some in-game functions instead of using my keyboard.the mouse is a bit heavier than the current crop of super light weight mice, but it's still way lot lighter than my old G602 that had batteries in it. it has a built-in battery, so that keeps the weight down. battery life seems pretty decent so far. I usually am online only for a few hours a day, and it's lasted a couple weeks and I have yet to charge it. it will also work in wired mode, so you can use it while it charges. it has 2 \"on\" modes: one with the full RGB lighting, and one that is like ECO mode, that let's you run with no lights, or with minimal lighting. both modes allow you to run 1000hz polling rates.The left and right buttons are a little stiffer than my Asus mouse, but it doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and it's only noticeable when going from one mouse to the other. the other buttons on the mouse feel good and are on par with any other well known name-brand mouse.The software is very easy to use, and is simple and lightweight. I wish more companies would make their mouse software like this. it allows you to set profiles, change lighting, bind the buttons, and program macros. then lets you save it all to the on-board mouse memory, and then you can close the software and never run it again. There are multiple DPI settings you can set, and/or turn on or off completely, a page for lighting controls, macro programming, button assignments, polling rate, speed settings, etc. Basically all the typical mouse settings you'd ever need.After matching the dpi to my other mouse, I can say this mouse performs just as well as many more expensive mice. The only difference I could feel was this mouse wasn't quite as \"fast\" as my other one. the mouse skates weren't as slick. I didn't mind though, and I was still able to aim accurately and quickly.After a few days I noticed that there was some plastic pealing up on one of the mouse skates. They have a protective film on them! this wasn't noticeable before, but after I peeled off all of the film, the mouse was sliding faster and easier, so make sure you check the mouse skates for the film.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Reddragon M991 mouse, and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by the quality it offers, especially considering its affordable price. This mouse provides excellent value for money, and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.One of the standout features of the Reddragon M991 is its stunning RGB lighting. The illumination on this mouse is absolutely beautiful, adding a touch of style and customization to my gaming setup. The vibrant colors and various lighting effects create an immersive visual experience that enhances the overall gaming atmosphere.In terms of ergonomics, the Reddragon M991 excels. The grip is nothing short of perfect, offering a comfortable and secure hold during extended gaming sessions. As someone with larger hands, I particularly appreciate the weight of this mouse. It strikes a perfect balance, providing a satisfying heaviness that enhances precision and control. Lighter mice often feel flimsy and lack the stability I desire, but the Reddragon M991 caters perfectly to my preferences.While the mouse itself performs admirably, it's worth mentioning that the accompanying software leaves much to be desired. The functionality is limited and somewhat lacking, which is a shame considering its potential. However, this minor drawback doesn't significantly impact the overall experience for me. I find the mouse perfectly usable without relying heavily on the software, and it doesn't diminish my overall satisfaction with the product.All in all, the Reddragon M991 is an excellent purchase, especially for those seeking an affordable yet high-quality gaming mouse. Its value for money is exceptional, and the combination of beautiful RGB lighting and ergonomic design sets it apart from its competitors. Despite the software's limitations, the mouse itself performs admirably and caters to those who prefer a slightly heavier feel. I highly recommend the Reddragon M991 to anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly gaming mouse.",
