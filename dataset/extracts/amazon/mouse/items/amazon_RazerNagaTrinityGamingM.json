The seven button side is my favorite as it allows positive thumb placement without the risk of accidentally hitting a button and the radial setup of the buttons makes for easy selection of the correct macro button. Swapping sides on the mouse is simple an easy and auto loads my preset macros making working in AutoCAD or swapping to play a game quick. Razor Synapse is also easy to work with allowing me to quickly create custom macros for specific projects. The mouse wheel gives good tactile feedback and doesn\u2019t accidentally scroll with fast movement of the mouse. Tracking is precise on most surfaces, even when I\u2019m lazily browsing kicked back in my chair using my leg as a mouse pad.Delivery was quick and the mouse arrived with the packaging and contents undamaged. I would buy again.",

It\u2019s a really well built mouse with tons of buttons!I have owned a few different brands but keep coming back to the naga. If you are on a budget the Red Dragon version is really really good especially at the price point.Overall if you can spend the money on it, get it. If not go with the Red Dragon version. All other brands need some sort of modification to enjoy.Cheers",

At first it was smooth, but 24h later, the scroll started feeling hard to use. In the meantime, I had already ordered a 2nd identical mouse. Same issue after just 2h! These are probably the worst mice I've ever had. Returning them asap. Don't waste your money!Googled the issue and I'm not the only one with the exact same issue.Razer, this is unacceptable!",

                "reviewText": "Llevo 20 a\u00f1os jugando a MMOs y con diferencia, este es el rat\u00f3n que m\u00e1s he disfrutado de usar. Solia usar ratones de 6 botones en el lateral, el \u00faltimo el Logitech G604, pero \u00faltimamente he tenido muy mala suerte con productos Logitech, el 604 uno de los botones que frecuentemente suelo machacar m\u00e1s, simplemente se rompio, tanto en el rat\u00f3n que compr\u00e9 como en el reemplazo que me enviaron (en este \u00faltimo hasta se cay\u00f3 del todo!).Un amigo me recomend\u00f3 el Naga, y prob\u00e9. Hay que decir que hay un periodo de adaptaci\u00f3n de aprox. 1 mes para acostumbrate bien a su uso, pero una vez hecho no hay marcha atr\u00e1s. Es super facil y c\u00f3modo de configrar, la forma y angulo de los botones dejan identificar cada bot\u00f3n individual con facilidad, y el rat\u00f3n es super ligero y preciso. Y lo mejor, por mucho que machaco los botones, funcionan igual de bien que el pimer dia - la calidad de fabricaci\u00f3n es impecable, se nota que est\u00e1 hecho para durar.El unico punto negativo que le podr\u00eda dar, es que quiz\u00e1s para personas que tengan las manos muy grandes y dedos muy gruesos y toscos, sea dificil de usar los botones puesto que son relativamente peque\u00f1os.",
