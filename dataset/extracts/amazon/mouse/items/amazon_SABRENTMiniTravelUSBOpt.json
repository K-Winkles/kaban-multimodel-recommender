                "reviewText": "I needed something small/portable and don't like wireless. I love the little cushy case it comes with. I think it would be bad for gaming as it's tiny and not many buttons- also I can't say it's ergonomic- but that's not why you buy this. For your laptop when you are travelling- it is perfect. I read the other reviews, which said you could break the wire- and yes, I can see that. So, I am extra careful when I pull it out and put it back. It IS fragile- but just be careful. It's common sense. This is made to travel, not be your everyday mouse.",

                "reviewText": "I've been working from home using just a Surface laptop but I got tired of using the touchpad and decided it was time to invest in a mouse. I didn't want anything too fancy since it was just for working from home so I decided to buy this one as it was a fair price and it's small size made it easy to travel with.Overall, the mouse itself is good. It does its job just fine and since it's USB connected you can just plug and go. No need for any drivers or downloads. The clicking can be a bit loud sometimes, especially if you are doing it a lot and notice it but it's not a dealbreaker. Scrolling works great and the mouse cord itself can be extended depending on how long you need it to be.However, it does have its cons as well. The mouse tends to suddenly move across the page every now and then. I use it every day and it does it very infrequently but when it does do it you'll get very annoyed. Another thing it does that I hate is that for some reason it thinks you're holding the left click down as if to highlight. You'll randomly be moving the cursor and you'll be highlighting everything on the page. This one does happen very often and is why this product is not getting five stars.",

The fact that the wire can be automatically wrapped up is great for portability, but this mechanism doesn't seem very sturdy. Still even if that functionality fails, the mouse should still be usable.",

It functions well in all respects and I like the form factor better than that of most other computer mice I've used.I find the default pointer motion on Windows annoyingly slow/unresponsive. I turn mine up to eleven, so I can use this tiny mouse on a 5\"x6\" mouse pad (I could use an even smaller one if I could find one) and take up a minimal amount of desk space.Yes, the cord is thin, but that's so it can wrap around the little spool when retracted. I've never found that to be an issue. I've used a similar style of retractable-cord mouse mouse for years and I've never had the wire wear out, even though the buttons have failed over time from heavy use, but I guess everyone's use case is different.Dimensions: L = 8.2 cm; W = 4.9 cm, H = 2.9 cm. 3.2\" x 1.9\" x 1.1\". Perfect size for small or large hands.",
