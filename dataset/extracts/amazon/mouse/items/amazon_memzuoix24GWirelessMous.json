                "reviewText": "I got this mouse to replace an old Logitech mouse that I had for more than a few years. The old mouse had just worn out over time, and it would take more than a few clicks to get the computer to respond. At first I blamed my computer and swore I would throw it out the window. Luckily I decided to go the cheaper route and get a new mouse. This mouse had good reviews, and at 48% off was a great deal. I received the mouse quickly and once I plugged in the dongle, inserted the AAA batteries and turned it on it really took off. I had to go into settings and adjust the mouse cursor speed and scrolling speed to my preferred settings and it is working GREAT. I like that it has the sleep function to save battery life. It is not a big deal to push a button to activate the mouse after it is unused for 7 or 8 minutes depending on which part of the description you read. I go the red one and I really like the matt finish. The chrome bezel around the scrolling wheel adds a nice touch. The forward and back button on the side are a nice addition, but I doubt if I will use them much. All in all it was a great purchase and I am very happy with the new mouse. OBTW instead of the computer, the old mouse was thrown out the window.",

It's must have for the CAD software I use for my desk top laser/etcher. It has taken me awhile to get used to the track pad on my lap top but still prefer to use a mouse when i'am sitting at a table or work bench. I like the way this feels in my hand, best one yet. I have to use a USB to USBC adapter on my Mac Book but I have to use on to connect my laser so it's not a issue at all. I am not a big fan of the feel of a Mac mouse and Mac seems to have the only Bluetooth mouse that work well according to the reviews that I have read.",
