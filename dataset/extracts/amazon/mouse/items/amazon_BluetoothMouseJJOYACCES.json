                "reviewText": "Bluetooth means that I don't have to remove the USB dongle from my laptop, and don't need to care about ripping a USB port when I put my laptop in my bag. And still having a USB dongle makes it easy for using with new devices without having to pair the Bluetooth.Only downside is that the sleep mode requires you to click once in a while, which I find annoying. But at least the battery life is satisfactory.I wouldn't use it for working from a single location, but it is perfect to carry with you, or use during travel. The mouse is also sturdy, which is a plus for carrying around.To sum up, this is a very good product for it's price, in particular if you plan to travel or commute a lot. Just don't forget to also carry some spare batteries ;-) (I use rechargeable batteries).",

It was honestly such a wonderful buy. It came on time. It fits right in my palm and isn't too big or small. Best thing: NO ANNOYING CLICKS!! It's also very sleek and matches the black on my laptop incredibly well. I've carried it around with me and used it on different surfaces and it works great on pretty much everything.10/10 would recommend",

Also, I don't have any connection problems. After some time being idle, it disconnects and if I move the mouse it reconnects after 3-4 seconds. which is not bad. As someone who works with a computer all day (for so many years now), I'm satisfied with this mouse.OLD REVIEWAt first, it seemed it was not working well, and I wrote a negative review. But I gave it another shot and strangely enough, it is working well now. The build quality is not bad and the movement is smooth.I have two problems now. 1: I have to press the right button hard. otherwise it's not working. 2: When I don't touch the mouse for a few minutes (maybe 10 to 15 minutes), it disconnects and I have to move the mouse, press the buttons, and wait for about 10 seconds for it to reconnect (in Bluetooth mode).The seller offered me a free replacement or refund which is very good. The replacement may not have the right-button problem.",

Criteria for the new mouse were:* bluetooth plus adapter (have not used a bluetooth mouse before, wanted to try, but to have adapter as backup).*low profile*ambidextrous*good scroll wheelThis mouse fits all of the criteria very well. I especially like the knurled metal scroll wheel. Buttons are silent and positive, and fine positioning is easy. It works well on both bluetooth and adapter, and easy to switch between them, though I find there is a bit more of a delay in mouse response when starting up on bluetooth. Once going, response is perfect.Slightly surprised that the scroll wheel only has a switch function when pushed to the right, nothing to the left. But I hardly ever use that, so not a problem. Happy with it.",
