Single plastic peice makes up entire mouse aside the scroller which is works like a charm, so no buttons to fall off, accurate, fits in hand comfortably, responsive and sturdy build. 100% recommendation. 5 stars well earned.",

It works and did not cost much. I think you could spend a little more money and get something more comfortable and more quiet.If you are going to use a mouse all day, this is not what you want. I use it occasionally in an environment that is not clean and it is great for that. If it stops working, I am not out much.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this Logitech M90 mouse to replace a much older (ancient 10yrs+) Logitech 3 button mouse that is dying / nolonger fully functional (scroll wheel finally stopped working).The product arrived quick and ahead of schedule from the seller. The product arrived in a padded small parcel envelope, packaging shows very minor /slight damage from shipping - box got slightly bumped around and squeezed a bit, but the mouse inside arrived intact and undamaged. Since this product is just a basic mouse - in a forgettable recyclable basic plain green retail box with a printed picture of the mouse, I'm not worried about the packaging looking a little dented inside the envelope on arrival. Had this been a collectable/collectors type item (collectable figurines, etc) with retail packaging I'd actually want to keep / display, I would have been disappointed, knocking off a few stars and contacting the seller, and asking why hadn't better care and use of cardboard shipping box be used. As I said, this item is a basic mouse, arrived in working condition, no stars deducted from the review.Only item included was a small folded warranty info paper pamphlet. No driver disk, however the M90 is basic and generic enough to be detected and supported by almost every current OS out there (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc), no drivers are needed (Compared to a higher spec multi-button gaming mouse).The M90 is a two-tone matt-black finish top, matt-dark grey sides, full sized basic 3 button scroll-wheel corded optical mouse. 2 buttons + clickable middle scroll wheel, decent length cord and USB-A connector. The shape, design and size of the M90 is similar to the mouse I was replacing, and it fits very comfortably in the palm of my hand, even after hours of continuous use. The underside is lit by a red LED for the optic tracking unit and otherwise not noticeable. Very affordable for under $20.00 with free Prime shipping, compared to other mice priced well above $25.00 Very satisfied!I didn't need 5+ buttons, LED lighting, or wireless connectivity (and the hassle of recharging / replacing batteries that comes with wireless peripherals), or button toggle sensitivity/speed features. I just wanted a regular mouse for every day use and occasional gaming.I continue to choose Logitech simply for their build quality and longevity of their hardware. I've tried and wasted money on other brands in the past, only to be going back to Logitech when those other brands have failed within 6-12 months.I plugged this new mouse in and it simply works. Some people may want to adjust the mouse cursor speed & sensitivity to their liking, but I was happy with the defaults. The mouse is very responsive and works fine for gaming. As noted, if you want faster / sensitive cursor movement etc, it can be configured in your OS mouse peripheral settings.I will buy from this seller again when I have another old mouse needing replacement.",
