                "reviewText": "This mouse has a lot of nice features. The RGB is really nice with different modes to cycle through. Buttons are very tactile and offer a solid \"click\". The ability to adjust dpi on the fly is really awesome. There are two buttons for adjusting it up/down on the top and the color change that flashes for couple of seconds determines the dpi setting you are currently using. You can also use the third button on the top of the mouse to adjust the RGB. There is also a rapid fire button next to the left mouse click and a mode switch button at the bottom of the mouse. Lots of great features for such an inexpensive mouse. Smooth, beatiful, and comfortable to use.",

                "reviewText": "It's okay, definitely of better quality than some of the more expensive gaming mice I've purchased in the past. It has a friendly user interface and does the trick. I use it for an at home office setup and enjoy it. There's nothing that really separates it from other mice though, besides a few extra buttons. It's not heavy and doesn't stick. I've had it for about three months with no issues. I did have to tweak the sensitivity after unboxing it, which also wasn't difficult at all. It's okay, not top of the line or the \"best gaming mouse on the planet\". It's simply okay. If you're like me and use gamergear for your at home office then this is definitely the product for you.",

I use it for daily computing and some gaming. Very smooth and responsive. The color modes are neat, too!",

                "reviewTitle": "The Redragon M612 Predator...... A Legendary Creature",
                "reviewText": "I thought the scroll wheel on my mouse gave up. Coincidentally, it was another Redragon SKU, the M601-3 Centrophorus. I began a restless search for a successor, one with improved aesthetics, functionality and a drive for longevity, but not financially gluttonous.I scoured the internet, high and low, side to side, black and white and sometimes upside down and inside out. I researched all sorts of dragons, large and small, red and green and even green and red. I learned a great deal about this mythical creature. But in all honesty, none of them would fit on my desk. I doubt any of them would fin in my house. And if they did, did they evolve with an adequate DPI???The search continued and several prospects from numerous brands emerged, but some seemed over engineered for my needs, others were too dull for my creative spirit, and yet others inadequate in all aspects despite their alluring price points. Many other brands were preposterously priced no matter WHAT the function. I was becoming weary.There must be SOMETHING out there which actually exists outside of an imaginary, mythical, yet artistically prolific realm. My primary electronics purveyor did not possess the mouse that would electrify me. Nor did my primary pet shop......... What??? :|And yet again, Amazon had to entertain my propensity for acquiring appurtenances. And yet again...Amazon delivered. But this isn't an endorsement for Amazon, no. Which is fantastic. And a great resource for random commodity stock, even for a minimalist like myself, who only buys things that are NECESSARY, not over buying, not over spending, just.........Right, the Dragon. Well, I searched Amazon...... ;) ......and was greeted by a deluge of mouse choices... Choices for mice... Choice of mice...... Anyway, some came with tails, some without. I tend to stick to the wired kind because they have been, to date, more reliable and economical (no battery replacements or charging required). I sifted through the digital pile of mice and found this M612 Predator (Great film, by the way. Predator, 1987...The Terminator and Apollo Creed, hunting, or BEING hunted, rather, by a sadistic trophy collecting alien...... *thumbs up*)......Right, the Dragon. So the M612 Predator filled the role I envisioned a mouse would fill. It has, let's see, left click, right click. So far, so good. It has a scroll wheel. Nice touch. It has two more buttons on the left side for gamers (not fifty buttons, but a modest two) so I don't feel overwhelmed as I age, what with dementia and arthritis setting in I wouldn't remember what they all do OR click them if I did. And it has a rapid fire button at the edge of the left click button. Again, a gimmick for gamers but it could double as double click (see what I did ther?) for other applications/programs, giving the left click button some much needed respite.Other than that, it feels great. Much like, what I imagine, a real life dragon would feel like as you caress its scales, which are sensitive to the touch but solidify your grip. It's contours support your palm gently, yet vigorously. It's not very heavy and glides on the mouse pad as if it were airborne, gliding the thermals towards the horizon of online wonders. It feels very responsive regardless of what it's tasked with. Between downtime on War Thunder, or tedious Excel spreadsheet compositions I cannot complain.And lastly, yes......... It breathes fire (RGB). Not too many lighting modes but again, as a minimalist, that's perfectly fine. It looks elegant and ferocious. Ever see a dragon spewing red flames? That's what you'll get with the M612.........if......if you set it to all red lighting...After initial use, I actually purchased a second mouse for my daughter. Not only that, but once my M601 scroll wheel came back to life during use as a laptop mouse (unexpected turn of PC/laptop accesory developments) I set the Predator aside for future use once the M601 does finally succumb to a barrage of vehement clicking. I just don't want to wear and tear it until I'M ready, OK??? But I am pleased to report that my daughter has been using her M612 since July of 2021 without any issues.I highly recommend this mouse. It preforms better than expected and looks and feels great. It also has twice the DPI of the M601 which is more than enough. If only it could cook, I'd be in business.I also highly recommend you watch Predator from 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers.You won't be disappointed with either.",
