                "reviewText": "I like to try out computer mice. I ordered this because my favorite mouse now requires frequent reconnecting, and a mouse with several connection options might be a good replacement or at least help troubleshooting.WHY A MULTI-MODE MOUSE? - It seems the main purpose is to allow switching between 2-3 different devices - using a separate mode for each device. Alternatively, the three modes can provide assurance that you can get the mouse to connect. With my old Bluetooth supporting laptop, neither Bluetooth mode works, but the \"2.4 G\" (USB plug) does.WHAT'S COOL- Attractive: Overall effect is black. But the transparent top reveals a mix of switches and components, plus decorative shapes and intermittent lights that add a \"science fiction\" aesthetic.- Rechargeable: Mouse can be used while charging. (run and recharge times not yet tested)- Three connection modes: Bluetooth 5.0, Bluetooth 3.0, \"2.4 G\" (USB plug)- Ability to switch between three devices. (not tested)- DPI can be switched from the mouse w/o going into settings.BUT ALSO KNOW- The lamp engine is not an \"all surface\" type and may require a mousepad on some surfaces - such as a varnished table top.- The wheel has a \"third button,\" but does not have side switches for horizontal scrolling.- The flat profile fits better in a computer bag, but is less comfortable in my hand that the \"humped\" mice that prevail today.- The battery charge indicator only works when you turn on the power switch - it's a feature not a bug.- CAUTION re. charging: Some sellers of similar models strongly encourage charging ONLY from a computer USB port, and paricularly warn against rapid chargers. Indeed, the specs of this mouse say 4.2 volts, so better not trickle charge, eh? One simple approach: Don't precharge, but use it as wired mouse while it's charging.- Remember that transparent goodies need extra care - because scratches show easily.OTHER- This unit is one of a family of very similar devices with different brand names and different arrays of \"science fiction\" furniture and lamps under the magnet-fitted transparent top - although this unit may be the most attractive and dignified of them all. But the others may have additional features, such as lamps that reveal the current DPI and transmission mode, or a \"boss switch\" (an old term) that immediately opens your computer's desktop.- I am so far clueless about the functional difference between the two bluetooth modes. But when using the mouse with my desktop, my Bluetooth 5.3 plug only works with the mouse's 5.0 mode, whereas my Bluetooth 4.0 plug works with both.",

The mouse is quiet, though not silent. I've used mice that are very quiet with almost inaudible clicks. This one is not silent but it is quiet enough.Issues: not many but a significant issue is in the buttons. When I press and hold the button, sometimes it will trigger a click hold release, and even when I apply enough pressure to keep the button depressed, I notice some inadvertent release. The three DPS options also leave more to be desired. I couldn't find the one that I find most natural. Overall though it is a nice mouse, with the quirks mentioned above.",
