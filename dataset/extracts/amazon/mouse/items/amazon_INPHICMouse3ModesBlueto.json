                "reviewText": "By just about every metric you would use to define a mouse by, this one checks off just about every box. - Ergonomic/comfort - check - it has a sweet spot for size and comfort that rivals more expensive mice. One nit that might affect you depending on the size of your hands is the back button on the side. It was perfect for me, but for bigger hands it might get hit accidentally. - DPI/movement - check - up to 1600 DPI will make just about any creator/gamer happy - Connectivity - check (sorta) - with 2.5 MHz and two Bluetooth options, it's pretty solid and connects every time I've tried, on 2.5 and Bluetooth 5 (haven't tried Bluetooth 4 yet) - Battery life - check-a-roo-check - it's got a rechargeable USB-C port, with battery indicator on top, which is pretty much unheard of in this price category. - build quality is solid and much better than I expected. The mouse-clicks are near silent, which freaked out my gamer son who expected to hear an audible \"click\". Ultimately he concluded he liked the mouse, just wasn't used to any mouse being so quiet.I've been using this non-stop for the last couple of days and I like it a lot. I bought it as a temporary mouse to replace a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed that died on me (and remarkably started working AFTER I bought and received this one).You can see from the comparison pics how similar the size is. For me, this mouse fits better in my hand than the Basilisk. t's not a direct replacement for a mouse like the Basilisk, but for the money it's pretty close. It lacks in one thing most hardcore gamers really need - a decent polling rate. While most gaming mice nowadays poll near 1000, like the Basilisk, this one never got higher than 140.But seriously, unless you're a competitive gamer, you won't notice this. For under $20 US with coupon, you cannot beat this deal.",

Either was a bad inconsistent connectivity, or poor battery life.Not this one. So far 6 months later after I purchased it, it keeps working flawlessly. I can list the things I like the most about it:- Really comfortable and ergonomic. Your hand and fingers rest on it in a comfortable natural way.- Buttons are fast and responsive. So far the buttons still work as intended and have not worn out.-Rechargeable battery. Not only I dont have to replace the battery every few weeks like others. This mouse comes with its own rechargeable battery and using it daily at work, Ive only needed to charge it twice a week and when I do, the battery still shows about 70% charge, so the battery life is amazing and performs beyond my expectations.-Connectivity has been flawless, consistent and fast. I have never had any problems like other mice in which the connection would be lost, or it would take a lot of time for the mice to be discovered. The mouse is ready as soon as the computer boots and loads the operating system.I couldn't recommend this mouse more. Go for it. totally worth it. Excellent mouse",

Confort\u00e1vel de usar, design que encaixa bem na m\u00e3o (gosto de mouse grande), tem as op\u00e7\u00f5es de bot\u00f5es laterais para avan\u00e7ar e retroceder muito \u00fateis em navega\u00e7\u00f5es entre p\u00e1ginas e pastas. O clique dos bot\u00f5es e o Scroll Wheel (bot\u00e3o do meio) s\u00e3o super macios e silenciosos (exceto os laterais citados antes). Mas o destaque positivo para esse mouse \u00e9 a bateria. Deixei carregando cerca de uma hora no primeiro dia e estou usando h\u00e1 15 dias e ainda n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sinais de bateria fraca. Ele desativa automaticamente depois de um tempo de inatividade o que \u00e9 \u00f3timo para economizar bateria. O \u00fanico ponto \"negativo\" \u00e9 que sou acostumado com a luz vermelha em baixo do mouse e ele \u00e9 totalmente apagado, mesmo ligado e funcionando, ainda n\u00e3o acostumei com isso rs.
