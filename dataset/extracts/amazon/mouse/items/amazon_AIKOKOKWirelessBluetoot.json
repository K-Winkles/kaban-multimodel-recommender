                "reviewText": "Amazon to the rescue!My laptop mouse died, but I was able to get this one not only dirt cheap but overnight AND rechargeable.This is my first experience with a rechargeable mouse. So far I like it a lot, in two ways:It's very lightweight and quiet (no clicks when you do the buttons), which is good for use when others are sleeping (my usual pattern of times I'm on the computer).It's rechargeable. Until it eventually dies, I'll not be left stranded due to batteries dying when I'm on the road and don't have replacements in hand.It's got one of the older type interfaces for USB charging which means that I have to bring a specific cable for it; fortunately, there's one other item I usually have with me which uses the same interface, so it's just a data point for me - but might be important to you. I just plug it in when I'm not using it, which means that it's always ready when I DO need it.Another curiosity for me is that when you want to use it after a period of no-use, unlike every previous mouse I've used, moving it around won't wake up the cursor. However, a button-push WILL, and I've become accustomed to doing that to wake it up again.All in all I like it a lot. I don't do fancy stuff with my mouse, so despite all the whizbangs available in some of the other mouse varieties, this does what I need (move the pointer, highlight with a sweep, e.g.) at a nearly free price.",

                "reviewText": "The mouse is lightweight with a matte-like texture. The wireless mode works nicely however when using the Bluetooth functionality while simultaneously using another Bluetooth device, the mouse gets a little glitchy. The USB receiver however works perfectly with fast reactions.RBG lights have limited functionality. Primarily cycles through one contenous color sequence.Charging with the USB cable works well and can be used while connected to the cable.Mouse buttons are silent.overall would recommend it for price.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased because of the low price, although I questioned the lights. Lights are more than subtle, and not in direct view when using. It is responsive and works well from a distance. Battery lasts for a very long time. The 3rd button below the scroller changes the sensitivity which is helpful. Never thought I'd like a mouse like this. It is slim so may be too small for large hands.",

                "reviewText": "Do far there are 2 things that I hate about this mouse1. When you receive this mouse on the bottom of it there is a pointless sticker that tells you something super obvious that needs no instruction . When you try to remove the sticker, it is not easy to remove and leaves tons of sticky residue behind. Who want s the part of the mouse that slides over your table to have sticky residue that picks up all the dust and gross stuff. I absolutely hate products that come with dumb stickers that are really difficult to get off. Absolutely stupid. Seriously, nobody wants a brand new product that is sticky and gross. I don't think the company was trying to be malicious or anything. It's just stupid that companies put stickers in stupid places and use sticker types that don't come off clean.2. They should have made it so you can turn off the lights that are on the mouse and make it look flashy. I understand that some people think it's cool and kids think the lights are cool. Problem is the lights are constantly changing colors and you cannot turn them off. If you were in a work meeting or dark college classroom while a video was playing or something, the lights are distracting and just look unprofessional.Have not had it long but so far the malfunctions just fine. I just think it was a big mistake to have the stupid stickers and to have lights that you can't turn off.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a cheap mouse that would connect to my Fire 10 tablet via Bluetooth. This mouse connected to my tablet easy enough. It is sleek, lightweight and the lights look good. The design is a little awkward in my hand but I have really small hands. My real complaint is that is disconnects frequently from my tablet and I have to flip the switch to reconnect though now I am wondering if it is because the battery is running low. The charge works long enough for what I need to do. For the really cheap price it does what I need until I can get a better one.",
