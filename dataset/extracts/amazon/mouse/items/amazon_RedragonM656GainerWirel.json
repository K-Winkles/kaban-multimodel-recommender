After about 6hr use for 2 days I had to change the battery (which is fine for me after a day of gaming I can just replace battery right away for next time instead of recharging the mouse). The bad, it doesn't connect to the PC if a bit far, maybe 3 feet or so (You may ask, how do I know this? My PC is about 4 ft away so I changed USB placement to the front and it works perfectly, but using front usb ports is lame).",

                "reviewText": "When I first ordered this product, it came in broken. I contacted the company instead of returning it via amazon [ which will take days for money to come in ] and there support was great! Best support I've seen from a company. The mouse coming in broken is a RARE case, so don't think every mouse will come broken.So far, battery, I have been using this mouse for 1 week now, all I put in was 1 battery [ USE ECO MODE ]I use the mouse 7-8h a day on weekends, 3-4h on schooldays. Its great!Next, speed, the speed of the mouse is great! Tho I recommend downloading the software and setting Polling Rate to 500hz and DPI to 1300.Best budget mouse I've had so far, last reddragon mouse I use was wired, it lasted for 6 months, but that wasn't on the company or mouse design, it was on me usually bending wires while playing. I'm gonna update this review when the mouse stops working [ and no I will not forget ]Mouse gotten on August 28thStopped working on: ( mouse didn't stop working yet, gonna update when it has, if it even does )Update: 12/17/2023Mouse randomly stopped working. Tried replacing batteries and leaving the USB Dongle to no evay.I mean hey, it has lasted me a good time. [ From August 28th 2023 ]Gonna see what I can do to boot this mouse back up online",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Download the software for full feature set!",
                "reviewText": "Right off the bat, I wanted to tell you to download the software for this mouse to get its full feature set. If you don't install the software, the mouse will operate with a polling rate of just 125Hz. With the software installed, you can move this up to 500Hz and have a huge benefit to your aim as things will feel much smoother. You can think of this the same way you think of monitor refresh rates, like 60Hz vs 144Hz monitors.---This mouse hits all the high notes for me: wireless functionality, comfortable grip, LED gamer aesthetic lighting--even if it's just basic red, decent DPI, optical sensor instead of laser, easy to swap AA battery instead of frequent charging, and best of all, a price of a measly $20 bill. Overall the mouse feels like decent quality in your hand, so build quality is solid at this price point. I'll add that I did have to pull small pieces of cellophane plastic off of the rubber feet on the mouse. The manual didn't mention these, but it was obvious that the mouse would slide better by pulling the plastic off and letting the actual rubber touch my mouse pad instead. Maybe this was a factory or manual oversight.I decided on this mouse whenever my Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum started having issues staying connected wirelessly and with the left click not always working. I already had experience with Redragon products, as I use their K551 RGB keyboard with blue switches. I used to play competitive games like Counter-Strike at a near professional level about 12 years ago, but since I'm \"retired\" from taking games seriously, I can't really justify spending $80-120 on a new mouse these days.Overall I'm super satisfied with this Redragon M656 \"Gainer\" wireless mouse. It took me very little time to adapt to my new mouse in FPS games like Halo and Valorant. Let's just say for $20, it really fit the bill. Don't forget to download that software to get the full polling rate benefits! Your aim will thank you for it.",
