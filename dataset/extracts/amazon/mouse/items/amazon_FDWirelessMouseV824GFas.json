I was worried that it wouldn't play nice with Chrome OS, but as soon as I plugged the USB in, it immediately started working.ACCURACY- Great! It responds very well and is neither too fast or too slow, and I didn't even have to adjust anything in my settings.NOISE- Great! The click sound is very muffled, which I think I'll find useful when my partner is asleep and I need to do work. If you prefer a more mechanical feel, however, this mouse is not for you.FEEL- This mouse fits my hand very well, even though it's not one of those fancy ergonomic mice. The scroller is more \"clicky\" than smooth.LOOK- It looks great. The white is as white as shown in pictures. It's very simple with no buttons on the side, and I like that.General things I like about it:-The USB fits inside the mouse itself, which is amazing to have compared to other mice that fit theirs in on the bottom. The USB feels more protected this way when it's not in my Chromebook.-IT CAME WITH A BATTERY!!! Gone is the pain of reciving an item and it not having the battery included. The battery was even wrapped so it wasn't wasting power while sitting on the shelf and being shipped.-The packaging was simple and compact. Not nearly as much wasted space as many other items on amazon.Overall, I give this a 5/5! A surprisingly great product for a surprisingly low price.",

                "reviewText": "This mouse isn't like those tiny travel mice that give you cramps in your hand. I had this mouse since September and I was using it every day for school, it's super quiet! I used it at home sometimes if I was feeling lazy instead of using my wired one, so I can say it even works well for gaming and 3D modeling. The battery lasts a really long time, I think I only changed it once or twice within the time I had it. Unfortunately, while backpack, my laptop smashed the scroll wheel into the mouse and I can't get it back out. I'm getting another one now and thought I'd write a review while I'm here! I like that it is low profile because it doesn't jut out in my backpack, it fits very nicely into a pocket. Oh, and it has worked well on every surface I've tried it on.",

However, I had NO IDEA until I did this review that it had sleep mode. Now I'm wondering how do you activate that. Sometimes it does wiggle on my screen a little even when sitting totally still. It may be because it needs to be on a totally flat surface. I do use my laptop when I'm in the bed, so maybe that's it. But overall it works well. I would have liked to see an off button BUT it's still great! I got a black & gold one for my daughter and she loves it too!!",

It comes with a small USB to connect on your computer port, it\u2019s so small that u chat notice it. Sometimes I forget it\u2019s plugged in. Lastly, it\u2019s a good size, I was a bit sketch because i did not want a small mouse, where my hand would completely cover it and it would look weird. I did not have that problem with this mouse, both my boyfriend and I use it and no complaints!",
