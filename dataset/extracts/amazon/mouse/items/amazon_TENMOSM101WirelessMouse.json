                "reviewText": "I loved the ease of the wireless use. I found it comfortable to use. I am a female with a 5'4\" stature so my hands are not large. I love the white background and the light as this is great when using it late at night and most house lights are off for the night. I have dropped this mouse numerous times from the arm of my Lazyboy to my concrete floor. A few times the battery cover has come off. It works as great as it did a year ago. The battery life seemed much longer in the beginning; however, I am now using Amazon and budget batteries and they may not be as good as the one that came with the mouse. Also, since I have dropped it so many times; it tends not to turn off when I have walked away and remains on till I manually turn it off, thus, draining the battery. I believe this to be my carelessness. It use to go off on its own after about 4 minutes which is a good feature if you have a busy life and need to walk away multiple times during a busy day, and or, if you forget to turn it off. When my clumsiness finally kills my mouse, I plan to buy this mouse again. The colors are almost as vivid as pictured, maybe slightly less but very pretty.",
