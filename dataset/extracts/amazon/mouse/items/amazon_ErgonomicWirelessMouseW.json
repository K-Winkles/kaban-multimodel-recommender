Great feel.- Scroll wheel works nicely.- Tracking is fine.- Battery rather than recharge, which I like because all of the recharging ones die within a year- On/Off switch to save your battery- Excellent for smaller hands. I wear women's gloves size S, and this fits my hands really well.Cons:- The click. I have a thing with clicks. It's maddening to hear yourself click loudly all day. If the click were silent, this would be the perfect mouse. Maybe I'm a little neurotic, but it's distracting for me.Neutral:- The LED light near your thumb is small. I don't know why so many of mice have light strips. It seems like something else to use up the battery. I'd prefer to not have any lights, outside of what's necessary underneath for a track light. Not a big deal, and better than most.Other:- Made In China- 6D Optical Mouse- Takes 2 AAA Batteries",

It was spam, and they were not going follow through. Suspect at best BEWARE!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this mouse to use at the office. I loved that it was small for my small hands. A few weeks back, I noticed the cursor randomly timing out and disappearing from my screen. This would happen when the mouse is not in use. I would have to turn the mouse on and off for the cursor to appear on my screen (doing this a few times a day). Annoying, yes, but I was going to put up with it. However, two weeks ago, the scroller broke and is not usable anymore. That was a problem because my job requires me to review numerous pages within a document. I was hoping to return this item but fell a couple of weeks outside the return window. For the price of this mouse, it's not worth buying.",
