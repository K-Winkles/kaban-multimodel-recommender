                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Microsoft Arc Touchmouse",
                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this mouse at major retailer about 2 years ag, primarily because it collapses flat - making it portable and much easier to pack, it works on virtually any surface, and because it is wireless (I hate those pesky wires).the mouse is highly responsive, easy to set up and feels nice under my hand. I never had any problems with it. the transceiver conveniently magnetizes to the underside of the mouse if you need to remove it from your pc.so one fine day, I lost the transceiver. I usually keep it attached to the pc, but I needed the usb port. most of my usb connected equipment will not work on a usb hub and I have not got the time to figure it all out properly, so I just removed the transceiver and stuck it to the mouse. the next thing you know, the transceiver is gone and a search around the house was futile.the next thing to do was a search on the web - which revealed that it is a DEDICATED transceiver and it is not possible to buy just that part. I was mad. a replacement mouse is about 60 dollars at full price. i am not a full price kind of gal. things changed and made me hopeful when I found a replacement here at amazon, i liked that. I like to be frugal. I did not want to break the bank purchasing something that Microsoft should have easily available at a discount.. I chose a particular seller because they had a high rating and their item was the least expensive--being listed as used. used is good as long as it works and is not sticky from snacks gone by.(I want to express how important it is to review your seller and award a high rating if they deserve it! it makes it easier for shoppers to see who they are dealing with.)upon testing the new mouse (it was a newer manufacture than my original) I found it to be in perfect working order. I was pleased. the price was less than half the original smrp and the only reason was that the box was opened. all packaging was original, the included batteries had not even been opened. it was indeed genuine Microsoft. I know, I can tell these things. so, good for me, and good for the seller because he/she got another excellent McRating for politeness and promptness! McYay!just for the heck of it I tried the OLD mouse with the NEW transceiver. alas, it did not work. the old mouse will be useful for some parts if I accidentally step on the new mouse and crush it like I did my new glasses (well, I couldn't SEE them, I wasn't wearing my glasses).I also own a Logitech usb unified remote touchpad and keyboard. I switch off between mice now and then for various reasons, and Logitech has the right idea. even though the touchpad and the keyboard came with their own little transceivers, I only need one transceiver to successfully use BOTH the keyboard and the mouse. Logitech seems to realize that although you can hook up 256 million usb items to your pc, most laptops and pcs have a limited number of usb ports. hubs may work or may not work. I need simplicity with \"it will work\" without having to go to Taiwan to replace the integral part that has no other use. now if Microsoft could please do something about that 'dedicated transceiver' thing (um, do they know about Bluetooth?) then that would make this mouse better than perfect.all that being said, and since i was able to get what i needed from amazon, my final thought is this: my son has a very specialized gaming mouse he paid a lot for. it is very precise. I like a fast precise mouse. this microsoft arc mouse is that and a whole lot more. I do love it.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this item on a whim when I was away from home. I had forgotten to pack a mouse to use with my tablet and decided to look browse online for one of those tiny travel mice. I happened across this item, the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse. The powered off mode when the mouse is bent out flat is perfect for slipping into the small zipper pocket on my tablet sleeve. Mind you, this is the USB version and I have the Surface Pro which has a USB port so it may not work for your tablet but works great with desktops, laptops, my smart TV, and even a game console which supports mice input.Set-up is a breeze. The tiny USB receiver plugs into... a USB port which then immediately is detected. On Windows 7 there was a quick installation but on 8 it was practically instantaneous. After opening the battery hatch and popping in the provided AAA batteries, you're ready to go. The wireless signal was a little weak due to my super thick desk and using a rear port, but using a front port, keyboard port, or even a USB extension cord gave a much stronger connection.As a computer mouse, this is an odd one at first glance. To power it on, you bend the \"tail\" of the mouse downwards until you hear and feel a nice solid and satisfying click. To show you the mouse has been powered on, the blue optical sensor on the bottom lights up along with a green light on the top. The arc (ah-ha, hence the name) gives the mouse the feeling of a typical pointing tool so your muscle memory kicks right in and you'll be pointing and clicking in no time. I was a bit concerned about how the wheel-slide-pad thing would work but finally giving it a try did away with my fears. The wheel (I'll be calling it that from now on) works just a mechanical wheel, slide up and down to scroll. There is a small amount of haptic feedback when scrolling; just like with a mechanical wheel clicking and a cellphone vibrating, you immediately know when the mouse registers a scroll command. You can also give the pad a small flick in either direction to cover more distance quickly but it allows you to then put your finger on the wheel to immediately stop to prevent any runaway scrolling. I also figured out that if you double tap the wheel near the center, it acts like a middle mouse button press which is a very useful function I worried was missing. Using the wheel takes a small amount of time to get used to but after a few hours, I believe I've gotten the hang of it.One could assume the mouse is rather lightweight due to the compact design and the mouse gives quite a bit of resistance from force at the top so as not to fold flat and turn off. I was able to balance a small tub of lotion, a roll of packing tape, a 500mL bottle of water, a remote control and a smallish digital camera on the mouse without it collapsing. Even so, a quick but gentle swat or using leverage at the ends is enough to close it shut without having to use much muscle providing ease of use for when you with to turn your mouse off.Storage is easy due to the flat profile but I am somewhat worried of keeping the USB receiver and mouse together. I was expecting a small hole for the receiver behind the battery hatch like with most other wireless mice I've seen. This mouse has a small picture of the receiver on the bottom showing where a surprisingly strong magnet is hidden where you can store the tiny plug. It's a little strange to have it this way but the magnet seems strong enough to keep it from falling away and getting lost. If you're worried too, keep it in the USB port of your laptop or tablet; the protrusion is practically invisible, almost flush with the side of my laptop, and won't get in the way when storing your computer.Long-story-short/conclusion: Great mouse; travels well, works well, comfortable for gaming and productivity, good for scaring people when you bend it in half to turn it on. I can't comment on the battery life due to it only arriving today but I'm willing to guess the batteries will last as long as in a typical wireless mouse. Also, it works as a blue flash light for when you need to find something in the darkness under your desk.",

                "reviewText": "Compr\u00e9 este mouse en Marzo del 2016 por el simple hecho de que me gust\u00f3 su dise\u00f1o. Es ligero, se adapta bien a mi mano, y funciona bien en casi cualquier superficie. Casi 7 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s sigue funcionando perfectamente. He llegado a comprar otros mouse porque despu\u00e9s de tanto tiempo me ha llegado a aburrir y he querido probar otras marcas/modelos. Esos otros mouse se han descompuesto en el camino y este continua en la batalla. Actualmente es el mouse que utilizo a diario. En definitiva el mejor mouse que he tenido! 10000000% recomendable!En la foto tal vez se puede apreciar ya los a\u00f1os de uso.",
