But it works well and is easy to wake up. It doesn't wake up just with scrolling; you need to right- or left-click it. (I almost sent it back because I thought it didn't work before I figured this out.) And it's not the smoothest roll, but using a mouse pad helps. I love the soft baby pink color. Overall a good purchase for the price.",

It has worked very smoothly so far and as someone who is so picky with how a mouse feels, it has comfortable positioning. Another quick thing to point out is that the clicking has a very subtle/soft noise so it is not loud at all. Overall, I will greatly recommend to buy this mouse if you are looking for something small, smooth and noise free.",

Perfect for our home office, it doesn't disrupt the peaceful atmosphere. Plus, the sleek white design adds a touch of style. My wife absolutely loves how comfortable it is to use. This mouse has truly surpassed our expectations, making navigating through our MacBook a breeze. It's not just a mouse; it's become an essential part of our daily routine.

El bluetooth conecta r\u00e1pido y la MacBook Air lo reconoce sin problema.Atenci\u00f3n a los que les interesa la practicidad: este mouse carga con USB-C por lo que se acabaron los cables especiales para cargar el mouse, usas el cargador del celular sin problema.No me gusta: es muy ligero y parece que no estoy usando el mouse, la rueda de scroll se siente demasiado fr\u00e1gil como que va a dejar de funcionar en menos de un a\u00f1o sin embargo en las primeras pruebas desplaza p\u00e1ginas muy bien, solo falta la sensaci\u00f3n de calidad que este dispositivo, por el precio, no tiene.Game changer: no me di cuenta y viene con un adaptador USB a USC-C, entonces me ha solucionado todo porque se puede usar el USB del mouse y conectarlo con el 2.4Gz (las MacBook Air solo traen USB-C) entonces puedo conectar cualquier otro dispositivo USB regular, pero adem\u00e1s le puedo conectar una memoria USB \u00a1al celular! usando el adaptador incluido.Por el precio no me doler\u00eda perderlo, adem\u00e1s de que lleg\u00f3 relativamente r\u00e1pido; de usar el trackpad a usar este mouse es una gran diferencia y es como un puente entre un mouse diez veces m\u00e1s caro. Volver\u00e9 a comprar, muy buena opci\u00f3n para un electr\u00f3nico econ\u00f3mico.",
