                "reviewText": "So let me start this off by saying that my husband has a problem when it comes to cell phones & touch screens - a problem that involves dropping & breaking them! Not so much to the point where the screen is so cracked it doesn\u2019t work, or you can\u2019t see a thing, but just enough that it has no touch screen properties. I temporarily \u201cfixed\u201d his problem with a pack of usb-c to USB adapters & he\u2019s been able to use a mouse to operate it! (in case you\u2019re wondering, yes, it looks ridiculous - picture a grown man rolling a mouth on his chest or stomach to send a text message\ud83d\ude02). That said, he\u2019s gone through his fair share of computer \u201cmice,\u201d so we\u2019ve always bought cheap ones! These\u2026unfortunately, were a little too cheap. 3 of the mice lasted 1 month each & when it was time to plug the 4th in (still wrapped & in the box) it did not work AT ALL. I even plugged it into my lap top & desktop computers, just to verify & it didn\u2019t work. Sooo we\u2019re back to spending $6-9 on a mouse that will last longer than all 4 (or, well, 3 of these mice).I will say they are super quiet & get an extra star for that!",
