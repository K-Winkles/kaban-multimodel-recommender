I have one in my travel bag, and I have a couple at other haunts that I'm at regularly waiting for me to visit.It's the most comfortable mouse I've ever used - since 1990-someting or other. The wheel works great, I can change the DPI to change how fast the cursor moves, I can use the side buttons to back/forward my web surfing... The battery life is excellent... For the price, I feel like I get every penny of use out of these!Buy it.",

But the logo and design are all exactly the same, even the manual is exactly the same.I have purchased 5 of these mice in the past 5 years. (for use on two separate computers). This new one and one of the older ones still work. I find that they last for about 1-2 years with consistent or heavy use. I used the one I just replaced for gaming and it still lasted 2 years.They all fail the same way. The wheel starts scrolling the page up when it should be going down or visversa. Minor at first then big jumps. Then later the page will start randomly scrolling by itself. It's the wheel of the mouse. The first one that failed I took it apart and fixed it, it worked for another month then it broke again so I just got a new one. They have all failed the same way. So now I know when it starts skipping up instead of down that my mouse is at the beginnings of failing.The other buttons all still work properly but the wheel does not. I use the wheel pretty regularly so for me, when the wheel fails it's time for a new mouse.",

The mouse still worked although the battery had already leaked out and eaten up the circuit board.With the replacement mouse I had a little issue for a moment as it connected to a computer that had my old mouse plugged in. It did not want to connect to the receiver that came with it. At first I thought I had a bad receiver but that was not the case. All I had to do is unplug all the receivers from the other computers so the new receiver could connect to the new mouse. After reinstalling all the other receivers every mouse controlled the PC it was intended to. All is good again in my little PC universe...",

                "reviewText": "I have an abusive relationship with this mouse.I bought my first one several years ago and it was love at first sight. I'd never had a wireless mouse before, and it felt freeing not being attached to my computer. It held my hand through video games, term papers, mundane web browsing...and then one day the scroll wheel started acting up. I'd be scrolling down a webpage and it'd fight me the whole way down, taking one step back for every two steps forward. We went on like this for a few months before I'd had enough. It had gotten so bad that the scroll wheel's only function was to make the screen twitch up and down. I figured I'd gotten a good year or so out of it and for $11 that's not bad, so I left.I started to look back on all our good times together, how well it fit in my hand, how responsive it was, the variable DPI, the thumb buttons. I thought about it a lot and I decided we'd try again, so I ordered another one. It felt like a fresh start. We were getting along great and it was looking like we'd be together forever. After a few months though the middle mouse button started getting lazy. I'd have to press down hard to get it to respond. Just like before, the problem got worse over a few months and it got unbearable. I tried everything I could think of - I took it apart and applied some canned air to the button, I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, but it didn't want to change. We dealt with each other's hostility for a time and I finally decided it was time to part ways.But once again I chose to ignore the bad times and focus on the good. Nostalgia got the better of me and soon enough I broke down and ordered my third mouse. I thought \"this time will be different. I'll treat it extra nice and it'll do what it promised it would\". But it wasn't different. This time it only took 2 months before the scroll wheel problems started. It was the same situation as before - two steps forward, one step back.They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results... but for $11 can you really blame me?",

The 'hand feel' on it is also very good. I highly recommend. I own two of them now and they just keep running and running. Battery seems to last forever. (it's a AA, one battery)",
