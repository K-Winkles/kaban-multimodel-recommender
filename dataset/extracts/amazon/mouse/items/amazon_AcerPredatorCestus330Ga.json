                "reviewText": "I really like this mouse after using it for about 2 months now. The build quality is great and feels really good in the hand due to its shape and thumb rest. It is a wired USB mouse, which I greatly prefer to the wireless ones, and the cord is pretty long, giving you more than enough space to move around. I do recommend using a mousepad, it just gives you a better response.One of the highlights of this mouse is that you can select the color you want for it. The colors you can select are: red, blue, green, cyan, lime green, and pink. The light pulsates slowly too, I don't think there is an option to make the light solid. Please keep in mind that it DOES NOT fade between colors on its own, you have to set the colors yourself on the middle buttons behind the scroll wheel, which is a tiny bit disappointing, but it's still a super cool feature nonetheless!My main form of play is with a controller, although, I have tested this mouse for gaming in a few titles such as Hitman 2, Star Wars The Old Republic, GTA V, & Minecraft. It has surprising response and accuracy considering its price range, I never find it missing a beat where I need the performance most. The side button is great for quick shots since your thumb is readily at the button. The option to weigh it down is also great, I definitely like a heavier mouse, as it felt far too light without the weights.To be honest, my only gripe I have had with the mouse is with the scroll wheel. It's very easy to click on accident, which can sometimes cause it to begin scrolling up or down a page on its own. I'll have to click the page to stop it and readjust to where I was. It doesn't happen all that often because I've gotten used to being more gentle when scrolling, but it is a nuisance sometimes, especially if you're in a hurry. I don't find this being such a problem to deduct any stars though.I would say, if you're looking for a solid quality mouse that feels good, looks good, but more importantly, performs good, you'd probably be happy with it! It won't break your bank and seems like it will hold up well overtime with some care.",

                "reviewText": "Good product. I purchase this product just to match the brand name with my other devices. Compare to Razer mamba brand, it has about the same functions in performance but doesn't have much options with light settings, calibrating, and comforts. It is too expensive in price compare to the Razer Mamba. The mouse itself and grip are made of hard plastic. It doesn't have rubber grip or palm grove support design like the Razer Mamba would have. The click mechanism is little too loud. This product would be perfect to match its price if the clicking mechanism is much more quieter, the material and design for palm support is more comfortably fit, and the settings come with more variety in options.Review edit 7/4/2022Reviews above were base on item function and appearance when first used. After less than 6 months, the item begins to feel very hot under the palm, battery status continue to get low even it is on plug in. The DPI functions were unresponsive and skipping around when it is adjusted. The back lit for the logo light also burnt out. Mouse pointer is malfunction and skipping around the screen while in use, especially during in game. Overall, with this brand name , it is very expensive and the quality is very bad. Base on this result, I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially those who are using for online games.",

Fits both our hands nicely and feels comfortable to hold. Some of the side buttons don\u2019t register for gaming, but the feel of the mouse makes up for it. Nice that you can change the weighting of it, but for us the way it came weighted worked well. You can easily change the speed of the curser as well and that determines the light colour. Overall both very happy with our mouses over our outdated gaming mice.",
