It hold a charge for weeks with no problem. I needed a mouse to operate a complex Editing software Final Cut Pro. And it works flawlessly. It is responsive and operates on any surface. It is comfortable and easy on your hand under long hours of use. The build quality is great and it hooks up immediately on Bluetooth with no problem. I use it both on my Mac Mini M1 and on my IPad 12.9 M2. In summary it\u2019s a great unit, technically perfect and reliable. The price points are great a unit that will last for a long time. For the money you get a lot of Cheese.",

I think i've charged it once since I bought it last semester. I forget to turn it off and it just stays alive. I haven't had any problems with lag or responsiveness based on surface texture. Glass tables, bed sheets, carpets, countertops, desk tops, you name it, this mouse will track across it. To the point where I don't even own a mousepad. Haven't needed one.",

I wanted a simple mouse that was easy to pair and moved smoothly. This mouse did exactly that. Highly recommend for the price. Only wish it had a bit more heft as it feels like it won't last for eternity :) But will report back if it does, which would deserve the 5th star.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Works OK, but there are cons",
                "reviewText": "I bought this mouse primarily because it offers a wireless bluetooth connection and is large enough to let my hand rest on it comfortably (most bluetooth mice seem to be the small 'mobile' variety). In terms of its basic functioning it works well: it makes the bluetooth connection with my Windows 11 computer without any problems, it guides the mouse pointer around as expected, and has left and right click buttons that work just fine. However, there are some significant 'cons' which I list below. If none of them are important to you, this mouse may be what you want.Here are the cons in order of importance:1. Most (all?) bluetooth mice will go to sleep after a certain period of inactivity in order to save on the battery. The Logitech mice I've had will wake up when motion is detected. I consider that to be proper behavior. Unfortunately, this mouse only wakes up when you click one of the buttons. It wouldn't be so bad if it swallowed the click but, instead, it passes the click through to the computer. If the pointer on the screen happens to be hovering over a button or link then it can be a problem. A number of times I've been surprised by something unexpected happening on my computer because of this. It could potentially cause a delete or take you somewhere you don't want to go.2. The mouse is very flat compared to other mice. This may be attractive from an aesthetic point of view, but if you look at other mice you'll see that they generally have a pronounced 'hump'. If you let your hand rest by your side, you'll notice it curves inward; laying it flat on a table is slightly uncomfortable. Since many people often spend considerable time with their hand resting on their mouse, the 'hump' provides better support.3. The mouse has a built-in battery and is rechargeable. That's great. However, the connector on the mouse is non-standard (everything should be Type-C by now). If you lose the cable that comes with it, you may have difficulty finding a replacement.4. The instructions that come with it are not the worst I've seen (by a fair margin), but they're not complete. There is an extra button on the top of the mouse and the instructions say nothing about it. When I looked back on the web page I was able to figure out that the extra button controls the mouse's resolution. Changing it did nothing as far as I could tell. Also, the web page says to charge the mouse as soon as you get it, while the instructions say to use the mouse until the battery runs down, then give it the first charge.Recommendation: Stick with Logitech, Microsoft, other another established company. These hole-in-the-wall companies selling generic products are too much trouble.",

Sure I had to keep adjusting it, disconnecting and re-connecting. Pairing and re-pairing. But no such luck in any that remained functional until I found this mouse. It's a good mouse, there's good accuracy and it's stylish. The best part about it is that it automatically connects without me having to keep re-attaching it like the 3 other mouse I have tried. Thank gosh! I am extremely happy with the price too. I really have no complaints at all other than I wish I bought this before the others. Very Satisfied!",

Unfortunately I work in FCPX (video editing) and the main feature this lacks compared to a real Magic Mouse is the ability so side-scroll horizontally by sliding your finger on the mouse as you can with a Magic Mouse. This mouse you have to find a scroll bar on the bottom of your application or webpage if you need to move horizontally. I imagine for 99% of people who don\u2019t do video editing, not having this feature won\u2019t be issue, so it\u2019s a great for the price, but for video editing i find it quite frustrating not to have so I\u2019ll probably still pony up and buy another Magic Mouse.",

Not sure why but besides that its a ok mouse.- UPDATE -: The seller sent me a new one completely for free. I even managed to find a workaround to the PIN question for Windows 11 but they insisted that I get a new one to avoid reconnecting every now and then. Here is the workaround:-Go on the device in Bluetooth and press \"Forget\" or \"Delete\".-Press on the arrow on your taskbar. Select Bluetooth.-Press \"Join a Personal Area Network\", then add a new device at the top of the screen.-Make sure you press the \"connect\" button under the mouse.-Once you click and it asks for a PIN, just press \"Next\" and it should work just fine.The instructions of the seller were not too clear so I thought I would drop this here. I did all these steps with the charging cable connected just in case. Overall its the best mouse you'll find for this price and its very durable and good. I recommend! Let me know if these steps helped you, I would be glad to help out if they didn't.",
