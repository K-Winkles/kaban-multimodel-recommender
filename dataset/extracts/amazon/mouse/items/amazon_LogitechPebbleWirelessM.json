                "reviewText": "Nice looking, feels good, and it works well. The buttons and scroll wheel are good; the cursor speed is good. Recommended, but there is a small problem, which I believe is not the fault of the mouse.Unfortunately, after a week it lost the Bluetooth connection and would not reconnect until I turned off wi-fi. Then it stayed connected after I turned wi-fi again -- until the next time. This is a known problem with Windows, not the mouse as far as I can tell.Wi-fi, Bluetooth, and I believe Thunderbolt all use the same frequency band. The devices are supposed to negotiate to avoid this conflict, but it doesn't work well on Windows. In the past, I have had a Bluetooth mouse completely and repeatedly fail on Windows 10 with wi-fi, but work perfectly without any problem with Linux running on the same computer. There are also lots of reports of the same problem with other brands of Bluetooth mouse. This time I am running Windows 11. I blame Windows, not the mouse. How much problem you will have is probably unpredictable.My previous Logitech mouse worked beautifully and reliably through years of abuse. It has been dropped many times, without any apparent damage. It did finally fail to turn on, which is why I bought this mouse.",

En cuanto a ergonom\u00eda, lo us\u00e9 junto con un pad con almohadilla y ha sido muy c\u00f3modo, aunque presiento que sin el pad se empeorar\u00eda un poco el uso porque por el tama\u00f1o no se puede descansar la mano sobre el mouse.Los clics realmente son silenciosos, ideal para usarlo en clases presenciales y no hacer mucho ruido. En cuanto a la rueda, su sonido es m\u00e1s parecido al de mouses regulares, aunque su clic s\u00ed es m\u00e1s silencioso.Lo he probado tanto con el toggle como con Bluetooth y no he tenido problemas, al igual que en Windows y Android y funciona perfectamente.Buen mouse, aunque en ocasiones se llega a encontrar por un precio elevado y es ah\u00ed donde no creo que valga tanto la pena, pero por menos de 300mxn lo encuentro como excelente opci\u00f3n :)",
