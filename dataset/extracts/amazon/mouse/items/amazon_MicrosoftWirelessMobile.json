It was contained in a combo of box and plastic bubble and very easy to open. Instructions with diagrams displayed as soon as you open the box and it is true Plug-n-Play. I can see that the packaging was designed with customer focus.It included a battery and the color is exactly as I expected. The design looks so simple that I thought I would be sacrificing comfort for price. But even with this simple design it fits nicely in my hand. Most important is the tracking. It is solid and on target. Although I have only been using it for a short time, I am beyond pleased and will seek out the Microsoft brand in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Great mouse but I noticed that if I am behind a wall it wont work.. But much further line of sight it works. Soooooo.... Why I got this was because the computer was in a different room only separated by a wall and 5 feet away.. But I took the mouse 20 feet away in the same room and it works. This should have worked unlike a infrared type transmitter.. The mouse is almost full size but not quiet which is not a problem for my small hands but would be for the average male hands. Since I have not used it long enough I dont know the battery life and it uses a single 1.5V AA battery. It is not heavy and feels like a normal standard wired mouse most of the time. I was worried about it working on a slow laptop, as when busy the mouse lock would miss but here it still seems to stay stuck when dragging windows and such. Works as well as a wired mouse but not for what I wanted. I will see if I can convert it to a USB mouse.. Since I like the shape and handling..",

It doesn't get much better.It's got everything you could want in a standard mouse and it even comes with a battery separate from the mouse so you put it in yourself. The USB transmitter also has a place in the battery compartment for storage. The buttons have a very nice feel to them a soft click but not too soft. Especially when you consider the price, I would buy this again if I ever needed another standard mouse.",

I turned on my laptop on the bed and used it on the sheet and it worked just fine. The color is nice, the scrolling wheel works well, and it has a nice click (kind of on the loud side). I needed a better wireless mouse after an older cheap one died, and this was a great purchase!",

It never broke, never failed me, and I remember changing the batteries only 3~4 times although I used it everyday. I just wanted to buy another one in a different color, so I bought this and I like it. It's equally good and comfortable to use. I also like how it fits my hand very well, but I think I should also mention the fact that my hand is quite small. (My hand slightly covers an iphone6s.) I would recommend this if you have small hands like me or if you like to have a compact wireless mouse.",
