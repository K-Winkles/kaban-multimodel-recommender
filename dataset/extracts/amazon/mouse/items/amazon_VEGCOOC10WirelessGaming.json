And the USB receiver can help the computer identify and connect the mouse. So when using the mouse, you need to plug the USB receiver into the USB port of the computer. 2. The USB receiver is under the mouse, please remove the USB receiver from USB slot with your fingernails. If there is no USB receiver, please feel free to contact VEGCOO. 3. Please charge the mouse for about 2 hours before first time use it. 4. When you do not use it over 8 minutes, the mouse will enter into sleeping mode, you can click any button to wake it up. 5. It's out of power if the mouse cursor moves slowly or stop moving. 6. The blue light beside the scroll wheel will be on while charging, and then goes off when the mouse is fully charged.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing price for such a superb mouse. It's very comfortable (especially if you have long fingers like me because it has a longer build compared to some other mice) and has decent cursor sensitivity for gaming. All the buttons and the scroller work well and efficiently. The mouse was less bright than I anticipated, but the lights still shifted smoothly through the colors. I thought a nice feature was that you could have the lights on or off, if you want to save power but still keep the mouse on.The one thing that seemed to be a consistent problem was that after about a year, it refused to charge properly for me. It kept spitting the charger out and it would take a long time since you had to force it back in after a little while.Other than that, I faced no problems with this mouse. Would definitely buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently won a color lit keyboard and decided to try and find a mouse to match. I bought this for work in an office and love the fact that it\u2019s wireless as my mouse sits too far for a wired version to reach the back of the PC tower. Setup was very easy and it connected right away to the Windows 10 PC I use at work. The colors fade in and out nicely as shown in the video and are vida le even when in daylight. You can still use it while it\u2019s being charged, it\u2019s just slightly inconvenient for me because I have to run the cable down the front of my desk to the front of the tower, but I knew that when I bought it. The charge lasts for about one week as I end up charging it on Monday or Tuesday most weeks. It is very comfortable to hold, but do be careful of the buttons on the side as they click very easily and one functions as a \u201cback\u201d key, so I lost something I was keying in online when I hit it with the inside of my thumb when trying to move the mouse. The nice thing is how silent it really is! The scroll is super quiet and you virtually can not hear the finger clicks. Overall I love this mouse and actually purchased another to gift one to my brother, who is a gamer and also liked it very much.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Good size for my smallish hands, fairly comfortable to hold. Light weight could be a pro or con depending on your personal preferences. Charges pretty quickly with any micro USB cable you have in your junk drawer. Battery life has been great - I use it several hours a day and only have to charge it every week or two. Scroll wheel and clicks have a nice feel to them and are actually much quieter than my previous, more expensive \"silent\" mouse! CPI options are fine for the average user. It's been dropped many times in the 7 months that I've had it, and came out unscathed. Overall it's been serving me well.Cons: The build quality isn't exactly impressive and there are some rough edges to the plastic around the scroll wheel. And mine might just be defective, but the \"breathing\" lights are not properly synchronized and will eventually become a muddled mess of colors. It looks kind of cool that way IMO but may bother others. Also, if left alone for too long, it goes into sort of a half sleep mode where it's super slow and laggy and you have to switch it off and back on to restore normal function.Overall: Not much to complain about. It's a pretty cool little mouse and I love not having to buy batteries anymore. If you can get it for less than $15 then go for it.",

It feels of a decent weight but is nice and lightweight. The usb dongle storage at the bottom makes it easy to put in my backpack and take to class. The lights are cool but the green and yellow colors don\u2019t show up as well. After a period of inactivity it will turn off on its own which is nice but I find myself having to switch it off and back on when I come back to it. These little things hardly impeded on the rating since the product does what it said it would and was cheap for what you get. Good for productivity in style. Not a gamer but I would say it\u2019s good for that but maybe not the best. I would spend a little extra money for a nice gaming mouse with more dpi settings. I really like the mouse overall and recommend you try it as it won\u2019t hurt your budget.",

I always use a monitor with my Mac so I have something connected to it for it to work. I plug the usb in that so I can use it. The only time the mouse glitches a little (it turns off for a slight moment then comes back on) is when I have a lot of windows and tabs open either while working or gaming. The battery life lasts so long I\u2019ve only gad to charge it once since I\u2019ve gotten it. So overall great mouse the lights are really pretty and so very useful!",
