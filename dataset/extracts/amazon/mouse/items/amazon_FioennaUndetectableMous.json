If you really just want your computer to stay awake (not go into the sleep mode), then go to your settings and take off the function that makes your computer go to sleep after a period of inactivity.There maybe some counter arguement that office computers will not allow you change a lot of the computer settings especially the timeouts of the computer. This is done for security purpose so that your computer will automatically lock when you are away from your computer and sensitive company information are kept confidential. Putting this device will certainly circumvent your security protocols but may get you in trouble with your company.I would not recommend buying this device but I still gave it the 4 stars because the manufacturer was very upfront with what the product is suppose to deliver and it delivered.",
