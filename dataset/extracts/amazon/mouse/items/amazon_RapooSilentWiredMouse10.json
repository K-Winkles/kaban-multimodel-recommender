                "reviewText": "This mouse works great. It's very responsive. It's a nice size for a hand - not an overly big, full sized mouse but more of a compact size. I'm giving it a 5 star review because it is a good mouse for someone who is looking for a mouse that is as lightweight as air. It's so lightweight, it's lighter than a piece of paper. It's also silent. You can barely hear or feel the clicking. Overall, this mouse is not for me and I'm returning it. I like a mouse with more weight and definitely loud clicking noise.",

But it's thoroughly Mac-compatible.After my Mac Mini failed and I bought a new one with an M1 chip and the latest OS, I had problems with every mouse I had. Either it would stop working when I woke the Mac from sleep (and I had to unplug it and plug it in again), or scrolling with the scroll wheel was totally wrong, or\u2014the only mouse that didn't have these problems, the Logitech B100\u2014it was black, and I want a white mouse. This one, the Rapoo M100, met all my conditions.The only problem I've had with it is that on my favorite mouse pad, which is mostly black with closely spaced white lines in various directions (it's a montage of zebras), it sometimes doesn't respond to small movements. It works well on a half-sheet of white paper\u2014I'm getting a new mouse pad. Works best with solid color pad.",

The scrolling wheel has little indentations across, so it's easy to scroll with a index finger.The only thing that it does not have a protective sleeve at the point where the cable gets outs, that the point where the cable got broke on my previous mouse, since it gets bent a lot at that point.I will see how long it last. It's a pity that you can't leave a review several years after you bought a product, since only over the time the quality products show off. It's is not the features that matter, a lot of cheap Chinese products have them, it is how they work over time. The features do not matter if the thing is broken.",
