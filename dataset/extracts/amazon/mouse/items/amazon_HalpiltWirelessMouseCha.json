This one has been great.This is working in a MacBook Air, I am new to the Mac and have been using a PC mouse for right at 30 years. It is kind of hard for this old dog to learn new tricks.Slides across the desk or mouse pad nicely. Seems accurate in the movement on screen. Scrolls smoothily too. I am a trying to figure out the battery life; after leaving it on for a couple of days without use it wouldn't work I had to move the dongle to the other USB port to get it to respond. Maybe since the battery on the Mac was really low it suspended that port or something.I have dropped it on a hard wood floor once and it has survived.",

                "reviewText": "This is the lightest mouse in history. It has rechargeable batteries built into the mouse (not removable) and a red light to indicate it is charging. My ONLY criticism is that there is no indicator when the battery is low - it just stops working. I get about 7 to 10 days of constant use off each charge. I am assuming that duration will lessen as time goes by, but it's worth the price.",

I'm ready to retire my Micro USB cords, but this is keeping them in the mix. :(",
