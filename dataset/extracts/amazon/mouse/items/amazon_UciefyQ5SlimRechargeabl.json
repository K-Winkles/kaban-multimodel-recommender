                "reviewText": "UPDATE #2 (written July 2023):Still using it daily, and she\u2019s still going strong. Zero issues whatsoever. Safe to say this mouse was a solid purchase and will probably outlive me. Next update will be in the year 2030. See ya then!___________________________________________UPDATE #1 (written August-ish 2022):I still use this mouse over two years later, and it still looks and works like new. It was a great purchase!___________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm sure I'm not the only one who does this, but before I make any purchase, no matter if it's a three-dollar item or a 1000-dollar item, I read through all the reviews and compare and contrast my options. I mean, we all want the best bang for our buck.Anyway, the other day when I was shopping for a mouse for my new MacBook, I was overwhelmed by all the choices on here. I was also not very impressed by the subpar reviews that most of the mice had. Eventually my search led me to this mouse, and I'm super glad I found it.Pros:1) Rechargeable. It has a cord to connect via USB, so you can use it while it charges.2) Bluetooth capable. You can ditch the cord when the mouse is charged.3) Ergonomic. Slim, lightweight, and super comfortable in your hand.4) Easy. Took me two seconds to connect it to my MacBook.5) Sturdy. I've already dropped it on the floor twice, and it works (and looks) like new.6) On/Off switch. You can conserve battery when you're not using it.7) Stylish. I got the rose gold mouse, and it's beautiful and true to color.8) Inexpensive. This mouse is cheaper than most others on Amazon.Cons:I haven't found one yet, but rest assured that I will update this review if I ever do.Conclusion:Would purchase again!",

                "reviewText": "I chose this mouse because it was pink and slender. The color is a matte pink, nice gloss, sleek and smooth. And it is much more than what I expected. The biggest surprise is that it is super quiet and extremely soft to the touch. It glides across the mouse pad. The response is excellent, no jet lag. If your computer goes into sleep mode, you will need to wake the mouse up as well (just click anywhere on the screen). It charges fairly quickly can't give a real time, sorry. The battery life lasts for a long time from 1 full charge. My mouse so far has lasted for 2 weeks at 8 hours a day and is still going on 1 full charge. The blue light comes on when charging, goes out when done. I work my mouse with the left hand, though I am right-handed; so, lefties this mouse feels good for you too. Bottom line: This is a superb item for such a reasonable price.My updated review:I bought this mouse on 12/7/20. I fully charged the battery. It is 12/29/20 and the battery has finally started to die. What happens is the mouse will not be responsive as it did before (won't move where you want it to). That's how you know it is time to charge it. Also, there is a clear piece of film on the back side of the mouse, at the top, shaped in a half oval. It started to peel causing the mouse not to glide smoothly on my mouse pad. Pull it off and you will be fine. I am still loving this mouse!",

                "reviewText": "I'm always a little skeptical about off brand electronics - so far, so good! It promises the small, sleek design with quiet click. Check! I got the rose gold and got exactly what was advertised. It\u2019s absolutely symmetrical so left or right handed users are good to go. Small detail to make note of: I liked the inclusion of both USB C Type and standard USB as we use both. With onboard rechargeable batteries, plug and charge saves the disappointment of a dead battery that has to be replaced. When you are fully charged and ready to go, make sure you add the USB standard wireless \"key\" to the end of the USB C \"key\" (see photo) in order for it to work. Hopefully that will save you some frustration out of the box.",

It doesn't light up or anything to tell you it's dead tho, it just stops working but that's ok. I would recommend this mouse and will buy it again when or if it ever dies.",

After unpacking and charging for the first time, the power lasted over 3 months. Unfortunately after all subsequent recharges the power only lasts about 3 weeks. You can use it with the USB cable attached while it recharges but the port on the mouse is very inconveniently at the top or \"head\" of the mouse. It would be less of a problem if I could plug it for recharging overnight but that is specifically not recommended. I will be checking out other mice that recharge via USB but will probably return to a battery powered type.",
