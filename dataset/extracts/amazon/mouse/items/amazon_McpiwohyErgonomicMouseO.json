It lasted for about a month of not even daily use. Now it works for about 15 minutes on a full charge before it just stops. No warning or anything. Just quits working because it has no more juice left.",

However on 12/20, about four months after I purchased this mouse, it stopped working, with no warning, no notice that it needed to charge, anything. I plugged it in immediately, and despite blinking lights suggesting the charge is working, after charging overnight, there is no sign of life. It appears unable to hold a charge.

                "reviewText": "I have been using a traditional mouse for years and always experienced wrist pain and poor blood circulation to my right hand after long hours at the computer. I decided to give this Optical Vertical Mouse a try, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.First of all, the ergonomic design is a game changer. It took me a couple of days to get used to the vertical orientation, but once I did, my wrist pain was virtually eliminated. The mouse's natural handshake position truly provides comfort during extended use and reduces strain on my wrist.The rechargeable feature is another huge plus. I've been using this mouse for about 2 weeks now and haven't had to recharge it yet. We'll see how much longer it lasts, but 2 weeks is pretty impressive already.The build quality feels solid, and the materials used give it a premium feel. The mouse is also relatively lightweight, which helps reduce fatigue during long sessions.In conclusion, this Optical Vertical Mouse has been a fantastic addition to my work setup. It's comfortable, rechargeable, and performs well across a range of tasks. If you're experiencing wrist pain or simply looking for a more ergonomic mouse, I highly recommend giving this one a try. Your wrist will thank you!",

                "reviewText": "Got this mouse for the ergonomic design to address carpal tunnel issues for moderate office work. It worked fine for a few months with roughly 20 hours a week of office productivity use. I haven't had to charge it since the initial charge.Suddenly, the other day, it just stopped working. I plugged it in, which began charging the mouse and allowed me to use it as a wired device. After charging for four to five hours, the mouse will still not work without being plugged in. Tried resyncing it and switching power on and off. It appears the battery just died.The only cons other than the battery dying are that it has a proprietary USB A adapter (USB C would have been nice) and the charging port is an older style micro-USB port (again, not USB C).I guess I wasn't expecting much for a $13 mouse, but it clearly wasn't designed to last very long.",

Just plug in the usb connector that sits inthe bottom of the mouse and nothing else to do but Turn It On!! so easyUPDATE: after one month usage I needed to charge the battery. Not a problem except it charged for 16 hours and then I needed to charge it again after 4 hours of use.I am beyond the return cutoff. I will keep this handy as a spare until the new Logitech is rec'd",

I'm using the original charging cord and plugged into the computer as instructed and device appears green as if charged, yet won't work. Most frustrating about this is I'm outside the return window and I can't find a way to get a hold of the manufacture at all. Will pay the extra for a more reputable brand.",

I plugged it in for 24 hours just in case then unplugged it and it died immediately. It is now a wired mouse and it won't work without being plugged in. I don't know what happened but I am annoyed. I will use the mouse for now but will look else where for a new one.Edit:Due to the excellent customer service I received and getting a replacement I will be adjusting my review. However, this did not resolve my issue the replacement also did not work whenever you unplugged it. At this point I'm thinking it's my bad luck but I'm not going to penalize the company for it since they were so prompt with assisting me with this problem.As a Wired Mouse it works fine. It's silent and comfortable to hold",
