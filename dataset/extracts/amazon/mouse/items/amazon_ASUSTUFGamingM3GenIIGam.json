                "reviewText": "I was so excited to see this available after mostly enjoying my first gen M3, but not really using it all that often because of the sensor. The shape was great and so was the build quality, but the sensor had very odd DPI steps and required the bloated Asus Armoury software to change them. It was also a little bit heavier than my preference. The M3 Gen II came out and has a slightly better sensor with better DPI steps, and is also quite a bit lighter. I took the mouse out of the box and tried out the clicks, and was incredibly disappointed. The left click is fairly stiff and requires a lot of pressure, but the right click has so much pre-travel and requires so much force that it is almost unusable. The older M3 had great clicks that were easy to use... what happened? While shape is king, the clicks are so hard to press that my hand was getting tired after a short period of time. I may have just lost the QC lottery, but I feel so let down because everything else about the mouse is fantastic. Sadly, I will be returning it and your mileage may vary.",
