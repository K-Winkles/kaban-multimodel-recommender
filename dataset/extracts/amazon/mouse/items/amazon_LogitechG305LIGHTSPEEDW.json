                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in its striking white variant, and I must say it's an absolute gem. This mouse deserves every bit of its 5-star rating for several compelling reasons, though it's not without a few minor quibbles.Pros:1. Speedy Wireless Connectivity: The Logitech G305's wireless performance is impressive, offering responsiveness that rivals wired mice. It's perfect for fast-paced gaming, and I haven't experienced any noticeable lag. However, its wireless range could be improved, so be mindful of that.2. Sharp and Tactile Clicks: The mouse clicks are a standout feature for me. They're sharp, tactile, and provide a satisfying feedback that's crucial for precision in gaming. It's a pleasure to use for both gaming and everyday tasks.3. Comfortable Ergonomics: The G305's ergonomic design suits a claw grip style, which I personally prefer. It fits comfortably in hand, allowing for long gaming sessions without discomfort.4. Lightning-Fast Sensor: The sensor speed on this mouse is fantastic. It's incredibly accurate and responsive, ensuring your every movement is translated flawlessly on-screen. This is a significant advantage for gamers who demand precision.5. Good Battery Life: While it's not the best among wireless mice with swappable batteries, the G305's battery life is still respectable. It keeps you gaming for hours before needing a battery change.Cons:1. Non-Rechargeable: One notable drawback is that the G305 relies on swappable batteries instead of being rechargeable. While this allows for uninterrupted gaming by swapping batteries, it can be a hassle to source and replace them.2. Limited Software Customization: The Logitech G-Hub software, while functional, leaves something to be desired in terms of customization options. I wish it offered more advanced features to truly unlock the mouse's potential.3. Easily Pressed Side Buttons: The side buttons, while of good quality, are somewhat prone to accidental presses due to their placement. This may be a minor inconvenience for some users.4. Prone to Dirt: The white variant of the G305 is a stunner, but it does attract dirt and smudges relatively easily. Regular cleaning is needed to keep it looking pristine.Overall, at a price point of $35, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in white is an exceptional buy. Its swift wireless connectivity, tactile clicks, comfortable design for claw grip users, and blazing sensor speed make it a top-notch gaming mouse. While rechargeability and more comprehensive software features would be nice additions, they don't detract significantly from the overall value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly yet high-performance gaming mouse, the G305 is an excellent choice that won't disappoint.",

                "reviewText": "I game a lot, specifically Valorant where aim is incredibly important. I used to have this $9 mouse that I gamed with and I thought for the longest time that my aim was just because I was bad at the game. But once I realized that maybe it wasn't and got this mouse, my gaming life changed. This mouse is so good, the reactivity and responsiveness of it is super nice. There are other gaming mice out there for like $100 but get this one because it's half the price and just as good. You can change the DPI right on the mouse on the top button and there are 4 options. It runs so smoothly it's so beautiful every time I get headtaps in my game. The battery life of it is also really good. I've had the same battery in it for like 3 months and it works just fine. It goes to sleep and then when you shake it, it comes to life. The material itself is nice, it's smooth and the grip is good. There's also buttons on the left side you can use. I'm so glad I got this mouse because now I don't have to curse myself for being trash at games when I'm actually not.",

It no longer connects to the bluetooth. I'm not even sure if it turns on anymore.

It works great for wrist aiming and it feels just as responsive as a wired mouse. I cannot go back to wired mice after using this. The battery life is very good, this mouse is not wasting juice on useless lights or other cosmetic features. Its a great cheap wireless mouse that you can use for gaming.
