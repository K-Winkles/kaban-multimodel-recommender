I use Bluetooth and it connected right away to my gaming/work laptop. The only con here is that one of the buttons is designed/unable to operate on Bluetooth.Mouse charges quickly as well with a provided USB-A to USB-C cable.Overall a great mouse for a great price",

                "reviewText": "ive had this mouse for a month now, and its very good! i like the smooth feeling it has and how it feels in my hand(i have small hands). im able to customize the side buttons to copy and paste which is so convenient for my WFH job because i do it so much. fully customizable RGB solid colors as well as customizable dpi options. i had an issue with getting the driver installed, but i contacted support and the seller sent me a direct link for the download and it worked! clicking sound is on the louder side but if you have noise canceling of any sort it shouldnt pick up on mics. when i got the mouse i used the batteries for my old mouse and a 40% battery(shows on the driver) lasted me until yesterday, which it was at 20% when it begun to blink red to indicate the battery was dying. just turn off the mouse when not using it. has macro but im too lazy to figure it out and i dont need it. this was the only wireless mouse i could find that has RGB and takes batteries instead of being rechargable while being at an affordable price. can safely say i reccomend this!",

                "reviewText": "Sadly, after later use, I am not thrilled with battery life... on a full, overnight charge, it provides just a few hours of battery life before it starts flashing Red, and an hour after that (of gaming) and it is dead. Fortunately, I can run a USB cable to it, in a way that doesn't interfere with use, but basically that gives me a wired mouse. Maybe that is why T-Dagger's actual mouse is simply wired.Also, it needs quite a few hours (basically overnight) to get back to full charge.So generally, this is an excellent mouse to use, but it really is a wired mouse, most of the time.So I'm dropping my review to 4 starts.Original review:I'm using Windows 10 Pro, and was looking for several key characteristics:1. large mouse (preferably about 5\" long) for my large hands2. long battery life between charges, and internal battery if possible3. comfortable, curved, ergonomic design4. works reliably in games, on my new large mouse pad (only one mouse has failed that test).This mouse fits all the requirements, and is a joy to use!! I don't yet know how battery life is going to play out, but otherwise it is just perfect. And I love the flowing color scheme, though usually I don't really care about LED patterns on my computer equipment.An interesting note about this device, is that it claims to be made by RysoPhy, that T symbol is actually the symbol for a peripheral company named T-Dagger... and when I look on the T-Dagger sight, I see a mouse that is identical to this, except that it is wired only... apparently the wifi/bluetooth design was customized for RysoPhy... doesn't matter to me, except that I've used T-Dagger mice before and they've always been reliable, so that is reassuring...This one is definitely a keeper!!",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse to use with my laptop for work and online classes. I am picky about mice, but I'm also cheap. I game with a Redragon wired MMO mouse on my desktop PC and the mouse is super comfortable and I liked the finger rests. I wanted a wireless version but I'm cheap and broke so I found this mouse here and it's been pretty good. Very comfortable, adjustable dpi which is nice, and has decent response. I haven't tried playing anything like a FPS with it yet, but it was responsive enough for Diablo Immortal. Battery life if really good. Being rechargeable is also nice so I'm not wasting money on batteries.Summary:*It's comfy*Decent response*Rechargeable*Inexpensive",

Download the program to modify your settings! You're able to select specific DPI levels from a pretty good range and change the lightning effects of the rgb effect. I highly recommend this if you have bigger hands, which is why I love this. Mice are usually small and feel like I'm holding an old flip phone, but I love the bulkiness of this mouse. Side buttons work flawlessly, and after a few months I've yet to have any fading. I've also used this to connect to my smart tv, and it makes web browsing on it a whole lot smoother. Don't even hesitate to get this.",

M1 and M2 have a smoother sandpaper feel to it, which helps with sweat and grease. The side buttons and thumb button also work great. You can find a software for this mouse online and adjust its DPI and such. There is no room in the mouse to store the receiver, which is a minor issue, but for $11 I cannot complain. The RGB activates when idle, and there are different lighting modes. When in use, it deactivates. In summary, if you need a cheap gaming mouse, BUY THIS!5/5. No regrets at all.",

This one fits perfectly. The only con is the Bluetooth range, on the table it is good but the moment I put it away, I can see the lag. It solves my purpose as I always use mouse next to my pc and laptop but might be an issue for those who wants to use mouse at a distance.",

Diese Maus hat nicht nur ein beeindruckendes Design, sondern auch leistungsstarke Eigenschaften, die das Spielerlebnis auf die n\u00e4chste Stufe heben.Die drei verschiedenen Konnektivit\u00e4tsmodi (2,4-G-Modus, Bluetooth-Modus und USB-C) machen diese Maus \u00e4u\u00dferst vielseitig und erm\u00f6glichen eine bequeme Verbindung mit verschiedenen Ger\u00e4ten. Der 2,4-G-Modus eignet sich besonders gut f\u00fcr Spiele, w\u00e4hrend der Bluetooth-Modus die Kabel reduziert und die Akkulaufzeit verl\u00e4ngert. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, drei Ger\u00e4te gleichzeitig anzuschlie\u00dfen, ist besonders praktisch f\u00fcr diejenigen, die mehrere Ger\u00e4te verwenden.Die RGB-Hintergrundbeleuchtung ist atemberaubend und bietet eine Vielzahl von Farboptionen und Effekten. Die Anpassungsm\u00f6glichkeiten \u00fcber die mitgelieferte Software erm\u00f6glichen es, die Beleuchtung genau nach den eigenen Vorlieben anzupassen. Die Option, die Beleuchtung mit einem Schalter unter der Maus auszuschalten, ist ebenfalls ein nettes Feature f\u00fcr Zeiten, in denen man die Beleuchtung nicht ben\u00f6tigt.Die Verfolgungsgenauigkeit auf Pixelebene mit 6-stufiger DPI und 20-G-Beschleunigung sorgt f\u00fcr ein pr\u00e4zises und reaktionsschnelles Spielerlebnis. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, die DPI je nach Bedarf anzupassen, macht diese Maus auch f\u00fcr den B\u00fcroeinsatz geeignet.Die 8 programmierbaren Tasten und die schnelle Feuertaste bieten zus\u00e4tzliche Flexibilit\u00e4t und Anpassungsm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr verschiedene Spiele. Die ergonomische Gestaltung der Maus ist besonders angenehm, vor allem f\u00fcr mittelgro\u00dfe H\u00e4nde. Die matte Textur ist schwei\u00dffest und rutschfest, was den Komfort w\u00e4hrend langer Gaming-Sessions erh\u00f6ht.Die 100% Geld-zur\u00fcck-Garantie und die 3-j\u00e4hrige Garantie zeigen das Vertrauen des Herstellers in die Qualit\u00e4t der Maus. Insgesamt bin ich \u00e4u\u00dferst zufrieden mit der RisoPhy Gaming Maus und empfehle sie jedem, der auf der Suche nach einer hochwertigen, funktionsreichen und stylischen Gaming-Maus ist",
