                "reviewText": "I bought this mouse as an upgrade when my original Razer Deathadder started malfunctioning, and It was definitely worth the price. The mouse is extremely responsive for a wireless mouse, being just as fast as a wired one. It has a Bluetooth mode, and a separate mode to connect to the USB receptor, meaning it can theoretically still be used even if the receptor is lost. It has a small rainbow LED light inside of it, which causes the logo to light up and change colors. It's made of a mix of high quality plastic and rubber grips, which gives it an amazing, quality feel in the hand.Additionally, I find that the mouse is extremely responsive, even on a variety of unorthodox surfaces, such as carpet, blanket, and more.Contrary to some reviews, it does come with a charger! The charger is specifically fitted for the mouse, with the end sliding seamlessly into the base. The mouse can be used while charging, not needing to be unplugged while in use. The other side ends in USB, so It can be plugged directly into the computer.The battery life will last you a while. I haven't had it die on me during use, but I usually use it plugged in, only unplugging it when I need to use my laptop somewhere other than my desk. Still, one could leave the mouse charging overnight and use it unwired throughout the day without issue.",

This makes the mouse perfect for gamers who need pinpoint accuracy and precision.Battery life is another area where the DeathAdder V2 Pro shines. The mouse can last up to 70 hours on a single charge, which is more than enough for even the longest gaming sessions. The mouse is also incredibly lightweight, weighing in at just 88 grams, making it easy to maneuver and reducing fatigue during long gaming sessions.Overall, the Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is a top-of-the-line product that offers exceptional performance and convenience for gamers of all levels.

                "reviewText": "I've been using this mouse for about a year and a half, and it's definitely a nice upgrade over a standard wired DeathAdder. I don't notice any additional latency from the wireless connection, the battery life is great, and it's great not having to worry about a cable interfering with your movements. I bought the charging dock with mine to make charging a little more convenient, and while it sometimes doesn't detect the mouse correctly, it's worth getting.The only downside to this mouse is that the rubber grips on either side are already showing fairly significant signs of wear. My previous wired DeathAdder showed no such wear on it's rubber grips after almost five years of use. It's a shame, as there's no way to replace the grips on this model since they're molded to the mouse body. This doesn't make the mouse unusable, but it does feel sticky on the worn out spots.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying this mouse is a total game-changer for me. As a total FPS addict, I've been through countless mice, but this Razer thing takes the cake (or should I say, clutches the win?).The accuracy is insane. The 20K DPI sensor feels like it reads my mind, letting me whip around corners and land headshots with pixel-perfect precision. And don't even get me started on the speed. It's like this mouse is wirelessly linked to my neurons \u2013 zero lag, just pure, responsive action.Speaking of wireless, the battery life is a beast. I've been using it for weeks on a single charge, no joke. No more mid-clutch battery panics, just hours of uninterrupted gaming glory. Plus, the programmable buttons are a godsend for macros and binds \u2013 I've got everything I need right at my fingertips.If you're serious about FPS games, do yourself a favor and snag one of these. It's an investment, but trust me, it's worth every penny. You'll be dominating the leaderboards in no time.",

Buttons aren't overly loud and are satisfying to press. Performance is more than adequate. Battery life is decent.I use this mouse for accounting and design work. It replaced a Logitech G305 and a ROCCAT LEADR, which were both heavier units. The ROCCAT was a better-looking and more sturdy unit, but it was too heavy and big for many continuous hours of use, and also much more costly.Only complaint about this Razer mouse is it's still pricey for a mouse, and the design is quite boring - nonetheless, I didn't buy it to look at.",

Which is a big disappointment when I need to work on gaming, coding & artwork for long sessions.Sometimes the mouse will need to be recharged 2 hours after unplugging it, I have even left the mouse plugged in for long durations & it still don't make a difference. I don't mean to sound like I am bashing this expensive product, but I am reviewing my experience with this Razor. I had very high expectations, youtubers have said this mouse should never retain any problems until you've had it for 3+ years. But that's not the case with mine.\u2010----------*This has been making a massive improvement on comfort & amount of work I can do without having to worry about triple-A powered or wired mouse products I have owned before.*Being able to switch DPi quickly while I am on various FPS & Simulation games is a much smoother than a previous brand I bought last year. Also the adjustment buttons are in a nice spot, better than having them where the thumb rests.*The battery life seems to have got an estimate of 60+ hours of simulation gaming before I thought about recharging*If you temporarily don't have a mousepad & need to get a new one, the mouse has been working very well on a folded cotton bedsheet (Not polyester, that'll be disaster). I had to do this when I lost a lot of belongings while moving.*The seemingly proprietary has a solid, sturdy feel to it, I like how it has a snug fit & doesn't jangle around.*My neighbor owns two of these Razer Deathadder V2 Pros, so I finally decided to invest in one & I love this product. There's no intense distracting flashing lights all over the mouse either.__________My favourite game to use this on at the moment is on IL-2 1964, a WW2 flight simulator. Using this along with my T.Flight One X HOTAS, I switch between low DPis during Dog Fights & fast DPi for looking around during Aircraft Pursuits & Projectile evasions. The game may be from 2006, but having a wireless mouse for my set up is great.__________I have only dropped this mouse 7 times so far & my I felt an instant rush of stress each time. All due to the fact I didn't pay for the warranty fee, I have never been so careful using & storing away a PC mouse before.",

                "reviewText": "Me gust\u00f3 mucho el rat\u00f3n. Puedo decir que es para manos grandes y si lo usan para Gaming, entonces es para agarre de palma o de claw. Fingertip les quedar\u00eda algo corta la mano y los cansar\u00eda despu\u00e9s de varias horas de uso.En mi caso mi mano es mediana y se adapta perfecto a los primeros 2 agarres mencionados.Este mouse es excelente con la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda, calidad, est\u00e9tica, peso (no es tan ligero como a muchos nos gustar\u00eda pero igual no se siente pesado en mano) y sobre todo el RGB muy bonito.",
