This replaced a logitek mouse that was so heavy and back-weighted, it slid around at the slightest body /laptop movement, which drove me crazy. This mouse is much more evenly weighted and while I refuse to use a mousepad, the slip & slide antics are now more reasonable and easier to control.",

And when it falls on the floor the thing blows apart like a kids toy thrown against the wall! The mouse goes one way, the battery cover another, and the battery goes rolling across the floor under the couch. If you find all the pieces you can put it back together and it will continue working, and it will survive multiple drops if you can find all the pieces!The good: It fits my hand well. It has \"back\" and \"forward\" buttons. And did I mention it is durable, if you can find all the pieces?Ok, addendum to the review. This POS fell on the floor for the last time. My blood glucose was really low, I was jumpy, I couldn't easily find the battery nor the back. That damned thing went flying across the room! It hit the trash can, bounced out and fell on the floor again! Amazon owes me a new mouse! Yes, it works but only if you are at a desk in a room with a carpeted floor!Ok, adding more to the review... I dug this thing out of the trash, put the battery back in, found the back and reinstalled it (taped it on this time!) and this thing is still working a month and a half later! These things are INCREDIBLY tough! And, when the battery compartment cover is taped on so it doesn't come off when it falls on the floor, they work really well!",

I did like the color, size and it was comfortable to use. If you don't care about it being silent, it seems like a nice mouse for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Went with an inexpensive mouse since I tend to lose or break them when dropped on the floor too often. As such, this mouse works good enough for the price range. There is some initial lag when it has sat still for just a few minutes. Same goes for roller. Not as quick to get going as a few other inexpensive pointing devices I have used. Also, the click is way to soft and subtle for my preference but it is accurate in function and timing. Overall, good choice for the price but if you want the very best and most alert and highly sensitive mouse, this may not be the best choice.",
