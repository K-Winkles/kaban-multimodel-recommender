                "reviewText": "I have two desktop computers that are identical, bought at the same exact time, One is mine, and my boyfriend uses the other, We've had them now about 5 years replaced the mice a week ago, and decided to replace the keyboards mine worked fine, however my letters had been wearing off since like the second week of owning it. HIs on the other hand I hated if I had to touch the keyboard all the keys stuck, you'd spend longer trying to get a key to work than what it would take to type out an actual sentence on a working keyboard. The keyboards I replaced were low profile keys, they were flat, supposed to help keep crumbs and such from getting under them. But I wanted to go back to \"Old school\" keyboards ones I knew held up well to his computer game playing, and mad at people online on a game typing (throwing the keyboard down, typing hard etc etc.) Plus I just missed the big chunky keyboard feel.I saw this keyboard for around $9.99 and got two, I am very pleased with it, I will have to get used to the backspace key being small again and the enter key being huge, but that's how I remember it being on the chunky key keyboards it's just been ages since I used one.Even though it is a chunky key type keyboard it is not loud there is no mechanical clinking and clanking when I type, Really all I hear is a light clicking and it doesn't annoy me at al;, where as back in the day the loud clanking kind did. This is a regular sized keyboard, it has the Power/sleep/wake keys on it, has the led light above the keypad for when you have cap locks/num locks and or scroll lock on. There are no volume keys for sound, which I am okay with I have no problem using my mouse to turn my volume up on my taskbar, and honestly my last keyboard had it and it annoyed me very much, I'd go to hit my print screen button and hit volume up instead.The keyboard over all feels durable yet light weight, it has the \"feet\" on the underside to prop it up a bit so you're not using it flat as a pancake, which can cause pain in your hands and wrist.I wish the plug was a bit longer, but other than that I'm thrilled with the entire keyboard, and the cord is just a minor issue I'm used to a super long cord - probably way too long for a keyboard to be honest -If you're in need of a decent no fill basic keyboard , this will work for you. and the price isn't bad either!",
