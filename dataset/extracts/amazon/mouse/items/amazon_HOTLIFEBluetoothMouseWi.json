(My last one did not so I always had to make sure I didn't lose that little thing whenever I took it off.)You can use it with the mouse lights on or off. They are nice but personally it didn't matter to me if my mouse lit up or not. But for those who love using colored lights, I'm sure you will love it.Cons: none",

                "reviewText": "I bought the original mouse and it worked for about 2 days. Right out of the box the scroll wheel was tight in one section and took a lot of effort to operate. After about two days the cursor started jumping around the screen when I wasn't touching the mouse. If I moved the mouse it would stop for a short while but a couple hours later it became totally useless when it starting moving the pointer constantly. I sent it back for an exact exchange which came the next day (Thanks, Amazon!). Unfortunately this mouse was bad from the moment I turned it on. The scroll wheel has a similar issue of tightness in just one area, the power button sits lower than the sliders on the bottom of the mouse which causes it to drag on the mouse pad, and this one is also experiencing the same cursor issue as the mouse previous to it. I am sending this one back and getting a totally different brand.The one thing that really sticks out to me is the \"QC Passed,\" sticker that sealed both mouse boxes when they arrived. I'm sure that sticker is just a decoration because neither of these could have passed a quality control test.",
