                "reviewText": "I needed a GOOD mouse for my Linux/Ubuntu platform, and this mouse fits the bill completely! Very happy with it. If feels good in the hand, no tension, no aches, it's ergonomic most definitely. I also use a rechargeable NiMH battery set with this mouse, and that is flawless operation. I also use the graphics software G.I.M.P.(Adobe Photoshop alternative) and Inkscape( Adobe Illustrator and Corel DRAW alternative) extensively, and this mouse completes tasks without fail. Now, for THE BAD - Unlike many Windows-based mice, they have a red LED to operate the mouse movement sensor, this mouse uses an infra-red LED, so there is no red glow of the mouse. The instruction booklet strongly recommends a light colored or white mouse pad to enhance the energy saving feature built-in to the mouse. This is kinda tough when a majority of mouse pads are black! If you step away from the computer, the mouse will go to sleep. Instead of moving the mouse to wake it up, a simple roll of the mouse wheel will wake it up, and then you are off an computing again. Linux is so smooth and glitch-free initially, and this mouse makes it enjoyable to use. Hope this helps if you are considering this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "This mouse is really amazing. This mouse size is perfect (I have large hands) The weight is perfect and it works great. The auto off has not been an issue so far as some people noted and hopefully it will not be in the future. Overall after a month of use I highly recommend this mouse and will buy more for other family members.Update after 5 months....I have owned lot of these cheaper mice but I have to say this is by far my favorite. It is fast and accurate and the speed button works perfect. As for the auto shut off that works perfect too and I like it. Never an issue at all and the minute you touch a button or move the wheel its active again. I have purchased a few more for my other family members and still no issues at all with any of them. I highly recommend this mouse, you just can go wrong for the price and I assure you that you will love it too.",
