                "reviewText": "I had the M901 before this, the differences are sligh: This has finger rests on the right side. This is heavier - only using two of the 8 optional weights vs all 8 in the M901. The cable is drastically better - super soft, doesn't drag, well-braided. It also swapped colour profiles for the LEDs to signify which DPI setting is set for a 4 LED (5 state, including all off) identifier and the RGB being a separate profile.The macro abilities of the software are perfectly good, it's just ugly and uses a tab for every button instead of one top and one side tab and headers. Not sure if it's notworthy, but every button is indeed fully macro-able, including the pre-set dpi buttons on top and that odd \"fire\" button on top, which quickly became my preferred location for a \"back\" button. You need to grab said software off the redragon site and it wasn't linked in the manual (at least not mine) - a web search will sort you out. The M901 had more pleasing software, but it's fine.I have quite large palms and short fingers, it's almost perfect for a palm-grip in my hand. YMMV, not sure what you'd want with different hands than I have, but my ring and pinky fingers fit neatly in the little grooves and it feels quite comfortable immediately.This is an excellent mouse for general computer use and browsing - quite nice to put refresh, close tab, back, forward, new tab, open my computer, copy and paste, etc all on your mouse-hand. Tempted to get a numpad/macro-pad for my left hand so the arrow keys, numpad, and enter can all be left hand and then I'd only need both hands on keyboard to actually type.For gaming, eh, dunno and don't really care. I've used the M901 before to move awkward hotkeys to the mouse and might do it again if I play such a game with this mouse - but mostly I like having general computing shortcuts on my mouse.Anyway I recommend -- tho the 811 which has forward/back buttons and 8 keys on the side instead of twelve looks interesting, it does not have the \"fire\" button on top I've come to most prefer as my actual \"back\" button. I'd only really recommend the 901 over this if it's at least 5 USD cheaper or it is more comfortable a shape for you.",

I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better. In fact, I've never had any mouse last more than 2 years without developing some sort of problem needing a replacement mouse. This can get expensive. I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -. The extra front button is programmed as a triple left click. This makes it easy to assign keybinds in games without using macros.The bad.The twelve side buttons are small. The sensor prefers a mouse pad, and it stutters on my bare desk surface. Some people complain about the macro software, but it's similar to any other, and easy to use. Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup. When switching from wired to wireless (by unplugging the USBC) it takes several seconds to restablish a connection. Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons). My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it. No regrets.",

                "reviewText": "Its taking me a while to get uses to the feel of this mouse. Its a lot wider than my old mouse. I bought it for the number pad on the side. I guess I have a big thumb as it is hard to select the right number button. They are angled to try and select the right button and I will keep trying. The battery life is shorter than my previous mouse that has RGB lights. I do like the feel of the thumb wheel and buttons. I like that you can adjust the DPI with a simple button push. Not to crazy of the triple shot button, would like to be able to adjust the sensitivity of it. The last issue is the software that you install on your PC to program the mouse. It took a lot of work to get around McAfee web to download and install. No clear instructions on how to get around it. I purchased this mouse not for gaming but music writing with MuseScore. It makes it quicker to press the number buttons on the mouse than taking your hand off the mouse and press a keyboard pad. Worth the price and well built. Takes getting use to but feel good in hand, that is if you have a large hand. Great control. Does take time to charge but you can either plug it in a usb charger or into your computer and not bother with the dongle. Have fun. Maybe I'll play MIST with it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on this MMO gaming mouse, and I've been putting it to the test in various gaming scenarios. First off, let's talk about the DPI settings. You can easily toggle through different sensitivity levels using a dedicated button. It's straightforward, making it less of a hassle when you need to switch up your playstyle. I also found out that you can fine-tune these settings even further through some additional software, giving you the control you need for each game you play.Moving on to the buttons \u2014 oh, there are so many buttons. The side of the mouse looks like a keyboard in itself. At first glance, it seems overwhelming, but I discovered that it's a real boon for MMO games where you have a ton of actions and spells at your disposal. I didn't need to worry about confusing the buttons because you can customize them according to what makes sense for you. You can set up keybinds for different games and scenarios, making it easier to execute complex moves without breaking a sweat.Comfort is another strong suit of this mouse. The right-hand grip design feels tailor-made for long gaming sessions, letting me play for extended periods without fatigue. The weight-tuning set that comes with it allows you to adjust the mouse to your personal preference. Whether you prefer a lighter or heavier feel, this mouse has got you covered.Lighting-wise, this mouse doesn't disappoint. It has various backlit modes, each with a dedicated light color for quick identification. I found this particularly useful for knowing what profile I had active at a glance, without having to dig into software settings. The RGB LED options are also customizable, allowing you to match the mouse with the rest of your gaming setup.Overall, I've been pretty impressed with this MMO gaming mouse. It offers a wide range of customizable options from DPI settings to button configurations and even lighting modes. The comfort is top-notch, and it holds up well during marathon gaming sessions. Whether you're into MMOs or just need a reliable mouse with plenty of buttons for productivity tasks, this one could be a solid choice for you.Pros-- Customizable DPI-- Many buttons-- Comfortable ergonomicsCons-- Button clutter, maybe too many buttons?-- Heavy",

                "reviewTitle": "Upgrade from G600",
                "reviewText": "I like my G600 but hate its wire. Decided to try M913 many because it is cheap and really I did not expect it to work. But it does. This is crazy. I enjoy using mouses with multiple buttons while working and I am really into macros. Talking about macros, M913 is godlike.First of all, M913 stores all your macro \"on-the-board\". This means the mouse has its own memory and it literally remember the macros. In other words, if you just unplug it and plug into a different PC, macros will work. This is simply crazy. This is a premium feature and for those famous brand it is usually only available on the most expensive models. Consider the price doubled if it is wireless.The second craziness comes from the mouse's driver, which you can download from their website. According to its graphical interface, it seems like a super old framework is used (winform?). But its functionalities are perfect. Similar as other brand's driver, it allows you to record keystokes. The different thing is, it allows to change every single keystroke separately after you have record the macro. The stall time between each keystroke can be customerized as well.Drawbacks:1. Side buttons' clicking feel is not as good as G6002. Side button's angles are not as perfect as G600. Can be a problem for MMO mouse rookies (mis-click)3. DPI buttons cannot be customized4. RGB can hardly be customerized5. Does not have shift functionalities like G600's G-shift6. Wheel cannot be tilt. This make it 2 buttons less. And that two are actually the best kind of buttons: easy use & hardly misclick.7. Driver's keystroke recording mechanism does not work with 'win' button well. Pretty sure this is a bug. But an easy workaround is to replace the 'win' button with something else (e.g. 'A') while recording, and change that specific key later manually. That is what happen when you actually spend time to build a robust driver, partial functionalities is sufficient to still make things work.Overall:As can be seen the drawbacks are basically tiny issues. This mouse has no critical problem and did what it advertised. I am really surprised by its driver, it does have problem but I feel it is more robust than Logitech G Hub. Ugly thing that work is always better than fancy stuff that does not work. Finally the price, it is simply too cheap. Reddragon built a 50 bucks product that stands the same level as other brands' 150 bucks mouse. I recommend this product.Update:It seems like not only the key stroke recording process has problem with \"win\", same issue applies to the default profile auto save. If you create a macro with \"win\" using my workaround and deploy to your mouse, it will work. However, if you restart your driver, the \"win\" key will disappear in your macro. I think there is something wrong with its save/load functionalities for the default profile (it cannot recognize \"win\" and decides to ignore it). Fortunately its customer export/import feature does recognize \"win\", and therefore you can keep your \"win\" key by creating backup manually.",
