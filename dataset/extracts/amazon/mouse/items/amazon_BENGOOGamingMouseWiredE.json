It's been serving me well, holding up well, and is overall a great purchase.My only issues are1) i cannot control the flashing? I can turn it off, but I can't place it on one specific color. Not a huge deal, but it'd be cool if I could do that.2) The side buttons are extremely sensitive and easy to press onto. This is mostly ok in gaming - hell , preferred even, but in casual page viewing, it often reloads pages, back tabs, or closes tabs altogether WAY to easily.Love the logo, love the feel of it. My complaints are minor and brief, honestly, so 5 stars for me.",

I needed something fast, so I ordered this one with next day shipping for something like $15. I really didn't expect it to be anywhere near the quality of my old mouse at all, how could I? It's like $15, not the 90 that my Logitech optical one was... yeah this thing blew me away. It feels like quality. It's a fairly ergonomic design, has a braided cord, and glides smoothly. I needed to get a mouse pad for myself because the surface I was using it on didn't agree with it, which happens, but I think I will grab a couple more soon just as backups, just in case",
