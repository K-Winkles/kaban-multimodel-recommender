                "reviewText": "This product is incredibly comfortable, to the point I have gotten the same mouse from the same company multiple times since June 2018 (bought about 5-6 of them). I have small hands which makes most mice incredibly uncomfortable; I use the computer constantly, and this is one of the only mice that doesn't quickly give me hand cramps. I appreciate it enough where I've chosen to bring this with me to use when I have to use other people's computers to avoid the hand cramps I get with other ones. It works plug-n-play and has a hole at the bottom for the USB connector so I haven't had using it on other computers (Windows). I'm also a fan of the side buttons, it's used quite often to move back or forward a page.Now, Battery Life. I feel like it can go through batteries kinda quick. Perhaps couple weeks or once a month? I personally don't mind as I have rechargeable batteries so it isn't a downside, and I'm not sure the battery life on other mice to compare.The worst part is something you'll see in other reviews: the scroll wheel starts acting up and moving up/down. This is honestly quite annoying, and is why part of why I put it to 4 stars. I will say however they do have a rather generous warranty for such a cheap product as it lasts a whole year.For a ~$8 mouse I would very much recommend it, especially if you find most mouses too big but the laptop/'portable' mouses too small. I have tried a few different mouses in the past, including ergonomic, but I just couldn't help but return to this one.",

The same AA battery lasted me 1-2 years, and it had to be replaced because I accidentally spilled hot chocolate on my mouse (the first one I purchased) - long story. Anywho, get the mouse; it's good. Plus, my hand does not cramp up after using it for an extended period. So, if you have a laptop and your hands get cramps after using the touchpad for extended periods, you might like this, and it would give your hand a break.",
