                "reviewText": "I have been using this for at least 3 weeks now, and it's been working very well. I bought it for my android tablet Samsung Galaxy s7+, although I have a keyboard case with the mouse pad, but I don't like using that touchpad mousepad built in with the keyboard, I like the traditional mouse to hold like this one. Especially if you're playing games, but most of the time I'm doing browsing and a lot of clicking, One charge and I've been using for at 3 weeks, no re-charge yet. Very comfortable since it's small and light to hold. I have not have any issue with connectivity either and my android tablet was able to pair with multiple devices including this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "The little mouse works good. We'll for the price it's more than enough. Wouldn't really recommend it for someone who plays games or need something really precise. But for regular everyday use like checking emails, browsing the web, editing videos/pics it more than enough.Pros:-Can be used with Bluetooth or wifi.-Long battery run time per charge. Plus it's rechargeable.-Works on a white desk where my standard wired mouse didn't and needed a pad.-The RGB lights are cool-The mouse sensitivity and speed can you quickly adjusted by the little buttonCons:-I notice a slight delay. Not sure if it's because of the mouse, bluetooth settings, or simply my laptop. Not really a big issue, but that's why I don't recommend it for gaming.-The silent clickers is nice, but the tactical feel is not the same for the left and right clicks. The left is too soft compared to the right click. This is probably due to low quality control.-The scroll wheel doesn't feel nice like a standard mouse. Mines feel cheap when scrolling and pushing down on the wheel.-Its's a compact mouse, but has a very plastic feel.I would buy again as a back up mouse. Since this wireless mouse works good enough for what I need. Might even buy a couple and leave them at my work, home, and laptop bag when traveling.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this mouse for about a year now.This little mouse has been excellent for me! I put a magnetic charger on the front to make it easier to charge with current technology.It comes with bluetooth capabilities, so connects to my Samsung Galaxy tab S7FE pretty easily with good stability of connection, I rarely have an issue with it not clicking, and even then, most of the time its because it turns itself off when not in use.It comes with a USB dongle, so I am able to connect it to my laptop without unpairing it from my tablet! A simple slider switch on the bottom changes it from bluetooth, to off, to USB dongle in an instant.The slider switch on the bottom drags just a bit on smooth surfaces, so I recommend a mouse pad, and the mouse is just a little small compared to a standard sized mouse, takes some time to get used to. overall, I cant complain at all! Its tackled any challenge I throw at it, and has withstood the test of time for over a year, its been around the world with me and back, and has never given me any issues.10/10 would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Originally - like a couple of hours after my mouse arrived and was in use, I wrote the following review:THe only thing I don't like about this purchase is the charging cable. It is a pathetic scrap of cable. Because my USB ports are all behind my PC tower - which is tucked away in a ventilated cabinet under my desk, BTW - I had to go out and buy an extension cable, just to be able to charge my mouse from a power board (secured to the underside of my desk) and have the mouse on the desk, and not hanging in mid-air. Cannot fathom why the manufacturer thought a 17cm cable would be sufficient. It's not as if a longer cable would have broken the bank...NOW, though - on New Year's Eve and after persevering with the device, I have changed my opinion. I am not liking this mouse. It has to be recharged every single night, and does not make it through an 8 hour day without being connected by an extension lead (attached to it's pitiful lead) to my PC for power. It also goes to sleep very quickly, and then you have to click the wretched thing to get it to wake up. The problem with that is that if your cursor was somewhere undesirable when the mouse went to sleep, you're living dangerously when you have to click to wake the thing up! I've deleted stuff, closed webinars without warning and generally lost stuff because this stupid mouse likes to go to sleep at the drop of a hat.It will not be in my house to see tomorrow arrive.",
