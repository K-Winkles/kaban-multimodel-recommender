                "reviewText": "I work from home and prefer a wireless mouse to be able to move freely. For the first 6 months this mouse worked perfectly, never had any connectivity issues or issues with the mouse itself.Eventually I noticed the scroll wheel wouldn\u2019t work properly. Little things like scrolling down either wouldn\u2019t register or would start scrolling up instead. It would do this for a few seconds then start working properly. This began gradually and then became more frequent.I then started to notice a precipitous drop in the battery life, going from lasting a full week to just one day. I do use it all day so it may be that the battery just doesn\u2019t have the capacity for long work hours.The issue now is that the laser does not recognize where I\u2019m moving. It will either not register me moving and I\u2019ll need to move several times to get where I want, or it will move on its own to a completely different part of the screen.This mouse started out wonderful, but became almost useless. I guess $10 for about a year is okay. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap mouse that you\u2019ll only use sparingly, this is a good option. If you want a mouse for working and will use it everyday, 8 hours per day, shell out the money for a higher quality mouse.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works well",
                "reviewText": "This thing works well most of the time. If you don\u2019t turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode, it dies fairly quickly but you still get a couple of days of use out of it (if you\u2019re not using it 8 hours a day, at least). If you turn it off every time you\u2019re done though you can get probably a month but at least 2 weeks out of it with moderate use. I originally bought it to use with my iPad, however the case on my iPad wouldn\u2019t really allow the USB-C to plug into the charger port. I wish they made an option to get either a USB or a USB-C plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the USB into the USB-C adapter which makes the USB-C plug significantly thicker than necessary. Now I use it for my MacBook. Just a warning, if you want it to scroll like a regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer (but that\u2019s a MacBook problem not a problem with this mouse, not all of Apple\u2019s setting decisions make sense but that\u2019s nothing new). I do really like that I can chose to just turn on the mouse with a solid red color (which preserves battery) or turn it on to change colors (reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is a cool feature). My only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn\u2019t tracking perfectly and the cursor is in a completely different place than I would expect it to be (further behind where I was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing), but that may also be a thing I have to change on the laptop.",

Not ergonomic but not uncomfortable either. It shuts off when not in use to preserve the charge. I was surprised at how long the charge holds given how light weight the mouse is. To be on the safe side, get accustomed to plugging it back in to charge when you leave work/play for the day. I thought this was going to be my replacement mouse for my old one that finally died but I think I'll spend a little more to get a wired ergonomic mouse. I am keeping this one as a backup because it is so thin and lightweight.",
