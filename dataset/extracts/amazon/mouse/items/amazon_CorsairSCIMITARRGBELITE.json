To be fair, the mouse did not register for me in ICUE at first, either. But the cause is fairly obvious. They are using an old version of ICUE... from before this mouse even existed. Literally all you need to do is update the software. I attached screenshots proving it shows up and works, along with what software revisions they are on right now. Yeah, that's it... just update your software. There is a button in the corner.For the mouse itself, it is ALMOST identical to the old wired version. There are a few minor aesthetic downgrades. For some reason they removed the RGB in the mouse wheel, plus the light in front of the side buttons is gone too. Also, it has one less button on the top, behind the mouse wheel. The fit and feel is the same.I would certainly be happier without those random minor downgrades, but they are super minor and the upgrade of FINALLY having a wireless version of this mouse is 100% worth it. I love this mouse and have been on the lookout for a wireless version for years. It is the best MMO mouse, and now finally wireless.",

                "reviewText": "Probably one of the best mice there is. However, ICue for Mac is the worst software. It takes up so much memory and it crashes almost always. If you look online, you\u2019ll see, I\u2019m not alone in this opinion. However, there is a workaround. Karabiner elements freeware however, you will probably need to have a limited understanding of scripting to get the most out of the software, limited features like setting the mouse buttons can be difficult in macOS, so be aware before you buy this mouse, if you are Mac-based. The feel and fit of the mouse is great. The buttons can be moved so they fit your hand correctly. The dpi is wonderful and once you\u2019ve used a mouse with such precision, you\u2019ll never want to use anything with less dpi. In my opinion, enduring the crappy software issue is well worth it for the quality hardware you get.",

                "reviewText": "PROS:ergonomic: I can claw grip it! mouse is not too long, not too tall, not too widelighting: it has 5 zones that you can configure individuallysoftware is great: used to be horrible, they improved it a lot since launch.onboard memory: you can configure your lighting, keybinds, etc. once and never open the software again. up to 3 onboard profiles, very nice!scroll is comfortable, not too stiff and surface doesn't hurt my finger... looking at you, Logitech g305 lightspeed >:(CONS:keypad light is a bit dim: this is not a big problem long term because I probably won't even see the buttons when I get used to it but still a bit disappointing that the keys are dimmer than the other lighting zones.weight: a bit on the heavier side but I probably won't notice after using it for a week or two.coating: it feels and looks amazing right now, but will definitely wear out with time and will not be pretty.side buttons: this might be the only real con I could find in this mouse... the corners are SHARP. my thumb gets caught between the rows and it hurts after doing it a couple times. bear in mind I just got the mouse, maybe I get used to it later, idk----------------------------------the marketing pictures make it seem like a humongous mouse that would force me to me palm grip it, but it actually isn't that big. putting it side by side with my Logitech g305 lightspeed is just a bit bigger and heavier. I can claw grip it okay, all side keys accessible thanks to that adjustable keypad. for reference, the length of my hand from tip of middle finger to wrist is 7,5 inches. I think smaller hands might still be able to claw grip it.cable is not too stiff but not soft either. get a bungee or diy one.overall very satisfied with the purchase.",

It comes with a small allen key that you just loosen on the bottom of the mouse and slide the whole side panel to your liking. It does require a little bit of set up, but no big deal. Just follow the instructions. There\u2019s also YouTube videos. Takes about five minutes to adjust your key binds and you\u2019re good to go.",

Everything from the build quality, number pad adjustment, build materials and easy sync with iCUE for the RGB lights was perfect. Being a wired mouse as well was also a big plus for me, since I prefer them over wireless, and the braided cable meant it wasn't going to break anytime soon (which after a few months, I can safely say hasn't).Ergonomically, the mouse fits really nice in the hand. It has a premium weighted feel, is just the right size, and every curve and notch fits flawlessly into your palm.The mouse is also full customisable in button mapping, DPI setting and RGB lights, with total compatibility with Corsair's iCUE program.Finding a fault on this mouse is like finding a needle in a haystack, it really is that good. It became my daily driver for both work and gaming, and unless it falls into severe disrepair, will be with me for many years to come.",
