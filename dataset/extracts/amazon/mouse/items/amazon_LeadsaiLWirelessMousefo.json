The price was better at Amazon but the quality better, as well. I'm very pleased with it's performance and expect many years from this product. It also looks lovely and you can pick different colors. I chose blue; my other one was red. I can say that the product and color was true to its description and design. I truly recommend this product.",

I had a mouse that was noiseless before this one, and it had 0 sound. This one doesn't have that loud clicking, but it's a very subtle clicking sound that comes out. Once again, it isn't loud, just a very tiny click noise. I still recommend this, 100%!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mouse since I couldn\u2019t find the original one that I had purchased years ago haha which was very similar to this one anywho I have now been using this mouse for about 8 months. Very lightweight, easy to set up as well, the battery lasts a long time I would say about 3 months since it is powered by batteries. A word of advice is to always keep extra batteries in hand because the only thing I don\u2019t like is that it does not tell you when the battery is low simply the mouse just stops working and that\u2019s the key for the battery to be changed. I purchased the sky blue color it\u2019s very nice!!",
