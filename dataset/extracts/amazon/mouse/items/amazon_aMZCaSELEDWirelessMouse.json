                "reviewText": "This mouse, despite that it omits Linux as being compatible in the details of the product description, does indeed work with Linux. I have tested and used it on the following distributions: Ubuntu (23.04 and 22.04 LTS), Fedora (33, 38), Pop!OS (22.04 LTS) as well as a highly restricted and minimal Fedora 33 install where a lot of drivers are simply not present in the kernel.In every single case the all functions of the mouse worked, flawlessly, including the scroll wheel that doubles as a third mouse button. The DPI functions as well work as expected. None of these required additional software.Yes, I tested also with the original Windows 10 release all the way to the latest Windows 11 release. Zero problems as well.Battery life is irrelevant, this is a 100% wired mouse.For sleep mode, that is more of a function related to wireless mice. Because this mouse is wired it is powered by the USB bus on your computer. So if you want to use the mouse after your computer has entered sleep / standby mode then you need to make sure that your BIOS / UEFI is configured to allow \"wake from USB\".",

                "reviewText": "I had been using Microsoft's Arc Mouse for a couple of years and really liked them. Then, I got a couple sticks of Corsair's RGB RAM and wanted to stay with the RGB theme when my last mouse started showing signs of slowing down, so I picked this one. I really liked the idea of being able to recharge the mouse directly, without replacing the batteries-still do, in fact. BUT the scroll wheel is dead. Only eight months after landing on my desk, and this wheel has decided that it just doesn't want to do its job, anymore. I dunno. I guess I didn't pay that much for it, but I still think that's kinda crappy.",

                "reviewText": "I was very disappointed with the functioning of this mouse. The ergonomics were ok, the build quality seemed very nice and the price point was excellent. The problem with it seems to be the complete lack of out of box support under Windows 10 Pro. I tried it on several USB ports, both on my motherboard and on an externally powered hub. I also tried it after several reboots with my current mouse installed and removed. No dice. The basic Human Interface controller functionality (i.e. the cheapest mouse you can get) did not function properly so the mouse pointer would not move. The box/material had no website to check for a driver and a hotmail address as the wholesale contact (I knew I was in serious trouble when I saw that lol )The buttons did click as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However without mouse motion functionality the mouse is useless. This definitely points to hardware support issues (or a bad mouse). I do believe this mouse is zoned for sale by the manufacturer in some region of the world where it is probably supplied with foreign language drivers. An hour of searching on the Internet yielded no safe driver download (no driver download at all in fact). This is my first 1 star review on Amazon and I've been a member almost since its inception. I'm sure with proper hardware support this product would be worth the money but in this age of high DPI, software controlled mice selling something like this on Amazon is not a good idea if you want good feedback. If the full basic human interface functionality at say 2200 dpi had worked without the driver as it should have I would have given the product 3 stars, as it stands it is useless so I have to give it 1 star and return it.",

Not a dealbreaker for me but did make me go \"aw man\".",
