The outside has a soft touch but is a plastic maybe they put a coating on it or something and is very good. This thing has different selectable colors, actually got one that matches my PC and looks pretty good on the desk.When I use this mouse I can change the DPI easily, turn the light on/off or a different color. I think the wheel is metal and has got to be the best I have ever used, it is easy to roll and grips to your finger nicely. It has the press in on the wheel so you can do the autoscroll etc. Yeah this thing is great.",

Well packaged, looks awesome, and the wired version is nice because there\u2019s no messing around with connectivity. I just preferred the good old fashioned ease of a wired mouse.I have noticed improvement in my wrist and hand pain. I recommend ergonomic mice to everyone.If I had one complaint, it would be that the material of the outside/shell of the mouse, while smooth and comfortable, has no grip. If you want to pick the mouse up or reposition it on your mousepad, it\u2019s nearly impossible to grab and lift. Your fingers slide right off. I have to grip my fingers under the bottom edge to lift and move. Very minor, doesn\u2019t affect my rating, but something worth mentioning I think.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time trying a vertical mouse, so I can't speak to how it compares to others on the market, but so far I like it a lot. It's very comfortable to rest your hand on, and it has all the functionality of a traditional mouse (including forward and back buttons) so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by using it. I don't think I'm quite as accurate with it as with my old mouse (at least not yet), but it's not a steep learning curve; within two minutes I was browsing the web as normal without really thinking about it.For the price, the build quality and featureset is surprisingly good. The soft-touch finish and metal scroll wheel make it easy to forget that it's not a more expensive name-brand product. There are a few minor details that let it down a little, however:- There's no configuration software or on-board memory, so they mouse is reset any time it loses power. You can choose between 4 DPI levels with the button behind the scroll wheel, but there's no indication of which option is selected and you'll be back to the default as soon as you unplug it or turn off your computer. You're better off just changing the pointer speed in your OS.- The LEDs are fun, but there's so many different patterns that you probably won't bother to cycle around to your favorite every time. Mine also has a strange uneven pink hue in the white mode which detracts from the look somewhat. It feels like the lighting was added mostly for the sake of the product photo. That said, you can hold down the top button to turn it off if you want (at least until you unplug it, sigh).- The base is a little bit smaller than the full size of the mouse, so I sometimes tilt it over to the left unintentionally. It's not a huge problem but I'm not sure why the base couldn't be slightly wider to prevent this.Despite the flaws, I think this is a great mouse for someone that wants to try out a more ergonomic design without spending too much. The clicks click, the scroll scrolls, and the size seems like it would work for most people.",

But let me tell you, it seems to be much more comfortable to use than a standard mouse. I'm using it for work so not sure how well it does for gaming. Overall, I think it's a great deal and hopefully it last a while.",

It takes some getting used to but I adjusted quickly. I do wish there was a bit more of a skirt under the hand. As it is my hand either drags across the table or I have to actively hold it up a bit. But for the price this is an excellent entry into ergonomic vertical mice.",

                "reviewText": "Update: After almost a year, the left button has started to fail. I have to place my finger in JUST the right spot and press VERY hard, or it doesn't register. Tried cleaning it, moving it to another USB slot, etc, but now it's becoming a chore to use. Will have to find another model when I get a new mouse; I like my hardware to last more than a year, and this one fell a month short of that. Disappointing, because I liked this one, but I won't buy another one if it's just going to fail.Once I tried a vertical mouse, I couldn't go back. However, I made the mistake of getting wireless models- they're prone to scroll wheel issues and a short overall battery life.This one has a sturdy metal scroll wheel that has a good feel to it, and the texture of the mouse itself is nice and smooth with a slight softness to it that doesn't get sticky or tacky. I marked off a star for gaming because it's not a gaming mouse, but it does alright for a casual MMO player like me.My carpal tunnel has thanked me for this mouse- yours will, too.",
