The mouse itself is also very comfy and fits inside the palm very nice. The tracking is also very good, and has held up over time without degrading. The lights are also nice because they can be turned off in case you don't need them on, or don't like RGB lights. Sometimes my mouse will bug out and the tracking will go all crazy but I think that's because I have smacked it against the table on accident a few times, and is not a fault of the mouse itself.",

                "reviewText": "I almost gave this five stars. It is one of the most comfortable mouse devices I've used. It fits the hand well and feels a little lower-profile than most mice (mouses?). It reacts well, the buttons are totally quiet, and the light is not distracting (if it is it can be turned off).I give it only 4 stars for two reasons: 1) The light does not have a memory, so your preferred mode out of 5 options has to be reset whenever you turn the system on. 2) There are no forward/back buttons that are found on many mice. Still, for a basic ten-dollar mouse it's very nice.It gets a solid 4 stars for several reasons: 1) It is rounded to the feel, without sharp edges. My prior mouse was a neat, sci-fi looking 'gamer' mouse, but the edges were squared off and could be uncomfy. This feels nice and comfy to the hand. 2) It can be used as a right or left-handed mouse (unlike some gamer mice). 3) It is a very functional, simple mouse. It has one 1600 dpi setting that is fairly perfect for computer use. The user doesn't have to mess with multiple settings that 99.99% of users out there don't need. 4) The price is reasonable.So overall I'm quite pleased with this mouse. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive or fancier mice, but it does what a mouse is supposed to do, well and comfortably. It's not so bright that it messes with my vision while using it, and it controls the pointer/cursor very well... which really is bottom line, what a mouse is supposed to do.",

                "reviewText": "The changing colors on this thing are fun, but the real beauty of it for me is the size. I have 'chunky' hands for a woman and it's a very good fit. It's lightweight, moves smoothly and easily, has excellent sensitivity plus the price is excellent.This is a replacement for the same model I bought last year. Unfortunately that one gave out as it kept slipping off my mouse pad and hitting the floor or sometimes other objects. Dang! I have a 'pull-out' articulating keyboard tray with an attached articulating mouse support. If I leave the mouse support in the wrong position, the mouse will fall. But Amazon worked their magic and I had my new one the next day.So what's my point? Failure of the previous mouse was my fault, so I'm being much more careful with this one and expect it to last MUCH longer.This is a great mouse considering the price! So if you need a new one, this is a good one to try.",
