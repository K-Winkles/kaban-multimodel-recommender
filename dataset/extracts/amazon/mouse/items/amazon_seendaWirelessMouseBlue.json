This ensures that your PC remains active even if the mouse enters deep sleep mode. To exit this mode, simply press and hold the control button for 3-5 seconds; 3. After 60 seconds of inactivity, the mouse will automatically enter sleep mode, causing the LED backlight to turn off. To wake it up, simply click any button on the mouse. In case of 15 minutes of inactivity, the mouse will go into deep sleep mode, and all LED indicators will turn off. Once again, clicking any button will wake it up from deep sleep mode; 4. The backward and forward button is not fully compatible with Mac OS. If you experience mouse lag or the backlit turns off automatically, it may indicate low battery.

                "reviewText": "While the lavender color may be a little polarizing, there\u2019s a lot to unanimously like about this economy mouse from Seenda. Built-in USB-C charging port in the front with lighting indication is convenient. The rolling RGB backlight illuminating the base, while pretty, can get old after a while even with its 22 different modes and luckily that can be easily disabled with a dedicated button at the top. It can run either using the supplied USB-A dongle, or Bluetooth, or 2.4G for flexibility in connection. Click action is nice with a muted noise level but the side browser buttons weren\u2019t able to be activated on machines running Mac OS. The jiggler function only has one mode and it\u2019s not likely any office environment will take kindly to that being used as the pace in which it makes the cursor fly around is so fast that it\u2019s too obvious for anything except WFH use. The form factor is nice for someone who likes a mouse with a smaller footprint but I found the scalloping of the side gripping area to not have enough dish to comfortably lift off the surface. Combined this ergonomic miss with weight placement that is a bit too far backward means using it in practice is a bit awkward. As for anyone looking to get this for gaming, note that it doesn\u2019t have fine scrolling or tracking adjustment and the resolution may be a hinder in some situations. It\u2019s also neither a claw grip or a palm grip type of mouse but having said all this, we\u2019re talking about a fairly full-featured all-purpose mouse for under $20 here so it generally works for the role it\u2019s intended.",

I like the look and feel of the original mouse when it used to have a long plugged in USB tail.This affordable alternative wireless mouse does everything it\u2019s supposed to with a simple and easy set up.I like the jiggle feature that helps prevent my screen from locking up with inactivity.The feel of it in my hand is the best part for me. I have a smaller hand and this one feels very natural for me.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it because of 3 device support and that part is great but for my work laptop it won't do because it's very erratic and jurkey during use e.g. if you move the mouse horizontally from side to side, it randomly moves the pointer vertically as well and with quite a distance and also skips and jumps. This while connected through the provided usb dongle which is supposed to be more stable generally.Will most probably return.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really neat mouse with some unique features. First of all it will pair to your computer or tablet by Bluetooth. It will pair to a total of three things at once, I think that will be very useful and space saving. It also has a dongle that plugs in to a USB port. I usually like the dongle type better that Bluetooth because the dongle uses RF which doesn't seem to lag so much but this mouse is goo don either system. It also has a light show that looks really neat and changes color. I haven't tried adjusting that yet but surely you can. It also has a mouse jiggler built in. It appears to load up to my computer as a standard mouse, but it also has the ability to keep your computer awake by moving the mouse around on its own.I'm using the mouse now and it does really well. I was questionable at first because in the location that my thumb sits are two buttons. I was inadvertently pressing one of the buttons and navigating away from the screen I was on. I am used to it now after just a few hours. I was probably accustomed to it after the first five minutes - but it is a little different.It charges with USB type C which is super convenient these days. Battery life seems good so far but I haven't had it on for too long.",

The light color is changeable, the battery lasts very long, and my favorite part is that you can either use it via bluetooth or with the USB port. The USB had a nifty storage mechanism that keeps it secure and out of the way when not using it.",
