On a scale of 1 to 100, 100 being pure silence, I would say it's realistically right around 95-98.-The roller wheel is silent when turning it, and when the wheel is pressed in while you're rolling it. But it's not silent when pressing it.-The DPI button is not silent when clicking to change the cursor speed, but who cares? I don't use it much.-Extremely impressed, I just bought 4 more. Comfortable in the hand too! Haven't spilled anything on it yet, will be curious to see what happens when that does happen.-12/19/20, add to review: still super quiet and no issues thus far",
