                "reviewText": "Just ordered a second one of this model after owning my first one for a year now. I have a cat that particularly loves destroying my mouse cords. Irony aside, I think it's a jealously thing. My original purchase of this was to be a cheaper replacement for my Razr Naga which costs 4x the price, yet this mouse was barely a step down - only lacking the macro keys but gaining the full RGB lights instead of just the only green that old Razr model had. The RGB on this mouse is pretty good, good enough that I like to keep it on the flowing rainbow setting to match my similar effect on the Red Dragon mechanical macro keyboard that I bought a few months after this mouse because I was impressed with the brand quality.Ergonomically it's great. Perfectly shaped large enough that you won't get hand cramps if using the device for extended periods of time. It handles with enough accuracy for 99.99% of people and only tournament ranking professionals would have reason to complain.My only negative point on this mouse is that multiple buttons are too easy to press on accident. It shouldn't be much of an issue for most people, but the side buttons stick out quite far, and it's very easy to press those back/forward buttons when first moving your hand onto the device. But once you've got a grip on it, that stops being a problem and instead a possible benefit, as those 2 side buttons are very easy to press when you want to. The top buttons that control the RGB and DPI suffer from much the same issue. Very easy to accidentally touch them and change the settings accidently. Yet once you hand is on the device, they're not in the way and you're unlikely to accidentally press either button.Build quality it's solid, and amazing for the price. It's notably not as well built as the $80 Razr mouse that I replaced with it, but the difference is small enough that I'd even consider them to be solidly in the same range of mid-cost device.As a side complaint, I'm annoyed that both of the aforementioned pointing devices, especially the $80 Razr one, do not have detachable and replaceable USB cords. I shouldn't have to buy a new device entirely just because the cord is damaged, yet a majority of mice on the market do not have swappable cords. Red Dragon definitely gets a pass on their purposefully cost-cutting design, but it's much more annoying on a luxury like the Naga.",

                "reviewText": "Redragon Gaming Mouse Beats Other Gaming Mice To start off with, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now. I have owned this mouse for about 3 years and it is just as good as brand new. When looking at the price of this mouse compared to other gaming mice, this is cheaper, durable, longer-lasting, and has most of the features as the other expensive mice have. I would most certainly recommend any interested buyers looking for a gaming mouse to buy this product. First and foremost, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now because it\u2019s cheap and affordable. When looking for a desktop gaming mouse, you should always research and look for other products that might be similar, less expensive, and easier to use especially when it comes to gaming mice. One of the popular gaming mice that is competing against the redragon mice in the market as of right now would be the glorious model o. This mouse comes around $100 in the market and functions similarly to the redragon mouse. The redragon mouse comes in around $20 as of now due to inflation as well. There isn\u2019t much of a difference between the two mice besides the shape, size, and price. Paying $80 more isn\u2019t worth it if most of the controls, and key features function the same way. Some of the key features that the glorious model o can do as well as the redragon gaming mouse are drag click, butterfly click, has the same amount of sensitivity, and DPI. The main difference between these two desktop gaming mice is that the glorious model \u201co\u201d feels much lighter and sturdier. The redragon mouse feels a little bit heavier however, it is a decent size for any beginners or experienced gamers. It also has side palm grips for you to keep your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger on support giving you the most comfortable experience as well. Some of the features that both mice can do that interested buyers would look forward to is having the mouse double click, drag click, and butterfly click. Furthermore, this mouse is very comfortable and durable for a long period of time. The gaming mouse's texture is matte which makes the gaming experience even better. There are also side buttons to change the RGB color or lighting to whichever settings you\u2019d prefer with 7-8 different color options. All of these features are adjustable just by downloading the app or software if needed. After owning this product for 3 years, I have not felt the need to buy another mouse yet at all because of how well-made it is. However, despite all of the pros mentioned, there are always a few flaws or cons since nothing is perfect. One of the cons I experienced by owning this product would be that when gaming, some of the clicks on the redragon gaming mouse don\u2019t register due to how big it is. Even though it is recommended to have lighter-weight desktop mice when gaming, it makes it harder to click while having some clicks not register. Over the past 3 years of owning this product, I have noticed that there is also a solution to fixing this problem. I have improved my gaming skills and it has made clicking faster and much easier for me. I would most definitely recommend this product to gamers who are at least experienced a little bit and have fast clicking hands to enjoy the full experience.",
