                "reviewText": "Ergo is outstanding.Scroll is outstanding. Aluminum scroll wheel with good steps.Clicks take some getting used to because they are opticals that feel a little hollow at first. Theyare on the light side of moderate and have good tactility, so overall they are decent.Side buttons have perfect placement and no travel issues.Material is a rubberized plastic that might make the hand sweaty but provides a nice texture and good grip.Weight is excellent, and feet glide effortlessly.Sensor performance is excellent, no issues.Lift off distance is low.DPI, color (x16), color mode (x5), LOD, polling rate are all configurable via on-board controls. No software required. Big selling point for me.This mouse released for $80 and is a steal for $30. Considering getting a second one because it is that good even if it also seems very durable.Performance-wise it is excellent. In terms of feel, it feels very plastic and tupperware-ish...but it is comfy tupperware and it performs!",

                "reviewText": "I wish I could be exaggerating with the title, but this mouse is absolutely incredible. I've tried every popular gaming/office mouse under the sun and my by far favorite has been the Logitech G502. However, I was recently introduced to lightweight mice and the Logitech G PRO Superlight had gotten my attention for a bit.However, I always had to swap between these as the superlight was ultimately uncomfortable and had poor skates. The G502 has always been the most comfortable, but its too heavy for quick-flick gaming.Here comes the ROCCAT Kone Pro Air. At only $30 on black friday, I didn't think too much of this mouse initially. Once I received it, I was hooked. There was no \"break in\" period, it just worked. It was amazing, I still cannot believe a mouse this comfortable and lightweight existed, I thought it was impossible. The build quality is absolutely phenomenal too. I don't think there is any mouse on the market that can beat this level of comfort + lightweight form factor.One issue however, like many reviews have mentioned, is the software. It's dog water. Let me tell you how to get it working though:1. Set the mouse setting to the center option, non-bluetooth or receiver mode. Plug it in via usb cable2. Download the software, its called Roccat Swarm.3. Plug in the receiver as well and update the firmware of the mouse. It might bug out so make sure the USB cable is plugged in first, THEN plug in the wireless transmitter.4. Once updated, then you can change your DPI. The way I did this is by making sure \"auto apply\" was selected. This is a slow process. The software is SLOW to update. There are 5 DPI options, uncheck them all except #3, that's the one it used for me. If not, just set them all to the DPI you want, such as 1600.5. Save settings. That's really it!This mouse is END GAME. If you're trying to find the balance between comfort and lightweight, this is it.",

I do have a lot of electronics on my desk but I have a cheaper mouse that doesn't skip at all like this mouse did.I did love using it but as soon as it started skipping there was no way to play my games or even search the web when its always skipping the cursor. I went back to my cheaper mouse and that's still working fine with no skips.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Mouse",
                "reviewText": "The Kone Pro Air is a great mouse. I upgraded from the wired Kone Pure Ultra. The Pro Air retains a very similar ergo shape with the thumb groove on the side, the large side buttons, and the superb mouse wheel.Since the shape was so similar, adapting was pretty easy, and the best part is that I'm no longer fighting the wire.In a lot of mouse or peripheral reviews in general, the writer will say something like \"Will this thing make you a better player? No!\"However, in the case of the Kone Pro Air, I do think it has made me better. I just got out of a Modern Warfare 3 2-hour session of Shipment/Rust and I can perceptibly feel that my tracking and flicking has gotten faster, smoother, and more accurate. You really don't understand how much a mouse wire can bog you down until you go without one for a few weeks. And I had been using a mouse bungee too. I held out on buying a wireless mouse because I was always skeptical of latency, but this mouse is IMMEDIATE over a 2.4ghz WiFi network.Lighting is a little understated as it only shows up under the two main mouse buttons instead of around the whole mouse (like many Roccat mice), but it looks good.Only couple caveats I'll mention here are that Swarm is pretty buggy and the initial pairing process was a little cumbersome. Swarm will show the mouse charged to 100% and display \"4 hours remaining.\" There is also no way to stop the mouse from turning the RGB off after a minute of it being idle (I made sure to turn power saving mode off). And when I got the mouse I had to do a little 20 minute song and dance or plugging the mouse in, hitting the pair button on the dongle, unplugging it, etc. Eventually I got there and I've zero problems since (and I use a KVM switch), but I thought that was worth mentioning.The Owl Eye sensor is spot on and the PTFE feet glide super smoothly over my Skypad 3.0 (glass mousepad). Roccat also includes a spare set of feet, which I thought was a nice touch.Overall, I am very pleased. If you have tried other Kone mice and want to make the jump to wireless, you should be very happy with the Kone Pro Air.",
