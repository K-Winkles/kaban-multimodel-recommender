The sensor is just sensitive enough without it being crazy and moving all over the screen at the slightest touch. She hasn't had to recharge it since she received it on Xmas Eve and she uses it for several hours daily. Very nice mouse. Beautiful colors and nice color options to choose from. It's sleek in design (she has skinny hands) and light in weight. Very pretty to look at. Great purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Only lasted a little less than a month",
                "reviewText": "I ordered this about a month ago because the previous mouse I had broke and I needed one for work and such asap. I have prime so I figured I could just order one and get it quickly problem solved. I didn't want to spend a whole lot on one that was just one I figured would be temporary and figured it would last for a few months. I had a similar one before that lasted around 4 months or so and I figured this would be the same. It looked nice and the packaging was easy to open, I liked the look of it but I honestly prefer a one that's more curved inwards on the side for holding it as my previous one was more comfortable. That is more of a personal preference though, otherwise it worked well for me the charge lasted about 3 days or so for me which I loved. The issue was about a week or two ago when I was using the mouse I noticed it was harder for me to move my cursor and click things. I figured I might've accidentally hit a setting on my laptop as that's happened to me before, however that wasn't the case. I didn't have any other laptop or computer to test the mouse with and I figured that maybe it needed to be charged and when I charged it, the problem went away. However as I kept using it after that I noticed the problem was there unless it was plugged in. I used it for a bit while plugged in but the way my laptop is set up along with my desk it was a bit annoying to use it while it was plugged in. One day about a week or two ago I went to go use it and I picked it up off my desk because I was straightening my mousepad when the top half of it just completely fell off. The ring where it lights up as well as the top black part above it pulled off from about halfway down and I realized it was only still attached because of how the front was attached. As far as I'm aware it didn't fall on the floor and I haven't really moved it from my desk except maybe once or twice to clean up my desk. I'm the only one that used it and I assume because of it's price it is a bit cheaply made and that's why it essentially has fallen apart. After attempting to use it a bit more I realized it being hard to use was due to it already being apart and I simply never realized this prior. Since it wasn't much and it's been about a month I figured there's no point in trying to get my money back when I can simply find a better one for more that will actually last longer. I've had a cheaper one than this that lasted longer however I can't find it here on Amazon so I assume they don't sell it anymore for whatever reason. I still use the mouse I just have to hold onto it tightly while I use it so it works better and doesn't come apart. It looks nice and if it lasted longer I would've gave a better review however as is I believe if you're looking for a cheap mouse because you don't have the money or you need a temp one, I would suggest either investing a better one for more or look around on here for a better one.",

Las luces de colores led no se pueden programar o dejar fijos, van haciendo una transici\u00f3n de forma autom\u00e1tica.Trae un bot\u00f3n para modificar la sensibilidad del mouse (3 opciones de DPI).El mouse se apaga a los 10 minutos de no utilizarlo lo que me parece muy bien para el ahorro de bater\u00eda (es recargable, tard\u00f3 unas 2 o 3 horas en cargarse la primera vez). Como es nuevo a\u00fan no puedo comentar la duraci\u00f3n de la carga, pero hasta el momento lo recomiendo!",
