                "reviewText": "This is one of those products that's just made simple, but really good because it's simple. The clicking mechanism is so awesome on the mouse buttons, I don't think I could ever go back to an old-school sharp \"click\" as most mice make. You don't notice how the sound of the \"click\" of your mouse is to your total overall concentration while working on the computer, until you switch to this gel-like soft sound click. Can't go back to an old mouse click after getting used to this one. The mouse just works exactly as it should, ergonomics are great, precision of the optics underneath are solid. Just great all around. The only thing I can criticize it for is the feeling of the wheel is a bit more loose and less precision than I'm used to in more expensive mice, but the scroll wheel is not a make or break it at this price point. If they were to come up with a revision to this mouse where the scroll wheel has a bit more weighted and rotational mechanical precision to it, it would be a perfect mouse. Still, almost perfect for what it is, is good enough.",

The mouse lays comfortably flatter than the hump on many also allowing me to move faster on the mousepad. It is quiet and precise. It is light and not clunky. It is very well made and priced. This is a winner for me. (along with the Macally keyboard in my next review). Shipped very fast via Prime, received in three days.",

                "reviewText": "My Apple Magic Mouse was giving me constant problems, apparently due to Bluetooth signal interference from some of my peripherals. I also found it rather annoying to have to recharge it periodically. Thus I was looking for a hard-wired USB mouse and this seemed to fit the bill. It works fine, was simple to set up (plug and play, no configuration or additional software required) but is a little small for my medium-sized hand, which results in some discomfort when I use it for long photo editing sessions with lots of mouse interaction.",

                "reviewText": "As another reviewer mentioned, my mouse also came with a button popped up, but it was easily fixed by just pressing back it down.And another mentioned the way the click feels, that it was almost gel-like. It feels more to me like how when I was a kid, we would pop the Snapple lids from the glass bottles. They have a pop-up seal that we would push hard enough to kind of stretch out. Then, you could pop it down (loudly) and it would pop back up on its own. It was quite popular for both the sound and feel.But this mouse IS SILENT. I was showing it off to a coworker, and she could not hear it while standing right next to me.The scroll wheel feels great to me, too. It's exactly what I hoped for. I can't stand the feeling of each roll having a deep pothole I bottom out in to slow me down. This rolls light & quick. It really does feel like the difference between driving over never ending speed bumps vs driving over a gravel road.I would like it a tad heavier. Possibly a little bigger. I wish they had different styles to choose from.",

Kinda pretty to look at but when you get down to it overpriced crap for the most part. I got it for free by working with a outfit that did customer support for apple. I did not last long at that job but I appreciated the free apple keyboard and mouse which I am actually using the keyboard now but the mouse crapped out like I said.But my requirements for a mouse is to be able to function in less then sterile environment where allot of ash collects and whatnot.So far it working great and has the feel of sturdiness which is what I seek.And I think it has all the buttons and wheels apple uses these days but I have not bother to figure out how to use all of them.And I still get by thanks to the mouse.",
