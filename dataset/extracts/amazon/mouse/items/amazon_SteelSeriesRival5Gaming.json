                "reviewText": "Update: I was able to get a replacement mouse, I will not be using the included batteries this time! It's a great mouse otherwise. I have been really happy with both SteelSeries mouses that I have used, both this Rival and also the Prime. I picked the Rival for wireless due to the dual mode choice of either using bluetooth OR the included dongle. The wireless version of the Prime seemed to only have the dongle option. I pair the bluetooth to my laptop and plug the dongle into my desktop for quick and easy switching.Original review: I was really liking this mouse, the dual wireless modes were great. One day I went to use it and it didn't work. I normally ONLY use high end lithium batteries since old fashioned alkaline batteries always explode or leak. I had used the included batteries in a pinch and sure enough, they had exploded, ruining the mouse. Don't use the included batteries.",

                "reviewText": "I am new to PC gaming. Already had the steel series, keyboard and pro headset. I was using a wired razor mouse. There was something about it. I didn't like the wire but I didn't know the other things that were wrong with it until I used this mouse today. The steel series wireless mouse has a much different feel to it. It has a little bit of weight which I'm now figuring out I needed. It also has this metallic feel and it just feels very sure of itself. It feels like a professional mouse which is how the keyboard feels. And the headset for that matter. But I had no idea this mouse would improve things for me so much. Like I said, it's a mixture of how it feels the way it fits in your hand. The weight behind it makes me understand how much I'm moving the mouse versus something with no weight. I'm in love with this mouse and my other steel series stuff. I will stick with this company as long as they keep making stuff like this. I didn't know how much my other mouse was. Annoying me but this thing feels right at home.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great mouse, but i personally believe that its predecessor (the Rival 600) is a better quality mouse. the Rival 5 feels like its made out of cheaper plastic, the cord feels cheaper and is permanently attached. the Rival 600 has a sort of soft-touch coating that doesn\u2019t feel like plain cheap plastic, it has nice rubber grips, the aesthetics are nicer, they offer different weight settings, the cord is detachable, the packaging is nicer, it just really overall feels like a more premium mouse and seems more well thought out and manufactured. with that being said, i think the shape of the rival 5 is slightly nicer, and i like the addition of the toggle buttons on the side, but other than that it simply feels cheaper and seems like it should be the predecessor instead of the successor. i personally decided to stick with the rival 5 because it fits within my hand better with how my pc is setup. and it is very similar to the rival 600, i don\u2019t mean for this review to sound like the rival 5 is a bad mouse or is poor quality by any means because it\u2019s definitely a really really good product and ultimately you can\u2019t go wrong either way, but i do think that overall the rival 600 is a NICER mouse for the money.",

The quick story is - by far my favorite mouse I've ever used!Detailed story -- I'm way older now and lost count of how many mouses I bought over the years, put it this way, I started playing Diablo when it first came out. So that gives you an idea of how many mouses I've been through, mostly stuck with logitech, but many other off brands too, and was always eyeballing the steelseries, and almost bought one last round but then I found some crazy cheap deal and decided to go with it, Boy am I kicking myself in the behind now, and thank you for the price drop, because this mouse feels like it was custom made for me. Keep in mind I'm average size person 6ft 190ibs average size hands I guess we can say, and as you can see in the pic it's my perfect hand size....perfecttttoooo! And I know I'm in a treehouse and using it on a barstool, but I've had a 100 mouses and none fit this perfect, feel so solid, with buttons that quietly give a perfect push and feedback, I've played with my buddies that pay crazy prices that I would never consider paying just to save a few grams....and I still like this one way better! All I can say is sorry steelseries, I wish I went with ya sooner, but we're connected now and I'll be a loyal fan. OHHH wait wait wait, I was so excited about that perfect fit, how could I forget to mention how freaking cool this lil light show is at night up in the tree-house, there again not overkill just perfect cool looking display! Thanks much steelseries for so much excitement in a mouse...HAAAA! CHEERS MATES!!!PS: YES, I would recommend this mouse! )",

El mouse precio - rendimiento por excelencia.Los materiales son ligeros y cabe bien en manos medianas. Generalmente lo uso en agarre de palma. Es muy comodo.Me hubiese gustado por el precio que el cable fuera mallado, sin embargo, el cable es de buena calidad y es mas flexible, sore todo si se tiene algo que pueda estorbarlo al moverlo.Recomendado como primer mouse gamer. \u2728",
