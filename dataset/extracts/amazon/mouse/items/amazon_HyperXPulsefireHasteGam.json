                "reviewText": "So I bought the Razer Viper when it was first released. I loved the Viper and still do. A bit of a back story, I prefer lightweight mice because I tend to get RSI episodes after prolonged use of mice (at work/games). The Razer adder is by far the most comfortable mouse I\u2019ve used, but its hefty weight almost caused me to quit gaming. Tried a vertical mouse and a whole bunch of ergo mice but to no avail. My RSI symptoms persisted. Once the Razer viper was released I bought as a last ditch effort ... and to my surprise it worked. I was able to game without any RSI symptoms. Two years later I was In search for a lighter mouse and I tried the Glorious D.... and while it was more comfortable to hold (bigger) and it was lighter, the glorious felt cheap and its buttons were too mushy for my liking. A few months later I try the Haste. And by far this mouse is superior to both the Viper and Glorious. Quality of build is excellent. The mouse is rigid and less heavy than the viper (very noticeable). But what sold me on this mouse was the quality of the left/right click buttons. They are crisp and responsive without being too sensitive. The cord is way more flexible than that of the Viper\u2019s. Only con is that the scroll wheel (front/back) are not programmable. Also, the mouse much like the Viper is on the small side. Unless you are use to mice this size or have small hands, it will take some to to get use to mice this size. However, most lightweight mice under 60 grams will be about the same size (with a few exceptions).With that said, wish they added a few more buttons and made a larger mouse without compromising the weight too much.Would buy again. This my is by far the best mouse for the buck and is better than most higher priced mice.",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019ve had quite a few different \u201cgaming\u201d mice in my time. I\u2019ve had a few Corsair, and even a few different versions of Finalmouse. But I decided to take a chance on this HyperX mouse now that my previous favorite \u201cFinalmouse\u201d, has gotten way too expensive for me to justify the purchase.It\u2019s been I think 10 months or so since I bought the mouse, and it still functions exactly as the day I bought it. One thing I had a problem with other brands was the middle mouse button breaking on me after about 6 months of use, but this one feels solid and is still in working order.I\u2019m also a huge fan of the lightweight honey comb feature, which also helps prevent your hand from sweating during extended gaming sessions. The program used to customize the lighting and set the DPI is very easy to use. I also like that it has different color codings for each DPI cycle. The size is also just right, I have medium-large hands, and it fits nice and comfortably in my hand.This is definitely a must-have mouse, and if it ever fails me, I will 100% buy another.",

                "reviewText": "There's no mouse to rival the Haste at this price point. While many would consider this a budget mouse, it doesn't perform like one or feel like one. TTC switches are loud and clicky (very satisfying sound), scroll wheel is silent, there's no rattling when shaken, no creaking when gripped firmly, and the stock cable was surprisingly good. Not XM1r good, but close. You also get an extra set of skates, which glide very well and aren't thin like some other stock skates. Set of grips come in the box, too. Very nice looking and provide all the grip you want. Thumbs up for that.Don't be discouraged by the 3335 sensor. It performs good and we're at a point that sensors don't matter as much as comfort. My hand size is 18cm x 9.5cm and the Haste fits my hand well with a relaxed palm/fingertip grip. If you claw grip, I'd maybe look at something else. Side buttons could have been a bit bigger, protruded a bit more, and I don't like that HyperX chose to use a glossy plastic instead of the great feeling matte plastic the shell has (I'm nitpicking at this point, trying hard to find something not to like about this mouse).Is it the best mouse? No, but if you're ceiling is $50-60, get this mouse... period. There's nothing at this price point that is better. It's light (59g, 61g on my scale), performs well, comes with extras, and has unexpectedly good build quality for a mouse at this price point. The only other mouse that gives you this much value to price ratio would be the Viper Mini.",

                "reviewText": "Para responder o t\u00edtulo logo: SIM! Vale bastante a pena. Eu estou usando o mouse h\u00e1 2 dias e estou simplesmente amando. Testei em jogos r\u00e1pidos como League of Legends, Valorant e Overwatch, como em jogos mais tranquilos como World of Warcraft. Simplesmente 10/10 em todo quesito. Vou abordar uns t\u00f3picos para ficar mais f\u00e1cil a review. PESO: - O mouse \u00e9 realmente MUITO leve, eu at\u00e9 achei que teria problemas por ser leve demais, no entanto, ele \u00e9 um equil\u00edbrio perfeito. \u00c9 leve o suficiente para voc\u00ea ter capacidade de fazer movimentos r\u00e1pidos com o m\u00ednimo de esfor\u00e7o, ao mesmo tempo que n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 t\u00e3o leve ao ponto de voc\u00ea sentir que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 pegando em nada.PEGADA: - O mouse tem uma pegada \u00d3TIMA, minha m\u00e3o \u00e9 medio-grande (tenho 1,80.. acho que da para ter uma m\u00e9dia com minha altura, n\u00e3o sei), ent\u00e3o um mouse um pouco maior \u00e9 perfeito para mim. O mouse N\u00c3O escorrega em nenhum momento, mesmo com a minha m\u00e3o suando a todo momento! (n\u00e3o utilizei os adesivos que vem junto ao mouse)CLICK: - O clique do mouse \u00e9 bastante suave, meus tend\u00f5es agradecem e MUITO. N\u00e3o possuo tendinite diagnosticada, mas sinto dores no meu pulso ap\u00f3s um certo tempo jogando. Decidi comprar esse mouse mais leve para tentar evitar sentir dores, e foi a escolha certa! Para finalizar, o mouse em si \u00e9 \u00f3timo. Cabo LONGO, super resistente e de uma qualidade absurda. Eu pessoalmente tinha ficado meio desanimado ap\u00f3s ver que o produto possu\u00eda led apenas no Scroll (bolinha). Mas, depois percebi que n\u00e3o era necess\u00e1rio leds em outros lugares, j\u00e1 que a minha (nossa) m\u00e3o cobre a maior parte do mouse. O mouse promete somente o essencial, e entrega somente o essencial com EXCEL\u00caNCIA. N\u00e3o adicionaria, nem removeria absolutamente nada no mouse. Comprem, este mouse \u00e9 simplesmente perfeito para tudo, e todos... mesmo que voc\u00ea tenha tendinite e/ou hiperidrose palmar... esse mouse \u00e9 feito para VOC\u00ca!",
