I\u2019ve got to say this mouse is definitely one of the best bang for your buck.I bought this mouse to replace my Razer Basilisk Hyperspeed X. I like the Basilisk series because the shape of those mice really fit my hand well. This mouse has a more flat and round shape and, I\u2019m my opinion, is not that ergonomic. If you have big hands like me, the mouse may not be to comfortable at first. I got used to it after a few days of using the mouse.The side buttons feel cheap. You can press them in further than the actual button press. Has a weird squishy or springy feeling.The build quality is surprisingly good. The mouse has a nice eggshell type finish which feels smooth, but not glossy. The mouse feels pretty sturdy but I have yet to rage and see how much damage it can take. The mouse is somewhat lightweight coming in at 105g as far as I\u2019m aware but I don\u2019t really mind heavy mice. Definitely lighter than the Razer mouse I was using.TL:DR, Very good value! Great gaming that feels well built and responsive with some minor issues that you would expect for the price. Very good mouse if your on a budget or just need a cheap replacement.",
