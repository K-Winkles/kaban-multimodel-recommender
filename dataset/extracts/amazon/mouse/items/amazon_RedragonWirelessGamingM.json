However, there are a few drawbacks that prevent it from being a perfect mouse.One of the biggest drawbacks of the Redragon gaming mouse is its battery life. The mouse uses a rechargeable battery, but it only lasts for about 20 hours on a single charge. pretty much have to leave it charging every night.Another drawback of the Redragon gaming mouse is its RGB lighting. The RGB lighting is bright and colorful but the RGB lighting is not synced with other Redragon devices, such as the Redragon gaming keyboard.Despite these drawbacks, the Redragon gaming mouse is still a good choice for gamers on a budget.

Lo compr\u00e9 para usarlo en mi Mac y no puedo controlar el RGB desde ella, pero desde la Windows si.- Para el consumidor : Revisar en la pagina si el software del mouse funciona con tu sistema operativo.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse because I was looking at Redragon products after purchasing their keyboard k652 and loving the quality and features, just like the keyboard the mouse is full of things you did not know you needed. like connectivity = 3 BT devices, 2.4Ghz dongle that hides under the mouse and wired USB-C (by the way brings his own USB-C cable) I was skeptical as other Redragon products look more over the top gaming childish style but this mouse altho it does have its gaming looks, is more functional than gimmicky and the RBG is nice and can be changed via a button right by the DPI selector . I got for productivity more than gaming and is awesome as you can remap key and like me that use tons of copy/paste the rapid fire button is mapped to \"Select\" by default, making it easier to work also the weight and feel is great and the combo of materials smooth on top and grippy on the sides it makes up for a good experience.",

I have been really enjoying using this computer mouse, in both the wireless and wired modes.I do have to admit I use it in the wired mode much more than in wireless just because I find it to be more responsive to my movements while gaming rather than with the receiver plugged in.It\u2019s a great idea to have the receiver in the base of the mouse, I definitely would\u2019ve lost it by now if it wasn\u2019t attached to it. Such a good idea.It comes with a cool little sticker sheet which I thought was a nice addition, I\u2019ve modified a few of my stands now with them and they all match nicely.All led lights in the mouse are low power so I haven\u2019t experienced them getting hot or effecting the use of the mouse. All instructions are clear and have helped me understand the different ways I can have the lights flowing and what each different button does on the mouse too.",
