                "reviewText": "I wanted a simple mouse... what I thought were easy requirements: Bluetooth (I did not want a dongle), side buttons (I use a third party driver where I can program them how I want in each app), fairly ergonomically. Decent weight, a good \"click\" feel, and a quality feel to the plastic were definite plusses.I tried multiple other much more expensive mice. They had BT but it did not work well. The buttons felt cheap. Its \"added\" features made my third party driver not work well.This mouse... bought almost in desperation. Did not expect much but figured it was cheaper and I could return it if needed. No need. It is almost perfect. The BT works great and as it should, the side buttons are well placed, it was easy to set up with my third party software, the clicks are almost perfect (I might like a bit quieter, but I am noise sensitive... they are not uncommonly loud). The scroll wheel has a good feel and is smooth. I might want a slightly larger mouse, but I use this for travel so the smaller size has a benefit there, too... and it is not really small, I am just used to a larger than common size. The settings are well placed (on the bottom) and there is a switch instead of a button to cycle through modes (this is so much better). The dongle is held securely in the battery compartment.I do wonder if the battery compartment door will hold up... but how often do you need to open that and it is not really bad, just not as sturdy as some (but better than many others).All in all -- a really good value for the money.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly great mouse, highly recommend, especially for Linux folks",
                "reviewText": "I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews on Amazon, but after having a frustrating couple years' experience with mice (mouses?), i felt compelled to get on here and express how happy i am with this one. I've owned many mice over the years, normally i buy Targus or Logitech if I can. Targus used to make a really nice one with an optical top-side scroll that allowed you to scroll not only up or down but left and right too, that may have been my all-time favorite up 'til now, but they no longer make it. It died several years ago, and since i've gone through many. They never seem to last more than a year or two; it seems sooner or later the main click button wears out or they just stop responding like a power issue, and they need to be replaced. Many times, especially if you use a Mac or use Linux, they just won't work at all, compatibility issues. I've tried a couple Logitech mice the last few times, they seem to be the premier company in the mouse market, so you'd think they'd be good quality. Had a Logitech Pebble, stopped working literally a year and a day after I bought it (also happened to be right after the warranty expired...interesting.) Also disconnected frequently (several times a day), and took some hassle to re-connect. Bought a same model replacement at a Target where Logitech was the only brand they had and the Pebble was the best (and priciest, at $29.99) they had in stock. This time, it worked for about 30 seconds before it too \"died\", leaving me mouseless again until i could go back to Target to return it. Major inconvenience to say the least, considering that buying a mouse was the 1 and only reason for the original Target visit in the first place. The girl who processed the return asked me no questions about the return, even though I'd already cut open the package, which suggested to me that was not the first time she'd seen people return a defective Logitech mouse. Needless to say, i'm done with Logitech. The other thing about the Logitech mouse, it never seemed to wake up one of my machines, even if the laptop had just fallen asleep. I was always having to re-connect it too. I had just started using Linux around the time i got that, and i always assumed it was a compatibility issue, and had shrugged it off as a pitfall of Linux. Same with another \"off-brand\" mouse I had used, though that one was the only one I ever had that seemed to connect seamlessly with Linux over Bluetooth (I've found that you usually have to use the USB piece to use a wireless mouse with Linux, Bluetooth seems to be a problem, at least with mice). Not to write a hate-spiel about Logitech here, but it aggravates me greatly that their mice don't work well, especially with their reputation and the price of their stuff. It's like, i live in the richest, most powerful nation in the world, in the most technologically advanced era in history, and i can't get a decent ^#$%ing wireless mouse that will actually work longer than a year!? What does a guy have to do to get a freakin' mouse that works these days?Anyway, I bought this one due to the high ratings, features, and most options for compatibility and connections. Had it maybe a month or two, so i can't comment yet on it's long-term durability. But, it has been life-changing so far. I was skeptical that it would even work, but it does, and it works far better than any other mouse i've had since that Targus of long ago. And it's about half the price of Logitech mice. This mouse will wake up my Linux laptop from the other room, the next day after it's been \"asleep\" overnight. It turns out Linux isn't the problem; the problem was that the other mice i had and their wireless signal were too weak. This one is also nicely designed, with a more comfortable and ergonomic fit for my hand than a Pebble's small, shallow shape, and i have relatively small hands. I can quickly and easily switch between control of two computers by switching the connectivity switch on the bottom from Bluetooth to USB adaptor or vice-versa. The Pebble could sort-of do that too, if both laptops were \"awake\", but this one is far more reliable, and is powerful enough to wake up the asleep machine, which Logitech mice can't. Mice are simple devices in principle, easy to take for granted. But in this age where apparently mouse companies apparently either can't build one that that works very well for very long, or don't feel it's in their interests to do so, Tecknet is a godsend. It also comes in a simple, environmentally-considerate cardboard box, which happily proclaims \"frustration-free packaging\". Well-done, Shenzhen! No scissor-destroying, aggravating, potentially dangerous cutting open of plastic blister-packaging of questionable recyclability. I wish more American companies would take this kind of approach.Room for improvement? Well, the mouse seems to occasionally disconnect randomly from my MacOS-running laptop (I use Bluetooth connection for that one), but it doesn't happen that often, and usually self-corrects after a couple seconds and a bit of mouse-jiggling. There's a thin toggle-button built onto the left side of the gripping area which function as back- and forward- buttons you can activate with a squeeze of your thumb for web browsers. Takes a little getting used to, and it's easy to accidentally click those and switch pages when doing web-surfing, but can actually come in handy when you're used to it and feeling extra-lazy, so I have mixed feelings about that. If you're left-handed though, this is not an optimal placement, and I think lefties will either accidentally click more than righties, or will feel this isn't really \"available\" to them, as it may take a rather awkward maneuvering of the ring-finger to use. Also, there are quite a few buttons and switches on this mouse, so you really do have to read the manual to get this thing going, and you'll probably have to consult it again from time to time, as i have. All that said, it's an incredible relief to finally have a well-functioning, reliable, high-performance multi-platform wireless mouse that plays well with Linux and MacOS, and that alone gives me reason to rate this at five stars.",

It'd be nice to be able to plug the 2.4G dongle into whatever computer and have it work immediately and flawlessly the way the BT mode does.",
