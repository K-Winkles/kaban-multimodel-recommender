It's really awesome that it comes with bluetooth mode and 2.4ghz mode. I use my desktop to watch movies, and i do work on my laptop. I have the mouse connected to my desktop via bluetooth, and the 2.4ghz receiver in my laptop. All you have to do is press the button on the bottom to switch modes. It takes about 3-5 seconds to go from my laptop to my desktop so it's very quick. It is smaller than I wanted, but all in all it is a great mouse",

                "reviewText": "I wanted an extra mouse to keep because I find myself needing one a lot of times when I don't seem to have one. I tried this out and haven't touched it a whole lot since. The issue is that it's just way too small for the average adult male hand. I would say my hands are slightly smaller than average, and still it's not the most comfortable feel. It definitely makes the mouse more portable, and I could see myself using this for work settings. However, for gaming or average use, I would definitely prefer a bigger mouse that comfortably fits my hand. The battery life is great for the mouse, and it slides across the desk well and has appropriate features that the average mouse would have.To reiterate, the mouse works great, and is perfect for individuals who travel a lot and struggle to store a mouse in their bag. The adapter connects and the mouse works instantly, and there are not issues with battery, connection, durability, etc. For comfort, I would explore other options. Otherwise, look no further than this mouse as it's incredibly affordable!!",
