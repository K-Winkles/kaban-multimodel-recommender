                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a fine, inexpensive wireless mouse. Nothing wrong fancy but also nothing to complain about. The battery lasts long in on one charge. I have only had it for a couple of months and I\u2019ve charged it twice. It charges easily.One nice feature is that when you aren\u2019t using it, there is a switch on the bottom to turn it off. This saves battery power. If you don\u2019t turn it off between sessions, it will go to sleep in five or ten minutes, but the battery will drain a little still in sleep mode. So I try to remember to flip it over and flick the switch to off.I\u2019m glad I purchased it. Not for high-end gaming performance but for everyday office use of my laptop.",
