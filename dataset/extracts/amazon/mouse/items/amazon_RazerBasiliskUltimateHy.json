                "reviewText": "I ordered this mouse in as it was the same design as the G502 that I very much enjoyed, but I wanted to keep my peripherals matched with my other Razer products, as well as my recent experience with the \"updated\" Logitech G Hub app was VERY frustrating and not enjoyable. I use this both for work and play at home for many games.The design itself is great and feels very nice to use with my preferred fingertip/claw grip. The biggest complaints about the mouse fall into this field for me though as I very much miss the 2 buttons on the left mouse button that are present in the G502, but are missing in this rendition, however this is not to be faulted against Razer as that is a different mouse, just something I'd love to see. The other complaint is the removable thumb paddle which is very short and difficult to reach without readjusting your grip. The last minor complaint is that the underside compartment where the USB dongle can be stored is a very cheap plastic door that I can see breaking or becoming lost after extended use. It would have been nice to see a more stable hinged or sliding door to house the USB when traveling. Aside from that, the buttons feel responsive and pleasant, and the scroll wheel resistance settings are much more preferred rather than just tactile or free spin. The mouse feels light and sturdy enough that I don't ever find myself thinking it feels cheap, and the grip texture along the sides of the mouse is comfortable and doesn't appear to be wearing off so far.As for the functionality of the mouse, the connection speed and response time is incredible! The mouse reacts as fast as a wired mouse with no hiccups that I've encountered so far. The 20k DPI is ridiculous to say the least and I could never see it being used by myself, but it's fun to see the point scream across my monitors at a mere jostle of the mouse. The battery life of my mouse when I first received it was dismal at best and I was very disappointed to see the battery life drop from ~90% to ~60% after sitting on my desk TURNED OFF for a few hours. I charged to full a few times and was still encountering the issue, so I reached out to Razer Support. They provided me a firmware update file, something that I thought the Synapse app would have done, and after following the instructions to update the mouse, it has been night and day difference! Now my mouse lasts MUCH longer even when left on, with a sleep timer set, while having the RGB brightness set to 30%. Between going from work to home, I use this thing for upwards of 12hrs a day and I can last about 3-4 days before needing to charge.Overall, I very much enjoy this mouse after the Firmware Update was applied and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the feel/style of the Logitech G502, but want to try out something different. I would love to compare the wireless G502 to this one, but I don't have the pocket money to do that. So take this review as simply a review of the mouse and G502 \"fashion\" comparison.",

                "reviewTitle": "First Impressions - Solid Gaming mouse",
                "reviewText": "I needed a replacement for my G502 proteus core which i've had since 2015 or so, I really needed a mouse with a similar button layout, specifically a thumb button as well since I use that alot for VOIP push to talk and I'm way too used to it. I have a g502 hero mouse too but the double clicking issue with logi has gone beyond belief at this point and I just can't risk buying another set of mice like it (I already RMA'd the hero mouse once) just failing with switches over and over, it wastes my time far too much. Granted, my old proteus core is still kicking but I needed another mouse for work as well. The basilisk so far, first day of use, these are my impressions:**The GOOD GOOD**:-Small-Lightweight (compared to g502)-Resistance levels are adjustable for the scroll wheel-Razer software allows on board memory usage as well, I don't really have complaints with Synapse.-Thumb button is fantastic, feels fantastic-Side buttons feel alright, I do like the feel of the G502 better but they're fine.***The not so good good***- Seems like the battery life might not be 100hrs as advertised, 1.5 hours of use drained almost 12% already though it is not in low power mode. This might not be ideal for long extended 15-18 hour gaming sessions which I really don't do anymore unless I'm on holidays or something, I'm testing the low power mode and will report again eventually.-no other issues observed yet.Overall:Well, I can't really complain, it's wireless, it feels good, it's responsive even in low power mode right now, the dock is magnetic so it's extremely easy to just latch on and leave (very big bonus). The thumb button is removable but it also feels fantastic as button concept is far superior to what the G502 had.Time will tell if the mouse holds up to my old logitech treasure, my initial experience with a Razer Naga over 10 years ago was absolutely traumatizing, the thing maybe lasted 6 months between double clicking issues and eventually the sensor just dying on me. This new Basilisk + the Synapse software seem to have redeemed my praise for Razer, they've come a long way but again, time will tell. If you see this mouse on sale, at least based on these first impressions, I'd say buy it with the dock. (it's currently $120 on Amazon US with the dock included which is why I purchased it).**Update April 30th**Only 2 days of use now, I realized my battery was draining over 10% an hour with 33% brightness on RGB and 1000 polling rate. I dropped the RGB lighting to 0 on the mouse and polling rate to 500 hz, now it's about 1% per hour of gaming time so it seems to be falling in line with the 100hrs of use at that point (note, this is not in low power mode which I haven't really tested well yet). I preemptively put a ticket in with Razer to see if I had a dud or not initially but it seems like if this actually holds at 1% per hour in current settings, it's plenty, i throw it on the dock over night anyways but at this rate it can last 4-5 days of playing without a charging it which is quite impressive.Update after a couple weeks of use:I'm very happy with this mouse, it is certainly extremely customizable. I previously mentioned I managed to get the battery life alot higher. Now after a full day of gaming, 15hrs + I'm barely even getting to like 81-85% battery which is fantastic. Charging it so mindless with the dock that I don't think anyone will ever worry about it. Overall my only complaint is that the clicking feels a bit wobbly, my logitech mice clicks are generally very firm and there's no movement of the click buttons side to side whatsoever, but otherwise, the mouse itself is fantastic, extremely comfortable and again the closest thing I could get to a g502, the scroll wheel has a nice feel, the rest of the button feels very good with each click feeling fantastic.",

                "reviewText": "Despu\u00e9s de haber utilizado este mouse algunas semanas para jugar videojuegos intensos como BF5, Cyberpunk 2077 y, especialmente, los Sims 4, puedo concluir que nunca hab\u00eda usado un mouse m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo que este. Es simplemente perfecto para mis manos y mis requisitos.S\u00ed, el precio puede ser bastante elevado comparado con la competencia pero al usarlo un par de veces en tus juegos preferidos, te das cuenta que de en verdad vale la pena y el precio es justificable.El control que proporciona este rat\u00f3n es estupendo, la rueda tiene una sensaci\u00f3n extra\u00f1a pero satisfactoria, los botones laterales son bastante \u00fatiles, el RGB es excelente, se ve muy elegante pero a la vez extravagante cuando lo enciendes, y la base de carga es un toque magn\u00edfico, carga bastante r\u00e1pido el mouse (\u00a1y tambi\u00e9n tiene RGB! El futuro es hoy).Otro dato importante es la bater\u00eda. F\u00e1cilmente me dura un par de d\u00edas de uso sin que se agote la carga y aunque se agote, el tiempo de carga es m\u00ednimo.Razer synapse no es un dolor de cabeza como las dem\u00e1s personas dicen, al menos en mi experiencia. Ser\u00eda padre poder usar el mouse sin Synapse pero realmente no hay ning\u00fan inconveniente substancial como para quejarme de la aplicaci\u00f3n. Es bastante \u00fatil en ciertas ocasiones.En general, le doy un 10 a este mouse razer. S\u00faper c\u00f3modo, preciso y ligero, y perfecto para cualquier jugador que necesite un mouse completo para todo tipo de juego.Nota: mis manos son relativamente peque\u00f1as. Miden aproximadamente 18 cent\u00edmetros de la punta de mi dedo del medio hasta la base de mi mu\u00f1eca, y 7.5 cent\u00edmetros de ancho (la base de los dedos) y sent\u00ed el mouse muy c\u00f3modo.",
