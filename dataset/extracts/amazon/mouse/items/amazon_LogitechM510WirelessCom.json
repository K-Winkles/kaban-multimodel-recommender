                "reviewText": "Having wasted many dollars on Microsoft Bluetooth mice that needed to be re-paired every time I started the computer, I settled on this Logitech series of wireless mice that use a simple, tiny wireless receiver that ALWAYS works, regardless of computer.The first model I bought was the Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX . It's more designed for portability and I use it on my laptops because it stores the receiver in the mouse itself and has a large convenient on/off slide switch that covers the laser when not in use. It also has a little zipper pouch for safe protected transport. Its only downside is that it's a bit small for my hands. Good for portability, slightly small for hands.This M510 is larger, does not store the same tiny unified receiver, and does not have a zipper storage pouch. It's designed for permanent desktop use. It does have a small on/off switch on the bottom. When you first turn it on, a green LED lights on top, then goes out after a few seconds. There is no visible laser coming out the bottom. It runs on two included AA cells.The Logitech keyboard/mouse software allows a lot of customization. All the button functions are changeable via the Logitech software.One of the great features of both the Anywhere mouse and this M510 is the tilting wheel that allows for horizontal scrolling. Roll the wheel, it goes up and down. Tilt the wheel left or right and it scrolls left or right. Great for web windows that are larger than your screen magnification. I got so used to this feature on my laptop that I needed to get a new mouse for my desktops and the M510 fit the bill.If you press/click the wheel down, the software goes into autoscroll mode. Depending on the window, the autoscroll may go only up and down or in all four directions. Click again or click the left mouse button and you're back to normal.This M510 is definitely a \"righthanders\" mouse as the Forward/Back button are on the left side above the right thumb. It is just the right size and is very comfortable to use, gliding effortlessly on my mousepad, tracking reliably and never losing connection. Whatever RF or other wireless connection Logitech uses, it works great. The receiver is so small it's almost invisible. Little larger than the silver metal end of a USB plug. (By comparison the MS Bluetooth receiver was about 2\" long and it wasn't long before the thing was broken off in my laptop. Way too big, not to mention unreliable. And it wore out the USB socket to boot.)I was a bit concerned about the wireless receiver being recognized by my KVM switch that allows me to control two computers with one keyboard and mouse, but it's as reliable and seamless as my original corded Microsoft mouse.One of my complaints about the Microsoft mouse was that the back button on the side was so sensitive that I would inadvertently hit it moving from the keyboard to the mouse, sometimes dumping my input. This M510 has the buttons just right. They're small and you have to find them on purpose to activate them, but they're right where they need to be and have enough resistance that they don't get actuated accidentally.The mouse is very \"grippable\" and is very comfortable to use. My old Microsoft mouse was all plastic with no rubber, very slippery and hard to grip. And of course it was corded. It's amazing how \"freeing\" the lack of a cord is. The mouse is just \"there\" and not tangling on anything.Overall, a great mouse. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "I've never had an ergonomic mouse before, and I've had this for a few days now. The Logitech M510 feels great in my hand, not too big and not too small, plus the sides have indents to rest my fingers (hence the ergonomics I guess!). The mouse is decently heavy thanks to the 2 AA batteries, which is a plus for me at least. There's no lag as far as I can tell. The left click is very quiet and the right click is noticeably louder. The scroll wheel works good too, although in the beginning it felt a bit weird because I could feel the springs or something inside moving, but that went away. Lastly, I'm not much of a gamer - at least when it comes to FPS games can stuff like that - so I can only vouch for this working great for games like Stardew Valley and PvZ lol. Overall, great mouse for a great price! Hopefully it lasts long",

                "reviewText": "I've tried to save a little money in the past by purchasing cheaper mouses that had good reviews but they die or become too frustrating to use after a few months due to shoddy craftsmanship and poor engineering. This mouse is a huge breath of fresh air.Some reviews have mentioned concerns about the weight of this mouse. Personally, I think it's great. You can use one battery or two so there is some control over weight which is nice. I love the feel of this thing. It's not so light that it feels like you can crumple it in your hand. It feels solid and is really a quality piece of equipment.Normally I cringe at power saving features since they can shut the mouse down after a period of time and require you to click it to activate it again sending you to pages/files on your computer that the cursor happened to be sitting on that you don't want to go to etc. In short, they're usually more of a hassle than their worth. Not the case with this mouse. It does shut itself down after some time but all you do is move it and it's going again. It doesn't have a noticeable delay, it just works exactly the way you want it to. That and it has a ridiculously long battery expectancy of 2 years. This was something that concerned me because I wondered if it would decrease the sensitivity and accuracy but it's all fantastic. No reason to be concerned at all.Finally, the back and forward buttons are crisp and work great. The mouse contours very well to my hand and feels comfortable. The up and down scrolling is smooth and accurate and the side to side scroll feature is just as good. A simple software download from their site allows you to customize functions to your liking.I registered the mouse and got an extra 6 months of warranty totaling 2 1/2 years. If you decide you don't like it, they have a 100% money back 30 day trial. Two good indications you're dealing with a good company and a quality product. It's really nice to be able to say there's nothing I don't like and I highly recommend this product to everyone.",

                "reviewText": "La calidad superior de este producto es evidente en cada detalle: desde su dise\u00f1o ergon\u00f3mico, que minimiza la fatiga durante el uso prolongado, hasta su precisi\u00f3n y sensibilidad, que me permiten trabajar con rapidez y eficiencia. Adem\u00e1s, su robusta construcci\u00f3n asegura que este mouse durar\u00e1 mucho tiempo, a pesar del uso intensivo. Personalmente, no puedo imaginar volver a un mouse de menor calidad despu\u00e9s de experimentar el alto rendimiento del mouse Logitech. Lo recomiendo encarecidamente a cualquier persona que busque mejorar su interacci\u00f3n con la computadora.",

                "reviewText": "O mouse tem um bom tamanho, sendo confort\u00e1vel na m\u00e3o, \u00e9 bem constru\u00eddo e tem boa dura\u00e7\u00e3o de bateria (estou utilizando desde faz mais de 4 meses por pelo menos 8h por dia com a pilha que veio junto).A parte \u00f3tica n\u00e3o tem luz vis\u00edvel, ent\u00e3o para ver se est\u00e1 ligado tem que olhar no bot\u00e3o ou, depois de n\u00e3o ficar parado alguns minutos, ele liga o led verde na parte superior.Os bot\u00f5es adicionais s\u00e3o muito \u00fateis, mas para melhor uso \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio buscar um programa externo para mapear esses bot\u00f5es (laterais e empurrar a roda do mouse para esquerda ou direita). A ergonomia dos bot\u00f5es \u00e9 boa, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do lateral de tr\u00e1s, que \u00e9 o mais dif\u00edcil de pressionar.Quanto a sensibilidade, poderia ser maior em alguns momentos e ter a possibilidade de ajuste, mas os 1000DPI s\u00e3o suficientes na maior parte do tempo.O custo X benef\u00edcio \u00e9 excelente, considerando que tem mais fun\u00e7\u00f5es que a maior parte dos mouses sem fio na mesma faixa de pre\u00e7o, recomendo bastante principalmente para usar com notebook.",
