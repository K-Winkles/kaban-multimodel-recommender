                "reviewText": "This product is being used as my main desktop mouse for all purposes other than certain FPS which I like a light mouse for. In terms of standard or heavier mice, this one is one of the nicest ones I have ever used. It glides across my Razer mouse mat like ice. Extremely customizable for how it looks. Every feature is completely hidden, and very well at that. The back plate and front click plates come off to change weight and click switches respectively. Uses very nice custom designed click switches that are sold separately for replacement but you get 2 pairs with the mouse, so your first replacement is free. That is generally what goes bad on mice first, so this is basically when most would buy a new mouse, but now it is easy enough to fix you do not need a new one.In terms of specs, this is of the highest caliber as well. The 36k DPI sensor is the highest spec on the market and is the most capable of high performance gaming on the market competing with the dual sensor 12K DPI system of the Steelseries mice. Optical sensor so no problems with hair getting in there blocking a laser. Comes with plastic skates but they perform well. I have a feeling replacing these with ceramic or glass skates will make the mouse feel even more premium like my RAT8+. Overall the performance in games for me gets a 4/5 because the weights do not go low enough to get a true lightweight experience on the mouse.The build quality is a 5/5 though and the looks are an easy 4/5 or 5/5 depending on taste, if you like the looks anyways. I like RGB and you can turn it off. It does look a little basic without RGB, so that might be a 3/5. Armory crate is a mixed bag of an experience I am seeing, truly. I would not let the Armory crate dissuade anyone from getting this, unless they have a known interfering software like in some cases MSI Center and/or Corsair iCue.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a loyal Logitech fan for prolly 20 years. My 903 mouse recently started double clicking on a single click after 3 years, so I replaced it with the latest and greatest 502 X for gaming. Turns out the 502 X was super small and lightweight (which some people like (especially those with the claw style grip)).I do not like a claw style grip, and the 502 X gave me pretty bad hand cramps using it for more than twenty minutes.This Asus Spatha X fits my hand perfectly. I've included 3 photos for a compare and contrast between the Logitech G 502 X (on the right) and the Asus Spatha X (on the left).The little \"shelf\" on the Spatha allows my ring finger to rest on it, while my pinky drags on the mousepad. The 502 X was so small that my pinky would curl under my ring finger as it tried to find a natural resting place (this was very uncomfortable), while both pinky and ring finger would drag on the mousepad.I am not a paid reviewer, and I rarely post glowing reviews right out of the gate, but 10 minutes into this Asus Spatha X, and I am sold that this is my \"forever\" mouse. It is hefty (which I prefer), it fits my hand pretty ergonomically and naturally, I can actually access the thumb buttons without effort, and there were even two little replacement switches included in the box (incase it ever does begin the dreaded double click on a single click).A+ to the engineer(s) that designed this absolutely chonky Spatha X!",

                "reviewText": "ROG SPATHA X Review:I've use many mice before and this one is absolutely perfect for me. For starters, this thing is HUGE. Second, it's quite heavy, which(For me)is useful for precision. I can use it with ease in Modern Warfare 2, FortNite, etc.My only gripe with it is the side buttons. I can't tell you how many times I have gripped the mouse hard and accidentally pressed MB4 or MB5. The volume buttons are mapped by default to the mouse and would sometimes accidentally mute my game. Simply reprogram the buttons and you're good to go.The Armoury Crate software is okay. You likely already have it if your PC has an Asus motherboard and does the job of setting custom DPI, colors, etc.4 STARSROG Chakram X Origin Review:This not just a regular FPS Mouse, this THE FPS mouse. An 8hz polling rate coupled with swappable buttons and 11 programmable buttons. I can not recommend this mouse for one major reason; the mouse malfunctions while using it in wired mode. If you want to use the Chakram X Origin in pure wireless mode, you can definitely do so, but you will be limited to 1000hz. I'm not sure if it is a firmware issue or a hardware issue, but be aware that using the ROG Chakram X Origin in Wired mode will cause the mouse to act weird. From not being able to move the mouse cursor, to not being able to click anything, to the side joystick glitching and moving in one direction. Oh about the joystick; DISABLE IT. It is incredibly jank and not worth using. It also HEAVILY interferes with any controllers you may have connected to your PC.2/5 Stars.Conclusion: The Spatha X is a chunky mouse that has terrible side button placement but fits perfectly for people with big hands. The Chakram X Origin is good ONLY if you plan on using it in wireless mode exclusively. It is a lesson in frustration using this mouse in Wired Mode.",

                "reviewText": "I was having doubts if I would like such a chonky mouse, but I love it. For a wireless mouse, it is very light, easy to use and the buttons are not in the way when I don't need them. I can use them only when I want and not by accident like other products of the same type. If you want a good ergonomic mouse, with very good battery life and responsive for those FPS games, this is the product for you!",
