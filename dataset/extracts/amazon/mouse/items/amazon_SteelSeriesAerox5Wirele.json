                "reviewText": "I am an avid player of First Person Shooter games (FPS) and as such I demand a low weight, high precision input device. The Aerox 5 fits the bill for me. I am coming from a pedigree of Basic Packard Bell (1990s) -> Microsoft Explorer -> Razer Deathadder -> G502 -> Glorious Model D Wireless -> Aerox 5.While I really enjoyed the Glorious Model D, I immediately missed the extra buttons from my G502. I adjusted to the reduction in mouse buttons by grabbing a foot pedal for PTT voice comms (similar pedal: https://amzn.to/3VwdEuD) which turned out to be an amazing upgrade.The Model D only lasted a few months before the scroll wheel malfunctioned. The wheel would randomly scroll causing me to weapon switch during intense left-click firefights. The right click mouse button also started sticking.So, looking for an upgrade, I stumbled upon the Aerox 5.The things that immediately drew me to the Aerox 5 were the 9 programmable buttons. I love that the mouse is an ultra light, weighing only slightly more than the Model D I was upgrading from. The mouse is pretty much perfect in every way, however there are a couple of annoying things I will point out here:1. The dongle is USB-C. I do not have a USB-C port in my PC, so I was running the dongle with a long USB-A -> USB-C connection... until I stumbled upon the direct plug adapter (2nd pic). You can get one of those here https://amzn.to/3GmkoH6. I wish they had included one with the mouse.2. The mouse profiles in the SteelSeries GG software don't reliably automatically switch. I have different profiles set up for each of my games with different button bindings and while the profile normally switches just fine, it's not 100% reliable. Easy to fix. I would recommend just having the 1 default profile and setting the extra mouse buttons to the NUMPAD keys and then change your key bindings in game accordingly. That way you don't have to mess with profile switching. That's how I'll be setting it up once I reformat and lose these profiles.3. There is no DPI indicator light on the mouse that I can tell.4. The battery life is not the greatest but more than adequate. It'll last 2 or 3 days before needing a charge. I normally just connect it back up when I'm done playing and never really notice it.All in all, a great mouse and I highly recommend it.

                "reviewText": "This mouse is so amazing I can not express my feelings enough how good it is. At first I thought it is on the large size (which is a bit) but I am also sort of big guy, so fits my hand perfectly. It is ultra light weight. with the mouse pad from SteelSeries also it is perfect match. The app is very straight forward to configure the mouse and speed scenarios, during the gaming and other usage you can easily change with one click, super easy.Now the downsides:Battery life is quiet short comparet to office type wireless mouses, heavy gaming like 10 hours a day lasted me 3 days, approx 30 hours :). Using it cable plugged actually didnt affect the steering too much, so most of the time using cable attached and for my friends I purchased 2 more non wireless version of this.Not sure if it is downside but since it is so lightweight, when you try to click side button which is up/down direction you can not hold the mouse stable, it moves, so lets say you are playing a shooter game, scope is open and want to use down button on the side, there is no way you will stay on target and press the down button at the same time.Over all, I am very happy with it, fits my hand perfectly, speed variations and smoothness is amazing, high quality with matching RGB with my SteelSeries keyboard, go for it...",

                "reviewText": "This mouse is fast and floats on the pad, and is lightest mouse with 3 side buttons i could find, and i love it, its a heavy pricetag for a mouse, but if your a hardcore gamer like I am in FPS and looters shooters especially, this mouse performs excellent. It's about the same size as logitech g502 heroI bought it because it was on sale for 100$ I was going to get the Glorious O 2 wireless super light (but they only have 2 side buttons) or the Glorious model I 2 MMO wireless but was a little heavier and reviews about the side buttons made me weary (They are both around 100$ but usually has a discount of 10/20%)I'm glad I got this one and have no buyers remorse. I mainly play Escape from Tarkov, and many other games that require to many keybinds that if you don't have more then 2 side mouse buttons you're breaking your left hand with all the combination key binding (pressing multiple keys to perform action) as use my side mouse button for leaning I need thar extra trigger for toggling and combo hot keying it with a keyboard bind.The battery seems decent enough to last a few days of constant playing and use, I use my PC for work as well as gaming so I definitely probably drain a battery faster then most, and the fact you can charge and use wired is great as well.The only con I see is the price which if if you catch a sale isn't bad, the Steel Series proprietary software that pushes a Ad page every time you open is to adjust settings (i really hate when companies do this like i bought your stuff let me use it without tryin to push more stuff) the fact you can't seen the RGB lighting when your using it (which isn't really a problem for me since u dont care but figured someone might think it is)All and all I love this mouse very much and can't recommend it enough.",
