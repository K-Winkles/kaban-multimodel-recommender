I have become very disappointed with wireless mice. For no reason they just stop functioning in multiple ways. My favorite wireless mouse, that I purchased on Amazon in Jan of 2022 just stopped charging. I also thought about how annoying it\u2019s become to stop what I\u2019m doing to wait for the wireless mouse to charge anyway\u2026so I thought I\u2019d take a look at wired mice to see what\u2019s happened with them. This one works perfectly-every function-and has SO MANY fun light options. The one filmed is my favorite. Worth every penny of the $14.23 I paid. 10 stars (I guess I should wait to see how long it stays functioning for the 10 starts. I have a feeling it will be awesome for a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First impressions:It comes in a small, minimal waste package, with simple instructions. It seems like a good size/shape for any size hand or grip preference. It's corded, so you don't need to worry about batteries or connection issues. It has preset configurations and works great right out of the box, but if you download the software for it (super fast and easy download), there are sooo many customization options. If you're into fancy customizations, you could spend a good while going through all of the little details; but, if you're like me (minimalistic and not tech savvy at all), the customizations are super simple and self-explanatory, and not necessary for use. There are six preset DPI mouse speeds (1000, 1200, 1600, 4000, 6400, 12800), but they can be individually changed and adjusted to your preferred speeds.For regular/\"office\" use: The lights can be turned off for a more subtle, professional look. There are mouse sensitivity, scroll speed, and double-click speed settings.For gaming: I've only used it on World of Warcraft so far. The \"office\" configuration and \"gaming\" configuration are easy to switch between (with one hold of a button), so, if you like your in-game \"look speed\" to be different from your typical mouse speed, that's an option. The two biggest problems I have when gaming are 1) death-gripping my controllers and mice to hard that the buttons stop working, so it's nice to have a mouse that clicks when I want it to, and 2) my hands getting so sweaty that I can't properly grip the mouse, especially when every millisecond counts (yes, queue the PVP losses and raid/mythic wipes...), so this honeycomb shell is a life-saver with its breathability, along with allowing you less slippery grip. This mouse is also super lightweight, so reaction time is way better than with other mice.Side note: If it's not gliding on your mousepad, it's probably because you haven't peeled off the clear plastic on the little pads on the underside of the mouse.All-in-all, I've only had it hooked up for a few minutes, and am still going through the customizations, but it's awesome so far!P.S. You can configure the lights to look like a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica;) (Video attached for reference.)Hope this helps!",
