                "reviewText": "Up to now, I'd only used big brand name mouses like LogiTech and Microsoft ones. But after my 2nd Logitech mouse giving me the accursed double-click problem, I'd had enough and ventured out. This mouse was highly rated, so I gave it a try.It feels great in hand. It's slightly larger in size than others, but in a good way. I feel like I can get a good grip on it. The Left & Right click buttons have a nice but easy click to them and minimal travel distance. The 3 thumb buttons have a bit more travel and feel a little more mushy, but still good enough for their use. There is a \"4th\" button next to the Left click button that is also very crisp with low travel, and I'm still getting used to it being in that spot, but it's working out fine.There are 2 buttons on the top that increase/decrease the DPI/speed of the mouse travel, but I don't really use them. They could be set to some other function, but I simply have not done it.You can set the buttons to other keystrokes using the small software driver that you download. It's fast, easy, simple. No complains. I didn't even use the software for the first few days, as I used the mouse right out of the box. Only later did I want to change my buttons to other settings.You can use the mouse plugged into a USB-C cord, or not plugged in at all. So even if your battery runs low during a game you can jam a cable in and keep going, no problem.The side grooves where you hold it are angled. This was new to me. So my thumb rests on a ledge at the button, and as you squeeze inward to hold the mouse you'll find it buries itself into a groove. At first this felt weird, but now I see how it's meant to help your thumb wedge in and hold in place. There is a similar but shallower case on the other side where your pinky & ring finger go, though the 2 fingers rest on different edges of the mouse. Again, different, but I got used to it just fine.The mouse has 2 modes, normal and economy. Normal mode makes the mouse light up with LEDs and look like something from Star Trek. But with a simple flip of a switch you can turn the lights off into \"economy\" mode and presumably the batter lasts even longer. I use economy exclusively, as I don't care about lights on my mouse. But I'm sure many would think it's super kool.Been using it for about 2 weeks, and I'm loving it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Finally, a wireless gaming mouse that's rechargeable, RGB, also with a budget price. Coming from the Redragon Griffin mouse, this one is a huge improvement in the ergonomics but still has much to desire. It can be on the more round and wide size and often times my ring and pinky fingers just slips right off when I reposition the mouse. No complaints on the dpi adjustment and scrolling, the side buttons on the other hand, I disagree with the first button being \"L Shift\" then the ones above being the \"Back\" and \"Forward\" causing me to stretch just for the forward button. The placement is other wise perfect just above your thumb rest. I never found a use for the \"fire button\" and polling being adjusted from the bottom is okay. I wish I could remap these buttons, but the software drivers don't appear on the website to download.Battery life is Great and the included USB-C charger means your can use it both wired and wireless. Very clear on charging with light indicators. The wireless receiver is well... a receiver, it works.The RGB is colorful, and bright, the placement being on point, no hot spots, overall good. Can't change it without the software so its stuck on the rainbow affect. (Edit) With the software you can only change to outer edges to a static color. The Logo can cycle through colors but it isn't very bright. Last the scroll wheel only lights ups to indicate the charging level.The build quality of this mouse is fairly plastic, much like the other Redragon mouses but still sturdy. The rubber feet on the bottom, again much like their other products, its okay.Overall at $40 this is a great wireless budget gaming mouse. My only issue was the lack of software put a limitation on my overall comfort.Update: As of 10/26/2019 the software is now available on their website!Update: As of 11/20/2020 Mouse is still doing great and haven't had any issues with it so far. I also add mouse grips to the side to solve the grip issue.",

                "reviewText": "The mouse is comfortable, and it moves very nicely on my mouse pad. I use it for all games. But the only game I can see people not liking it for are maybe FPS. It is a big mouse and it's not the lightest. So flick shots and quick and many movements can make your wrist tired. But for anything else I found it to be absolutely perfect. When playing fps games I just adjusted my settings so I don't have to move the mouse so much to turn or aim. The 3 side thumb buttons are cool to, the extra 3rd one I use for PTT and it works very well. The scroll wheel is very nice and smooth but is not one of those wheels that keeps spinning when you flick it. The clickers are perfect and the grooves for hands are awesome. If your claw or fingertip mouse grip user you might not like it, but it feels like it was made for palm style. I do fingertip style and works just fine. There is a turbo button but I have not used it yet, but I hope it programmable to just be an extra button, minus the turbo. The lights are very nice and tasteful and they change color when low on battery and on full and med battery. I can perceive no lag on wireless mode. The software is super easy to use and looks nice. Overall it's another awesome RedDragon device and they are now my go to for pc peripherals, they always exceed my expectations.",

I had a msi interceptor ds200 and it feel the same quality but cheaper and wireless. No input lag and very precise. There is some review that say the battery doesn't last long, I don't know if they change it, but I played for 8 hours and I am at 80%. And for those who have a problem with the software, its not the m801, you need the m801p and try to run as administrator. One more thing, this is the most confortable shape you will try, every finger have a place to rest.",
