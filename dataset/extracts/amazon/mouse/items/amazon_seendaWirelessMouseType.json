                "reviewText": "This mouse comes professionally packaged in a cardboard box from Seenda with instructions and a recharger. This mouse is Made in China. The black mouse is as pictured in the advertisements. It is a frost black matte finish with a really cool backlighting around the scroll wheel and along the base. It works so well and it is easy to charge and the wireless connection is flawless. I did at first have issues located the Type C and USBC connectors but they are in the bottom of the mouse protected by a switch plate. They are very easy to remove and insert into your laptop. I have not used with this mouse with my MacBook, only my Dell laptop. So my review is when using this with my Dell. I do not usually have any issues with getting logged off since I am constantly working on my Dell, but the jiggler helps when engaged if I am grabbing a quick lunch or drink to keep me connected. It is really easy to engage by pressing down on the scroll wheel for 3-5 seconds and when it backlights green that means the jiggler is active. To disengage just press the scroll wheel again until the green backlight turns off. The smoothness of this mouth is incredible and it is very accurate especially on my desk made from walnut. I have not had any issues with the tracking capability of this mouse. It is compact and very well designed. It is very easy to grip and use. The design is perfect. I am right handed so it works very well for me. I also like the fact that you do not need to use the base perimeter lighting if you want to conserve the battery. I like the base light being on as it just looks really high end. I highly recommend this mouse, even if you do not need a mouse with a jiggler. It is seriously one of the best wireless mice I have ever used. You will not be disappointed. Set up took less than 5 minutes out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "It took me a little while to figure out how to properly use this mouse, but I love it! First, make sure you fully charge it. It does not come with a charge (at least mine did not!) Then, look underneath the mouse and there is a small section that you take off which is where the USB-C or USB-A receiver plug is. You choose which one you prefer, that is what connects your mouse to your computer. Make sure you press the \"M\" button to choose which one you are using, and it should connect.I love the size of this mouse. It is smaller than my old one and it glides around beautifully. The button under the scrolling button changes the RGB light, so you can choose from multi-colored, single-colored, pulsing single-colored, and tons of other choices, which I was not expecting but LOVE. That might be my favorite part of the mouse! There is also an option for \"jiggler mode\" (choose it by holding the scroll button until it lights up green) it makes the mouse continually move even when you are not touching it. I believe that is to keep your computer from going into sleep mode. The only thing I don't love about this mouse is that after not using your mouse for a minute or two, the RGB lights will shut off until you touch it again. I love the lights, so I wish it would continuously stay on, but I guess that is just me being picky. As far as I know, there is no way to turn off \"sleep mode\".I am very happy with this mouse, and I absolutely recommend it for casual use. I would not recommend using this if you are a gamer, but that is what gaming mice are for!",
