                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about buying this mouse since it has a rechargeable battery and lights on it. I was worried it would have terrible battery life, especially due to the lights. I was also worried about the size. My old Logitech mouse took a lot of abuse and still works great, but I wanted something different. Safe to say I love this mouse! It's big enough to fit in my hand but not huge. It's only about a quarter of an inch smaller than my Logitech. The battery lasts me about a week before I have to recharge, but it charges quickly. The lights are pretty and have many different patterns. The sleep mode is very useful and works well. I also love the DPI setting.By comparison, my old Logitech has no DPI setting, has rubber siding that collects oils and dead skin from my hand, and no sleep mode, though the rechargeable Energizer AA battery I used for it lasts several months before it needs changing.This mouse is smooth both in the hand and with its movements. The click is silent but satisfying. I also love that I don't have to have a AA battery for it to work. I haven't been able to get the wired connection to work, but maybe I misunderstood the description and this mouse doesn't have an option to be used with a cord. Nevertheless, it's a great mouse. My only recommendation is that if you value a longer battery life, maybe a 1 week battery (even though it's a rechargeable mouse) isn't the best option for you. But if a 1 week battery life is a good fit for you then you'll love this mouse!Update: 9/27/23Well, it finally happened. After almost exactly two years, I finally have to replace this mouse, but not because it doesn't work anymore. Surprisingly, the scroll wheel is what gave out. The lights still work, it still charges, and I still get a full week of battery on one charge. It has been dropped, tossed in bags, pushed off by my cats, and rattled around on the bottom of my backpack, but it still works perfectly except for the scroll wheel which now just rolls freely. Honestly, I was pretty rough on the scroll wheel so I'm not surprised. I definitely ordered a replacement, and I'm still keeping the old one just in case. Maybe I can get it repaired.",

I've never been able to get the hang of the touchpad. Other than that one issue, I do love this mouse.",
