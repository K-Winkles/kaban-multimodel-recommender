Although it takes a bit of time to adjust to its unconventional design, once you do, it proves to be an excellent mouse. The absence of wires and the compact, foldable design make it incredibly convenient for on-the-go use. I can even carry it in my pocket without any hassle.One of its standout features is the impressive battery life. I've been using it for months, and the battery level is still around 70%. Not only does it offer longevity, but it also delivers a satisfying and precise performance. The Bluetooth connection is reliable, and the mouse glides effortlessly across the screen.It's worth noting that the Microsoft Arc Mouse doesn't support left and right-clicking simultaneously. However, for everyday tasks, browsing, and office work, this mouse is perfect. The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable grip, and the sleek aesthetics perfectly complement my Surface computer. If you value a good design and portability, this mouse is a fantastic choice.",

This is Bluetooth and it works flawlessly with my computer. It is very economic and super easy to travel with as it straightens out to a flat piece. My only suggestion would be to include a small case with it, that you could carry it in your bag without it getting dirty. I had a little sleeve hanging around and I use that when I travel, but everything else is perfect for this.",

                "reviewText": "Love it, highly recommend.Scroll - Excellent - Up/Down, Left/Right. Smooth motion, sensitive , no lag. A pleasure.Aesthetics - Excellent - It's gorgeous. I went with 'Sage' (ie green), I feel the soft matte patina and muted pastel color could align my chi. ; )Portability - Excellent - Best portable mouse out there? V likely. It\u2019s light, collapses to a slim iPhone like profile, u can put it in ur pocket and the biggest bonus is in a bag; there\u2019s no bump.Pairing - Excellent - Putting the Arc in pairing mode is easy enough, press a small button on the base. It is easily discoverable, super quick to connect (to anything) and no lag after connecting, on par w Logitech MX's.Build Quality - V Good - It looks/feels expensive, materials r top notch. While it\u2019s build quality is v good and the collapse/expand mechanism will hold up the Arc isn\u2019t quite as durable as a Logitech MX Anywhere 2S. Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s better than just about anything else out there but the price point puts it into Logi MX territory.Software & Customization - V Good - U can download Microsoft\u2019s \u2018Mouse & Keyboard Center\u2019 app. The app installs quickly, detects the device without any hesitation and u can\u2019t tell it\u2019s there (doesn\u2019t affect system speed or boot time). The app allows for button & scroll customization. It has a broad selection presets and you can add your own key combos, the preset selection isn\u2019t as good as \u2018Logitech Options\u2019 but u can get around that by entering keyboard shortcuts. Something to note is u don\u2019t need the app (unless you want to customize), the Arc is great without it.Palm Fit - The Arc fits nicely in your palm, it\u2019s arch angle is well contoured and it\u2019s v light. I found myself using it with my thumb and middle finger tips.3 Finger click - Excellent - It's customizable and works every time.Battery Life - Not sure - Business partner has an Arc, hence can expect at least 1yr. The Arc comes w 2 x Duracell AAA batteries. I like the way it\u2019s not rechargeable.Wake up time - Excellent - No wiggle necessary, it's almost immediate. If you look for it you can see a .4 or .5 inch movement is all it takes. Please note that also depends on the system it's paired with.Final thoughts. If u r looking for aesthetics + performance this is for u. The Arc is a premium product that delivers on everything; functionality, performance, portability and looks/feel. I especially like it's light weight and the way it eliminates that awkward computer case/valise/bag bump. Where it falls short is within this price point it should have multiple device functionality. That feature is more than a 'nice have', a portable mouse always needs to connect to more than its primary device (for multiple reasons). This missing feature is kind of a big one, hence I deducted 1 star. By comparison the Logi MX Anywhere has 3 device options. Would I recommend the Logi MX over the Arc? No. The Logi has a slight edge on functionality but the Arc is an overachiever in it's own right and more than perfect for my purposes.What Microsoft should do is compliment the product with a desktop version...Add volume, fwd/rev functions but still make it collapsible so you can easily carry it between meetings or stick in your drawer etc..",

I had to call MS twice and the first person was not very helpful, but the second person that I talked to resolved my issue and replaced the mouse under the three year warranty.I had a similar mouse for travel with and loved it it shut the battery off when you lay it flat. That mouse is over 6 year old and works fine. It has great feel and got one a few years back for home (the one that went bad). I would highly recommend this mouse especially if you travel or want have a Bluetooth mouse. Flatten it and the battery shuts down.Not to mention the great support.Thank you MS.",

Comprei em 30/03/2022 e s\u00f3 hoje 18/07/2022 esta me dando aviso de 5% de pilha, ou seja dura uns 4 meses (uso pra trabalho das 8~18h, de segunda a sexta). Tive um pequeno desconforto no come\u00e7o pois o dedinho fica voando na lateral do mouse, que \u00e9 bem diferente dos padr\u00f5es, com o tempo acostuma, nada dram\u00e1tico. N\u00e3o tenho do que reclamar, sempre quis esse mouse e n\u00e3o me arrependi de comprar. Vendedor enviou super r\u00e1pido, comprei dia 29 e dia 30 j\u00e1 tinha chego; O mouse \u00e9 bonito e chamou a aten\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa inteira quando eu adquiri. Ele \"dobra\", posi\u00e7\u00e3o reta fica desligado e economiza pilha, a posi\u00e7\u00e3o curvada esta ligado e pronto pra uso. Apesar de ter s\u00f3 1 bot\u00e3o, ele cumpre as fun\u00e7\u00f5es clicando pelo lado direito/esquerdo, o scroll \u00e9 touch e funciona em qualquer parte dos bot\u00f5es, tanto na vertical como na horizontal, s\u00f3 sinto falta do bot\u00e3o de scroll mesmo pelas suas fun\u00e7\u00f5es, mas ta b\u00e3o.
