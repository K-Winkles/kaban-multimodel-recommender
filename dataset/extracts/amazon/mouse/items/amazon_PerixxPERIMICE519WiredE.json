It worked well the first month then went down hill even after a full night\u2019s charge. I wanted to love it as it fit perfectly in my petite hands and felt really soft. Overall, I would not recommend.Update: excellent customer services I emailed customer service on the perixx website and they exchanged the product for me!",

I tried a several different mice that friends and coworkers recommended, but none of them were comfortable. I'm 5'1\" with small hands, so when I saw this \"mini\" ergonomic mouse, I immediately ordered it. It fits my hand perfectly and the pain is much better since using it. It also was very easy to get used to since the angle isn't too extreme. Only issue is that I sometimes have to toggle the on/off switch to get it working if it's been a few hours and my computer went to sleep.",

Very sad about the lack of longevity with this purchase.=======================\"One size does not fit all,\" is the best adage for searching for the most suitable small, vertical mouse. It's like trying on a pair of glasses: you have to try on many pairs, and the one you pick probably won't suit someone else. So it is with my search for the best mouse for me, and my small female hands. This mouse won out because it fit and didn't cause added distress or pain to my hand. The matte finish creates a nice soft texture to touch. The buttons near and above the thumb are easy to get to and don't accidentally 'get in the way'. The click is silent and soft. Searching for a new mouse has taught me to listen to my body's needs, and not necessarily the reviews of others. To each their own!",

I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a desktop or travel mouse with comfortable design and great ergonomics.",

                "reviewText": "I decided I needed an ergonomic mouse. I knew nothing about which one to get. I went to trusted websites and found several that recommended this one along with much more expensive ones. I just started using it and it's great. I have small hands and this one fits me well. I thought it would take time to get accustomed to vertical mouse, but it's very intuitive and comfortable. It's bluetooth, so I had to plug in the USB just long enough to pair it with my laptop. Then I removed it and put it in the slot on the mouse where it is stored, happy to have a USB port freed up. It's rechargeable too, so no need to replace batteries. The pointer is a curate and the scroll wheel feels just right. Why spend more when this is everything I need?",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this mouse for a year for daily light use of about 2-4 hours a day. From a grip and posture standpoint, the mouse is comfortable for the price point. However, the build quality is terrible. Within 6 months, the scroll wheel began malfunctioning. While scrolling down physically on the wheel, it does not register properly and either does not scroll at all or scrolls up instead of down. As someone who uses the scroll wheel regularly for reading, this is a huge issue. For example, when using Maps for directions, the scroll wheel is useless to actually zoom in on any area and track anything on a map. I have to now look for a new mouse, as this one did not hold up for even 6 months of use; highly unsustainable. Save your money and buy a better mouse.",
