It's very smooth and the clicking is super quiet.QIAOYUS's customer service response time is speedy and they were super helpful when discussing concerns.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: After less than 3 months of use, the jiggle stopped jiggling. It still works as a regular mouse, but since I purchased this to keep my computer from falling asleep, it's no longer useful to me. I also found the height of the mouse uncomfortable after a few hours. I requested a return and even though the original return window had closed, Amazon authorized the return.I originally bought it for the jiggler function so that my laptop wouldn't fall asleep. It works exactly as advertised and is also comfortable to use. The different light colors are also fun! I haven't used it long enough to determine how long the battery lasts on a full charge. The mouse physically doesn't jiggle, but it keeps the cursor moving when it's in jiggle mode. Happy I purchased this!",

I have two of these, one is newer, and that one hasn't stopped working like this yet. It is fully charged, so that isn't the problem either. Maybe look in to a different jiggler mouse, or jiggler adapter. It is cheap, so at least I don't feel like it was a complete waste of money.",
