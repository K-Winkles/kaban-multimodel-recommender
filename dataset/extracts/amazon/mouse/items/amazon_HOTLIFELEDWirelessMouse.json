                "reviewText": "I got this to replace the original Lenovo Yoga mouse I got with my Yoga 920. That was the worst mouse I ever had. Instead of a thumbwheel, it had a pad that you slide your thumb on to move the mouse. Similar to the touch pad on a lap top. Except you had to get moving on the pad before anything happened. It was just about impossible to use. Then, the Yoga mouse would \"sleep\" if you didn't use it for, like, a minute. And when you moved it, nothing would happen. Sometime, moving it wasn't enough, I had to slam it on the table to get to do anything. The only thing good about was when you unfolded it was flat and would go nicely in your pocket. The battery finally failed. I wasn't thinking, and started to order a replacement, you know, because it was original equipment. But it was $65 bucks. For a bad mouse. So I got this instead. It has a thumbwheel, connects with bluetooth, etc., works REALLY GREAT and doesn't go to sleep. For $9. The other thing is when the Yoga went to sleep, the touch pad would wake up, and with my wrist on it the cursor would suddenly go off somewhere and I would be typing into the wrong place, or deleting what I just typed. Because this little guy DOESN'T GO TO SLEEP, as long as I am using it, the touch pad on the Lenovo is dead. It is the ideal combination. I know, it's all kind of little stuff, but I held off buying a different mouse because the horrible Yoga mouse was kinda working. I should have chucked long ago. You'll really like this mouse, and it IS slim enough to put in your pocket.",

It didn't illuminate the full ring of LED until it was connected (wifi or 2.4ghz) and in use.It has a full sleep mode as well, where it shuts off, and doesn't re-engage until you press one of the mouse buttons.It's motion is smooth, and the mouse feels good in the hand. It's rather light, but I believe a portable mouse shouldn't weigh too much.",

There's only one USB connection device do if you lose it you're stuck with Bluetooth. The scrolling wheel is quite hard to press for clicking, but it scrolls well. The buttons in the middle are useful, but aren't that easy to reach when operating thr mouse.Aside from these tiny complaints, it's an amazing product! Avid recommendation if you don't have the budget for a higher quality mouse.",
