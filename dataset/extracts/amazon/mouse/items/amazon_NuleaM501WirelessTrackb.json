                "reviewText": "If you're hesitating - don't. Buy it. As someone who spends 15 hours on the computer every day, I am always on the lookout for the best peripherals to make my work more efficient and comfortable. And after trying out numerous trackballs, I can confidently say that the Nulea trackball is the new king in town.Not only does it have a sleek and ergonomic design, but the trackball itself is incredibly smooth and precise. The DPI controls offer variation you wouldn't expect on a sub-$80 trackball much less a $23 trackball. I no longer experience wrist strain or fatigue after using the Nulea for extended periods of time and they included a cute little wrist support bean bag. . And the best part? It doesn't come with the hefty price tag of some other popular trackball brands.But don't let the affordable price fool you, the Nulea trackball is built with high-quality materials - the finish itself is soft and not hard plastic - and feels durable and sturdy. This thing was built to last. It also has correctly placed forward and back buttons (Windows Only) and a scroll wheel that also acts as a 3rd mouse button for added convenience. And compared to my previous Logitech trackball, the Nulea has far exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and comfort. The weight is enough to hold it down and it doesn't slide. The 2-year warranty is an added extra bonus - and I do believe that they would honor it if I need it.If you're in the market for a new trackball, do yourself a favor and give the Nulea a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Save money and get a great device. It truly is the best trackball I've owned in years, and at such a great price, it's a steal. Say goodbye to wrist pain and hello to a more efficient and enjoyable computing experience with the Nulea trackball. I was hesistant - and now I'm happy.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars No problems and it's a worthy successor to my old Logitech models",
                "reviewText": "I have been a longtime user of the Logitech Trackman series of thumb-operated trackballs since they came out in 1996 (the white ones) and have been using nothing else since. Sadly, they changed from the flatter white models to the more \"humped\" gray models which are not as comfortable but generally just as good.The problems with those gray ones is they are somewhat slippery and, as they are angled higher, your hand wants to slide off of them (solved by adding grip tape to the top) and the trackballs eventually get sticky and jittery leading to a jerky mouse movement no matter how well you clean the trackball or the bearings inside the housing and you have to buy a new one every few years.Instead of just buying another Logitech, I decided to try this Nulea model and I'm quite impressed with it. It too is quite slippery and could use some grip tape but it's slightly flatter and more comfortable. The trackball is very smooth (at least it is now while new) and the buttons seem to be adequately stiff so you don't accidentally activate them if you rest your fingers on the buttons.Like Logitech, the buttons are a bit narrow and my right ring finger sits more to the side of the right button rather than centered on top of it so sometimes I press and nothing happens since I'm not actually on the right button. That's a muscle memory issue I have to get used to (or rotate the mouse slightly clockwise so my fingers are more centered over the buttons.)The DPI button is good for when you need fine control - just click it to get back to the minimum value and do what you need to then click it to get back to the higher value. A nice touch. The scroll wheel turns nicely and is not too clicky. The forward/back buttons are nicely positioned and work well.The description says it's not compatible with FPS gaming but I tried it with some standard games such as Far Cry, Sniper Elite, etc. and it actually works totally fine. Using the DPI button as well as the built in mouse settings in Windows or a 3rd party tool like X-Mouse Button Control allows you to speed up or slow down the mouse to dial in what you need for aiming. I have no issues with it in gaming.So, brand new out of the box, I'm very impressed with the build quality and ergonomics of this trackball. It's not perfect but nothing ever really is. For the price, this is a fantastic value. Hopefully it lasts as long as my Logitech models did.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a fan of thumb trackballs since the Logitech Trackman in the mid '90s. I've tried other non-Logitech trackballs. This is better than anything else out there - including the current Logitech offerings. The ball sits solidly in place and doesn't shift around like some trackballs - even if you're using it on an inclined surface like the arm of a recliner.The device feels solid and the large grips hold it in place on a desk. I love that there's more than one color option for the ball.*** Most importantly *** this device is not limited to a single Bluetooth connection but can connect to two devices via Bluetooth and a third via the USB receiver. I like that the selection button is on the bottom of the device where it can't be accidentally bumped and that there's an individual LED for each connection rather than a single LED that blinks out which device is connected/connecting.My only wish for this is (and the reason I didn't give 5 stars) is - why stop at 2 Bluetooth connections? The sweet spot to me would seem to be 3 devices: work computer, home computer, tablet. Yes, this device does support 3 connections, but only with the USB receiver. Many laptops are dropping large format USB connectors. For me, that means I can really only use this with 2 devices.One minor nit: The USB receiver is nicely recessed to prevent accidental dislodgement, but it's so well protected that only smaller fingers - or fingers with long nails will be able to easily extract it. This isn't an issue for me as I don't intend to use the USB receiver, but might be for some.",

                "reviewText": "Since the mid 80's, I've had several Tracker Ball Mice and as an 80 year old, I can honestly say that this is the best Tracker Ball Mouse. It doesn't go into sleep mode until it hasn't moved for 30 mins, others I have used sleep mode within minutes! I charged up the internal battery with the included \"c\" to USB cable - a decent length instead of the usual 2inch or so cable, they've got that right as well. It was easy to set up after I downloaded a big print M501 manual from Nulea.com. It paired quickly with my Desk Top Dell i5 Core running Windows 10 Pro. without having to use the included Nulea USB dongle. It was simple to go through the DPI range to alter tracker speed. Considering the price, and comparing it with a mouse I have that cost twice the price - it is more user friendly and easier to set up. All I have to do now is set it up for my Assus VivoBook 17 Laptop running Windows 11 and register the warranty, (that other makes don't include). Now when I change machines, I won't need to swap out the dongle. As my daughter's birthday is coming up soon, I'm going to get one for her as she always wants to borrow my Tracker Ball. Can't fault it - it's great!",

Pour ma part et m\u00eame si j'ai mis presque 3 ans pour en racheter un apr\u00e8s que le mien soit tomb\u00e9 en panne, je n'ai jamais pu me r\u00e9habituer au souris et j'ai toujours regrett\u00e9 mon trackball.",
