                "reviewText": "~*PROS:*~+ The grainy feel of the mouse is nice.+ Clicking with all buttons feels great. You won't accidentally click by barely putting a bit of weight on the buttons, nor do the buttons require too much pressure.+ The mouse wheel feels good and works well - it doesn't scroll too fast and you're not going to accidentally click the middle button when you're trying to scroll.+ The USB cord is long, and it feels/looks nice. I wasn't expecting it to be made with soft, clothy material.+ Windows 7 automatically installed the (basic) driver for it, and the mouse was fully functional basically as soon as I plugged it in. I haven't tried configuring the two side buttons yet; will update this review when I do.+ 3 DPI settings (with the highest being 2,000) that are easily interchangeable with the button below the mouse wheel. One of the mouse's LEDs changes its brightness based on the current DPI setting (brightest = 2,000), which is perfectly fine for my needs. Just click the DPI button until you have the setting you want. Since there's only 3 settings, this is a fine way of doing it.+ Movement and clicks are very precise and responsive. No issues.+ The mouse looks sharp thanks to the architecture and the color scheme.+ You can open a weighted compartment on the bottom of the mouse that lets you alter the weight of the mouse. The mouse's weight feels fine to me with all of the weights intact, so this feature really doesn't matter much to me, but it's still a nice feature to have.+ At the time of this review, the mouse costs $14. That's definitely a steal considering all of the features it packs.~*CONS:*~- Despite the nice grainy grip, there's still a \"cheap plastic\" underlying feel that is undeniable. If the mouse lasts a decent amount of time, this is only a minor complaint and doesn't really matter considering how good of a mouse it still is at the price.- I wish there was a quick and easy way to turn off the bright red LED lights that shine out from all over the mouse. Perhaps there is, and I just haven't found it yet, but it'd be nice if there was a button on the mouse. I'll do some research later and will update this review if I find anything.- The mouse is smaller than what I'm used to (but it's not that small). It's been easy enough to adjust to the smaller size, but people with bigger than average sized hands will definitely notice the small fit.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Good Buy",
                "reviewText": "I bought this in 2017. It is now 2020. I am still using it. It still works as well as the day I got it.Left button still clicks. Right button still clicks. Scroll wheel still scrolls. Side buttons still work. Except in some situations, namely certain games that I'm pretty sure don't accept extra mouse button inputs anyway. For example, in Deus Ex Human Revolution, Bioshock, and Starcraft 2 they don't work, but in Fallout: New Vegas, Metro 2033, and Dota 2 they work perfectly. Seems more a problem with the games themselves than with the mouse. Regardless, their primary function, to go forward and backward on most web pages, still works fine. I use it regularly- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, even gaming apps like Steam, Origin, Battlenet, and Gog- it's a great unexpected utility. It's easy not to click them if you don't want to unless you have fat thumbs or a lack of muscle control; luckily I have neither but YMMV. It's a hardy piece of hardware. In the games I mentioned above, you need to do a lot of clicking. A lot. Honestly I've clicked it so many times that sometimes my fingers get tired (especially in RTS/Moba which take a LOT of clicking) but the mouse still clicks. It's been three years, I must have clicked hundreds of thousands of times if not millions, and it Still. Keeps. Clicking. Granted I keep it clean and pristine and don't let it get gummed up with cheeto dust or bbq seasoning but it should go without saying that you take care of your electronics or they don't work as well later.The weight and the DPI adjustments are functional, I just don't use them. I removed the weights because they bothered me bu hey they're removable so no harm no foul. Some certain games with messed up mouse acceleration or weird sensitivity input (looking at you, Dead Space) do require a DPI adjustment. There's only 3 tiers which is meh but it's better than none or having 3 million tiers. The lasers are incredibly functional on a variety of surfaces and the material is smooth enough that many surfaces can be used well. Mattress, mousepad, desk, a pair of jeans, I'm honestly shocked how well it works on different materials. The cord has frayed slightly over the years but that's mostly because in my setup, the cord wraps around my external speakers to plug into my computer, and it seems to have only frayed where it rubs up against the speaker. Even then, only a few strands pop out, and the cord itself is still in great condition. The black and red color palette is inoffensive and helps to see where it is in the dark. And the design overall is pretty sleek and cool. My hand is perfectly sized for the hardware so if your hand is the size of my hand (I have hands of fairly average size) you won't have an issue. I can't speak on battery life because it has a cable.Essentially this is baby's first gaming mouse. It's pretty much right in the middle between a practical one typically used for web browsing etc, and a pure gaming one which, well, is used primarily for playing video games. It's enough that I can use it for both activities without encountering any problems. I have to use it in the correct USB slot or I'll encounter problems, but that shouldn't come as a shock to anybody who knows basic electronics. I trust Redragon brand enough that when I buy a keyboard and replacement mouse (if this one ever breaks) it'll be them. Thanks for three years of a good mouse Redragon; here's to three more.",
