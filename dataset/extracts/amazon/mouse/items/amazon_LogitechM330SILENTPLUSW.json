                "reviewText": "I am a mobile gamer. I originally bought this mouse about two years ago. When it says this mouse is silent, it is silent! The clicks are smooth and light. I play games like League of Legends, Diablo and Path of Exile, which are games that require constant use and clicking of the mouse. When I say constant clicking, I mean hundreds and hundreds of clicks a minute. My original mouse lasted me over a year, then eventually the left mouse button stopped functioning. I am more than impressed with the longevity of the mouse, especially with the constant torture I put it through. The mouse got used easily 8-12 hours a day with constant clicking and gaming and held up over a year. When my first one broke, I bought a different mouse and was I unimpressed. The new mouse claimed to be silent, but I soon learned, it was not. Hearing hundreds of back to back loud clicks every minute gets old in less than a minute. I instantly spent the little bit more and bought this mouse again. The profile of the mouse is nice, and the way it sits in your hand is also nice. It has a smooth and low profile and isn\u2019t bulky like some other mice. The wireless signal is also good, I\u2019ve stood up to 15 ft away from my laptop and still been able to use the mouse totally fine! I would highly recommend this to anyone! Overall is a great mouse to use and is an outstanding product!",

                "reviewText": "I love everything about this! Packaging was super easy to open from the back. The mouse's USB receiver was inside the battery compartment so don't panic if you don't see it right away. Very clever hiding spot. And the setup was very simple. Just plug and play.The design is very ergonomic. It fits the right hand perfectly with a comfortable spot to rest the thumb. But the main thing that I love about it is that it's silent! Like truly silent. I'm still getting used to the lack of noise when I left click and right click.I will say though, the scrolling wheel is not silent. Now I don't usually use the scrolling wheel that much anyways, so I'm okay with it. But if you're somebody who uses it a lot and need a silent scrolling wheel, then it could be deal-breaker. But otherwise, it's an excellent mouse.",

                "reviewText": "This worked great for regular use, but after about six weeks there is serious lag. Even after trying different battery brands, this thing just seems to lose it mid scroll. Can't even see using this as a gaming mouse, as it now has a hard time adjusting to it's location onscreen. Decent for everyday casual use, if you can get past it resetting itself or whatever. I wouldn't use this for gaming, though. Too unreliable. Also very small. The quiet clicking feature is nice.",
