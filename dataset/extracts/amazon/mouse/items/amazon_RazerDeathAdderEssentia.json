The DeathAdder Essential boasts a robust construction that feels comfortable and durable in hand. The rubber side grips provide excellent control and prevent any slippage during intense gaming sessions. The mercury white finish adds a touch of elegance to my gaming setup, making it a visually pleasing addition.The heart of this mouse lies in its 6400 DPI optical sensor. The accuracy and precision it offers are exceptional, ensuring smooth and responsive tracking. Whether I'm engaged in fast-paced FPS battles or performing precise movements in strategy games, the sensor performs flawlessly, delivering the utmost accuracy and minimal cursor jitter.The five programmable buttons on the DeathAdder Essential are a gamer's dream come true. The customization options available through Razer Synapse software allow me to personalize the mouse according to my gaming preferences. I can assign macros, remap buttons, and create profiles for different games, giving me an edge over my opponents.One standout feature of this mouse is the integration of mechanical switches. The satisfying clicky feedback they provide adds a tactile element to my gameplay. The switches are incredibly responsive and offer a satisfying tactile feel with each press. Combined with the smooth scroll wheel, the overall responsiveness and precision make gaming an absolute joy.The software support from Razer is top-notch. The Razer Synapse software is user-friendly and offers a wide range of customization options. I can fine-tune the DPI settings, adjust the lighting effects, and even calibrate the mouse to different surfaces. The software also allows me to sync my mouse settings with other Razer devices, creating a cohesive gaming experience.In terms of value for money, the DeathAdder Essential exceeds expectations. Considering its competitive price point, it offers a remarkable set of features and performance that easily rivals more expensive gaming mice on the market.Overall, the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse in Mercury White is a stellar choice for gamers seeking a reliable, high-performance mouse.

                "reviewText": "I disagree that this mouse is considered a gaming mouse. Other than the fancy logo and color changing LEDs, there is not much about this mouse that caters it for gaming. I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight. This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.But as a general use office mouse, it works great. It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK. For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this mouse. I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.PROS:-Feels great in-hand.-Cable is plenty long.-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.-Build quality is solid.CONS:-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel \"bounce\" when scrolling.SIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!Other than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more \"pro\" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading.",

The light up detail on the mouse is pretty and matches my new setup- it's white on the white mouse and green on the black mouse.The two side buttons are useful as key binds in many games and to go back and forth with webpages and I'm happy there isn't a DPI button near the scroll wheel- no accidental DPI changes. The mouse also has a slightly matte texture on the top which makes using it enjoyable. Not a very heavy mouse, is a good size for an average length hand.",

Y bueno, el problema se present\u00f3 a los 2 meses, desde entonces basta una fuerte soplada para que se arregle. Para jugar el Viper 2 es mas ligero y mas comodo. La ergonomia de Adder esta pensada para diestros pero aun asi la forma en que tomo el mouse me es mas comodo con el Viper. Sin embargo la presicion de este, el tiempo que me ha durado hacen de esta una exelente compra. nunca he tenido problema con los otros botones, ni los laterales ni el clic derecho o izquierdo. Responden bien y lo puedo conectar al PS5.",

I have 3 razer devices plugged in all the time and I don't have their software installed.UPDATE after 2 month of use: scroll wheel indeed glitches scrolling to opposite direction",
