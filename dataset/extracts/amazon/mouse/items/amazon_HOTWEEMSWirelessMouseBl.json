                "reviewText": "Bought this mouse on April 22' and I use it every day for work and entertainment (not gaming). Overall it kept its promise about the battery, this was my first concern when choosing for a mouse with long battery life. Battery has lasted for about a year (and counting). I don't know if it will make it to 16 months, but for me 11 good months are a fair enough.The clic is not silent but also not loud, the normal level for working without being annoyed by the sound. I also liked the ergonomic design. I've never used a mouse with buttons for back and forward but know they are essential for me. The DPI adjustment is also very nice, it has three levels and it's very easy to get used to it.In the photo the logo is quite erased due to daily use, but overall this is a very nice mouse to buy.EDIT: July 2023 - After 15 months the scrolling wheel started failing when navigating. Not changing my opinion about the mouse, I will purchase another one.",

                "reviewText": "Likes: - Comfortable in the hand- Feels solid without being too heavy- DPI button is a nice touch and doesn't get in the way (accidental clicks, etc...)Dislikes: - Sleep function on this mouse happens way too fast.- Scrolling is not good. Quick moves tend to scroll up and down simultaneously making the screen go nowhere.Overview:I like this mouse but unfortuntely the reviews are accurate. The sleep function is maddening to say the least. Type a little too long and you'll find yourself wiggling to mouse all over wondering where the pointer is. Click a mouse button and suddenly it appears. I would have dragged that timer out for at least another minute or two or make it so it woke up on movement as well as click. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about this.Scrolling doesn't work very well either. There are a few things you can do to help remedy this situation which helps immensely:1. Go into windows settings and change the number of lines to scroll at a time. It defaults at 3, I changed it to 1 and it was really smooth, but too slow for my liking. I went to 4 and that seemed to be good.2. Click down on the wheel (For those that may not know, your wheel is a 3rd button) and you will see a small circle with two arrows appear. move it up and down to scroll smoothly. The more off the click point you go the faster it will scroll.If you are willing to live with those two things it is a great mouse. If not, you'd be better served with something else. I had a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. I went with 4 because for me, it works well and I'm okay with the workarounds. They lost that 5th star because the sleep mode could likely be resolved with a simple software update. For the money though, it's a tough mouse to beat.",
