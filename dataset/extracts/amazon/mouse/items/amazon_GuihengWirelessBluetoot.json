                "reviewText": "Expect me no features and I'll tell you no lies. What you see in the pictures is what you get: a low-profile mouse that oozes GamerCool with RGB.Pros: It's dirt cheap. It's a dual mode (dongle+BT) mouse that costs less than most BT-only mice. It's rechargeable, but it hasn't converted to USB-C yet.Cons: Even though it has RGB, it is in no way a gaming mouse. The switches are mushy and soft, with barely any tactile feedback. The rubber on the mouse wheel is the sort that just **promises** to get all sticky and gross in a few years. It's low-profile, so it's best for young, healthy hands that can bear a little punishment/poor ergo.Nons: Neither pro nor con. The RGB is not controllable. It's on, all the time. It \"breathes\" and fades into different colors. It's not very bright, so it's easily ignored. Given the low power draw that is signature of LED lighting, I highly doubt it noticeably affects battery life.Summary: Go ahead and buy it. It's dirt cheap, and talks dongle+BT. Even if you hate it, what did it cost you, a vente at Morebucks?",

                "reviewText": "The mouse does exactly what it is supposed to do so I don't want to complain. I believe this is more about personal preference. I don't like how you can't turn off the LED lights. I won't want rainbow lights flashing the entire time I'm on my laptop so that's a bit annoying. Also, the mouse is VERY slim, even more than I expected, so it isn't great if you have big hands or long fingers. If those two thing's weren't an issue, it would be perfect, but I would keep those facts in mind before purchasing.",
