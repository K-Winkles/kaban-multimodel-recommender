As he had a LED-customized keyboard, I figured he could have a mouse that had LED lights as well. I was looking for a fairly priced but comfortable design. The order came in promptly, and after a quick setup, my brother was happy to announce his satisfaction and even kept insisting I see his new desktop layout. My brother liked the quietness of the click and the fluidity of the movement. So I'll say this one was a win.",

I'll be keeping this mouse and using it as a traveling mouse to go with my laptop, but I've decided not to use it as my everyday mouse.I'll start off listing the Cons, then get to the Pros.Cons:*I don't like the 3 built-in DPI settings, so I have to customize my mouse speed via my computer settings. This is true both on my PC tower and my MacBook Air. I've found another around this price point that meets my needs with more DPI settings and software support.*Bad for people with smaller hands. I have to \"reach\" for the click buttons and the forward/backward buttons.*USB dongle is stiff going into the USB port. This is actually a pro if you're using it in one location. If you're switching between PC and laptop like I am, the stiffness makes me feel like I'm going to break the dongle every time I pull it out of the USB port.Pros:*Very quiet click.*The design and color changing is a nice visual.*Good mouse for the price point.",

This looked kinda cool so I bought it on a whim but was honestly skeptical that it would work very well. But it's really exceeded all expectations I had for it, and some I DIDN'T have...LoL. It's worked flawlessly since the first day, no issues with the lighting or the DPI settings which surprisingly have worked perfectly as well. Has good battery life and fully charges in only about an HR, and it can be used while charging too. So it's basically always working, no matter what, no more batteries needed...ever. There's just really nothing negative I can think to say about it... Would recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "Day 1 of usage: no manual included in box but not a big deal. I can google if I have a question, I suppose. I needed a wireless mouse because my jerk of a cat chewed through the cord of my last one.It is very colorful & is easy to use, just plug in to charge & use. I have no idea what the DPI button on top of the mouse is for. There are two buttons on the left side and it goes back (upper) and forward (lower button) on whatever webpage you're on.The switch on the bottom of my mouse seems to be the opposite of what is shown in the description of the product. When it's in the up position, my mouse is off, and the bottom position turns it on & cycles the light. Not sure what the middle position is yet-just w/o illumination as far as I can tell.It's a decent mouse, longer than the usual logitech one and seems pretty responsive with my Dell laptop. The silent click is something I haven't really thought about as an option. Now it seems really loud when I type on the keyboard since my mouse has a silent click! LOL. Will update review after more use. All in all, a good buy!It is now day 365+ I honestly have not used this more than a handful of times. I tried it out while I was teleworking and the dang thing is SO SENSITIVE that it jumps all over and selects things randomly! Since I work with financial docs I couldn't rely on this peripheral to do my job accurately. There's no room for mistakes! It was also moving folders around, etc.!I guess it's just a pretty light-up mouse, unfortunately. Wished I could return it! Waste of money for sure!",
