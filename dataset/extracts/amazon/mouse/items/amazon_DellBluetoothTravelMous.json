The best I can say about a famous brand is that the mice were cheap and they worked moderately well and then (too soon) not at all. I hesitated at the price of this Dell travel mouse (approx. $50). However, it is worth every penny. No more hand cramping. It works beautifully with my 2 computers. It travels well on business and in moving from one computer to another at home. No need to buy extra mice because this mouse can control up to 3 devices with the touch of a button. Best computer accessory buy I've made.",

                "reviewText": "The concept of this mouse is excellent. When twisted, it is flat and can be carried easily in a pocket. The bluetooth connectivity is good as well. But I found the mouse unusable for three reasons. First, the ergonomics is awkward, and it will take a while to get used to. I never got used to it and my hand started hurting after a while of using this mouse. Second, the pointer is not as smooth compared to a regular mouse I have. It is strange because the DPI spec is excellent on this mouse, but in real life usage, it is just not as good. Lastly, this mouse is noisy when moved! The front and back ends of the mouse on the bottom are made of hard plastics materials, and makes loud scratchy noise everytime the mouse is moved, whether on a mousepad or a desktop. It is super annoying and for a $50 mouse, they can (and should be able) to do better.",
