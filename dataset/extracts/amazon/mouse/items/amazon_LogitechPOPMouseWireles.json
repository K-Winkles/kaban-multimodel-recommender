It\u2019s surprisingly fast and responsive, good weight, portable and easily connects to my work laptop and personal laptop, no lag time for me. I had an M330 silent plus (that broke within a year) and this mouse feels sturdier and even seems quieter to me, which I was pleasantly surprised by. It\u2019s not intended to be ergonomic per se (there\u2019s a whole category of mice for that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for) yet it does have a slight curve to it that gives it a contoured feeling that\u2019s more comfortable that smaller mice tend to be. I use it most of my work day without any issues, love it!",

                "reviewText": "This mouse is SOO cute and I love it so much! I normally don't leave reviews but I loved this so much I had to. I'm a graphic designer and I bought this just to use for work and personal use. Not really a gamer so I can't speak to that but here is why I love it for a few reasons:- The design/color palette is so adorable and is just pleasing to look at- It fits great in my hand, but I do have smaller hands- The click on it is almost completely silent and feels oddly satisfying- The scroll is also really smooth/satisfying to use- I love the customizable buttons. I don't really use it for an emoji but I love that you can customize to another shortcut- The material itself does not feel cheap to me. I purchased another cheapo wireless mouse on Amazon before getting this one and you can tell the difference. I wouldn't say this is LUXURY by any means but it's definitely a bit nicer quality than a knock off cheap mouse.And finally the MAIN reason I LOOOVE this so much is because of the multi-device technology. If you download their software, you can use their \"Flow\" tool that allows you to easily switch the bluetooth mouse to another screen simply by moving the mouse off the edge of the screen.I bought this to use with my work laptop and personal laptop at one time so I can keep them both separate and it is almost a completely seamless transition between screens. You don't even need to push the button on the bottom of the mouse if you have Flow enabled. I use this with my logi keyboard (not the POP version but another kind) and it makes working feel more fun and cute (as dumb as that sounds lol). Just buy it!",

                "reviewText": "I learned this year that Microsoft isn't making name-brand mice any longer. I have a few MS Bluetooth mice, but they are wearing out. I will do this review as a comparison to those mice because it's an upgrade in a few aspects.One, they both use a single AA battery for power. I love that. Mice with internalized batteries to charge are such a pain when they die.Two, this mouse is very quiet in comparison. I get self-conscious about how clicky I am with my other mice. This one is a very soft click.Its design is bright (I got the yellow one). I'll have a hard time losing this one.The cover is held on using magnets. Three tiny screws at the rear of the cover are enough. I was timid about this design choice, but it works fantastic. The only problem will be if the mouse happens to fall off your desk, the cover may detach, slide off somewhere, or break. But my current MS mouse is broken because of falls. A breakaway cover like this one would have been a better idea.Last, the tracking light doesn't flash when you pick up the mouse. The one on my MS mouse is constantly flashing. If I pick it up and look at it, it is still flashing. This may use a non-visible spectrum light because I can't get it to show up.This mouse is fantastic. I am ordering a backup now in case this wears out one day. The MS mouse was discontinued when I went to order a replacement. That was good, though, because now I have this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using my mouse long enough to have worn out the battery once already, and I couldn't be much happier! This mouse does require AAA batteries once the one included wears out, but it seems to make good use of it. I constantly forget to turn this mouse off, and I was still impressed with how long it lasted before needed a replacement battery. To replace the battery, you remove the upper casing from the base, which is a little tricky, and a lot stressful. This is the one place I really have a complaint about this device. Though there have been no problems yet, the plastic does not feel thick or strong enough to handle being pulled off the base frequently without eventually breaking, which is my concern.I have my mouse connected to three different devices and have tried it with others. It connects pretty quickly and switches between three saved devices with a push of a button. It is easy to connect to Bluetooth devices, and works just as well on Windows, Mac, and IOS (iPad) from my experience so far. The mouse moves smoothly and quickly, and though it performs better on one, works decently well without a mousepad as long as you have a flat-ish surface. The Bluetooth is quite strong, I can use my mouse from several meters away with none to few connection issues, which is better performance than other wireless mice from a similar pricepoint that I have tried.The plastics are soft and comfortable to the touch, and the rubber-y grip on the wheel makes scrolling very smooth and easy. From the pictures I saw I expected this mouse to be flatter and shorter than it actually is. This means that for a small hand, this mouse is also more ergonomic than I expected, and though this certainly wouldn't be the case for everyone, I actually found that I had less wrist pain after hours of use than with the more \"traditional\" mouse I had been using prior to this one.I would buy this mouse again in a heartbeat. It is cute, comfortable for my smaller hands, and feels like a much \"higher end\" device at a reasonable price-point for the average user.",

It works on my Mac and iPad and I can even switch screens without having to do it manually. I love that the clicks are mostly silent and the colour is to die for.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of these devices (I was going to type mice but decided against it!) for both myself and my father-in-law. I have a newish MacBook Air M1 and my father-in-law has a MacBook Air from about 6 or 7 years ago. The construction is awesome, the mouse feels good in your hand and they paired with the laptops with no issues. The device allows you to pair to 2 separate computers using a slider switch located on the bottom. The battery compartment is located under the two buttons which can be easily lifted as they are held down by a \"just strong enough\" magnet which I find is a very astute and intelligent design. I use mine on a daily basis and have had no issues whatsoever. Logitech is a brand name that I trust and they tend to build excellent products, this mouse proves as much. So far the battery use is minimal, almost uncanny. I would highly recommend this mouse and you should sigh a sense of relief as when you do order it, you've made the right choice!",
