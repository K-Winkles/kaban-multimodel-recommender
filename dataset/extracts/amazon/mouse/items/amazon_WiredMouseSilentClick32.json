I have a slight annoying twitch in my middle finger which often clicks the right button by accident. This is the first mouse I\u2019ve used that has side buttons and those too seem to get clicked more often than I would like. I like that it can also connect via Bluetooth but it sometimes just stops working. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a problem with my PC or the mouse but I don\u2019t have that issue with any other Bluetooth device.",

I wanted to replace it with a rechargeable mouse to avoid this happening again, as well as one with side buttons for gaming and a more ergonomic shape. This mouse is perfect!! It's lightweight, glides easily, and hardly makes sound when clicking (except the side buttons, they have a clicking sound). And as a bonus it's super cute!!! I've been using it regularly for work for 2 months now and it's help up wonderfully. Haven't even had to recharge it yet - I do try to remember to turn it off when I finish work for the day but regardless, battery life is impressive. Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend. Excellent value for price.",

Aber auch Spiele lassen sich sehr gut damit steuern.Die Maus liegt gut in der Hand (ergonomisch) und die Tasten lassen sich leicht klicken. Das Klickger\u00e4usch ist viel leiser als von meiner vorherigen Maus. Wurde mir erst jetzt bewusst, ist auch ein positiver Punkt.Preis Leistung ist hier absolut in Ordnung.
