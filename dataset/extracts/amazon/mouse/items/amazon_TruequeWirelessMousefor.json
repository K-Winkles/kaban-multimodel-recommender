                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Great mouse! Sleep mode difficult to work with, though",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Boy, it was not easy to find another that matched what I wanted at the cost I wanted. I was going to go for a brand name (like, Logitech) but I found that they provided fewer features, for the same (or more!) price! I said I wouldn\u2019t be purchasing this mouse again, but after reviewing my options\u2026yeah, I like this mouse. I\u2019m sticking with it. And I bought it again! I would recommend it for people who are looking for a mouse that not only does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to, but a little more, too! One thing I noticed, though: don\u2019t leave your mouse on all the time! Sleep mode drains the battery too. I put a new battery into my last mouse and tried to put it in my new one, but the battery was dead. So, now I\u2019m careful to turn off my mouse if I\u2019m not going to be using it for a while. But really, that\u2019s something we should all be doing with all devices, so that\u2019s not much of a problem. Great mouse!I needed a mouse for work, a simple one that works without a mousepad. This worked really well and was very responsive. I think other reviewers did a better job of going over its DPI and DPI settings, but since I didn\u2019t have any gaming to do (used to; not so much), I didn\u2019t really need all those settings. They were nice to have, however. I found that the sleep mode could be a little laggy, which wasn\u2019t ideal\u2026 I\u2019d have to click to wake it up rather than shake the mouse, which made it so I\u2019d inadvertently click something like the \u201cx\u201d on a browser window. Modern technology makes it so I don\u2019t have to worry about that much (Google Chrome can easily restore my last session), but it\u2019s still a bother to click things I didn\u2019t mean to click and throw me off for a minute or two. The thing that bothered me the most was that there were times my mouse simply would not work coming back from sleep mode, and I\u2019d have to do some kind of troubleshooting \u2014 such as shutting off the mouse, unplugging its USB, waiting a moment, then plugging the USB back in, then turning on the mouse again\u2026then repeat if it didn\u2019t work the first time \u2014 to get it back up and running again. I was in the midst of troubleshooting my mouse\u2019s connectivity issues (which didn\u2019t resolve no matter what USB drive I put the receiver into) when I got distracted, and now, I can\u2019t find the receiver. I don\u2019t know if I got a faulty mouse in some way (everything BUT the receiver and sleep mode worked great & without fail), but since I\u2019ve lost the receiver\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be buying again. I\u2019m off to look for a better mouse, one just as inexpensive but better!",

I like the feel of the scroll and it\u2019s also easy (and quiet) to click. The only downside is you have to click the mouse to wake it up. I wish movement woke it up so I didn\u2019t have to find a blank space on the screen to click every time.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived in minimal packaging, which was great. No need to find scissors to cut it out of a plastic trap. It comes with an adaptor if you need to plug it into a different type of port than basic USB. That being said, the USB, the USB plug is inside the mouse, which wasn't indicated in the instruction sheet. So at first, I thought I was going to have to return it. But I found it eventually. It is super light to the touch. I am used to feeling the click when I use a mouse this one doesn't do that. So I have accidently closed a few tabs I hadn't meant to. It is nice and great for the price. I just have to get used to it compared to my previous mouse.",
