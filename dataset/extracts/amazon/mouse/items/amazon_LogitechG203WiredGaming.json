                "reviewText": "This is a great gaming mouse for the price. It\u2019s very responsive once you dial it in. The G203 only goes up to 8000dpi unlike Logitech\u2019s other higher end models. I find that 8000 is more than adequate. In fact, I feel that 3000-3200dpi is the sweet spot for me. This model does feature Lightsync. A cool feature is the ability to auto adjust the RBG to what is being displayed on the screen. I like the customizable buttons. It has the appropriate number of buttons for my needs. The scroll wheel is crisp.Pros:Comfortable for my xl hand.RBG is customizable through G HubMedium light weightAccurateCons:The attached cable is plastic instead.The smooth plastic is not as grippy.G Hub is does not always load on start up.Overall, it\u2019s a great value for a budget gaming mouse. I was able to get mine on sale for a great price. If you are looking for a wired mouse, this should be on the top of your list.",

The Logitech program is easy to use and the on board memory is great since I am not able to program from work. I simply set up a profile at home and set it as the on board memory profile and brought it to work. Works like a charm! It's neither heavy nor too light, perfect for me as I don't like a super light or super heavy mouse. The looks speak for themselves, this mouse is super cute and fits my aesthetic perfectly.",

I plugged it into my PC, which is running Zorin OS (Linux) and all the buttons and maneuverability worked straight away without me having to do anything. \"It just works.\" Even the LEDs glow! I am not going to try installing the LED software because I'm too busy for that.As for the quality, it's good. For years I've used numerous \"default\" Dell mice--this one is better. I enjoy the heft. The mouse wheel has nice, grippy rubber, and the mouse wheel seems to have finer increments than I'm used too (a good thing). The mouse button feels good too. Nice work, Logitech!

                "reviewText": "I have the black version of this. The mouse is great and feels comfortable. I like having the DPI button at your fingertips to dial in the sensitivity. The only problem I have is that the RGB cannot be disabled using a hardware button - the color controls are all accessed via software. Which wouldn't be that big a deal if the software actually worked. I downloaded the right software and it couldn't find the mouse. Given its large size (really? 365MB for an app to control my mouse?), I removed the app and just left it as-is. The kids like the RGB rainbow cycle so it's fine. All in all a good, inexpensive Logitech mouse you know and love. For what it's worth my main mouse is still the legendary G5 laser mouse from 2006. I'm pretty picky and I think that this is a fine mouse for any use. I'm only docking it the star for the poor software implementation. Come on Logitech - add a button to toggle the RGB light please.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best \"cheap\" mouse you can buy",
                "reviewText": "This is honestly hands down the best value mouse I've used. If you're looking for the best bang for the buck and purchasing a new PC gaming set up, this would be the first mouse I recommend. Also if you're a 3D artist and looking for a mouse with a nice scroll wheel button and scrolling mechanism that works wonderfully with all your 3D software packages, this is the mouse I'd recommend. For the quality you get, I personally think its cheap and a great deal. Now, having raved about how good of a deal it is, I'm not going to say it's as good as the Razer Viper Ultimate Wireless that I just recently purchased. It just isn't that good. The G203 is considerably heavier than the Viper Ultimate and I have come to really appreciate a lighter mouse. However, the G203 is solidly built and I'm sure I'll be using the two that I have for several years because they are well built and durable.The DPI sensitivity can be turned up far higher than I would personally ever want (8000 DPI) and I doubt it will be a limiting factor for most people. It has a 1000Hz pooling rate, which is a far higher refresh rate than any monitor I know of and I doubt you really need much more if any at all for the foreseeable future. The shape of the body of the mouse is nice, after using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the G203 was a bit shorter when measured rising up off the mousepad but seriously a minor gripe. After using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the backward and forward buttons on the side of the mouse were a bit bigger like the Viper Ultimate but they are workable. The lighting on the mouse is surprisingly pleasing a smooth. From my experience the Logitech G Hub software is well designed at easy to use. I heavily prefer G Hub compared to Razer Synapse. Synapse so often requests log in credentials and it's a rage inducing pain, Logitech in contrast does it the correct way and does not require a log in at all. You just have to install the software and that's it, it works and it doesn't take up too many system resources. The cord of this mouse is a bit heavier than some and less flexible than some but it's not bad. I highly recommend a mouse cord Bungee to go with this mouse, its a great combo if you'd rather not spend the extra coin on a wireless mouse and you can be highly competitive gaming with that set up. I personally use this mouse with the Thermaltake Tt e SPORTS Galeru Bungee on my work machine and it's awesome. I tend not to lug around a bungee in my backpack with my laptop but the G203 is my main laptop mouse and I do well in competitive games without the bungee also.This mouse is an easy recommendation for me, I think it's one of the best investments one can make as a PC gamer. I would guess it's light years better than mice that are included with most if not all prebuilt PC's. As a long time (25+ years) PC builder, enthusiast and gamer it's hard to put into words how impressive this one mouse is in terms of cost to performance ratio, it's a landmark in my mind. It's the minimum and the maximum that I feel like you really need to be a strong competitive gamer, everything else is either that extra icing on the cake or the e-waste that will fill a landfills quickly in coming years. Just my personal guess this mouse could last you 10 years and there wont be a major compelling reason to upgrade outside of weight during that time. A slow transition to all USB-C maybe could happen and that might be a reason to get a new mouse but honestly this one I think will last you a while if you want it to.",
