                "reviewText": "I purchased the Rival 600 a few days ago, I've had it for a couple of days now and wow. I am using this mouse to play Overwatch, CSGO and Battle Field One -- My in game accuracy has in-fact improved, (from 45% hit average to 52%) is an understatement. The tracking is smooth and accurate and the lift off distance sensor works great for me because I don't have the desk space needed to play so I often have to lift my mouse to reposition.I specifically bought this mouse because I have been using the Razer Naga for years now for all my gaming needs. Lately, I've been really into OW and playing Widow and McCree often -- in most matches I did fine but when I faced other GOOD Widows I noticed I'd get beat to a shot by mere milliseconds and my ping is fairly low (30ms on average) and play on a 144hz monitor. I was beginning to think my reflexes just weren't good enough.. Then a friend of mine suggested I get a mouse for FPS games -- (like wth is the difference is what I thought) he teased me about using a MOBA mouse for FPS -- long story short I figured I'd give it a shot. I looked at a ton of reviews on gaming mice and the Rival 600 caught my attention, so I bought. It is worth every cent -- it just feels much more accurate. To be fair if you suck at FPS it won't make you good via magic but it can help you improve a bit if you know what you are doing already, that is MY OPINION.The only issues I've had with the mouse is that the lift off sensor is TOO sensitive. After calibrating the mouse to my pad, I simply set the liftoff sensor to the lowest lift distance possible -- and low behold there are dips and bumps on my pad that I hadn't even noticed before. When the sensor would hit these dips and bumps the mouse would stop responding. At first I thought the mouse was defective and was about to return it but after reading thru a few forum posts on this issue I simply increased the lift off distance a bit and the problem went way.***EDIT***This is the the third product every I buy from SteelSeries, the first product was a wired USB headset that sounded prettty decent, was cheap and broke within a few weeks. I tossed that and carried on. However, recently I found a review for their Artic PRO + DAC headset -- I was sold by the aluminum design (as my previous headset was plastic and broke really easily). Plus I am a bit of an audiophile, meaning I can appreciate good sound equipment (like I hate hate sound bars) and this headset is one of the first HIFI certified \"gaming\" headset. So I bought it.. and feel in love with it -- it was a bit pricey but I am enjoying it. And now the Rival 600 is my new favorite mouse for FPS (I still like the NAGA for FFXIV).SteelSeries is on a roll with me atm with their products, if only they made a competitor to the Razer Tartarus.. I'd buy that in a heart beat -- I recently purchased the Razer Tartarus v2 (I own two others) and it's so buggy and their software sucks -- problem is very few companies make these keypads and most of them are terrible. So SteelSeries make one.. please :P",

                "reviewText": "Rival 600 is the most fantastic mouse I have ever put my oversized hands on. It immediately felt great and it just molded to my hand so well. The sensors felt very snappy. And my aim is 10x more precise than with any corsair and razer mouse I've used. The rgb looks nice. The software wasn't difficult to navigate for me and hasn't seemed bloated or made computer sluggish. It's a near perfect mouse in every way and has immediately made me better at the games I love. The R+L clicks on the front are a separate piece of plastic from the body, meaning your fingers resting will be less likely to accidentally hold the buttons down. (had this problem with corsair glaive and m65.) scroll wheel is easiest scroll wheel click I've felt. The list just goes on. As long as the mouse lasts a long time, it's the best. Time will tell, but right now I'm gushing about it every day. Screaming my love for this mouse from the rooftops.ConsNo braided cable, it's rubber and it sticks. (the cable detaches and you can connect braided micro USB, I've done it.)Side buttons took a little getting used to over the corsair glaive.The finish feels slippery but has not proven to be a problem in game.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse in a bundle for around $200 w/Arctis Pro Headset (no DAC) along w/Doom Eternal Certificate.TL;DR:Best mouse among all my other models for my natural palm grip.Best click feel EVER. (idc if \"Best\" is already implied)But the USB cable was DOA. (real reason for 4 stars) :CThis is compared to Corsair Harpoon RGB, Razer Mamba Wireless/Deathadder Elite v1, SteelSeries Rival 3, Logitech G402(Hyprion Fury), EQEOVGA D10Disclaimer:Everybody grips their mouse differently, and through their application and experiences they may prefer alternatives. (I've tried the Anker vertical mouse, not fit for my daily use)Also this is a review written after 2 weeks worth of use (avg. 3~5 hr. daily), not that long of usage/wear.History:I've started with Logitech G5, then the G502(old school 2005 ver.), but the biggest complaint was the weight and unnatural griping/design for me (couldn't get used to it for years) then I've tried the Razer series Deathadder Elite v1 & Mamba Wireless. (very similar but the both Razer's off-center \"ergo\" hump was not comfortable or natural for long periods. I thought that was the best the industry can offer. Until I decided to try other mouses. The Corsair Harpoon RGB was perfect for my palm but designed for claw grip therefore straining after awhile. Then I gave G402 Hyperion Fury a try (love the glide-ability (better mouse feet) and control(good weight!)) and palm gripping feels a bit better(strange, since G502 is a similar shape) but the left-click switch is more centered (more for claw/fingertip grip clicking). The SteelSeries Rival 3 was a great feel for my natural palm grip, but it is smaller and I find my bottom palm dragging on the mousepad. Then the EQEOVGA D10(Glorious O/D clone) was perfect in almost every way, except the mouse feet(kinda draggy) with the contrasting lightweight kinda throws me off a bit.Initial Review:The Rival 600 from the first several minutes was from joy to frustration, since the box-opening experience was wonderfully presented. But then realizing the included mouse Micro-USB cable was non-functional. (plugging in another was fine, but what if I don't have a repository of cables? speaking from other consumers standpoint)Also having to find a light but long enough Micro USB cable for a mouse was also frustrating.The 8 Zone RGB and Mouse management software (SteelEngine 3) is great. Pretty and simple.I don't bother with the weights, so I don't have an issue with the side-grip parts falling off(for now)Also they are magnetized so they should stay in place if not dropped/demagnetized.The dark meat of this review:When functional, the mouse feels natural and comfortable right away for my natural palm grip. Meaning, when immediately placed on mouse (unlike Logitech or Razer) I didn't need to adjust my grip at all.This mouse in its entirety is capable for me to naturally grip, hold, then manipulate without my rear palm to drag/touch the mouse pad. While able to keep contact with about 70% of my palm, which is very satisfying.All the while the soft-touch material is not noticeable at first, but whenever you liftoff, its assistance is more than appreciated.The click, oh my goodness the CLICK FEELS.Unlike any other mouses, the click is not your average, thin, crisp, light, or meek click.When you click, the feedback feels solid, but reverberates at a deeper click tone.It feels almost like a near-mushy but crisp tactility.There's no wiggle/flex(yet) of the primary mouse buttons, and the grooving on those feels natural/ergo.Bonus Facts:-The included cable actually feels heavier than the mouse!-I use a cable bungee so cable weight could be omitted.-Only 3 mouse feet/point of bottom contact. (interesting choice compared to other mouses, usually 4 or 5)-Only 2 DPI profile switching, strange since Rival 3 has up to 5.-SteelEngine 3 is pretty cool, easy, and simple compared to Razer's multi-program combo mess.-The Arctis Pro (no DAC) is perfect (minus haptic feedback or great sound) compared to Nari Ultimate.",

                "reviewText": "There are a lot of things this mouse excels at, and very little that I could find in almost two years of use.The mouse includes variable weights, and I personally find having a single pod in the right compartment of the device provides the best balance for my use. The 600 is decently lightweight when none of the weights are in, but they do not feel cheap by any means.Moving onto performance, the SteelSeries Rival 600 packs one of the most top-notch sensors in the market; the TrueMove3+ Dual Optical Sensor with 12000 CPI is precise, accurate and is immune to failure.The ergonomics of the mouse is designed for a medium to large size hand, and it fits perfectly into your palms, so that you would never have to worry about tiring your wrists or fingers more than any other top-of-the-line mice.The scroll wheel is not too heavy nor too light on your index finger (or your middle, depending on how you use the mouse), so you can switch your weaponry in your favourite fps game with absolute precision.The LEDs are great looking, and is easily changeable thanks to the great software Steelseries provides. I personally prefer having them off, and that is achieved with great success as the Rival 600 has a memory unit that remembers the latest changes to the LED configuration.As with cons, I really couldn't come up with anything myself, but I've read that the rubber pads on the mouse have a hard time staying on in some units.Overall, I give the mouse a solid 10/10. You're not gonna find too many other mice that are objectively better than the Rival 600.",
