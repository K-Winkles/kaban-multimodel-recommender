                "reviewText": "After being very disappointed by high priced, brand name gaming mice over the years, I started using this mouse several years ago - and it's worked better than pretty much all of the really expensive ones! I use it for heavy duty gaming and have only had one failure in over 5 years, where one of the main buttons eventually got stuck. Now I keep a few of these in my spare parts drawer, so that i always have one on hand when ever anyone in the family needs to replace any of their mice too. This mouse has good feel, excellent responsiveness, can take thousands of clicks with no problem, and is a joy to use. Highly recommended, especially for the price!",
