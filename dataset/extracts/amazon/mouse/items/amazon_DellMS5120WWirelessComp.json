                "reviewText": "The Bluetooth mouse I use at work started to disconnect randomly. Cleaning, batteries, remove and reinstall... nothing fixed it. I looked around on Amazon and bought the Tecknet based on reviews. What a mistake! I wrote a review on that one. Terrible mouse. Avoid it. I didn't even waste my time to return it. It felt good to throw it in the trash.I like Dell equipment. My work laptop is Dell. My gaming PC is Dell Alienware. Love them. So, I spent about 30% more on this Dell mouse and I love it. One AA battery so it is not heavy. Slightly beveled sides (wider on the top) so it's easy to pick up if needed. Very comfortable in the hand and is symmetrical so it's great for left handers too. I called it a wireless mouse because it works with an included USB dongle or with your native Bluetooth. The dongle stores inside if not used. Easy to set up - follow the instructions because there is an option to link to Bluetooth or the dongle. You can switch between the two, indicated on the bottom. The power switch is good. I only turn it off when it's in my backpack. On the desk, it sleeps and wakes seemlessly. The optical sensor on the bottom works onall surfaces and there is no red laser to blind you when you look for the switch. You can adjust the dots per inch sensitivity for your needs. This helps me for drawing sketches with the mouse. There are buttons. The usual left, middle, and right. The middle button is a wide scroll wheel, and it works as left and tight tilt, too. Two thumb buttons (for right hand use). All buttons are configurable through the provided application. I'm not using them for anything yet, but it's a nice option.All-in-all I highly recommend this inexpensive wireless mouse for every day use. I have an expensive Alienware wired gaming mouse specificly for gaming use. But for work documentation, occasional CAD use, surfing the web, this is my new favorite. Dell MS5120W.",

As a gamer, I was worried about a wireless mouse because a prior one would drop connection randomly but this uses bluetooth and has seen no issues in missed input. I'm a 5'10\" male and it fits well in my hand but I could see this being an issue for anyone who uses XL gloves but for anyone smaller than me it would fit better. The design is really clean and simple which makes it look like it belongs anywhere.",
