I have small hands and the Logitech M 215 fit my hand perfectly, one more reason I was sad that it stopped working.When I found the Logitech M 185 I thought it looked similar so I decided to give it a try.So glad I did!! It is the same small size and basically feels the same AND it costs less than $ 13. Can't beat that!!Heads Up: The M 215 had the red light on the bottom so when I unpacked this one and put the battery in it, I thought it was DOA (dead on arrival) because there was no visible light emanating from the bottom of the mouse. I was about to send it back when I noticed the tiny imprint \"Invisible Optic\" on the bottom. Mystery solved!! The optical wireless mouse is functioning correctly and flawlessly!!I attached a picture of my old M 215 and the new M 185 (on the right) as a size comparison reference.",
