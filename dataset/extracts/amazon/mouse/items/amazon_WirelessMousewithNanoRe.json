As quiet as a mouse (no pun intended) - no annoying click sounds, smooth gliding, love the sleep feature. They were also more than simple to set up. Pop in a battery, plug in the receiver, switch on the mouse and you are in business. The designs are super cute. I hope these last longer than the previous ones I purchased (from a different seller, not wireless and cost around the same).If you are like me and say, \"where the heck is the receiver?\" look inside the mouse. It's there (see pic).What I didn't understand is why one of these came with a charging cable and the other did not. That being said, for the life in me I cannot find a place on either receiver or mouse where a charging cable would fit. There are no outlets/ports for a cable. I am thinking it was included by accident.All in all, even though this is day one, both are operational and working very well. Cannot comment on the battery life yet as again this is day one. Remembering to switch off the mouse at the end of the day is sure to save battery life.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 mice. Received 1. Was told they would send the replacement but never received one. The mouse has to be manually turned on each time you try to use it. LIterally have to lift it up and turn the switch on. Very disappointing. Now too late for Amazon to correct. Looks pretty but it's cheap.Because items were packaged differently than the packing order stated, I assumed the mouse was in another box. It was not. Yesterday, the same thing happened. Tracking numbers aren't always applicable to the right package. This is my 2nd experience of this. Too long to explain but now their system says I was delivered two items that I did not receive. Their system says it was delivered because a box with that number was shipped and delivered to me. The contents don't match the tracking number. How do you prove such a thing?This is a systemic issue. Mixing orders and misapplying tracking numbers. I add this info because, on the mouse, I lost $14.99 because I assumed their system was correct. Now I know better. Verify if items are missing. Yesterday's order can be corrected and hopefully will. Supposed to be delivered today. So far, not on my USPS delivery list for today. In fairness, I have had 30 plus orders that were correct in the past few months.",
