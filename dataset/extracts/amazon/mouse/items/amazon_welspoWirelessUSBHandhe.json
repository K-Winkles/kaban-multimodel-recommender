                "reviewText": "Image Wireless USB Handheld Finger Trackball Mouse with Laser PointerI have not had this item long or used it extensively, so take this review for what it's worth.Here are what the various buttons do:Trigger is left click.Upper left button is laser pointer.Upper right button is same as pressing Enter key on keyboard.Lower left and right buttons are right click (context menu).Pros:- Nice to be able to have mouse hand free to be in any position, not chained to the desk. After a lot of work using my Kensington Expert Mouse Wireless Trackball I can feel discomfort in my wrist, so it is nice to be able to pick up this mouse and use it for a while; no discomfort. So it is obviously not as hard on the wrist.- Good wireless range. I haven't measured how far, but at least one customer claimed 40 ft.- Soon after purchasing this item I found myself in need of a presentation remote. This trackball mouse worked great. No problem clicking through slides, my computer in the back of the auditorium and me at the front.Cons:- I have essential tremor, that is, my hands shake sometimes. Thus I find that sometimes it is difficult to precisely point the cursor as my thumb is not steady on the trackball. With the Expert Mouse trackball I can more precisely position the cursor.- The trackball is not as firmly held in place as I would like it to be, and thus the thumb needs to be pulled off very carefully; any slight movement in any direction will flick the pointer off target. If it were firmer, requiring a bit more force to roll, I think this issue and the problem I have with essential tremor would be reduced.- Have to set it down to continue typing, which can be a little less convenient than simply moving hand from desktop-bound mouse to keyboard.- No way to change what all buttons do. Using the free X-Mouse Button Control software (use a search engine to find it), you can change the trigger (left click) and bottom two buttons (right click), and how the trackball and scroll wheel behave. But the bottom two buttons don't appear to be independently modifiable; they will always do the same thing; whatever one is programmed to do the other will do it also.Overall I like this mouse and am glad I purchased it.",

                "reviewText": "Nothing about this mouse is super standout, but it does everything you'd want it to for the price. It works at a decent range. The trackball is decently accurate. The battery life is fine so long as you don't leave the switch on, which it's very easy to do.Downsides are that the keys aren't programable at all with out using a program like X-Mouse, (which I do, but it's still kinda clunky,) that two of the buttons are tied to right click by default (so even if you reprogram them, they change together,) one button is only a laser pointer, and one button, after hours of trying to figure it out, seemingly does nothing at all. The inputs you're left with are scroll up and down on the scroll wheel, a right click on either side of the wheel, a scroll wheel center click, the main 'trigger' left click, aaaand that's about it. It does feel sorta cheap to use, but it's not flimsy at least.If you just need a generic, floating mouse solution, this is totally fine, but really don't expect anything more than the bare minimum. (Also, if the mouse 'works' but the trackball goes out, swapping the battery should solve that. Easy to accidentally assume the camera went out since everything else will continue to work.)",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (9/2022): I reached out to the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement even though it was almost a year since I'd purchased it. I'm updating my review based on my happiness with the mouse (which was always very high) as well as the fact that I'm extremely impressed that the manufacturer was willing to take responsibility and stand behind their product.------------------------------------It's very convenient to have a mouse you don't need to rest on any surface, and I loved this mouse while it functioned correctly. Unfortunately, after less than a year of very light use (at most once every few weeks) it stopped working. Specifically, when I'd plug the small dongle into the PC I'd get the error \"A request for the USB device descriptor failed. Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)\", and no amount of finagling would resolve the problem. I'd have thought the dongle would be bulletproof since it has no moving parts, but apparently just inserting and removing it a few times over the past year put it out of commission.At this point I'm left with an expensive laser pointer, and it's frustrating to know that the mouse itself is probably fine and the only thing preventing me from using it is a bad dongle. I'm now using an old wireless Microsoft laser mouse that's still going strong after 15 years, dongle and all.Maybe I just got a bad unit and you'll be luckier than I was, but as it stands I can't recommend this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "This trackball is quite smooth and easy to use. And it can be held in any position, which is great for wrist/shoulder issues... I can even use it with my arm completely relaxed in my lap. Since it's symmetrical with the left click button operated like a trigger, it's very easy to switch between the left and right hand with no learning curve, and without having to change mouse settings to rearrange the left/right buttons.A few minor cons: The shape could be more natural to hold. The ball is small, so it's not the easiest to manipulate, and isn't good for very technical work. It probably couldn't be your ONLY pointing device. Also, it seems to be weirdly picky about batteries... I find if I use rechargeable batteries with a low-ish charge it won't turn on, even though other devices will work with the same batteries.But overall, I really like it! I recently bought a few different trackball-type devices to find a more ergonomic mouse alternative and vary my hand/arm positions more--this is one of my favorites, extremely useful for this purpose. Also the cheapest, so win-win!",

I like this because I do not have to rest my own on the table. It is great for variety of movement. I can stand on balance board and still use computer while balancing. Also, it can be used in both hands. I highly recommend for anyone looking for balance of movements at work. Some of the buttons I am not sure what they are for. Overall, great product and came with battery. Little USB plug thing gets magnetically attached to the unit so it kind of sticks together.",
