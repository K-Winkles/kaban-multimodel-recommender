I have big hands but I prefer a small mouse with two buttons and a scroll wheel, and this Logitech Wireless Mouse M170 fits the bill, in fact I'm using it to replace a Logitech Wireless Mouse that has been serving me for years. The scroll wheel had stopped working. I have a lot of confidence in Logitech products, and expect this one to serve me for years, and I spend several hours on my computer every day. The excellent price point and promise of long battery life is real a bonus.",

Every year or two, cordless mouses suddenly stop working and I have to get a new one. Corded ones last forever. So no idea what happens. Until then, this mouse, like other Logitech mouses, gives excellent service. It is compact, comfortable to use and has range of quite a few feet. If the computer is being used some distance away, and I move the mouse at a distance of about 10 feet, the mouse still causes the cursor to move. A bit disconcerting until you realize what is happening.Never had to replace a battery before it stops working. I initially thought a new battery was needed but that was not the case.",
