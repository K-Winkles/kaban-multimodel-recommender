I gave it a try myself and I actually like it better than the one I use, so I may end up buying another one for myself.",

I wish It was more comforting for the thumb, there's a pattern that's on the side that'll press into your thumb and it's pretty annoying and agitating when playing a fps game. I also don't like how hard it feels when you press the left button and right button. I have a 2nd gaming, a razor gaming mouse to be more specific and pressing the left and right button is effortless, feels like I'm clicking on a feather, it's just easy and it's smooth. Whereas this gaming mouse, you can really tell it's plastic, clicking on it just feels hard. I also don't like the mouse wheel. scrolling up and down just feels insanely slow compared to my razor mouse. But despite my personal problems with the mouse, I do like it and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lightweight gaming mouse for a low price.",
