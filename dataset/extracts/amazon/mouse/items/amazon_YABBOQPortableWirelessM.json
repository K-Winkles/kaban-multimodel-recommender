The mouse works excellently is very comfortable on these old hands. I didn\u2019t accept the refund because the mouse wasn\u2019t faulty and an excellent mouse. Mouse is great and the company is as well. Their offer was well past the return date but still offered a refund and help. Thanks for the help.Nice mouse but totally useless with out the usb receiver. My computer was being used by a student. When she returned my computer I tried to setup the mouse. I looked up connecting and realized no usb receiver. Bought in December but just now (May 23) tried to connect. So disappointing. Won\u2019t buy from this seller again. Overall it\u2019s ergonomically comfortable and probably would work fine but I\u2019ll never know.",

                "reviewText": "It fits really good in my hand, used for working and gaming, the extra buttons come in handy. For how cheap it was, I was expecting it to break in a week but it works like a charm, very smooth, weighs nothing, no issue connecting to different computers. It does feel like cheap plastic but maybe it is high quality. Needs 2 triple A batteries that are not included.",

It does last a long time after fully charged I could go days without having to charge it.The only thing is this mouse is NOT fast it\u2019s on the slow side and my games require a faster mouse so I\u2019m eventually going to be upgrading I just needed something cheap for the time being.Other than that if you don\u2019t use it for gaming the mouse should be just fine.",
