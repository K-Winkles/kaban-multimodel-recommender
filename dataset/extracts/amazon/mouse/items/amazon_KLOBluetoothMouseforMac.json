Sometimes, for certain games...bluetooth always seems to lag a bit. This thing can instantly switch to the 'usb' receiver mode. The receiver dongle snaps invisibly into the bottom too. It's good design, and it's an excellent backup mode.I got the style with the fading RGB leds..just for a couple extra bucks. Overall this thing is responsive, it pairs quickly, and it just works great. Can't beat it... I'll probably buy one more",

I didn't want to spend the big bucks and get an Apple mouse, so I researched all others available within this very economical range, and I am so happy to report that I'm thrilled with my choice and this mouse in every way. Easily charges during use (have only needed to charge once since receiving using it daily) and has perfect functionality. Synced right up with my Mac laptop on first try and has been working perfectly since. It does \"fall asleep\" kinda quickly, but simply click and it's back in action. It's not heavy duty, don't drop or abuse it, but for the price it was just what I needed!! Thank you Amazon for such a variety from which to choose instead of paying $70++ for Apple's.",

However, it has no indicator of charging status. Therefore, it went dead (after about 2 months, which is a great time length!) and even after several hours of proper charging it never came back to life. No lights and no connection to my computer anymore, so it is now nonfunctional. Seeing as it\u2019s past the 30 day time window, there is no return or replacement option, which is disappointing given that even a cheap mouse should last more than a few months!",

                "reviewText": "At $13.26 after tax this mouse seems like a great deal. It works flawlessly with my Late 2013 Macbook Pro 13\" Retina with High Sierra MacOS Version 10.13.6. When it first arrived I used it with the cord and just left it plugged in the laptop all day yesterday, today I'm using it without the cord and it's great. I'm getting ready to order a hard mousepad today.The reason I bought this mouse is because I use Metatrader 4 and Metatrader 5 and you can not right click just using the Macbook Trackpad. So even though I like my Macbook by itself just using the trackpad, there are a lot of functionalities that you can not access without an external mouse. Even though I bought my Mac back in February 3, 2014 I just now discovered a need for this mouse, but now having used a mouse with my Macbook I'll never look back, there's nothing like the convenience of using a great mouse that works great. It's a lot less work for my hands. I never noticed how hard my hands were working really until just now when I started thinking about how much easier using this mouse is. Anyway thank you so much. :)Note: I love the sleek design, light-weight, the fact that it's a lazer, the last mouse I used was an old-school rolly-polly mouse, haha. It's a bit slippery on this card-stock paper I'm using, but maybe getting a hard mouse-pad with some grippiness to it will help, because specifically when I'm using my computer in bed, the mouse is not on a level surface.So like I was saying, now I have full access to all the features of Metatrader by being able to right-click on stuff. (*see picture) This is likely to be the case on many Windows tools that have been adapted to run on Macs.UPDATE: The cursor seems to move, it drifts, is there any way to calibrate it so it does not drift? is there any software that can help with this? late 2013 macbook pro high sierra 10.13.6NEW UPDATE: The cursor no longer moves or drifts and works perfectly! Something I hadn't figured out before is that ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO TURN THE MOUSE BACK ON IS CLICK THE MOUSE! Before I figured this out I was \"re-pairing it\" to the blue-tooth which was really so annoying. But now that I know how to properly use it it is amazing. Thanks!",
