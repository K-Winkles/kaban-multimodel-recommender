Easy access and storage for USB receiver A++The clicking is indeed silent and the feel of the button is a matte soft feel vs. a typical smooth plastic, I like the matte feel. A+++CONS:I\u2019m returning though. The look does not match what I received.The front points out for no reason but cool looks.The base is just wider than it needs to be. Not good for travel as I need 2 for my line of work and I travel a lot with my gear.Durability is not great. Feels cheap. I\u2019d pay a few $ more for something built better.",

I've just had it for a few days, so I can't say how long the battery will last. It came fully charged. I'm considering buying another one for my laptop.",

Nearly identical in shape to the old mouse. Not ergonomic at all. Unless they mean you can click the buttons.Bonus? rechargeable. No more batteries.Works great. Scrolling normally again.
