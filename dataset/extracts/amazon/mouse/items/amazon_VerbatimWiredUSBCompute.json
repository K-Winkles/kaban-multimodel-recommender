It's not a quiet mouse but again you take the price into consideration. It's all plastic construction but it doesn't feel flimsy-cheap. You can game with it as long as the game doesn't require more than the a basic mouse layout. Like Half Life 2/Black Mesa as an example.",

(I used it on a Windows computer, so I am not sure if it works with Mac. (I\u2019ll try later & update this review.) Left and right buttons click fast, middle roller thing isn\u2019t stiff; holding sides are smoooooth- and easy to clean.It's also important to say that, I tried out the mouse without a mouse pad- (just the surface of my kitchen counter) It connects fast and is soft to touch, therefore easy to use. No complaints so far, and I am satisfied with how fast it arrived. I\u2019ll update this review after using the laptop for a week to share any further updates, if necessary.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for an economical Mouse, $5 - $6 to resell and for the amount of time I spend at the computer, one that I can use as well. So far I have tried the Rii Mouse, Verbatim and this one the HONGDE.The HONGDE:This thing is HONGDE (Huge and Heavy)! It is very Slow - when moving and dragging the cursor creeps around the screen. Don't know if this has anything to do with its DPI setting. I did a few searches on Google and found nothing on how to adjust this. The buttons seem to be accurate and making good solid contact when clicking but because of its slowness in movement, using the mouse seems unresponsive. Overall, using this mouse is uncomfortable, tiring and very time wasting.The Rii Mouse:This is a real nice looking mouse; good size and good weight. It has good speed when moving and dragging. The buttons has a balanced tactile clicking action. This mouse was on its way to becoming my perfect under $6 mouse until I started using it seriously. The clicking contacts are erratic, like they are shorting. When I press and hold a button to highlight or drag it does not maintain contact even though I still have the button depressed. Then it will get worse as it will regain contact. So the mouse buttons will make contact, lose contact and regain contact erratically when depressed. Well we know that practically all Windows Based Software have specialized functions tied to the clicking action of the Mouse - positioning, highlighting, copying, cutting, pasting are the basics. Imagine these functions happening unpredictably when you are trying to work. Screwed up Documents and Worksheets mayhem. This clicking and contacting inconsistency makes the Rii Mouse very frustrating and even impossible to use.Verbatim:The Verbatim while not as pretty, looks and feels similar to the Rii Mouse, same size and weight and a little faster movement. Of all three Mice it has the most natural responsive feel. However, after about 2 to 3 months max of daily use the button contacts get worn and it begins to exhibit the same erratic and unpredictable behavior like the Rii Mouse, described above. I am changing my 3rd Verbatim Mouse today for this same reason, erratic, inconsistent, unpredictable behavior, the same as I had to change the 1st and 2nd ones.Remember I was buying these Mice for resale. I tried at least 3 or more of each of the three brands and the issues I explained for each were consistently the same for all that I tried.I will be rating them as follows - HONGDE - 2 Stars Rii Mouse - 1 Star Verbatim - 3 Stars",
