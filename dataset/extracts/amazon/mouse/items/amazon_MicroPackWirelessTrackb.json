                "reviewText": "I absolutely hate touchpads and in most of the places where I use my laptop and even on several of my desktops, the real estate is such that using a traditional mouse is very difficult or impossible. I usually rely on trackballs. They all have had some drawbacks. I have a Logitec and a Microsoft in the standard horizontal configuration. First of all, horizontal is not very ergonomic. The natural position of your arm on the table it is to have the hand vertical. In addition, because of the design, your hand tends to push forward on these devices making them slide. On my large desktop computer, I actually have used double-faced tape to stick it to the desk because the sliding became so annoying with the Microsoft unit. This device is extremely ergonomic and natural feeling to use. There is no tendency to slide or move whatsoever. I have never used the \"forward/back\" buttons on any of my other trackballs so I don't miss their absence on this device. You can switch the sensitivity but the press of a button behind the thumb wheel. Very convenient. One thing that does take a little getting used to is what to do with your thumb when you're pressing the left mouse button. With a traditional horizontal trackball, you're pressing down toward the table so there is no tendency to move the cursor. With this device, when you press on either the left or right button what you're actually doing is \"squeezing\" the button towards the ball. The result is there can be a tendency for your thumb to move slightly on the ball and move the cursor. This gets a little easier to control with practice however there's also a very convenient ridge right above the trackball to rest your thumb on when you're pressing the buttons which makes it a little bit easier. Dragging and dropping is the only thing that is really kind of tricky. With a traditional mouse or trackball, since you are pressing down on the button, using the ball itself is an independent motion and easy to do. With this device because of the squeezing action, it's a little tricky to keep the left button pressed while you are manipulating the ball to drag something to a new location. Not that it can't be done. With little practice you can learn to press slightly downward on the button as opposed to the left which takes the pressure off the thumb and allows you to do the dragging motion. What would really be nice is a mechanism to turn the left mouse button into a sticky key but I haven't found any way to do that yet.I have seen reviewers downgrade the device because the ball becomes \"sticky\". As someone who has used various designs of trackballs for well over a decade, I can tell you this almost always results from either the ball itself or the supports inside the ball cavity becoming dirty. If you are using this in an environment where your hands are likely to be dirty or sticky or there is a lot of dust around, frequent cleaning is definitely going to be necessary as with any trackball. And if you have little ones using your computer, figure on cleaning the ball mechanism pretty much every time they get their hands on it.The price is very reasonable and if you are looking for a more ergonomic alternative to a traditional trackball, it's well giving this a try. I will probably be replacing the cursor control devices on all of my computers with this unit.",

                "reviewText": "First time using a vertical style trackball / mouse. It takes some getting used to the vertical layout, but it does put your hand in a more comfortable position. I gave it five stars for ergonomics, comfort and accuracy, but four stars overall. There are a couple of detractors. First it goes to sleep too quickly and can't be brought back to life with a simple wiggle of the ball. You have to click a button. Second, it requires it's own USB port which may or may not be a big deal depending how many ports are on your PC. Finally, it doesn't feel particularly high grade so time will tell how well it holds up. Not a bad device, but not my favorite, either.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this trackball mouse to try and alleviate some pain in my elbow and wrist. The reviews sold me on it. Once I received it and put it into use, I noticed very quickly that the ball is loose inside the mouse, and this causes great difficulty in making smooth and accurate movements. My job consists partly of making multiple mouse clicks within small check boxes so that I can build shipments for my employer. An inaccurate mouse makes this task much harder to do, and also causes mistakes to happen.I decided to try and make do, so I could give myself ample time to get used to this mouse. I have a trackball that I use at home, but it is a different brand and not as ergonomic as this one.After a couple of days, the mouse has started to turn off on it's own, even though the on/off switch is manual. It would not come back on, without my having to manually turn it off, and then back on.This made me decide to return it. I don't have the time or patience to trouble shoot a new product with these types of issues.",

                "reviewText": "First I love the angle on this and all trackmice SHOULD be vertical from an ergonomic standpoint. Having them flat like a regular mouse is like half fixing the problem when you want to completely remove any strain on your writs and arm. (Note a vertical mouse is as neutral as you can get from your arm positioning).That being said, it's the only thing good about it. I mean the buttons work and everything but that trackball isn't the best. It DOES work, keep in mind, but it's not very accurate (though I do appreciate the dpi button) and it tends to stick a bunch, jumps around, and doesn't roll super smoothly when you want to go slow.It's a good first step to a vertical trackmouse but if you already know you want one, just get a better quality trackmouse and figure out a way to lean it up to be as vertical as you can get it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this hoping to get a more vertical wrist position than my Logitec MX Ergo trackball. It delivers on that promise but that's it. The DPI switch is located so I seem to be constantly hitting it. When I (try to) use the trackball it may or may not work, its tracking speed is erractic (to put it mildly) and I constantly have to play with the DPI button and the on/off switch to get it to function. I constantly have to use my Ergo trackball to locate my cursor. Beause of this I find this trackball to be essentially unusable, which is a same. I love the more vertical position it offers compared to the MX Ergo, but I hate everything else about it. It may be the perfect trackball for some people but not for me.",
