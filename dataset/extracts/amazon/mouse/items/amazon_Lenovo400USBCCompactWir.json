                "reviewText": "Three design flaws:1: The sharp side edge for the buttons really digs into your thumb and ring finger (claw grips) over time, causing fatigue and not wanting to grab at the painful mouse. Might not be a problem for palm grip users.2: The underside feet have very straight long horizontal edges. This causes the mouse to 'scrape' at a mouse pad when moved directly forward/back. Its the kind of 'scrape' that makes you think something is on the mouse pad, so you brush at it. Only to find out its just the feet on the mouse itself.3: When the optics fire up when you move the mouse, there is an audible high electrical whine coming from the mouse. Its quiet when the mouse is left alone, but when you go to move it, the optics fire up again and it whines. This is heard in my office, and I'm in an urban city area.Whats good:The button pushes are decent. The mouse wheel rolls decent. Its a usb-c plug so it works directly on modern macbooks. Its dirt cheap for a travel mouse you need in a pinch.",
