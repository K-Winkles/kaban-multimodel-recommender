                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Operationally and Ergonomically perfect with some significant caveats - Updated 1/16/2024",
                "reviewText": "Update 1/16/2024Why I still show it as 5-stars is for these reasons:1. It is drop-dead reliable. I've gone through several other Bluetooth mice since I bought others to replace this one due to features I liked better. Everything else you need two mice in your bag.2. LOOONG battery life. This plus being reliable beats the inconvenience of being able to use the mouse when charging. It also has no corny lights to turn off every time you turn the mouse on. It just works with no lag.3. It is a durable mouse with a magnetic top so there is nothing that breaks if you drop it.4. It is ergonomic5. Its slim design adds very little bulk to your backpack bag, which is important for airlines.6. To fix the issue with the USB-C cord, I now have USB-C cords that fit it easily, including the one that powers my laptop.What's left not-to-like- Cannot switch between multiple Bluetooth devices. I want this feature, but when I had mice that could do it, I never once used that capability.Review:It's a nice looking mouse, and it feels better and works better than any Bluetooth mouse I've ever worked with. The rechargeable aspect is something I had to have this time. It's not that batteries cost enough to matter, it's that you always need to inventory spares when you travel. It wakes up instantly, unlike may other mouse. I don't know yet what battery life is.Now for the caveats:- I bought it because it has a USB-C charge interface to be able to charge it with a USB-C cord, except you can't, thus the whole reason I bought this mouse and USB-C cable to go with it was a waste of time and money. It does have a USB-C charging port, and comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, which works fine, but the area around the USB-C port on the mouse is undersized to grip the USB 2.4Ghz dongle so a standard USB-C cord will not plug into the USB-C port on the mouse. I have two regular USB-C cords from different vendors that I have that I tested with and one of them is even a high-end Thunderbolt 4 cord. Now instead of having to inventory a Micro USB cable, that I can buy a replacement for anywhere, I need to inventory a one-of-kind cord that I can't buy anywhere.- To charge it, you need to first pull off the top of the mouse, then remove the 2.4 Ghz USB dongle that is there if you want to use wireless instead of Bluetooth, and then plug into the USB-C port behind it. You don't need to worry about the lid going bad from taking it on and off because it is held down with magnets that work very well and unlikely to give you any issues.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the TECKNET Bluetooth Mouse, and it has quickly become an essential tool in my daily computing routine. As someone who values portability, versatility, and reliability, this mouse checks off many boxes.First and foremost, the setup process was a breeze. Pairing it with my laptop via Bluetooth was quick and hassle-free. The mouse has maintained a stable connection since day one, without any noticeable drop-offs or lag during use. This is particularly important for me as I often work in different locations and need a reliable wireless mouse.The ergonomic design of the TECKNET Bluetooth Mouse is worth highlighting. It fits comfortably in my hand, and the textured surface provides a secure grip, reducing the chances of accidental slips. The responsive buttons and scroll wheel make navigation and productivity tasks a breeze, whether I'm working on documents or surfing the web.One feature that stands out is the adjustable DPI (dots per inch) settings. With the press of a button, I can switch between different sensitivity levels, which is handy when I need precise control for tasks like graphic design or want faster cursor movement for general browsing. This flexibility caters to a variety of usage scenarios.Battery life has been impressive. I've been using the mouse for several weeks on a single set of AA batteries, and it's still going strong. The automatic power-saving mode helps conserve battery life when the mouse is not in use, which is a thoughtful addition.One minor drawback is the lack of customizable buttons, which some users may desire for specific functions or shortcuts. However, for basic computing tasks, this mouse performs admirably.In terms of aesthetics, the TECKNET Bluetooth Mouse is sleek and understated, fitting seamlessly into any workspace. The build quality feels durable, and it has withstood everyday wear and tear without showing signs of wear.In conclusion, the TECKNET Bluetooth Mouse offers excellent value for the price. It's a reliable, comfortable, and versatile wireless mouse that's well-suited for both work and leisure. Its easy setup, dependable Bluetooth connection, and adjustable DPI settings make it a practical choice for a wide range of users. While it may not have advanced customization options, it more than makes up for it with its overall performance and reliability. If you're in need of an affordable and dependable Bluetooth mouse, the TECKNET Bluetooth Mouse is certainly worth considering.",

                "reviewText": "[update]Exceptional customer support.I require a low profile mouse due to arthritis. I have been using the Microsoft Surface Mouse, but they tend to become unusable after a few months; the buttons quit working well. So I investigated an alternative mouse shaped like the Surface Mouse and found the Insignia mouse at Best Buy. It is almost identical to the Surface Mouse and provides the profile I need so I bought one.As I was browsing Amazon for mice, I came across this Tecknet one and decided to buy one because it appeared to be the same low profile, ergonomic shape I need. I bought one and saw that it is identical to the Insignia and even the covers interchange perfectly. It works well and is accurate enough for what I need a mouse to be.I just got this mouse so I cannot comment on durability/longevity, but I will update this review once I've used it for about 6 months...if it lasts that long. We will see...",

                "reviewText": "This works on PC and Mac, but I got this because of the Bluetooth ability, which is crucial for Macbook users as this will free up the USB port previously devoted to the mouse connection. (Still only have two USB ports, but way better than one).Light weight with a good looking design, although I do have an issue with the metal scroll wheel not providing enough traction to control the rotation with confidence. As a result, sometimes there is a tendency to press down too hard on the wheel and turned the scroll action into a click.To access the charging port and/or the USB transmitter, you use the plastic tab on the left to lift up the top cover. I imagine they put the tab there so you know how it works the first time. The cover will reattach easily with a clever magnetic connection. This leaves only one exposed switch on the bottom of the mouse for selecting Bluetooth/USB connection.So far so good. It works, it's quiet and responsive. And like I said, I now have access to my two USB ports!",
