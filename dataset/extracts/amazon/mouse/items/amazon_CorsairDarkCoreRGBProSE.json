                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Wireless heavy gaming mouse for large hands.",
                "reviewText": "First things first. I needed a large mouse for large hands and I finally stumbled upon this gem of a mouse that feels like it was made for me. (I was using a G502 previously and found it to be to small). So I decided to buy it and found out that it sold out literally everywhere at my place. So I had it shipped to my country through Amazon Global standard shipping(through Aramex) . Arrived a week early and was well packaged but the box had to opened for a customs check. No items were missing , so good.The mouse is really well built and is a bit on the heavier side but I like my mice heavy. The ergonomics are really perfect for large hands (hand size: 19.5x10cm) and the included pinky rest is a lifesaver for both gaming and work. The mouse feet are really smooth, in fact too smooth that I had to lower my sensitivity lol. All buttons can be customized with Corsair iCUE quick and easy and if you need macros that can be done within the software as well. Some features can be saved to the mouse on-board memory profiles (up to 3) so you do not need the software all the time. RGB is bright and beautiful. The outer body has a textured plastic that is miles better than rubber.Wireless : Corsair slipstream is truly an achievement and I found no difference in performance when using the mouse in both wired and wireless mode. iCUE is only required for the pairing the mouse and the dongle. After that you can turn the software off if needed. I've had some lag (that goes away after 5-10 secs) when trying to use the mouse after the computer starts up or awakens from sleep mode however this is a standard phenomena that occurs with all wireless mice. The mouse is a breeze to use without wires. (the included wire is too stiff and can push the mouse on a flat surface if it gets coiled)Battery and charging: Battery life is average. Mouse lasts for about 9-10hrs with all lights turned on and takes about 2-3 hrs to fully charge. Wireless charging is OK , it takes a bit of time but its really well implemented and mouse lights up white to let you know it it is charging wirelessly with any Qi certified charger. Note: There is no percentage indicator letting you know how much battery is left even in software unfortunately.Miscellaneous issues : I have heard of issues of accidental right click and mushy switches in some reviews. At least in my unit , I haven't had such experiences....yet. (will update if any occurs).Cons: The Corsair iCUE software is a pain to use and it literally crashes my PC when trying to game. Button mapping although easy to do gets ages to save in the software and I finally decided just to save it to the onboard profile instead. Also one major problem I found - If you have a low end PC and you also have other corsair peripherals such a s a Corsair keyboard , the software forces you to save multiple (unnecessary) profiles to both software and onboard memory of BOTH keyboard and mouse to function properly. If it is not done it causes a lot of software glitches and unresponsiveness of keys on the keyboard and DPI buttons on the mouse. Also if you uninstall iCUE with keyboard and mouse connected , It will take away the RGB of both devices for some reason. There is also a bug that says 'your profiles are not saved , go to device settings to save' even if I saved the profile to mouse multiple times. The profiles will work but it is an annoyance to see that pop up again. I strongly recommend you disable the software after you have done all your mapping, wireless and macros if you are on a low end device.Verdict: Overall the best ergonomic mouse that I have laid my hands on. They don't make mice like these anymore after most \"pro's\" switched to ultralightweight mice. Good modular support and ease of use. Only held back by the horrible iCUE software. (P.S -pretty much all mouse software have some issues...although my review thrashes iCUE , I just want you to know that no software is perfect even if it is from Logitech or Razer , it is just a matter of getting used to it until they fix it ).I recommend this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I'm not the most coordinated person. Tripping over shoelaces is basically an Olympic sport for me, so you can imagine the carnage my mouse used to endure. Wired cords were death traps, tangled messes that sent my cursor flying off into oblivion mid-raid. Enter the Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE: wireless freedom and pinpoint accuracy in a sleek, comfy package.This mouse is a game-changer (literally). The wireless connection is rock-solid, no lag or jitters even during the most intense boss battles. And the sensor? Razor sharp! I can headshot gnomes from across the map now, which is definitely a confidence booster (and probably annoys my teammates, but hey, winning!). Plus, the Qi charging is a godsend. No more fumbling with cables, just plop it on the charging pad and boom, ready to go for another round.So, if you're a fellow klutz like me, or just someone who appreciates a top-notch gaming mouse, do yourself a favor and check out the Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE. It's a game-changer, even for the most butter-fingered adventurers.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great hardware, buggy software.",
                "reviewText": "After about a year of use I can confirm that the mouse is great! Customizable grip, battery lasts for a long time, button placement is ergonomic and all of the buttons feel nice. It has nice uniform lighting, comes with a long braided cord, the mouse glides smooth, the cord and mouse are USB-C, and the dongle easily fits inside the mouse so your won't lose it while traveling. It also feels great with any grip type, loose, claw, fingertip, natural, etc., and the overall weight and balance feel superb, as well as the material around the mouse. It works great for long gaming sessions or twelve hours of office work. You can code macros to help with Excel tasks, open a specific app, or have a different set-up for each game you play. Overall the hardware engineering that went into the mouse is 11/10, and the components are durable. That being said...The only downside is that Corsair can't or won't fix the bug that's been in their software since it was created in 2018. It just doesn't play nice with any version of Windows consistently. Four people in my house all have different hardware and software configurations, and we've experienced this bug with multiple PCs and laptops for over five years now. When you boot your PC iCue sometimes won't load at all or won't detect some or all of the Corsair hardware. Mouse, keyboard, mousepad, RAM, fans, AIO cooler, headset etc. The only way to fix it is to reboot the PC or hope that unpluging and repluging in the device works. This not only affects lighting, but fan and pump settings, keyboard and mouse bindings, and general operation of the device. Sometimes the mouse won't even work, because the software won't detect it. Dozens of My friends have had this issue. It happens at least once a week on Windows 10 and 11. Doesn't matter what hardware you have, and no amount of troubleshooting fixes it. Corsair is the only option if you want a centralized, single program controlling all of your devices. RAZER products are borderline garbage at this point and typically breakdown within six to eight months of regular use, and their software is basically bloatware that data mines your PC constantly. Logitech makes hardware that lasts seemingly an eternity, but their software is lacking options, confusing and dated. So when Corsair's software works you've got the best of the best with a mostly user friendly interface. Choose your poison I guess. I wish they'd fix the heart of their ecosystem instead of sinking millions a month into making new products that'll all have the same problem, but this is your best option overall.I've been repairing, testing, and building PC's components and peripherals since the 90's, so I still get very much hands on with RAZER, Logitech, and Corsair products for work and personal use. From replacing semiconductor components and capacitors to resoldering replacement switches and diodes, to fixing software bugs when possible. Corsair uses high grade components for their hardware, and their hardware engineers seem to be top notch from the work that I've seen. In my experience, they're the best.",

La iluminaci\u00f3n RGB es bastante brillante y se ve muy bien, puedes configurarla a tu gusto o apagarla si lo deseas y cuenta con perfiles seleccionables en los que puedes configurar la iluminaci\u00f3n, los dpi las acciones de los botones y dem\u00e1s de acuerdo a tu gusto, excelente para videojuegos y tambi\u00e9n para trabajo y productividad pues puede conectarse mediante Slipstream de Corsair usando el receptor USB incluido cuando buscas el m\u00e1ximo rendimiento, o por Bluetooth que te permite un poco m\u00e1s de duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda y un gran desempe\u00f1o para trabajar en tu dispositivo. No tengo ninguna queja, es un dispositivo excelente",
