                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best mouse I've ever used",
                "reviewText": "I have owned the previous MX Master for over two years. It was amazing in pretty much every respect. Over time it got scratched up from being in my travel bag so when the new version came out, I jumped on it. I've had no regrets since. It's everything the original version offered plus more.The MX Master 2S is overall unchanged physically. Same button placement, same shape, same size. The only identifiable thing are the new colors. The previous black+bronze was nice but curious color choice - a bit steampunk if you ask me. The new color options, blue, white, and black on graphite (my choice) is a more traditional color for peripherals.In terms of buttons, it's the same as the previous model - two main buttons on top, scroll wheel that acts as a third button and a wheel lock button to freespin the wheel when you need it. The main two top buttons feel clickier or crisper than my previous mouse. I don't know if Logitech changed the mechanism or my old mouse is just worn out. However the more tactile feel is a welcome change. The free spin button is something unique that I have not seen on any other mouse. Normally the wheel is a friction wheel offering bumpy tactile feel. This is useful for precise scrolling. When you click the center button, the mouse releases the friction of the mouse and allows it to free spin. This is immensely useful if you need to scroll quickly for large spreadsheets, documents, or webpages. I am a photographer and designer and having free spin is great for changing brush sizes, brush hardness, opacity, and other options in photo editing programs.There is also a horizontal scroll wheel and two buttons on the thumb. Admittedly I barely ever use the thumb scroll but it's a useful wheel to have to assign it to creative uses. The two forward and backward buttons unfortunately haven't changed at all. Most people complained about the size and shape of these. It's hard to touch-press them unless you're very used to the mouse. This has not changed at all. These buttons really need to be larger.Finally there is a hidden \"gesture\" button on thumb pad underneath the soft rubber. You push down to switch between windows in Windows 10. Alternatively you can assign this to something more useful. I almost never use it since I alt-tab everything. If you didn't know this button was there you would probably miss it. It is well hidden and the press down is awkward. Either way, it's an extra button you can use creatively.Overall the mouse design is excellent. The size is perfect and the slightly slanted wedge design is great to save your wrists from carpal tunnel injury over long time use. This is SIGNIFICANTLY better than a traditional flat mouse (I'm looking at you Apple Magic Mouse). While it's not a perfectly vertical mouse, it's large enough for your hands to cup it naturally and pivot on your wrist bone for more precise movements with less pain.My favorite feature is the multi-system switch button. On the bottom there is a button to switch between 3 systems. Previously there was a separate connect button that Logitech smartly did away with. Now there is just one button, press once to switch between 1, 2, or 3, and hold down to put the mouse in search/connect mode for a new device. This feature is simply amazing. I have a desktop, a laptop, and my fiance has a laptop. We all have each system assigned to a number. Simply one press will let you seamlessly switch between systems. There is no lag. There is no delay. There is no reconnect. Once you've paired it, you never have to do it again. The mouse works with Logitech's universal dongle as well as bluetooth. Honestly bluetooth is all you ever really need. I have the dongle on my desktop and just use bluetooth on the two other laptops. This is by far the BEST FEATURE of this mouse. I don't need to buy extra mice for other systems, I just take the same mouse with me.The mouse also works on pretty much every surface I've tried it on. I have a black table and several mice have given up working on it. They work for a bit but loose their way. I've tried this on really dark furniture, mouse pads, and even glass. It takes all surfaces like a champ!The second best feature is the battery. I have used other wireless mice such as Razr, other Logitech, and Apple. The batteries for these mice area lacking in battery life. Nothing is worse than working or playing a game and the battery dies mid-way. Typically those batteries last a few days at best. The MX Master 2S WILL LAST YOU WEEKS. I got mine two weeks ago and I still haven't charged it since. If it does die, it will prompt you on screen and you can charge while you continue working.Overall this is the best wireless mouse I've ever used. I would not hesitate to buy it. It is a bit pricey though, for good reason. If you can find it on sale, DEFINITELY buy! You won't look back!If this review helped, or managed to get this far, why not give me me a like? Thanks :)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite mouse",
                "reviewText": "I have been using an original MX Master (which I\u2019ll call MXM for brevity) at the office for the past three years and it is by far my favorite mouse, until the MX Master 2 (though for my uses they are largely the same).Scroll wheels on mice have been a real pain for me in the past, it seems like scroll wheels on every mouse I\u2019ve used prior to the MXM were junk. They were always janky where clicks wouldn\u2019t register, or scrolling just wasn\u2019t smooth. I was talking with a guy at work a few years ago about this and he let me test-drive his MXM for an hour and I loved it, so I immediately purchased one.I have used it with zero problems for the last few years, and I\u2019m still addicted to quickly scrolling through web pages, code files, spreadsheets, etc by using the smooth-as-butter quick scrolling feature. For me the scroll wheel alone is worth the price, but of course it has plenty of other really useful features.At home I was using an MX Anywhere mouse because I travel frequently, so the smaller form-factor is nice. However, it does feel a bit too cramped and when I use it I miss the ergonomics and smooth scrolling. I finally decided to get another MX Master (this one being the MX Master 2). I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t buy this sooner!It\u2019s basically the same as the original MXM with a few added features. The MXM 2 supports \u201cFlow\u201d software which allows you to seamlessly use the mouse across multiple computers (up to three) without having to manually change the connection on the bottom of the mouse. You can also copy and paste files across multiple computers, provided you copy/paste by using the mouse itself rather than keyboard shortcuts. The MXM 2 also supports higher resolution (up to 4,000 DPI) and longer battery life.The thumb gesture button on the MXM 2 does feel a slight bit mushier than the original but for me it's easier to click. I see a lot of people complaining about the forward/back thumb buttons being set too far back making them uncomfortable to use, but I have adapted to using them a bit differently. Rather than pulling my thumb back and searching for the correct button I simply keep my thumb in its natural position and rock it up/down, letting the side of my thumb hit the buttons. It only took me a short time to get used to doing it this way, but it feels completely natural.This mouse is super comfortable to use all day long. It is a bit on the larger side so if you have smaller hands then it might not be ideal for you.The MXM really does work on every surface I\u2019ve tested on. My coffee table has a glass top and no other mouse works fluidly on it, except the MXM series.I don\u2019t do much PC gaming outside of playing Civ, which doesn\u2019t require twitch accuracy, but I\u2019ve heard a number of people say it\u2019s not an ideal gaming mouse. I will take their word for it, so if you\u2019re looking for a gaming mouse then I\u2019d do a little more searching around. That being said, for productivity it works flawlessly.Finally, if you have an original MXM and it\u2019s still working well for you then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth upgrading unless something like Flow is something you will find really useful.",

                "reviewText": "I use this mouse daily and it's wonderful. Paired with the Logitech app that allows you to customize what the buttons do and their res[ective sensitivities, you get the feeling that this mouse can do it all. The battery life after a full charge lasts me weeks. Since it is in a slightly more favourable ergonomic position\u2014but far from vertical\u2014I noticed that my wrist doesn't hurt anymore, which is a huge plus.One thing that I do not like is the location of the horizontal scroll wheel. I have large hands and I feel as if the button could have been placed more forward on the mouse. I find that every time I reach for the horizontal scroll wheel, I overshoot it and have to move my thumb back. I can't seem to ever get it on the first try.Overall, a great mouse with tons of customization",

                "reviewText": "Works really well. The tracking is nice and works on multiple surfaces I checked on. The mouse is a little heavy but that works well with the good tracking as the mouse feels good in your hand, more natural than an ultra-light mouse.The buttons are satisfying but not very silent. The extra keys are easy to program and useful. The horizontal scrolling wheel is extremely useful. The vertical scrolling wheel is satisfying and the best I've used so far (second only to the Surface Mouse). The flick to scroll function on the main scroll wheel works well.The push to press button in the thumb part of the mouse is not the easiest to press. It takes a bit of effort and an odd angle with your thumb which makes the gestures a little less seamless.One of the side buttons is hard to press but that's useful as you don't end up clicking it by mistake. I still would have liked better shaped buttons on the side.The software is good (but a little heavy) and the drag and drop feature across computers is really useful. However, it doesn't save your settings on the mouse so you have to modify it and setup on each computer.Charging is extremely fast and the cable (despite micro-USB) is really nice.",
