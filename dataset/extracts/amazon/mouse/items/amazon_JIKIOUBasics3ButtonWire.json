                "reviewText": "Had these for a few months now (ordered in April), and really like the style. A bit smaller, which I like, but works well and the click (slightly louder, as some reviews have mentioned) doesn't bother me.However, earlier this week (after about 3 months of use), the mouse started disconnecting from my computer, and reconnecting works temporarily. It seems the USB connection has an issue, as the problem has occurred on multiple PCs. One down, one to go. Still, for the price, it's not a bad deal, but one would think the product would last a bit longer than 2 1/2-3 months.",
