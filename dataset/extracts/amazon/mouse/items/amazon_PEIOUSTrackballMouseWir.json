It automatically shuts down charging to protect itself if you do that, so you think it should be fully charged and NOTHING happens. I've started to do the return process TWICE because of this (maybe I need a sticky note on my monitor) before realizing what I did.I bought this to replace a Logitech M570 that's been starting to have issues, and I think I might like it better.

                "reviewText": "I have gotten so used to Microsoft Ergo keyboards in the last 20-30 years that I have to have the split to be able to type effectively, but they are expensive and I typically keep at least one new in box for when they crap out. I have a 65\" Sony TV in the bedroom, and it seems no sooner than I get in bed I need something else that neither my cell phone or Kindle will handle. So, I added a Geekom Mini Air 11 for $129, which is perfect. But now to make it very user friendly I needed a full sized ergo keyboard, USB wireless, and backlit. Got that. To complete the picture I needed a USB wireless trackball. I have several Logitechs and others and this one was dedicated to bedroom. Left ball, top buttons, scroll wheel. I noticed this one for a few dollars extra with a disply light and rationalized how handy it would be to find among the covers and two Chihuahuas. This one is it. I love it. Feels just like my Logitech, charges from a S cord (of which I have several, right by the bed, for Kindles, flashlights, bluetooth headphones). This is just what the doctor ordered! Great price. Total no brainer!",

                "reviewText": "I'm an avid trackball user as I spend many hours on my computer for work and this eliminates any wrist discomfort. If you are a new to trackballs, it takes a couple days to get used to the thumb movement but ABSOLUTELY worth it. As for this particular mouse, great buy! I found it on Prime Day and needed another to replace my 5 year old previous version. This is the first I've owned that is rechargeable meaning previous models were powered by a aaa battery where this comes with a USB cord for charging. So far, I've owned the mouse for a week with non-stop daily use and have yet to recharge it (after an initial charge out of the box). The nice thing is the cord is long and can easily be used while charging. The ball is smooth and responsive as expected and I was pleasantly surprised by the feel of the 'click' for the buttons. Rather than your typical loud click, this has a softer feel with virtually no sound. The haptic feedback is more than enough to know you pressed it but it's nice being so quiet. Lastly, the color on the edge is a nice touch and customizable. I would absolutely recommend this mouse.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked it until it started acting funky after only 4 months of use. I don't know how to explain it... The ball would spin but the cursor wouldn't move far. I took the ball out and cleaned it and charged it overnight but nothing has helped. I increased the speed of the mouse on my computer settings as far as it would go and that helped a little bit but I still have to spin the ball a lot to get the cursor where it needs to go. It just started doing that yesterday so it's gotta be a defect with the mouse. I had to \"same day\" order a different mouse today so I can effectively work. Super disappointed that this mouse lasted 4 months. I wouldn't recommend this mouse.",

They acted like they hadn't been cleaned in forever, even though I cleaned them out constantly. So, I decided to try this brand, and it's been great! Battery life is good, but you can plug it in and keep using it even when it runs out. I'm going to buy another one for my work computer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this trackball and a name-brand Elecom EX-G trackball at the same time for comparison's sake as they are almost the same price ($30 for the Elecom and $36 for this) and I've had good luck with other Elecom trackballs. I can say that both perform very well and are quite similar in layout and function, though I do enjoy the LED lighting on this trackball. They both use identical (interchangeable) balls, have the same number of buttons, have forward/back buttons and a DPI selector. --It's clear the Elecom was the basis for this trackball's design. Probably the biggest advantage this trackball has over the Elecom is the wide selection of connnections; the Elecom only has 2.4 GHz wireless (With a USB dongle) connectivity, while this trackball has two different Bluetooth connections and the wireless dongle to choose from, plus it has a built-in rechargeable cell while the Elecom uses a single AA. Some people may prefer the AA since it future-proofs the Elecom against the eventual failure of the built-in rechargeable cell, however for this price it's not really a big deal.To sum up, they both seem to perform quite well for a very reasonable price-- having Bluetooth connection options is a pretty big advantage, and that's the main thing that really made me prefer this trackball over the Elecom EX-G. One thing I really would have appreciated is the ability to use either of them as wired trackballs too, so it's unfortunate that this trackball didn't take advantage of its USB-C connection used for charging to also allow wired operation.",
