                "reviewText": "The Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse has completely transformed my computing experience. As someone who spends long hours working at a computer and has used an Apple Magic Mouse for years, I was in search of a mouse that would prioritize comfort and ergonomic design without compromising on functionality. I am delighted to say that the MX Vertical has exceeded my expectations on all fronts!First and foremost, the ergonomic design of this mouse is exceptional. I have very large hands and was concerned that the ergonomics wouldn't line up with what I am working with for my body. This was not the case at all. The vertical orientation promotes a more natural handshake position, reducing strain on my wrist and forearm. It has made a noticeable difference in alleviating discomfort and fatigue after long hours of usage. The textured rubber surface provides a secure grip, further enhancing comfort.The wireless functionality is incredibly convenient. The mouse connects seamlessly to my computer via Bluetooth (or the included USB receiver), allowing for clutter-free desk space. The wireless range is impressive, and I've experienced no lag or connectivity issues. The rechargeable battery lasts for an extended period, eliminating the need for frequent replacements and reducing waste. My magic mouse was a battery burner and I would have to recharge those batteries frequently.In terms of precision and performance, the MX Vertical is outstanding. The high-precision sensor ensures smooth and accurate tracking and I've not experienced any issues in those areas. I programmed the customizable buttons and scroll wheel to better suit my needs, which was very simple to do. You can also easily adjust the sensitivity to your liking.The build quality of this mouse is excellent. It feels solid and durable in hand, giving it a premium and reliable feel. The thoughtful placement of buttons and ergonomic contours demonstrates Logitech's attention to detail in crafting a product that prioritizes both form and function.The Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse is a worthy investment. I don't regret my choice to try something new!",

                "reviewText": "Love this mouse! It is so different from the traditional mouse, but it didn't take me more than a day to get used to the very different configuration. It feels so natural to the hand and eliminates so many issues with a flat mouse. It looks strange but is wonderful once you get used to it. I love that it's rechargeable and accomplishes a full charge in a very short time. It glides on the mouse pad and I rarely lose the mouse pointer on the screen. It's great for gaming, too. Very comfortable. Definitely a Cadillac of mice! It's responsiveness is wonderful. Highly recommend. I have tendonitis and the mouse has improved my symptoms.",

                "reviewText": "Having been a heavy computer user for more than 30 years, I developed a damaged right hand ulnar (pinky) nerve. The constant left-right swiping of a regular mouse (mainly right) put so much strain on my ulnar nerve. I use a brace to help, but still using a conventional mouse was not helping matters. My physical therapist suggested I try and find an alternative to a conventional mouse. I decided to try a vertical mouse.The major advantage to a vertical mouse is I no longer use move my wrist left and right to move the mouse. I use my whole arm. While it takes a few days to get used to the motion, it has put far less strain on my ulnar nerve.As for this mouse specifically, it is great. I can connect via usb, bluetooth, or the included Logitech Unifying receiver. All three work just fine for me. It fits my hand and grip well and I can still use my computer without worry of the continual strain on my ulnar nerve. Even when playing my game of choice, World of Warcraft, I have adapted to the same game play I had with a regular style mouse.**update as of 3/8/2023Having used this mouse daily for the past three-four years I just want to offer up some observations. First, the mouse still works except for the scroll wheel being a bit janky every now and then. It appears to be a dust issue as I blow out the wheel when it gets bad and it works for a few months without issue. The rubberized outside has held up quite well considering my hand oils usually destroy the surfaces of previous mice I have used. The battery lasts about two months on a full charge. About 1/3 less than it did when new. This is expected. I paid $99 new and feel the price was well worth it considering the wrist strain it helped resolve and it is still working well. I have large hands and this mouse is great for me. Logitech has a smaller/cheaper version of a vertical mouse that looks to be better suited for smaller hands. One final note, I have become accustomed to using my index finger for both the \"left\" mouse click and the scroll wheel. I initially tried to use my middle finger for the scroll wheel but it was very uncomfortable. I use my middle finger for the \"right\" mouse button and this also has worked well for me. Making things very comfortable and easy to maneuver. YMMV. Don't hesitate getting this mouse if you are looking for a vertical one. Don't be afraid to pay the price as it should last quite some time.",

                "reviewText": "The most standout feature of this product, is of course, the ergonomic design. I am a student who spends a lot of time on my PC for school, and I do a lot of PC-gaming in my free time. After many years of wrist pain, which was partially solved through other means, this mouse fixed the rest of it. If you spend a lot of time on your computer, and find that the wrist that you use your mouse with hurts, this is a top-tier choice of ergonomic mice.In terms of gaming, I have not noticed any downsides to using this mouse, although there is a small learning curve. If you are worried, perhaps use the mouse for non-games for a little while first, and some less competitive games, while your brain adjusts your muscle memory. I would say that within a week or two, using this mouse is second-nature, even after using normal mice for many years. I have not noticed any latency, even when specifically looking for it.Lastly, the battery life is unbelievable. I have not purposefully tried to test it, but I have probably charged it twice times within the ~4 months of owning it, and not always to full charge. I leave it on between uses too, so it probably does conserve a lot of power when not in use.Overall, I would recommend this mouse as a first-choice to anyone interested in an ergonomic mouse. If you spend lots of time at your PC, and will continue to do so for years, the price is a non-issue.",
