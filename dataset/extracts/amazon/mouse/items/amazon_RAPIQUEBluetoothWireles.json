                "reviewText": "I impulsively purchased this mouse after my previous one's scrolling wheel broke. Surprisingly, it has exceeded my expectations, serving me well for work, school, and gaming. Not only does it boast an appealing design, but it also offers excellent functionality, featuring quiet clicking and smooth scrolling. The rechargeable battery lasts for weeks, and I'm surprised it hasn't garnered more reviews given its affordability and quality. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity.",

                "reviewText": "So far I am loving this mouse.Great price, awesome color, feels comfy in my rather large hand. Nice surface feel, moves quite smoothly, very respinsive. Top buttons have a nice click, and not a lot pressure needed to depress them.Wheel has a nice sound, feel and movement. The button behind the wheel allows you to set the dpi to three different settings.Has a bright RGB light on the mouse. This is definitely a love or hate thing. I am not a fan, but not a deal breaker.I love that you can sync via bluetooth (actually have two BT connections) no dongle, or 2.4gHz with dongle. Both wireless options connect easily, had some issues at first with dropping BT connection, but for whatever reason worked itself out.Two more buttons on the side, and is rechargeable via USB-C cable. The bonus is, unlike an Apple mouse, you can still use the mouse while charging. Though I have not had it drop out while using it, I have gone well over a week of daily use, before I just connected it to charge it up.Going to be honest, this is a heck a of a fun mouse, with a a really nice set of specs. For a silly low price.For most people, this a very cool, useful mouse. It feels good in the hand, it is really light, but not terribly so.I did not use this for gaming, but suspect for most, but would work fine.It is not $100 quality, but also not cheap, cheap either.So in summary, you get a lot of nice options, in a good looking, nice feeling mouse. Definitely worth the investment.",

I love the colors (I work on a lot of dark surfaces or from couches and I've misplaced mice in the past because they've camouflaged - I don't have to worry about that with this mouse - EVEN when the cute LEDs are off).I don't know how to program the side buttons and nothing in the manual explains them. I spent 25 minutes digging through my computer settings to try and figure it out, but I had no luck.So far, great buy for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Small and comfortable in my kids hands and my own as well. Silent clicking but with tactile feedback. Glides smoothly and color changing LED is a nice touch. It connected immediately with 2.4ghz USB dongle. Haven't really tried bluetooth connection but 2.4 has less lag anyway. It could be a great gaming mouse but I haven't figured out how to assign actions to the side buttons in Windows. Physically similar to Logitech Lightspeed but less than half the price. So far it has lasted a week on a charge without ever turning it off. I replaced a generic corded mouse, but with a slide out keyboard tray, the cord kept catching on things. Problem solved with this sweet cordless mouse.",
