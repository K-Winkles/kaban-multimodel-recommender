I don't understand at all how these have not gotten more attention (but glad they haven't - haha). Cord is even a very nice braided one (and I have the wireless version as well - equally great). Would take this over the Logitech G502 x1000 I do miss that slightly velvety texture my Death Adder and Mionix had (but then, that finish is never that durable either - so not really a bad thing that the EVGA doesn't have it) and the EVGA's plastic does have a nice micro-texture to it (reminds me of high end pbt keycaps tbh) and some really sturdy rubber grips that make the mouse a joy to use - and the EVGA's shape is even more comfortable in hand (much more so than the G502, and even more than my older Mionix (or Death Adder).",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Hard as Heck to Get Working.... But AMAZING Once You Fix it! (THIS REVIEW CONTAINS THE SOLUTION)",
                "reviewText": "Be prepared for all this... Would probably be a good idea to get yourself a bag of popcorn or some other snack for this lengthy readthrough, haha.So basically, this mouse arrives without the buttons bound to what you desire, and is set to 1000hz polling rate by default. The problem is that if you happen to have the latest Windows 10 Updates (that started deploying in like March or April 2021), the EVGA Unleash RGB X17/20 software does not work....at all...no matter what... This is due to the software not detecting the mouse on newer versions of Windows, as the mouse's firmware needs to be updated...via the software that isn't working... But once the mouse's firmware is updated, the system will then detect the mouse and the app will magically start working- no joke.But due to those newer builds of Windows having updated versions of Microsoft .NET Framework, you cannot easily get the app's Firmware Updater (in the \"Program Files (x86)\\EVGA\\Unleash RGB\\FWUpdate\" folder to work... And it also won't automatically happen in the Unleash RGB x17/20 RGB software since the software won't launch.... So essentially, you have to have access to a dang computer that's running an older version of Windows 10 (or any other, older versions of Windows as they may potentially still work; I imagine this is due to those older Win10 builds having older versions of Microsoft .NET Framework built-in). Luckily enough, I had a spare laptop that was running a version of Windows 10 from about a year ago. I installed EVGA Unleash RGB X17/20 and it actually opened fine, without any issues! Just after opening, it instantly detected the mouse this time and immediately asked me to update the mouse'sfirmware. I did, and then waited for it to finish... After it was done, I changed it to 8,000hz polling rate, hit \"Apply\" and then \"Save,\" and then unplugged the mouse and plugged it back into my primary PC. I used it to reinstall the EVGA Unleash RGB X17/20 software (as I had uninstalled it prior), and it this time the software opened immediately as it detected the mouse with the newer firmware installed.So all in all, the setup for this mouse was super dang annoying... But once I got it working- my god. It's fantastically good! I previously had a Logitech G502 for like...ever lol; but then switched to a Viper 8K.... But I really started missing the G502's design and so I snagged this EVGA X17 as it's shaped similarly and isn't ambidextrous like the Viper 8K. And man, do I love this freaking mouse now! 8,000hz Polling Rate; 7 extra buttons that can be changed to any key or recorded macros; beautiful exterior coloring (in the grey model, which is what I choose); three sensors in the bottom (I imagine for increased tracking with more accuracy); lightweight (that can also be made heavier with the included weight set); and a non-ambidextrous shape that feels better and more tangible in my right hand with my odd mouse grip lol.Overall, this mouse is AMAZING. BUT, it's only amazing WHEN YOU GET IT WORKING. If you're thinking about upgrading to an 8,000hz polling rate mouse, definitely snag this one if you're not used to an ambidextrous mouse. But aside from that, Razer mice also run this crazy software/services in the background of your computer at all times that waste a bit too many resources if you don't know how to close them out/stop them. So if you're into computer performance whilst gaming, then this EVGA mouse would definitely take the cake!Okay, wow... Sorry for writing so much... I hope this helps someone out in the future!Take care everyone who got this far in the read lol *high five*",

                "reviewText": "I have owned various products by EVGA over the years and all of them have been really great products. This mouse is no different. To top it off, I got it for around $25 when it's normally around $80. It fits my hand really good. The RGB isn't over done. At the lowest setting my cursor can zoom across the monitor or I can slow it down almost to a very controlled crawl. I can't attest to how it is while gaming. I've grown up using controllers and find it difficult to use keyboard and mouse. This also means that I can't tell you how well the extra features work. However, it does what I need it to do really well and is a solid build.",

                "reviewText": "The Good - this mouse feels good in the hand, wasn't that expensive when I bought it, the software kind of sucks, but works well enough to get it configured.The Bad - the scroll wheel is the weak spot in this mouse. I'd noticed my mouse wasn't consistently scrolling recently, and when I searched, I found several hits one of which took me to the EVGA forums where there's been an on-going discussion about this mouse dating back to 2021 where the symptom is that the mouse button/scroll stops working.Sadly, I bought this mouse about 3-4 months ago, and now the wheel is starting to fail. This is the second EVGA mouse that I've purchased that has failed after 4-6 months (The other was an X-15 MMO mouse). I've had other brands of mice that lasted a year or longer without having issues like this.",
