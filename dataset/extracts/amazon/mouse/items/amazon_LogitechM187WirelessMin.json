I tested it on my desktop computer and also on my Dell CHROME laptop. It works just fine! I rated it 4 stars despite the weak battery because my main concern is its function. I had one before this and it fits my hand, is good for travel. In sum, I like it. Thx Logitech!",

I originally visited a Best Buy store where I viewed all the mouse options, and this was the smallest and lightest wireless mouse with a good brand name. Best Buy wanted $50 for the mouse and would not match Amazon's price. At $19.;99, I feel like I even got a great deal.The only downside is the packaging. The USB receiver is tucked inside the mouse's battery case. The instructions included with the mouse have a bunch of pictures showing that the receiver should be inserted into a laptop, but no verbiage to help find it. I am used to the USB receiver being packaged as a separate item, and thought the vendor had mailed me a mouse with missing parts.",

Viele Menschen m\u00f6gen nicht so gerne gro0\u00dfe Ger\u00e4te, die schwer sind und zur \u00dcberanstrengung der H\u00e4nde f\u00fchren.Diese Maus ist zudem sehr preiswert, sodass ich sie schon mehrfach verschenkt habe.Leider ist sie nicht sehr haltbar. Keine der von mir gekauften M\u00e4use dieses Modells hat l\u00e4nger als drei Jahre gehalten. Aber beim so g\u00fcnstigen Preis finde ich das noch OK.",

Thing to remember is the led for the optical tracking is not in the visible range. Initially when you switch on the device it gives an impression as the battery not working. Only negative point which I could point out is the positioning of the ON/OFF switch. Everytime when I operate it I make a right click accidently. Other than that I couldn't find out anything.",
