They sent me a trouble shooting guide and I was able to get it working shortly after. I use this mouse all day for work and then on my personal computer for gaming in the evenings. This unit runs forever on very brief charges (10-20 minutes) and in almost a year of continuous use it has only died once.The unit goes to sleep when idle, you will need to click it to wake it up. Don't turn it upside down or the laser will blast your eyes. The chrome-like finish is starting to wear off in a small spot where my palm rests.All-in-all, it has been a good little mouse and if it failed now, I feel like I got my moneys worth.",

Lightweight, very sturdy production, rechargeable, unique design, comfortable in small or medium hands, very customizable,works on all surfaces, and decent frequency distance.The reason why it lost the star (which really is no fault of the manufacturing or the device) is strictly because I have very large hands and it's not as comfortable as it could be if it was just scaled .5 longer.I would still 100% recommend it to anybody who wants a wireless mouse that has a ton of capabilities and can be used easily with desktop to laptop.",

                "reviewText": "Alright this mouse looks really cool, it feels great, it glides great. the issue is that the focus of the laser is about 5 mm below the actual base of the mouse. This causes the mouse to receive random inputs as you lift it up to move it across the mouse pad. It is jarring and makes it un usable in my opinion. There is also no documentation. I have no idea what the button at the top does. maybe pairing? Theres also no LED feedback for battery level as far as i know. This is an awesome shell around terrible hardware. i may actually try to tear the guts out of this and replace it with a cheap logitec on the inside. Shame though, no one should have to do this",

Plugged in the usb reciever, turned on the mouse. The red light blinked once, but went off. So It never came on. Tried turning it off and on several times. Turn it on it blinks red once, but goes right back off. So I plugged it back in, thinking maybe it just did not charge. Plugged it in, the light came on and I left it plugged in a couple hours. The charging light was off so I checked it again. Nothing. So no, I am not satisfied with the product, no matter how cool it looks or feels.",

                "reviewText": "I titled this 'For everything except gaming'. First, I'm not a gamer nor do I ever want to be. Sadly, my son is. He said he would not use this mouse for gaming because of the click rate and resolution of the optic. He does crazy drag click and other things I don't know what is. His fancy mouse cost over $100. OK,,,,I have 2 of these and use one on my work computer and one on my personal computer I video edit on. This is comfortable in the hand. It is wireless. It goes to sleep mode in about 5 minutes of no use which preserves the battery life. It is rechargeable via a USB-C. It can be used while charging if your cord is long enough. Let's talk about battery life... The one I use on my work computer I use all day every day. I charge it once a week. The one on my personal computer gets used in evenings only and some evenings not at all. It needs charged 2 times a week. Well way less use. I'm trying to figure that out. Either way. There are several light modes. If you move the mouse and it doesn't light up. Its asleep. Just click a button and there you go.",

                "reviewText": "The design of the mouse was appealing and it performed moderately well for the most part. However, I encountered some issues during use. Specifically, the placement of the power switch on the underside made it prone to accidental shut-offs when I was sliding the mouse. Additionally, prolonged use led to discomfort in my hand. After about a month of use, the mouse failed to charge, rendering it unusable. Given these issues, I cannot recommend this product for long-term use.",
