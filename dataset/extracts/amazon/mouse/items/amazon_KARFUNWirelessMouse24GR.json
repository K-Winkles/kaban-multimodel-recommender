                "reviewText": "I feel like this mouse is a little too small for adults, but it was perfect for my son's gaming set up! It matched perfectly with his mechanical keyboard. He loves cats so he absolutely loved that this mouse has a little paw on it. We were both excited for the bright colors when the mouse lights up. It was super easy to connect through the bluetooth adapter. The battery lasts a decent amount of time (for us it is a couple of days). It is easy to recharge and it's good to go in a few hours of charging. It's definitely not the fanciest mouse but it's a fun, functional, good quality mouse.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse to replace one that suddenly stopped working, and so far so good. It took quite awhile to fully charge, which tells me the battery life is probably really good on this one. Unlike the one it replaced, the scroll wheel on this one is very comfortable. There are (optional) lights on the mouse to give it a nice glow, which again, is more to my liking than the one it replaced. I may actually turn on the lights on this mouse.As a mouse it seems to work great. Nice and responsive. It has a nifty button I've never seen before that if you hit it, it immediately iconifies your whole desktop, and press it again and it brings everything back (similar to pressing on the far right side of the Windows task bar). I think it also can be used to manage multiple desktops, but I don't use that feature. Nice tough though. It also has a button that changes the sensitivity of the mouse, but I didn't notice a whole lot of difference there.The one really cool extra is that it came with a USB C to standard USB adapter (the receiver that plugs into the computer is standard USB). I don't need that on my current computer, but it's nice that they included the adapter. The documentation that came with the mouse invited me to visit the manufacturer's Facebook page for support, which tells me they are actively supporting the product, which is comforting.The only negative I have is that the box was slightly crushed during shipping, but this is a reflection on Amazon rather than the manufacturer. Everything was fine though.",
