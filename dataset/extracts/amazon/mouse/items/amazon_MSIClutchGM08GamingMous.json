                "reviewText": "I bought this some months back and for the price I couldn't let it go away. For price wow this thing is a beast and it comes with a charging dock so it doesn't use batteries. We all know how batteries can be expensive so this one just charges on its own through the pc. The mouse was not too big and not too small but just right at least for me. The buttons didn't feel cheap and the build didn't either. The scroll wheel was scrolly and very responsive. The mouse had great connectivity and never had any double clicks or any bugs.Pros:Cheap and affordableLightweight mouseComes with charger dockHas rgbCons:Battery life is great but takes a little while to charge from the dockalso rgb was a bit of a con as well because of the softwareThat's it pretty much. I would highly recommend this mouse and anyone wondering to buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I am an occasional gamer, but when I find a game I like I will play it a lot. This mouse has no lag that I can detect, is very light, fits my medium-large man hands fine, and the battery lasts longer than I need in a day. The stand stays put thanks to the rubber feet on the base and acts as an extension for the usb radio dongle.It can be tricky to align the mouse on the stand so it doesn't slide off. However I have not been able to place the mouse on the stand and have it stay put and not make proper contact with the charging pins. That's a good thing as you will not think its charging on the stand when its not.The MSI software is typical bloatware that assumes you are a devotee to their products and own nothing but their products. I installed it, updated the mouse firmware, and then uninstalled it. The 5 DPI presets cover all of my use cases so I found no other value in it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse to replace a $65 mouse that's button switch wore out after 6 months. The primary reason for buying was its low cost made it easily replaceable. It ended up lasting three years.The GM-08 fits my hand really well and moves pretty easily. It features two main buttons, two thumb buttons, a scroll wheel, and a DPI selector. The buttons on the side don't irritate my thumb. The gunk build up on the pads is minimal when I am using a clean SteelSeries glass surface. Like any mouse it builds up sweat residue on the surface. The surface is not coated so it's relatively easy to clean off. A pick is needed to clean out the gaps and the texture on the sides of the mouse. The price is good for what it offers. The main annoyance of this mouse is the DPI setting. It does not remember this setting after rebooting, so it must be set again after a restart.The failure point on this mouse after three years was scroll wheel wear. If I scrolled down, it would reverse up one to two lines. This is perfectly reasonable for the length of time this mouse was in use and the price point it's at.",

The only downside is I have small hands, maybe cause I\u2019m a woman so compared to men, they\u2019d be a bit smaller, so the mouse is really big and bulky so it\u2019s sometimes hard to use all the controls when playing a game that needs quick reflexes. It\u2019s very lightweight as stated in the description so I love that as well as long battery life. Just wish it was more user friendly for most if not all gamer hand sizes. I\u2019ll make it work somehow but just to let anyone out there that have fairly small hands that is may be an issue",
