The problem with doing this is that I then have to take two receiver units. With the Arteck mouse, I can just take their USB receiver.The Arteck mouse works just as well as the Logitech one does in every respect, for a fraction of the price.I'm very pleased with my purchase and so far, the two Arteck products I've purchased have more than met my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "Really happy with this mouse! It feels very sturdy and well made. The click is really nice, soft, and satisfying. The wheel is smooth, not clicky, which I like. There's no lag. The battery lasts forever - I accidentally left it on all weekend and Monday morning it was working fine. I generally use the main buttons, but the side buttons are perfectly placed for my thumb and have a nice click. I'm a woman with average-sized hands, and the mouse as a whole is ergonomic and fits comfortably in my hand.My only complaint is that, if the USB is plugged in, the track pad on my laptop is automatically disabled. It's kind of annoying, because sometimes when I'm on the go I would like to leave the USB plugged in but not use the mouse. I've been poking around in my settings but can't figure out how to change it, and my previous wireless mouses (mice?) didn't do that.But overall, really happy with this mouse. I haven't had it for long so can't yet speak to its longevity, will update if it dies quickly or something, but I don't expect that as it feels well made.",
