I ordered a specialized mouse directly from a computer company and they messed up the order for unknown reasons and the mouse never arrived. I needed something right away so I went back to my old standard Logitech and it works as expected. I find that with continued , daily use, they wear out after a while (maybe 18 months?) but the price is so good that it is not an issue. Pay attention to the price based on the design. They are all the same but with different art work. The price changes with the artwork so unless you have your heart set on a certain design, shop by price.",
