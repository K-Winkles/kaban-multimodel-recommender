Aschenputtel, a 16 year old girl , is purchased by a horrible woman with two equally horrible daughters, and taken to their home to continue her life of subservience. While completing errands for her mistress, Aschenputtel comes into possession of three magic mice, which uproots her entire world.A story of magic, revenge, and an unending hunger, Mice twists everything you thought you knew about Cinderella into a bloody bow. Power, pain, and the quest for more, and yet more leads many astray as this story wanders to its bloody conclusion.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
