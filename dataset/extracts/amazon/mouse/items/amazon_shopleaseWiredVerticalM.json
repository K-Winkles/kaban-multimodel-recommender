My hand doesn\u2019t hurt anymore and it\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve started using it.I am really glad to have bought this product cuz otherwise I don\u2019t know how I would get through the end of the month.The design also looks really cool and I like that it lights up. It still has that professional feel so I\u2019m not worried about customers saying anything and in fact I\u2019ve gotten components about it.If I had one complaint it\u2019s that in the beginning I had to make sure it was plugged into the computer firmly cuz it would come out but once I fixed that I have had no recurring problems with the connections.The price a\u00f1os was great for the design, the fact that it lights up and the ergonomic feature I thought it would be a lot more but this was actually really affordable. I got mine for $12.60Overall great purchase and great price too!Durability 5/5Price 5/5Comfort 5/5",

                "reviewText": "I ended up buying a second one of these. While not at \"solid\" mouse, it is inexpensive and a pretty good fit for my hand. I also like the angle as it reduces the stress on my wrist. The only thing I didn't like was the mouse switches for the left and right mouse buttons. They had almost no tactile feedback and were silent. I actually like the clickyness that I have with other mice. So, I ended up purchasing replacement switches which I had to solder. Not too difficult, but be warned that in order to take apart the mouse, you have to remove the bottom pads, 4 screws, and then you have to remove the top to get to 2 additional screws so you can remove the side of the mouse. To get to those screws, you have to pop the top (the part where you press down for the left and right mouse buttons). It is held in place by 2 clips that you can access on the underside. You can see in the included photo the 3 top parts separated if you also wish to replace the switches. I ended up using the Kailh GM 4.0 and 8.0 switches. Not sure which I will prefer, but both of those switches offer much better tactile feedback and should have a much greater duty cycle.The switches that were replaced are the smaller ones to the left (in the picture). The red switches are the GM 4.0 and the larger black ones are the 8.0's. I ordered the 8 pack which includes 4 red switches and 4 black switches.",

                "reviewText": "I love vertical mice. I've had a few Ankers over the years. This one looked so similar and the price was fantastic so I took the plunge. I find it fits in my hand the same way. Perhaps it feels slightly less hefty, but I'm very satisfied with the performance. I was experiencing some dancing and mouse wheel 'slippage' but then I tested and replaced the batteries and things were back to normal. (no it doesn't have a low battery warning). I use my mouse all day every day and I don't feel like it uses batteries any faster than it should btw. So I'd say my experience is positive!** update - despite having replaced my batteries, I AM still experiencing wheel slippage -- where I scroll up but it goes down a bit too... this wasn't happening for some time... but something has changed I guess. :(",

That said - just got it and started using it right away. It will take a little while to get used to this different style of mouse but I have to say its super responsive, really comfortable and easy to use. I got it as i have a lot of pain in my hands, lower arm and some in my wrist and it does seem to alleviate that when i use it. It remains to be seen if it completely makes it go away after only using it for awhile but I am feeling confident that its going to be very helpful towards that goal.",
