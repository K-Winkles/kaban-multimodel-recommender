                "reviewText": "I bought this mouse for a dell all-in-one desktop and it didn't work. Apparently, dell only likes dell so I'm using it with my laptop instead. The mouse is larger than I thought and I have small hands so it feels a little clunky. However, it would probably be fine for someone with larger hands. The color (blue) is very nice. It has a sleep function where you have to touch the button in the middle to wake it up. I'm not used to that but it's not a big deal. I had to use it with a mouse pad because it wasn't tracking properly but after a few weeks, it seems to be tracking smoothly without the pad. Overall, it's a decent mouse and the value for the money is worth keeping it.",
