                "reviewText": "I LOVE this mouse. It has replaced my Evoluent Ergonomic mouse as a daily driver (for work - software developer). It's almost replaced my Logitech G604/G602 for gaming (World of Warcraft). I expect it to fully replace my gaming mouse once I re-learn all the muscle memory. If you're a parent looking for a cheap mouse for your kid, you can't go wrong with this one.I wasn't expecting much at this price point, but this mouse is a great option for anybody. It feels good in my large hand, doesn't stress my wrist at all. Cursor tracks great with default settings on lowest sensitivity. Had to download the software from a Chinese website (thank you Google Translate!), but once I got it installed, it's all in English. I was able to re-map the D-stick to numpad keys, which I then keybind in World of Warcraft. It took all of an hour and replaced my old Logitech G602 when it died at a bad time. I'm currently using this to tank mythic+ WoW dungeons, using the D-stick for many core abilities. Much more than I expected for $30, and still the only ergonomic mouse I can find with enough buttons to be useful for WoW.The Cons:* The directional stick ... isn't actually one. It doesn't show up in Windows as an actual directional stick (like an Xbox/PS controller would - with an X and Y axis). Rather, it's just 4 buttons (WASD). For my purposes, this is fine (I want it to just trigger buttons) but still feel I'd be better off with just 5 buttons than the \"D stick that isn't actually a D stick\". Maybe this can be changed in the software and I just didn't dig deep enough? As other reviewers point out, the \"dead zone\" of this D stick makes it feel a bit cumbersome.* The RGB color settings are quite limited. Personally, I don't use any of that. But if you want a super fancy customizable RGB mouse, this isn't the one for you (also, expect to pay at least double).* The software is definitely not nearly as pretty as the Logitech equivalent. Functionally it's comparable (macros, key rebinds, change DPI settings), just not quite as polished. Honestly this didn't bother me at all (I figured it out easy enough), and the mouse will function just fine without the software. You only need the software if you want to customize what each button does. Once that's done, the settings are actually saved to the mouse's internal memory, so you never need the software again!* The button right underneath the scroll wheel is a bit tricky to reach. That's probably by design (the default is for this to change cursor speed/DPI). I have re-bound it to my \"Taunt\" ability in WoW, and sometimes it's hard to reach in the heat of the moment. I am slowly re-leaning how to press it with the underside of my middle finger knuckle which is actually very comfortable/ergonomic.",

                "reviewText": "So i got this mouse because 1 my old mouse ive been using for years and i guess it is at a point where the sweat from my hands got into it causing malfunctions and two, since im getting a new mouse i wanted it to be new.This is one of the only mice of its kind you can find, vertical, and has a thumb stick on the top.And yes, it is a new experience and I like it overall. But theres a few complaints i have.First, and the biggest complaint i have, is the fact the software has macro features. Those are considered cheating. You can simply not use them, but say you are a streamer and you have the driver open to tweak shortcuts and what not, the macros are not even hidden. A viewer can simply report you and the very fact you have these options available would be cause for a ban, your only hope is to ask the game devs to trust you in not using them.My second complaint is that the joystick does not register diagonally. So if up is for W, down S, left A, right D, you cannot push it up and to the right to register a W and a D. It is one or the other. But that isnt really a huge problem for me, you may think that it would be better to just be a D pad, but the joystick is alot easier to use in my opinion. For example, i am playing a FPS game. For me, using the scroll wheel to switch weapons is too difficult so I usually set the switch weapon keybind to one of the side buttons. Well with this mouse, i can set the switch weapon to up on the joystick, and it is so much smoother. In a situation where you need to switch to a pistol, you have no time to waste in feeling the side buttons and pressing the right one, you have no time to take your trigger finger off of the left click to use the scroll wheel. With this, i can simply lift my thumb and push the joystick forward and be ready to shoot before the switching animation is over.Another complaint i have is the scroll wheel itself. It is like the design of the wheel is too long on certain spots, and those grooves will rub against the chassis making it hard to scroll.Other than that? It has been a great new experience and for a pretty cheap price.",

Good grip, usb rechargable (and it even works while charging). It takes a bit to get used to, but once you got it works really well. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I've struggled to find a suitable ergonomic mouse as a person with small hands who plays a lot of games, particularly FPSes. This mouse fits my hands (just over 6in) exceptionally well (note, I think this would be uncomfortable with larger hands!). My biggest complaint is that the left-hand buttons are a bit of a stretch, however that makes them harder to bump, which I appreciate. Otherwise this is the most comfortable mouse I may have have ever used! It's surprisingly good for gaming (much better than I thought) and I find my hands being in less pain means I'm holding less tension and therefore moving better in game, too. One downside is that the software is a bit of a pain to get as there's not an obvious source to download, and it ships with a CD-ROM.",
