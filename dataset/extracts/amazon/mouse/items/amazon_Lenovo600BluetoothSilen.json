                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve got an M1 MacBook Air, and didn\u2019t want to drop big $$ for an Apple Magic Mouse. I also wanted something compact other than a Logitech Pebble. The reviews on this were pretty good, and it was less than $20, so I decided to give it a shot.When I unboxed it, I was a bit disappointed with the cheap feeling plastic and the grey finish. It\u2019s a decent quality mouse, but it looks and feels a bit cheap. The grip is more ergonomic than and Apple mouse or Pebble, but it\u2019s not very comfy to use for hours on end.Bluetooth paired up effortlessly and had no issues. It is one of the quietest clicking devices I\u2019ve ever used, and the battery life seems very good.I wanted a Logitech Pebble when I bought this, but had a trip coming up and needed a mouse in a day, and couldn\u2019t get the Pebble in time, so tried this. It works great, it\u2019s compact, it\u2019s quiet. But it feels cheap compared to the Pebble. This mouse should do just fine for what I need it for, and I\u2019m okay with it. If I had to choose between this and the Logitech, I\u2019d pick the Logitech, but ONLY on the finish and seeming better quality plastic. That\u2019s it. This is a good mouse. It\u2019s Bluetooth, it\u2019s as cheap as Bluetooth mice go, and it works as designed. I\u2019d recommend it for that alone.One important thing - this is a compact mouse. If you\u2019re working on this mouse all day every day, get a regular mouse. The ergonomics are so much better.",

This mouse connected almost instantly with my Pixel 7a, so I'm super happy. There's also a button on the top that lets you pick from 3 different cursor speeds, which is handy because I don't know how I would change that from a phone instead of a laptop. Really easy to set up, and comes with a battery.",
