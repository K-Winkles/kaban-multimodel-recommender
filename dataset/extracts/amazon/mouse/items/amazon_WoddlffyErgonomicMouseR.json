It takes no more space than the other mouse did and it actually feels better in my hand and wrist than the old style did. I find that my wrist is not achy, and I didn\u2019t really realize that it ached before, but it did. It has the same functions and it\u2019s just as easy to set up. It\u2019s a no brainer for me!",

I decided to take a risk and order a no-name product to save some money, and I'm glad that I did! The purple looks great, my hand cradles the mouse well and the sleep functionality appears to work well, though it's hard to tell until I've had it longer.At first, I thought the USB Dongle was missing, but then actually read the directions and realized that it has a storage place in the base of the mouse.

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I'm not new to ergonomic/vertical mice. I've been using them for many years now, and I got this to replace a beloved vertical mouse that was on the fritz after 3 years of use. This one looks nice... but that's about it. As my title says, this is not designed for small hands at all. The mouse doesn't look large at first glance, but I noticed after a couple hours on the first day that my hand was hurting after using it. I chalked it up to \"well, it's just designed differently than my old one, I'll get used to it.\" Well, I didn't get used to it, and I gave it two weeks of use at work. I don't know what it is about the design of this one, but it definitely feels too big in my hand, to the point that my hand is slipping off of it all the time and I have to keep adjusting my grip to feel like my hand is in the right place. It's particularly uncomfortable on the outer side of my hand and my ring finger + pinky finger almost go numb after using it for too long. It's super weird. It's definitely the mouse causing the pain too, because it starts almost instantly when I use the mouse, and goes away pretty fast after I'm done.The other annoying part about this mouse is that it tracks so slooooooooooow. I'm using it on an iMac, and I turned it up to the fastest speed and the mouse is still not fast enough to track across my entire 27\" screen without me having to pick it up and reposition it. This kinda defeats the ergonomics since doing that every 10 seconds makes my wrist hurt, and I have to also keep adjusting my wrist rest. Basically I'm constantly picking this thing up and adjusting my grip, and it's a hassle.Not a fan of the sleep mode either. It goes into sleep mode after a really short period of time--I'm talking like 3-5 minutes, if that. I figured out all you have to do is click a button to wake it up, but it's just kind of a nuisance.So this entire review isn't just me complaining, I will say I like that it's rechargeable and that the black part is a nice rubbery material so it feels higher-end than your typical plastic mouse. It doesn't do much in terms of grip though, as I've said.Anyway, I'm sending this mouse back. I tried it out for as long as I could stand it and it's just not right for me. TLDR; if you have small hands like I do I would not recommend. I bought a different mouse, so I'm crossing my numb fingers that it'll be better than this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently switched to the Rechargeable Ergonomic Vertical Mouse, and the difference it has made in my daily computer use is truly remarkable. This wireless mouse not only delivers on functionality but also prioritizes comfort through its unique ergonomic design.Ergonomic Design:The vertical design of this mouse is a game-changer for anyone who spends extended hours working on a computer. The natural handshake position reduces strain on the wrist and forearm, promoting a more comfortable and ergonomic experience. It took me no time to adapt to the new grip, and now I can't imagine going back to a traditional mouse.Rechargeable Convenience:The built-in rechargeable battery is a fantastic feature. No more dealing with the hassle of constantly changing batteries. A quick recharge and I'm good to go for hours. The battery life is impressive, lasting through even the longest work sessions without needing a charge.Wireless Freedom:The wireless functionality adds to the overall convenience. I appreciate the clutter-free workspace it provides, and the responsive connection ensures smooth navigation. The setup is straightforward, and I experienced no lag or disconnection issues during my usage.Customizable Buttons:The 5-button configuration, including the scroll wheel, provides enough functionality for both work and casual use. The three adjustable DPI settings add an extra layer of customization, allowing me to find the sensitivity that suits my preferences for different tasks, from precise design work to casual web browsing.Quiet and Responsive Clicks:The mouse clicks are surprisingly quiet, which is a plus for shared workspaces or late-night use. Despite the quiet operation, the clicks are responsive and provide the tactile feedback I need for accurate navigation.Quality Build:The build quality of the mouse is impressive. It feels sturdy and well-made, giving confidence in its durability. The matte finish provides a comfortable grip, and the overall construction suggests that it's built to withstand daily use.",

                "reviewTitle": "Ergonomic, inexpensive, but very light",
                "reviewText": "First time I have used this style of mouse and I wanted to get a cheaper version to use it as a \"proof of concept\" item and not waste a multiple of its sale price if the concept was a dud.In my opinion it looks ok, if a tad garish in purple. It also feels good in the hand although it was a little too small for my hands (I would say I have \"average size guy hands\").The mouse has some interesting characteristics in that the mouse buttons and hand surface area feel nice to the touch and in the case of the buttons click well and quietly, but the mouse is almost startlingly light when you pick it up. You'd think from the size of it (it appears larger in total size that a regular mouse) that it would be heavier - by point of contrast, the m510 from Logi feels easily a 1/3 or more heavier in weight. You get the distinct impression that there is nothing much inside (including the size of the battery...) and that the plastic used is thin which does not bode well for any kind of mouse abuse.In use the mouse works well enough but again I would have preferred a more \"solid\" mouse for office use, but that's personal preference. I did not use the mouse in gaming but I would think it would be a decent general purpose optical mouse in that regard. If you're a serious gamer, you'd likely be much happier looking upmarket as it doesn't have the DPI nor the buttons for that class of user.It comes with a short USB C cable and I couldn't see any charging light except through a slit of an opening where two pieces of plastic meet and a red light internally came on while charging.Can't speak to battery life yet and the usb dongle fits into bottom of the mouse when not in use. Range appears to be good enough for desk work. It comes with a on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse which some truly El Cheapo wireless mice do not.Overall, when you compare it to a more premium (and expensive mice) such as the regular styled logi m510, this mouse doesn't have the same level of nice solid feel. But, that being said, it does feel good in hand, the materials are at least decent, and it works well in its ergonomic mission for medium sized hands or smaller - on a mouse pad (it has 4 glide \"feet\" on that didn't work so great on my glass topped wood desk).The saving grace for this mouse is that all of its sins are relatively minor and are redeemed, in my view, because of its $17ish price on sale (for the purple model). Go faster red is another $2.All in all, i'd give it 4 stars with about a quarter of that rating in deference to the price.I'll update to see how it holds up in an office environment after a few months of use.",
