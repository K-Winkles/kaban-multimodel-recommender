                "reviewText": "Let's be real, wired mice are a hassle. They snag on everything, yank your laptop across the desk, and basically scream \"amateur hour.\" That's why I finally caved and snagged this wireless wonder from Redragon \u2013 and let me tell you, it's a game-changer.This little beast glides like a dream, thanks to the super smooth wireless connection. Whether I'm battling bosses in my latest RPG or editing like a madman, it keeps up flawlessly. The battery life is insane too \u2013 I've been using it for weeks without even a hint of needing a recharge. Plus, the customizable RGB lights? Total bonus points for deskside ambience.One night, I was in the middle of a crucial raid, heart pounding, when my old mouse went kaput. My party was counting on me, and I was panicking. Thankfully, I had this Redragon mouse prepped and ready to go. I plugged it in, adjusted the DPI with a quick button press (lightning-fast responsiveness!), and BAM \u2013 back in the fight, dominating like never before. We cleared the raid, and my party hailed me as the hero with the clutch wireless mouse. True story.So, if you're tired of tangled wires and finicky mice, do yourself a favor and grab this Redragon. It's a wireless win in every way.",

                "reviewText": "Works well, feels good, no significant delay when in wireless mode. Need more tension on the middle mouse button scroll function (too easy to scroll if just bumped, when can put you into the position of changing weapons right at the worst time.) Also, too easy to push the rearmost programmable button on the left side; I've had to set that to some innocuous function rather than use to advantage.Overall, though, I'm very pleased at what I get for the price.",

If it starts flashing and the battery is low, just plug it up and keep right on working.The programmable buttons are great. With the work I do, copy and paste are used a lot. I have my keyboard as F2-Select All, F3-Copy, F4 Paste. I changed the raise and lower DPI buttons behind the wheel to copy and paste. Now and I do it without the keyboard. I moved the raise and lower DPI to beside my thumb behind the front button on the side which is Select All now. This mouse might now be for everyone, but it's worth checking out.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I was surprised with the quality of this mouse for its price. It feels comfortable to use for extended periods of time ( my hand is a medium to large size hand), has some heft to it , and doesn't seem as flimsy as other wireless mice. The layout of the buttons on the mouse are well placed overall with an exception to the front left mouse button that seems to be placed slightly too much forward . (although this may differ depending on your hand size). Battery life is good and gets me thru a days worth of use without having to recharge.The Red dragon software for this mouse feels well made, intuitive and has the awesome feature of creating macros and reassigning the extra buttons on the mouse. Aesthetically speaking the mouse looks sleek and gives you good control on the lighting pattern of the mouse that ranges from full on RGB mode to a cool breathing effect.The only bad thing about this mouse is the slot on the bottom of the mouse for storing the USB dongle. It felt a bit loose and is not flush with the bottom surface of the mouse making it susceptible to being lost. Perhaps in the next version this issue could be addressed.Overall, I'd say this mouse is a great choice for anybody looking for an inexpensive wireless mouse for their work or gaming setups. I give this mouse a 4.5/5 for its great features, ergonomics, and style.Pros:- Great Ergonomics ( Medium to large size hands)- Button layout- Program's ease of use- Battery Lasts multiple daysCons- The USB dongle slot on the mouse",
