It is easy to pair with the computer, and a full battery charge lasts longer than one full day. The wheel is very smooth-action, and the buttons are \"easy-push.\" I would buy this mouse again.",

                "reviewText": "We recently bought a wireless mouse for our daughter, who is currently in graduate school. She had been voicing her frustration about the trackpad on her Mac, expressing a strong preference for a mouse similar to the one she uses on her desktop setup at home. After conducting some research, I came across this particular mouse. Its design appeared sleek and aerodynamic, the price was appealing, and it boasted compatibility with Mac. At a mere $11.88, it seemed like a no-brainer.Upon receiving the mouse, I was taken aback by its featherlight weight. In comparison to my Razer Death Adder Pro wireless mouse, it felt exceptionally light, almost to the point of feeling delicate. The mouse offered two connectivity options: Bluetooth and 2.4G with a USB receiver.The Bluetooth pairing process was hassle-free, with no complaints there. However, an issue I observed with the Bluetooth connection was that the mouse movement on the screen felt somewhat jerky, lacking the smoothness I was accustomed to. While I can't be certain if this was due to my familiarity with the Razer mouse, the jerkiness was definitely noticeable and somewhat annoying.I then switched to the 2.4G connection, and it was a game-changer. The added convenience of the included USB to USB-C adapter was a nice touch. Kudos for that. After plugging in the adapter and switching to 2.4G, the mouse's performance felt exceptionally smooth, free from jitter, lag, or jerkiness.Considering the price, I believe it's a worthwhile purchase. I admire its aesthetic, reminiscent of Apple's design sensibilities, and the ambient light feature is a definite plus. Particularly when used with the 2.4G adapter, it provides excellent value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mouse when the original mouse for my iMac stopped working properly. My first impression was how light it was, which makes sense because it doesn\u2019t use batteries like my original mouse did. It can work with either bluetooth or wireless USB, so I first set it up for bluetooth use because I didn\u2019t want to dedicate a USB port for it. It took a little while, but I did eventually get it to pair with my computer. Unfortunately, I was not able to change the settings for the mouse while it was in bluetooth connection mode, and the cursor moved way too fast for my preference. So I changed it to a wireless USB connection after which I was able to adjust the cursor movement to my taste.I have been using it for about a week now, and I would say it works decently, but not quite as well as my original mouse. It doesn\u2019t have all the gestures that the Apple mouse has, where for example you can expand the view size by tapping, and you can scroll horizontally. But it does have a manual scroll wheel which is useful. It seems to go into \u201csleep\u201d mode if you don\u2019t use it for awhile in order to conserve the battery, and that means you have to click once to wake it up, which is slightly annoying. And I have noticed that the click isn\u2019t quite as discreet and satisfying on this mouse, meaning that sometimes if I click too softly it feels like I have clicked, but nothing happens. On the other mouse, the difference between a click and a non-click was always very clear.In summary, this mouse isn\u2019t as useful or high quality as my original mouse, but it is also much cheaper and it does get the job done. I\u2019ll probably end up using it with a laptop when traveling.",
