The rubber/plastic had worn down enough to cause major problems, but I'm pretty sure I used it for 10+ years.Beyond basic use, I use this mouse for gaming. I'm a casual but frequent gamer. If you're serious about your gaming, this may not be suitable re: response time or whatever, but I've never noticed anything. It has the perfect number and layout of buttons for FPS. Thumb buttons are out of the way when I don't need them, but easily accessible when I do.",

I ordered a new 510 and it was supposed to have a unifying dongle with it. Well it didn't, some one had cut the package open and left the mouse but took the dongle. Of course I told Amazon about it and they replaced it no questions asked in just 2 weeks, Kudos Amazon! Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I have fairly large hands and was looking for a simple mouse without a million buttons or lights or a rocket attached.The size and weight is perfect for my hands and I have had this plugged into my main desktop and have used it over a year (since March 2020 and this is written May 2021) for several hours every single day without a single issue.Tracking is super accurate, smooth. The buttons click still like day 1. The roller wheel has a very nice clicky yet smooth-ish action which is perfect for scrolling. The two side buttons I dont use much and wish I could get one without but they have stayed out of the way. The lettering is fading gently with use and thats the only indicator the mouse is over a year old - usage wise I don't notice any degradation. The original battery is still in use and I have never switched it off.Ergonomics wise I have had zero issues and I use it these days with a mousepad that has a gel wrist support as I needed one for a keyboard and this came with it but it tracks otherwise on any surface.There has been zero lag noticeable (i am not a gamer) and the movement across my 27inch high-res screen has been perfect for my needs.At \u00a325 its not cheap when you can get a bluetooth mouse for under \u00a315 (I have a review of a microsoft mouse that my kids use) but when you need something for long term use and want something that fits slightly large adult hands - this is a perfect device.",
