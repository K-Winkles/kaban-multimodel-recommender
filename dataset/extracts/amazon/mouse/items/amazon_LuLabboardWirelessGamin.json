                "reviewText": "It's hard to review something you hope you'll never have to use so, in this case, I guess this is more of a preview.To me the hammer seems a little light. I think it would take a pretty powerful whack with this to break through toughened, laminated glass but the pointed ends are probably designed to deliver a pin-point blow in an emergency. There's also a, razor-sharp, shrouded blade intended to cut through a seat belt for easy release. As with most super-sharp blades, I would probably only trust this for single use at maximum sharpness but, if that avoids catastrophe, then it's probably served it's purpose and value.The hammer is a bright semi-fluorescent reddish orange for easier location in the dark. It does come supplied with a mounting cradle but I'm not sure I'd want to drill holes inside my car to fit that. Besides. I found it quite tight fitting which might hamper quick release? I'd be more inclined just to store the hammer loose in the glove compartment, side pocket or center console.I think it's certainly worth the modest cost to give yourself an extra chance in a tricky situation though, for your sake, I hope you'd never have to use it.",
