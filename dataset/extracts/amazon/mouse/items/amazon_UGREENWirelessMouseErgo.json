                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Superb design, excellent Bluetooth functionality",
                "reviewText": "I've been using a Tecknet 2.4G/Bluetooth mouse that I bought in August 2022. Recently, that mouse has started to manifest accuracy errors and the mouse cursor frequently disappears from the screen when I haven't moved the mouse for a few minutes (during those periods where I'm just typing). Not earth-shattering problems but pretty annoying. I purchased this UGREEN mouse as a replacement with the hope that it would not have the tracking/clicking accuracy issues of the Tecknet mouse as well as not having the odd disappearing mouse cursor.First, the UGREEN mouse is a bit larger and more ergonomically sculpted than the Tecknet mouse (although it is specifically set up for right-handed folks while the Tecknet mouse is symmetric and so could be used by lefties taking in to account that the back/forward buttons are mounted for righties). I'm male with normal-sized hands and the more pronounced sculpting and taller arc shape of the UGREEN mouse makes it one of the most comfortable mouses I've used (and I've used piles of expensive Logi, Microsoft, and HP premium mouses along with other generic brands like the Tecknet mouse and this one). The side rubber isn't super grippy but the texture is enough to keep it from slipping (and the lack of stickiness will make it less prone to gathering dust and debris). This mouse is VERY quiet. I'm fine with the normal button clicky sound (which the Tecknet mouse made) but, if you're after library quiet mouse click buttons, this one delivers. What surprised me about the UGREEN mouse versus the Tecknet mouse was how it behaves via the Bluetooth connection. The Tecknet mouse absolutely required a button click to wake up both the mouse and then some subsequent jiggling to wake up the computer. This UGREEN mouse just requires that you jiggle it (like you would with a 2.4G wireless connection) to wake it and the computer up. I thought Bluetooth connected mouses go to sleep after a period of time and require an active button click to wake up then some subsequent jiggling to wake up the computer (that's how the Tecknet mouse worked). This is a very pleasant surprise (2.4G wireless wake up behavior, no wireless 2.4G USB receiver plug required). This mouse has 4 dpi modes and the switch for this is intelligently placed on the underside of the mouse (some mouses put the switch up top near the click wheel meaning that you can inadvertently change your desired tracking accuracy). Additionally, when you press the switch, a small, red LED will blink once, twice, thrice, or four times to let you know which tracking mode you're in (for me, mode #3, 2000 dpi, was just fine; mode #4, 4000 dpi moved the cursor a little too fast for regular computer work but might be of interest to gamers).I will say that setting up the initial Bluetooth connect to my computer was fairly clumsy and it took me several attempts before I got the mouse to appear in the list of available Bluetooth devices so that I could connect it (didn't really have that issue with the Tecknet mouse). But, once connected, it is solid and, given that this is a one-time connection, I'm not particularly concerned (but hang on to the instruction manual just in case you need to connect this mouse to another computer down the road). I haven't tried out the multiple device connection feature as yet but it's nice to know that it's there as I may purchase another of these mouses for my wife who uses both a Windows laptop and a Macbook Pro laptop (currently using two different - and very expensive - Logi mouses for each and neither of them performs any better than this UGREEN mouse).If the accuracy and wonderful Bluetooth behavior of this mouse holds up over time then this mouse will certainly deserve all five stars I've given it today.",

                "reviewText": "I have to admit, this mouse is lives up to its claim as being quiet. It's not totally silent, but is the quietest clicker I've ever used. It is replacing my previous mouse from Tecknet, which is supposedly \"silent\" also, after its left button became sporadic. The UGREEN mouse is quieter than the Tecknet, both the main buttons and especially the side buttons. I find it is also slightly more comfortable than the Tecknet. The only downside is that it is slightly \"stickier\" on the movement. Not terrible, but I have always preferred using a neoprene mousepad, and this mouses drags on the pad. It's not as bad when used directly on a desk surface, but still not as smooth of a slider as the Tecknet. But man, is it quiet. If that's important to you, this is the mouse to get.",
