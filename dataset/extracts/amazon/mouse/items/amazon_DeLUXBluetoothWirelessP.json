The mouse was out of stock, so I ordered the mouse, keyboard and case/stand combination instead. The accuracy is amazing and the lavender color is perfect. It matches my iPad mini, case and pencil perfectly! I also want to mention that the customer service is outstanding. I sent a question via Amazon to the seller and I received an answer in less than 24 hours. I have now replaced my work mouse and my travel mouse and keyboard. I will absolutely purchase from them again because I want a backup for my mouse, and in a beautiful shade of Purple!!",

Everything from the S-Pen Pro to a fold up key-board. This mouse is an AMAZING addition to it and highly recomended for all Z Fold owners! Its the only mouse that i found that can do a fold or slide motion just like the phone and keyboard. It comes fully charged so you can use it right away. Its small and light weight, and has a built in laser pointer. So now I can basically carry around a PC in my pants pockets. Its worth every penny and feels like it was built for this device.",

It works well, connects quickly and folds up to a compact size for travel BUT ...I discovered that the issues I was having with headphone and a controller connectivity with my Steam Deck all went away when I stopped using this mouse.I tested with at least three other mice and still had no problems. Reconnected this one and all the problems were back. So as much as I liked this mouse by itself I could only give it 2 stars for the connection issues it caused.",
