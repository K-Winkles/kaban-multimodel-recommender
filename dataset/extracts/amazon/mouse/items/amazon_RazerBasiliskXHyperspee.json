A\u00ed eles podem abrir ou fazer um rasgo na embalagem (pq eles t\u00eam c\u00e3es que conseguem farejar esse tipo de coisa), mas nada que danifique o produto. \u00c9 apenas o pessoal da alf\u00e2ndega trabalhando para a seguran\u00e7a de todos, isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 culpa do vendedor!",

                "reviewText": "This was the first Razer product I\u2019ve bought, but have got a second one as a gift for someone based on how good it is.It\u2019s very light and comfortable, works flawlessly on the desk surface with no noticeable lag. Can work on Bluetooth or using the supplied 2.4GHz WiFi dongle which is cleverly stored inside the device.The supplied single AA battery has lasted for 2 years of fairly infrequent use (using Bluetooth rather than WiFi), which is amazing- and I have never turned the mouse off- it goes to sleep by itself. All buttons are programmable; there are the normal left and right, the scroll wheel, a button behind it which by default changes the sensitivity, and 2 extra ones next to your thumb (you can program macros for them in the supplied software - ours are copy/paste)Only 2 points to be aware of- 1) it is definitively a right handed form factor. Not very friendly for lefties I\u2019m afraid, but if you can use your right hand for the mouse, it is very comfortable.2) No RGB lights. Some people want everything lit up, but personally, I\u2019d rather have a long battery life and no cord.",

I keep the USB-A dongle in my Windows laptop and connect the mouse through Bluetooth with my MacBook Pro, which lacks a USB-A port. Even when I have both computers turned on, I can use the switch on the bottom of the mouse to easily select either the Windows or MacOS laptop.The mouse also has a button enabling the user to select the sensitivity. This is really handy when using a very large screen, because different tasks might require a different sensitivity to move across the screen.",
