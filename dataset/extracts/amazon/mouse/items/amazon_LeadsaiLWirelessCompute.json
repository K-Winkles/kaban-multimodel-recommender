When I click to drag something, the back button always gets clicked as well, It makes accidental data loss a very real thing, by my own hand yet. Thats what happened. The mouse \"almost\", met its untimely end. But wrote this review instead. But it is a good mouse and works very well. My hand is just annoyingly large and fingers are too fat. If some1 has tiny hands then this is the mouse of ur dreams. Get three, its worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the 'Classic Grey' LeadsaiL LX-002 model:At 4.1\" inches in length, this mouse feels pretty comfortable in my normal size man hand, although I do wish it was slightly longer (I've found 4.5 to 4.9\" to be the most comfortable length for my hands). The left and right click buttons are quiet as advertised, but the two side buttons are a bit louder than the 8 other mouses I've used so far. The scroll wheel is sturdy, it has teeth to it, and it's easy to click on without accidentally clicking one of the top buttons too. The smooth gloss top finish also makes it easier to clean compared to the soft touch matte finishes prevalent on other mouses.Unfortunately, the unit I received has what I am assuming is an annoying defect that I have not experienced in any other mouse. That is, when the battery is low, the cursor will start moving/jittering by itself uncontrollably which is very frustrating because it's basically completely unusuable in that state and happens suddenly. Other mouses I've used will simply have an LED that starts flashing as an indicator that you'll need to recharge it once you're done for the day.If you're lucky enough to get one of these without any issues then there's a good chance you'll be satisfied with it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this mouse for about 3.5 years now, and I seldom use it. Every time I do use it, I remember why it hides in the bottom of my computer drawer most of the time. Its never worked correctly on any of my computers -- it jumps around when trying to make precise clicks and it frequently messes up my mouse clicks for gaming. Its very frustrating.Not everything is bad -- it has a lot of functions built into the buttons and the scroll wheel is smooth and fast. Finally, the price is right -- but you get what you pay for.I'm ordering a Logitech for my next mouse and then I'm going to toss this one so it never ends up in the bottom of my drawer again.",
