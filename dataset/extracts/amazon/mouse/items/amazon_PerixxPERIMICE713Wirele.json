Been using it for a week and so far so good. Better quality than some others out there. Really sturdy, and looks cool. I got a wired as I didn't want to mess around with batteries all the time. So no delays and quite responsive. I haven't used any of the extra side buttons yet. So sure what I could use them for, to be frank",

Only negative is that for me to use it with Macbook Air it does require batteries, not rechargeable. But it is Bluetooth and wifi connectable. I love it!",

                "reviewText": "Update 2022-04-09:This mouse has caused immense pain in my thumb and wrist. I have dropped the rating to 1 star (previously was 3 stars). I stopped using it and went back to a \"regular\" mouse and my wrist and thumb pain went away almost completely in less than 3 days. However, now my previous pain is coming back from using the regular mouse.Original review:This mouse is too close to vertical to really be comfortable. I think it needs to be closer 45 degrees to really alleviate the pain completely. I've been using this thing for a few weeks now, and the pain that I was feeling before has subsided, but now I have pain in a different area above my index finger. This is because the angle is too steep and it causes me to strain a different muscle in my arm.It's taking a long time to get used to this vertical layout, which makes it much more difficult to be precise with movements. The mouse overall is quite tall, and I find myself bumping it very often when moving my hand from the keyboard to try to put it on to the mouse.The DPI button is nice to have, but is in a very awkward spot and is hard to hit. I'm not able to make changes on the fly like I was expecting and like my old mouse was able to do, because the button is too awkward to press. Also the DPI change is not substantial enough to really even be worth doing it.Lastly, there's a very strange issue ever since I plugged in this mouse. Periodically the mouse cursor will jump all the way across the screen to some random position. I Frequently have to reposition the mouse back to where I needed it to be. This is very frustrating especially when working with images, because when I click to draw something the mouse cursor is not where I expected it to be. I've never seen this happen with any other mouse that I've used, and it started immediately after I started using this mouse.For the most part this thing works as advertised (minus the weird jumping around issue), and it did alleviate the pain I was having before, but it's really not a solution to wrist pain in general. The main buttons work, the scroll wheel works, the back and forward buttons work, and the DPI buttons work. Build quality seems fine. I like that there's no battery to have to worry about, but overall I'm not really satisfied with this purchase. I'm not sure yet if I'll return it, or just cycle it back and forth with my other regular mouse.",
