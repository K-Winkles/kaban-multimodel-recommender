I have not had any issues with connectivity and it has been paired with my laptop for at least a year or two now. I charged it when I first got it, but haven\u2019t needed to since so it holds the charge well! I don\u2019t use it all day every day though, so that may likely affect how often one needs to charge it. However, the cord they sent for both ends well and works well!I also LOVE the green color and am very happy with the \u201cclick\u201d noise as it is store quiet.",
