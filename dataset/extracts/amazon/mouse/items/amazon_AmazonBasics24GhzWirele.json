It's like the Robin Hood of computer peripherals, taking from the overpriced brands and giving you a steal of a deal. Thank you, Amazon Basics, for rescuing our wallets from the tyranny of exorbitant mouse prices!Now, let's talk functionality.

                "reviewText": "Pre Script: I've updated this review below and changed the rating from 3 to 5. ~Dan.I can see where this is probably just fine for many people. But, I was noticing something distracting when I was trying to split the curser between characters when I was editing a document I was working on. You know how it is when you want to insert a word or a space or something, right? I'd move the mouse for what seemed to me an appropriate amount, but nothing would happen with the curser. Then I'd move a bit more and more and then finally it would jump past the point I wanted it to be at. So, I'm fighting this thing going back and forth trying to get in between characters and it's just frustrating.So, I suppose the point here is that the fine resolution just isn't good enough for me. Trying to draw numbers in Paint, it was hurky-jurky and made really ugly lines. And then the draw click somehow locked in the software and it wouldn't stop drawing after I released the left-click. I'm shopping again for a better mouse. Looking to keep this in the drawer for an emergency backup.UPDATE - Mar 28, 2022Okay. I was wrong. It wasn't the mouse. Rather, there's an obscure Windows setting that fixed this. (See below paragraph.) I quickly realized this when I purchased a new Logitech 510 mouse (which I love! ($19.95 on Amazon)), but it was suffering from the exact same chunky resolution problem! I knew that wasn't right. Did some more digging and found out that there's a setting for that. I'm happily writing this using the Amazon basics mouse that is the object of this review. It's just fine. But, let me say. . . the five stars I've updated this review to from the original 3 stars in no way suggests that this mouse is somehow equal to the Logitech 510 mouse. (Yes, I'm going to go back to the Logitech after this. :) When comparing products using the star ratings, use your brain. A Ford can be worthy of 5 stars. But, a Ford is not a Tesla, which may also be sporting 5 stars. They are NOT equal.Now, if you are having this same problem (Windows 10) that I previously described, do this: Open 'Settings'. Click on 'Devices'. Click on 'Mouse'. Click on hypertext on the right hand side which reads 'Additional mouse options'. (A 'Mouse Properties' window opens.) Click on the 'Pointer Options' tab. In the 'Motion' box, click on the check box next to 'Enhance pointer precision'. Click 'OK'. (It might take a few seconds for it to believe that's what you want.) All should be good now. (You're welcome!)",

                "reviewText": "I have a medium to large size female hand and find this mouse smaller than the previous average size ones I've had. This leaves a small void between my palm and the mouse, which can cause a little stiffness/pain if using for an extended period. The mouse was super simple to get up and running - insert 2 AA batteries, make sure the button is turned on and it registered immediately and started working. Good responsiveness and quiet clicking and scrolling. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks so far, so I can't speak to its longevity or how long the batteries last - I'll be curious to see. If I encounter any problems, I will come back and update.",
