                "reviewText": "This is a review of the \u201cModel D Wireless\u201d gaming mouse from Glorious. This review will be split into 6 parts: SHAPE (how comfortable the mouse\u2019s shape is to hold), BUILD QUALITY (how strong the mouse is built), QUALITY-CONTROL (the margin of error between copies of the mouse), CLICKS (how good the buttons feel to press), GLIDE (how fast the mouse can move on your mousepad), and finally WEIGHT (how much the mouse weighs)Starting off we have shape; the shape of the Model D is a large ergonomic shape with side buttons only on the left side. For this reason, this mouse is meant for people who have medium \u2013 large hand sizes and are right-handed. If you are left-handed, I strongly recommend not getting this mouse. If you are right-handed, however the mouse shape feels amazing for palm and claw grip. For me I use a claw grip and this mouse is awesome!Next up the build quality and quality control; the build quality of this mouse is mostly good besides for a little side-play on the clicks and some side button wobble. The mouse does last a while (I\u2019ve been using it for 1 year at the time of making this review) and I haven\u2019t had any big build quality issues. The quality control of Glorious mice has always been lousy according to popular mouse reviewers, but after looking around, asking people and watching other reviews, I think the quality control of the mouse is pretty good.Now to review clicks, glide and weight. The Glorious Model D\u2019s clicks are on the heavier side but they are still easy to repeatedly click. The Model D uses an Omron\u00ae\ufe0f Mechanical Switches Rated For 20 Million Clicks. The glide is *okay* its not super-fast but it\u2019s not too slow either. If you are a fan of faster mouse feet I think you would be better off buying \u201cafter market\u201d mouse feet. The Model D\u2019s weight is 70 grams and is pretty light but recently, mice have been getting below 50 grams easily. The weight is still good though!Onto the final question, \u201cWould I recommend this mouse?\u201d and the answer is surprisingly \u201cno.\u201d However, it\u2019s not because the mouse is bad, in fact the mouse is great, but I would not recommend it because Glorious has made a new mouse called the \u201cModel D 2 pro\u201d which is a lighter version of the model D. If you\u2019re thinking about getting a new Glorious mouse I\u2019d just say get the Model D 2 pro.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: Fantastic mouse for the money. Good RGB, Program could be better, great feel, good battery life.-If you can\u2019t afford or just can\u2019t bring yourself to justify a $150 mouse like a superlight or viper ultimate id highly recommend the Model O wireless.Pros:-Good color and quality-Battery life-USB-C charging-Comfortable feel-Great buttons-Good RGB-Good Program for customizationCons:-It\u2019s a con and a Note IMPORTANT!!!! DO NOT USE THE \u201cMODEL O\u201d PROGRAM!!! For whatever reason it doesn\u2019t work 90% of the time and it\u2019s a well-known issue HOWEVER USE THE \u201cGlorious Core\u201d program off their website and this mouse works just fine!-I hate to say it but there\u2019s really no cons to the mouse, if there is it\u2019s a personal and opinion based one, objectively there\u2019s nothing wrong with the mouse.The Long:For better understanding of my review id like to preface that I\u2019m a full-time video editor and I do play games heavily too. I\u2019m also not the richest person so when I buy something I\u2019m looking for what makes sense for the money and value. I searched for months for reviews between the top three mice in the game and industry and those are the Logitech Superlight, the Razor ultimate and this the model O. Now when I saw the price tags at the time respectively $150~, $120-100, $80~ I just couldn\u2019t financially bring myself to spend over $100 BEFORE tax and shipping on a mouse I just couldn\u2019t justify it. I spent $98 total for this mouse and online all the reviews put it in the same class with the \u201cbest gamming mouse ever made\u201d the superlight. And I mean from my analysis its literally the competitor like if you compared a GT mustang to a Challenger and Charger classed cars respectively it would come to user preference. Any complaints on this mouse were nit picky at best about, 3-5 grams of weight (something I highly doubt a regular person would ever notice) or the specific \u201cthings\u201d it comes with. I mean the superlight gets hated on for not having USB-C. So, here\u2019s my honest opinion from what I can deduce.-----If you have the money and simply just want the best thing to say you have it, then buy a super light, if you want that but in Razer for some reason for their awful program that takes over you computer? Then buy the ultimate. BUT! If you\u2019re a \u201cnormal\u201d person who can\u2019t justify spending over $100 on a mouse, then this is the bets you\u2019ll ever do. The fact that its sub 100 and is in the same class ass the other two means something! I daily this thing and I went from an old cool master to a razor viper to this and I fell in love. For refence I have big meaty hands and the only downside is that for right-handed people the right side where your pinky rests is thinner then a viper so it took some time for me to get used to a \u201chour glass shaped\u201d mouse. For $80 at the time, you get beautiful RGB, I do like it I mostly keep my turned off because it saves a bit of battery life as I use mine all day every day, the color of the mouse is a nice \u201cmatt\u201d white, so it has this premium look to it like the color and texture they choose is beautiful. The clicks and center wheel are fantastic. As far as I can tell its light weight. I don\u2019t personally notice the honeycomb so that\u2019s a personal preference miles may vary. It comes with the charging cable that\u2019s long enough to act as the mouse cable if you need to charge while you play and it\u2019s a braided line so its almost like its not there HOWEVER you wont even use it long! Because this is USB-C it charges in a matter of minutes. I\u2019m not joking, if my mouse gets to 30% ish ill plug it in and no lie walk away to get water come back it\u2019ll be at 50% ill maybe google something watch one video or que for a match and it\u2019ll be at 100% like its insane and as to why Logitech doesn\u2019t use USB-C I can\u2019t for the life of me understand its so useful. The Dongle it comes with is good quality and I usually leave it plugged in on my desk so when I need to charge ill just unplug the dongle and plug the remote in and done. The program is what sold this for me. Now, throw back to my previous note the \u201cmodel o\u201d standalone program just dose not work. No one knows why and it\u2019s been an issue for years, the \u201cglorious core\u201d program works perfectly fine and recognizes the mouse with no issues and has plenty of customization. Some specifics, you can move your DPI sliders you get 5 I believe, and they can be color coded to what ever colors you like I usually set my blue to 2000 DPI and just keep it there but you can set them where you like and depending on what your doing you can adjust the DPI on the mouse and the color under the mouse will indicate which DPI setting its on. You can adjust the color brightness in increments which is insane to me I\u2019ve never seen RGB where the brightness is a slider!! And the best part you can separate the RGB from the mouse \u201cplugged in\u201d or not, let me explain. If the mouse is plugged in you can tell the program what percentage of RGB brightness you\u2019d like it to be and if its unplugged what you\u2019d like it to be for example when my mouse is un plugged I have it set to 0% (again I run mine all day so I like to keep the RGB off ) but, I have it set to 60% when plugged in so while its off when I\u2019m using it the second I plug the mouse in to charge the RGB kicks on. I just think its super cool, you can set it for battery life to if the battery gets to low you can have it adjust the RGB. As for battery life it works for days without charging. I haven\u2019t killed it yet but I also frequently forget to turn it off, the mouse does have a setting for sleep mode so if you don\u2019t use it for a while it \u201csleeps\u201d itself saving your battery life this is annoying if your in game and don\u2019t move for a while you have to jiggle the mouse to get it to turn back on BUT this setting can be adjusted or turned off so no worries! Again, with me frequently forgetting to turn it off ill only have to charge it maybe every 3 days at the worst. The longest I\u2019ve gone is 5 days no charge. Again, that\u2019s someone using it all day every day and then when I need to charge it I usually find a coinvent spot like if I need to go to the bathroom or make food that\u2019s when ill charge it and its always done when I come back it\u2019s like charging isn\u2019t even an issue that I\u2019ve ever noticed, I\u2019ve never been annoyed by it.",
