Its design and shape are perfect for long-term immersive binge gaming....its solid, and exceptional sensitivity make it an all around great piece of hardware especially for the price!!!UPDATE~Going on to a year of use and no BS this mouse is awesome. When I first got it I wasn't too keen on the multiple buttons until I started playing games with customizable configurations and I swear by this thing! I saw bunches of good reviews and bunches of bad ones. I simply tell it like it is. It's a GREAT wireless and battery-powered gaming mouse. I've replaced the batteries once so far and that's that. My only real complaint is it's kind of big, that's probably a good thing as having all the auxiliary buttons spread out a bit helps prevent accidental button presses. It's not crazy huge or anything, my hands are a little smaller for a guy and the mouse is just fine. Absolutely a bargain and a deal for the price, I DEFINITELY recommend THIS ONE! lol no bs Happy Gaming everyone reading this!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this mouse for a few months and it has worked great so far. The adjustable DPI has made it great for a variety of different gaming and for everyday use. This mouse is a bit heavier due to the use of 2 AA batteries which I prefer over the rechargeable mice I have used in the past. It also fits my hand comfortably with a nice arch giving me the feel I prefer for gaming. I do recommend this mouse and for the lower price compared to others with the same stats you can't go wrong.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a hell of a deal for a mouse. Looks great, feels good in the hand, and everything works well. I dislike the thumb fire button, but the company is very open to customer feedback and have been receptive to suggestions. I can see how in certain gaming the thumb fire button is actually handy, however it may not be for everyone. At this price point though it is hard to really complain as nothing else comes close to the this mouse. If you can adjust its a fantastic mouse though.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My nice razer mouse broke and I bought this as a temporary replacement for the next 2-3 weeks.For 15$ I have used worse mice and to its credit some things about this I do like.Pros2xAA batteries The battery life is probably amazingFeels solid and well built, no idea if either is true but gives the illusion of good build qualityHas 3 side buttons and 2 dpi up and down buttonsConsSilent this mouse is not. Kinda of a dead giveaway of cheaper quality.No bluetooth, Not a big deal for me but I've seen plenty of mice in this price range with it.Heavy. Two AA batteries makes most of the weight come from the back of the mouse which while not terrible isn't helped by the fact the batteries are not centered throwing the whole feel off.The scroll wheel is very recessed relative to the mouse buttons and is hard and uncomfortable to scroll.The 2 side button are recessed into the side and the only way to click them is to press where the top and side plastic join. One of the side buttons has plastic bumps, presumably so its easier to differentiate but just makes hitting the back button feel unnatural as it's hard to tell it from the surrounding plastic.Because of the large battery bay the mouse optical sensor is not centered and is shoved off to the left. Normal use I had no issues but at certain angles I can feel either slower or/or imprecise movement.Tl:Dr this is not the worst 15$ I've ever spent but unless you really need the extra buttons just go buy a Logitech or something for the same price.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who generally has to buy stuff like mice and key boards on a tight budget I can definitely say that this mouse is one of the best quality budget mice that I have bought. the mouse has a comfortable grip, feels really solid, and is nice and heavy. when playing games the mice feels super responsive and has no problem with make small and precise adjustments when aiming. As I have mention earlier this mice is a little heavy so If your looking a light weight mouse then this probably isn't what your looking for but If you prefer heavier mice like I do then this is a really good option for you",

                "reviewText": "I've used Tecknet mice for years, probably close to a decade total. I consider it a cheap, but good quality brand. Usually they last for years, and then the scroll wheel breaks and I go check out their current products for a replacement.This mouse, on the other hand, lasted just over a month. The return window ended a week ago. The scroll wheel still mostly works, but clicking... not so much.Also... the picture looks nice and ergonomic, like other Tecknet mice I've had in the past. But the back and forward buttons are much too far back, so every time I try to reposition the mouse I accidentally click back. Trying to hold it differently so that doesn't happen actually makes my hand cramp after a while. This is the brand that used to make my favorite ergonomic wireless mouse. But this particular mouse, on the other hand... I think I actually hate it.",
