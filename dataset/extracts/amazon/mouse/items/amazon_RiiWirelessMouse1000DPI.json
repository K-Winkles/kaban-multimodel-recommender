It has been packed in tight spaces, tossed, dropped etc. I love that it uses 2 AAA batteries. In the 2 years that I\u2019ve had this mouse I\u2019ve only ever changed the batteries on this thing TWICE!!!!! The only times I will turn my mouse off is when I am packing it up for travel. I\u2019m finally buying the same mouse because it randomly stopped functioning for me ): (pretty sure it was my glass of water that spilled everywhere yesterday that may have done it.)I\u2019ve looked through Amazon for at least 2 hours just now trying to find a \u201cbetter\u201d mouse but none compare. ESPECIALLY for the price!!So if you\u2019re weary of buying a cheap, but cute, pink mouse. Definitely go for it! (Also this is the same seller I bought my mouse from 2 years ago)",

But, it's a mouse. I don't care about all that. It goes click good and I can use it on my PC. Scroll wheel works fine - is also a button. It is missing 2 extra buttons that will go forward or back on a page....but, I always accidentally click these buttons so the fact they are NOT PRESENT on the mouse is another plus. Also the sleep mode means I don't have to worry about clicking off my mouse or else my batter is dead. Also, the sleep mode isn't so fast where you find yourself having to wake up the mouse all the time. THE PERFECT SLEEP TIMER. A+ mouse. The boys in China over at the \"Rii\" factory are churning out a winner. I recommend this mouse.",

Mouse itself is very lightweight and made of plastic. Uses 2 AA batteries not included with mouse. Haven\u2019t experienced any lagging. Mouse turns off automatically on standby and clicking the mouse wakes it up so not draining batteries when not in use which is a plus. Only downside is I\u2019ve had it for give or take 2 weeks now and with minimal use the left clicker has already gotten stuck maybe 2 times. Also, the battery compartment door is not so easy to open and close. I can tell it won\u2019t last long but it\u2019s getting the job done so far and cost only 5 bucks so .. you get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this mouse for gaming, and overall, I think it's a decent deal considering the price point. However, there are a few aspects that caught me off guard.First off, let's talk about the functionality. The mouse does what it's supposed to do \u2013 it's responsive and works well for basic tasks. I appreciate that, especially given the affordable price. However, I wish the product description had clearly stated that the mouse requires two AA batteries to function. When I initially tried to use it and it didn't work, I was quite frustrated. It was only after some investigation that I realized the issue was with the batteries. So, if you're considering buying this mouse, keep in mind that you'll need to have two AA batteries on hand.Another point worth mentioning is the design. The mouse itself has a simple and functional design, but I did run into a challenge when trying to insert the batteries. The back panel is extremely difficult to open; in fact, I had to resort to using a knife to pry it open. This is something that could definitely be improved upon, as it's not the most user-friendly experience.Considering the price, I don't want to be overly critical. At the end of the day, it's a $5 mouse, and it does its job reasonably well. Yes, there are some inconveniences like the battery requirement and the challenging back panel, but these are somewhat expected at this price range. It's a basic mouse that gets the job done, just be prepared for a couple of minor hurdles. If you're looking for an affordable option and are willing to overlook these small issues, then this mouse might suit your needs.It's not without its quirks, but if you're on a tight budget and just need a functional mouse, it's a viable choice. Just remember to have some AA batteries handy and be patient with the back panel as it can break easily.",

The Logitech had no such problems.3) The on/off switch looked and felt like a micro\u2013DIP switch - the kind you have to scrape on/off with a paperclip.4) As with the Logitech, the mouse turns itself off after sitting for a few minutes. Unlike the Logi, however, you must scrape the on/off switch off, then back to on to use it again. The Logi wakes up by simply moving it.5) The mouse uses a red LED sensor that's bright enough to light up a basketball size spot on my wall from 3 feet away. The Logi users an infrared laser sensor that's invisible.6) The mouse takes two AAA batteries to power it's bright red LED whereas the Logitech takes a single AA battery.Pros:1) It's cheap.Conclusion: Spend the extra $4 to get the Logitech.",
