                "reviewText": "I needed a mouse for my laptop while on a long work assignment so I really just wanted something cheap to get me through. As long as it worked, my requirements were met. But I admit that I bought this because of its dual mode Bluetooth/USB wireless functionality. That means it should theoretically work with pretty much any other device I own.It is a little bit bigger than I expected - it's pretty flat, but it's also fairly long. As the box advertises that it's for a \"mobile office\", I was expecting more of a travel mouse size. But it's ok. It's light, at least, which makes me think it's mostly hollow and could have been smaller, but whatever. Just realize that it's kind of in between the size of a normal mouse and a travel mouse, which might be perfect for some people.It feels pretty good but it is covered in that matte finish that shows fingerprints really easily and I'll bet will wear off pretty quickly. I've only had it for a week or so and already the finger areas on mine are shiny. We'll see how it holds up.Functionally it works as well as any other wireless mouse I've owned. (I actually own several already, just forgot to bring any of them with me when I bought this - which has obviously happened before!) It's quite reliable in 2.4ghz wireless (USB dongle) mode. Bluetooth is spottier, but that's been my experience with literally every Bluetooth mouse. I'd never buy a straight Bluetooth mouse again; I just considered Bluetooth a bonus in this one in case I need it. I did try this mouse in Bluetooth mode and it mostly works fine, but a couple of times I'd wake up my computer and the mouse pointer would be slow or laggy or wouldn't reconnect or whatever. That's just Bluetooth for ya; it's not unique to this mouse or mice in general. I switched to 2.4ghz mode and that fixed all the problems.Battery life seems ok. I have had it die but it is rechargeable and you can use it while it's charging (as a wired mouse). But it seems to last a reasonable amount of time; I can't say how many hours but I've used it for several days of fairly heavy use (maybe 8-10 hours of computer use per day, with however much mouse use comes with that) before it starts dying. That's enough for me for a travel mouse, then I just plug it in for a few hours. The battery must be tiny in this thing but it works well enough. I will say that the AAA-powered 2.4Ghz mice I've had/still have will often go for months before needing new batteries, but then if your mouse does die and you have no more batteries around, you're stuck. I've had it happen. So it's a tradeoff. If you want the best of both worlds, you could get a mouse like that and just use rechargeable AAA's in it. (But then you need to have your charger with you too, so it's an extra thing to remember and carry.)Overall I'm happy enough with this purchase. It's not like it costs much and it's getting the job done for me.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was wanting to order a Bluetooth mouse for my iPad Pro 11 that would not break the bank as I am a broke adult. I found this mouse, read the reviews and watched the videos before buying. I was sold so I decided to order this mouse. It came in one day and looks exactly like the pictures and is wonderful! I got it yesterday so I only have been using it for a couple of hours now. I work nights, so I only plan on using this mouse at night when I am at work doing my journaling, planner, etc. Nothing major. I do have a gaming laptop that I use for other needs. One weird thing to me is, the scroll ring is odd to me lol. My mouse I use for my laptop is programmed differently. For this mouse, when you roll the ring thing up, it moves the page down and rolling it down, makes the page go up. My laptop mouse doesn\u2019t do that so I wasn\u2019t used to this haha.I haven\u2019t checked out the sleep mode or whatever else the mouse features are as whenever I am not using my mouse, I make sure to shut it off. I do notice when I am typing and not using the mouse, the colourful lights stop and it just glows a dim red colour. It comes back on when you move it though. It is quiet when clicking and the texture of the mouse is very smooth like velvet ooo! Lol. You can use the mouse to lock, open, scroll, close apps, etc. Came fully charged too. When I plugged it in to charge it, it glowed green so assuming it\u2019s fully charged haha. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fOh, for those who plan on getting this for their iPads too, if you are like me and use your iPad horizontal 100% of the time, if you have an app that forces your iPad vertically, make sure to turn off the rotation lock for you device because the mouse will think you are still using your iPad in the horizontal layout. It then will work just fine. No need to back out of the app at all. For $5.98 + tax, this is a great buy! I recommend! I think that is about it? Anyways check out the video and picture!! Hope this helps!",
