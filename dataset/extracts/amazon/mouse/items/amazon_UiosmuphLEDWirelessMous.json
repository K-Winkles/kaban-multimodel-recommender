                "reviewText": "DISLIKES: NONE!LIKES: Has an off and on button with 2 ON modes, the middle position is just the mouse, the other on position turns on a beautiful slow fading rainbow light show along the sides of the mouse as well as a small view port on top that changes colors as the sides fade into each color. It's nice to be able to turn off the color changing mode, as that does eat a bit more power to have that function on. I use that function when I feel like I need a change, then turn it off when I'm getting down to serious work. The mouse is wireless, came with everything needed to have it up and running once fully charged, this can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours depending on how much use is put on the rechargeable battery within it. Comes with it's own charging cable, and yes, it can be used while charging, it may take a little longer to get to a full charge if in use while charging, but at least you CAN still use it while charging, although I'd recommend buying a longer USB cable if you need to use it while in charge mode. But it seems to hold up for a very long time before needing a recharge, again, this depends on how much usage it gets. You'll know when it's time to recharge it, as it will become erratic and slow to respond when the battery has gotten too weak to keep the pointer moving smoothly across your screen and button presses slow or not responding.It self-installs, and that only took less than a minute on my old antiquated desktop system I'm using for creating my Christmas and Halloween Animated Lights to Music displays, as well as games I play on it and other things I use the system for.The mouse is comfortable in the hand, the soft touch buttons and scroll wheel are fantastic, no annoying clicking of the buttons when pressed or buzzing type sounds when using the scroll wheel, unlike other mouse types I've used in the past. This mouse is a joy to use and am very happy with it and how it functions. Well worth the small investment I paid for it.Yes, I'd highly recommend this mouse for anyone, especially for late night computerists where the clicking and scroll wheel buzzing type sounds of other mice could annoy someone watching TV or sleeping, if the computer happens to be in your bedroom. The silence of this mouse is definitely golden!I'd double the Star rating on this one to 10-Stars if that were possible. Best mouse I've ever purchased!",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical at first to get the quiet mouse because I tend to like the click noise of the mouse (when I'm the one gaming lol) but the sound and feel of the click on this mouse is SO satisfying! I definitely won't be switching back to my normal loud mouse. It moves really smoothly and feels nice in my hand. The only downside is that I wish the scroll wheel was just the tiniest bit easier to scroll as I find myself accidentally clicking down on it just trying to scroll which then wildly scrolls the page. Not the biggest deal, maybe I'm just heavy-handed.The LED feature is really cool though I don't find myself ever using it. I have no clue what the button under the scroll wheel does, it doesn't seem to do anything but maybe it's just programmable.I didn't need anything super fancy so this is perfect, I'm really happy with my purchase.Edit: after using this mouse for a few weeks, I do have just one small complaint. On the bottom of the mouse is the power switch and there are three positions that it can be in: On with LED on, On without LED, and Off, in that order. My only complaint is that the On without LED option is in the middle. I rarely use the LED because I'm afraid it will drain the battery and I just don't need it, so it would be much more convenient if the On with LED was in the middle position instead so you could just switch it easily On/Off.I bring my mouse to work every day and the other day I accidentally switched it to On with LED instead of off and put it in my bag. When I got home a few hours later it was completely dead and I had to recharge it.",
