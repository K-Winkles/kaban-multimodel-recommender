                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Basic mouse that works - - for now.",
                "reviewText": "I ordered this mouse (in blue) to replace the recently deceased exact same model that I've used for the past 2 or 3 years. I like the simplicity of the M185 mouse and mostly the best bang for your buck! I caught this one on sale for less than a ten-spot, so I thought, \"why not.\" I'm hoping that this one will last a bit longer than my two previous M185 models, that averaged about 3 years each. This model seems plagued by a short life span and is predisposed to mysteriously and suddenly dying, without any obvious symptoms or warning of any kind - - you're working and clicking along, going about your day, when suddenly the cursor on the computer screen freezes and that's it. Nothing, zero, nada. Funny thing, I'm very careful not to abuse or drop the mouse, and keep a fresh battery installed and watch for leakage and all that stuff - - they just stop working, and I assume it is caused by some sort of inherent electronic fault in the circuitry of the previous M185's. Due to my loyalty to the brand and model (and since it was on sale) I decided to give it one more shot. They say that \"third time's a charm\". I like the fact that the M185 is simple and uncluttered with extra buttons that I would never use for my purpose, which is simple web-browsing and the occasional text document production. The feel is solid, not heavy, but not cheap feeling, either. I'm used to the shape of this mouse, which to me is quite comfortable for long sessions, another reason why I kind of wanted to stay with this model. The buttons have an audible \"click\", which doesn't bother me at all, and the wheel moves smoothly and also has a clicking operation (which I rarely ever use). The overall surface of the mouse has a matte finish, but like my previous models I'm sure it will eventually wear shiny spots where my fingers reside and will attain a more \"well-used\" look in time. Connecting it was a breeze, too. I just plugged the dongle into a spare rear usb port of my desktop, and the mouse connected instantly, no problem. The dongle can be stored safely inside the battery compartment, so you can take the whole thing out of the house if needed for use elsewhere. The speed of 1000 dpi seems just right for my purposes. The one I ordered even came with its own AA Duracell battery, which I wasn't really expecting. This mouse also enters \"sleep mode\" when you don't use it for a while, and I can't say how many times I've got up and left it on all night. And that's not hard to do, as I'll explain next. The only real negative to this mouse is the absence of any easily visible status indicator of it's on / off switch. The rear housing of this mouse is matte black, including the tiny switch where you turn it on and off with your fingernail, with only a very faint \"on\" lettering (also black), and very hard to see with my aging eyes. The laser is not lighted or visible when on, also adding to the confusion, especially in a darkened room. So, as a workaround, I took a tiny drop of green paint and placed it down inside the switch slider to visibly help indicate the \"on\" position, and likewise a dot of bright orange for the \"off\" position. Many of Logitech's more expensive models (and a few other manufacturers) include this color-coded switch indication. I guess for the $$, they had to cut corners somewhere - - a minor complaint. In summary, this is a good basic mouse that works - - let's hope that this one will last longer than its two predecessors.",

En cuesti\u00f3n de ruido al hacer clics, pues es lo normal. El transmisor que se conecta a la computadora es s\u00faper peque\u00f1o y c\u00f3modo, y se enlaz\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticamente desde que lo conect\u00e9. Algo que me preocup\u00f3 fue no ver el t\u00edpico l\u00e1ser rojo que la mayor\u00eda de los mouses tiene, pero estuve investigando y completamente normal en este, porque maneja lo que es el l\u00e1ser invisible.",
