The ones I found were expensive. Then I stumbled across this one. I really doubted it work but for the price thought I'd give it a try. Well much to my surprise it worked and it worked well!!!! It was easy to install, too! I've had it for a week now and am very happy with it.",

Making you think at first it isn't on. The DPI options are well chosen. It is too small for average hands. Needs to be a third larger which I did know prior to ordering. It would be ergonomic if it were larger.It feels and seems cheap, like you expect of a $6-7 mouse. Cord is thin and stays coiled up rather than feeding out nicely when you take it out. I was on the fence about sending it back. Some cheap gaming mice for the same money are better, but some don't seem to scroll as well in MacOS as they do in Windows. Wish there were more USB C mice to choose from.In the end since it moves and scrolls a bit better than some mice in MacOS and has USB C I decided to keep it. Hope it lasts longer than it feels like it will.",

                "reviewText": "I am a mac person and I have two mac mouses, but for whatever reason, even when charged, turned on and off, all things the way it should be with 'interference' they just crapped out with tracking well. I googled best mice, and this is the one that came up. For the price I figured I had nothing to lose! I LOVE IT! Tracks perfectly - easy to use, yes, it's plugged into my computer but I don't care because it works perfectly all of the time. Love it! It does make a tiny clicking sound when you use it. I don't mind that at all, but mention it, because my son was telling me he like the kind that makes zero sound. I think of it as the sounds of accomplishment;) Happy clicking!",

About 3 or 4 times a day I have to unplug it from the Mac and plug it back in to reestablish the connection. I don't know if there is a fix for this. It's not a huge issue, it just takes a couple seconds, but it's a bit annoying. Otherwise it works great.",
