If the game or software does not support these functions, the side buttons will not work. We also offer the SM900, a wired gaming mouse that supports macro programming and customizable side buttons. Q: Why don't the side buttons work on a MAC system? A: The previous version of the Mac system is not compatible with the mouse's side button, resulting in the unavailability of the side button function. Please upgrade to the latest system. Q: What causes the battery to get damaged? A: SM600 does not currently support the fast charging function, so please use the official USB charging cable to charge. The use of fast charging or high-power charging heads will result in battery damage. Q: Why does it consume power quickly? A: When using the SM600, turning off the RGB lights will extend the battery life to 15-20 days. However, if the RGB lights are on constantly, the battery life will only be about 1-2 days. If the user wants to enjoy the RGB lights and avoid frequent charging, it is recommended to use the device while charging. Q: What could cause the cursor to suddenly become stuck or delayed? A: If the SM600 runs low on power, the cursor may experience delay or lag, a common issue for all wireless mice. Please charge the mouse promptly when experiencing delayed lag. The SM600 supports charging while in use. If delay persists after being fully charged, we will provide satisfactory after-sales service. Q: How do I turn off the lights? A: Toggle the switch at the bottom of the mouse to the \"TURN ON\" option. This will turn on the mouse while simultaneously turning off the lights.",

(I connect 2.4ghz with my pc, and bluetooth with my S20 FE that I hook up to my monitor for Samsung Dex.My only caveat is that the side buttons are very sensitive. Very easy to press Mouse 4 when reaching for Mouse 5. It's a bit of getting used to your thumb positioning. Normally you're able to rest your thumb on a side button without it pushing down. If the manufacturer is able to resolve that issue, this will be a 5 star mouse easily.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a mouse a couple of months ago, filled with excitement about its sleek design and promising features. At first, it worked like a charm - smooth scrolling, precise tracking, and comfortable grip. However, my satisfaction quickly turned into disappointment when, after only two months, it stopped responding when i clicked it. Only the light stayed on such a scam.The mouse's sudden malfunction left me feeling frustrated and inconvenienced. I tried troubleshooting by changing batteries and reconnecting it to my device, but nothing seemed to work. It became clear that the mouse had an underlying issue that couldn't be resolved on my end.What makes this situation even more disappointing is that I had high hopes for this mouse. I was drawn to its positive reviews and the brand's reputation for quality. Unfortunately, my experience didn't align with those reviews.In terms of build quality, the mouse felt sturdy and well-constructed initially. It had a solid weight to it and the buttons had a satisfying click. However, the longevity of the product fell short of expectations.As a consumer, I believe that a mouse, or any electronic device for that matter, should last longer than a couple of months before encountering issues. I rely on my mouse for work and leisure, so its failure significantly impacted my productivity and overall experience.In conclusion, while the mouse initially showed promise, its untimely breakdown greatly diminished my satisfaction. I hope that the manufacturer takes note of these issues and works towards improving the durability of their products. If you're considering purchasing this mouse, it may be wise to explore alternative options that have a reputation for long-lasting performance.",
