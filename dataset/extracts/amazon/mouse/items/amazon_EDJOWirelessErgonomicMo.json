I've used better mice at this price point that had a built in battery, but this is still pretty good and hasn't given me any issues as of yet, which some of those started giving me issues with the scroll wheel after a few days.",

It was designed to for the most suitable shape for your hand so it prevents wrist pain even if you use it for a long time. There are also various functions, so you don't have to touch the computer keyboard. The design is so pretty too! I highly recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a new one",
