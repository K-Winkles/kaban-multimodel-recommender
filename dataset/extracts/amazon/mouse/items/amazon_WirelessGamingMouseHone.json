                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Does everything a mouse should",
                "reviewText": "I just needed an extra basic mouse. I had a wireless mouse I took back and forth from work and home because it was my preferred mouse. I got tired of moving that mouse around and decided to get a cheap and good enough mouse for work. I didn't want one of the super tiny compact wireless mouse, I really dislike those. I just wanted it to be full-size, light weight, and wireless. This mouse checks every one of those boxes.While it's not the lightest mouse I have ever used, it is lighter than a lot of regular mice. It's heavier than my current gaming mouse at home, but is lighter than some of my older mice. It's light enough that it's not a bother while working. The shape on this mouse isn't bad either. While I do prefer the shape of my gaming mouse, I find it to be more ergonomic, I found that I got used to this shape pretty quickly and it doesn't bother me day-to-day.I could have taken or left the lights. Again I'm using this for work, but my office is private and no one is going to see them anyways. I guess it's nice to have on nights when I work later and the office starts to get dark. I probably would have liked them more if they were diffused better. With the honeycomb design of the shell you can see straight inside the mouse and can see the actual LED's as they light up. They also only put the lights in the back palm area. The honeycomb design continues up into the mouse buttons, but this area does not light up because they didn't put any LED's in this area. The lights can also be turned off with a switch on the bottom of the mouse, but the mouse will also automatically turn off after a couple of minutes. Just click any button on the mouse to wake it back up.The forward and back buttons are nice to have and are clicky. The scroll wheel isn't too bad either. I can feel the individual clicks on the wheel as I scroll, but not as distinct and satisfying as some others I have used.You can't change the DPI settings (outside of the 3 presets) so you will have to adjust sensitivity in game if one of the 3 presets aren't to your liking. With all that said, I think this is a pretty good mouse for its price. Without getting into the nitty gritty of response times, which I am not equipped to test, this thing performs really well.",

                "reviewText": "With lights, a honeycomb design, and DPI control, this mouse is a great entry-level gaming mouse that is budget-friendly.With DPI levels up to 1600, this mouse boasts a minimum DPI level that qualifies it as a gaming mouse. Compared to cheaper mice or normal everyday mice that have DPI levels around 1200, this mouse will feel significantly more responsive. Higher DPI allows the cursor to move more with minimal hand movement, making it especially useful for games that require quick movements. For my girlfriend, transitioning from a regular mouse to this one wasn\u2019t so hard. However, if you have a lot of experience with gaming mice, you might find the DPI too low on this one.The back and forward buttons are nice additions that make life easier (I honestly think they should be on every mouse). The mouse is responsive to clicks, and the lights can be turned off using the switch at the bottom if you want to conserve battery life. Otherwise, the light cycles through 7 colors as you use the mouse. The mouse can feel slightly large if you have smaller hands, but it\u2019s not so large that it becomes difficult to use.Currently, this is priced at $18. Compared to similar products on Amazon, this mouse is fairly priced. However, for those who desire a higher DPI range above 1600, there are many options in this price range that offer that. Additionally, if you prefer a different shape of mouse, there are quite a few options as well that use the honeycomb design. So when it comes to mice, there\u2019s no shortage of options. Considering the price, I recommend this product to beginner gamers.Overall, this mouse would be nice for someone transitioning into gaming or activities that require quick and precise movements. However, for experienced gamers, this mouse will feel sluggish due to its relatively low maximum DPI.",

                "reviewText": "This is a more than decent mouse at this price point. It reacts smoothly when used and the buttons are satisfying enough to use. The honeycomb design isn't for everyone but it is nice enough to look at with the RGB lighting going. The wireless adapter works well enough though in certain instances it seemed weaker than some other wireless mice. Battery life was good and I found it could be used extensively without too much extra charging required. I tested it on a Mac so this may be specific to that use case but it seems, as if the DPI button doesn't agree with that operating system but it can be adjusted via the settings so it wasn't a big issue.Would definitely recommend for this price.",
