I started using this and it's crazy good. You have roughly 5-6 dpi settings maybe 1-2 more I haven't counted and I it has different color codes for the setting. The button can be found on the top under the scroll wheel and in between the left and right click. If you want to change the rgb mode then you press the dpi and back side button and the same time. To change the color it's the front one (the one closest to the top of the mouse) and press that and the dpi button at the same time. I would have rather it had a button separately on the bottom to change the mode/color but it's whatever I'll get it down soon. Such a great budget mouse for $20 I got it for $15 because it was on sale but still all in all a great mouse for the price and could compete with high end 50-60 dollar mice the only thing that would be cool to see tmkb to do is make a wireless model for like 25-30 dollars",
