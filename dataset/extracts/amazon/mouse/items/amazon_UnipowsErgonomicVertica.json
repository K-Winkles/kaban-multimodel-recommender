                "reviewText": "This mouse, Unipows Ergonomic Vertical Mouse, MBD7, is a knock off of the Logitech Lift Mouse. The Logitech MX vertical mouse is the standard for this type of mouse. The MX vertical has high quality and high price. But the MX vertical is also very large, good for a dedicated desk, but not great for anything else. So the Logitech Lift mouse was introduced, a smaller vertical mouse to fill the gap, and a lower price. The problem with the Lift mouse is that it feels cheap compared to the MX vertical and the price difference is not enough to justify it. That\u2019s why I wanted to try Unipows Ergonomic Vertical Mouse, MBD7, at its reasonable mouse price point. The listing page did not have much details about the mouse, so it was a bit of a gamble. But so far, this mouse has been a good deal.Features: DPI setting: 800, 1200,1600, 2400 Buttons: Left, Middle, Right, Page Up, Page Down, Close Window, & DPI SettingThe mouse feels sturdier than the Lift. The materials are all hard plastic except for the rubber scroll wheel. The MBD7 otherwise feels similar to the Lift. The mouse sensor tracks well on non ideal surfaces, like a bean bag chair, which most mouse sensors do not track well or at all.Not a big fan of rechargeable batteries in mouses as they seem to always fail, I will update my review is I encounter any issues.",

                "reviewText": "I've been wanting to try an ergonomic vertical mouse for a while now and this one is perfect. And pink, too!I use my mouse a lot for graphic work, and after working for long periods of time my wrist and pinky finger gets sore (I know that sounds weird, but its something about how my pinky rubs against the mouse when using it.)Using this mouse immediately feels comfortable and natural in your hand. Your holding your wrist, hand, and arm in a much more natural position. It does take a moment to get used to the movements of this mouse, and I had to change the mouse speed setting on my computer until it felt right, however, the buttons and roller are intuitive and the same as a regular mouse.It feels a little awkward when doing a lot of detail work with this mouse, but that may be because I'm still getting used to the new shape.The buttons are very quiet, and I like that it's rechargeable by USB C and it comes with an usb to usb C adapter and charging cable. Overall this is a really quality mouse. The buttons are smooth and quiet, and the mouse moves smoothly over my mouse pad. Well done!",

Different muscle memory for your hand and fingers.The bottom part of my hand is sore and red, almost need a pad for my hand and wrist to rest on now.So it is cool and works well. I like that it can be charged and that it is pink. Time will tell if I love it though or if I return to the standard mouse.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. More like a moving joystick, clearly it's thinking outside the box which allows the user to keep the wrist and \"firing\" buttons in a vertical position. A red led flash gives an indication of the mouse's DPI (dots per inch) setting. The mouse has an on/off switch that is colored red and green and leaves no doubt whether the mouse needs charging or it's turned off.The so called \"boss' button minimizes all open windows and leaves only the desktop showing. Another press of the button will re-store the desktop as it was. This button's function only applies to a Windows environment. It does take some \"mindfulness\" to adapt to the new ergonomics and the 'boss' button can get in the way when lifting the mouse of the surface.The site has an AI product support bot, very nicely done - though it failed to answer a simple question on how to check the DPI state. The MDB7 vertical mouse comes with a nicely printed user guide and a USB-C to USB A adapter to connect the mouse USB receiver if not using a type A port.Mac / Android platforms cannot make use of the fwd / backward / boss buttons. It does take some hand re-training to make use of them in the Wndows environment.",
