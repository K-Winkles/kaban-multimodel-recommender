                "reviewText": "The mouse is great for all things and has a weight system for better balance for FPS games or games that need precision cursor movements. The mouse fits well in the hand, buttons are easy to find and reach. The scroll wheel is rigid for precision scrolling but, has a release button for rapid scrolling.The one I have now, I have had for a few years and is just starting to have optical \"fuzzy\" moments. I have about another year or two on my current one so, I picked up 2 more! Future Proofing!I really enjoyed the model prior to this model of Logitech Gaming mouse and, they were one of my favorites to use. Then, Logitech discontinued that model for this one. I was suspect on it because, the weight system really makes a difference in comfort. I tried the G502 Hero and, I was instantly pleased. The comfort, weights, and durability was still there. The only thing I miss in the G502 is a slightly higher palm area. Other than that, the price is perfect for the quality you receive.",

                "reviewText": "i tested multiple logitech mice, including mx anywhere 3, m720, mx master 2s, m705, g502 hero, and the m650L, and m510.in terms of comfort i would rate them (higher is better):m510: 5m650L: 5g502 hero: 4.8m705: 4.5mx master 2s: 4.3mx anywhere 3: 3.8m720: 1.5*my hands are glove size, largein terms of features:mx master 2s: 5g502 hero: 4.6mx anywhere 3: 4.5m650L: 3.8m720: 3.8m705: 3.5m510: 1.5closest to perfect: the g502 and mx master 2s. g502 is more comfortable, has 3x as many programmable buttons, and has semi-quiet clicks, but lacks the magspeed wheel and wireless (and i found the cord not to detract from its usability). the mx master 2s has the most useful features but is a bit less comfortable. The 650L is also great as it has better ergonomics than other Logitech mice, has Bluetooth, has silent clicks, and the semi - free - scrolling wheel is great.the m705 is another recommendable choice. It's extremely comfortable and has the free scrolling ability (though without the magspeed). the main drawback with this mouse is that the pads on the bottom are rough compared to other mice so it doesn't glide as smoothly.the mx anywhere 3 is an interesting choice as it has the magspeed wheel and while it doesn't provide support for your hand it's not so small as to be painful to use for long periods, but it was the most expensive mouse I tried by a big margin, and the price doesn't seem justified.I think it's important to point out that the number of features a product offers is not as important as the usefulness of each feature to the individual consumer. E.g. The 650L has fewer features than some of the other models but I would still strongly recommend it for its practical day-to-day usability. features that i cared about in order of their usefulness are as follows (grouped into 3 tiers)Features that mattered most to me:magspeed wheel (automatically switches between ratcheted and free scrolling)basic free scrolling wheelsemi-free scrolling wheel (m650L)Smoothness of glidingFeatures that I liked but don't use oftenbluetooth wirelessnumber of programmable buttonsbluetooth connection memory for up to 3 computers.features i didn't really care about or that made no observable difference:high dpi supportrechargeability",

                "reviewText": "I love this mouse. Nuff said!Pros:1. This thing is crazy responsive and I really enjoy using it for gaming.2. Fits my hand and I don't feel I have to claw or strain to reach the buttons with my fingers, everything is just where I need it when I have to press the buttons.3. Works great even with some distance from the usb receiver. I sit about 8ft-10ft away from my big screen TV and this product is able to keep up with no delay even at that distance.4. Battery life is very good, I use this mouse everyday and it can go almost a full 8-9 days without need for a recharge on constant use. I can even use it wired while it's recharging A+.5. The software is very easy to use and configure, I also have a Logitech Keyboard and Headset and I can control/customize all of them from one central GHub app. it's great.Cons: It can be a bit pricy to replace, especially if it ever gets Phantom Click where either it registers a double click or no clicks. I had one before where this happened. While Logitech is great as a company, they will have you try everything under the sun to fix the issue before they will offer to replace it under warranty.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very good mouse, with a lot of customizable buttons. The ergonomics feels good and it's weighty and doesn't feel cheap. I like being able to adjust the weight of it. Someone complained about the scroll wheel being too heavy to click and it hurt, but I don't find this to be an issue. The scroll wheel actually feels very well made and you can set it to click scroll or smooth scroll which is a nice feature. It's a bit pricier than some, but you get what you pay for here.",

I do wish the cord was a bit longer, but considering it\u2019s so easy to swap to lag free wireless and it lasts 15+ hours it isn\u2019t a big deal.The mouse feels durable and felt right the moment I picked it up. I am coming from a Corsair m65, the sniper button is a littttlleee bit too far forward for me, if my thumb was a quarter inch longer it\u2019d be perfect.Definitely recommend if you are looking for a solid, lag free, wireless mouse.",
