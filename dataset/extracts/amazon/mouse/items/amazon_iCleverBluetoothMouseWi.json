                "reviewText": "This mouse seems to be very well constructed, and worked well with my Mac: silent buttons and scroll wheel, multiple device support, and rechargeable from a standard USB-C connector. The bluetooth connection to my Mac was solid, and I did not experience any disconnections in the week I was using it.I really wanted to keep this mouse, but after a few days, I realized that it was a bit too tall for me. With my arm resting on the desk, it was causing my wrist to be in an uncomfortable position, and the strain traveled all the way up to my shoulder, so I had to stop using it. I'm sure it would be a perfectly good mouse for many other folks though.",

                "reviewText": "The first one I got, the scroll wheel broke after a month (right outside of the return window). Customer service reached out and offered to replace the mouse anyway, and the scroll wheel seems to be fine on the new one. Thank you!The mouse is exactly what I was looking for. It's silent, and it's really smooth and comfortable. It's really high without being a vertical mouse, which is nice if you'd like some wrist relief but don't want to have your shoulder rotated like you need to with the vertical kind. Great alternative to some of the more expensive brand mice.",
