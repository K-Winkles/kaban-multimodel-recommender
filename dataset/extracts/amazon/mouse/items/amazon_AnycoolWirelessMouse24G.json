I do however would like better gripping on the side. With it being so smooth I have had it flip in my hand when I would grab it a bit aggressively. It does feel a bit too light weight but that could be just me being used to our old big, chunky, corded mouse. It has held up well for now but does feel like it could easily break if dropped. But again that could be me being use to our old chunky, heavy mouse. My son loves it because it is wireless and doesn\u2019t tangle with his collectibles that he likes to display near the computer. Comes with a usb cord that we use to charge it over night. One charge lasts about a few days but we don\u2019t use the computer constantly. Came packaged neatly and quick with no real set up other than charging it.",
