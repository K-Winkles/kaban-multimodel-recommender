If you are looking for a decent budget product this is a good choice. It is 'close' the the razor in feel. The USB cord is a little stiff and the mouse could weigh a little more, but with that said it's a good choice for the price.",

Not sure what they are, but obviously the highest one probably being 10000. And take into consideration, all of this is from a very cheap mouse. I wouldn't expect a $100 mouse feel to it, but if you don't think about it you really won't notice. Feels like it was made with care.",
