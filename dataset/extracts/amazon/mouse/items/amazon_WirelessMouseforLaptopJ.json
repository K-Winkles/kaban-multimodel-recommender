                "reviewText": "This mouse is very aesthetically pleasing!I spend a lot of hours at my computer and my wrist was really bothering me, I believe this product shines when paired with an ergonomic mousepad as well, as on it's own, the flatness of it may be a little uncomfortable and odd-feeling.I work and play at the same desktop, so when I play fast-paced games, the mouse can be a little hard to keep a grip on due to its design, but I wouldn't say this is necessarily a dealbreaker. For work, it is smooth, you can change the sensitivty settings to be whatever you require with the push of a button on the mouse which is really convenient.The clicker is quiet as well, so when I use it for my laptop on-the-go and I'm in the library, I don't feel like I'm being annoying to the folks around me.I've gotten a lot of compliments on this mouse so far!!Overall, a fine purchase for a little mouse that really isn't that expensive. I would reccomend this!",
