It comes with grippy tape but I don\u2019t feel like I even need it the mouse itself has grips in the design.I took as many comparison photos as I could to help anyone get a better idea of shape difference. (Not a whole lot)Hope this will help!",

                "reviewText": "The first reaction i had was that it is so Light. I thought that it may have taken some form of rechargeable batteries and started looking for the compartment. Given its internal battery it has a great life span. My experience so far it would seem to be 30-40hrs on a charge. With the supplied USB-c cable connecting the mouse to your Computer, in my case my Gaming Laptop. Has a Fast charge speed. Easily track the battery life with the Asus ROG Armory Crate software. The onboard RGB light in the scroll wheel is adjustable with before mention Armory Crate software. I've chosen to turn the RGB off to help maximize battery life. The mouse has great versatility being able to switch between Bluetooth, Cabled USB-c, and Wireless with the adjoined Wireless dongle tucked away under the mouse. The glide of the attitude is smooth and not undesirable. Supplied with additional skates, to use as replacements. The second set seem to be slightly thicker than the already installed skates. Mouse operation is intuitive as a mouse should be the buttons are solid and responsive, with pleasing \"Clicks and Clacks\". I am very Pleased with this mouse for my Gaming laptop.",

The battery life on the G Pro X superlight was ok, but it wasn't great. It also didn't support bluetooth, which is nice to have as I use two different computer regularly. Also the X is charged with micro-usb instead of usb-c, which should be a legal crime in 2024. The Final Mouse was a disaster on every front other than materials used. Every razer I've had was too heavy, and others just dont have the features.- Battery life is great- Battery indicator is really useful- Shape is great- grips that come with it are dope- very light and ergonomic- usb-c charging- built in storage for the USB dongle.This is the mouse to get. Get it.",

                "reviewText": "Mouse is... ehhhh. Clicking isn't really all that, the material and how it feels isn't really anything different than a default mouse that you would get with a desktop for free. The default detection for the laser is so low that at first my standard mousepad couldn't even pick it up and I had to manually change it with the software. It has terrible traction, I tried it both on my mouse pad because it felt like it had some drag or something on it so I put it on just clean flat wood desk and you could hear the bottom scraping. Overall it is just a really meh mouse, feels and operates like its a super cheap mouse, but wait its 150 dollars! Yeah... no. Huge waste of money and it was a huge relief to go back to my G502 Hero logitech mouse. I highly do not recommend buying this mouse, especially if you are an avid gamer and even more so if you like to grind out aim labs, because out of all the different mice that I've tried with my aim lab grind, this one is ironically the worst! Stay away from this mouse unless they miraculously half the price.",
