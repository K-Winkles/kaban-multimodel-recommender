                "reviewText": "I haven't bought a mouse in 10 years but recently found the need to have a programable button style one. I landed on the Logi MX 3S (i don't know why). I like all the programing features. It has more than I will ever need. The battery lasts an amazing long time. I'm on the computer 8hrs a day and I haven't charged the battery in 3 weeks. The one feature I like the best is the scroll wheel. You can \"flick\" it fast and it will free wheel. Or, you can scroll slow and it has the defined notches. Such a cool option.Now, the negatives. I HATE the software. Particularly, the Options+ software. I use 2 computers with one monitor at my desk. I got this mouse so I could seamlessly move from one computer to the next and the Options software is suppose to make that easy. It has a \"Flow\" option that is suppose to move the cursor from one computer to the next, by moving the cursor to one side of the screen. Well, it only works half the time. I'm usually having to uninstall and reinstall the software, disconnect the mouse and rediscover. And, it still has issues. I'm using this on computers both running windows 11. So, my next option is to use this with a 2.4gHz dongle and install the dongle into my KVM switch on my desk. That way the mouse WILL move seamlessly from one computer to the next when needed. But, Logitech DOES NOT include a dongle with this mouse. This mouse requires their specific Logi Bolt receiver for it to work with 2.4. So, none of the many dongles I have can be programed to work. Not even Logitech's Unified dongle. This is crazy and so frustrating! I'm not returning this item because I have used it quite a bit now. I won't be recommending any more Logitech items until they include a very simple solution to an otherwise flawed mouse.",

                "reviewText": "I am a professional software engineer and frequently work with browsers and software where I have to scroll literally hundreds, if not thousands of lines of code a day. This mouse is THE best mouse I have ever used in the 25 years I have been writing code.I have two of them... one uses a dongle and is attached to my Mac Book Pro and the other uses blue tooth and it's attached to my PC.Battery life is about 2 weeks without a charge and I used both them at least 4 hours day each (I switch between Mac and PC) -- which is another reason I purchased two.. the mouse behaves identically on for both the Mac and the PC.There are two scroll modes... which can be toggled by pressing the button on the top of the mouse. One mode give a tactile feel and only scroll a user defined number of lines. The other mode will free scroll as fast as the program will keep up with the scrolling.Setup : easy as 1, 2, 3. The mouse with the dongle is super easy. Plug in the dongle and start using the mouse. The blue tooth mouse. Go to settings and connect the Bluetooth mouse, start using the mouse. Getting either mouse \"up and running\" takes about 30 second or less.I can say. without hesitation. I would highly recommend this mouse to ANY body who does a lot of use with a mouse.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Worthy Upgrade to the Original",
                "reviewText": "The MX Anywhere 3 is, as the name suggests, the third generation of the MX Anywhere series of Logitech mice. For some backstory, I had the original, released way back sometime in 2008/2009. I have steadily used it until 2020, where it began to develop double click (however I wasn't mad as this mouse at this point was already 12 or so years old). I intended on switching to the MX Anywhere 2, but then I found out about the 3. Knowing the original lasted me longer than a decade, I was more than willing to give this new mouse a shot.LONG MOUSE FEATURE REVIEW BELOW! (These are my opinions on the mouse, others may have different opinions.)This mouse is definitely a step up from the original, heck even the predecessor, the MX Anywhere 2 (and 2S for that matter). The 3's design harkens back to the original, which greets me like a familiar face. The new mouse has an auto-switching scroll wheel, where the original had to be middle clicked in order to switch between line-by-line and fast scrolling (the new 3 also includes a new replacement button, where the the original's \"open multiple tabs\" button used to be, for those that would still prefer a button instead of middle clicking to switch scrolling methods). Furthermore, the strength at which you spin the wheel can be adjusted for different thresholds with the Logitech app!The shape is small, excellent for smaller hands, and is surprisingly lightweight. Including bluetooth has been a real treat, as newer computers no longer come with USB-A adapters (another reason I wanted to switch to a new mouse). And if you don't want to use bluetooth, the mouse still comes with USB-A adapter. This adapter is smaller than the original's, but be warned there's nowhere to really carry it in the mouse so put it somewhere safe if you're not going to use it! However, bluetooth response time is impeccable and smooth, and I have absolutely no noticeable latency even during high intensity gaming.The left side still includes the two additional buttons that can be mapped to have different functions for different apps! Unfortunately this isn't a left handed mouse, so please be aware of that! (As for me, I am left handed but prefer the mouse in my right hand, so the 3 is perfect.) If you use the Logitech Options app, mapping out the buttons is really easy! There are also a bunch of options including pointer speed, scroll speed, scroll method changing threshold (as I said above), and you can even change scroll default direction! These options are all personalized to your Logitech account, so if you want, you can even export these exact specifications to another mouse that you owned if you wanted to!In regards to color, this mouse is LIGHTER than the original. It's more of a charcoal grayish color (but then again the color is officially called \"graphite\") than a black. I would have preferred a true black option but the gray is nice, and fits in well with all other shades of gray and black. The scroll wheel is reflective metal, but doesn't stand out too much, and has an excellent tactile feel to it. On the sides there a horizontal \"waves\" that help provide more grip. They're not too overpowering and don't bother the my hand.A note, yes this thing practically works on everything! Glass, tinted glass, cloths of different colors, marble, wood, stone, literally almost any flat-ish surface!All in all, a MASSIVE upgrade on the original that not only harkens back to the original design, but still manages to find ways of improving! I highly recommend this mouse for everyone!",

                "reviewTitle": "Great for multiple Macs/PCs! Warning Double Click problems",
                "reviewText": "update: after a year usage my mx anywhere 3 compact mouse has a double click problem where everywhere that you click on clicks multiple times thus you cannot drag anything and closing a tab will close multiple tabs and so on. Drove me nuts and I thought it might have been a driver update or Mac OS update but it turned out to be a hardware problem as I bought another MX Anywhere 3 mouse today and all problems solved. I will still give this mouse a 5 star but I'll have to find out where to get this mouse replaced. Yup first world mouse problems. Otherwise great mouse after getting use to it. I use it on my gaming pc too along with 2 MacBooks with unifying receiver to ensure maximum resolution movements.update: so it was so hard to change over from my Apple Magic Mouse over to this MX Anywhere mouse BUT because I had multiple MacBooks to control, I had to try AND here is the verdict. IT DOESNT need a mouse pad to work! I found that my desktop works much better without that erratic mouse pointer jumping when I was using the metal mouse pad. The bluetooth operates a little further than the Magic Mouse so it was a bit more responsive at longer distance. charging with a battery pack and the connection cord is at the front of the mouse; no more useless upside down Magic Mouse charging!!! wooohooooo. You do need to adjust the mouse pointer speed so it doesn't move at light speeds (default) across the screen. Once everything is set up, the MX Anywhere mouse is a charm to use especially now using the back button on the side of the mouse instead of a flick of the fingers on the Magic Mouse; small price to pay for a single mouse on the table instead of three Magic Mouse. I think the thing that sold me is the usage of the mouse on almost any surface where-as my Magic Mouse needed a metal mouse pad to operate smoothly. Now my desk can has more room sans mouse pad.Old review: A desk full of mouses! The only reason that I did buy this MX Anywhere mouse is the ability to switch between 3 Macs/PC much like the old days of KVM switches. Except today with the Logitech MX mini keys keyboard and this MX Anywhere mouse the switching is on the keyboard and mouse and a HDMI switch. As you can see my tiny table desktop I have multiple Magic Mouse for switching between 4 MacBooks, Mac mini and one PC for VR. I just bought the MX Anywhere mouse to replace all those magic mouses. The MX Anywhere mouse is \"ok\" but if you having been using a Magic Mouse this is nowhere near the smoothness of a Magic Mouse especially the side scrolling but.... it is good enough and surprising that side scrolling is implemented, as that was my first question that I asked to no-one in particular and if you don't know, you hold one of the side button while your scroll with the wheel. With a Mac, the mouse is super sensitive and at a quick glance I did not see if there was a way to turn down the sensitivity within Logi options, you can with the standard Mac mouse settings but that means you will be turning down the speed of your regular Magic Mouse when you are using one. Now one thing for sure when I pair it with my PC (which I haven't) I am fairly sure that it would work perfectly with a PC as I have had so many Logitech PC mouses in the past and I am excited to use it for pc gaming as well as VR. yes PC VR gaming uses the keyboard and mouse. I think this MX everywhere mouse with the ability to connect up to 3 Macs/PC is the future of all mouses and it is a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "Truthfully, I fell in love with the colour. Also what won me over was that you can connect the mouse in 3 ways - traditional USB port, bluetooth for laptop and bluetooth for Mac. And you can seamlessly switch between laptop and Mac by choosing 2 or 3 on the bottom of the mouse. All fairly easy to set up. However, the bluetooth for laptop stopped working for me after a few weeks and I cannot figure out why because it still connects with my Macbook but somehow I cannot connect via Bluetooth on my work laptop anymore :( So I ended up switching to USB on my work laptop. Not the best but at least there's a fallback.Also it wasn't really clear to me what the Logi+ app is supposed to do (I guess you can set up preferences like which button does what, scroll speed etc). I have some problems running the app...oh well.",
