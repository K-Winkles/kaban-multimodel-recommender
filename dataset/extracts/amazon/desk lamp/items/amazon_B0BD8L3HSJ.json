It\u2019s ideal for mobility limited people, especially.However the bulb burned out in less than five months, and it was hard to get the right replacement. It requires DIMMABLE bulbs; first I ordered non-dimmable by mistake, and that didn\u2019t work well; after a few days, the bulb randomly would stop working, only to randomly come back on again. I learned, if the bulb goes from dim to bright, then back to dim before going off, it\u2019s not dimmable; it\u2019s three way, and won\u2019t work right.The seller sent me a link to a bulb listing that SAID dimmable, but when I received them, they were also non-dimmable (not lamp seller\u2019s fault). Hopefully my third bulb order will actually be dimmable, and work right!Don\u2019t trust any dimmable bulb listing under $9.95, that\u2019s the cheapest I\u2019ve found!",

The USB port isn't high power and won't really work on modern devices. The 120V plug works fine and I wish they just skipped the USB port.",

I\u2019m perfectly capable of repairing it, but after adding up the cost of a new plug, wire and a new shade I decided to look at a new lamp.The price on this was very reasonable. When it arrived I was happy at how sturdy it was and how the base is nicely weighted to avoid tipping. It looks nice even with my more traditional style furnishings.I really love having the touch activated switch late at night. Me only complaint is a minor one: the lighting levels are in my experience closer to 40, 95, 100%.",

I bought two, one for me too, and we are both very happy with this purchase. Delivered in record time, well-packaged and easy to assemble. The price was very attractive too!

                "reviewText": "Happy with this lakp. Works for our small living room table with a nice amount of l8ght. The charge ports work well and it looks nice. Only thing is that the 2nd and 3rd brightness settings are off, one doesn't seem to work or 'wigs out'. Wasn't a huge concern for us for our use, assume it is a one off. The other lamp I purchased at same time is a little different in desgin but relatively the same and oesn't have this issue.",
