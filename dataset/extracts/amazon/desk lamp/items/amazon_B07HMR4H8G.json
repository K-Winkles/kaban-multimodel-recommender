It gets a bit hot after a while, but never dangerously so. The 3 different color settings are extremely useful, and I find myself using the 25/50% amber light setting more often at night while I'm working on my computer than I do for painting. I'll probably buy another one to use as a double for painting. It gets bright, even during the day, but I'd like another one to reduce shadowing while painting at certain angles. Worth the money, has been holding up well.",

                "reviewText": "My major complaint (but to be expected for this type of lamp): you cannot change the bulbs, hence the entire unit will have to be sent to e-waste.My minor complaint (more of a slight irritation than complaint): the on/off dot functions for 2 choices of warm or bright light as well as on or off, which means you have to touch it 3 times to shut it off. If you have already touched it 1 or 2 times for other choices and forget, and then touch it 3 times, you have to do it again.Suggestion for improvement:There should be a touch-on dot for just on/off (it should be bigger and different than the others), another for warmth of light, and keep the current 4 that let you quickly touch a preferred brightness. You might also want to give the dots different textures for when fumbling around in the dark or for those with vision problems.Otherwise I love the size, shape, ease of bending the neck, the fairly large circular lamp head with non-glare hole in the middle, the sturdy base, the overall white looks, and especially the kind of lights it gives off. Very good over a work or reading area, or on low warm is a nice gentle light. I've only had it about 4 months so I cannot yet speak for the longevity. I use it frequently every day on all different settings.",

She has tried hand held magnifying glasses, little LED flashlights and nothing works as good as this lamp. She can finally do her puzzles in the morning paper. It\u2019s got such a sturdy base so no worries about it tipping over. Multiple options on the tone of light and the brightness. The light is in a circle so that it event distributes onto whatever you are reading. The gooseneck allows you to pull down close or raise up higher. The center is hollow, it\u2019s not a magnifier but you can peer through the hole and read or do crafts etc with the light evenly surrounding your project. I would recommend it. Great product for the price.",
