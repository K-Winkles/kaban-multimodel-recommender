I also love that it charges my electronics even when turned off.I bought one in blue for my sister and I will buy another pink one for me. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful lamp. Warm soft light that does a good job of illuminating entire room if you need to on all three settings. Got the pink one for my toddlers room so she can operate the Lamp independently. Works like a charm. Looks and feels quality. Sturdy and does not tip over because the base is nice and heavy.cons are minor: all areas of the light except for the shade turn the light on including the stem, so if you have to move it around it turns on but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose. Would be nice if the stem didn\u2019t also function as a touch so that you could move it without unplugging it.Other con is I tried a different bulb than the one that comes in it and it makes a buzzing sound on lower brightness settings. So replacement bulbs will need to be the same as the one it comes with.",

                "reviewText": "My dad stayed with us for the whole of the summer, and unfortunately, he has mobility and cognitive issues. We have most of our lights in home set up in Hue/HomeKit, so it was frustrating for him operating the nightstand lamp via Siri. He would bypass Siri and use the switch on the lamp, but it was your typical turn switch that he struggled with.I decided to buy this lamp so that he could just touch it to turn on, increase, increase, off, and we just removed it from Hue/HomeKit altogether. He told me he liked the touch on/off much better. It is also modern-looking and matched the grey bedspread we put on his bed. The USB port was helpful for his phone charger, too. All in all, it was money well-spent.",
