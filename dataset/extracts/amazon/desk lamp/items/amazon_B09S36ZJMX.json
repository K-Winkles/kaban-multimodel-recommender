                "reviewText": "Ordered and installed as soon as I got it. So far I\u2019m very pleased.Install was quick and easy. The arm is made of two pieces. Both are sturdy, top half is flexible and has openings on both sides to hide the wire that goes to the lamp. After install, my lamp is ~28in tall but it can easily go over 30in. Putting the two pieces took a little amount of muscle to put them together but it makes it so the top half of the arm is secure.Clamp is pretty good, all metal. The lamp wobbles with the table but it\u2019s very minor on my setup and hardly noticeable with regular day to day stuff.Everything works as intended for now. Lighting is excellent. Brightest lighting is very bright, picture shows 2nd most dim setting(not sure what temp setting). The dimmest setting is excellent as well in my opinion, the the change in brightness when going from 2nd most dim to most dim is very noticeable compared to changing between the other brightness levels.The different color temps/hues are noticeable as well.Now for the biggest reason why I bought this light\u2026 the AC power adapter. My last light was powered via usb and that one stopped working correctly shortly after. Switching to this to see if that is the root problem.I will give an update if I remember.3 months after my initial review, light is still working working without any problems! My biggest concern was if the wiring would hold up and it did. Switching to a AC powered unit was a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "If you look at the photo I've attached, there's a lamp on the left hand side. I was using it to illuminate my work area but it just wasn't bright enough. I thought this lamp might be able to work in conjunction with the other one but it provides more than enough light on its own. Actually, kind of stunning amounts of light.The lamp has adjustments for color temperature from a very warm to a very blue daylight as well as brightness. There are five brightness levels, and most of the time I have it on the middle amount of brightness and still it gives me plenty of illumination. I know some people have spoken about how it gets too warm, but I don't seem to have a heat problem and beyond that, I have no reason to touch the lamp once I turn it on from the switch that's in the middle, between the two light wands or whatever you would like to call them.I am very impressed with this product and look forward to it keeping me out of the dark for many years.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE AFTER 1+ MONTH OF USE: The CON is no longer an issue. The lamp did get hot on the first use, but it\u2019s never been hot since. I\u2019ve used it for several hours, then checked for heat, and found none - anywhere! I\u2019ve upgraded it from 3 stars to 5, and buying a second one!This light has lots of great things going for it, but the one negative is so major, I can only give it 3 stars.CON: The light arms get extremely HOT! We\u2019re not talking after an hour or two of being on, more like minutes into use. Almost too hot to touch!PROS: 1. Simple to put together and hardware included. 2. Sturdy once clamped onto the desk. I did put a furniture pad sticker on the bottom vice so that it wouldn\u2019t scratch the wood, but I have an antique oak desk. 3. The lighting is great and can be adjusted based on needs by: tone (push button); direction (adjusting the bend in the neck); or location (adjusting the light arms). 4. Since the light clamps onto the desk, it frees up more space on your desk surface (ie less clutter or more room for other stuff).Would I buy another one? Definitely.",

                "reviewText": "My computer monitors are a bit dim at my office than I liked.The company install a half length tube. It's a joke!I bought this to make it easier on my aging eyes.There are four main pieces.1. The seat that's holding the light on the table. Although there is a maximum thickness, it should accommodate most desks.2. There are two straight pieces. One is bendable. The lamp head connects to this piece. The other one sits between the seat and the bendable tube. This straight not bendable tube has two holes for the two included screws. The long one secure it to the seat. The short one one secure the bendable tube.4. The lamp consists of the switch and two arms and a transformer.The arm can be moved as the product picture shows. The transformer is a bit large. Make sure you have the space on your wall outlet or your power strip for it. The transformer connects to the lamp via a round connector. There are three switches on the control panel. After complete the set up, the left control the brightness, the right is for the color temperature and the middle one turns it on/off.With its full brightness, the light bounce off my monitors. I moved the arm around to find the right spot for my 3-monitor setup. The bendable piece is flexible to bend and strong enough to support the light. There is a groove on it to let you hide the wire.This lamp is really versatile to accommodate different needs. With different color temperature and brightness, I'm sure you would be able to find the right combination for your particular setup.It would be great to make it studier, more like a one-piece setup. Another possible improvement is to allow a bit of rotation on the lamp - may be 30 degree in/out to make it easier to not shine on the monitor and reduce glare. Without the upgrade / mod, it still works very well.",
