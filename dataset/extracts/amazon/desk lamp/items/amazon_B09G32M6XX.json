I generally keep it on bright white although the soft yellow was great for a night light when my daughter fell asleep in my office.",

                "reviewText": "I need a desk lamp for 2 purposes. First, I need some warm light at the back of my monitor in order to reduce eye strain at night. Second, I need a desk lamp for reading and writing. Since this lamp has a goose neck, I can bend it to satisfy both needs with ease. The light from the lamp has 3 temperature settings, this is important because you should only use warm light at night in order not to disrupt your sleep.As you can see from the picture of my watt meter, the lamp consumed 11.3 watts at full power with a 2A power adapter, this was very close to its stated rating of 12 watts. When I tested the lamp with a 1A power adapter, it still worked, but it only drew about 7.6 watts. This means that you get a brightness level of about level 7. In practice, this should not be a problem, since you don't really want to run the lamp constantly at level 10 anyway. This is because LEDs tend to deteriorate faster at high temperature. I intend to run my lamp at about level 5 most of the time, so even a 1A power adapter will do.The build quality of this lamp is very good.Incidentally, the lamp does not come with a power adapter, but you can get a 2A adapter from Amazon for about 4 dollars.",

It\u2019s the perfect lamp for any artist that needs to be able to see how color will behave in different settings. The only reason I\u2019m giving 4 stars and not 5 is because my lamp came with some odd yellow discoloration on the remote. I haven\u2019t seen any other reviews with this issue so I think mine was just a fluke. The yellow can sometimes happen on apple products in the same way if exposed to sunlight so it\u2019s no deal breaker for me.\ud83d\udc4d overall I highly recommend this light.",

                "reviewText": "This is the exact lamp I need for attaching to the desk below my loft bed. I set it up behind my computer to as a webcam light source that effectively bounces off the bottom of my bed. It's fantastic for this situation and takes up very little space. The lamp itself is terrific, light is nice, the look is nice.A few issues that I hope I can overlook, but have been confusing:1) this lamp would be 1000% awesome if it came with a suitable power supply. It doesn't. And the literature is contradictary. I went online to re-learn the electrical skills I needed to discern what power supply was actually needed...but again, the literature leaves a lot of guessing. Generally, a 12W appliance would most likely require 2.4A 5V power supply. This is what I'm using, and it appears to do the job. However\u2014the product description here says it's a 12 watt lamp, but the insert that came with the lamp says it's rated for only 10 watts. So who knows? I've read in the product description here that it needs a 2Amp power supply, and the insert that came with the lamp says it needs a 3Amp power supply. I hope I got it right, but there's not an immediate way for me to know given the lack of clarity.2) The lamp head gets quite hot quite quickly. It also cools off quite quickly when powered down.3) the clamp that attaches to the table is sturdy and good, but is not lined with silicone as the product description says, it's lined with foam on one side of the clamp. good enough for me, but I wish the provided info was accurate.I'll update here if any issues arise.",
