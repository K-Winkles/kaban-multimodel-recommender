                "reviewText": "I have a ton of junk on my desk, it's a bad habit of mine that no matter how hard I try I can never manage to keep it clear for more than a day or two. I also have a stupidly huge monitor that takes up 2/3 of the space, so when I finally do manage to clear off space to either paint, draw, or do homework there's very little good lighting to work by. I have a similarly shaped lamp that I now use in my basement workshop, and instead of bringing it back up I decided to get this one.The folding design is great for when I don't need to have it out, it takes up very little real estate on my desk. The light it gives off is nice and bright, and its easy to adjust the brightness if need be. It's nice that it also returns to the last used setting when powered on. The usb charging is a nice little feature, thought I don't really use it as I've got a usb hub right nearby.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice sturdy desk light. It charges my cell phone through its thick case. It is easy to turn on and off and easy to adjust the brightness and temperature of the light. It has 7 brightness levels and 5 temperature colors. The light is soft and doesn't get as bright as I would like. I like daylight. The light tilts upwards at 135 degrees and rotates 90 degrees or tilts down 150 degrees and rotates 45 degrees so there are a lot of options to position the lighting. The solid base keeps it from tipping over. I basically keep it in one position and my only complaint is I need daylight lighting to see better. This light will last 50,000 hours before you have to replace the entire light. This desk light is not UL-USA listed but it appears to be well made and CE certified for Europe so I have no issues using it in my home.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this lamp because there were dimensions listed that suggested it would fit specifically in my desk area. I note that those dimensions are no longer listed on the product page, which is good because they were incorrect, and the lamp doesn't fit upright in the space where I intended it. However, because of the various ways that the lamp can fold and rotate, I can still put it in that spot, even if the orientation isn't quite optimal. Even though it's at an angle, the solid weight of the base keeps it from tipping over. I really appreciate how I can adjust both the warmth and the brightness of the light. The standout feature for me is actually how the head of the lamp rotates so I can aim the light straight down or at an angle. I'll also just note that there is a USB charging port for a phone or other device, which is always nice but I just wanted to point out that's all that is (because it's prominently featured in one of the product photos and it might suggest that the phone somehow controls the lamp, which it does not).",

                "reviewText": "Even though this desk lamp doesn't have a gooseneck it can be adjusted in many different ways. Vertical pole can be turned around the base, horizontal boom with LED strip is both hinged and swiveled. As a result the adjustment is almost as flexible as with gooseneck setup except all connected parts are solid. Lamp has relatively large flat base and extremely stable. Digital dimmer has very wide range. LED strip has high color temperature which translates to high luminance at low power. The power supply rated at just 7W with USB charger rated at 5W. Lighting element is very bright and at first it is hard to believe that it only consumes remaining 2W. The trick is in relatively large active surface of LED strip and again high color temperature. Power supply has long cord and small footprint not cover more than one extension cord receptacle.",
