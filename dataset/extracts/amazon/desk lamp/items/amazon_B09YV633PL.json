Tons of light and you can choose different temperatures with a touch button. Cool to neutral to warmer. Also, touch adjustment for brightness. Arms rotate to change angles of the 2 light bars. This allows you to move easily under the light reaching for paints and water and tools. It is out of the way and doesn\u2019t cast annoying shadows with the two bars of light. Would be perfect for studying, crafting or sewing or really any other hobby where you need more light. Oodles of light and not so bright that it affects your vision. The brightness, as I said, is completely adjustable as well. Eye safe light. It\u2019s also very Light weight. Foldable to transport. Configuration allows you to move and work easily under it.It is absolutely perfect- and I hope it lasts!!! Fingers crossed.",

The brightness was amazing and the exterior feel was great too. Even though the external packaging is not very important, from a different perspective it does reflect if a product was responsibly created or not. The packaging of this lamp proved such a nice responsibility also (Thanks for this.). Good product!",

The fact that it bends in the middle is brilliant because you can get light from left and right. It would be better if it had one setting brighter than its maximum, but it is bright enough for most circumstances.The clamp doesn't work with many business-style desks because it doesn't open enough to get past the rail under the desks that hold the legs, and it doesn't attach shallow enough to be attachable outside the rails.",
