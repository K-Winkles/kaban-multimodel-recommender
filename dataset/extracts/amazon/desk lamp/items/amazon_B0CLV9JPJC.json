                "reviewText": "First, they must have updated the description on this since I ordered it, as I was lead to believe it was a 2-pack. I think for $50 it's a bit pricier than I would prefer based on this alone. Second, there was a small bit of assembly, which was fine, but unexpected. You have to tug the cord through the base, which at first is a bit intimidating because I worried I'd break it. But I worried for nothing, and then I was able to fit the harp and finial into the base. Third, the lamp shade comes rolled up inside out and it attaches via a strip of velcro. So unfortunately, that connection sticks out quite a bit. That said, we just turned the lamp so the seam was on the backside.Overall, I really love the ambiance it provides and it's really pretty and complements my decor. I do feel that $30-$40 would be a more appropriate price point.",

It's a very sturdy base and the easy of putting it together took me only a few minutes. Packaging was on point too. I love the design on the lamp base too. It's very well made and sturdy. I expect to have this lamp for many years to come! Love it!",

It's sturdy and solid, but not heavy.Assembly was quite easy- take the rolled up lampshade, open it and velcro the ends. Then insert the rings that shape it, and clip them in. Last, screw in the lamp socket holder. Could not be easier to assemble and takes only a few minutes.The result is a beautiful lamp, although you add your own e26 LED bulb to complete the project.The price point on this lamp is excellent, the lamp itself is lovely, certainly tall enough for a bedside table lamp, and it rates five stars.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really attractive little table lamp. The design of it seemed more like an oil rubbed bronze to me than a black, and I really liked that. I did opt to use our own lampshade on it though, because it fit our color scheme better. There's nothing wrong with the one included. I think it's a big plus that most table lamp sized lamp shades with a spider connector will fit the lamp. It takes a standard e26 bulb, and worked well with the smart bulb we wanted in it. The cord is ample but not overwhelming. I would guess six feet without measuring it. It is heavy enough that it shouldn't tip over or around, but light enough that you can carry it without strain. If you want to hit an intruder over the head with it like they do in the movies, I bet it would work well for you in that scenario.All said in done, this is a really nice lamp. We are grateful for it and would suggest it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a lamp meant for more of a small setting. It is smaller scale and worked great on a desk. I don't think it would be enough to illuminate a room. I like the dimensional pattern on the lamp base. It was enough to be interesting, but not so much that it created a competing color situation. The shade assembled fairly easily although I did have to tug the shade fabric snug along the 2 rings in order to get the velcro to connect once it was rolled all the way. I keep a small measuring tape near my desk. When I read the size of a particular item, I grab the tape measure and visualize what that measurement looks like in real life. I find that helpful so I am getting the right size item for the space it is intended AND so I am not surprised when something arrives.",
