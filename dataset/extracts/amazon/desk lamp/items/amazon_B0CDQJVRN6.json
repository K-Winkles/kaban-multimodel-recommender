The best part is that it\u2019s bendy and you can change the lights from warm to cool, both color and brightness. It\u2019s excellent for photographing my art and to work under (plus tall enough).When I originally received it the charging ports and nightlight would not work, and they were gracious enough to send me a replacement right out!

                "reviewText": "My office at home is kind of dark. But this lamp lights up my desk and keyboard very well without much glare. Fits behind my two monitors so it is out of the way. Also has cool colors at the base and where the light switch is.I really like this lamp and had to buy another one for my son's desk because he likes mine so much (before he steals mine).",

                "reviewText": "Great LED lamp with different color light and brightness. the LED base is the best part for me. It has 2 USB-A ports and 1 USB-C port and wireless charging pad. The LED base has different patterns and colors. The only small issue is that the touch buttons for the brightness does not work all the time. You have to tap it a few times to change the brightness.",

However... when it's on... for whatever reason the light that it puts out makes me feel sick. I can't even put my finger on it. I bought a similar one for my nightstand and I get the same sick feeling when it's on. Unfortunately I already threw the box away for that one so I can't return it. I do not recommend this lamp. I saw another review, after I got it, say something similar. Which verified that I wasn't imagining it.",
