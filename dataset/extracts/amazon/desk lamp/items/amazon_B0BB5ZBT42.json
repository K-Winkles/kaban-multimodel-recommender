You can point it in any direction you want, for any purpose you need. It can be bright enough to help you do delicate work, and soft enough to be a night light. You get tremendous value for the price.",

I needed a very tall one to clip onto the back of my monitor riser and still come up and over my rather large monitor, plus it's contemporary and sleek. The maneuverability of the arm/neck is unbelievably flexible; very easy to move & bend. I also like the fact that you can tilt the light strip section in two different directions so the light should never be in your eyes. Then there's the 3 different colors of light which is nice for daytime vs evening. I would definitely buy this product again and again!! Do it!",

I make a lot of handwritten notes, and read printed materials from time to time for work. So, I purchased this to attach to my computer desk to provide extra light on those occasions. For that, it has worked perfectly. I like that I can adjust the brightness, for me about 75% works well. I also, like that I can choose the color temperature, I typically like a warmer color tone and set it there, but sometimes I need to extra focused so I set it to a cooler temperature (more like bright daylight) to help me stay focused and energized. The lamp clamps to my desk firmly and easily and the gooseneck is rigid and does not shake or wobble once set into position.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a light for the corner of my living room that'd give off enough indirect light to be able to read a book on my couch. I was using Hue bulbs inside of lamps before, and it just wasn't enough light.I set up this flexible light on an end table and pointed it against some art and a geode I had - with some bending of the neck and tweaking, it became the perfect accent light for the room! Super bright for how compact the light is, I'm thoroughly impressed. The light is so sleek and minimal, it's like the lamp I never knew I needed. I never even turn on my Hue bulbs anymore, and have been really thinking about getting rid of the lamps around this section of the house to declutter and keep things really neat/minimal.I also love the fact it has 3 different colors. I mostly use it on the most \"orange\" (2700K) since it's easier on my eyes. If it's earlier on in the day, I may use the middle color which appears to be just natural white, or 4500K. Overall, this is probably the best and most used item I've bought in 2023, hands down!",
