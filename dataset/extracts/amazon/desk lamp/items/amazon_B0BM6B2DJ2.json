                "reviewText": "Yes, this lamp is on the large side; measure and be sure it works in your space so you don't cry about it later. It is metal with a heavy base for stability. Assembly is very minimal and the fit and finish on the one I received was perfect. I like that the switch is up by the light so you don't have to pat down the cord every time you want to turn it on and off. Not obvious in the copy or pictures is that in addition to the height adjustment knob on the lower stem, there is also a knob at the top between the shade and the top of the stem to keep the shade and light positioned where you want it, and the knob actually holds the shade in place, unlike so many others. The included bulb is medium/warm with just the right easy on the eyes brightness when trained on a work space. It might help to light up a corner, but there are other lamps to use if you want to light up your whole room. Overall this lamp seems well made and likely durable. It is good value if you like the industrial/retro design.",

I like the ability to adjust the direction and the height of the light. The finish does show the lines of the machining if you look closely, and the manufacturer responded quickly to an inquiry about it, but we realized that\u2019s not so important to us, and the quality is quite impressive. The lamps were well packaged and arrived quickly. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Sturdy base, easy to assemble, and keeps the room nicely lit when I don't want the \"big light on.\" I don't care for the \"brushed metal\" look the lamp has, as it just makes it look dirty to me. The bulbs have three different light modes which you have to cycle through, Warm, Cool, and Neutral. I'm sure they can be switched out to avoid always having to cycle back to the mode you want. All in all it's a sturdy lamp and does what it was meant to do while looking aesthetically pleasing.",
