                "reviewText": "Update -I am a professional sewist and have been using the lamp for my sewing projects. On high, the battery only lasts about an hour, maybe a little bit more. On the medium and low settings, it lasts longer. It charges quickly and can be used while charging, so that\u2019s a plus.Pros:- I love the adjustability of the angle of this lamp. Since it\u2019s a z shaped hinge, you have a lot of angle options.- The hinges are tight enough to hold the lamp in place at the angle you set it, but loose enough that it\u2019s easy to adjust.- I love that there are 3 brightness levels. The low is a nice low, medium is probably what most people like (I prefer the low), and the bright is really bright!- The power button is easy to access.- It has a small footprint for the brightness it provides.Cons:I don\u2019t love the pink color, but it\u2019s not too bad.I haven\u2019t used this lamp long enough to speak to its battery life, but it charged quickly. The light output is excellent. Over all, I think this is a great little desk lamp!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little light! I have vision issues and need brighter light to help minimize eye strain. I also frequently use my computer out in the living room, which doesn't have the same good lighting situation as my regular computing location. This light helps immensely. If I feel like things are too dim and it's getting harder to see, I just tuck this next to my portable monitor and it lights up the area around my laptop. This light folds up quite small so you can take it with you when traveling or working in a non-standard location. The light has three different lighting levels and it can get very bright. A simple push of the button turns it on, up, or off. The instructions mention charging it when the light got dim and I never noticed it getting dim, it just shut off a few minutes after turning it on if the charge is getting low. It comes with a charging USB-C cord but not a charging brick. Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to stow, rechargeable and a great value. I would buy this again!",

                "reviewText": "This lamp charges through a USB cable and can be used while plugged in or on the battery alone. The lamp takes 2 to 2 3/4 hours to recharge after being completely depleted to where it automatically shuts off the light. The web page states \u201c...with 3 Lighting Modes and 5 Brightness Levels.\u201d Unclear on what is meant by this in that only the button controls the 3 brightness levels. Also the color temperature of the light is closer to a blue-white which can be tiring to the eyes after extended periods. Something more in the 3500-4000\u00b0K range might be kinder to the orbs.Testing on the Low setting, the light remained on continuously for about 7 hours (not 10), testing on Medium it lasted about 3 \u00bd - 4 hours and on High it went out in a little under 2 hours. The light was fully recharged and tested at each of these three settings several times to get an average run time. In intermittent use the total amount of On time may in fact be greater as the battery has some time to \u201crecoup\u201d between uses.The adjustability of the head of the lamp is quite flexible and should suit most desired lighting situations. The only thing which would make it more flexible would be if the light head rotated.The unit produces more than enough light to read or perform hand tasks by and its light weight and small form factor make it easy to take to the work rather than the other way around.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my small and cluttered bedside table and it's great.A few things in the description are not accurate. It has 3 brightness levels but you can't change the warmth of the light. And I wouldn't call it \"touch\" - you have to push a button. That said, I find the button easy to find even in the dark. You push it 4 times to cycle through the brightnesses and back to OFF.The folding design is clever. It is lightweight and very compact when folded up and would be easy to travel with. I plan to use it when I go camping, as well as at home.I like that you can just keep it plugged in and never think about charging it, but it also has a battery. I have frequent power outages and I can see that this is going to come down to the kitchen when I am trying to cook in the dark. It throws a great light.Because it is so lightweight if you extend the neck to the maximum, it becomes a little top heavy. Fortunately, it throws such a good beam that I can read in bed without extending the neck that far.Very happy with this: the small footprint, the amount of light and the fact that it has a battery.",

                "reviewText": "Lightweight and compact. We ordered this folding lamp mainly for my wife's military deployment trips, so that she would have good lighting at her bunk station, whenever she needed it:Likes- Its Pink!- 100 hours of use from one charge.- LED Low energy consumption light. Minimal heat generation.- 3- Light brightness settings.- Folds completely flat and therefore takes up hardly any bag space.- Small and compact so it does not take up a large space footprint from your desk space.- Rubber feet to prevent sliding off table top.- The price is fair, for all the features and convenience provided. But, look out for those coupons and sales to make it an even better deal!Cons- This lamp is made entirely from plastic. This is extremely lightweight and functional. However, one fall from a table top and there is a strong chance that this lamp could be toast!- All hinges eventually wear. With continual use. one wonders just how long these hinges will continue to hold the lamp in a fixed position.SummaryOverall, we both like this lamp for all the reasons that we listed above. This will be perfect for my wife's travels, provided that it survives the long-term durability tests.",
