I've been trying for a while to get the lighting just right. I happened across this product while scrolling in an effort to level up my lighting game. And even though it's taller/wider than I thought - I've received more compliments of my lighting for zooms/virtual meetings in the last month than ever. Lots of lighting options, and can bend to help fit some various spaces. My only suggestion for the developers would be to have a larger base to attach on a desk to give the product a little more stability so it doesnt wiggle as much when the desk is bumped.",

It has a lot of functions that allow for different lighting and does not disappoint. I watched a review video of someone that had to tape theirs together, but mine was fine but you have to make sure you flip it correctly or they do not go together. Anyway. Good product and is very sturdy and does not sag. Very adjustable.",
