This reaches high enough that it\u2019s well over your monitor and offers different lighting tones (warm, cool, neutral) and the intensity can be adjusted. Well worth the money!!",

I had to jury-rig it for a steady support. The lower portion of the lamp does not properly secure the stem into the base. The lower stem is not thick/wide enough for the screw tightener to secure it well enough to avoid wobbling. I rated the item four stars because of this problem. Hooray for duct tape. Wrap it around the stem, place in base and then secure it with the screw tightener.",

It illuminates my clients hands and makes it so that I can see what I need to without any extra lights. It does get a bit warm so I just make sure to turn it off after every client. I love the gooseneck for different angles of light when taking pictures. It doesn\u2019t topple over when I move the light, and it doesn\u2019t flicker or turn off. It was almost too easy to install. Overall, it\u2019s a good buy when it\u2019s on sale!",

This takes up much less room. I only use the high light setting and the different shades don't do much for me, but it does what i want. It would be nice to have the switch closer to the base, but it works. the switch is about 16 inches from the base. I do like the illuminated on - off switch.",
