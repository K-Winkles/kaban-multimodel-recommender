I got the longer neck and am glad I did. It is a sturdy lamp. The included bulb does indeed switch from warm to bright white. The lamp does not run hot. I can put my hand on the shade and it's just about room temperature. My only complaint is that the bottom is not flat so it wobbles a bit. Not a problem for me because it sits on my heavy, metal, classroom desk. It wasn't worth returning. I like this product well enough that I do plan to order a second one.",
