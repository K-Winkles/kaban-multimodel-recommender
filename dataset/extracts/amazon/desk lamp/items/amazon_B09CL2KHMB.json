                "reviewText": "I needed a simple lamp with a long enough neck to reach over my computer monitors. Most of the desk lamps I came across were too short or the longer \u201cgooseneck\u201d lamps required mounting to the desk, which would not work for me as my desk has a hutch. The base is heavy-duty enough that there is virtually no chance of the lamp tipping, which I really appreciate. The dynamic lighting adjustments offered with brightness and color are really nice. I didn\u2019t need or want an overly bright light so I keep the brightness almost to the minimum setting and the color somewhere in between cool and warm. The pictures I took actually make it appear as though I have the brightness turned up, but that is not so. As you can see though, it\u2019s a perfect fit and illuminates my work area sufficiently.For the price, I find this to be a decent quality lamp. As long as it continues to function properly, my 5 star rating stands.",

My office is a small room with small furniture and all the desk space is necessary for things other than the lamp. All it takes is a touch to turn on, or dim, or change the quality of the light. When it's bright, it's very, very bright. So glad I found it!",

Fit and finish is impeccable and the goose neck looks like it was made that way no matter how you position it. The light quality is FANTASTIC.Assembly was easy, and it's like they already knew I would spend an hour looking for a screwdriver, so they included one. They also seem to know that there was a 90% likelihood that I would lose a screw, so, yup, there is an extra one. I will probably unscrew each screw and replace it with a drop of blue thread locker.The only negative is that it was shipped in an unsealed box. Outside of that it is very well packaged with lots of protective foam.Overall I'm very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this item and I wish I had bought this earlier. As I am working from home, I have to either sit in a dark room or turn on the room lights at night. Since I do not have curtains and have windows on two sides of the room, I have been hesitating about turning the lights on which would expose the entire room to all the neighbors. So finally I decided to get a desk lamp (that I have never heard of before) because of my friend's recommendation. Now, I can use my laptop with enough light while the room is very dark and I am probably not very visible either.The packaging is wonderful, all parts are secure with foams inside the box. The assembly took about 1-2 minutes and I did not even need to look at the manual. It comes with all you need: 4 screws and a screwdriver. I love it when manufacturers think about customers and put everything inside the package. It has a durable silicone neck that you can adjust the lamp bar with. The lamp bar has 4 switches: ON/OFF, auto-adjustment mode, color temperature, and brightness settings. The base is very stable with 4 stoppers at the bottom. Even the lowest brightness provides enough light for reading. This is an absolute game-changer. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Over the past few years I have tried many desk lamps for my home office. This white LED desk lamp takes the cake. Here are my pro\u2019s to the product:First I will mention that shipping was fast. It came in a nice sturdy package. It was very easy to install. Secondly, I would like to mention that it is a overhead desk lamp so it is perfect lighting for your computer screen but does not glare into your eyes. It also takes up the least amount of valuable real estate on your desk. The light is flexible, and you can change the light mode to warm or cool lighting depending on your preference. I liked it so much that I purchased 3 of these desk lamps.Are they expensive? Yes that is the only con that I can say about this desk lamp. It is quite pricey for a desk lamp but if you think about it, you use it all the time when you are sitting at your desk. So it is worthwhile to invest in a good lighting to avoid straining your eyes.Do I recommend it? Absolutely 100%!",

                "reviewText": "Happy with the lamp's function and design, it does what I want...but it's not cheap, especially if you are on a budget.My only gripe is that the lamp was supplied with a mains plug for USA(?). Why would an item be offered on amazon.com.au (Australia) for supply to Australia and the description NOT mention this important fact?! Inexcusable laziness or indifference by the seller and it meant that I had to buy an adapter before I could use the lamp.(I found the lamp was much easier to use when seated after I stuck labels on the lamp's top bar showing the location of each out-of-sight touch button. That might sound anal but it saves me having to get up from the chair each time to see where a button is to make an adjustment to the lighting).",
