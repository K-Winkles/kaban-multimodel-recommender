It features two adjustable gooseneck heads, five color temperature settings, five dimming levels, and a sturdy clamp for secure mounting.The two adjustable gooseneck heads allow you to direct light precisely where you need it, making it ideal for tasks that require focused illumination. The five color temperature settings provide a range of light options to suit your mood or lighting preferences, from warm and cozy to cool and energizing. The clamp ensures that the lamp can be securely attached to desks, tables, or other surfaces providing a stable and wobble-free lighting solution. Just make sure you measure the depth of your surface to ensure the clamp will fit.The goosenecks have limited motion and they didn't extend as far as I'd prefer. Other users claimed the lights were not synced, but I've had no such issues so far. I also read about light-flickering, but hadn't had those issues either.The dual-head design, five color temperature settings, five dimming levels, sturdy, wobble-free clamp, and LED bulbs make this a valuable addition to any workspace. While the dual heads have limited range and extension properties, this is a minor inconvenience that can easily be overlooked for all the other features present on this desk lamp.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a nice, bright, desk lamp for my craft table for the longest time. I wanted one that would stand on the highest shelf of my craft hutch, that sits at the back of the table. And I wanted it to shine down with a perfect, bright, white, natural daylight light. In my search, I've found a few that would work, at prices upwards of $100-$200. Even those weren't exactly what I wanted. Then I saw this lamp, and thought I'd give it a try. It was a little fiddly to put together, but it helped that I was able to clamp it to the edge of my granite countertop while I worked on it. It's so tall! Which I love! The base went together fairly easily, and so did the middle section. Then, according to the somewhat sketchy installation directions, I was supposed to push the electrical cord into the little channel that runs along the side of the vertical bar that forms the center of the lamp. So I started to do that. It was a little tough, but then I came to the little silicone bump-out where the bottom and middle parts of the lamp pole join. And I realized the cord would have to be run on the outside of that, so that it shows kind of awkwardly. I thought the instructions were wrong, and that I should have placed the cord before I joined the two parts together. So, like any rational person, I took it apart again, to place the cord \"correctly\" so that it would run the full length of the pole without showing on the outside of it. Sadly, this didn't work. There is no room on the inside of the little silicone piece for the cord to run inside of it. I had to rejoin the top and bottom poles, then continue to push the cord into the little channel, except for the 2\" where it just stays outside the channel. I know I've made this sound like a big deal, and to some people it might be, which is why I've included it here. You can see what I'm talking about on the 2nd picture, which shows just the little join between the upper and lower poles of the light. From any distance (see other picture), you can't see it at all. Other than the time it took me to disassemble and re-assemble the lamp, there was no problem. It's hard to see in a photo, but that light, falling so it covers the entire top of my craft table (apologies for the mess, but that's how it always looks), is everything!!! I have struggled for years with lamps that don't throw enough light, or have such oddly colored bulbs that they ruin my color awareness of the card materials I'm using, or don't fit where I want them to fit. This lamp is going to work perfectly in my space. The gooseneck feature means that it can bend to place it closer to your work space, or higher up, as I've placed mine. This would be great as a lamp that could come over the top of a computer monitor, too, or two monitors, if that's how you work. The slender profile of the post makes it infinitely adaptable to any working situation. It also comes with a remote (battery included). It has 5 different light modes, from soft beige to super white; and 5 brightness settings, as well. Something for everyone! My original plan was to clamp it to the back of that highest shelf, which would definitely have been better, however, my hutch does not have an overhang at the back. That's not the fault of the lamp, and it's going to work just fine clamped to the front edge. I feel this is such a versatile lamp, that could be used in so many ways, for so many people. And it's a great value, too!",

                "reviewText": "Hello there, nice to meet you! ;o)When I first saw the listing for this huge, double head LED desk lamp, I knew it was perfect for my work of researching (and some restoration work), on many levels.A reality check:This lamp requires some assembly, and for me, it did go awry. Usually I have no issues putting all kinds of items together-- it's the nature of my work actually. ;o)This light comes in a kit, with everything organized in an orderly fashion for you to put it together from the top of the opened box downward. This kit even came with a fairly easy instruction sheet to follow... up to a point. When pre-drilled holes don't line up for the clamp base to the first part of the post, it kinda stopped me in my tracks. I literally spent over an hour trying to assemble the first part-- only to find mismatched drill holes that won't let me insert the skinny 'cross' bolt, with a nut to finish process. I went to other steps of assembly and that went okay. But here's the rub-- there was no way I could stand this post up in the clamp portion, because I couldn't insert what now is a very important bolt to allow the lamp to 'stand up.'I did try to work with this lamp, to estimate how well the upper part of light will work for me, and found the gooseneck section and the double light itself to be rather flimsy and given to wobbling. This abberation in itself, defeats the purpose of having a high desk lamp with great light coverage that I had I high hopes for, I'm sorry to say. To say I'm disappointed, is an understatement!I really tried to fix this situation I arrived at... my hubby even redrilled the problematic holes at the base of this light to rectify the problem. It kinda sorta gave me a hint of what the working light could've been, and it looked terrific despite the desk lamp's drawbacks.In all honesty (and sadly), until these aforementioned issues are resolved, I find it difficult to give this interesting desk lamp a high recommendation.**********************************************************Have a wonderful Fall Season! ;o)Cheerio and Best of Luck in all your endeavors! Hopefully, this review was helpful.",
