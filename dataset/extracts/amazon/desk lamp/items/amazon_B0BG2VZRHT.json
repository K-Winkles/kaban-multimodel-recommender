                "reviewText": "I purchased this after trying another model that didn't fit behind my monitors. My monitors are essentially pushed up against my wall so this light worked well because of the small profile where it attached to the desk. I included a picture of the clamp to the desk, very sturdy. Obviously you twist the knob to tighten the pressure so it's also easy to remove! I really like the adjustable arms, my monitors are at an angle to each other so this is perfect. The different light settings (temp of color and intensity of brightness) work well! My ceiling light is behind me so this also doubled as a ring light when I am on calls, and helps illuminate my face. I am super happy with it. I receive comments on it when colleagues visit my office and have seen a few purchase their own as well!",

My only problem is the mount. If you have a desk that's against the wall like mine was, it's going to have to be an inch away for you to mount it (or I suppose you can do without the screw, but that might cause the lamp to be unstable). Luckily my desk has a shelf I can attach it to, but even then, I had to attach it upside down or it wouldn't fit. Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price. Would recommend",

                "reviewText": "Love the light and the fact that it has a base, not a clamp. Great variety of lighting options. The only thing to note is that the flexible arm was packaged bent the wrong way, meaning that the light part clipped on upside down. After unscrewing the fitting and turning it over, then struggling to get the lead plugged into the head, I realised that I should have just bent the flexi bit the other way. DOH!!!A bit expensive but now I have it I don't regret buying it.",
