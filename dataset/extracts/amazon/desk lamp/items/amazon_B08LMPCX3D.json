Literally laughable! This has been perfect. Lights the tabletop perfectly. Huge improvement. Love the dimming switch as well as the warm or white light. The ability to manipulate it is amazing too! Slim and pleasing to the eyes.",

I use it to brighten up a corner that gets very little light but i have a few ornaments that i would like to be more visible. The dimmer switch is perfect for what i need. and would be really helpful over a computer ,or just a desk. Definitely worth the money..",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice desk lamp that has a sleek contemporary look to it. The white colour works well with my white desktop and keyboard, and I like how easy the controls are to access and operate. I also like that it folds together so it would be easy, for example, to take the office if needed.There are two downsides: (1) the light does not dim very low, and (2) the lamp is not all that sturdy/stable. I have the lamp sitting on a side table beside my primary work surface and in that location it does not move much. However, it does wobble if I happen to move the side table, so I am sure it would move often if it was sitting on a main work surface.Also - although I cannot say this is a downside because I read this in the description and knew to expect this - the light itself does not turn from side to side. It would be great to have another model that offers this feature.I would say if you are looking for a sleek lamp that provides a normal-to-high amount of light, this would be a good choice. If, on the other hand, you are hoping for something that will give you a normal-to-low/ambient amount of light, I would look elsewhere.",
