Easy to set up, takes up little to no room, adjusts to height you need for different things (down over papers or facing outward to help light up the room), sturdy, and cannot say enough good things about this lamp! You could even clamp it on to a raised bed (in a dorm, bunk bed or for an overhead light for your bed - clamp it onto you headboard) for light on your bedside! On the pricier side for a lamp. Although, being LED (long lasting), the space saving, and adjustability it worth the price. 3 color modes ranging from warm to white. Adjustable lighting from 10% to 100% brightness. Remote (convenient if you use it as a bed side lamp!)!!! Flexible gooseneck, so easily adjusts to your perfect angle and height! Slender, wide design to cover a large surface area. Must buy for any college student, office, and home!!!",

Great value, as long as it will last (read note).Pros:Fairly sturdy. Minor con, the diffuser panel has a little play to it.Bright. It lights up my desk very well, and adds dim light to the whole room all by itself (Can't really tell on the video). Color rendering seems pretty good, and the color temperature presets are quite satisfactory.Ease of use. Touch controls work smoothly. The remote works well, not absolutely necessary, but the presets (nightlight, reading) and timer are nice to have. The gooseneck has good reach as well.Cons:Lowest brightness setting is too bright to be a night light. I don't use nightlights tho, so it doesn't bother me.The touch control only sense right in the center, so you have to be a little accurate.The neck has a tendency to loosen out of the base a tiny bit, if adjusting the lamp orientation.Note:I had to issue a replacement, because the first lamp died within a couple of hours. The replacement works fantastically. There is also a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, I registered and got a response fairly quickly. So, I hope manufacturer will have my back if the lamp fails later on. I will update if anything happens.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I have enjoyed these lamps very much. So much that I own two of them. I have an L-shaped desk 55\" to either side and use one in the middle of each leaf to light my whole desktop. The remote is handy and controls both lamps. However, I have had issues once in a while when I attempt to turn them off, the remote will turn off one but not the other. Which causes them to get out of sink. Easy fix, just tap the top touch sensitive power switch and turn the other one off and then they are back in sink for the next time you use your remote.Also I have light sensitivity issues with my eyes and am easily prone to getting migraines. With the different light temp and brightness settings, its a non issue as I can easily adjust the light source of both lamps simultaneously to match however I'm feeling for the day. These lamps are dim enough to not over power my computer or drawing when using my light pad, but bright enough I can easily see to read, write, and draw without straining my eyes.A plus and minus though, the neck of the lamp is adjustable and flexes whatever direction you want it to go. While this is nice for initial placement once you have it set how you want it, I recommend leaving it alone after that. From past experiences with items of this nature, with flexable necks, the flexibility can become loose over time from bending too much and the weight of the light head can drag the neck down keeping the lamp from staying where you want it. If you find that you need to adjust the placement of the light head frequently then this might not be the product for you.",
