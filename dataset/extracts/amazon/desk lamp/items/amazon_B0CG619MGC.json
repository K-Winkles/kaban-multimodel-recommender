This desk lamp comes with a USB connection and does not include an adapter. Please use a 5V 3.5A plug for power, which you will need to provide separately. Why is there a buzzing sound when the lamp is turned on? The presence of this sound is not considered normal for the product. It may be due to an incompatible adapter. We recommend trying a different adapter with specifications of 5V 3.5A to see if the issue persists.",

                "reviewText": "I'm setting up a VERY small hardware (DAWless) music studio for live jamming and needed decent light that covered the entire desk area. Bought a couple f FAILS before this one, so.. my hopes were modest.First, this thing is decently solid. Not super strong but will go the distabce for me.Second, the light is bright enough to see the labels on all the knobs and buttons on my gear, and being visually impaired, this is DAMN impressive!Third, it moves easily if I want to get it over a specific module for editing, Major plus!Finally, assembly took 3 minutes and that includes drinking coffee! I didn't even need my glasses to get this working, holy hell, that's a first!!The remote is nice, I can turn the light on and off from my DAW station across the room.Yes, I am old and lazy, heh.If the gooseneck were a bit stronger this would be nothng but 5 stars.There's a good chance I'll get another for my DAW desk to light up my 2 MIDI master keyboards. My current light is a hack, ugh.Quite happy!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a portable lamp to do my nails and this one is perfect! The clamp connects to where I need it and it doesn't move once I close it. The cord needs an adapter to plug it in but isn't included. I just used one I had for a cellphone. The actual lamp moves easily to adjust it to where I need it to be and stays put. It has a panel of controls on the cord to turn it on, brighten it darken, and change the light type. The highest setting is very bright! It's perfect for helping me see when I'm doing detailed nail art. The lowest setting is good for when I'm reading but don't want a glaring light. For the price, this lamp was everything I needed!",

Very functional, very bright, perfect for my needs. Goose neck is a little unstable, but make sure the bottom of the neck is tightened into the clamp. I secured my neck to my monitor stand with some rubber cable ties and it is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "The packaging was nice and neat, everything was wrapped properly to be delivered safe.As I unpacked the lamp, I noticed that the connector between the lamp and the goose neck has varying gaps (see the photos), which doesn\u2019t affect the functionality but it\u2019s something that caught my attention.The table screw was easy to install, it has a small soft pad to prevent any scratching of the table surface, which is nice because I have a glass table.The length of the cord is perfect, it\u2019s not too short neither too long, just right. The switch is convenient and easy to use.I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the brightest lamp I\u2019ve seen, but I definitely like that it doesn\u2019t take much space off the table surface and is very versatile to use. Horizontal lighting does bright up the working surface evenly, which is great, too.The length of the light stria is a bit less than 27\u201d monitor width (couple of inches shorter), so if you expect to set up the lamp right above a monitor, keep it in mind.I liked having options for light temperature, I usually work with the neutral light and read with yellow light on. The light brightness is a convenient setting, too. But I usually use the max one.After all, nice lamp, but considering the price and size, I honestly expected better assembly quality. Also, the gooseneck makes these cracking noises sometimes, so after all I give it 4 stars. Would recommend it though, as it is a quite easy and minimalistic solution for working space.",
