                "reviewText": "I bought the lamp to connect it to my amazon smart light bulb to create a smart lamp. The lamp is kinda finicky with smart light bulbs, and works! Its just there\u2019s a delay between turning off and turning on the lightbulb from the switch so pairing lightbulbs takes awhile because of the resistance or voltage or whatever. Another couple issues I have is that the plastic clamp broke because the lamp is kinda heavy, and the lamp base is kinda big, so if you have a small desk it\u2019s going to take up a lot of room. Otherwise the lamp is great, it looks really nice, and functions great.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp is actually even more beautiful up close than in the photos! It's actually not even completely black & bronze, it's more of a charcoal & bronze... quite stunning!! It's also high quality! Maybe something on it will POP OFF in a few months, but just on the initial plug-in & test, the movements are silky smooth, and the bronzed metal is so smooth that it actually feels \"SOFT\" - I know... weird! The biggest bonus for this lamp is - it comes with a heavy BASE... AS WELL as a table clamp - WOW!! I've never seen that before.TAKE NOTE - It (((DOES NOT))) come with a bulb, which was only a slight inconvenience. I was able to pop up to Home Depot and get one - they have HALF-AN AISLE fulla different bulbs to choose from, so I can understand why they didn't include one! There's SO MANY to choose from, that picking one out becomes almost a \"Personal\" decision - based on your individual likes & dislikes. I purchased the 60watt \"CLEAR\" LED bulb rather than the \"WARM\" one because I'll be working on projects in that room where it's at. When I turned it on.. WOW! \ud83d\ude2eThe light is SUPER-BRIGHT & CRISP (if that makes sense) - An EXCELLENT work lamp! I mean, I've had 3 or 4 of these adjustable-arm lamps over my life but they were ((NOT)) on this level!!There's only 2 things I would change on this lamp if I had my choices... 1). The switch is on the CORD, but I'd rather it was on - either the base - or the top of the lamp-head itself. I hate trying to find the friggin cord so I can turn a lamp off. 2). It would be cool if it had a built-in dimmer on the switch. I'd probably almost never use it anyway lol... But it would just be cool to have the option - since the bulbs it takes ARE \"dimmable\"Those are very minor nitpicks though, but other than that - I'm surprised how awesome this lamp really is.Just a 60w bulb turns that whole room into DAYLIGHT hours!! Yeah, I know... that's the bulb - not the lamp! But who wants to light up a room and look at an ugly lamp? lol... Top notch gear here!! \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this desk lamp.I had a similar goose-neck desk lamp for many years and for some reason - perhaps metal fatigue - the connecting area where the lamp inserts into the base gave out. Anxious to find a replacement, I searched online only to discover that the US company that manufactured my original lamp no longer exists - but I found a very similar one here on Amazon. When it arrived, I immediately saw that it was a super cheap version of my lamp: the base was made of plastic and the connecting section was a bad fit so the lamp was wobbly. Disappointed, I returned it. Still hoping to find a desk lamp similar to the one I had, I came across this one. Though more expensive, I could tell immediately upon opening the box that this one was such finer quality. It has a wide (approx 8.5 inches), sturdy metal base. Open to where I need it to be, the top of the lamp stands about 20 inches above my work area. The lamp itself is all metal and feels very \"substantial\" - that it is well-made and will last a long time. The lamp fits tightly into the metal base so there is no \"wobble.\" This is exactly what I was looking for. The only downside that some might find is that because the base and the lamp itself are larger than others, it might not fit easily on to a smaller desk. Though not an issue for me, you may want to take some measurements to make certain the area you are planning to put this has room for its wider base and higher neck. For me, this is perfect and I am very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars The clamp wasn't large enough for the thickness of my desk",
                "reviewText": "This is a lovely lamp, well made and with a touch of elegance with the coppery touches on brushed gray metal. But it's failure, for me, was that the clamp to attach it to the desk wasn't big enough to grasp the edge of the desk. It was off by 1/16\". To get it to fit the nut under the brace would have to have had a longer shank which joined the bracket base with the clamp. VERY disappointed. The solid base that also comes with it is huge, and would take up way too much space on the desktop. Looks way bigger in person than it did in the pictures. Still, it's a classy looking piece, just not practical for me. Sending it back.",
