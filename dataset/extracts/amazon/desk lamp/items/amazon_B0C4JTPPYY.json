If you don\u2019t need it super bright, it has other options to fit your needs! The top bends as well so it\u2019s very adjustable so once it\u2019s clipped it still can be moved around to get different lighting on areas you need it. I love it!",

It's larger than I imagined yet takes up zero space, adjustable, and has multiple light settings which is great depending on the time of day! The easy to use power button is sensitive which i prefer and i dont have to go under my desk to turn it on as its right on my desk!!! The lower price point was a win as well! Easy to install and use! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Great lamp, and very versatile. Seems to be just barely tall enough to go above my raised monitors (on monitor arms), so I wish it was a couple inches taller and height-adjustable (yes, you can bend it, but it's long). The brightness is high enough to be very useful and not blinding, as well as almost infinitely adjustable. In fact, with the three light color modes (cool white, warm white, and white) that can be adjusted individually and it will remember them even when it's off, as long as it stays plugged in.It was easy to put together (took about 1 minute, as everything just screws into each other and you just need to pull the cable through the middle piece until the lamp itself can be screwed into the top of it. You have the choice to plug this directly into a USB port, as I have or you can use the power adapter that came with it to plug it into the wall.It's a great product, especially for the price. I can see why this would be good for reading, writing or work where you need proper lighting. Yes, it's that bright, but not blinding. I love the adjustability, but wish it had a button that wasn't attached to the cord, as I would prefer to hide the cord. I also wish it could extend at least a few inches more, for my situation. However, I do highly recommend this lamp.",
