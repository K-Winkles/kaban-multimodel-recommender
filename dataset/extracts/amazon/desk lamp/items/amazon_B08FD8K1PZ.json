                "reviewText": "Pretty good light. I use it as a backlight in my office and for Zoom. Sturdier than another I bought. The arm articulates backwards past the vertical a bit, maybe to about 100-110 degrees of a circle or so.About three months in it started not staying on all the time. This got worse, until I had issues turning it on and then figured out it's the cheap USB cord they provide. Since these are a dime a dozen for nice ones on Amazon, it was an easy fit to grab one out of my drawer and now I've had no issues.I'd recommend this light. The footprint is a little big...about 7x4 inches but that's what makes it sturdy and it's just heavy enough not to get knocked around.I wish the light was a little brighter, but it's bright enough to most applications and I wouldn't consider it dim at all. It's just when I use it I usually have it up to the max.",

                "reviewText": "I love the look of this lamp. It\u2019s very sleek and minimal, but tall enough so you can reach around it so get other things on the nightstand. The brightness is also on par for what it\u2019s made for- a reading or desk lamp. It lights up the small area around the lamp, which is what was expected. You can even swivel the bottom toward you to face your book. If you swivel up the top part all the way up, the lamp is out of the way. I like the options for light hues, based on needs. I also love how you can do the smallest light level and fold up the lamp to use as a night light with barely any brightness. It also has a timer which is nice if you want to have it turn off at night automatically. One of my favorite things is the usb charging port so I can charge my phone without having to use an outlet.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this lamp because I was looking for a space-saving lamp for my cramped desk.Overall, I am pleased with the lamp. It came well-packaged and was easy to install. The light and dimming options are nice and very easy to use. Best of all, it hardly takes up any space. I like that it can twist and turn to the angle I need, and then I can fold it up when I don\u2019t need it to further save space. I have not tested the sleep mode.Drawbacks:The biggest issue for me is that the lamp doesn\u2019t save your previous lighting setting when you turn it on again. It defaults to a blindingly bright white light instead of the eye-saving, orangey, dim light I prefer it set at. Another issue is that the package included a usb cable, but not a wall plug-in. While this was not an issue for me, I could see this being an issue for others. The last issue is that the dimming options on the stand are faded and missing in one spot (see second pic).Overall, I would recommend this lamp. It accomplishes what I needed and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.",

You'll need to plug it into a computer or a spare USB power supply, like a wall phone charger plug. It wasn't clear in the product description that a plug wasn't included. The lamp itself is great - just make sure you have a plug.",

I like the variation in light colors and brightness - there are some times I prefer warm light and other tasks for which I prefer a cool white. I am able to adjust the angle and position of the lamp without moving the base, and I find the aesthetic of the lamp to be minimalist and pleasing. This lamp is perfect for the purposes for which I needed it.If I run into any problems or find any cons going forward, I will update this review accordingly.",

I am looking for a similar light that actually works, even if it us slightly mote expensive. It's not worth the savings.",
