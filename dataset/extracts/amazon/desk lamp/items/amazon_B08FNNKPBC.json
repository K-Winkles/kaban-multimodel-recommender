                "reviewText": "I went into this purchase after reading many of the reviews, so I was prepared to do alterations and all to see it fit for my use. To my relief no alterations were necessary to install the CLAMP base on the BLACK lamp. I did however cut two tiny pieces from my yoga mat to act as a grip between both sides of the clamp and my table top. Perfect! The reviews are correct on how \"tight\" the adjustable joints are tightened at arrival. You can still pull it, to your liking, with force. My guess is so that is stays secured and not bouncing all around the box during transport. Ah ha, I have Phillips screwdriver and a 7mm socket wrench! Using those tools gave me full freedom to adjust the arms the way I wanted them to move. It has fantastic movement for where and how far away you want the light to be *given it's dimensions*Be advised of the product's total extended height, cord length, plug type (*3 pronged), and on/off switch placement on the cord. I was, so in addition I purchased an Amazon basics, UL rated, 6ft long, 3 pronged extension cord for really cheap. It's perfect. The lamp doesn't come with the bulb you will use. Which is fine because it is not included. I really enjoy the bulb I bought for the lamp. It solves the complaint issues others had about the bulb sticking out passed the hood. I purchased a Satco 7&1/2 watt, medium base, S11 (height of bulb), in red. I can't tell you how happy I am with my lamp set up. I LOVE LAMP.",
