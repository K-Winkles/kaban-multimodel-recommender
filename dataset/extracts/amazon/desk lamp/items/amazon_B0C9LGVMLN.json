                "reviewText": "This is a great reading light. I love the modern look of it and it looks great on my nightstand. It also has useful easy settings. Once I turn it on, I can set it as a reading light with one button. If I want to make it a dim night light, I can do that with button settings. It even has a timer so that I can have it automatically turn off after 45 minutes. That is perfect if I fall asleep while reading, which I do all the time.This light is also versitile in that I can move all the parts to make the light show in the direction where I want it to light. It can be a bit bright on the highest setting, so it is nice to move the parts around so the light shines in a good spot.There is a pen holder that I originally thought was a phone holder. It has a plastic divider in the center, so it cannot hold a phone. It would have been nice if it didn't have the plastic divider so that I could choose to hold pens or my phone there.Overall, it is a very good light for reading at night.",

The lights do not rotate perpendicular to the length of the light, however, which would be really convenient. The lamp is lightweight, for whatever that's worth. There's a USB charging port at the base, which is convenient. The amount of light it produces isn't impressive, but it's enough to be useful. And you can change the color \"temperature\", to adjust it to your preferences for warm or cold looking light.",

                "reviewText": "I liked that it has adjustable arms so you can cover more area with light. It has adjustments for color temperature and brightness. It advertises a slider for brightness adjustment, but I found it easier to just tap at the brightness level you need. Brightness seems good, they advertise 750 lumens. I think that it is probably accurate as it seems brighter than a 500 lu worklight that I have. One problem that I had was It would fall over if I leaned the light too far from vertical. They say that it can be leaned forward but I found that the base did not have enough weight to support that. Once you leaned the light 15~20 degrees from vertical the lamp will just fall over.It also features a USB port for charging, but it is only a 10w charger so it's not too useful for charging a phone. Something low power like some earbuds or a headset will be fine but not a phone.It comes with it's own USB power adapter and cable.It would be 5 stars if it did not fall over, but I still like the light.",
