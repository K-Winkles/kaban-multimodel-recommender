                "reviewText": "I would not be as put off by the cheap plastic build quality if the lamp actually worked. My 3 YO daughter was excited to have the easy-on touch switch, which is also easy to locate in the dark because it has a tiny LED. However, the lamp quit after being on for two minutes and 2-3 on-off cycles of her learning the switch. I've tried other USB power adapters to no avail. Also, the clamp mount has no rubber or other material to keep it in place. It easily slides off of smooth/painted surfaces even when really tightened down. The base appears to be filled with cinder block or cement. I put it on a teak desk and coarse gray dust fell out and scratched the surface when I moved the base. This lamp set is total junk. I wouldn't bother with the return except for $20, it's really not acceptable. The manufacturer has serious quality assurance issues and needs to know it.",

                "reviewText": "Why's it so hard to find a decent LED desk lamp nowdays? I'm resigned to the fact that they stop working after a year or so - continually adjusting the position of the lamp wears the internal wires down til they break I suspect? So I order several cheap ones to have a replacement handy. So many of them have the trendy touch-activated thing which I HATE. Light turns on and off/dims every time I brush it or change the position. Never again! So I have to ignore all the lamps with that. I love a switch right on the lamp but they now all have them on the cords.Anyway, this lamp is decent I guess. It doesn't match what the reviews here say though. It's got a replaceable bulb and a standard cord (not USB as many reviews here mention). Brightness is OK for the size - could be brighter though, especially since I've had even smaller lamps that were plenty bright. The supplied bulb has a slight yellowish tone which could be good for ambient lighting but not ideal for close desktop work. The switch is on the cord, not on the lamp. Bah!The base is very light compared to even smaller lamps but it seems perfectly stable. I don't expect to have issues with that. One last thing: the instructions say to \"carefully\" insert the lamp into the base. Ha! Nope. You have to really push and shove that sucker, but it will go in eventually.I'd say for 19 bucks go ahead and buy it if you don't see something better. I loved my previous Newhouse lamp: DLST01-B. Perfect small size, bright, switch on the lamp not the cord. But they don't sell it anymore. I should have bought five of them.",

Makes it hard to use up close in front of the base. Otherwise a good, inexpensive lamp.",
