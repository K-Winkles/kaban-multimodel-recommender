                "reviewText": "I'd recently bought a different brand of this same style swing-arm/clamp desk lamp and was extremely peeved to discover the nuts used to tighten the lamp into the desired position did NOT tighten at all. They just spun like a Fidget Spinner! Both the arm joint and the lamp head could only hang loose. Totally useless! So I looked for a better brand and found this one. The dimensions are right, the color is right, the lamp works fine AND IMPORTANTLY the thing stays in the position I want. It moves smoothly and can be re-set to a new height or angle, and the nuts tighten as intended. Problem solved for an even better price than the one that didn't stay put. Globe Electric is the brand to avoid; Bostitch the one to buy.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a \"Damaged Package But Like-New\" version of this lamp for a slight discount. The lamp arrived a full day early and despite the battered package it was indeed like new, as promised. All the parts were there. No instructions were provided, but honestly, really? It's a lamp, guys! As advertised, an LED bulb was included.I had another version of this lamp still in service, that I ended up giving to my friend, Vinnie, a retired racing pigeon. That lamp now shines over his nest with a special UV lamp, and he seems very satisfied with the whole setup.I did away with the whole clamp thingy and mounted this new lamp's base directly to my well worn desk, using two screws diagonally in the mounting holes of the lamp's plastic base. I positioned new base to cover the holes from the previous base mounted there. There will be zero issues with this lamp's attachment to my desk! Done Deal!Next came the shade. I didn't care for the way the shade secured to the fixture housing. Any little bump and the shade falls down around the bulb. Annoying as hell; it would drive me buggy over the long haul! I fixed this by twisting the shade into place as intended, and then shooting two self-tapping screws into the \"dimples\" already stamped into the fixture housing. This secured the shade in place, and with all the silver hardware already on the lamp, the fix looks factory. Again, done deal!The included LED bulb is bright enough, but it has that blue-cast, which I hate. Not only is it ugly, but the blue spectrum of light is the least optimal for your vision. I replaced the bulb with an even brighter, warm-white LED, and all is right with my world.Tip: The switches on these things are cheap and they fail. But LED bulbs run hot at their bases and cool at their tips. So leave the switch on and just give the bulb a half turn, to turn the lamp on and off! Don't crank it down too tight when turning it on. Don't crank it back too little when turning it off. A full half turn for on, and a full half turn for off. No switch failures--ever. Done Deal!The lamp is cheaply made, that's just a fact. But the build is adequate for my use, and it's not ugly. It's worst bugaboos can be easily fixed or worked around. And it is inexpensive. And right now there's not a whole lot else out there. Hell, I just ordered another one!UPDATE: The second \"Like-New Repackaged\" Lamp (at a slight discount) arrived on time, and did not disappoint, as its condition was ostensibly flawless. The shade on this particular lamp secured tightly enough that no extra measures were necessary. The lamp's base fit the previous lamp's mount well enough, so I was home-free on that account too. The LED bulb that was supposed to be included was missing, but since the supplied bulb has that ugly blue-shifted light, I would've replaced it anyway, so I did not complain. Again, these are not commercial-grade lamps, and are best suited for light duty around the home, though as I type this, Vinnie continues to enjoy his! I'll try to attach a pic, later!RayB",

                "reviewText": "The lamp is perfect for my needs--well-made, sturdy, somewhat old school (which is what I wanted), a basic tried and true design, and they even included a light bulb, fancy that! The only problem was that the box it came in somehow got damaged and appeared to have been opened and closed with tape. Not pretty. When I inspected the lamp, I noticed the \"flawlessly\" painted metal shade had a half-inch scratch. I kept the attractive, affordable lamp since the small defect was on the back, and I'd rarely see it. The instructions documents looked like they had been shoved in the box haphazardly. Still, I'm OK with the product. It looks fine clamped to my desk.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an adjustable light for the outside bar-b-que. I wasn't happy with the lights currently listed for sale, not bright enough and didn'tlike the mounts and they just look cheap. So I bought this desk light for the Bar-b-que. I also bought a brighter LED bulb. I was lucky because of the design of our bar-b-qur. On a side shelf there are slots. I took off the nut and clamp then slid the threaded shaft through the slot. Installed the clamp and nut on the threaded shaft and hand tightened the base onto the grill shelf. I know this lamp isn't designed for outside use. When it fails I'll fix it. It's a 20$ light with easy-to-use components and is easily repaired or replaced. We use our Bar-b-que alot. Our outdoor lights do not shine sufficiently into the grill after sunset. Eliminating or improving the switch on the lamp to an out door rated switch turns this lamp into a great light for my needs.Durability: I'm not expecting more then two years before the light fails. It's not designed to be used like this and I understand that. But that being said, I'm good at fixing things and its a lamp not rocket science. As long as the main components continue to work. I'll be happy.",

This is a desk lamp, must have been around for at least the last 50 years yet Bostitch cannot send it with a mounting clamp that holds fast, or a lamp shade that stays put. The clamp pulls off every single time I attempt to adjust the lamp\u2019s position. The clamp is so cheap and poorly made of cheap plastic without an anti-slip pad or teeth to bite, that it slides right off the surface it is clamped onto. When I touch the lamp to make an adjustment, the lamp shade falls off and hangs on the light bulb. We can do better, I don\u2019t trust the brand any longer. Pay half as much and take your chances with the no name brands.",
