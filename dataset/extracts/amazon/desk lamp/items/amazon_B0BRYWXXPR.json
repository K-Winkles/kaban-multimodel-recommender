This is far too dim. Everything I do just feels back-lit from this light, making it even harder to see what I'm doing. The light does not have enough reach. In order for this to be useful for the described kind of use, you would need to work DIRECTLY underneath this lamp, but it is far too small to accomplish that.All of that said, it seems to be well built. The movement between the two sides is smooth and it operates nicely. I wish it was larger and brighter. If you just need an ambient light on a small surface, this is probably a good light for you.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a clean, modern desk light that was good for both task lighting and to use as a light for videoconferencing (like a keylight). Logitech makes a desk light for that, but it seemed a bit expensive. I saw this light, with its highly adjustable arm, and it seemed like a great alternative. I love that the light source splits down the middle, so you can spread the arms apart up to 180 degrees. This, coupled with the ability to adjust both the brightness and color of the light, make it a great option for improving your image on video calls. I like the light quality.It is well-made, and it looks nice. I wish it was a little less \"plasticky,\" but given the price-point, I think the quality is very good. It works well for what I wanted, so what more can you ask for. Overall, this is a really well-designed, functional and versatile desk lamp/key light. A great, affordable option.",
