From the moment I received them, I was impressed by the exquisite craftsmanship evident in the handmade carved patterns adorning the ceramic bodies. Each detail tells a story of skilled artistry, adding a touch of rustic charm to my modern decor.The 25-inch height of these lamps is just perfect for creating ambient lighting that enhances the ambiance of any mealtime gathering. The eye-caring white linen shades diffuse the light beautifully, casting a soft and inviting glow across the room. Whether it's a casual family dinner or a more formal occasion, these lamps provide just the right amount of illumination, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.One of the things I appreciate most about these lamps is their versatility. The simple rotary switch makes them easy to turn on and off, while the compatibility with E26 bulbs allows me to customize the lighting to suit my preferences. Whether I want to create a cozy, intimate setting or brighten up the room for a lively dinner party, these lamps deliver every time. Not only are these lamps stylish and functional, but they also serve as conversation pieces, drawing compliments from guests every time they visit. The combination of the rustic farmhouse aesthetic and modern design elements makes them a standout feature in my dining area, elevating the overall look and feel of the space.",

                "reviewText": "These are some very lovely lamps!!The vibe feels more of a Fall to me from these lamps. But they can be used with any decor, really!They are White ceramic bases with beige Fir stems and beige bursts fluttering along the base.The cloth lampshade (this one is White) can easily be changed out for another color, pattern, or easily taken off to clean- as it is clipped on and Velcro'd down!This does hold a standard bulb, so no running around looking for that odd or random bulb to replace a burnt out one.These are heavy! As mentioned prior; the base is ceramic!The plug is on a decently long cord.The light is lovely, especially with this shape shade!The overall aesthetic is perfect for any room decor as the colors are pretty general.The lamps are very easy to finish putting together!And the shades are very easy to clean! All you have to do is open out the velcro side and unclip it from the two wire frames!Get a damp cloth and clean the surface off. Blot it to dry, Lay it out after blotting it, or blot it and then use the hair dryer on the shade before putting it back on the lamp shade frame!These are very lovely lamps!And the asking price is pretty much what I would expect of this quality and item!These are not tiny rechargeable lamps. These are beautiful classic and stylish lamps!I highly Recommend these lamps!They're well worth it!And everyone could use a sturdy pair of lamps!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Much larger than the photos make them appear",
                "reviewText": "I originally ordered these lights to go in my bedroom to have some supplemental lighting. However, they were far too large to put on a bookcase or in the other space that I wanted them to go. In lieu of placing them in my bedroom, I decided to replace our current living room lamps with these. Although it was a bummer that I couldn\u2019t fit them in the space that I wanted, they are very well made and I am hopeful that I can find a smaller version of these or a smaller lamp made by the same manufacturer to put in my room. There are a couple things that make these far superior to other lamps that I\u2019ve ordered.The packaging is top notch. All other lamps that I have ordered have had the shades rolled up tightly with a small piece of circular styrofoam in the middle. This creates a major defect when they are unpackaged and you end up with a lot of deformities in the shades that cannot be fixed. The lampshades for these lamps are placed on the outside of the packaging for the main components and are loosely wrapped so that no parts of the shades are in contact with the other. It may not sound like a big deal, but it really is considering that this prevents the shades from being curled up and developing irreversible bumps in them that really detract from the look of the lamp.The lamps come 90% assembled with you only needing to screw in the top socket (make sure to remove the black protector ring) and place the mount for the lampshade. They are designed with the lampshade mount that kind of resembles a bridge. This makes it much easier to just plug and play with your lightbulbs and deletes the step of having to remove the lampshade to replace lightbulbs. So many lamps have this poor design feature that doesn\u2019t make it exactly convenient so I really appreciate that. The light has a dial that you only need to turn once to turn the lamp on/off. In my experience, dials have needed to have a double twist so it\u2019s nice that this only needs one.The pattern of the leaves on the pure white is also absolutely stunning and beautiful. It looks like something you\u2019d find at stores like crate and barrel but at a fraction of the price. It is also very hardy and has some weight to it so I\u2019m not worried about it falling over from a misplaced breath.Because the shade is white, you get an ample amount of light from it. We have smart bulbs that are equivalent to a 60w bulb so they don\u2019t get AS bright as I\u2019d like but this shade really helps with dispersing light into the room to help alleviate some of that dimness.Really, the only bad thing that I can say about this lamp is that you can see the inners of the tops and bottoms of the lampshades (see photos). They are thicker on the ends and it\u2019s almost like you can see glue or something within when the light is on. However, that doesn\u2019t change my opinion about the quality, aesthetic, or functionality of the light so it still gets a full five stars from me.",
