                "reviewText": "I enjoy building Lego and completing gem art kits and it can be hard to see what I\u2019m doing without good lighting. This desk lamp is perfect and for a great price. The adjustable arm allows me to angle it for the best lighting, the clamp holds strong and is easy to move around, and the different colour settings and brightness are a great feature too! I actually bought a second one a few days after my first purchase to give to a friend who is an artist and they loved it too! Overall, 10/10, 100% recommend.",

                "reviewText": "J'ai rachet\u00e9 cette lampe tellement j'avais appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re. Elle \u00e9claire tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s bien, je l'ai mise au chevet du lit de ma fille pour qu'elle lise au lit en \u00e9tant bien \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Le syst\u00e8me de serrage pour l'accrocher est tr\u00e8s bien, tr\u00e8s pratique avec le petit levier qui bascule d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre. Le fait de pouvoir baisser l'intensit\u00e9 lumineuse et d'avoir trois tonalit\u00e9s (chaude, froide, blanche) sont tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciables aussi et fonctionnent bien. Enfin, la tige pliable permet de la mettre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans la position souhait\u00e9e.Seuls b\u00e9mols : 1) le fait que la lampe soit livr\u00e9e seulement avec une prise USB, il faut ajouter un adaptateur secteur mais bon, comme son prix est raisonnable, c'est OK. 2) le c\u00e2ble pourrait \u00eatre plus long et 3) la lampe est assez \u00e9blouissante mais c'est la cons\u00e9quence de sa grande luminosit\u00e9 et de son design tr\u00e8s simple (pas d'abat jour!),, on ne peut pas tout avoir.Donc au total un super produit tr\u00e8s efficace et au design \u00e9l\u00e9gant et pratique.",
