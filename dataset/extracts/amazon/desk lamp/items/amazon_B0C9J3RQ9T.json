I especially love it because it\u2019s so easy to adjust the position of it, for example if you paint or draw things and need a lot of light. On functionality part-5/5 stars! The only negative thing I would say is that charging doesn\u2019t work very well. I have original mag face phone cover but it doesn\u2019t work with this lamp, which is weird. Without a case it\u2019s also not working 4/5 times! I have to adjust my phone with such a precision that it\u2019s just not worth it. 1mm off? It won\u2019t work. So don\u2019t get it for charging. But definitely super nice lamp for lighting and functionality of it for that purpose is awesome!",

It is a good size in which you are able to use a good number of photos/mementos to create whatever memory you wish to treasure.I used double sided tape to secure my photos on the linen backing and the included pins to hang some extra keepsakes - I would note that these will not take much more weight than one of the small glass bottles (that I had also purchased from Amazon https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00PVFH0H0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 .)The lights are a warm yellow/orange and create a cosy feeling in the room.Mine work perfectly, and switch off after 6 hours. They also come on at the same time each day - a feature which I have to admit I had not realised was present - which is lovely and saves you having to fiddle with the shadow box each evening to put the lights on.It uses 3 AAA batteries; I cannot yet say how long they last as I\u2019ve only just started using the lights.I paid \u00a326.99 which I feel was a very good price for the quality and the price has since come down which is even better value.As I said, I was so pleased with it I bought a second one.",

This was a little project for a friend, flowers and photos (taken off photos for privacy reasons) we\u2019re added I stained the background with coffee. Overall it\u2019s very sturdy. The back comes off like a picture frame and the Magnet on the front closer was strong. It\u2019s very rustic in black matte staining on the frame. The size was perfect for a small arrangement but nothing to thick as it will squash it down.Fast delivery and well packaged. Very Happy.",
