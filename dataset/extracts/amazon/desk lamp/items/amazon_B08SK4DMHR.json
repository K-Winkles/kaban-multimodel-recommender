                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a commercial lamp I purchased from my company years ago that finally died. I did not expect to get one near that quality at this price point, but was pleasantly surprised when I took this lamp out of the box. It's a well made lamp with a nice finish. The controls are very simple and intuitive to use too.I had toyed with the idea of getting a clamp on light to prevent it from tipping and making it easier to bend into position, but most of those have the switches on the lamp head or cord which I did not want. That said the base is a lot lighter than my last light, but it is substantial enough that you can maneuver the light into position without the base moving too much. It also has a nice anti-slip protective padding underneath which help protect the surface of the table it's on and keep the base from moving around too.I would have preferred the neck to be a tad longer although it is long enough to direct light over my chair where I sit to read. I also like the three light settings. I use the warmest setting for when I just want a little mood lighting and one of the brighter settings when I am reading or working on something in my chair. The push button switch/dial knob makes it very easy to turn on and off and adjust the brightness - even with my big hands. I did not really care about the USB port but it's a nice feature to have. There is also an ambient light sensing feature I did not need or use yet, but it might be good for some people.All and all I am very happy with this light. It's not the quality of the $200 light I had previously, but it is easily worth the money I paid so I am very happy with the purchase and can recommend this lamp without hesitation.",

All good as a lamp. The USB charger pass through? Not so great. When you plug in a phone to charge, the light visibly dims. My phone also said it was going to take over 3 hours to go from 68% charge to full. Ha! Regular charger would do that in a few minutes. So, if you want a good cost more than adequate desk lamp, this is a good deal. But don't think you're getting a decent charger rolled in too.",

I really liked that yet wanted something more sophisticated for my home office desk. Often at the home office, the overhead light is not enough or too little so I needed something closer to my desk workspace. This desk lamp is the perfect size and offers more options than I need for now but happy to have them in case my needs or preferences change. Also, I plugged my FitBit charger into the USB port which opened up one of the ones on my laptop for other uses \"on the fly\". I recommend this lamp. Can't say enough good things about it. Jamie",
