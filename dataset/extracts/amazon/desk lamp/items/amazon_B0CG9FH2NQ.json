                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My son loves this light !!",
                "reviewText": "I bought this light for my son to use over his desk which has three large monitors. He's at his desk about 90% of the time he is awake and often works from home too so it gets a lot of use. Prior to this light he was using one I got from my old job when they had a sale after they downsized the space. I bought three of them and they were high end commercial lights with a long hinged flexible arm, weighted base and a single LED light. Over time each one failed so when he had tape on the last one to keep it on, I decided to get him a new one for Xmas. When I mentioned it too him he was pretty adamant he wanted one similar, specifically with a single spot type light, and did not care what it cost...thanks son !!However, when I started searching for a replacement I had a hard time finding one with an arm long enough to reach over his monitor setup, which sits about 29\" above the table top, with a single spot type LED. Plus, as I mentioned, he has three monitors so I kept thinking having one that could cover more area on the desk just made sense. The last thing I wanted was one that clamped to the desk, versus a weighted base, so as not to add to the already cluttered and dusty mess he calls his 'work space.\" Which btw, is why I did not provide a picture of the light in use.In the end the KableRika desk lamp has all the features I wanted in a light plus it is very well made. I have other lights that are similar in design but they are not nearly the level of quality as this light. It's a very sturdy light starting with the clamping system, and the arms which are made from very solid material, too the two adjustable light bars. The light is very easy to get into position and is more than tall enough to reach over the monitors too. My son has commented more than once how easy it is to adjust so he can change the light level and intensity to suit his needs or mood. He also likes they way the light spread out to cover more space than his old one. Looks like father knew best on that one too !!One thing I appreciate it how easy it is to shut off. He often leaves it on, another pet peeve of mine, so being able to easily reach over and shut it off with a simple light press in the general area of the switch is very convenient. The controls are very easy to operate and require only very light pressure so the light head does not move or shift in any way when you make adjustments. Having all the necessary control on the light versus the base is another thing that works out real well for my son's setup. It might not for you so that is one thing to take into consideration when choosing a light.My son's girlfriend also bought him a desk light for Xmas so I thought at first this one would either not get out of the box or he would prefer the one she bought him....just because. But once he had it setup on his desk even his girlfriend acknowledged it was a perfect light for his setup. Oh and him being able to have it setup in like five minutes says all I need to say about how easy it is to setup. My son inherited a lot of things from his pops, but mechanical ability is definitely not one of them.Desk lamps are not \"one size fits all\", it is really based on your setup and needs. When it's all said and done the KableRika Desk Lamp is an excellent light with a lot of features. There are less expensive desk lamps for sure...I have one, but if you are looking for a desk light and have a similar configuration, the KableRika Desk Lamp will serve you well. It's a quality light at a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "This KableRika desk lamp was easy to assemble, except for crawling around under the desk, and extends nicely above my computer monitors. The wide light bar is a real plus. It was simple to adjust so that it lights all of the desk without glaring right in my eye. The warmer color temperature options have good, natural-looking color rendition. The warmest color choice was a good match for the light from the Cree warm white bulb in a nearby floor lamp, though light one step \"colder\" works better for me when reading and working on the computer. It was easy to adjust the brightness to my taste.The only minus is that the auto-dimming mode sometimes \"hunts\" between two levels of brightness. However, the wide range of adjustability this lamp offers, both in the quality of light and where the light is directed, make the KableRika lamp a real winner.",

I am disappointed to find out that it is not nearly as flexible as the other model. The joints do not all swivel which limits the range of motion by a lot.Overall still a useful work lamp and it does match the styling of the other lamp, but I would much prefer if the joints all moved the same on each lamp.",

The base is compact but but weighty and steady, and the flexible upright makes for easy positioning . Then, the colour and intensity of the light can be adjusted to suit the ambient conditions at the touch of buttons. Assuming that the LEDs last, I cannot fault this lamp. The packaging provided as much protection as possible during delivery. I say thank you to the suppliers.",
