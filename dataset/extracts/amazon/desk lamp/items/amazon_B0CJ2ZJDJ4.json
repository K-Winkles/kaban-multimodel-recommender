This light was easily mounted on the table and added to the side where I read. Now I can relax with a better light on my Kindle. Or what ever else I am reading. The colour changing is neat, but I haven't decided on the colour I like the best. But it is interesting to be able to test out other light colours for eye comfort and readability. The little hand control is good too. Wish it worked with Alexa but then a smart switch will make that happen.",
