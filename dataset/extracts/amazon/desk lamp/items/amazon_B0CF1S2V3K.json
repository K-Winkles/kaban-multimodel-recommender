It has three levels of brightness and 3 different types of color I do find two of the colors useful so far and of course the different brightness is great. I can use this most the day without having to re charge it. But even then it charges quickly and I use it again. It came with a rather short cord but it uses a micro USB so I just purchased a 10ft cord and charge it while on my stand or on my Q-snap. This light will also charge while in use, however my light until it gets a little bit of a charge in it will flicker slightly, it doesn't bother me but I can see where it could be rather annoying.",

Only minor complaint is the neck doesnt always stay where I want it to but I adjust the clip and I'm fine with it. I would buy many times over!",

When you reduce the brightness, it's reduced not by reducing the constant voltage, but via the frequency. This means that this light actually flickers at lower brightness which you cannot really see unless you move the light quickly from one direction to another. This obviously will cause some headaches and eye strain!",
