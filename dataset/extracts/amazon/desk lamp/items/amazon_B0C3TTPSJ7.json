When I put it next to monitor, the arms will fight for space with the monitors.The ON/OFF button is very sensitive and there is no hepatic impact upon touching it. I could easily put my finger in the wrong area, which eventually adjusted the brightness or \"reading-mode\" on the unit.Lastly, it does not come with the AC adaptor. The unit only comes with the regular USB-A to USB-C cable. It is not very long, so you may need to replace the cable or have a USB-A hub on your desk to plug it.Bottom line is if you are looking for quick and affordable light for your desk, this unit is working as it should. There is nothing fancy since it is made of plastics and the arm height / length are not adjustable.",

Pencil cup is dumb. Wireless charger in same place would have been cool. 38 LEDs- 19 on each side. Light color selection is nice feature- ranges from warm white to cool white. Includes 45-minute sleep timer and a \"reading\" selection that changes the color to something like \"night light\" for Windows. Draws a bit of power with phone charging, so use a 2 amp power block or larger if not powering from your computer's USB.",
