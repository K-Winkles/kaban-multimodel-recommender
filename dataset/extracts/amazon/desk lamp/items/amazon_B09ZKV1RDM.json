It is not expensive though and seems portable.",

The product is white and so is the power switch. Unless the lighting is just right you can't see the power switch. Check out the photos attached to this review. It was 2 days before I found that there was a power switch. The power switch should be a different color than the base of the product.VERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDI would give you zero Stars if that's possible but it's not so you get one star. And it's much smaller than it looks and it's pictures. Seems to me like sort of deceptive advertising although it's on me because I didn't look for the measurements but a picture of being worth a thousand words your pictures worth 10 words.VERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDThe cord is not long enough to reach from the wall plug to a practical position on the desk. There is no weight to the base so it doesn't stay flat on the desk. Twist in the cord actually reposition the light.VERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDThe weight of the base is so light that it oftentimes just tips over because the post and the lamp are heavier than the base itself. This is very poorly engineered without much thought behind it.VERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDVERY DISAPPOINTEDI would give you zero Stars if that's possible but it's not so you get one star.
