                "reviewText": "This is a terrifically great lamp in every respect. It is well designed with a ton of useful features. It looks great and it is relatively inexpensive for a lamp of this type.It has 4 lighting modes (Kelvin temperature) with each mode having 5 steps of brightness. This makes it really versatile. I use the warmer light mode for most things but for fine, detailed work, I use the cooler, whiter light turned on high. And it can be put onto the more yellow light mode and turn the brightness down and it can create mood light.The LED lights are recessed on the light bar for indirect lighting. The light bar and the vertical post are articulated so the angle and coverage of the light is easily adjusted. Plus, the light bar/vertical post pivots on the base for additional directional adjustment. The square, large, flat base provides enough stability that there is no danger of the lamp tipping over even when extended to its farthest reach.It also has a 1.0 amp USB charger so you can charge smartphones and other small portable, electronic devices. It's L.E.D. so it runs extremely cool and is totally silent in operation. It's black plastic construction is very contemporary and good looking.It also had a timer mode - when activated, it will shut off after one hour of operation. The charger works with the lamp on or off.It's really nicely designed, works well, looks great and is inexpensive!What's not to like???Jim",

Customer service is great\u2014I had a problem with it not charging my phone, so I reached out to them. They were very helpful and immediately sent me a new lamp, which works like a charm. One of the few that I found that has touch control, dims, movable, and stand-up phone charger. I have it on my nightstand and it\u2019s perfect. Can\u2019t go wrong with this one!",

                "reviewText": "Everything works as advertised. Yes, the plastic is thin and cheap feeling. The arm pops into the vertical position, locking it upright, and the lock feels like it will break if the motion is repeated too often. But aside from that, I mean what do you want for $25? it works! The LED is bright enough to light up the corner of my large desk, the color temp is achieved by mixing brightness of two white strips with a yellow strip and that works fine. The phone charger is a very cheap plastic and you just lift it up (grabbing it is a little difficult) and put it in the stand, it is not on a hinge. But it works on my iPhone 13, just don't expect a magnet as there isn't one. There is also a USB-A port on the right side of the arm where I plugged in my watch charger. I stuck the watch stand in front of the arm so I can charge both phone and watch, works very well and charges reasonably quickly. I like it quite a bit, just wish the plastic was thicker/sturdier. Since it's a desk lamp it won't be moved around at all aside from angling the light once in a while.",

It\u2019s on my desk and is used for at least 8 hrs each day.]Rooster here...scored this baby for my desk because the old lamp/lampshadeA. Took up way too much roomB. Wasn't quasi-futuristic enough, andC. I needed to free up some desk space to hold top-secret documents, motorcycle parts, crochet materials or whatever.Anyway...I invested two whole hours of my life shopping for a desk lamp on Amazon. Then I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger on this little model. I may have lost two nights sleep waiting for this to arrive...\"Would I get my $14 worth?\" I fretted.Build is solid and the design is quasi-futuristic enough (at least $21 worth of value here in build/design alone).I appreciate the various lighting settings, allowing me to dial in just the right ambience in my executive office suite (aka, our spare bedroom).The \"warm\" settings are ROCK SOLID for paper & computer work. The brighter settings are super-helpful for when I'm working on guitars, refurbishing priceless oil paintings by the Old Masters or building emotionally-charged dinosaur battle dioramas.(You do what you like & I'll do what I like, OK?)Highly recommend this, it saved me having to fight off the ill-tempered hordes of holiday shoppers at local retailers and was Wallet-Friendly, always a plus.",

Surely it should be standard practice when exporting goods to ensure that they're capable of being used \"out of the box\" in the country to which they are sent!
