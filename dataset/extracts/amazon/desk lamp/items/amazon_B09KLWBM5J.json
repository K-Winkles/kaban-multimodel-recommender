This lamp lights up the corner in a very unobtrusive way. You can't even see it in my photo but I have it pointing toward the walls to provide ambient light. It comes with an inline switch for on/off, warm and cool light. I prefer the cool, white light, but there's also a setting for a mix of both. Now, if I can just find the timer I bought for the power strip I have it plugged into, I'll be totally set because I can't reach the switch. I just leave it on for now; since it's LED I'm not worried about it.",

                "reviewText": "The lamp works perfectly well; it has three lighting mode (white, warm, and soft white) and then you have the option to dim it from low light to bright light. I noticed people complaining about how you can\u2019t adjust the dimness or that it\u2019s too bright, and frankly,that seems to be user error because it dims just fine. You need to hold your finger on the power button, not pressing it, holding it. It will dim the lighting to dark and you can lift your finger and hold it again to get it brighter.The lamp is very sleek and very clean, and fits the aesthetic I was aiming for. I think people need to read the manual in order to place such criticism. I do agree that it would be nice if it came with a remote or that the cord wasn\u2019t placed where it is, because I like having the lamp face the wall for an ambient feeling and the cord placement is an eyesore.",

Took off one star because I bought it as a bedside lamp but really more suited to living areas of the house. Has three settings bright (really bright) natural and cool. All settings work well and the light on all three settings provides enough to see clearly. My only issue is that the light is a bit bright for the bedroom for me. I prefer a much more muted light source for the bedroom. That being said it is a really good product and I recommend",

I needed a night light that did not shine any light directly into the room since I watch TV there and mirrors are on all walls. This lamp is a perfect indirect light and gives off a very bright light if desired. The brightness is adjustable but not too great a range. The control is on the cord and its location is a little annoying for me, but then it also makes the placement of the lamp versatile. I am very happy with this purchase.",
