                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dott Arts LED Desk Lamp (Black/3 Level Dimmable)",
                "reviewText": "I bought this lamp to illuminate my turntable to make it easier to see any dust specks while brushing my records. This thing is perfect for the job, being very well made and perfectly stable. It has a solid feel and there is no looseness in the hinges, remaining however you situate it. Turning it on and changing the brightness is elegant and pleasing with a light touch of the power symbol, and the three levels are just right. The thin base makes it easy to slide it under the turntable to situate it as needed, and once done the light can be folded down and the lamp slid out of the way. When not in use it is unobtrusive and takes up very little room. The only downside I can think of is the cord, being a USB on one end but a pin type that goes into the lamp. If you need something longer you will need a USB male to USB female extension to get more reach, but I doubt if this will be a problem for most people. All in all I am extremely pleased with this lamp and especially for the low price. I hope it lasts for many years and at this point I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Like the size, both opened and folded. Is a good height for working many tasks, well below eye level on a table or counter, but still plenty of room under to work with hands.Strip light lateral arm folds flat against vertical mast, and mast folds down fully 90 degrees to a flat, horizontal position.The problem with this ability, is in the fact that the on-off button on base is not recessed, thus the slightly convex shape of the arm & mast turns on the light when folded all the way down. Since lights are folded flat against mast, if there is any daylight or other significant light around it, is hard to see that the light is on. Once flat, every time folded mast and arm are bumped it will turn light off or on.Wish it was a little brighter, but overall a gereat little task light for the price.",
