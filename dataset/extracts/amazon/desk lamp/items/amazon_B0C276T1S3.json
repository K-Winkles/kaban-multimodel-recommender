                "reviewTitle": "Quality, powerful desk light",
                "reviewText": "This is a powerful light. It uses 10W maximum - most LED desk lights are 4W.It comes well packed and complete but folded up, so there is no self-assembly required. It has a very heavy metal base about the size of a credit card and three inches deep with a plastic upright; the hinged light contains 24 white and 24 yellowish LEDs and is also plastic with a plastic diffuser. (Metal would get extremely hot; even the plastic gets hot with the LEDs all on). The light may be swivelled to any angle between straight up and straight down, folded into the upright.The base has USB-A and USB-C charging sockets on the top. I wish this was done more; I am arthritic and being able to press down to push in a cable, without having to hold the base at the same time or fiddle around at the back, is a big help. Both inserting and removing USB cables, and swivelling the light, can be done with one hand because the base is so heavy.Everything is controlled from a silver dial (plastic, although it looks like metal) next to the USB sockets.Because of the high wattage the light ranges from dim to shatteringly bright, leaving a visual afterimage if the LEDs are visible. A short press on the dial turns the light on; a second short press switches between all white LEDs on, all yellowish LEDs on, and an intermediate warmth where all LEDs are on; a long press turns the light off. Turning the dial changes the brightness in small steps. When the light is switched off, the set warmth and brightness are preserved.This light replaced a twelve-year-old one which cost about five times as much with a fixed warmth setting and two intensities - and the light it gave out was clearly inferior in quality. Things improve!The only issue is that the adapter and lead are black, when the rest of the light is white, and look a bit cheap. However, there is a standard barrel connector on the metal base and the adapter and lead could be replaced easily if required.Overall, an excellent light. It is probably too bright for the bedside, but is ideal for desk use or even to light up a reasonable-sized room at its highest intensity. If I could give 4.5 stars I would as the mismatched adapter and lead are an unfortunate slip.",

                "reviewText": "Questa lampada \u00e8 disegnata molto bene e risulta perfetta per un ambiente arredato in stile moderno.L'illuminazione \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che soddisfacente ed efficace sia per attivit\u00e0 di lettura/scrittura sia come supporto ad un pc nelle ore notturne.Possiede tre livelli di calore della luce (freddo/caldo/naturale) con circa una decina di livelli di intensit\u00e0 per ognuna delle tonalit\u00e0; devo dire che ogni livello risulta piuttosto interessante e non \u00e8 semplice scegliere quale dei tre sia il migliore. La presa usb-C pu\u00f2 essere comoda in alcune occasioni, anche se usandola si perde un po' il senso di pulizia estetica che possiede questo elemento.Nota di miglioramento: la lampada possiede soltanto un asse di rotazione, ovvero quello che permette di scegliere l'inclinamento del braccio a led, mentre non \u00e8 possibile ruotare o inclinare in alcun altro senso, perdendo cos\u00ec in flessibilit\u00e0 d'uso.",
