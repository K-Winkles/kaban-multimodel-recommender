                "reviewText": "It is not the cheapest desk lamp you will find on Amazon but it fixes all the problems I had with the cheaper options. The neck is long so the light is coming from ABOVE and not the FRONT so the light source is not in your eyes. It has all the light levels from 3000k to 6000k. It packs more than enough punch on the brightness as well. The previous models I try only meet the minimum requirement, this one goes beyond, so I don't use the brightest setting. Also it comes with a remote control which is very handy. If you pay attention to the lower price model their control is stuck to the power cable, that is very inconvenient. This one has control on top of the lamp, which is actually not the best design but it comes with a remote so that solves all problem for me. I would recommend everyone to get this model, and it is actually the lowest price model that satisfy all my feature requirement.",

The only thing I do not like is the on-unit controls-very sensitive and it seems not to control all of the features of this light. The remote is easy to use and many feature easily accessed.",

Goose neck and clamp felt strong and sturdy. Head of the light shakes a bit when you shake the table, but not a deal breaker. The remote is convenient for selecting different light modes. Controls are super touch sensitive though. I accidently turned the light on/off a few time while trying to adjust it's position. Overall, it's a great product.",
