Let's check out this one by Infiway.Features that work for me:Standard AC power plug that I prefer over an USB cable and a power adapter/block.5 light color settings, 5 brightness settings (highest setting is very bright), night light, and 1hr. timer.Adjustable, rotatable, tiltable light arms to position the LED where user needs it.Auto memorizes/retains last light color and brightness settings.Built in digital alarm clock (large, visible digits) with month, date, day, and temp. gauge in \u00b0F or \u00b0C.Coin battery CR2023 backups the time, date, and alarm settings.Base of light functions as power strip with 2 AC outlets, and 2 USB-A power/charging ports.Looks and works well on my study's desktop. Could also function as a bedside reading light with alarm clock and nightlight.Average quality materials and manufacturing.Slight miscues:No year or seconds shown in clock.Alarm clock isn't dimmable and is constantly on.Nightlight color and brightness not adjustable.Larger base/power strip takes up more room on my desktop.",

This was intended to replace a similar bedside lamp that was a little bit larger. This thing is impossible to figure out unless you keep the directions pasted on the wall behind the darn thing. There are so many settings and so many complications it's virtually impossible to remember so you're gonna have to always keep the document next to your bed. Once you get all of the extra nonsense turned off (a clock an alarm a nightlight oh my gosh -- all of it wholly unnecessary) because it's blinding you in the middle of the night next to your bed, I guess it's better than pitch black darkness . But I wouldn't buy it again. It just doesn't project enough light to be worth the money . And all its little digital widgets are worthless and impossible to figure out.",

I like the extra outlets on the base 115v and USB.The trouble is with the lamp arm to upright friction joint. There isn't enough friction to hold the lamp horizontal, and it keeps falling down. There's no adjustment to increase the friction/bind. I cut two pieces off a wide rubber band and stretched them into the gap of the hinge point between the upright and the lamp head. Currently this is working, but i don't know for how long?",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Adjustable, multiple lighting options, easy setup",
                "reviewText": "Wow! This lamp is a one stop shop lamp. I needed a desk lamp for book reading at night because I don't like using my bedroom ceiling light because it's too dull. I placed it on my small bedside table. This location makes it convenient to use the lamp no matter the time of day. I like the five color and brightness options for the light. Sometimes my eyes are more sensitive to lights than other times so having the option to change the color or brightness really helped adjust my eyes for reading. I do wear reading glasses and it has been much easier and less straining on my eyes to see the words on the pages better and clearer using this desk lamp.I used an outlet on the other side of my room for my charging cables. Now, I have them plugged into the lamp and they are in hands reach and not across the room.I also had a small alarm clock on my dresser that I would use in addition to my cell phone alarm. Now, I no longer need that alarm clock because there is one built into the table lamp and it also displays the time, temperature and date (unlike the alarm clock I had).My dislike is the nightlight. When turned on, it's a dark amber color and its located on the top arm of the lamp. Its very small. Due to where its located, its color, and size, it doesn't reflect as a nightlight. It's too dull. I think the LED screen produces more light turned on than the nightlight itself.I like that it was easy to setup the lamp physically and digitally. The lamp has no assembly. I love that it has multiple arm rotations (up, down, right, left, swivel) to get the best lighting you need. There is an instruction video on the advertisement page for this product that I watched and it was helpful for setting the time and date. It took me about 10 minutes to setup up the LED display.The switch types are touch sensitive on the base and on the back of the arm. It enhances the modernized look of the lamp.I wish it was offered in other colors besides a standard black so customers could choose a color.If I want to move this lamp somewhere else in my house or take it with me when traveling, it's lightweight, slender and foldable. I use this lamp every day because of its various functionalities. I am very pleased with this product and it would make a great gift too.",
