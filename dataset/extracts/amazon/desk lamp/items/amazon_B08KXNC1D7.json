I guess I didn't read all the features when I first ordered it but when I discovered the three different types of lighting it provides I got really excited. I also like the ease at which it can be moved from one location to another and the variety of positions available with the maneuverable arm. To me it's ultra-modern and looks really great in the den of my new house.",

Very disappointed it did not last very long.",

I work remotely and it is a great desk light and wonderful for Zoom calls when the background gets a little too dark. My only knock on this thing is that it dies so quickly. I just purchased this in Aug 2023, and am now looking for another in December. I've had to return multiple lights because they die within days. the plug can be very finicky and you have to have it in the perfect spot to turn it on. I am now looking into other more expensive options because this just isn't cutting it anymore.",
