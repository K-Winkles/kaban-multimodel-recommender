                "reviewText": "I purchased this light for the church piano as our old fashioned desk lamp died. This is a nice arch over the piano front so we can clearly see what we are playing. the three levels of light are great for us on darker days since we don't have tons of light coming in.The only downside is that it goes from low to bright then off. Since the low is PLENTY light enough, it means we have to tap the light three times before it turns off. I think it would have been better to do it the opposite way. But it's a quick three taps so not a big deal.",
