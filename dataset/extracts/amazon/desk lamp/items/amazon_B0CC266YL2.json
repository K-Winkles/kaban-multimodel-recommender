Has different light settings which light up very well. Easy touch design to turn off/on etc. What I didn\u2019t like too well it comes with a USB cable and I thought I had to charge it and then disconnected from the USB cable and I could use it as it turned out I have to keep the USB cable connected to the light and the walls in order for it to work, I was kind of disappointed about that. I thought that I could just charge it and have it on my desk and then just charge it as need be. But I\u2019m gonna stay because as I said, the design is beautiful and I like the different light settings on it. Oh, and I like the height of it. It is not short nor too high, and you can adjust the arm of the light so you can have it either up or down the arm and you could either have light more concentrate in one area or you can have the arm up where it gives light to the room.",

Light weight, fits in perfectly on my desk, enjoy the 5 different light types or brightness's, the nightlights on the sides are a big perk, I don't use the timer. I would give it a Perfect 5 stars if it was actually a bit brighter. I do love and use it a ton, just kind of thought the brightest mode would be brighter. I love to leave it on all day long to help brighten my paperwork on my desk - I work from home so this helps a ton. I hope it has a long, long life on my desk - working hard.",

Like that it can be titled vertically and provide lighting when in video meetings.It would be nice if the head could swivel left-right and not just up-down.A wireless charging base would be neat, but impossible at the price-point.Would definitely buy again.",

Only issue I have is it didn't come with its own charging cord, so I'm gonna have to buy one. Also, the USB-C is only for charging the lamp... my phone charger is USB-C to USB-C so I have to buy a new phone charger that is USB-A to USB-C. It's not a big deal, but for it to be functional in my space I am having to spend an extra $20 on top of the lamp cost... so that's a little unfortunate, but other than that I love it and it works really well.",
