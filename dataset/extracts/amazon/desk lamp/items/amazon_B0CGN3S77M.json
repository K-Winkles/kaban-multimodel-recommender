                "reviewText": "At first when looking into buying a lamp for my desk, I wanted a wireless one for reading. But I found myself buying this one. I've been using this lamp for a few months now and the only issue with it is that the wireless phone charger is not the greatest. However the lamp its self is great, it has four colors modes which gives it some variety and five different brightness levels which I love to use for reading or working at my desk. And my favorite part about this lamp is that the stem to the lamp is very flexible for all my working needs. price 10/10, quality so far 10/10 and for space consumption 9/10.",

I used it for 5 days in my home office, was away from home for 2 weeks, came back and it doesn't work. The cable & transformer work but not the lamp. I would have got more usage out of one charge of my head torch.Now I can't return it without the original package. WASTE OF MONEY! And not to mention that it will end up in a dump site after a few hours of usage, all that materials, labor, transportation because the vendor wanted to sell a crappy product.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked this little desk light. It is simple and stylish, and has fantastic touch controls! I tried really hard to keep it, placing it in several locations and living with it for a while.For my desk area, it was fantastic for everyday work. It failed at being bright enough (more lumens) for project work. (It was such a great price for the style and features, I was thinking about keeping it and buying a second portable project light, that I could hide when not needed.)I also found it to be a bit short. I preferred something taller. While this wasn't a deal breaker for my desk area, it was a problem for my nightstand where I tried it out next.My nightstand is a bit distant from the bed, so the gooseneck wasn't long enough to bend and get a nice angle when reading in bed.I also discovered a concern with the built-in wireless charger. It would produce an above average amount of heat and there was an audible buzz or ring when charging my phone. I decided not to use it at all. (At my nightstand location, this was not a big problem, as I prefer to use wireless chargers for trickle charging and prefer to plug in overnight.)Lastly, I liked the USB pass through on the side of the base. Some have them on top, which I find to be a little messing looking.I did end up returning it, but I would strongly encourage people that are considering this lamp, to give it a try!",
