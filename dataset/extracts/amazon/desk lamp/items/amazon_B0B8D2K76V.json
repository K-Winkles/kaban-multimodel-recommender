                "reviewText": "This little lamp was such a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s gorgeous! It also, for its size, puts out a ton of light. It is a great visual reminder of the mid-century Modern lamps of my youth. It was easy to put together, and is so attractive, that I just put another two of them in my shopping cart.The lamp arrived completely intact, with no damage at all. It was obvious that it was brand new stock. Its little box was sturdy, and kept the shade well protected.Our bathroom doesn\u2019t have a window, so it is lit by either the fixture on the ceiling (yuck) or a lamp we plug into the wall. For some reason, whatever wattage light bulb we try in our plug-in lamp, the light in there is either unpleasantly bright or ends up being at a level preferred by the Mole People. But the design of this lamp, with its cylindrical shade enclosing the bulb on all sides, gives off a good deal of light, while enabling that illumination to be diffuse, and pleasant.The bulb that comes with the lamp is surprisingly bright. We have a dark corner of the bedroom that we just wanted a bit of light in- nothing too bright. The neutral design of the lamp is perfect for the bedroom (for any room, really) but the bulb that came with it was far too bright for our preferences. No problem. We put a 15 watt bulb in it, and that wattage is working beautifully. This lamp takes E26 bulbs, the standard sized socket bulb you find everywhere.The light bulb that came with this lamp will be perfect for the bathroom, and also for illuminating a small room that contains the bathroom sink that also has only one bright ceiling light in it. The same difficulty with not enough light or too much was going on here, too. So we can\u2019t wait to replace our old cheapie big box store desk lamps with these Minimalist Nightstand Lamps.It is kind of a bummer that this little lamp only comes with one type/color of shade. I am planning to water down some black acrylic paint and tint one of the shades with it. I\u2019ve done this before with this kind of lamp shade, but will be sure to test a small non-obvious area first, and do the thinnest, most minimal layers to build to a pleasant tone. You have to be very careful that the water doesn\u2019t cause the lamp to warp. If I see that happening at all, I\u2019m going to stop. The other idea would be to wrap the lamp with sheer fabric affixed to the top and bottom of the shade with a minimal amount of fabric glue.The design of the shade does remind me of the lamps in my parent\u2019s house when I was a kid. The style evokes a pleasant, late 50s early 60s time of optimism and plenty. Plug in these lamps, put on some Dave Brubeck, spritz on some Ma Griffe, and be transported back to a time when beautifully designed furnishings were created for all to enjoy. As was the slogan in Charles and Ray Eames\u2019 creative offices: \"We want to make the best for the most for the least.\u201dI think Charles and Ray would approve of this quietly very stylish little lamp.",
