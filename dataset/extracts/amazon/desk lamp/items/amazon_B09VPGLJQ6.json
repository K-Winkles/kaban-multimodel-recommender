Flexible neck is firm enough to hold the head in any usable position. Switch seems solid and durable. Black paint is nice matte dull color. With LED bulb, shade doesn't overhead so it is not too hot to adjust by hand. Great price for a very functional and good looking desk lamp. I've been using it for about a month with no issues.",
