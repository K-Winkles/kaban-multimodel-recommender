Something small enough that I wouldn't knock off desk as well as tall enough to be above my (laptop) screen. This fits the back of my desk nicely, although the clamp is a bit larger than the lip of the desk, it tightens easily enough and has done no damage to the wood. The 2 seamless controls are convenient and perform well. 3 types of temperature light is helpful at different times of day/night, eye strain and the dimming function is fluid. Gooseneck and tilting lamp are most useful. Fills all my needs at the desk, I am sure it will help at my jigsaw table as well. Nicely made, sturdy for a slender clamp on. Great price.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a desk lamp that would illuminate my desk, preventing eye strain while writing while using my PC. So far, I am very satisfied with the lamp.The lamp boasts high build quality, with its body almost entirely made of metal. The gooseneck is firm, holding its position, and the touch controls are intuitive and responsive.For those using it with a monitor, the most crucial feature is the asymmetric light pattern. I compared the SUPERDANNY lamp to other gooseneck desk lamps without this feature and am impressed by the light pattern. No direct light hits my eyes, and glare on the monitor is minimal, even though the lamp illuminates a large area of the desk. I've included a picture that shows the light pattern. The color temperatures and brightness controls are as advertised.The mounting clamp is very low-profile, allowing only a few millimeters of gap if pushed against a wall. The clamp is padded on both sides to prevent marring of the desk surface, although the padding on the bottom side seems minimal. For those with very expensive desks, felt tape or cloth can be used as extra padding.The lamp is an extremely good value at $30 and occasionally $20 on sale. For the money, I couldn't be happier. Only time will tell whether the LEDs will last on the lamp, but based on my impression of the product, I have a feeling that they will.",
