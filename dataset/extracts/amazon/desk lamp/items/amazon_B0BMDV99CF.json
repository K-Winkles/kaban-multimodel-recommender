                "reviewText": "This lamp has become difficult to find in our home because everybody seems to have a use for it. The compact size and ability to fold into a small size (for a lamp) mean that my daughter can fold it up and put it in her laptop case for use at the library. The carrels there are not well-lit, so she takes this lamp and plugs the USB A to USB C cable into her power bank and can use it for hours on end. There is also a USB A outlet receptacle so she can charge her phone and iPad also. The light does not strobe or flicker, it's very even and great for reading. There was a comment about only being able to use the USB C cable that it came with, but we've not had that issue. We use generic USB A to USB C cords with no problem.I use this lamp for sewing at night and really like the selectable color temperature and brightness. I sew for community projects and it's often late at night when I get around to this. I select a warmer color temperature and a mid-level brightness that doesn't hurt my eyes. And taking a move from my daughter, I plug this into a power bank so I can use it and sew anywhere my heart desires.Hubs uses this outside on a table by our grill. It's not lit very well at night, but he cranks up the brightness and white color temperature -- it really lights up the grill and surrounding.We didn't expect this light to be so versatile and hadn't thought about how handy it would be to power it from a modest size power bank. But now that we've experienced how easy it is to put light wherever we want it, and to easily fold and transport it, there's no going back. We'll be looking for these features in the next lamp we get.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp design is versatile as you are able to rotate adjust the light bar, rotate and angle adjust the light support bar and control the light temperature and its brightness. The lamp electricity input is driven by a provided cable (USB-A to USB-C) which is plugged into the USB-C port at the back. The cable can then be plugged into any USB-A port charger, or to the USB-A port at the back of your computer if nearby. I find that it would work with any USB-A charger, but somehow it only works with the provided cable and not just any USB-A to USB-C cable. Also available near the electricity input port is a USB-A port which you can use to charge your phone or any external device. Turning the lamp on/off is via touch at the base. Also, you can adjust the light brightness by sliding your finder on the light brightness gradient on the base (from low to high). Light temperature adjustment is available with 5 different light temperature, from warm to white. A timer function is also available to auto turn off the lamp after 30 min. A night light function also is available by turning on the soft light source at the base of the lamp.Although with such versatile design with the lamp, I am disappointed with the intensity of the light even at max level. This lamp will work if used to light up a small area, but with a large desktop it will not do the job.",
