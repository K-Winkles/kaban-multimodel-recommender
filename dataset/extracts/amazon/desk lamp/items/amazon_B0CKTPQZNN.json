                "reviewText": "It's difficult to find a well-reviewed swing lamp in this price range, but I love this one.First, the clamp to hold to a surface is robust, all metal, strong, and opens up to 2.5 inches.Next the 'arms' are about 15\" each, so you've got a good distance to work with, and they hold position easily. Next, the shade (which is removable) mounts firmly to the socket, and covers a normal E26 bulb so there's no glare side-to-side. The only slight negative is it's not \"locked\" into the clamp, so when repositioning it, you'll need to be careful about that. But given its other strengths, this is still the lamp I was looking for.Edit: Note this review is for the Globe 56963 Black lamp. Reviews for several different Globe lamps have been merged here -- the ones with plastic clamps are not as good.",

I was amazed that there was no real damage to the lamp itself. The light cover was slightly bent and could be bent back to fit. Once I put it together and cleaned the markings off the base of the lamp as well as I could, it looks practically brand new and works perfectly. I love it!!Definitely happy that I skipped the full price version for this one!",

Any time you have a switch on a cord you can expect the the wire going in or out of the switch to fail and it did. Plus it is not convenient to turn it off and because you have to trace the switch following the wire.I purchase this unit specifically because the switch was on the top where I could always find it fast. That and the fact that I could put what ever extra high wattage lamp I wanted into the socket.I like this lamp except for one thing. The lamps reflector sort of screws on. It is only a fraction of turn thread with a dimple on the base holding it on. Look at it wrong and it falls off. A little glue took care of that problem. Faced with this lamp or a switch on a cord lamp I would take this one any day. Also, make sure the bulb you use is not so heavy that the lamp can't hold it up.",
