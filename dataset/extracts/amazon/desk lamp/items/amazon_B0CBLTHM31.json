                "reviewText": "i used these to light areas in all most of my rooms of my apartment. everything about them is good.bendable necks that are long and flexible. they turn on and off well and have different brightness capacity [honestly i generally use the one they turn on with preset]. they aclamp well and stay well on different typs of surfaces- think of a big hair clamp or or a clamp for workroom but less large-but still sturdy. i already had them and bought more rather than a much more expensive stadning lamp as these are completely mobile and can just be carried from one room to another and then back again. Also they stay when pointed at something. the design of the necks on them is flawless - allowing the right amount of torque without unbalancing the clamp of making it fall from where it is clamped on. Also you can sort of use it as a spotlight if there is a darkl corner in a room and you want to be able to see a corner etc. All in all these are a really good buy in my opinion and would work anywhere you go. Also easy to pack if you are travelling and want to make sure you have enough light where you end up. I highly recommend these lights. they are carefully packed with minimum fuss, and easy to set up anywhere that has a surface to clamp to or you could even really lay them down on a surface if need as long as you kept the neck 'light side up!' and the surface was flat. this is a nice clean design. i hope this helps anyone decide. I think these are great!",

                "reviewText": "I say \"almost perfect\" for only one reason. The neck is VERY long. And that's only a problem for my specific use case, which is as a reading light on my headboard. I ended up just curling the neck up to keep the light close to the headboard. Since many people will USE all of that neck length, I'm still giving this a 5 star rating.One very nice feature is the diffuser on the lamp- rather than throwing bare LED light at you, it's softer & more evenly distributed. No hot spots. This was an important selling point for me, as a reading lamp.The various adjustments to both light temp & brightness ensure that you're going to get the right light for your specific use.The clamp is STRONG - even with that long neck, I can position the neck almost full length out from the clamp, which is clamped to a ROUND bar, and the clamp holds its position most of the time. With the neck curled closer to the base, it's rock solid. And on a flat clamping surface, it's not even a concernI 3D printed a small holder for the control box so I could mount it to the headboard with some double sided tape. Stops it from sagging behind my pillow & getting me tangled in it, etc., and I always know exactly where the control box is for quick, no-look access.",

                "reviewText": "No longer will you struggle with your light source as an artist or crafter! This thing saves space on your desk by being a clip-on, it delivers a very bright and even light that's adjustable, and the gooseneck is very firm and very flexible at the same time. A very smart, very perfect purchase for a long time artist. The clamp is tight, and you never have to worry about it slipping off where it's clipped. I love it so much! And it keeps the bright light out of my eyes and onto my canvas - just perfect. Awesome.",

But I am keeping it because overall it's helped more than its hindered.",

I was skeptical that the clamp would be good enough to hold in the location I needed but it's holding very well. The range of light intensity and color is very flexible and easily changed, which I love - warmer color for fiction reading, daylight for reading quilting magazines where color is more important. My only concern with this product is that the light on the on/off switch is extremely bright blue. I wish it was a lot dimmer or able to be turned off.",

There is a very bright piercing blue light on the on/off button. If you use it at your desk or anywhere you are not sleeping then it is a great product. I would suggest if they must put a light on it that it be a soft deep red which would be much less obtrusive. Anyway I fixed the problem with a bit of black paint.",
