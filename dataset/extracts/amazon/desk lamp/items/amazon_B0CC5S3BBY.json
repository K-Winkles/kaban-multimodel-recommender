It's easy to put together, so if I want to take it apart to pack in my suitcase, reassembly is super easy. It's actually compact enough you don't have to take it apart to pack with you, depending upon your packing space. I really love the gooseneck to redirect light where I want it. The lighting can be programmed for reading, or brighter for work projects, and it has a nightlight. It has a light slide so you can raise or lower the brightness. It's sturdy, lightweight, and it's design will fit most decors without being obtrusive.",
