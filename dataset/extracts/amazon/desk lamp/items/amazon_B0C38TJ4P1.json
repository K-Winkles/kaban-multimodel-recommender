Three brightness levels are nice for background to reading and the long flexible neck gives you lots of options.I didn't want a battery powered light for my nightstand and it is not clear from the advertisement, but you can just leave it plugged into the charger and use it like a regular light. Maybe someday the portable battery function will come in handy. My only criticism is that it is a little light weight and depending on how you position the arm it can tend to tip easily. Overall, I am pleased though.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp IS bright, and I like it for lighting up my bedroom as well as my vanity table. However, the ad says it is 900 lumens, but I have a 760-lumens bulb that is brighter than this. It also does not seem to be charging to full. I have had it for about two weeks and it has been plugged in for almost all of that time, with minimal usage, but the red dot has not changed to any other color or turned off. I didn't see any manual or information on how to tell if there is a full charge, etc. I unplugged it a couple of times, but it then only takes about an hour or so for the lamp to go out. So I just keep it plugged.I like the nightlight feature as well, although I don't really use it much because I already have another lamp for that purpose.The lamp is on the heavy side and you have to be careful when positioning it. Like other gooseneck lamps, you have to tilt the neck backward before moving it forward in order for the lamp to maintain its balance. Don't just stretch out the neck willy-nilly and still expect the base to hold its position.",

                "reviewText": "I love this desk lamp! This was ordered for doing artwork, or reading at the desk, and boy does it do its job well.It came exactly as advertised - looks no different from the photos. The brightness levels are fantastic! The brightest is not quite bright enough to fill a room super brightly (though it's obvious that a light is on), but it's absolutely perfect for lighting up the workspace on a desk, which is exactly what we needed. The lower levels are also fantastic - great for if you're trying not to keep someone awake, but still want to see what you are doing. The power button, which also works to adjust the brightness, is more a \"sensor\" type button than a button that you press.The light is nice and flexible, and can be adjusted to swivel in multiple directions. It can be plugged into a USB port, or a block with a wall outlet. I love its versatility, knowing that you can take it just about anywhere and still be able to use it.The charging feature is also great. It's nice to know you can grab the lamp and bring it somewhere with you - it's great for road trips, staying in hotels, or going just about anywhere you might want to take it.Definitely can recommend this lamp!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, a USB powered desk lamp that's actually bright",
                "reviewText": "I've previously had a few USB-powered lamps that can best be described as anemic. Anemic in the amount of power it draws, and anemic in the amount of light produced. I think of them as emergency illumination, or at best nightstand lights for the bedroom. Not this one; this one is BRIGHT, and I love it. I'm a fan of USB-powered devices and think a lot more should be powered by them, for the versatility, interchangeability of power supply, and reduced e-waste. This USB-C powered lamp allows you to to use it with any USB charger under the sun, phone battery power banks, power stations with USB ports, car USB sockets etc. Not only that, but it comes with a built-in 2400mAh battery, and so you could bring it for camping, BBQing in the dark, reading in the breeze at sunset, or dinner outside without worrying about power sockets or wires. (The product listing states that the battery will last 2 hours at maximum brightness; to make it last longer, plug in a portable USB power bank.) There are 3 light levels, and if you're wondering why there is a frosted ring at the base, it's a handy nightlight that glows with warm light when you long press the power button. The color temperature is white, but not harsh or cold; I would guess around 4700-5000K or so.Couple of tips:1) When the battery is charging and the light is on at max brightness, I observed the USB power draw could be up to 13 watts (5V x 2.6A). And if you use the built-in USB-A port at the base to charge other devices, the draw could be even higher. A USB charger / power bank capable of 3A output at 5V is best to get the most charging speed out of this lamp.2) I saw some complaints about this lamp being top heavy and prone to tipping over. I didn't find that to be the case, but if the lamp head is craned far forward of the base I could see that happening. For better balance, do what the listing photo does: bend the neck BACKWARDS first, THEN forward.Recommended!",
