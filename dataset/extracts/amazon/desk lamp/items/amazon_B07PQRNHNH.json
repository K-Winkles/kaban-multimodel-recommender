                "reviewText": "Would I buy this lamp again or recommend it to someone I know? Absolutely.Pros:\u2022 Good value\u2022 Shipped on time in perfect condition\u2022 Looks great\u2022 Dim, soothing, orange lighting (plenty bright depending on the bulb you use)\u2022 Multifunctional (lighting and storage)\u2022 Super easy to assemble\u2022 Clear, simple instructions for any skill level (it's on one sheet of paper)Cons:\u2022 Cannot accomdate my iPad (2nd Gen, 12.9\") while in its case (it *can* accommodate it with ease when it's out of the case)\u2022 Cardboard box and plastic packaging were a bit of a hassle to open (but clearly largely responsible for product showing up in perfect condition-- it was resolved with a standard set of scissors and some patience)\u2022 Does not come with a bulb (this is not a huge deal for me-- I'm pretty sure they mentioned it in the description, it's just worth noting)I love mine so far. It was in my budget, and I desperately needed to save space on my nightstand.Between my CPAP, the box of tissues, my glasses, my wallet, and other odds and ends that wind up there by the end of the day, this lamp has decluttered things significantly, and brightened up my room substantially.It has the exact aesthetic I wanted, and it was in my price range-- it gives off a nice, warm, dim, orange glow because of the canvas shade, which is great for winding down at the end of a day.I want to put a less intense bulb in mine soon, I just used what I had around. On a related note, the E26 base on the lamp works with an A19 bulb.The packaging on this lamp is *good* at what it does. This thing showed up in perfect condition, and I credit it largely to this packaging, but the drawback was it was a bit difficult to get the box open, get it out of the box (it was packed in there pretty tightly, I wanted to be careful with it), and unwrap the plastic on the lamp itself (I used scissors on the plastic knotted around the base, and took a while unwraping the top, which had a sturdy ribbon of plastic looped all the way around).I absolutely get why they packaged it the way they did. It was efficient, effective, and conservative at keeping the lamp safe in transit, it was just a bit awkward for the person trying to use the product once it's there.That said, after I got it out of all of the packaging, the rest was a breeze. I had a brief moment of confusion when I tried to put my phone on the lamp base and it didn't fit.As it turns out, if I'd stopped to read the single sheet of instructions for 5 seconds in the first place, I'd know the lamp shows up with the shade screwed on upside down for the sake of saving space in transit.You unscrew the ring holding on the lampshade, flip the shade upside down, screw it back on, screw in your (A19) bulb, plug in your electronic devices and flip the switch, and you'll have a functional lamp in no time flat.The most time consuming part of setting it all up was actually getting it out of all of the packaging, which took about 10 minutes. Total, it took me about 15 minutes.As you pros and avid hobbyists may have figured out, assembling products is not something I do much of. So if you're like me, don't worry, this lamp is novice-friendly.One small thing that I was a bit disappointed by-- I have an iPad Pro (2nd Gen, 12.9\") that you see pictured with my review, plugged in and charging on the lamp, in one of the base slots.It absolutely does fit in that slot *without* the case on, but it doesn't fit *with* the case on. I'm a very clumsy person and I don't like to take my devices out of their cases much because they're likely to get broken, so I'll probably store my iPad next to the lamp on the nightstand until I can figure out a better solution.I am absolutely thrilled with it for what I paid. I would highly recommend this lamp if you want to make the most of your space and your money. It's functional, affordable, and it looks gorgeous in here.",

The shade was the right color to match my color scheme and the lamp was of excellent quality. The wood base holds my cell phone (with the case on) and my Kindle reader perfectly. It uses a 60 watt light bulb, which I had on hand. It is very easy to set up. The outlet and the USB ports worked fine. When turned-on the light gives a warm ambiance to the room. I am very pleased with this purchase.",

The only gripe I have is that the slots provided for sticking the devices in are too narrow and are basically non functional. So the table lamp now sits on my bedside table, occupying more real estate than it provides value for. The USB port work well and the switch at the base to turn the light on and off is convenient. It also looks good so even though the device slots are useless, it still functions pretty well in the other departments. So all in all, can't complain.",

                "reviewText": "The lamp is compact and the outlets both usb and three-prong all work well so far. It was well-packed and arrived in excellent shape. Remember when assembling the lamp to turn the shade upside down from the way it arrives as this gives proper spacing to place your phone, chargers etc.",
