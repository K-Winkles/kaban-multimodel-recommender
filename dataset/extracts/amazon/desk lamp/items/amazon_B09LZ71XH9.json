The addition of two separate pull-string switches is also very convenient, far preferrable to putting the switch up inside the shade or on the cord. The only negative: the lamp is wobbly in its stand. Just touching it and it wobbles back and forth. This seems to be the weak spot where the vertical rod meets the base. It is tightened but still wobbly. Unfortunately design flaw. Nevertheless, we will keep the items.",
