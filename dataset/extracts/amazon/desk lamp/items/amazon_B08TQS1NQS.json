                "reviewText": "After an old desk lamp of mine broke, I put off buying a new one because I just wanted a simple and cheap one but I also didn\u2019t want something that was cheap (makes sense). After realizing I will never shop for one in person I decided to look on amazon and this was one of the cheaper ones I found. For $20, this lamp is awesome. It\u2019s fully adjustable, from height to the angle as well as which way the light is tilted (towards you or towards what you\u2019re doing), and the dimmable touchscreen settings are super cool. I think I\u2019m most excited about the adjustable warmth setting as bright, white lights are harsh at night but needed during the day when your windows just aren\u2019t cutting it. Lastly, it plugs into the wall with a sleek cord that you don\u2019t even see and it has a USB port to charge your phone, which I\u2019m also excited to try out. I just got it today so we shall see how long it lasts but it seems really sturdy and very promising for how well it is built. 10/10",

There are several color options. It is well designed, sturdy, has a small footprint.I have two comments /questions. The box it came in says \"The maximum output of this USB charger is 5V 1A. Warning: This product is not suitable for charging high powered products such as tablets. The connection of anything higher than the maximum output may cause damage to the product or the device in use.\" This is a direct quote. The inside instructions do not carry such a description or warning.I find it somewhat confusingly written. I assume I can charge a phone. How many people are using this to charge iPads?A second comment is that the plug is rather close to the bottom of the upright part, so it is easier to plug it in before connecting the top lamp part to the base. If this lamp is ever redesigned I suggest the connection be moved higher about one half to one inch.May 3, 2021 Update. I have been very pleased and bought 2 more which have been set up ! Highly functional with relatively small but stable footprint. Excellent lighting.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice desk lamp, wish its light bar were wider and stand narrower",
                "reviewText": "This review is specific to the \"LED Desk Lamp, JKSWT Eye-Caring Table Lamps Natural Light Protects Eyes Dimmable Office....\".I had to move my work office, and now my desk is further from a window, and I realized quickly how much I missed the extra light on my computer keyboard. In my home office, there is no window and I had a similar problem, and found a very nice LED light bar that is similar to this product, except with a somewhat narrower base and a wider light bar. That other lamp's light bar is about the width of a typical computer keyboard, and I have the lamp positioned to be just above the front of the monitor, and sending light down uniformly to the keyboard. Unfortunately, that older lamp seems to no longer be available, so I selected the similar lamp that I am reviewing here.The LED light bar on this one (the part that actually illuminates) is about 8\" long. It appears to contain three strips of discrete round LEDs, but the translucent diffuser in front of the LEDs blurs them all together pretty thoroughly so the pattern of illumination is nice and even; no apparent hot spots.The stand part of this lamp allows a small range of lamp heights, pretty close to 19\" above the surface the lamp is resting on. The base of the stand is about 8\" x 5.25\", and about 0.75\" high. The stand extends up from the base in two parts: First, there is a 'control panel' of about 5\" long and at a 45 degree angle from the base. Then there is a pivot, and the main part of the stand rises up from that. The actual LED light bar is attached to the top of the stand via a second pivot. Both pivots move smoothly, but are firm enough that they won't sag\\, and hold their positions well. With both pivots, the lamp can be adjusted over a wide side-to-side position relative to the base, but it does not swivel at the base. The LED light bar itself has a third pivot, right next to the second pivot at the top of the stand, which allows aiming the light anywhere between forwards, straight down, and rearwards.The 'control panel' is all 'touch sensitive' operation, and is 'back lit'.....the Power ON/OFF button is always illuminated when the lamp is plugged in to the AC supply (it uses a 'universal' wall-wart style AC power supply); this button is illuminated dimly when the power is turned off, and more brightly when the power is turned on. The LED light bar brightness is controlled by a 'virtual slider dimmer' in the center of the panel; it has nine LEDs to progressively show how bright the current setting is, and although the manufacturer says the brightness is continuously variable, I don't see that it actually, or at least practically, has more then nine brightness settings. Finally, at the top of the control panel is an illuminated icon that looks like the Sun or a lamp, and tapping this button cycles through several 'light temperature' settings, which subtly varies the color of SOME of the many LEDs, to modify the overall light color. You can change it between very warm, yellowish light, very white, somewhat blue, somewhat tan, etc. Personally, I found one shade that is almost a slight pink to be the one that best illuminates my keyboard while at the same time causing least glare and minimal eyestrain. The control panel remembers the selected brightness and light temperature settings, so you don't have to re-do them each time you turn the lamp off then back on later.The lamp also has a USB A socket on the rear of the control panel; you can plug in a USB charger cable for your phone, etc (the cable is not included). There is a 1A current limit on this USB power source.The lamp seems well designed and built, and works well. I cannot predict how reliable it will be.The included single-sheet instructions are in pretty awful 'Chinglish', and are not needed anyway.My 'beefs' with this product is that the large base requires that the stand be positioned further from my keyboard than I would like, and I can't adjust the LED light bar far enough over to be centered over the keyboard, at least not without the stand's angle being such that it cuts across the corner of my monitor. To I have to live with one side of my keyboard being somewhat more brightly lit.",
