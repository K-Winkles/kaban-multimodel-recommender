                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the LED Desk Lamp and I must say, it has truly transformed my workspace. With its full dimmable touch feature and 5 color modes, this lamp allows me to adjust the brightness to my liking and create the perfect ambiance for any task. The gradual dimming from 0 to 100% brightness is a game changer and adds a touch of sophistication to my desk.One of the standout features of this lamp is its wireless charging capability. The base of the lamp acts as a wireless charger, making it convenient to charge my Qi-enabled devices such as my iPhone 11 and Samsung S9 Plus. Gone are the days of cluttered cables and searching for chargers - this lamp truly integrates technology seamlessly into your workspace.The addition of the auto-off timer is another fantastic feature. Whether I'm working, reading, or even sleeping, I can simply touch the timer and the lamp will automatically turn off after 30 or 60 minutes. It's a small yet thoughtful feature that adds convenience to my daily routine.The foldable and portable design of this lamp is also worth mentioning. With its flexible arm and rotating base, it can be easily adjusted to save desk space and stored away when not in use. Its modern design complements any decor, making it a versatile addition to any office or bedroom.What really sets this desk lamp apart is its commitment to eye care. The soft, stable, and non-flickering light ensures that my eyes are not strained during long working hours. With a lifespan of over 50000 hours, this lamp is built to last for more than 25 years, eliminating the hassle of bulb changes.Overall, the LED Desk Lamp from Dott Arts is a must-have for anyone seeking to enhance their workspace. With its wide range of features and sleek design, it combines functionality with style. Additionally, the 365-day worry-free service and lifetime customer support provided by the manufacturer give me peace of mind. I highly recommend this lamp - it's a game changer.",

                "reviewText": "Update: After a week or two of use the touch panel will intermittently stop working and I have to unplug and plug back in the lamp. Save yourself the time and buy something else. Original: The hinge is heavier weight than I expected which gives a feeling of quality. I am sensitive to hums and mine is not humming. I like the adjustable color temp. It\u2019s bright enough for reading. The cord is a little short and it\u2019s USB. It\u2019s like 4 or 5 feet long so had to move the lamp to the other side of my bedside table to reach outlet. The placement of the phone on the wireless charger is not too finnicky, I don\u2019t really have to pay attention too much to where I set it down, and i tried moving the phone around to see if it would keep charging and it does. It probably has about a 2-3 inch radius to where it has to be line up to work which is normal. Ya it chargers slow because it\u2019s a 5w charger but slow charging over night is fine. If you need a fast top up use a fast charger, not this. For the price I\u2019m super happy I can read at night without turning on the overhead lights.",
