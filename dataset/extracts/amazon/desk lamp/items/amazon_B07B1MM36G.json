                "reviewText": "We have a new head board with new bedside tables and were looking for a lamp which was USB plug-in capable. I have been searching for \"the\" lamp since last year. Either prices were too high, reviews were terrible or a number of other issues.The negative reviews on here didn't really relate to the lamp, so those were discarded as null to me. I went on other websites that sell this same lamp, and for the most, they were all positive. In addition, other sites were typically double the price found on Amazon.So it made it past the review stage and of course the looks stage. Thus I purchased it.All parts were within the box and were still wrapped in the plastic that covered each of the pieces. The exterior of one box was damaged, but fortunately it didn't affect the lamp within.The only thing you have to do, once unwrapped, is find a lightbulb (40W or less) and twist it and the shade into place. Then tada! You are done.I did have one issue with the lightbulb not working. It worked, and then it wouldn't turn on. I was able to fix that by finding another bulb. So far both lights are working well and add a great ambiance to the room.So at this point I have absolutely no regrets in purchasing it. It's stable enough that my cat will not be able to knock it off with their typical \"let's knock everything off the table\". It's sturdy and puts out a good amount of light. And the price is right!!!",

I really like the switch on the base, rather than the cord so you dont have to go digging for the switch.I havent used the USB ports yet, but they're a nice feature too.The only downside I have has they are made to be desk lamps, not nightstand lamps, and as such, they are made direct all the light onto something, like say, a desk! It doesnt light the room overall, which I guess I expected. So I'll likely see if I can track down a clear shade for these. But of course, that isnt the lamp's fault.All in all though, I really like these.",

I also like that it has a USB port in the back - bonus functionality point there. I do wish the shade could bend a tiny bit more down to control the brightness better, but I contacted their customer service people about bulb options who quickly responded with suggested models of softer lightbulbs that would work which I'll try out. But I thought it was a great product for a low price.",
