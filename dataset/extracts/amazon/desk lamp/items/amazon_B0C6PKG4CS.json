                "reviewText": "I got this in and thought it was very nice looking however I had the same issue as someone else in the night light started blinking on and off. Being that it was on my desk it was very distracting since the blinking was very random.The interface: Indented icons which could have been filled with a different colored plastic (like white) which are touch sensative. With a lack of physical switches, it's very hard to turn the light on as you would just have to know how far in from a corner each of the buttons are. Can be learned but still challenging.Second interface is for clock control and that's behind the clock section of the arm. Would have to memorize which button does what as you have to use them without looking at them to set the clock. This seems to be normal for many clocks, of course once set, why do you need to touch it again, except this clock was losing 1 min each week if not more.For those that think this might be good on a night stand, the clock is rather bright and is a night light all on it's own.I would keep it for my computer desk if it wasn't for the clock losing time and the actual night light blinking randomly.",

                "reviewText": "Set up is like any other digital clock and alarm. The presets for the light type and brightness work well for a small set up, illumination is consistent. The little night light is helpful, the temperature is accurate and takes into account heat out put from the lamp. both AV work, the 2 usb ports work, and the 1H timer is a very nice addition for those that lose track of time at our desks.It's sleek, can be folded up and out of the way easily which is a big plus. You can still use both AV outlets when lamp is collapsed.The material of the base picks up visible oil from hands and you can see the prints from your fingers.The collapsing function wont have the lamp close, flush, against the front where the digital screen which is a manufacture issue, the hinge that adjusts the upper lamp has some set angles but its not incredibly actionable if that makes sense. You can affix it in a position and it falls slightly before it stops just a bit less than the angle you raise or lower it to.Overall its a modern and cheap, ascetically pleasing black lamp. I'd recommend it 100%.((Edit) the nightlight triangle seems to have a defective quality on mine. It flickers and does not heed to the on and off switch for the lamp light it self or the nightlight button. Only unplugging it will stop the blinking. I hope that function short-circuits soon so it doesn\u2019t distract me anymore. 11/16))",
