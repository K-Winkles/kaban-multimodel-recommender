It\u2019s wireless and rechargeable with included cord. I love how simple it is, and the amount of light is perfect!I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I really wish it had an extra USB charging port to charge other accessories (like a lot of small lamps like this) but the folding and lightweight aspects were more important for me.A huge bonus for me is that this isn\u2019t a touch light in the sense of \u201ctap it anywhere and it lights up\u201d. I\u2019ve used those in the past and they can be SO sensitive, where I often end up tapping it accidentally in the middle of the night & it lights up blinding me. Then you have to tap multiple dim settings to turn back off. This one has a clear icon where to tap on/off.Should also mention this only has one light setting, not multiple brightness levels.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this little lamp so give light to wherever I might want it without a cord. It is stable and easily adjustable. I can aim the light wherever I wish. I came back to give a 4 star review because it was dim, but then I read that the brightness is smoothly adjustable by holding down the power switch. That takes it over the top. I really like that it is rechargeable rather than needing batteries, too. And it collapses easily into a small flattened bundle that takes little space. The light comes down from the flat lamp surface, so I can use it without it shining into my eyes. I can use it at night in a dark room and set it to very low brightness, so it is enough to read without bothering sleepers, and in a lighter room I can turn the light up smoothly to the level I need. I HIGHLY recommend this great little lamp.",

                "reviewText": "As a colorist, I have been looking and looking for a cordless desk lamp that offers close-up lighting. I\u2019ve already had two others, and the connector for the USB cord came off \u2014 inside the lamp base, rendering them useless after the battery died. I got this one hoping \u2014 I could tell immediately that if I try and remove the USB it also will fall into the lamp base. So I keep it in all the time, which really does detract from it\u2019s portability. As for the light? It\u2019s decent but not great. The good news is it\u2019s light (HA! - as in weight) enough to move closer to the coloring book, and also that it doesn\u2019t tip over from a lack of ballast, like the other lamps do. It folds into itself very nicely, and will easily pack when I take it on travel. It\u2019s important to note here that when it\u2019s folded and packed, the light button is not activated, as happened with the other lamps I have tried - I would pack them, and when I got to my destination would discover that the light had been on the whole time. Not a great product, but I don\u2019t feel I wasted my money. It is attractive, and is accurately depicted in the product photos, and it appears to be sturdy when folding and unfolding.",

There had been an issue with my order on the courier\u2019s end (which is not the seller\u2019s fault at all in the first place). Before I had even realised that something went wrong, the seller started working on resolving the issue, and made sure that I was updated as soon as possible every time there was a progress.
