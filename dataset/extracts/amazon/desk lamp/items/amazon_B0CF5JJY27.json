                "reviewText": "I am using this light on my desk, keeping it neatly tucked out of the way behind my ultrawide monitor and only pulling it out when I need to use it. It puts out a LOT of light, and it's pretty adjustable to get that light just where you need it. The pivot mechanisms feel like they will last, and the clamp is very solid. My only wish would be more flexibility to the arm mount, as it doesn't allow as much lateral (left to right) movement as I would like. But for the price, I have no complaints at all and it's working great for my needs.",

It does that without issue.I tend to try to figure out items without referring to the instructions, for at least as long as I can get by with it. This one? I never needed to touch them. It comes pretty much assembled and ready for placement, just cut away the plastic sleeve and mount it.The two \"arms\" are independently manipulable, so you can direct the light as you need. Most of the lamp can be bent to and fro, so if you cannot find your ideal spot, that's probably on you.There are several light \"colors\" and brightness levels, all controlled by a very simple physical control near the base mount.One thing to note: This requires a power box. It does NOT come with one, so be sure you have one available for this. I just used an ancient one from my \"outdated cables\" box and it worked just fine. You will need one that has a USB-A plug on it.So far, so good. It seems to fill the function I got it for, just fine.",

                "reviewText": "I was initially alarmed by how small the box was that the lamp came in and thinking that the wrong item was sent. I unfolded it, set it up on my hobby work desk and turned it on. Once set up it sized as shown and it worked as advertised.The controller on the power cord selects between three lighting types, each capable of being dimmed. The timing function works good except that the red light indicating 30 minutes until it turns off is very small and difficult to see unless you are looking perpendicular to the face of the controller (this is not an issue for me as I don't think I'll use the 30 minute function).The ability of the lamp positioning is excellent. The two lamps can be separated to be in alignment for general lighting, placed side-by-side for more concentrated lighting and the adjustable neck can put the light where it is most beneficial. The small lamp head provides light without it being in the way.I work with little fiddly parts and this lamp works as I hoped it would.",

To be honest we can not satisfy more, it can expend to two feet and full cover the entire piano key board area. and it has different color and mode we can adjust it as we need so we can play piano concentratedly without dazzling light or feeling to dark. Also the memory function is what we pretty like as well, cuz we don't have to adjust it every single time for the brightness what everyone needs.",
