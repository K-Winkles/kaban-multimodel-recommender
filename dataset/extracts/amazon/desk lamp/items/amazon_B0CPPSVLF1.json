It's adjustable, which is great because my daughter likes to move it around depending on what she's doing. Sometimes she's drawing, other times she's reading, and this lamp just goes with the flow. The light it gives off is kind of soft, not that harsh, glaring type that makes you squint. It's like a gentle nudge to focus rather than a blinding spotlight. We've been using it for a while now, and I've noticed it's just the right size for her small desk. Not too big, not too small, just right.",
