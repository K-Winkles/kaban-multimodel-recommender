If you\u2019re not picky about brightness and color temperature, just need/want a no frills money saving, \u201cclassic-tech\u201d looking and perfectly priced desk LED lamp and you\u2019re reading\u2026 You have found THE ANSWER. A durable, simple, easy to operate, flicker free, dimmable, with three bonuses:1. Additional Money Saving: 60-Minute Automatic Shut Off (User initiated).2.

The purchasing department(s) could and should literally $AVE thousands of dollars investing in a better product like this TENERGY LED Desk Lamp \u2013 Think of the $AVING$...Using this TENERGY LED Desk Lamp for the past month: I know I am helping to save money, I am helping to save my eyes and I am helping to save our community.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW: I am updating my review from 1 to 4 stars as a result of the customer service I ended up receiving from the manufacturer. Even though the item was outside Amazon's return window, the Tenergy rep offered to have a new lamp sent out to me at no additional cost after learning about the issue with the USB port. They determined it must have been a defect in that particular lamp (since the USB port never worked even thought the lamp was brand new). They were very responsive and easy to communicate with on the customer service side. I just received the new lamp yesterday, plugged it in, and the USB port works! Hooray! I would definitely consider ordering from them again given the positive customer service experience and the fact that they stood behind their product.ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you are purchasing this for the USB port, beware! I purchased this lamp (new) for someone as a Christmas gift and the USB port was one of the main reasons I chose this lamp over many others. The gift recipient has been using this lamp for several weeks now as a reading light at bedtime (and the light part has been working great), but only today did they get around to trying the USB port to charge their phone. And...it doesn't work! We tried 3 different charging cords and 5 different devices. Nothing. It doesn't even charge for a moment and then stop--there is clearly no power coming from the port. Of course (as luck would have it), the \"return window\" for the lamp closed a few days ago so now we are stuck with a lamp that has a useless USB port. I don't know if I received a \"used\" lamp by mistake or if this was just a manufacturing defect, but in any case is was a major disappointment. None of the reviews I had read before purchase warned of a defective USB port, so it didn't even cross my mind that the lamp light would work (but not the USB port). So if/when you decide to buy this lamp, be sure to check the USB port right away to see if you got a dud like I did.",

                "reviewText": "The lamp base is about 7\" x 7 \", sturdy with glossy finish. The light stand folds up to about 16\" tall, extends out to about 24\", 180 degree swivel. The light modes are distinctly different and each can be set at 5 brightnesses. I like the compact built, it's a very functional lamp for reading and simple desk work. I use it as a bedside reading lamp, it doesn't take up a lot of sapce on my small side table,and the usb port provides enough power to charge a type c cable. The touch panel is accurate abd responsive,also gives the lamp a sleeker touch. A great table or bedside lamp for a modern home.",
