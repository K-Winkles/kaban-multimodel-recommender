                "reviewText": "I've tried a variety of dedicated LED desk lights, but they all seem to get in the way, and many of them don't hold position well, drooping with time. The use of a monitor-mounted desk light would seem to be ideal. I wasn't expecting much at this price point and so I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality, which is outstanding. I was so impressed that I bought a second unit.The unit is all-aluminum and well-balanced. It attaches to the monitor securely and stays put, even if the monitor is jostled. Although the unit doesn't come with it's own power supply, it comes with a standard USB A to C cable and can be plugged into any standard unused USB A socket. The included cord is 6 feet long, which is adequate to reach a separate floor-mounted USB power supply.The KableRika light adjusts easily to provide a variety of light levels and color temperatures. It's not as bright as a standard desk light, but more than adequate to light the area in front of a computer monitor. The touch controls are very easy to use, with separate controls for on-off, brightness and color temp, and it remembers the previous settings. There is also a photocell-based auto function that adjusts brightness for ambient light levels, but I find the adjustments to be counterintuitive, brightening the light in a darker room, when I'd prefer less light. The function is easily disabled in any case.One interesting thing to note is that if the light from the fixture hits the photocell on the monitor, it will cause the auto-brightness function to brighten the display. With an iMac, that's actually bright enough in a dark room to be painful, so it's particularly important to adjust the angle of the light fixture so that it doesn't strike the display. Fortunately, that is easily done.",

                "reviewText": "There is a lot to like about this light! It is sturdy and well built - I would expect it to last many years. Easy to attach to monitor, it even works well with my older monitor that is almost 3 inches thick! Adjustable range of light color and brightness are great. This is the only one I've tried that can actually be adjusted so that you do not actually see the light coming from the bar and it still illuminates the work area properly. The photo-cell based Auto-Dimming feature is a stroke of genius! The only problem is that the programming for the auto-dim seems backwards. When the ambient light is bright it dims, and when the ambient light is low it brightens. That is exactly opposite of what I find myself doing with it in manual mode. When the room is bright there is a lot to compete and you need more light on the keyboard, and when the room is dim you need much less light on the keyboard. If they could reverse the programming on the auto-dim, this light would be near-perfect! To make it truly perfect, they could program it so the light is whiter during the day (say around 5000k), and softer at low lighting levels (say around 3000k). This is what I do manually. Then this light would be truly perfect - a set it and forget it lighting solution! Add a motion sensor that would turn the light off after 30 minutes of inactivity, and it would be beyond perfect! As-is, it is still a keeper and the best of the 3 lights I've tried. I look forward to the next iteration of this great light!",

                "reviewText": "This desk lamp is very bright, bright enough to illuminate an entire 48 inch desk. The build quality is adequate, with the arms being made from plastic. The color temperature modes and brightness adjustment work as advertised, no problems there. The clamping mechanism is padded, but sticks out quite far, creating a large gap if you intend on having your desk against a wall.The light pattern leaves much to be desired. It is a simple diffused symmetrical pattern. This lights up the desk well, but the LEDs are visible to the user and are bothersome. If the lamp is being used with a monitor, it also causes much more glare than if it had a light focusing mechanism found in other gooseneck desk lamps. If you are using it solely as a desk lamp without a PC setup, I think it would be possible to adjust the light so that it isn't in your eyes, but I found that the more comfortable positions for my eyes caused more glare on the screen and vice versa.A weird thing to note: All of the reviews are for a monitor mounted desk lamp, not the gooseneck desk lamp being sold. I'm suspecting that the seller changed the listing to a different product, keeping the good reviews for the old product.",

Mon fils est ravi du remplacement de son ancienne lampe d architecte. Cela permet une luminosit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente selon s il est sur l ordinateur ou s il fait ses devoirs. Bon rapport qualit\u00e9 prix au final m\u00eame si la lampe est un peu onereuse",
