                "reviewText": "I work from home and often find myself trying to fit everything I would need on my desk in the office on my desk at home. My biggest challenge was getting a desk light that wasn't too bulky and didn't take too much room. I saw this lamp on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. First of all, the base is super small, and is weighted to prevent tipping over. It does not take any room on my desk at all! The lamp is tall and adjustable. I can move the swing arm to exactly where I need it. Especially working at night. It has 3 light modes that you can adjust to fit your needs. I use it mostly at night so the adjustable light is important, as well as keeping only my desk lit and not the entire room. I was impressed with this adjustable light that can be turned on and adjusted by a simple touch!",

It was flimsy and put out a weak light unless you were directly under it and were baking at the same time. This lamp is nothing like it and I'm really pleased I chose to get it. No springs here, just a very solid and well constructed counterbalanced light fixture. The light options are many and varied in this lamp; the light also can get extremely bright. It also has a great aesthetic. This is perfect for me. After trying several light fixtures for a bedside nightstand, I finally have exactly what I need for reading and working on my laptop while in bed (like right now).",
