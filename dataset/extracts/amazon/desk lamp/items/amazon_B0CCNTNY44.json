                "reviewText": "I have wanted a task light to illuminate my desktop in front of my monitor and keyboard. I had originally thought of installing an in-the-ceiling light fixture above my desk, but that was going to be tricky to wire and install. So when I saw the new generation of extra-tall architects lamps I decided to go that way instead.And I'm happy I did. A couple of minutes to assemble and a few more to install. Now I've got all the light I need.It was a near thing. This lamp is >just< tall enough to reach over my 27\" iMac. But it does. And it spreads the light everywhere I'd like it, while not shining directly into my eyes or causing glare on my computer screen.I've set the brightness to maximum, at least for now. I'm happy with that.It didn't take me long to decide the adjustable lamp temperature/color is also a nice feature. I've set it to the blue end of the spectrum, close to daylight.It took me a moment to discover the control buttons only need to be touched. You can't actually press them. What is nice is all the controls are all front and center -- easy to see and reach.This lamp was not the cheapest, but I think the extra cost might turn out to be worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a clamp-on LED desk lamp. The posable neck is only bendable about halfway, the bottom half is rigid. It is a total of 26\", 13\" is bendable, and is enough that I can bend it back to shine on my laptop screen, which is a good angle. The buttons are on the front of the light, easily reachable. There are buttons for the light color, intensity and power on/off. The clamp will work on a thickness up to 1.7\". The neck swivels at the clamp. The light itself also swivels at the top of the neck. They are a bit loose, but it is easy to reposition. At first I thought the lamp didn't work, wouldn't turn on. Actually, the buttons work better with a very light tap VS pressing harder. I set the color and brightness so I don't have to fool with those buttons, only the power. I find that works best when I place my index and middle fingers behind the light, and tap the button with my thumb. It illuminates the screen just enough to see well in a dim room.",

The control panel is at the top as opposed to other products with the controls on the wire underneath the table. The control panel being at the top is super convenient and accessible!

                "reviewTitle": "Tolle Leuchte, flexibel und wertig",
                "reviewText": "Wie immer sehr schnelle Lieferung durch Amazon.Die Umverpackung enth\u00e4lt eine hochwertige Schaumstoffauskleidung in der die Einzelteile der Leuchte vor Besch\u00e4digungen gesch\u00fctzt, sicher ankommen.Mitgeliefert wird eine mehrsprachige, mit guten Skizzen versehene Bedienungsanleitung und ein nett aufgemachter, kleiner Faltbogen mit einer Kontaktadresse des Herstellers f\u00fcr den Fall von Defekten oder Fragen des K\u00e4ufers.Der Aufbau ist durch das mitgelieferte Werkzeug (Kreuzschlitz) und vier Schrauben schnell erledigt.Wenn der stabile Sockel und der Lampenarm verbunden sind, kann der LED-Lampenbalken eingeclipst werden. Dieser wird danach mit dem Stecker verbunden, der vor dem Clipsprofil oben aus dem Lampenarm herausgef\u00fchrt wird.Nun muss nur noch das Kabel vom Steckernetzteil am unteren Ende des Lampenarms angeschlossen werden \u2013 fertig-.Die Leuchte in strahlendem wei\u00df macht einen wertigen Eindruck.Der Arm mit flexiblem Silicon-Mittelteil l\u00e4sst viele Einstellungen und Neigungen zu, so dass man schnell eine gute Ausleuchtung seines Arbeitsfeldes erreicht.Alle Einstellungen werden \u00fcber kleine Touch-Felder vorn am LED-Lampenbalken vorgenommen.So kann man seine Lieblingsfarbtemperatur in 6 Stufen einstellen: 3000K- 3500K- 4000K- 4500K 5000K- 6000K.Weiterhin sind die LEDs stufenlos dimmbar.Ein besonderes Feature ist die abschaltbare \u00dcberwachung der Umgebungshelligkeit, mit der die Elektronik die Helligkeit der LEDs automatisch an die Umgebung anpasst. Damit wird Strom gespart und die gew\u00fcnschte Helligkeit wird z.B. auch bei unterschiedlicher Sonneneinstrahlung gehalten.Ich habe die Leuchte nun einige Tage in Betrieb, konnte meine Lieblingseinstellung rasch finden und bin sehr zufrieden mit der blendfreien Beleuchtung des Arbeitsplatzes. Nur eine USB-Ladem\u00f6glichkeit wird man nicht finden und smart ist die Leuchte auch nicht. Der Mehrpreis gegen\u00fcber vielf\u00e4ltigen Billigangeboten ist daf\u00fcr aber erlebbar.",
