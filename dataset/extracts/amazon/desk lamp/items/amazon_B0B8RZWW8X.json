                "reviewText": "So let me say that I cant use the clamp mount with my bench its just a tad too thick , over 2 inches it would need to clear- but the clamp mount feels and looks quite sturdy- But also the REACH of this small lamp means if you DO clip it youll be working pretty dang close to the edge of your benchlike not much more than a foot depending on how high up you need to work - So the included pedestal base is nice and its what I am using. Now- its got some good weight to it and it does hold up the light but youll want to hold the base while adjusting the bend in the lamp because the neck is nice and stiff and the base will move or tip - thats unavoidable in this case. but its fine once adjusted to stand on its own.On to the item itself. For the price the magnifier is decent. Its quite usable. it is large enough for most work. The magnification is mild so you wont be using this for Ultra fine soldering or something but it is a good augmentation and makes things easier. It could also be used to read fine print effectively if your eyes are getting older and tired or you have a visual disability like my wife does. (Not a joke about my looks but I certainly don't deserve her) The light has multiple color temp modes which can help more than youd think with getting a clear look at something, and a wide range of adjustable brightness. Its plenty bright to function as a nice bright desk lamp for non magnified work. Added bonus is the base is a nice place to put thngs down or neatly store a little pair of helping hands or something since it dished you can put screws or small parts on it and they wont \"escape\". The cable is USB... so this is easy to power. It comes with the USB to wall adapter (phone charger style) as well of course.",

So you can Scooby Doo or up with a ridiculous magnifying glass!This works amazing with a rechargeable USB battery pack, highly recommend getting one as it makes it ultra portable.It's flexible and holds it's position well. Magnifying as expected.Several light modes and slight color variations. This is nice when working with small shiny things.Can't over position it to fall over with the base attached.If you are looking for something like this this works well. Also comes with a edge clamp if you don't plan to move it.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, it's a nice lamp with some good features like being able to adjust the color tone and brightness. The inclusion of a base or desk/table mount is also helpful.The only significant complaint I have right now is that the cord is shorter than expected and doesn't provide a lot of reach. It is powered by a USB cord though, so I could either plug it into a battery back or get a USB extension cable to get the extra reach needed.I haven't used the magnifying lens yet, and it could just be my inexperience with it, but it seems a little tough to get a clear focused view on the object you are trying to magnify. You have to hold it in just the right spot or the image is blurred.Lastly, the lamp base will not support the weight of the lens/light if the angle is extended too far out past the base. It seems like it's minor, but I can imagine if I were to accidentally bump the lamp a little bit while working, it might be enough force to cause it to tip over. The table/desk mount option resolves this concern, and certainly just being careful around it should be fine for me.",
