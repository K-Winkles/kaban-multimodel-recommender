                "reviewText": "I bought this bright cheerful yellow lamp for my hospital table/ tray which now serves as to serve as my nightstand. The hospital table sits rather high up in height and so the lamp reflects its light out rather well, given that the head of the lamp is flexible and be put or angled in different positions. The bright yellow color stands out and gives a very bright splash of color given the dark brown top of the hospital tray. The lamp is very well made. I love that it flexible and can be positioned in many different angles. My eyes are very sensitive to light and with its flexible neck I can chose to angle it in several ways which helps with my eyes being so sensitive to light. I love the easy rocker style switch for my hands don't work really well and the rocker switch gets it turned on and off easily. It says it comes with a lightbulb, but mine came with no lightbulb. This was a minor inconvenience I had to wait serval days to use it I don't drive anymore and had to wait until my caregiver went shopping for me. I am over all very happy with the lamp. The price is fair, and the good quality of the lamp makes the fair price even more satisfying. I would buy this lamp again if needed too.",

Also doubles as a night light for drinks of water in the middle of the night. Would be great on a desk, also. Fun color. I really like the switch on the BASE, not the cord.",
