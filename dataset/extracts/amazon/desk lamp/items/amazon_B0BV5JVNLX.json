                "reviewText": "From the pictures of the product, I couldn't tell if it was going to be high quality, but I've been pleasantly surprised by everything about this lamp. The light emitting portion of the lamp is pretty huge, and is packed with bright LEDs.The flexibility of the lamp hasn't let me down yet - it's not quite as easily positionable as a halogen -based model I bought 15 years ago, but that was significantly more expensive and had a serious flaw - the halogen light made the lamp extremely hot, but to point it, you had to move the lamp around with a handle that was close enough to the bulb that it got dangerously hot. With this lamp, the lamp never gets hot. It does take a bit more effort to position then lock down the lamp arm, but not annoyingly so.The light's color may be an issue for some. I was looking for this particular color, but many people prefer \"warm\" light, so be sure you're ordering the correct color. If you prefer light with yellowish lamp shades over the bulb, then you may not be happy with the color.I have a dsk that's difficult to attach anything to, but this clamp did a great job - truly. It feels as stable as it can be.Honestly, my biggest complaint is that someone placed a large sticker on top of the lamp that gives you the light type, the proper voltage to run it at and the number of elements that are in the light. Oh and that it was made in China. Maybe that's something their factory does, but that's a sticker that should be attached to the cord or placed underneath the device. I got it peeled off without too much effort.Very satisfied with this product - 5/5 rating.",

I think they hurt because it has only a cool light & its still too bright even on the lowest setting. Maybe i have to get use to it, idk. But if you're nail tech try to get the CCT, since it has both warm light(yellow) & cool light(white) as well & its better for your eyes. I made a mistake by purchasing the NON CCT.

                "reviewText": "I wanted a nice quality bench-mounted lamp for my workshop. It was surprisingly hard to find a proper industrial quality lamp. But I did find one at a large, well known industrial supply company that is the same size and wattage as this one. But it was a bit over $1000!This one is a bit \"consumer grade\" as opposed to industrial grade, but it is clearly built better than the $20-$40 dollar versions available everywhere. The joints seem sturdier, the lamp stays where you put it, etc.One minor inconvenience with this type of lamp is that the oblong light will interfere with the articulated arms when in certain positions.The light is adequate; not dim, but not a super-nova either. About right for my purposes. So I think this is worth the $$ if you want something a bit better than the average cheapo lamps and don't want to spend a fortune.",
