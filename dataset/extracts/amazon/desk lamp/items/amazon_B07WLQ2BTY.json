                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I needed a lamp and I like wireless chargers so I figured I'd combine them and purchase this product. The light is decently bright but not enough to light up a whole room. The lamp itself is decently flexible. The light can fold downward and in on itself, and can then open up about 225\u00b0 but can't point up while parallel to the ground. It can turn horizontally about 135\u00b0 in either direction as well. It can also bend diagonal at the base and then reach over which looks pretty cool except for the fact that it will tip over if you extend it too far due to gravity. I've only had it for a few days but the wireless charging seems to work pretty well on my Galaxy Buds. It also has a USB port at the back that outputs 1 amp of power. My biggest issue with it is that whenever I turn it off; it turns right back on. I've fiddled with the timer button thinking that maybe I hit that by accident but repeated tests with the button prove that it has no effect. There's no indicator light on the timer either to know whether or not it's active or not. The manual doesn't even mention how to use it, and similar products made by this brand use a blue and green light for 30min./60min. timer intervals, but this one doesn't. I've found a work around though; turn on the night light located on the right side of the base and the main light doesn't turn on unless you turn it on. Although the night light itself is bright and there's no way to dim it. It's either off or on. My 2nd work-around for the light was buying a smart power strip. I use my echo to simply switch off the plug connected to the lamp and boom; total darkness. Would I buy this lamp again? No. Is it a nice lamp though? For the most part, yes.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product after returning a different manufacturer's product of similar form factor. That one likewise looked and worked fine but had a design element I just couldn't get used to. I gave this one a shot and kept it because this product hit all the marks. The wireless chargers works well, and it's great to have a USB port for other needs. And the lighting it provides (the main reason for the purchase) is really nice. The product looks and feels well made. I use mine as a reading lamp sitting on a bedside table, but it would be a terrific desk lamp used in a home office or dorm room.The only negative I can cite is cosmetic and trivial in the scheme of things. The product name AFROG appears in big block letters on the base. I respect the need for brand marketing, but.. There's really no compelling reason for an obscure brand name to be so dominant on this type of consumer product. For an English speaking consumer, AFROG equates to 'a frog', and that moniker makes no sense associated with an LED desk lamp. Frankly, I'd like the product even more if the brand name had integrated into the design with more nuance. The name deserves to appear somewhere, but use of a smaller font size would be an plus.Product branding cosmetic preferences set aside, this product achieves 5 stars across the board.",
