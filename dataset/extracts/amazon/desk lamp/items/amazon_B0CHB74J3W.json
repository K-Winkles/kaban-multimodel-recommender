                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great addition to office space",
                "reviewText": "I really like this lamp. I recently upgraded to larger monitors which means that I don't have as much space on my desk for lighting. I spend a lot of time on virtual meetings and my office has limited natural lighting and there's no good way to position the desk to ensure enough light during all the hours of the workday. Therefore, my desktop lamp was a necessity. Now that I don't have the space anymore, I needed a different solution and this lamp really fit the bill. Installation was a breeze and as I was putting it together I noticed how sturdy the whole thing was. It's made of high grade heavy duty metal, so there is no concern at whether it will last. The aesthetics of this lamp are excellent... Nice and sleek - much better than my previous standard table lamp. Best of all, it's very wide, so it covers a large area and provides even light.One of my favorite things about this lamp is the remote control. Many times throughout the day as I'm working, I keep the light off because I don't need a task light, however, if I get a video call then the lighting will be too low for the camera. The camera so I need to be able to turn the light on and off several times throughout the day. The remote makes this possible without having to reach way up to the power button on top of the lamp. The remote control is not your typical remote, and in the best way possible. It's a little cylindrical object the size of a hockey puck and you can adjust the brightness by turning it left or right. You can turn the whole thing on and off simply by pressing the top. This is great because you don't have to look for a button on a specific location on the remote, because the whole thing acts as the on and off button. Another wonderful addition on the device is the fact that it has a USB charging port on the base of the stem. I never knew I needed this lamp and it's corresponding remote but now that I have them I would not give them up. Obviously I would very much recommend this lamp, especially at this price point.There are a couple of things that I would change about this lamp. If I could. The first would be that I would allow it to be mounted or attached to a surface in multiple ways. The way it is now it has to be able to be mounted the way you would mount anything with a c clamp. I would also make it so that the angle of the light itself could be adjusted. I would imagine that some people would need lighting directly to their face, while others might just want to illuminate the items on their desk more. This lamp does have a very happy medium between those two needs. However, you will not be able to make any adjustments. Finally, I would want to make this lamp height adjustable. To be clear, it is possible to adjust the height by changing the angle of the arms on the back, but in my case I have very large monitors, and on top of that they are attached to a monitor stand which I have adjusted to a particular height that makes them ergonomic. Because of this, I have very little to work with as far as making any more adjustments to the height or angle. I have pretty much maxed out the length of the arm.Again, I am very happy with the placement and think that this lamp makes a wonderful addition to my office. Despite the things I would change, I still think it's a superior product to the other ones that are available and would recommend it to anyone.",
