The bulb has a cover over it which looks nice. The touch switch is quite erratic, sometimes takes multiple touches. Thus, 3 stars. Was considering sending it back but I like that it has a heavy base, a real plus compared to some of the cheap lights, and it looks sharp. Goose neck adjusts easily but is solid. Nothing about this light looks or feels cheap. I was concerned it wouldn't be bright enough on high setting, but it is quite bright. Be aware the color of the light is on the cool side. I can't predict longevity. It enhances my desktop.",
