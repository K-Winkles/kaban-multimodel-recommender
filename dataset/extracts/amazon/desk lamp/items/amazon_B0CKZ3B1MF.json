I'm particularly impressed with the heavy base--very stable! The 24\" expanse of the light/control bar covers my entire work space plus materials required (and is adjustable). The control bar contains multiple intensities of light and color temperature settings which, once set to your preferences, can be turned off or on with one touch and without need to reset. The design of the lamp not only streamlines the look of my office but also provides additional space on the desk --no need for 2 lamps any more. Just for fun: The instruction manual also contains a clever letter from the lamp to the new owner! I recommend this product. Barbara Price, Hemet, CA",

The base is solid metal but still thin enough to not take up too much room. Product came with a small screwdriver for the screws but I used my own. Took me a couple minutes to set up and it was ready to go.",
