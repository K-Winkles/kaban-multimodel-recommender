                "reviewText": "I got this to put on my nightstand next to my bed. It is perfect as a reading light with 3 different colors of light and 5 adjustments from low to high. I really like the ability to tilt the light source to direct the light. I have also used the timer to allow the light to turn itself off after one hour. The built in phone charger has been \"hit or miss\" for me. It may be that I did not set the phone squarely on the base. It charges slowly and takes all night on the charger to reach 100% on my phone. Also, the \"on/off\" touch bottom is right on the edge of where the phone sits on the base. I have picked up the phone in the middle of the night to check the time and I inadvertently swiped the light \"on\" button so the light blasts in my face. Again, more than likely \"user operator error\". I am more careful picking up my phone from the base charger. Good solid metal construction. Nice LED light bar. Overall a quality item.",

                "reviewText": "Really nice desk lamp. Has six brightness levels and 5 color temperatures. There are two sets of LEDs - warm and cool. It on the middle three settings it blends them at different brightness levels.Photos show light at brightest and dimmest setting on \"cool\" light, brightest setting at warm light, the most upright position it can go in, and the lowest position it can go in (without tipping over).This has a 12 volt 2 amp DC wall adapter. It appears to have a standard size barrel jack, so with an adapter you could likely run it off the 12 volt DC of a vehicle or RV.Cons of the light are: USB output is only 1 amp and the wireless charger can get hot while charging my iPhone 12 Pro MAX (but my phone is almost 3 years old, has been dropped hundreds of times, and is in a thick Otterbox defender pro case).Besides the two cons above (and the 2nd is possibly my phone), I really like this lamp and recommend it.i",

                "reviewText": "I am quite impressed by this LED lamp and it turned out to be much better than expected at this price. The lamp is very well made and feels like a professional unit, in part being constructed of aluminum. It looks quite stylish and looks great on the desk where it now proudly sits. The unit is powered by a small power supply and once plugged in, the lamp is turned on with a touch of a capacitive touch On/Off pad on the base of the unit. If I were to have one small gripe it would be to have the On/Off pad illuminated as it is hard to see in a dimly lit room when trying to hit it with a finger, but after a few uses I figured I could just use my palm on the base and that turned it on or off which turned out was much easier. There are a good range of color choices and each one can be dimmed in increments.On testing the wireless charging pad with my Samsung S22 I was surprised to see it indicate it had switched to fast charging! Again I didn't expect to see this at this price. There is also a USB outlet for wired charging.Overall I love this very functional stylish lamp and at this price it is a steal!Highly recommended, 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I have to share my excitement about this desk lamp I recently got. I was on the hunt for a lamp that ticked specific boxes for me: swiveling closed, LED, and a good light range. This lamp not only met my criteria but exceeded my expectations!To my astonishment, its Qi Charger managed to power up my wife's iPhone, even with her Oh Snap Otterbox and the magnet on\u2014a genuinely impressive feat! And yes, it charged our AirPods seamlessly too.The lighting options are versatile, offering multiple dim settings and temperatures. The controls are conveniently located on the base of the lamp and are super intuitive. The swivel feature is exceptional, directing light wherever needed. I've uploaded some photos taken at night, showcasing the contrast between the lamp's 'cool' illumination and the room's 'warm' ambiance.As you can see, all the controls are small impression pressure points on the base that react to what you need. It even has a '1-hour mode' which could be great as a forced 'study timeout', or reminder to go walk around and stretch.A bonus is the USB input on the base, perfect for an extra charge or powering a device. While it's USB-a and won't deliver fast charging, it's still a valuable feature for providing power.In conclusion, this lamp is a delightful discovery, and I can wholeheartedly endorse it. Imagine finding such a lamp by your hotel bed \u2013 what a treat that would be!",

There is a lot of adjustment range for the lamp arms but leaning it too far forward will tip it over.The lower arm adjusts from parallel with the desk to fully vertical and stays in place by friction only, there is no locking or friction adjustment system.The upper arm adjusts from parallel to the lower arm all the way to almost 180 degrees. It also stays in place by friction with no locking or friction adjustment system.Both of the arms on my unit stayed perfectly in place at all positions.The color temperature and brightness settings on this light are great features. I love the slide adjustment for brightness.The timer is a nice feature although I don't expect to ever use it.The wireless charger worked really well with my Samsung S23 Plus phone and had plenty of room to fit this or even larger phones. The target zone was larger than expected so the phone didn't need to land precisely in order to charge.The lower arm is about 14\" long and the upper arm is about 13\" long. The base is 7\" diameter and about 3/4\" thick.",
