                "reviewText": "I've been running my old and trusty IKEA compact fluorescent model desk lamp for over 2 decades!It just continues to soldier on and on. The thing is bulkier, and it does produce some heat off it that I can 'smell' due to the plastics surrounding it. It also consumes more power at 13W for its light output.After one utility power outage that lasted for many hours in the evening, I was forever sold on LED lighting fixtures for desks and personal space. Why? Because they mostly operate from 5VDC 2A wall warts. When we lost power, I was able to plug all these types of lights to my powerbanks and my home stayed illuminates as normal. What a big advantage! No more sitting in the dark with flashlights or candles.Enter the VERSKI LED multi-color temperature desk lamp. It looks identical in concept as my old IKEA lamp, the movable arms, desk clamp. But a sleek slender fresnel lens equipped head! AND 5VDC operation. When it arrived, I was impressed by the build quality and design. Very handsome light design. And easy to assemble and deploy. The quality of light, its choice, made the working environment more pleasing. I didn't know I needed it until I pulled the trigger to upgrade to LED. This lamp exceeded my expectations for quality and performance! Two thumbs up to VERSKI.What of the old IKEA? Perhaps relegate it to garage duty until it finally croaks!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Space saving, highly customizable",
                "reviewText": "This lamp attaches to the desk with a cushioned clamp, and takes up very little real estate on the desk surface. Visually, though, it is quite large and can reach over half the width of my desk, so if you're looking for something more subtle, this is not it; however, the modern/industrial aesthetic works well for my room, so I like it.The major pro of this lamp is that there five different spots on this lamp where you can adjust the tilt/angle, so if you are finicky about how you want your work space lit, this is the product for you. There are also 4 lighting modes, which can each be made brighter or dimmer. However, the downside is that the lamp does NOT remember the last setting you used. So, if you turn it on night light mode because your partner is sleeping, but then you turn it off and then back on, it can be a little shocking. That's why I docked one star. It would have been better to either design this lamp to remember your last setting or make the first setting the dimmest mode before you cycle to the brighter modes.The indicator light on the switch is also quite bright and can interfere with sleep, but there is actually a way to toggle that off, which is a thoughtful design touch. The lamp does not feel noticeably hot after use, which is also very nice.All in all, with the minor exception of not remembering your last setting, this lamp is well-designed, looks good, and is a pleasure to use.",

                "reviewText": "My desk isn't large with all the other monitors and risers that I have situated so I needed a LED lamp that was clamp-form. This one is so well-built, takes up barely any space and offers plenty of light coverage. I'm glad it offers multiple color hues as I prefer warm-white and I love how I can easily fold away if I don't want to use it. As for aesthetics, I don't think it's the best looking lamp because the body is multi-folds/zig zag like but it's functional. It's a great desk lamp and saves desk space.",

                "reviewText": "This light looks sharp! It comes well packaged and is very easy to set up. It is made with an obvious attention to detail. It moves with smoothness, swivels, bends, and holds its position to shine light wherever you need it. Not only that, but you can change the temperature of the lamp and choose the brightness. The one other thing I want to mention is that it fades on/off. That was a surprise, and it really adds such a nice touch. This really feels like a very expensive light. I love it!!",

I appreciate the multiple settings, especially the one that creates a softer and more natural light. This was easy to install on my desk, and it gets used every day. If there was one thing I would change, and it doesn't even require the loss of a star, would be to move the switch mechanism onto the arm so it doesn't dangle off the edge of the desk.",
