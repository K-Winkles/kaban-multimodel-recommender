But the switch is the worst piece of engineering I've ever seen! It uses touch sensitive switches on an integrated circuit but has 1/8 inch of plastic on the cover. unless the temperature of the room and your hand are hot enough the switch just doesn't work at all. It is December in Kansas and I had to hold my finger on the power switch for 20 seconds before anything happened. The mode switch would not work at all and then I couldn't turn it off or back on after unplugging. I'm a DIY guy so I popped the switch cover off and tested the switches and everything works just fine. After drilling holes in the cover and stilling having issues I just decided to keep the back half and use electrical tape to cover everything but the touch pads on the circuit board. Now it works as advertised. Would have been a 4 or even 5 star review if the switch wasn't so bad. As it is, don't buy this unless you live in a warm climate year round or you want to do what I did. Who tested this thing?",

The switch is not on the lamp head but on the cord, which is quite inconvenient, but worse, it is a touch-switch and a weird one to boot! It shuts itself off at irregular intervals and it does not remember the color setting. On the plus side, the light is even, bright and very adjustable, but still, dang annoying switch so I am returning it!A week later: I owe the company an apology. I had connected the lamp to a dimmer which clearly interfered with the lamp's touch switch. While the location of the cord mounted switch is still irritating, it does work pretty decent once you get used to it - and it does revert to the setting it had before turning it off.",
