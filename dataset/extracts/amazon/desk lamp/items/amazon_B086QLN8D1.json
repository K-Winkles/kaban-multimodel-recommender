Im a nail tech and, well, it did the job! It fit nicely on my desk, folded up, was sturdy, nice and bright, and just a good little lamp. Only downside is it randomly shut off one day and wouldn't turn back on. Not bad for what I paid! Just frustrating that I now have to buy a new one!",

                "reviewText": "The light was delivered in a reasonable amoun tof time and was packaged safely.The brightness is somewhat adjustable from dim to its brightest via a touch panel on the light's base. That toush panel as well as all the other controls, is not an array of protruding switches, but a capacitive toush system. There's a touch location for On/OFF, for a few different automatic OFF settings and one to change the light from flourescent to incandescent modes. There's more than one different shades of the incandescent look.The light looks nice and the stand holds the light in place well. The light swivels and adjusts in 3 directions while the stand can remain in the place where set by the user.I bought the light to put where I tie fly baits. It helps me see better. There's times I think I want the light to be a little brighter, but my eyes don't work as well some days as they work on other days. Oh well.The timer mode sometimes catches me by surprise because it turns the light off automatically after an amount of time dependent on how the timer is set. I can't designate which exact button pushes control the different functions, but that's likely detailed in the instructions. I only read enough of the instructions to get the light on and off.The light runs via a USB wall wart. There's no internal battery that I can tell. There's 2 USB receptacles on the back of the base. I'm running the light with the USB C connector plugged into the base. The other USB receptacle is USB A.So far I'm happy with the light. If I see the need I'd buy an additional one - or - more.",

It also has a USB port for charging your phone which is nice and works great. Provide swivels so you can move the light where you want without having to move the base. There is a timer for how long do you want to keep the light on as well as gymnast and brightness options. They thought of a lot of nice options and extras with this light. Very pleased with my purchase.",
