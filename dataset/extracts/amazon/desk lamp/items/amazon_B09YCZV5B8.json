                "reviewText": "I needed a lamp to put on a dresser to give more light in my craft room. I wanted something small but which threw a lot of light. This lamp almost does the trick. It's a lovely little light and the 3-way bulb is pretty bright, but not quite enough for my needs. However, the lamp came with a card inside that said if the bulb wasn't bright enough, they'd send a brighter one (!) if requested. I emailed the compny and got a very quick response saying they had shipped a new bulb and even sent a copy of the shipping label with the tracking number (5 stars+ for customer service!!!). The touch feature works nicely (soft light at first touch and brighter for each of 2 more taps, then touch to turn off. The simulated wood base is very pretty and the lamp is well made with an attractive, quality shade. Just one note: follow the instructions for putting the shade on. I tried doing it without reading at first and the shade was very wobbly. When I followed the easy instructions, it was very stable and looked great. I probably won't need to use the charging ports or the A/C plug in the base much, but they are unintrusive and a nice-to-have, if needed. I'll update regarding the new bulb when it arrives. I've already received a USPS notification that it will arrive in 2 days (it's currently the weekend) - so, again, 5 stars+ for GREAT service from this company!",

                "reviewText": "This lamp is very pretty, sturdy, and versatile. In the wood-look base (it\u2019s actually metal) with linen shade it is perfect with every decor. Love the touch switch, which works to set the bulb (included) to 3 brightness levels with just a tap of your finger on the base or neck of the lamp. Bulb stays cool even if it\u2019s on for hours. The lamp came packaged carefully and unboxing it and performing the minimal assembly is very simple. The company will ship a free extra bulb if you prefer one of three choices they offer for a cooler brightness. Instructions to obtain another free bulb are included with the assembly booklet.I bought this lamp to be a bedside light in my small guest bedroom. It lights more than sufficiently for a reading light and has a warm illumination at all 3 levels. The bulb is dimmable and will work with a smart outlet, too. The base of the lamp solves the need to provide a guest with a phone or tablet charging outlet. A USB-A and a USB-C port are built right into the base. Either port will take an appropriate charger cable. There is also a fully functional 110v AC outlet in the lamp base. I tested all 3 receptacles and they all work perfectly. Lights, charging ports and an electric outlet all in one pretty lamp. Irresistible value.The lamp comes with a lifetime guarantee and customer service is friendly and helpful. The lamp is flawless. Pick the base & shade you like best and order it. You\u2019ll find it useful and of very good quality.",
