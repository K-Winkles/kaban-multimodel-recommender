                "reviewText": "Edit: I recently realized the wobble was because I hadn\u2019t completely tightened the base components. The swivel is now stable and does not wobble when moved. I\u2019ve upped my review to 5 stars as a result. It\u2019s still not going to compare to true top of the line hobby lamps and the range of motion is still fairly limited, but what you get versus what you pay, it is 100% worth it and worthy of that rating.I bought this for a desk lamp for working on plastic hobby miniatures. The light variations are quite nice, allowing for intensity and warmth options. It\u2019s not very precise spectrum or intensity controls but for a lamp under $30 it\u2019s pretty impressive. Two things to be aware of, it only folds along one axis and the joints, both the folding arm and the twisting base joints, are not the greatest. The swivel is a little wobbly and the arms are stiff and have odd limits on the range of motion. I knew about the limitations for the most part based on the pictures, but I was a little surprised how limited it really was. All in all, if you are ok with it being a decidedly cheap lamp with limited angles, it\u2019s utterly fantastic for small hobbies on a budget. Just don\u2019t expect it to do everything a more expensive one would.",

                "reviewText": "I have this light next to my bed for years now. Things I like about it: 4 different settings- can adjust lighting brighter or dimmer within one of the settings- 60 minute auto off setting - flexible range and now with the usb port. The one I have keeps changing settings on its own so I decided it\u2019s time for a new one\u2026one for bedside and another for my desk. When I tried to search for a simple lamp the cost was way more than this one. I found this one by looking at my shopping history. The rating is still as decent as the lamp itself. For $20 you can\u2019t go wrong. Highly recommend.UPDATE: how does someone have a lamp right next to their bed for six years and never notice it has a usb port!?! (Raising hand)",

                "reviewText": "The first thing that surprised me was the heftyness of the base, I was expecting something lightweight and cheap feeling. The base was very solid and had more weight than I thought, there's no worry about this thing falling over or being unstable. The next thing was the brightness. I had picked this up primarily to be a quick solution to lighting when I was working on tabletop miniatures, this thing is a lot brighter than I thought at the highest settings and it's a lot better than I figured it would be for the price. This is certainly worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 09/26/2015UPDATE 09/26/2015This lamp is actually excellent for a crafter or someone who sews. I actually bought this for artwork, painting and drawing, and it ust does not light up enough of an area and that is because only 530 lumens. BUT, I now own two. Gave one to Mom for crochet and then months later realized perfect with my sewing machine, I have a Singer computerized 8780 and it has a really small light. This has a small footprint and you can move it in any direction in order to get the light where you need it.Now, I would NEVER pay $150 for it, but I was able to buy both here on AMAZON for $50 each or a little less. Plus you get free shipping.__________________________11/10/2014 REVISED:Taking this back up to 4 stars as I have given this lamp to my Mom for her to have a good light when crocheting. She LOOOOOVES this lamp. For her it lights up with enough clarity for her to see her work even when using dark and black yarn. She is 84 and wears bifocals so for her she is very pleased. The one hour timer also reminds her to take a break every hour to let her mind rest, which she needs due to a brain injury, so that is very helpful for that, if she remembers to turn the timer on (LOL).BUT, I still would not pay more for the lamp that I did, which I think was about $30 and I have seen these on line and in stores for over $100 which is just stupid as it is cheap plastic and does NOT light up a large area. Also, it is a strand of itsy bitsy lights and not one powerful bulb, so there is NOT an accumulated brightness by number of lights as they would have you believe, so only 520 Lumens.Works for Mom, not for me.__________________________08/03/2014 REVISEDTaking down to 3 stars from 4 now that I used it since it lights up only a small area at 530 LUMENS. Not a good lamp for artwork, but good by bed or as a study lamp only. Would not pay over $30 if needing replacement. I will instead buy an adjustable arm lamp that can take any kind of bulb and buy bulbs instead and swap them out. You can buy a bulb up to 2,800 lumens and 5,000 - 6,500 Kelvins for about $9 or less if on sale and it will light up my whole desk. I doubt this lamp is at 6,000 Kelvins ait's brightest as it is not as bright as my lamp with an actual bulb at 5,500 Kelvins, but not a scientific fact, just as seen through my eyes.-----------------------------------Lots to say, will try to make it short... Bottom Line If this lamp is $40 or under I would buy it, but not for much more than that because of the Lumen Rating of 530, the only saving grace is the CRI rating of 90+ which is why I am keeping it but also keeping the box it came in, in case it breaks down.I am going to discuss it from an artists' point of view. For us \"true\" light, like the light outside is what we need when doing artwork indoors and to be able to see actual true color of color and shades. But first about the price and who is selling it, I paid $32.99. YES ONLY $32.99!! Also to note, I bought and returned the lamp by JEBSEN, the A2 listed @ $140 and priced at $32, which is a joke, because it was really small, lit a small area and was not very bright and cheap feeling, and decided on this lamp over the JEBSEN A4 larger one listed at $140 and selling for $50.This lamp is sold by numerous vendors on AMAZON with prices from the $32.99 to a list price of $280!!! AND IT IS THE SAME LAMP, just stamped with a different name as in:Diasonic DL-91H $130 - $165Softech $99Softech $90Tao Tronics Elune TT-DL02 $65, list $199Cocoweb Smart TT-DL01 $49Lampat $50Let me also say that there is NO WAY I would EVER pay any of those prices, it's worth no more than $50 due to cheap plastic housing. You can check other vendors as it is the EXACT same lamp and also comes in white. One drawback is I do not think you can swap out the bulbs, so when it dies you need to buy an entire lamp again and about 20% of the buyers complained it breaks or quits working within the first few months.About Light:Looking for natural lighting you need to look at Lumens and CRI. I will not use WATTS which is the amount of energy the lamp uses and is NOT about how bright something is, or the term RADIANCE which is how much energy it emits.CRI is Color Rendering, how well you can see the actual color of things with 0 being the worst and 100 highest. Most bulbs rate at 70-80. You want 90+ to see actual color of things and medium used as in paint or coloured pencils. This lamp is rated at 90+ which so, it is has a VERY GOOD CRI rating and the ONLY reason I am keeping it.LUMENS is how bright the light actually is and how much it will light up an area. One lumen is equal to the amount of light a candle lets fall on 1 square foot of area, 1 foot away. So to gauge this consider that a 60-watt incandescent light bulb produces 890 lumens, which is soft home lighting. A 75 watt bulb =1,200L and 100w =1,700L and 150w = 2,850L. 1,000L is a typical overcast day outside so you always want something at 1,000 or more when working. Description states this is brighter than a 120W regular bulb which is bright but NOT TRUE!!!IT ONLY HAS 530 LUMENS<<< which is really, really low and less than a 60 WATT regular light bulb. This makes no sense to me whatsoever, they went through all the trouble and expense on CRI and Kelvin ratings and totally dropped the ball on how much this light will illuminate!KELVINS is the type of light being produced, as in cool or warm. It is measured in 1,000's. The lower the number the warmer the light emitted and the higher the number up to around 7,500K the cooler the light, with Daylight at Noon at around 5,000K. Fluorescent and LED's range between 2,700K - 6,500K, maybe a little more.PURE WHITE: 6K - 6,500DAYLIGHT WHITE: 5k - 5,500WARM WHITE: 4k - 4,500YELLOW LIGHT: 3k - 3,500The lamp has a total of 27 small LED bulbs in 9 rows, 18 white/9 warm; lots of separate lights = multiple shadows depending on the alignment of the lamp to your work, so consideration must be given to the shadow casts on fine details of an artists' work in progress (drawing or painting). It is a good sized lamp standing 18\" tall and 14\" long, with the ability to move in most directions and up and down. It remembers the setting at each type of light as long as you do not unplug it, if you do it resets to level 3 on all light types.This lamp has a total of 20 settings, 4 different types of light and 5 strength settings within each type. I need at least 5K or more and the ability to light up my entire desk. The breakdowns of the types of light are:1. Study Mode: 6000K-7000K, PURE WHITE, COLD LIGHT - increases attention & concentration, high range color temperature, blueish in tone as 18 white LED's are at 100% and the warm at around 50%.2. Reading Mode: 4300K-5300K, DAYLIGHT/NATURAL LIGHT - stimulates concentration & reduces eye strain and is within the mid-range color. ALL bulbs are used and while the Kelvins are lower than \"Study Mode\" it is the BRIGHTEST MODE to the eye and the one I use the most.3. Relaxation Mode: 2500K-3300K, YELLOW, WARM LIGHT - promotes relaxation & improved mood with low-range color temperature. The warmer lights are at 100% and the white lights at 50%. Good for flipping through a magazine or reading in bed.4. Bedtime Mode: 2500K-3300K: YELLOW, - encourages a deep sleep with comfortable soft light, only the warm coloured LED's are used. More of a nightlight or if you wake up it will not strain your eyes or make you squint turning it on.But, for any large pieces of art I either need a different lamp or 2 lamps, one on each side to light up my work space properly.I also bought natural light bulbs for my other lamp to try. The bulbs were expensive at around $8 but I think well worth it. Also, it is a great way to decide on what light you like to work by and try out different types of light before investing in an actual lamp. The bulb I bought comes in two types listed below and both work well:GE Lighting 71765 Energy Smart Spiral CFL 26-Watt (100-watt replacement) 5,000K, Natural outdoor light Medium base, Shape T3 1600 LumensGE Lighting 89095 Energy Spiral CFL 26-Watt (100-watt replacement) 6,500K Daylight/sunlight Medium base, Shape T3 1660 LumensSo, for me this was a somewhat great lamp at a great price and I probably got the last one at the $32.99. Would I pay $100 or more for it? NO WAY!!! I would rather buy more bulbs to try out with a regular housing lamp like the one I already had.Also, buy only from AMAZON or if fulfilled by AMAZON because if there are issues they take care of you, regardless. Most other vendors just ignore you if your item falls apart after the return window is closed, which does happen all the time with products. So, just make sure to use AMAZON!!!If this lamp is $40 or under I would buy it, but not for much more than that because of the Lumen Rating, the only saving grace is the CRI rating which is why I am keeping it but also keeping the box it came in, in case I send it back if it breaks down.

There are 4 different shades, and within each shade there are 5 different brightness settings. There is also a 60 minute timer on it and the whole interface is sleek and only requires a simple touch to change. The wire it comes with is long in case your outlet is a bit far away. It's a great product in my opinion.",
