I love the adjustable touch control with three brightness shades and the ability to adjust the lamps to different heights and angles. The finish and overall design is beautiful. HOWEVER, the two lamps recently ordered were received on 2/19/2023. Today is 5/5/2023 and one of the lamps is no longer functioning properly- the light is very dim. Apparently we cannot exchange the bulbs as these are meant to last for a very long time. I don't know how to go about returning it since it is beyond the Amazon return period. I'd simply like a replacement. Now I'm stuck.",

The swivel joints dont lock very well because the short handles dont allow one to tighten the joint very well when just using the hand so that the lamp can droop from its desired setting. A pair of pliers are needed to adequately tighten the joint. The soft light is perfect for a ready lamp.",
