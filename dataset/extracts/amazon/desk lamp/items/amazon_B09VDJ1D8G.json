Now i have two in use and a third being given for Christmas. Some Pros: Long reach when extended out. Multiple joints provide lots of positioning options. Swivel light head allows you to shine the light up/down exactly where you need it. Light on/off switch has a soft blue glow when the light is off, easy to find in the dark Enough brightness settings many environments. Clamp mount is large and solid, works well. Light stays cool to the touch. Some Cons Power/settings control is in-line with the power cable so you have to accommodate cord routing. Would prefer to have controls on top of the light assemble. The base is solid, but will tip over with the light fully extended or while extending the light.",

                "reviewText": "I tried three of a different LED desk lamp and they all three failed within three to five months. All of them. So, I started looking for something else and saw this one. It is big. It isn't for a small desk, but it is so versatile in positioning that it functions as a desk lamp when I need it and I can swivel the light 180 degrees upwards and have indirect light in the office. I like the three light temperatures of cool, daylight and warm. I use the warm color temperature in the afternoons and evenings to keep my exposure to blue light down and promote better sleep. I like the daylight color temperature during the morning and midday to keep me awake. There are ten light levels, down to night-light level. This is one sweet lamp. The lamp mounts to a clamp or a weighted base, both included. The tensor springs allow for a plethora of positioning and keep the lamp pretty much where it's placed. Now, it isn't a swivel lamp, so movements are linear, but there is so much light put out by this lamp, even getting \"near\" to perfect placement is perfect. Like I said, in the headline, I want two more, so that is what I am ordering next.",
