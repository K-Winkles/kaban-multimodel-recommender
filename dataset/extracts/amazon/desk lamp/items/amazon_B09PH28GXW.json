It\u2019s got three different types of light, so it\u2019s very versatile. I personally like a very warm light and this has it. It also has a dimmer and USB ports which makes it really handy. It adjusts so that he can hover right above the table top, meaning that I don\u2019t have to see the light source from the light itself. I just lower the light arm so that it\u2019s about 6 inches above the table top and I don\u2019t see the light source, but it gives me great light on my surface. Pretty good light!",
