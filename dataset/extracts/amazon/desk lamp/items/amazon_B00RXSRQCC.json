                "reviewText": "Fantastic. Very good quality. Perfect for so many uses. Reasonable price and I would recommend it to anyone.I read some negative reviews and the issue is that at one time this was a different fixture. If you got the old onewith an external clamp, I feel your pain. I got the new one which looks exactly like the picture shown and isvery high quality. I bought a second one just recently because I like it so much.Assembly is simple:1] Install two springs by hooking one end of the spring over the bottom spring holder (located on the bottom partof the upper arm), then stretch the spring and hook it over the top spring holder (located on the top partof the upper arm) and release to create tension. There are two springs, so do this for both the right and left sidesof the upper arm.2] Unscrew the clamping screw from the bottom stem of the lamp, then screw it back in place with the lamp stemattached to the base stem.3] Install the lamp cover by matching the beveled slots, insert 1/2 inch then rotate clockwise 1/2 inch.The lamp shade locks in place and can be removed at any time by reversing that operation.I put a 100 watt equivalent LED lamp in one and a 60 watt equivalent LED in the other one. I have alsoput an LED grow light in one for a while to start my baby herbs and pepper plants. This fixture will holdpretty much anything you want to put in it, but if the lamp is large and/or omnidirectional, you may omitthe lamp cover/shade.My 100 watt LED bulb is 17w 120vac 60Hz 136mA 1600 lumens and is UL Listed.You could put an old analog light bulb in it, but I would stay at 40 watts or below. You could also put a CFLbulb in it, but I would stay at 60 watts or below, 75 watts being the upper limit. I suggest LED bulbs.The socket is called A19 in the United States (metric A60 for European), which I believe is the most common socket.CFL or Compact Florescent Lamp is the \"curly cue\" \"new bulb\" that replaces the old incandescent light bulb.I do not recommend those because if they break (and they do) they have harmful chemicals in them. If you usethis light where children or animals can be, I would not suggest using CFL bulbs. LEDs are the \"new bulbs\" notCFL. CFL was a temporary solution to a bigger problem. LEDs are a better solution.Some people complain that LED light is artificial, but the technology is getting better, so be on the lookout forbetter more natural light producing LEDs. Also, the cost is higher, but they last much longer, so in the long runyou get more bang for your buck.",

If your eyesiy is poor and your hands are weak, you'll need some help aligning one little screw at the bottom and.stretching and attaching the upper springs. The description accurately states that the thing is heavy duty. It takes a standard Edison base bulb.. I'm using a 40 watt equivalent LED bulb and it's total overkill.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good with a few quirks.",
                "reviewText": "Okay, not to be a pessimist but I'm going to start with the negatives.1) Swivel is extremely limited after inserting base screw and you have to lift up the arm part a bit to get the screw in which makes it feel like it's not all the way down sitting firmly on the base, it just doesn't feel fully stable or functional at the piece where the base plate meets the arm. It doesn't greatly detract from the lamp if you're not planning to swivel it though.2) The lamp head is pretty loose even after tightening the screw quite a bit...it holds its place well enough but still droops a few mm's when I let go. I'm afraid to keep tightening as I don't want to break it. Not the biggest deal if you don't plan on adjusting the head a lot.3) When it came it had 2 (seemingly unnecessary) screws in the bottom hinge for some reason, this completely prevented the bottom hinge from moving at all, essentially stripping it's ability to 'swing', which kind of defeats the purpose of the lamp. After removing these two screws you gain the ability to swing the bottom hinge, restoring functionality, as long as you don't tilt it too forward or else it falls over. Not really a fault of the lamp, you can only expect it to go so far forward before physics takes over and tips it. But, yea, why the hell are those screws there? What am I missing?http://imgur.com/rjk3C2nAs you can see if you leave the one screw in it's right in the path of any movement, and the other screw actually goes right into one of the bars.Positives:1) Value of the lamp, it's quite tall and pretty nice looking for 20$.2) Looks nice and functions well enough and feels pretty solid, none of the negatives were really game changing, more like little annoyances.Neutral;1) Kind of wish it came with both a base plate and a desk clamp, I don't imagine that would add much to the price and would be nice to have. Not faulting the product at all for this though given its price.So yea, I'm rating this 4/5. Would consider lowering the rating if any of the negatives mentioned become a serious problem in the future, although that doesn't seem too likely.",

My kids use this also to project more light for their on-line classes behind their camera. They also use it for their reading lamp on their bedside table. The only thing to caution you is that the light does warm up and feels hot to the touch. It is not hot on the on and off button or not hot if pushing it by the stand but just where the light shade that heats up to be quite hot. It is an affordable price and yet not made cheaply.",

                "reviewText": "I decided I wanted a goose neck/swing arm desk lamp for reading, just like the two I had for 30 years. I had specifically wanted 1. the span or reach of the light away from the base, 2. the on/off switch on the light part and not the base, 3. the on/off knob or switch to be a small twisty knob and not those large dome shaped ones (I burned my fingers on that type), and 4. use regular light bulbs. The bonus was it came in pink too! So I unpack my spiffy new lamp, but it's not quite the same as previous models. I discover that there is a pin added to the bottom section of the arm, meaning it will not move, meaning I can't extend the upper lamp very far at all, because I can't lower the lower arm. Hmmm. But I am a swing arm lamp expert now, and I suspect that the manufacturers had to deal with people that overextended the arm/light of the lamp and it toppled over. So this pin was put in to prevent that, BUT it also ruined the spanning option of the lamp. I took the pin out easy with a screwdriver and now I have the lamp I wanted. Note that yes you can topple this with a full extension, but that's physics for ya, can only get so much weight in the base. I like my new lamp.",
