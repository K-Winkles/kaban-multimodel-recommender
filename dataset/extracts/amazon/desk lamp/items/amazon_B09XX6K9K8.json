It makes a nice even light all across my work area.When I want to work on the laptop, I just push the vanes down so the light doesn't reflect off the screen, but I still have plenty of diffuse light to see my keyboard.When I go to sleep, I adjust the brightness to the lowest level and fold up the vanes all the way before I turn it off. In the morning when it is still dark, I just turn on the light and it is so dim, it doesn't hurt my eyes, but I can see to find my glasses and other things, and as my eyes adjust, I turn it brighter.I keep it on the warmest light setting, which makes it as pleasant as an incandescent light. There is no flicker at all -- other LED lights I've used have flicker that bothers me, but not this one.I would give it ten stars if there were that many.",
