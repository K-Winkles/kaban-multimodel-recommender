                "reviewText": "The marketing material needs to be a little clearer on whether or not a power converter is included. While with many low voltage products like this, I have extra power converters that will work. This light needs a 10.5W power supply... which is larger than most phone, tablets, etc. need.The on-off switch is too close to the lamp base. I have this lamb behind two monitors, a power strip and misc. other items on my desk. I have to reach through and under all of that to get to the switch.Other than those two MINOR inconveniences, I really like this lamp. Plenty of light, versatile and works great so far.",

The colors of light allow for a white blueish or warm light tone. And has multiple light levels for your eye comfort I need bright light and this meets that need. It's a very good value .NOTE if you do not have a USB type A plug buy the version with the adapter. Also note the cord is not extremely long so you'll need a plug within about 5 feet unless your plugging into a USB port on a device. I recommend this product",
