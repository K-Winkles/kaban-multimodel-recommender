                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent bang for buck, AWESOME Fish Tank Light!",
                "reviewText": "I recently just purchased a second one. I have it mounted as a bed lamp. The first, I purchased to light my fish tank. My apartment doesn't have the best lighting, where I had to set up my tank. Which made it so that my fish were not seeing all of the food, and then it was going to waste. These lamps are REALLY GREAT. They are a really good, really well working design. The controls are very simple, and easy to figure out. I love it that the power switch is backlit when not turned on. That helps TREMENDOUSLY when trying to find the power switch. I really like that it has dimming capability, to make the light brighter, or less bright. This is great, because I can turn it down, and not worry about hurting my own, or my fish's eyesight. You can also change it between white, or a yellowish light. Which is very nice, if somebody is sensitive to a white light. The adjustable neck on these are quite long. With the head bent over, it will clear 25 inches of height. This lets me put the lamp quite a bit above my tank. It also means that it would clear the top of a larger tank, as well. There is also a screw in the base, that will let you lower the neck down, and then secure it lower, if the neck is too long for what you need. The base is sturdy. I kind of wish that there was a rubber or felt pad on the clamp, and on the underside of the base. It would help to protect the furniture, and give the base more grip on the surface of what it's clamped to. While the vice action of the lamp is metal, the base is plastic. So just keep that in mind too. The base does hold quite securely. The one in my room is attached to a 1/2 inch ledge. Which does NOT appear to be secure at all. But, I tested, and it's not easy for me to knock it loose. The neck is thick, solid, and (please forgive me) quite robust. When you get it where you want it, it stays there. Doesn't droop (as long as your base is secured well) and is easy to re-angle or bring around to another place, if you want/need to. The one that I have over my bed works really well. I have it so that I don't have it glaring off of my laptop screen, with a medium light, in yellow mode. I'm really quite pleased with that. But... I'm not a light sensitive sleeper. I've fallen asleep with it on, twice now. (Oh my light bill!!! LOL) This is a great design, quality is much better for what you expect at it's price. And it's pricepoint makes it an overall GREAT value. Bang for the buck. Serious bang for the buck. I highly recommend this product, and yes... I will be buying again! I like that they went with a USB type B connector and wall plug design. It makes it quite versatile. Particularly for those of us that prefer USB ports which don't block other holes in the surge protector. I plan on getting a third one for a work bench light, as soon as I start getting tools and a workbench.",

                "reviewText": "Wow, this light is nice and bright on the highest setting, and it looks just like the pictures. It comes with a usb adapter. The neck part is long, sturdy and flexible so you can bend it down low or high. When set the neck straight to test out how bright it was I was amazed that it almost lit up the whole room, the room is about 200sq feet. I am going to get another one. It is only 10 watts so it is a great way to save money while working and keep your home cool in the summer. It also has settings where you can change the light to a warm color and also dim the light down, after a while I dimmed the light lower during the evenings. I am really happy with this light, it is such good quality.",

It does overheat after a while of use but that's to be expected since it's a plug in light, overall great product and highly recommend for beginner nail techs or just as a casual overhead lamp.",
