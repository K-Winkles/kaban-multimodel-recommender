Firstly, these lights are able to produce soft non-flickering light which is easier on the eyes and reduces eye strain. Secondly, they offer anti-glare properties which make them ideal for use in a variety of settings, including offices, homes, and public spaces. Thirdly, high CRI LED lights are able to accurately present color, ensuring that users are able to see colors as they should be seen. Fourthly, high CRI LED lights are able to produce light that is close to natural light, which can enhance the overall look and feel of a space. Finally, high CRI LED lights emit less blue light, which can help to reduce the negative impacts of blue light on human health. Overall, LED lights with high CRI are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality lighting that is both effective and efficient.",

I was really happy about this because I really wanted to use this light on my desk and it fit nicely over my 35\" ultrawide. Its in place and so far so good. Once I use it for a while Ill update this post, but was impressed with the customer service the seller provided._____Today when I initially installed this light I realized how stiff the joints were to move, but the material it\u2019s made out of isn\u2019t very durable. It\u2019s made from some cheap metal and plastic so you will need to be gentle moving the head around. I have a 35\u201d curved ultrawide on an expensive desk mounted stand/arm, which brings it up to about 8\u201d from the desk. This light fits/hovers over the top of the monitor without any issues. Using the monitor light is another story though. It appears that it so cheaply made that If you moved it around too much. It doesn\u2019t look like it would last very long. So I took it off my desk until I flip my desk around where my monitor would be stationary, then I was going to reinstall it again. After taking the light down I realized how cheap the screw base was and grabbed my camera to take a picture when the swivel thing that help secure it to the desk, broke off the torque screw! Talk about something cheaply made! Without that piece attached to the screw this lamp is pretty much useless because it can\u2019t stand up! Prior to that the light was nice and bright and could change the color hue of the lights, now it\u2019s just a $45 piece of junk!",

The arms of the light branches, and curse, so it is even suitable for curved monitors. There are many settings for the color temperature of the lamp so you can go from cool to warm in a few taps. There is also button that is marked \"A\", and it autocorrects for light, bright and dark light presets. Construction is sturdy and the light is diffuse. It is also very easy to use. I highly recommend this monitor lamp!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This LED desk light lights up a wide area of desk work space without shining in your eyes. There are 5 levels of brightness and color temperature to choose from with the touch of a button or you can long-hold the same button for a faster change of lighting levels.It has a nice, slim-lined, narrow design and, because it is mounted to the desk with a screw on clamp, it's pretty sturdy and it takes up very little desk space. I like being able to quickly and easily change lighting angles and width of exposure with one or both of the overhead arms, which can independently swing 270 degrees forward and back. Both side arms can also be moved together, as a unit, from the head mount of the lamp or upwards and downwards using the rear height adjusting arm.",
