The controls are intuitive and clearly labeled.The only real problem I have with the lamp is that its very easy to adjust the lamp while placing/picking up your phone. Keep that in mind if you intend to be constantly placing/picking up the phone. It works well if you need to get in a charge but it doesnt work super great if you're constantly touching it. It's very easy to adjust the brightness because of the position of the sliding touchpad for adjusting the brightness.I also wanted to note that it charges my iphone well with its thinner case but my workphone has an otterbox on it and it's too thick to properly charger the phone while other charges will, such as my Anker charger.",

                "reviewText": "The lamp works well as a task light or small desk lamp. The leds are not super bright, but bright enough for most purposes. The instructions are not great, but have enough information to figure out the shut off timer, brightness and color functions. The controls are on the lamp base and are easy to inadvertently touch. That said, it is easy enough to readjust. The light boom is flexible and has adequate adjustments to position the light over your work. Overall a good lamp and a good value for the money.",

The adjustable brightness is great and can be changed with a swipe motion. The cordless charging feature also works great with our iPhones. My favorite part though is that the coolness and warmth of the lamp can also be adjusted. Since my husband tends to study in the evenings, it\u2019s nice to be able to turn on a warmer setting so the light is more amber, instead of a blue hue white light. So much easier on the eyes. Plus it\u2019s great that it doesn\u2019t take a lot of desk space and looks pretty modern. We\u2019ve had it just shy of a week, but so far, two thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",

I like its max brightness and brightness control, ability to control the light color, and the ability to put the light in almost any position. 5 stars as a desk light.The charging works OK. You need to place the phone fairly precisely, but I don't think that's a big deal. You quickly come to know where to put your phone so that it charges, and there's a little green light that comes on to tell you that it's charging (I don't think that information is in the minimal manual the manufacturer provides). For just charging, I'd give it 4 stars.It's when you combine using it as a charger with wanting a bright light that it falls just a little short. It comes with a 3.0 quick charger, which works, but unfortunately its power is marginal when asked to do both quick charging of a phone and power the light at full brightness. The brightness of the lamp fluctuates at random. You can generally get it to go back up to max, but it still tends to fluctuate a bit. And I've occasionally observed the charging to shut off when the phone is not fully charged. When it does, the only indication (other than whatever your phone provides as an indication) is that the little green light starts flashing. I guess this means \"the phone is on the charger but not currently charging\", but again, that's not in the manual. So as a combined wireless charger/light, I'd give it 3.5 or 4 stars. The fluctuations in the light are annoying, but it's not something that disqualifies it, for me.This issue may be break-in related. I seem to be noticing the problem a little less now than I did on day 1 (I've had it for 4 days now). Anyway, for now it's 4 stars overall. Perhaps I'll update this after more time has gone by.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this lamp with high hopes for my office because I could not stand the overhead light for the life of me. This lamp lit my office up without giving me a headache. I was able to decrease the amount of cluttered cords on my desk because I rarely needed a usb charger. I typically would charge my phone and my watch at the same time with this lamp. My only complaint is the charge is slow and finicky with this cases and android phones. The slender design was perfect for me to maximize my desk space. Many of my coworkers ended up purchasing this lamp, too. They loved it as much as I do. Since I quit my last job in January 2022, I put it to use in my living room. We don't need any other lamps.",

Had to use duct tape to keep it set in one position. Don't be sold about the multi-positioning aspect, or it shall be the same for you. Loosens up and won't stay the same way. The nice things I can still say about it are the USB extension port, various white light colors, and the dimming/brightening feature. The charging plate was always a bit slow for my phone, but really not necessary for me.",
