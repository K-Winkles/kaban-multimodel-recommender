Although the lack of a wall adapter is not a huge deal, it is an inconvenience because I don't have a spare and have to borrow one that's already in use to try the lamp out and will ultimately have to buy one at the store. Extra cost and inconvenience knocks one star off.",

                "reviewText": "Item arrived quick and on time. Packaged well. And easy to set up. It has a typical screw clamp to secure light to work table or bench. My work table is about 1/2 inch to 1inch thickness and this clamp has plenty of room to secure it tightly to my table. On the top of the table clamp is the first joint of the first length of extension. At this joint you have the capability of rotating the entire lamp in a 360 degree circle around my work space and a good size wing screw that will lock the swivel into place so it won\u2019t move once it\u2019s in place. This joint also allows me to raise or lower the arm. The second leg of the lamp allows for raising and lowering even more but again no way to lock it in position. This leg also holds the on and off button along with the slider for intensity or brightness desired. It runs along the entire top of the leg of this extension. The light itself is a third extension and again can move up or down but again no way to lock it in place. The only issue I have is if I have all 3 extensions are extended completely out and I lower it too low it does not have enough tension to hold the light up off my workspace. But that doesn\u2019t bother me as I simply re clamp the light closer to my work which eliminates that issue. As an older man who needs readers to read and focus on intricate details I need good lighting that focuses on area I\u2019m working on. This light does the trick and am completely happy with my purchase.",

No outlets will make it run, died 3 days outside of my return window.--------------------------------Updated Review --The company saw my plight on here after my first lamp died only a few days outside of the return window and they essentially overnighted me a new lamp for free. It arrived the same as two-day shipping, and this one seems firmer. I did not ask for a refund or replacement, but they reached out to me and offered it. That is cool first of all.Second, I think my first one just had something wonky with it because the new one out of the package is already better. Better machined hinge movement, feels more expensive than the first, more receptive to touch on the digital display this time. Maybe its just my mind making me think that, but its definitely a decent product for the cost. Hopefully this one last a long time!",

                "reviewText": "The lamp head is 11.5\" long. The control arm is 14.5\" long. The split arm (closest to the clamp) is 16\" long. My plan was to extend it from a shelf to my computer, hovering over my desk and freeing up desk space. A clearly-written instruction manual comes with it, and the controls are intuitive and easy to work. Slide your finger up or down the control panel to get the brightness/temperature you want. And it will remember the last setting when you turn it back on. I don't understand impatient reviewers who complain that they have to keep their finger on the on/off control for maybe a whole second. Made sturdily with lots of adjustability of each arm and lamp head. Unfortunately, mine would not extend out horizontally and hold the position; the joint closest to the clamp would not stay rigid so it did a slow droop and I had to prop it with a box. I contacted the company for instructions on how to tighten this joint, followed the easy instructions, but it was already as tight as it was going to be. I have another work area needing adjustable lighting where I can mount it vertically, and it functions perfectly there, allowing me to swivel it into different positions. When I let the company know I'm keeping it for this other use, though they had offered to replace it, they gave me a full refund. Wow. Very conscientious folks who care about what they sell. Wish all sellers were this honest. Don't hesitate to make a purchase.",
