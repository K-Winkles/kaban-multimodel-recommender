                "reviewText": "There is much about this lamp that is exceptional, some features are truly unique, but I find one feature of uncommon utility and that is the wireless remote., which adjusts color balance and brightness as well as on/off. Having a choice of placement of, and thus accessibility to, the controls allows one to readily make use of those adjustments as ambient light conditions change and one\u2019s area of focus with the desktop landscape changes. The more lamps you have, and the larger the active workspace area is in use, the more valuable this ability becomes.For context, much of every day I am at my desk at home sitting in front of two large monitors writing up forensic reports\u2014all too often well into the night. Ambient lighting changes greatly over that time\u2014both due to what light comes from outside and the number of lights on inside. Nearly every inch of my desktop is covered with pages of notes, test sheets, and medical and legal records. My 7 decade old eyes require more light to see clearly across the entire desk and monitors. To achieve that, I have wide lamp heads facing down over each monitor and two side lamps for coverage to each side of the keyboard. I also have one gooseneck spotlight to shine directly down into opened side drawers of the desk. All of these high quality lights are capable of providing variable illumination, but only two make it easy to achieve\u2014those with controls off the light itself. Only those two\u2014one with a wired remote, and this one which is wireless\u2014 allow me to change the settings without distraction or need to shift my attention away from my work. For me, that makes these the most used and valued lights on the desk.",

                "reviewText": "Nice light and I like the articulated arm. Having a remote is really handy, although not the most important feature. The RBG is pretty useless. But it is decently bright and good to have. The biggest concern is the clamp used to secure it to the desk. It's a really small clamp and when you move the lamp it feels like the clamp is going to break. Also it has a motion detector that doesn't seem to be able to be turned off. That is kind of annoying since it can activate when you don't intend.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new desk lamp that didn't take up desk space, was bright and adjustable, and stood tall so it wouldn't glare in my eyes. This lamp fills those priorities perfectly. And it has lots of other bells and whistles that I didn't need but sure come in handy and some that are just plain cool. The motion sensor to turn it on and off is way better than trying to find at button in the dark. The sensor has a small LED light next to it so you just have to wave your hand within a couple inches in front of the LED to turn it on and off. The remote allows you to adjust the brightness and color temperature of the lamp as well as turn it on or off. It also lets you turn on the cool features. On the back of the arm and the top of the lamp are color changing LEDs and you can adjust the color and mode of these LEDs. It also lets you turn these LEDs into music mode where lamp listens to the music your're playing and it makes the lights flash to the music. Again these are cool features but not necessary on a desk lamp, but they sure are fun.",
