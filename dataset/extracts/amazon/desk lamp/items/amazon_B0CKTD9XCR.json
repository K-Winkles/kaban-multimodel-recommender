                "reviewText": "This works very well on my bench top for my jewelry metalsmithing. I am using the base because my bench doesn\u2019t have enough clearance to use the clamp. It is very versatile in terms of movement making working much easier. My only comment is that, despite the base being heavy, if you extend the arm completely on a horizontal axis, it will tilt. I have place a heavy object on the base to prevent this. Obviously, not everyone is going to need to extend the base like I do but my bench is packed with tools so I need to do that.",
