                "reviewText": "I purchased a little Epson laser projector (Ef-12) a couple of years ago and now I can now watch the 150 inch image in my bedroom before going to sleep at the end of the day. One thing that is necessary for decent image quality on this relatively low lumen projector, is good light control. With some high quality curtains, I now have exceptional light control and the image on my bedroom wall is stunning. Sometimes I like to do some work from the little bed/work table I have set up beside me. I needed a portable lamp to add a bit of light without disturbing the image on the big screen. This cordless lamp has been a fantastic solution for this task. I am a stickler for warm color temperature and good dimming control. The lamp provides the right amount of warm light without the blue color that can make it hard to fall asleep near the end of my day. The battery seems to last me days and I use a portable power bank to top it off when it needs a charge. I wish it had a more standard usb-c connector, but the battery life, features and price make this an exceptional buy. Highly recommended.",

We use it at the dining room table late at night. When we have a smoke sesh, it\u2019s very nice to have subtle lighting. We don\u2019t want ceiling lights on over our heads. We wanted a soft light LED battery operated lamp to light up our round table with friends and family. It\u2019s a tall table lamp, the exact size we were looking for.We are so happy with our purchase. The battery has a long life and we will get plenty of use out of it. We highly recommend buying!You won\u2019t regret it!",

I take it for the night stand to read at night. It is very flexible. The only issue I have, though it hasn't happened yet, is where it bends, it will eventually start to bend on its own and no longer be any good.",

I like the goose-neck flexibility and the cordless feature is awesome - I have adequate battery life, but I never tested the duration as I use about 2-3 hrs per charge and never ran out. The Bulb is about 5-inches, which casts adequate light for my workspace, but it would be nice if it had a wider cast and a taller stance (about 15-inch).",
