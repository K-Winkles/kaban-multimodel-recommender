Please be assured to buy. Will the night light be too bright? The first batch of products did have a problem with the night light being too bright, but we have adopted customer feedback and have upgraded the product. The LED light will reduce the brightness, which is more suitable for quiet nights. If there is a problem with the product I received, who do I contact and how do I contact them? Please send messages via Amazon or our after-sales emails and we will deal with it as soon as we receive it.",
