However there are some little details that go unnoticed that should be mentioned.For starters, the bottom is coated with a non-slip and non-scratch felt or suede covering, this is a nice touch. Also the lamp has a weighted base to it be prevent you from accidentally knocking it over. It's a small thing, but it makes a significant difference.Consider also, the lamp shade is of a fairly standard 1.5ish inch diameter. You do have the ability to replace or upgrade the shade portion independently of the lamp if you want to try something that might suit your aesthetic tastes better.And finally, they offer a decent variety of finishes. I cannot recall the number of times I've found a product that I've liked only to wonder \"I wish they made this in a different color.\"I've liked it enough to order 3 (all in separate orders). Time will tell how it holds up, but I have a feeling there will be no problem.",

                "reviewText": "Really nice lamps. Great price, they look good and are remarkably sturdy. 2 prong plug on top and 2 usb plugs on side, really convenient. Pull chain for on and off. They come assembled which is nice. Unwrap the shades, turn them around and, viola, 2 great lamps. Not very tall, I knew this when I bought them. Description is correct, so don\u2019t complain that they are small. I\u2019ve had compliments on them from my guests. Id definitely buy again.",
