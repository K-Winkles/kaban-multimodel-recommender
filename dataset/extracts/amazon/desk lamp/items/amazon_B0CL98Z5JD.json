The clamp is strong and cushioned (nice touch - it won\u2019t scratch whatever it\u2019s attached to). The neck is sturdy and can be bent in any direction. I like that the switch is located on the back of the shade. It ships with a light bulb - a nice bonus. Lastly, the packaging is tiny, minimal and \u201cno frills (this is a good thing).",

                "reviewText": "These lamps are functionally flawed. The wireless charging is extremely weak. I put my phone on at 10% and after six hours was only up to 25%. The button to turn the light on is a simple touch sensor right next to where you put your phone to wirelessly charge, making it extremely easy to accidentally turn the light on when trying to grab your phone in the middle of the night or in the morning when still dark. The light has three dimming options. However, you have to go up through all of them in order to turn the light off. So, if you have it on the dimmest setting and want to turn it off, you have to go through the two brighter options before the light turns off. Also the outlets, both the USB and the standard outlet, have a blue light inside of them, so when nothing is plugged in, and the lights are off, it emits a blue light. Not worth the money, even though they\u2019re cheap. They do look nice, I just wish they were more functionally smart.",
