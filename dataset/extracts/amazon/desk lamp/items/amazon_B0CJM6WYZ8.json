                "reviewText": "This is the perfect lamp for a jewelers bench that has edges that won't fit a c-clamp style work lamp. The base is flat so that you can sit tools on it (meaning it's not in the way because it's a usable surface) and it looks sleek. The brightness and color temperature levels are a great touch. Because the hinge style doesn't require that the main arm bend backward in order to lower down the lights, it can fit against a wall in a corner. I hope it lasts because the design is just what I've been looking for on my bench.",

My only negative to note is that the base should either be heavier or more elongated to support the lamp head if extended forward.
