                "reviewText": "My old \"goose neck\" desk lamp finally gave up the ghost and I needed a simple replacement for it. What I found out in my search for a new one is that many desk lamps sold at lighting shops, and even at home improvement stores are way, way overpriced for what they are. The Banker's Lamp I purchased on Amazon.com was just what I needed.The green shade, as some have pointed out, may be lighter in hue than traditional banker's lamp shades. But because I have never owned one before, the shade of green seemed just fine to me and didn't appear to be light at all. The unit is solidly built, and it only took a few minutes to assemble the unit. I like the way the pull chain works--it feels solid and will be able to take a lot of heavy use. Some have reported that the chain sometimes gets stuck and cannot be pulled down. This problem seems to be intermittent and can easily be fixed by just pushing the chain gently back into the hole to \"reset\" it. Add a drop of oil and the problem is solved.I used a 15 watt CFL bulb in this lamp and it works great. You can rotate the shade to direct the light's intensity away or towards you.Overall, for under $20, at the time of this writing, this is an excellent desk lamp.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this for my husband to use over his piano to read his sheet music. The product is sturdy, and I like the soft light it gives to the rest of the room while it's on, but at the same time, shining a bright light directly down onto the surface it rests on, illuminating your desk for easy reading. If you buy the lamp as a desk lamp, it's intended purpose, it's absolutely perfect; however, there are a few very slight drawbacks if you're using it for a piano light, which is why I purchased this. So the cons are: 1. The farther away you place the lamp from the surface you are focusing on, the less intense the light is, making it less effective for illuminating what's below it. 2. Expanding on my first point, another negative is that the base of this lamp is large. While the large circumference of the base makes it sturdy, it does tend to block some light from going past the base. So if you're not planning to use it as a desk lamp, it may be a problem. 3. Again, it has a large base making it not as \"shelf friendly\" as I'd like. 4. The lamp shade only comes in green.So to elaborate, I have an electronic keyboard which rests against a wall. Above the keyboard I had mounted a shelf, and put an old lamp I had laying around the house on the shelf. This way, I can turn the lamp on while playing so that it would illuminate my sheet music. I decided to buy this banker's lamp to replace my old lamp. The small issues I'm having are that the base of the banker's lamp is large and doesn't really set well on the shelf. It overhangs the shelf, so I will probably have to get a wider shelf. On the other hand, the large base makes for a sturdy lamp; additionally, once the lamp is on the shelf, the intensity of light diminishes, and the base of the lamp also blocks some additional light. It seems as though maybe lowering the placement of my shelf and tilting the green lamp shade out a little bit should increase the intensity of light enough for me to read my sheet music. It is a sturdy, well-made product. I do wish the glass shade came in other colors. I saw some other lamps with different shades, but upon reading the descriptions of those I discovered the shades were made of plastic and the rest of the lamp was made of cheaper materials. I ultimately chose this one because of the quality, and I am glad I did. All in all its a good, quality lamp. After a few adjustments, it should work great for my piano.",
