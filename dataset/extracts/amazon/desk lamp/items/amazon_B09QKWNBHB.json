                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic little desk light for the price! It holds a few pens and pencils, to make things a bit tidier and the three light settings are perfect! The wireless charger works too with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I am guessing the reviewer who said it does not has a case on that prevents it from functioning. I do not use a case on my phone. Either that or it was not positioned correctly. For me, it does have to be off-center. Do I have complaints? Sure! I wish it came in black. I wish it held more pens and pencils. I wish I could change the temperature of the lighting. I wish it had five brightness levels instead of three. I wish I could change the color of the light from white, to red, to blue, to green, and back to white. I wish it telescoped up and down. I wish it did my dishes for me. I\u2019m sure I could think of more. At the price, none of those complaints are valid. All those things would raise tge price, cause it to have a more confusing user interface, and add more that could malfunction. The only thing I will note for some people is that it may be smaller than you expect. Pay attention to those dimensions. It is perfectly sized for what we use it for.",

                "reviewText": "I got this light to replace my Ghost Light I had purchased last week. That one would turn on randomly at odd hours. Casper was practicing a standup routine or something. This light is a game changer though. It's small and compact size is actually nice with the limited table space I have near my bed. I'll be damned if I'm going to move my mason jar tea glass out of reach just for a light. The brightness levels and light settings are easy to control and great illumination. The wireless charger holds my phone easily and the indicator is hard to ignore as it flashed from red to blue in a quite rhythmic and blinding fashion. In fact, once my phone hit 100% last night, it looked like the ATF thought my last name was Koresh. All in all, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone, especially police departments on a budget.",
