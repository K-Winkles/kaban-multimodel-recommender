I like that I can have it in my bedroom when I'm sleeping because it doesn't emit any light when it is off. Also it doesn't make any electrical sounds at all, unlike a different lamp that I bought from a different seller. The flexibility of the neck is a huge plus. I like this lamp so much that after trying it out I bought a second one. One of the major pluses of the design is that in the dark it is super easy to turn on quickly. We got one specifically for a room that has it's main light out of reach. So instead of having to make our toe-stubbing way across the whole room to get to the light switch, we can just put our hand down on the base of the lamp and the touch sensitive on button works every time. It's perfect for the bedside for that reason too. Weird sound in the middle of the night? I can just put my hand out and it is so easy to get it to turn on. No fumbling for the switch or turning it the wrong direction or anything like that. I couldn't be happier with this lamp! Oh! And the charging port on the side has come in so handy!! Seriously this is a great value. Design, function, looks, versatility, everything.",

It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space and the fact you can charge your cell phone or other devices from it makes it even better. I have one in my craft room, one on my nail cart for doing dip nails and one on my work desk. Highly recommend!",

I was a little worried about it glaring in my eyes without a shade around it, but it is perfectly designed to so that the light is recessed a little. Even though it is small, the light is very bright on the third level and the flexible neck allows the light to be placed in just the right spot for a number of chores. Although it is small, it is plenty tall enough (about 13 \" in the normal bent position), and I have had no problems with its tipping. As a matter of fact, it seems very sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a white and a black desk lamp. The white for my bedroom, the black for my computer desk. I was replacing a beloved computer lamp that died. These were inexpensive and looked like what I needed. I wanted the USB port on the side for my room because I could charge my phone and still have the lamp plugged in. I only have two outlets by my bed and one has my alarm clock plugged in.The lamps are good. They are simple. They have three levels of lighting that rotate with a touch and they do have a USB port on the side. The one thing that disappointed me is that the USB port cannot fast charge my phone. It charges it in the slower mode. That isn't a major issue since I charge my phone overnight anyway but I would have preferred a fast charging USB port. Other than that, these lamps are very good. Flexible, bright,and fairly weighted so that the lamp doesn't tip over when I adjust the light. They could stand to use a bit more weight on the base but it's just enough to keep the lamp upright when I mess with it.I feel the illumination is great and it works both for my compute desk needs and my bedroom. Very, very simple to set up with just a plug to attach. I haven't had these long so I can't speak to their longevity yet. I will update if they don't last long. These lamps are not the very best you can buy. They don't have blue light filtering or warm and cool light, just plain ole white light. But for me, they are fine and the price is right!",
