I like having a light that is out of the way and only lights up my 63inch desk. The rgb lighting looks great while i am gaming or doing music prodution. I can have both the regular light and rgb on at the same time or just the rgb or regular light. Only flaw i have is that when the light is off, the button for the rgb is not lit up. There is also a 1hr timer button that i press when i turn it on that will turn the light off if i walk away and forget too. If you need a light for u desk i recommend you get this one even if you dont need the rgb lights.",

                "reviewText": "This worked well, but I felt like the instructions could be a little clearer. It came with a set of 3 types of screws. One of those types, as far as I can tell, don't get used for anything. The instructions for assembly sort of specified which screw to use where, but it was more guessing what made the most sense, I think a little picture of the correct screw for each step would help (plus not having an extra screw that isn't used). There are extras if needed. Once assembled though everything works as expected. It wasn't immediately clear to me that one half of the two pieces you stick together is not actually metal (I initially thought I was missing a piece). But then I realized it is sorta rubber and bends to shape, so once you install it you can bend it down however you need it. You'll want it bent so that the lower LEDs are out of your line of sight as they are very bright, even at the lowest setting. I like that I can change the type of white light from cool to warm. I keep it at a warm temp. The RGB part is neat, but I do wish there was a mode that was solid, I would guess you'd need one extra button to cycle the colors. It has a breathing mode that slowly cycles through the colors, a dancing mode where it just has the colors rotating rapidly along the bar, and a noise mode where it lights up and flashes with noise (nice for games or music, or if you are bored in a online meeting and need some entertainment). Overall, I can't complain, the main thing I wanted was a light that could go high enough to be over my monitors and light up my work area, particularly when I'm trying to fix electronics or something.",

                "reviewText": "This LED desk lamp is very impressive. The lamp's brightness is just what I needed. It's 24W of ultra-bright light that turns night into day on my desk. Whether I'm grinding through work reports or chilling with some late-night gaming, this lamp has got me covered. The light is soft yet bright, and it doesn't flicker, which is a huge plus when you're staring at a screen for hours on end.",
