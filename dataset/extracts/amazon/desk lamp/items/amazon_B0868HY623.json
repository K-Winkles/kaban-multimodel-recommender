I'm not worried about a power source for charging my phone.I have no complaints, the lamp is easy to use and the folding arm comes in handy when I need to have the light source a little further on my keyboard tray. Inexpensive and gives off good light. I tend to use the white light not the yellow light. I work on models and the white light is good.",

All parts of it are out of the way. The on-off apparatus is touch-and-glide and very easy to use. The light range is really good, ranging from a dim low to what I'd think is nearly daylight bright (and I'm in Florida). I only wish the light was a bit warmer. I find that cold light makes working with colors tricky. Fortunately, there's a window nearby.",

I use it for very gentle warm lighting on migraine days and to color-correct the glare from outside when it's foggy, and it works well for both purposes.The bad: the USB-C port is glitchy as all hell. It started flickering if the cord wasn't *precisely* in the right position a couple months ago, and by now it flickers nearly all the time whether or not anything is even touching the cord. I'm careful to keep cords from tugging on ports as a general rule, but this will start flickering when it's been on for two hours with literally nothing else moving on the desk, or when it's turned on after having been off for two minutes, even if I tape the cord down so it can't move.Maybe mine is just glitchy, but I'm reluctant to buy a second one when the first started having trouble after 3-4 months of very careful use.",
