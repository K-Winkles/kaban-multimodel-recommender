                "reviewText": "I was thrilled to find this lamp- the majority of lamps with a wireless charging pad have irreplaceable bulbs and just don't look like a regular lamp (I wanted a wireless charging lamp I could put an RGB Smart Bulb in). This lamp works perfectly and the adjustment features are pretty great when needed. The only con I can even come up with is the base of the lamp, the wireless charging pad (which can be pretty annoying). I'm not sure why the wireless charging base of this lamp is so tall (it's literally just a wireless charging pad) and not very wide, but I would argue that it deducts some points from aesthetics. Not to mention, the charging pad doesn't even take up the full area of the base (it's too small IMO). I find myself spending too much time trying to place my phone absolutely perfect enough for it to charge. If you're taking aesthetics into account more than functionality (like I did), then I think this lamp will be just fine (especially since there aren't many like it out there).",

It's really quiet but it's still there and if I had to guess it's probably the wireless charger.",
