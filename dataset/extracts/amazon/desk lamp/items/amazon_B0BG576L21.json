                "reviewText": "Our daughter uses this desk lamp and really likes the extra \"holder\" on it. In the picture is shows a phone, but our daughter is too young for a phone. She actually uses this space to store the book that she's currently reading. I love that this lamp came with an AC adapter so it plugs into the outlet. A lot of lamps I looked at were USB chargeable, and that wouldn't work for us. This is a great lamp, easy to wipe down for cleaning and has survived the torture of a 7 year old for about 6 months!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bright bedside gooseneck lamp with extras!",
                "reviewText": "This is a really great lamp. It has slots to fit your tablet and phone devices, including a USB 1 amp charger port on the rear top left of the base, and a 2-prong regular electrical plug on the other righthand side. Again, very useful to plug in another charger, laptop computer etc.The light projected is flicker free LED and 800 lumens - equivalent to a 75 watt bulb. The gooseneck allows you to focus the light down or where needed, and with the flared hood around the LED, this lamp can be easily adjusted so that its is not blinding. It\u2019s pretty bright!The base also has 2 square compartments, ideal to store pens, pencils and such. Yet, the lamp base is a small size taking up minimum real estate on the side table.OBSERVATIONS ON THIS AMAZON LISTING BY THE MANUFACTURER:I don\u2019t usually do this, but since this is a great and useful lamp for the price, I would like to note that the TITLE of the listing seems to be a model number (AL53640bK) and not a description.\u2014- I would list this as: \u201cOrganizer LED Desk Lamp with USB and Electrical sockets - Gooseneck, 800 lumens using only 4 watts\u201d.\u2014- The item description lower down the page lists the lamp as \u201cbattery\u201d. It is actually an electrical plug-in lamp.\u2014- The dimensions are listed twice.\u2014- The WATTS is listed as 5 watts/hour. This does not make sense.The photos on the listing is accurate and descriptive!It\u2019s a cute minimalist design. I gave it to my daughter who is in Med School (still lives with us) and she uses it almost exclusively when studying on her reclining bed. She was looking for something just like this. Bravo.We highly recommend this lamp. It\u2019s a great purchase that I expect will last quite a while!",

                "reviewText": "I got this light for my daughter's room to give her a place for her phone to charge and a lamp to read by. She loved it. It has one USB charging port and is perfect for a phone or small tablet. the bulb is incorporated in and appears to be LED so the hood stays rather cool to the tough vs a conventional bulb. The light is bright enough to use as a reading lamp or she sometimes moves it to her desk to use while drawing or crafting.",
