So I bought one to compare with my initial purchase. It was hands down. I returned the other one, bought five more of this. Two to replace my bedside lamps and three as gifts to friends and family. They love it.I read in one of the reviews that the thermometer is only in Celsius. I am not sure if the manufacturer has made an improvement but with a press of the button at the back, you can change that to Fahrenheit. Please check the manual to correctly set date,time and the alarm. This product is great. Thank you.",

I can monkey around with the whole lamp but it\u2019s awkward and ends up out of place on my desk. Being able to rotate the light bar would give it 5 stars in my book. With its wart, I\u2019m glad I bought it.",

Also seems to flicker a lot even though it's plugged into the same clean electrical source as my computer and other equipment.",
