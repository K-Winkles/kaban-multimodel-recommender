                "reviewText": "I initially bought this lamp so I can light up my small desk for studying. And that's what I did, and it served that purpose well. But it was not until I used this lamp for a quick watch repair that I realized the true utility and potential for this lamp!I recently bought a watch from Amazon, but unfortunately it arrived with a dead battery. After buying a replacement battery, I set about removing the watch's back and loosening the tiny screw that held the dead battery in place. Using the adjustable swinging arms, I was able to position the lamp just under my chin for the perfect angle, so that my hands were not blocking the light. The different light modes and dimness adjustments were also extremely handy in adjusting the brightness, so that I did not blind myself with the watch's metal finish. Needless to say, I was extremely happy with my buy, and I really began to appreciate the multiple adjustments this lamp offers. Now obviously there are specialty lights with a magnifying glass built in for small fine work such as watch repairs, painting tiny figurines, etc, but for the average person, this lamp is exceptional. I can imagine attaching this to a work bench as well. Because of this experience, I decided to leave this product review. Truly, this is a versatile lamp, that provides great lighting, is built well, and is offered for a very competitive price.Below are a few more details about the light:As a previous buyer pointed out, the usb plug-in gets quite hot when the lamp is on and in use. The lamp itself also gets warm, but not so hot that you cannot keep your fingers or hand on it. The part that gets warm is the metal part, the actual plastic covering is less hot. Still, as I mentioned, you can still grab the lamp and turn it and move it whatever which way you need it, even after a couple hours of the light being on. The joints move well and smoothly, and the lamp does not move after you set it (note that I've only had this lamp a week by the time of this product review).The lamp appears to have 2x bulbs inside it. One provides \"warm\" light, and the other provides a \"cool\" light. The 3rd mode turns both of these bulbs on, and seems to be the brightest. 10x levels of adjustable brightness.One thing I do like is that on the controls, the \"power\" button is lit up when the lamp is off, so you can easily find which button to press in the dark. When you turn it on, the power button light goes off.The vice clamp is sturdy. It hasn't moved at all with me adjusting the arm and twisting and turning the light. It clamps onto something as thin as a piece of paper, and opens up to a maximum of about 6cm, or about 2.3 inches (Take this part with a grain of salt, as what I provided was an estimation. I just moved and I cannot find my ruler).Overall, I am very happy with this light, and obviously more so after I was able to use it more than just for reading and writing. For a ~$20 light, it is well worth the money.",

Your mileage may vary with the clamp- the edges of my desk are too ornate for a C-clamp to work but I had an unused grommet and it finished super clean. Super satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my office workspace, and it clamps nicely to the desktop of my standup desk. I like the controls, the range of light colors, and the selection of brightness. My only complaint is that the head doesn't rotate. This means that when I lower the desktop and the head of the light is above my head level, I can't rotate it away so it isn't shining in my face.",

                "reviewText": "Rated 14W according to the instructions - that should have been in the *listing* first* so I could have avoided this choice (or in lumens output to make judging what to expect possible). DIM !! 10 brightness levels: so what? They start out way too low for a max. Worse, the control is mounted on the wire *FAR* too close to the lamp, making it pretty much impossible in my use to set this up usefully, awkward everywhere. Still worse, that control is always lit up even when the lamp is turned off - not good in a bedroom!Trying to decide if the fuss of returning it is worthwhile as I try it this way and that but no matter what I try, that darn control just can't go anywhere that works usefully!Follow up: 10 months later:The tiny \"wall wart\" type power adapter died. Probably needed to be a bit more powerful than the 2A rating of what came with it. Any even roughly similar sized adapter that has a USB A output like this is set up with now comes with a \"charging control\" chip included that registers the (above, annoying) always lit up control a a \"charged up battery\" and will not light the lamp unless you unplug it first so the unit puts out full current again. Any power supply meant for a lamp (without a charging control chip of this sort) is both larger, costlier, and does not come with a USB A output connection, instead being supplied with the typical \"barrel plug\" that most such lights use and you're stuck unless you are capable of some electronic work of waste a LOT more time trying to find adapters for this, after wasting a lot of time trying to find a charge control-less adapter first so be warned. Had to downgrade the rating to a dim one star after this wasted my money and later a lot of time.",
