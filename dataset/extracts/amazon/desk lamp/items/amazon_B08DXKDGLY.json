I am very impressed with the modern sleek design, it can adjust several ways and takes up minimal space, a usb charger is on the base. The 5 bright levels and color modes are very convenient- from different levels of cool white to warm. Additionally, the lamp swivels in several positions and there are two different timers that you have an option to select: 30 minutes or 60. I use the 60 minutes at bedtime on the low setting for my child. For the price, multi functions overall aesthetics I am very satisfied with this lamp. I highly recommend this beautiful lamp.",

So now I have to told the charger at the base or simply I can\u2019t use it. It\u2019s a putty because it\u2019s still a 25 dollar lamp that I wish would of held up better",
