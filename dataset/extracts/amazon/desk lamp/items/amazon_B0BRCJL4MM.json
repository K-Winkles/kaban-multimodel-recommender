                "reviewText": "This desk lamp has been a game changer for improving eye strain at my work station. I purchased it specifically to provide better lighting over my dual monitor setup, with the goal of reducing eye fatigue after long hours staring at screens. I'm happy to report after just a couple days of use, I've already noticed a positive difference.The fully adjustable gooseneck design makes it easy to position the light bar exactly where I need it, evenly extending over both my monitors. The dimmable LEDs provide just the right brightness without causing any screen glare. I love the ability to customize the color temperature from cool daylight to warm yellow light as needed throughout the day.The wireless remote is very convenient for adjusting settings without having to reach up and fiddle with buttons on the lamp. The different modes help dial in varying degrees of brightness and warmth. It's nice to have presets, but so simple to manually set your own preference too.Overall, this lamp feels very well-made and sturdy. The desk clamp and adjustable joints maintain position without drooping over time. For the price, I'm impressed with the performance, sturdiness and customizability. If you're looking to improve your home office or workspace lighting with focus on reducing eye strain, this lamp delivers. I'm seeing benefits already and would definitely recommend.",

The remote for the controls is nice because it isn\u2019t on top where it can move the lights or near where it clamps which may be hard to reach. The remote can be located conveniently for me. And I like the 2 presets - nightlight and reading. Click on the one most like what I am looking for at the moment and then fine tune from there. This is a great lamp",

                "reviewText": "This light is exactly what I was looking for! The amount of light that it produces is perfect, the strength of the light is perfect and it is constructed to be very aesthetically pleasing. There are cheaper lights out there, but I didn\u2019t like how the cord had to be wrapped around the gooseneck, where this light plugs in near the base so the cord is very easy to hide. I also like that the gooseneck has a sturdy, rubber or silicone sleeve that has a matte finish and that completely covers it, which makes it much more aesthetic. It is very well constructed. The gooseneck is easy to articulate and bend and flex the light into the position that you want it in without being stiff or too loose. Also, the actual lightbulbs can be swiveled to point in any direction that you want. I currently have mine facing up at my white ceiling , which splashes the illumination across my entire office without being hard on my eyes. This light literally arrived 15 minutes ago and as soon as I plugged it in I ordered two more. It is perfect in every way! And as a bonus, I love how you can control the temperature and brightness of the light via the puck sized controller. if you work on your computer a lot for your job, for a hobby, if you\u2019re a graphics designer, into photography, this light is perfect! I can\u2019t think of anything that this light would not be perfect for. It would also be great for people who sew or do any kind of detail work where you want to be able to control the light source.",
