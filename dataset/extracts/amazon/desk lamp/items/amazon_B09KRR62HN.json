                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoy getting as much for my money as I can, and this desk lamp fits the bill.Pros:-Price-Looks-Color temp can be changed-Brightness can be adjusted-Arm can move and bend however you need it-Can set it to cut off in 30 or 60 minutes-Brightness and color is saved when turning it off-Wireless charging pad can be flat or upright-Extra usb cable at the backCons:-Wireless pad is a little fussy. I have to hold my phone like a centimeter up on the pad to get it to charge but once it starts I can let it slide down on the pad and it continues to charge.-buttons are capacitive and super sensitive. I sometimes manipulate them by accident when grabbing or setting down my phone.I work from home and was looking to get a desk lamp. At the time, I had a headset stand with charging pad on my desk from five-below. It had a gaudy multicolor light that was always on and provided no other function outside of charging my phone and keeping my headset off the desk.This lamp was cheap, handsome, and would allow me to see my phone screen while charging since the pad could be set upright. Another thing I was looking for was a flat arm so I could use one of my 3M style hat hangers to hang my headset, adding to the versatility. Because this lamp also has an extra USB outlet, I can also charge my headset from there.I also like that I can use a softer light at a lower brightness earlier in the morning. My office is in my master bedroom and I usually start my day before my wife is awake. This allows me to have my desk gently illuminated without a jarring light waking her up.The downside to my little headset hook modification is that I can no longer fold the light up\u2026 but I don\u2019t see a scenario where I\u2019d need to anyway.",

                "reviewText": "This looks and feels like a really well manufactured product. It has a nice form factor, and the product functions quite well. I really wanted to love it without any reservation. But ultimately I couldn't love it unconditionally.One thing bugged me -- the indicator light of the wireless charger on the base. BTW, the wireless charger itself is terrific and works great. You simply lay your device on the charging pad. And the product design even gives you an option to tip up the charging pad so that your device stands up. All really good so far.But my problem is this... When you plug in the lamp, that indicator light burns red -- and remains illuminated. When you place your device on the charging pad, that light turns blue. And when you remove the device, the light reverts to red. That is, when you are not charging a device (most of the time), the light on the lamp base burns red constantly.Logically, the indicator light should be lit some color only when a device is being charged. It shouldn't stay lit when there's no device being charged.Aside from the user having to get used to the indicator light being lit one color or another 24/7, I'm concerned that the charging pad circuit/indicator light being energized 24/7 might cause that unique circuit to reach the end of its functional life expectancy well before the lamp's primary lighting functionality went bad. Frankly, I'm confident the lighting circuit will last a very long time. But since the charging pad is a significant feature asset, losing that functionality would reduce the overall useful value of the product. (For all I know, the circuitry design is such that it being energized 24/7 actually is NOT an issue. Yet it remains a reasonable concern for a lay consumer.)Note: If you're planning to use this as a desk lamp (that is, in a room that's not pitch black), you might not find the red light objectionable.. But my product was intended for use as a bedside reading lamp. (BTW the lighting functionality is excellent.) Ultimately, trying to put up with that bright indicator lamp glowing red in a darkened bedroom proved just too annoying to ignore. I didn't want a 'red nightlight' on my bedside table. So, regretfully, I returned the product.Having said all of this, the seller deserves a shoutout of sincere praise. Long before I elected to return the product, I reached out to the seller just to see if perhaps my product was defective. I got a very prompt and helpful response. So, if you are considering purchase of any of the seller's products, I'm confident that you'll be very pleased with the level of support you'll receive. And, if your intent is to use this particular product as a desk lamp, the indicator light probably won't be a deal breaker for you.So, take my caveat with a grain of salt. Had there been no constantly lit red indicator light, I surely would have rated this product an enthusiastic 5 stars.",

This has been great to have some light right at my desk.You can plug this into a wall or into a USB C adapter which I love. It sits nicely in the corner. You can put the arm up or down when not in use. The light can be dimmed or made brighter. There is also a timer on the unit to shut off the light after 30 min or an hour.The charger stand goes up or down. It charges my Iphone 14 even with the case. It is a slower charge, but is great for when I just need a little charge and a stand on my desk.Here is hoping this holds up because as of now, I love it.",
