        "description": "Out of the office and into your home, the Architect Swing-Arm Clamp-On Desk Lamp in glossy white stylishly adds a pop of color to your loft, dorm room, make-up station, night table, chic home office or child's desk. The moveable clamp lets you place your light on any surface with an edge, essentially a truly multipurpose lamp. Swing-arm task lamps can look right at home any where bright, focused light is needed. They can be clamped onto a countertop, a shelf on the wall or onto floating shelves in your kitchen if space is really tight. The durable metal body echoes the stylings of the traditional architect desk lamp design from the 1920s, but the modern color is perfect for the interior designs of today. The adjustable head and neck can be moved without interfering with the wiring, so you always have the perfect light. Try using this lamp with a Globe Electric Smart Bulb to create the ideal lighting solution for any situation.",

                "reviewText": "The clamp I received with my lamp, unlike what some other reviews have said, was metal -- solid cast aluminum. I have no concerns about it failing.In addition, the lamp articulates well, feels fairly sturdy (while still being light enough), and the switch is a typical rotating post lamp switch with a satisfying click.My main complaint is that the lamp just drops into the clamp and stays there due to gravity. The bottom joint of the lamp has a rolled sheet metal post that fits--with basically no wobble--into the hole in the clamp. This would be fine, if it wasn't for the fact that this is an articulating lamp: I accidentally lift it out of the clamp when pushing the lamp head up and away from my work area.I REALLY don't like having to carefully move the lamp slowly and in a roundabout path just to \"retract\" it without it falling out of the clamp and wrecking its surroundings. After a week of this silly babying, I modified it like so:1. I bolted a piece of dowel to the bottom of the lamp arm joint (I actually expanded the existing sheet metal post and fit the dowel inside it.)2. In the clamp, I drilled and tapped an M5 hole that pierces the hole the lamp post sits in.3. On the dowel, I filed away a slot all the way around at the height of the newly drilled hole that is wide enough for an M5 screw4. I inserted the modified lamp's new dowel post into the clamp5. I screwed an M5 screw just far enough into the new hole that it captures the dowel.presto! The lamp still spins all the way around, but it only lifts up out of the clamp about a millimeter. Now I can shove the lamp all around without worrying about it falling out of the clamp.I doubt it would be hard for Globe Electric to add this type of screw-in-slot capture mechanism to the base product. Had I not be able to (relatively) quickly fix this issue, I'd give this lamp 3, MAYBE 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Read all the negative comments and all seemed pretty petty at this price point. The reflector does align with two pin and groove points that could ,over time, wear loose. Initially the reflector seems rather secure however I will be installing a few rivets to insure it stays secure as vibrations from other equipment could cause it to shake loose. As for the mounting clamp, it is more than sufficient for the weight and range of motion of the light fixture. I feel it would be rather easy to overtighten and break the clamp but only if you intentionally do so. The weakest link would definitely be the contact point between the fixture and the clamp. To allow for a complete swing this lamp is designed with a simple gravity based, shaft/socket connection. It would have been nice if the bottom of the socket were drilled through allowing for a screw to provide a \"lock\" point into the bottom of the lamp shaft. Being as the shaft is hollow this is not an easy correction, after the fact. Overall, for my purposes this is exactly what was needed. I can see the noted issues causing a concern if this would have been a more expensive fixture but for the $20 price range what do you expect?",

I think its worth the price I paid for the boom and clamp alone, but then comes with an LED bulb to boot (I remember paying $20 a pop when these first came out). Pretty stable, flexible, good reach for the price. Switch only works one way, but wasn't expecting a lot for this. easy to assemble. Good light to examine small parts take photos etc and push out of the way when you don't need it. People complained about the clamp but though the surface is a bit bigger than I was expecting I think this is adequate for something less than 20$. If you are using it to hold anything but the lamp itself I could see it being a problem, but for its intended purpose its perfectly adequate. booms are about 16\"x16\", max work range about 34\". functional work range about 26\"",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these on the basis of other Amazon reviews. What I received was a product poorly conceived and with sub standard materials1. The \u201c adjustable\u201d arm fits into the table clamp \u201cbase\u201d so loosely that when adjusting it upwards, the entire arm comes loose from the base . I measured the diameters of the clamp tube receptacle ( 13mm ) , and the arm insert which is approx 11 mm. There should be a plastic or nylon bushing if they intended to leave this much of a gap.2. The parts come loose in the box, Ie in the first box, the springs were loose and not installed. This one came with a fluorescent lamp , obviously an Amazon return which Amazon couldn\u2019t bother to check for correct parts. The lamp hood has a type of flimsy bayonet attachment that it is attached to the bulb base. This of course also cannot be tightened more than a little bit because it slips right by the locking tabs and falls off.3. There are two thumbwheel locks on the joints. These do not tighten properly so the lamp will not stay put in any upper position. Upon tightening them they both stripped out. The 8/32 screws are so soft they might as well have used plastic screws .4. The premise of having four springs is that they are supposed to counterbalance the lamp head throughout the full range of travel. However they are sized for extremely lightweight bulbs. If you replace the 9w led bulbs with anything else the head will not stay in place .If these were $5 lamps I would say take a chance and be prepared to make mods to these to get them to work properly. For $25 each they are a complete and utter waste of money.",

No sagging or spring back.Overall, satisfied with both purchases. A bit expensive, but built well enough to be worth it.
