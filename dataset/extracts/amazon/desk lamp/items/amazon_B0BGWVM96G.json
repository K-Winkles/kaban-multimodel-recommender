I really needed some extra light at my sewing machine, but can\u2019t use anything big to take up space especially when working on a bulky gown. The light is adjustable & the lighting is too, so it\u2019s easy on your eyes. I\u2019ve found out the hard way to read reviews. I don\u2019t worry about an occasional negative review because sometimes the buyer has clearly not bought the correct product or used the item correctly. But I can\u2019t imagine this light w/ a negative anything!!! Definitely recommend!!! And I almost forgot you can charge you phone on it!!!!!",

I should have returned this initially because the micro USB slot in the back is loose but as long as th cord doesn't move a lot it works. Now on the other end the USB cord is shot and came apart. This has sat on a table the whole time, so I'm not sure how a cord can wear this much. Charging is mediocre at best.",
