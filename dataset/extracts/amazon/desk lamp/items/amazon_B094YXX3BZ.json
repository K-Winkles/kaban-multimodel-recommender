Since this piano doesn't have any space behind the music sheet stand, we needed light source that has a heavy base and a long arm so the light can shine over the center of a music book. (And, bonus, if we want extra room light we rotate this light fixture upward to bounce off the wall and ceiling, so it can double as a floor lamp.) The feature that it remembers the brightness setting from when it was turned off is also great--no need having to reset the preferred brightness each time it's turned on.",

Many are too lightweight to stand sturdily, or made in such a way that the pole and extensions loosen and sag over time. I haven't had this for long, but I am confident by its design, components, and assembly that it will hold up. The adjustable position of the extension apparatus and overall light is ideal. The base never has to move to reposition the light. As a bonus, the intensity of the light's brightness is adjustable. Easy on; easy off. All this, and it's attractive and a great price. I bought this for my home office. I'm requisitioning the purchase of 6 more for our business office. And, I'll buy my son one for his apartment. Keeper.",

I'm using it for a reading lamp on an end table in the living room. It can be dim, or extremely bright. It is a 'warm' light color ...not that 'greyish' light color like some LEDs. I like that it has a slim profile, so it looks really nice, and not big and clutzy. Very pleased with this lamp !",
