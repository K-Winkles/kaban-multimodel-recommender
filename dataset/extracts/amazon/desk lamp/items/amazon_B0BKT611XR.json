After I got the first lamp, I noticed my husband unplugging it and moving it around our home as he needed it. So I got a second one. But two lamps weren\u2019t enough; he was moving that around too! So I got two more! I\u2019m laughing as I write that, but these lamps are just wonderful and well worth the money. They are fairly easy to set up, easy to use, and have great features. My four lamps are set up in four different locations, giving out great light, and working well for my household!",

I am using this lamp to light up the work area next to my laptop computer, to see my (1) auxiliary keyboard, (2) my mouse and (3) the papers that I take notes from. The position of the lamp pole and head adjusts well and holds where they are set. It provides plenty of light, and I use the intensity from 50% to 100% of full lighting. I typically don't adjust the position or change the light color setting and just turn it on and off when used about 10 hours a day. The color is comfortable on my eyes in all 3 settings. So far it's a win for me and I don't see any reason now why that would change.",

                "reviewText": "The rigid piece rising up from the rectangular base is a little under 1 foot high. The gooseneck portion that goes into it is about 9 more inches, ending with a larger than normal 8 inch high by 3 inch wide light panel. The base is reasonably sturdy. The best thing about the product is the controls on the base - the 5 color modes dont do much for me - for one thing some seem a bit brighter than others rather than just different, and there seems to be more choices on the cool side of the color spectrum than the warm side. I actually liked my prior 3 mode lamp better in this regard. What is very nice on this lamp is the 10 brightness settings implemented via a slider - not so easy to hit all 10, but much easier to operate, especially when you dont have the easiest access or visibility. Power button also quite easy, and it remembers the settings. Havent decided on how much I like the larger light yet, but was pleased to find a gooseneck with a base (many offer only clamps) and good brightness. This one doesnt offer charging ports for phones as some do, which wasnt important to me. Also should mention that the large light itself can be positioned in any fashion - turned up, down, away, angled, etc.",
