Has three color modes and 5 brightness settings, a charging port and a 10 W wireless charging station. If that isn't enough, it also has a display (which can be turned off if desired) that shows time, date, day of week and indoor temperature. Also has a pull out on the front of the base to use as a phone holder. Very handy. The lamp is well constructed, has a leather feel and folds almost flat. May have to get another for the kid's room. Highly recommend.",

I like how you can control the brightness of the lamp and you also have the option to select different light shades. If you double tap the power button it controls the led screen to be bright blue colored or shaded gray. Only downside to this product is how slow it charges iPhone with the touch charging pad. I would not rely on it to charge my phone to reach 100%, if anything it works great for sitting on the couch for a few minutes before leaving to run an errand.",
