                "reviewText": "I just purchased and received this light about 1 week ago. Attached it to my large puzzle table (approximately 4'x3') and it helps so much. It seems nice and sturdy and love the total arm length as the stiff upright part together with the flexible part allow me to have the light up out of my way and well over the board without getting in my way. Also love that it's very unobtrusive and neat and that it clamps easily onto my table (which is 3/4\" plywood) without having to be taking up a lot of table top space that so many lamp/light bases take up. (Plus, as I made my table by attaching it to a drafting table type of frame so that I can have slant the table when I wish, table top lamps/lights tend to slide/fall off the table when it is slanted... not good.) The flexible part of this light's arm is the best I've had on anything and so easy to adjust just how I want it at any given time. I love that the light bar is attached to the flex arm on a ball joint, thereby making it so easy to move it around to get the light focused just where I need it in order to avoid any glare off the puzzle pieces. Plus, being able to adjust the light color itself is also great for as the light changes in the room from bright sunny days, to overcast days and long nights. (Yes, I get hooked on my puzzles and spend many a time working on them well into the wee morning hours.) Note that it just comes with the usb cord but no AC Adapter, but as I, like many of us, have several USB plug adapters left over from old phones, tablets, Kindle's, etc., it really was not a problem at all for me. Just wanted to note that to make you aware of it. Again, highly recommend this light!Now to give it the test of time to see how well it lasts, but I'm not too concerned there as it does appear to be a good solid light and fits the purpose I was wanting it for perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "It has good light output, and I like how I can control the color temperature from white to orange/evening. My only criticism is, it can only be turned on by supplying power to it, then walking up to it, finding the button on the cord, and pressing the power button. It is unable to be controlled remotely with a smart plug, because if this lamp loses power, when it regains power it will always be in the \"off\" state. So, I can only use this lamp when the lights are already on in the room so I can find the switch for this lamp, and I'm already sitting at the desk, only using this lamp to amplify the lighting in the room already present. Also, it's bendy. Nice!",

I was able to clamp it to a 3 inch piece of wood that I have on my desk which made it convenient for me since I did not want to clamp it onto the plexiglass. It gave me enough height that I did not have to worry about it truly being in the way. It also ended up being a great light for my camera. The clamps for the light itself are a little flimsy but once you get them in place they stay nicely. It does not come with a plug for the light itself however I plugged it into my hard drive this way I did not have to worry about any additional plugs. Great product!",

It clamps down easily, good light, multiple light output settings, easily adjustable, and the switch works good. My only complaint is that the switch is located in the cord and it is halfway between the lamp and the plug. That means to change settings or to turn it on or off I have to get up and walk around the table to reach the switch. Not a big deal, I know, but it would be nice if the switch was located right at the lamp instead of 3 or 4 feet away.",
