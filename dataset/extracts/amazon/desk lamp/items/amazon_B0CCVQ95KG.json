                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My thoughts on \"Bright Led Desk Lamp for College Dorm\":There are a few things that I like about this lamp and some that I really do not like.I DO LIKEIt has a nice, sleek design and can be folded easily. The instructions and the information on the box do not show that the upper beam can be moved vertically (180 degrees) and they do not mention that the upper part can be moved horizontally. I have discovered that the beam can change its position also horizontally, which made me very happy.The base could have been heavier to my liking but it should do its job, as it is. It has a good padding. The base is made of plastic; the arms are made of some kind of metal.The USB cord would be probably too short (~48 inches) if the grid outlet is located close to the floor.The light is bright and there is a decent selection of color temperatures. It has also a 45 minute timer to turn off the light, that might be useful (e.g., falling into sleep and having light on for some time).I DO NOT LIKEThere are two things that I do not like about this lamp. The USB charger port is useless. When I plug in my phone, the estimated charging time is about 6-8h(!). I tried a few USB cables but it did not matter. It is why I took one star off the rating.The second thing I did not like was that I could not find how to dim the light. The instructions, the information on the box and the description of the product on the website claim that the lamp is \"infinitely dimmable\" but there is no info how to dim the light. There is no special button, neither the slider on the lamp. I read some reviews and reviewers mentioned that the power button needs to be held which, indeed works and results in dimming the light.SUMMARYIn summary, I like the lamp, its sleek design, and brightness. The 45-minute timer is a convenient option. The instructions do not mention that to dim the light you need to press and hold the power button. They do not mention that the upper part can be moved in both directions: vertical and horizontal. The USB charging port is useless for me (6-8h estimated charging time for the phone).Thanks!",

It is very good for me as I always use the computer for a long time, and handle paperwork or read on the desk as well. So I need a good desk lamp. This LED desktop can meet my requirements. My eyes don't become tired easily. The folding design makes it a space saver, it can be folded up when it is not in use. The lamp is powered by the connection of the USB-C cable and at the same time it can charge other electronic devices through the built-in USB port. It has touch buttons on the base of the lamp to control the lamp so it is kind of trendy. The lamp looks sturdy and durable too. For the price of less than $20, I would say it exceeds my expectations. I would recommend this lamp to my friends.",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, the lamp I received has a slightly bent top. It's not terrible, but it is very noticeable. I don't care that much because I'm in a temporary space and I didn't get this for aesthetics, but quality control seems to be lacking and it looks like these lamps are hit or miss. Out of the box, mine works ok. There's no high pitch noise and the top of the lamp is easily adjustable without collapsing. I have it at the angle I want so I probably won't touch it again. I'll just try to move it around from the base.I like that there are three different light settings ranging from warm to normal to cool, and a timer for 45 minutes of use. All of the settings are accessible by a quick and light touch so no reaching for a switch on a cord to power this on and off. The lamp has a sleek minimalist design and doesn't take up too much space on my desk so that's a plus. Keep in mind the cord is pretty short so you'll have to put it near an outlet or have an extension cord on hand.",

First, I do use mine at my home desk when there. I find it very bright, yet it can be dimmed to just the right level and the color temperature of the light can be changed. But, since it is only about 16 inches in length when folded it will fit in most suitcases and even carry-ons. And it is powered by a USB power adapter plug-in so it will work anywhere in the world with the propter adapter. And, when working late at night on reports for the next day's meetings having a real desk lamp rather than a hotel light makes like so much easier.",
