I installed a \"100 watt\" equivalent LED bulb for task lighting and works well on the lamp. The switch is 1 foot down the cord which makes it inconvenient to turn off/on (in my opinion). Would be better on the light somewhere. As a base to place the lamp on a desk or similar and a clamp fixture for a bench or table. Neither is particularly robust but adequate. The clamp base aldo allows the lamp to be screwed permanent to a surface. Overall, I'm satisfied and the price is cheap.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a decent enough lamp, especially for the price. But had I known about the base and clamp issues, I probably would have looked elsewhere. The base it too light; you can\u2019t extend the arm too far out or the center of gravity shifts and it tips over. It will stay in the classic \u201clamp pose\u201d just fine, but I bought this to put by my bed. I want it to be able to extend over/retract so that I can shine it down onto my bed as I do homework in my dormroom. And it can do that, but it has a far more limited range than it\u2019s arm length would suggest due to it\u2019s inability to not fall over when stretched that far. The clamp it comes with is also a bit of a joke. Can it work under ideal circumstances? Sure. But it\u2019s fairly cheap feeling plastic (rest of the lamp body is metal), has a relatively tiny clamp diameter, doesn\u2019t \u201clock\u201d the lamp end into itself (it\u2019s a friction fit for the clamp, the base has a thumbscrew you can tighten once you insert the lamp\u2019s bottom so that it stays relatively secure), and does not have the strength/sturdiness to hold the lamp at anything but an upright configuration. You can\u2019t clamp it sideways; it really can\u2019t do anything that the base can\u2019t do, except for save a tiny bit of space at the edge of your desk. I\u2019m honestly not going to bother returning it, I will be using it for the foreseeable future because it does work fine. But if I happen to see a better one at a store or something, it\u2019s probably going to get replaced. The build quality isn\u2019t really there for how I wanted to use it, but it\u2019s also not a knockoff or anything. It works, looks fine, and can get fairly bright depending on what bulb you put into it. I\u2019m just disappointed by the balance issues, as well as the ineptitude of the clamp. Adding several ounces worth of weight to the base, and making the clamp strong enough to support the lamp sideways would easily make this product a 5/5, even if it meant increasing the price by 10 or 15 bucks.",

I added a bulb intended for that purpose, but it was too bright and am using a simple 2500k led from the local chain store. (It works great for growing Salvinia, Java Moss and Java fern in that configuration fwiw.) Anyway, it is cute and does what I wanted it to.On to the bad: It doesn't have as much range of motion as another similar lamp I bought years ago but it cost half as much too. Also, the base is a lightweight plastic so treat it with care. it feels brittle.Overall, it is cute, functional and affordable. I enjoy it.",

Way too small if you need to cover the whole desk/work area.2) The regular sized bulbs are sticking out of the shade like a proverbial thumb (see the photo).
