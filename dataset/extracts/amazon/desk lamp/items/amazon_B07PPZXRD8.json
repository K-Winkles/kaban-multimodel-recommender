Truly, these are fantastic.The price is super reasonable (and they\u2019d be worth it at twice the price).They are portable.They charge quickly and don\u2019t use up the charge fast, even when you\u2019re using the most powerful setting.You can turn them on and off with a switch at the back to save battery if you aren\u2019t using them for awhile, or during transportation, but to turn them off just at your desk, the tap required is super light. It is really easy to choose the shade and brightness you want.Those multiple light settings are so helpful for different times of day and different eye needs.They are stable and don\u2019t tip over even when you bend light arm BELOW the edge of the desk (I am using it to light a keyboard on a shelf below).Ok, there is one teensy tiny drawback:. if you set your phone on it during a conversation, and the lamp is on, the person on the other end can sometimes hear a hum.Recommend highly!I\u2019ve purchased and repurchased these for years\u2014not because they die because they do NOT die even after years of use\u2014but because we have them at two desks, the kitchen (so ideal for sneaking in for a midnight snack and not waking anyone else), the bathroom (our lights keep flickering in there so we use this instead), and we have given them as gifts, or had them swiped (I\u2019m looking at you, Dad).",

It is perfect for reading at night and not disturbing roommates. It is rechargeable and works cordless so you can maneuver it easily where needed on your desk. When charging, you can fold it up so it takes up very little space. The phone charging feature is a bonus and it serves as a stand as well. I did not read the instructions at first and thought it was defective as the light was dim, but to adjust brightness you just hold your finger on the touch pad. Great lamp!",

                "reviewText": "I've used this product for a little while.I liked that it was small, light, and looked nice on my desk. There are multiple uses for this lamp, including phone charging and being a pencil holder. However, I noticed my phone heated up a bit as I charged it on this, as opposed to the traditional plug-in charge. I'm sure that is implied by wireless charging and likely does not harm the phone, but it is something to know.Also, the pencil holding section holds 3, maybe 4 pencils/pens tops. So, if you want to use it to hold your whole multicolored pen/highlighter/pencil collection, it's not much use for that. If space for a pencil, pen, and one more item is enough for you, it does the job.For being on the smaller side for this type of lamp, I personally thought it was bright. However, for those who are looking for extremely luminous lamps during a dark night, it might not be the one for them. I liked the bright light and warm light modes. Personally, it was plenty bright.It is easy to mold and change the shape, and turn the light the way you want. Again, this lamp does the job and I'm sure it is a good product compared to the other lamps out there. I do recommend getting this product unless you feel any of the minor issues I mentioned are dealbreakers.",

                "reviewText": "We love these little lamps. We even use them as flashlights. The light is bright enough on the dimmest setting for us, but we are light sensitive. (We have 2 of a bigger model, but it is a little too bright for us, and a lot more expensive.) The necks bend and stay at all kinds of helpful angles, if you are careful not to twist them. The button is smooth and easy to keep clean. It is sensitive, and only needs a light tap or a swish of a fingertip to turn on-off, to change color, and to set soft yellow or bright white light. The color of the yellow light isnt like incandescent, but it is a bit warmer than the plain white. So we use the yellow. The usb-a port to charge a cell phone or another device is handy. But, the battery it pulls from is so small, we cant imagine charging a cell phone the whole way, maybe just enough to make an emergency call. But the lamp charge does last for maybe a week on the dimmest setting, many hours a day. And it lets you know it needs a recharge by dimming slowly over the last few hours, not just shutting off. The pen holder is a tiny bit bigger than the one on a bigger model, and it is almost perfect for us.But, each lamp broke itself in different ways. The older one lasted about 3 years, then the charging port came loose. The new one, which we bought in September 2023, started flickering in December because the light itself is loose (charging port is fine). We like this enough that we might try another, if the seller can honor their Transparency agreement with Amazon, without requiring us to give them a street address, which Amazon cautions against doing.",

Then the red light would not stop blinking during charging , even after several hours. Since then I use it for a maximum of 7 hours and it is working fine.",
