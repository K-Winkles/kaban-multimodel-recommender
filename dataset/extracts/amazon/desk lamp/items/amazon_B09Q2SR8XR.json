                "reviewText": "Pros: Lightweight. Plug 'n play (so to speak) it's just 1 piece, no assembly, no surprises! Except one great one-- The side of the box as well as the overview spec sheet inside the box, both list the instructions to supply power to the lamp (e.g phone charger, computer, power bank) and the max current to use (DC 5V \u2248 2-3Amps)Which led me to believe I was going to be supplying my own power source. However, in the box is a charging block, and USB-A to USB-C cable. The block is of course 5V at 2000mA (2A) which = 10Watts. The lamp only uses 8W, and it's really bright- on low it's a good evening reading lamp. On medium, it's enough to illuminate my L shaped corner desk and surrounding area. On high with it set up as base __ flat obviously, vertical arm in the straight 180\u00b0 vertical position, and the lamp at a 90\u00b0 angle, (parallel to the base) sitting at 32\" height, it casts light for 20ft before dimming at all (yes I have been testing it with no other lights on...OH tip: and really- REALLY heed their warnings and \"DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE LAMPS LED'S\" which seems obvious, but it's surprisingly easy to do whilst testing & adjusting it into any of the dozens of possible positions-- It's like that one lady at yoga that can make herself into a pretzel and walk on her feet after they're wrapped over her shoulders, leaving you to just stare & imagine how much you would give for a woman (or dude, no judgment here) with that type of...physical fitness... ;-)So the pros are all good- price is great - touch is very responsive.I had hoped it would be a rechargeable by light, glow in the dark type situation-- u know, like open 3 dot absolute witness primary on a Glock or Wesson that are white by day, but after exposure to daylight they glow green in the dark... but nope.but this lamp-- It's def worth it at what? $15? Less perhaps...Cons: None really-- i mean the led bulbs cannot be replaced, but hey- they cost enough to justify replacing the lamp... if I get two years out of it- great. I know, E-waste, but I imagine it will last longer. (Edit 8 months later: Still as good as day 1)Definitely recommend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

                "reviewText": "Works great for my needs. Lowest setting is too dim to be used for anything practical, but 2nd and 3rd brightness setting are good. (I use the lowest setting as a night time illuminator [yes, i just didnt wanna say 'night light'])No visible ghosting or banding due to the LEDs, the plastic diffuser strip they used does a good enough job.Ability to tilt and rotate the lamp is definitely useful.It's neutral design matches aesthetically to my office area.The light is a pleasant neutral white, not too blue or yellow at all.This one came with an appropriate voltage USB power plug, which is a nice bonus (some of these LED lamps do not).The 5v USB port is handy, though it would have been better to have the port on the sides or front of the unit instead of the rear. I find myself having to move the darn thing just to be able to use the USB port.The USB-C cord included is a bit short, which limits your options as far as where you can place the lamp. I wound up using a 6ft cord I had laying around.For what I paid, I am more than satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new lamp for my home office and this was pretty similar to one I'd had in the past. There is no set up other than pulling it out of the box and unwrapping it. Power cord plugs in to a regular outlet. Has one USB port, which is fine, I use it for a short cable to charge whatever I need at the moment - my phone, my mouse, my keyboard. Light intensity is great - at the highest setting it'll make you go blind if you look at the LCD bulbs, and the lowest setting is good enough to light my desk and work on my laptop. It has a timer, which would be useful for a bedside lamp when you'd be too sleepy to reach over and turn it off. It does have a wireless phone charger, but I'm not using it because I have a phone ring on the back of my phone. Overall quite useful, very economical. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",
