                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a really old desk lamp that just died on me which had similar little dividers (like my old one) to house things I used on my scrapbooking table and just used my mini CFL lightbulb that I already had. I like the on/off button and the gooseneck which can be adjusted to suit your lighting needs. It can also hold your cellphone/tablet which I really don't need to do, but is useful to have it. It was delivered the next day (with Prime) and packaged in the product box which was inside a cardboard box so it was well protected from damage. It's a great price $14.59+tax plus free shipping with Prime and looks just like the pictures. I would recommend it highly!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this lamp for the desk I recently purchased, and I have to say I like it very much. I read a lot of the reviews on here saying how lamps were melted and broken within a few weeks or even one day of use, but I also read many that said they were using the wrong (or otherwise unspecified) light bulb in the lamp. I was confident I could follow directions, so I took a chance and ordered it anyhow. Mine came in orange, and I love the color.I went to the local Walmart to find a bulb and this is the reason it's 4 instead of 5 stars: I had a lot of trouble finding the right size. It specifies 15W MAXIMUM for the bulb, but most of the 15W bulbs were night light sized. I wanted to make sure to get a LED bulb as well; I read those give off less heat and are more energy efficient. The only trouble was that there were several types, and I wasn't sure exactly how to convert a normal 15W bulb to a LED type bulb, since the packaging states that they use far less than 15W to run a \"60W equivalent\" (or less, there was a variety). I ended up purchasing a GE 60W Replacement, that runs on 11W. I figured I would try it out and if it melted my lamp or didn't work or fit, I would just be out a little money and I would buy a different lamp I could fit the bulb into directly from Walmart. When I brought it home and put it in the lamp, I kept a very close eye on it to make sure it wasn't getting warm or making the shade warp in any way, and I'm happy to report it was fine, even after 3 hours of use that night and a few hours (at minimum) per day since then, and it is running fine and not warped, melted, or broken in any way.Make sure you READ the instructions and FOLLOW them, and this product should work just fine. It comes in nice colors, and it is a good size to fit on a desk that doesn't have much space. (Mine is a compact desk, so the organizer area was just a huge bonus to help me keep my things in order.) There isn't a ton of room in the organizer compartments, but it's nice that it holds a tablet or a large smartphone so you can watch things on the side of your desk if you are working at the computer.Overall I like this product and I would order it again! If I could make one change, it would only be adding a chart to the instructions to convert different types of bulbs so you know what to buy. That was a bit of a pain, but worth it in the end.",
