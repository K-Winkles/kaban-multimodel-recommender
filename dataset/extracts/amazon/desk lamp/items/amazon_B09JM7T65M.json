                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the AFROG Multifunctional LED Desk Lamp while searching for a reliable LED desk lamp, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. This lamp offers a multitude of features that cater to various lighting preferences and provides a convenient user experience.One of the standout features of this LED desk lamp is its versatility in offering different types of white light. Whether you prefer a warm and cozy ambiance or a cool and bright workspace, you have the freedom to choose the perfect lighting setting to suit your needs. Additionally, the lamp provides a wide range of brightness options, allowing you to easily adjust the lighting intensity to your liking.What sets this desk lamp apart is its convenient memory function. Once you set your preferred lighting color and brightness, the lamp remembers your last settings. This means that whenever you turn it on, it automatically returns to the exact same configuration, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. It's a fantastic feature that adds convenience to your daily routine.While my experience with the lamp was generally positive, I did encounter an issue with the initial unit I received from Amazon. It failed to turn on and was non-functional. However, I must commend Amazon's exceptional customer service, as they promptly replaced the faulty unit without any hassle. Kudos to Amazon for their excellent support!Despite this minor hiccup, I wholeheartedly recommend the AFROG Multifunctional LED Desk Lamp to anyone in need of an adjustable lighting solution for their workspace. With its impressive range of lighting options, convenient memory function, and Amazon's reliable customer service, this lamp is a reliable choice that won't disappoint. Two thumbs up!",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Poor design",
                "reviewText": "This lamp is poorly designed. It does not come with its own power supply so you have to either use a wall transformer with USB output/charging capacity or a computer USB connection. Seriously, what good is a lamp that you have to have something extra that doesn't come in the box to make it work?The power switch dimmer combination is terrible. You have to tap it 5 times, slowly, to get to the maximum light setting. If you try to do it quickly it either doesn't take the tap or you overshoot and turn the lamp off by accident and have to start the process all over again. It would be much better if the first tap was full brightness and you then adjusted down from there.I don't know about how other people might use this thing but I use it to make light, so I want full brightness all the time. Even on the highest setting it's not very bright. It gives off light but not very much light. Compared to another similar cheap lamp I own this is about half as bright.Unless you use the \"cool\" setting everything else is just dimmer. Most of the \"warmer\" settings are therefore unusable.People have complained about longevity, that the lamp doesn't last very long. I just got it so I can't speak to that. If it dies prematurely I'll come back and edit this review.I had a desk lamp that died on me after about 5 years of service so I was in a hurry to replace it with something cheap quickly. I won't ever buy this brand of lamp again and will eventually replace it with something better. Then I'll move this lamp somewhere that I can still use it but unlike my desk I don't need something reasonably bright.The good news is that this lamp is so cheap that I don't care if I have to throw it away. The bad news is that you don't even get what you're paying for even though it doesn't cost much.",

Only issue I had with it is when I have it on low and go to turn it off at night, it has to get brighter and brighter before it shuts off. Usually I'm half asleep when I do cut it off at night and then the brightness is very alarming and hurts my eyes. I would like one that the off and on button just cut it off and not made it brighter.",
