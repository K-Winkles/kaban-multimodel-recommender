                "reviewText": "I might buy another to soften the shadow. I bought this as a work light over my desk where I occasionally work with electronics, in a very small area of about 1ft x 1ft (yes, I do have a well-lit an much larger workbench with wires and cables all over it). It is plenty bright enough, but when I am probing, or attaching a grabber to a wire or terminal the sharp shadow could be an issue. If it is, I will probably get another one. I only need the cool white (not the super cool blue light, or the yellow light) mode. If you're reading printed material though, that yellower mode might be best.The light source is smaller diameter than I expected. It's about 4.5cm across (smaller than 2 inches). So, it isn't too different from a clamp-on flashlight as far as the beam it casts. Since the LEDs are close to the surface, it's pretty wide-angle. It produces a little heat, and is noticeably warm at the top of the bell-shaped hood, but not hot. The clamp is sturdy, and applies plenty of pressure to keep it from moving around when adjusted. And the gooseneck is about 18 inches long, and surprisingly stiff, so it stays put.I might buy another and have no hesitation about recommending this product,",

I keep it plugged into USB charger most of the time. But when the lights go out, I use it with a portable charger for extra light. It does the trick. The cool, white and warm white settings are useful, but I blend the two together and turn the brightness level down and it\u2019s very pleasing to do tasks by. I use it a lot when I\u2019m on my tablet at night.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great light, I have used it on multiple surfaces, clamped to my desk, clamped to the back of my chair, the clamp is very strong and the body very flexible but stays where you put it. There are a range of light type, like white, yellow and various brightness settings all on the handy little controller built into the flex. I found the price point reasonable, didn't go for the cheapest or most expensive, it does everything I want it to and was very easy to unbox and use!!",

                "reviewText": "Lamp is very well done, strong and stylish. You could change light brightness and light temperature/color what is amazing as I prefer stronger white light for reading and not as intensive and more warm color for lightening room on evening time.Originally I've planned to use it in my camper van but is so cool that it would be my bedside light in my bedroom and if i need i take it with me to use in my van.I'm very delighted this product ***** stars minimum!",
