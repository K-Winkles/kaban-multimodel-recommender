                "reviewText": "This lamp fits perfectly on my desk between my monitor and computer - others were difficult to position in the right place to not get glare on my screen while I had the lamp on. I also LOVE the range of brightness (most lamps are too bright for my eyes - I can dial this down to a comfortable level for me) and the different types of light (blue, sunlight, white) are wonderful. Sometimes I need to dial it up to read printed stuff and other times I just need a little light to be able to see my keyboard keys in the dark. The ability to have options is so NICE! Totally recommend this desk lamp especially for the low price. It looks great too.",

                "reviewText": "They promote it as an \"eye-caring\" lamp. It would have been except for a foolish, utterly unnecessary purely cosmetic design feature that is actually very HARD on the eyes.....For purely decorative purposes they coated the vertical bar and the horizontal light bar with a paint that simulates a sparkling aluminum surface. If you place the lamp normally (which is in front of you) on the desk, when you turn the lamp on some light from the light bar shines on the surface facing you of the sparkling aluminum-like vertical bar. This bright glaring lit-up vertical bar is very hard on the eyes and very distracting. Photo of the glaring reflected light is attached. You can see the bright area at the upper several inches of the bar.Otherwise the lamp seems well constructed. It wouldn't hurt, though, if the base had an extra pound or more of weight.I will be returning the light because of the glaring reflection unless I can stop it with some dull tape to cover the area of the reflection.",
