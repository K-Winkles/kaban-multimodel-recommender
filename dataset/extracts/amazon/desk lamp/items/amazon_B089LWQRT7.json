Slightly shorter than my 24\" on a stand. If you don't care about that then keep reading...This is GREAT - not one bad thing to say about it -It's a lot more solid/durable feeling and attractive than I anticipated -Base is about the size of an 7 inch tablet pc - nice small footprint on my desk -The hues are very tasteful - I've found a few of them very nice for my desk ambience -Despite other reviews, the brightness is great. -Versatility - LOVE the swivel/position adjustment capabilities. -Wireless phone charger seems to work as advertised although I don't use itI have a pretty dark office, and my primary goal was to get a lamp/lighting source on my desk that I could also use to see the keys on the musical keyboard next to the desk.

My first lamp wireless charger stopped working within a week so I got a replacement from Amazon, the 2nd lamp wireless charger lasted about three weeks before it too stopped working. I contact Amazon who advised me I was outside the 30 day window to return it and I needed to contact the seller..When I contacted the seller via a link provided by Amazon I asked if I can get a replacement, their answer a day later was \u201cof course\u201d and nothing else so I asked again how do we do the replacement, do I need to ship it first, do I get a shipping label, how does it work?, a day later the answer was, \u201cuse the Amazon return window\u201d and nothing else, I reply again that I don\u2019t understand what you mean Amazon sent me to you for the transaction, another day goes by and there answer was \u201cis in your order\u201d.Even though the seller was answering they were providing as little information as possible and did not seem they wanted to help. I contacted Amazon explained the situation and asked for a refund. I will not buy anything from them ever again.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I was hoping it would be for my home office. I was kind of expecting to be disappointed about something or another with it, but it's everything they advertised and works great! Super sleek design and delivers lovely, even light everywhere under the light bar. I love the temperature adjustment...provides lots of variation for my workspace. The brightness goes from very dim to bright with an easy touch of the interface.My only criticisms are:1. The wireless charger isn't quite strong enough to charge my work iPhone through the Otter Box case. It looks like it can ALMOST do it (the charging indicator blinks) but not quite. I've just removed the case while I'm at home with the phone and the problem is solved.2. I wish the platform to charge the phone was slightly raised to lift the phone away from the touch controls. The controls get pressed by the phone when you're charging if you don't place the phone perpendicular to the base. But if you can get your phone to charge away from the controls, you're good.All in all, REALLY happy with this purchase!",
