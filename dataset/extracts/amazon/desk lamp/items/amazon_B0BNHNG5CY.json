The different levels of brightness and various light modes are additional features that make this lamp worth buying. Having the options of turning on the center light only, the outer lights only, or all three are rather useful and convenient. Good quality and the clamp stays sturdily in place when moving the lamp to one's preference. The foot print of the clamp is relatively small, which is a plus.One recommendation would be to have two buttons controlling the level of brightness instead of one, one button to increase and the other to decrease the level. Cycling through the brightness levels can be a little annoying, but not enough to enjoy the desk lamp.",

The buttons are capacitive touch but they are very responsive and have reacted to every touch so far. I have only just started using this light but overall, I am very pleased with it!

There are controls to adjust brightness and cool/warmth of the lights and the main light and wing lights have separate controls so there are so many combinations of lighting based on need.I have a tall, wide monitor so I was worried about the lamp being tall enough to reach over it but the lamp does and has room to spare.

Then the brightness and whiteness can be adjusted. Probably my Best Buy on Amazon this year so far. Once in awhile find a really good item on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a fluorescent lamp back in 1964 when a university student, needing good light for many hours of study. The manufacturer is still in business but has not really updated that product model, and after 60 odd years there is a lot of nostalgia linked to condemning my old light to the recycler. But the world moves on and when I saw this light, realized it was exactly what was needed. It is designed to light my whole desk from back to front and side to side effectively. I mounted it on my desk, but my computer is nearby on a table, and this light can be swung around easily so that there is good light when working in front of the computer and doing data entry. I haven't settled on a light colour yet, but the variety is interesting to test out to see which is most effective for my own eyes. I recommend this product.",
