                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this desk lamp! I was looking for a small budget-friendly LED lamp for my desk because the lighting in my room is almost non-existent when I'm doing work on my computer. I read through the reviews and without hesitation I purchased TWO of these lamps (one for me, and one for mom.) We received them the next day (we have prime) and couldn't believe how lightweight they were and the cool features it has! LED dimming lights, foldable and swivel design, night light, USB charging port, 10W wireless charging (which works great!), and a digital alarm clock with the date and temperature! It\u2019s a wonderful desk or bedside lamp if you are looking for simple and sleek. Highly recommend!!",

When it first turns on it sounds a bit Chinese honestly like the sound that it makes but once you get it going, it\u2019s so functional and it\u2019s amazing. I love it so so much. And it\u2019s easy to travel with too, if you decide to travel, which, sometimes I take it with me. There\u2019s two different spots you can put your phone to stand up and the wireless charging works phenomenally. It\u2019s really simple and easy to use. The instructions are very very clear. I love the different settings for the nightlight and for the lamp itself. In my opinion it\u2019s definitely worth the purchase especially for the price .",

                "reviewText": "This is a very good looking an functional desktop lamp. It came well packaged, and after plugged it in was a breeze to set it up. The vertical screen has a nice and modern look, it shows time, date and temperature. You can dim everything, the backlight of the screen, the main light and the night light (the small light that it is on the base of the lamp). The main light of this lamp has 5 temperature settings, going from cool light to warm light. On top of all this features, you get an USB port Type A for charge only in the back of the base and a Qi 10W wireless charger. I put my iPhone 13 pro on the lamp base and it started to charge immediately. A small blue LED light turns on as soon as the wireless charger start to work. The overall weight of the lamp is light, it is made of hard plastic with a leather texture on the surface. I am very happy with this purchase, worth every dollar.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this lamp for my dining room table for when I'm doing homework. I have a ceiling light directly above the table but I needed more. I've purchased a few in the past at about this same price on Amazon and I didn't like them much and with a recent move, the one I mainly used got damaged. This one had some extra features which I particularly liked and as a reviewer of this product this is my opinion:Setting the clock and date is easy. The backlight featuring this information can be adjusted for brightness, The temperature feature is nice and the wireless charging station works. I have a phone case with a beaded embellished pop-socket so it doesn't charge with the case on, but I did take my phone out of the case, placed it on the charging station and it works just fine.A couple cool added features that I like more than the ones I've purchased in the past is that the plastic casing for the light has a \"leather\" visual texture which to me, looks a bit nice, especially in comparison to the one I had before (that my nail salon has too and it just looked cheap). There is also a night light feature with intensity 3 settings that emit light from the base, which actually looks very nice. I tend to keep it on overnight because it makes for a good night light for those late-night bathroom trips!For a reasonably-priced desk lamp, this thing checks all the boxes. Very glad I made this purchase and I recommend you do to!",

The instructions were not great and that is my only \"gripe\". But once it was finally set up I really like it. It is not terribly bright but it is bright enough. It looks nice and I like having the clock, temp and other info visible.",
