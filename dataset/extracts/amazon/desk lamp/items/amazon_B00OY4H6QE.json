                "reviewText": "SEEKING A QUALITY DESKTOP LAMP:After attempting to find a descent LED lamp from Walmart, Target, Office depot and Best Buy, I gave up and continued my search on Amazon. I wanted a solidly built desktop lamp that functioned well and looked nice. So I ordered the \"Newhouse Lighting 9W Executive LED Desk Lamp w/ Touch Dimming Control & USB Charging Port, Black.\" Well, that turned out to be a huge disappointment. I ordered two of them for each of the two desks I use in my study room. The diffusers began to delaminate and become unglued, not on one, but both of my lamps. I returned them immediately since I was far from impressed from the build quality, which leads me up to this item.TROND HALO:-First Impressions: The packaging was descent in that the item was completely protected. Upon first inspection, I noticed the texture of the lamp was in a matte black rubber finish. I greatly appreciated the finish considering it looked much more quality and substantial than my previous experiences with painted aluminum and glory black paint that scratches at the slightest touch.-Lighting: The lighting for this lamp is on the cooler end of the spectrum. The lighting on this lamp is well thought out. There is a diffuser panel that does not have the led lights directly behind it but off to the sides like the Amazon Kindle. This significantly reduces harsh glare off of pages when trying to read under the lamp. Compared to my previous experiences of other desktop lamps, I would highly recommend this lamp for what it is. My only regret is that I did not purchase the other Trond model similar to this (TROND Halo 11W Versatile LED Desk Lamp\" that allows for warmer lighting.-Input: There is a touch sensitive light switch that is very responsive. Worked well for me and allows for various levels of light output.I gave this item five stars because it's well thought out and designed to do exactly what it advertises with a great build and light quality.Update-March 13, 2016:Recall that I mentioned, \"\"My only regret is that I did not purchase the other Trond model similar to this (TROND Halo 11W Versatile LED Desk Lamp\" that allows for warmer lighting.\"\"So I did purchase the \"newer model.\" I prefer this older model as it's actually brighter in it's white light (\"work\" mode as it's called on the newer model). The newer model has different variations of color warmth, but at the cost of reduced light output in the \"relaxing\" (yellow light) and \"work\" (white light like this 10w halo) mode; \"reading\" mode is the only mode that allows 11W of light on the newer model... so you are only running around 5.5 watts max on the new model in \"work\" mode that offers the same color light as this lamp. This is because there are two sets of led lights that produce a warm and white light in the newer 11W model. In either work or relaxing mode, you are only running one of two LED strips. It's only in reading mode that you have both LED strips (yellow and white) running and getting the full 11W of lighting.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp is a real game-changer for me. I saved a boatload of money by buying this instead of installing a pendant lamp over my dining room table on my high, slanted ceiling. My decorative lamps are great for dining, but not for reading, writing or crafting. This little lamp is elegantly unobtrusive & doesn't clash with my decor, but is highly functional when I need extra light, day or night. I love the feel & sturdy flexibility of the 'arm', clever built-in 'temperature' & brightness controls, and the fact that it plugs right into an outlet. Highly recommend this product! Buy it! You can't go wrong!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: KNOCKING ONE STAR OFF MY 5-STAR REVIEW. Still a fabulous little lamp, but after only a few days' use in one spot (no moving around), the DC power adapter seems to have shorted out. I happened to have another one lying around, so substituting was easier than the hassle of returning the whole lamp. If this should happen to you, you may find that ordering a 12-volt, 1-amp, 2.1mm DC Power Adapter for a few bucks is a better choice for you, too. Here's one example: 12V DC Power Adapter Supply 2.1mm 1A, CCTV ORIGINAL REVIEW, ALL STILL VALID: It just arrived so I can only talk about its style and utility, not its longevity, but this is a really nice lamp! I was after an unobtrusive black task/table lamp to brighten a dark corner and provide some extra task lighting in a small space, and this one is excellent. The rubberized finish is matte and velvelty, and doesn't show fingerprints (unless you've been eating bacon. Ask me how I know). The LEDs are covered by a diffuser, so all you see is a bright rectangle, not rows of little square LEDs.I love the smooth, featureless surface. The dimmer control and on-off are invisible--just slide your finger along the groove on the stand. Faint red lights indicate which dimmer level you're on, and there's one always on to show you where the on switch is. But it's not one of those annoying bright LEDs that seem to make our living rooms into Christmas trees at night--just a very faint dot.Speaking of the dimmer, it ranges from a low, moody glow to a seriously bright task-light, with multiple steps in between. The light itself is a fairly cool, daylight white, great for color perception.The transformer isn't super-huge--it needs an end outlet on my multi-outlet surge protector, but it only takes up one spot.The base is a bit lightweight, but then so is the whole lamp, so it's reasonably stable. You might have to hold it down with one hand while adjusting the neck upward. The neck adjusts easily and stays where you put it. I guess if I have one quibble, it's that the TROND logo is printed in white on the top surface of the base, detracting a little from the all-black look, but it certainly doesn't affect the function, quality, or overall sleek style.",

I also like the fact that it is turned on and the brightness is adjusted by running your finger along a groove in the lamp base. This makes it very easy to turn on in the dark because it's easy to do by touch",

                "reviewText": "I am impressed by this lamp. My old halogen bulb lamp finally stopped working. This one fit in the same space on my desk and has a flexible neck that lets me aim the light just where I need it. I've never had the option of three types of light styles before and after some time found the best setting for each task. From crisp white for reading small print to medium for writing and yellow-ish for relaxing ambient light. I might even point it at the ceiling in that mode and turn the adjustable brightness way down. So, minimalist design, lots of flexibility (literally) and a variety of settings make this one a winner for me.",
