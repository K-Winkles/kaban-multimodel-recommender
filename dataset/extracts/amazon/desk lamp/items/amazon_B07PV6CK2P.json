                "reviewText": "We setup a pop-up arts exhibition in kind of a dimly-lit space, and needed the aid of some lighting to show the artworks better. We gave these a try. The painting artworks were setup on easels, and we clamped the lights on the hooks on top of the easels. The longer neck allowed us to extend the lights outward to put a fairly even light on the paintings and drawings. With the 3 color settings and the ability to brighten or dim the light, the results are pretty good. The downside is since they operate on USB power, we had to get a bunch of charger blocks and extension cords to run the powers to where they are. I guess it would have been the same scenario if the lights could be plugged directly into regular sockets. We just wouldn't have to buy the charger blocks. It worked out fairly well for this exhibit.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with it. I literally just got it delivered about an hour ago and couldn't wait to try it out and it does exactly what it says.Check the description for the exact measurements but for me its the perfect size. The clamp is strong so its pretty solid when clamped onto something. The flexible \"gooseneck\" is pretty firm so it holds its position really well. The different light options work well and so overall I'm really happy with it.There are a lot of similar items and I think I only chose this one as the price was fair enough.",
