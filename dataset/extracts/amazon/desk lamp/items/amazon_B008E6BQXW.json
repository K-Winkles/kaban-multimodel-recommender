I rated light weight 3 stars because it is very sturdy with a heavy base. I don't imagine anyone carrying this around for any length of time that its weight would matter.",

                "reviewText": "Next month I will have had this lamp for 12 years. There were periods where I didn't use it very often (worked out of an office, so no need for my desk lamp), but over the last couple of years I have worked from home exclusively and this little guy has been put to work. I live in the Pacific Northwest and the months from November through May can be pretty dreary. This lamp illuminates my desk far better than the glow of my monitors or the lighting from around the room, reduces eye strain, and makes the dark days a little brighter (pun intended). I have yet to replace the bulb, but it's great to see that this model is still being sold and replacements are still available if needed. As others have mentioned, the lamp's base does have a large footprint, so it takes up a bit more desktop real estate than I would like, but that doesn't make me love this lamp any less. It's not fancy (I have the black plastic model), but it blends in with my black monitors and computer/network hardware just nicely.If you're looking for a nice, bright lamp that will help you see your tasks, hobbies, reading, etc., and don't mind choosing function over form, look no further.",

                "reviewText": "I have had a number of these, both desk and floor models, all flourescent, for many years. They're cheap enough where a few have been given away when I moved and no longer had room.A couple showed up with scratches or other defects but Amazons return/exchange process is so easy.But the light these things throw is great. I suffer from depression and they help my mood and energy so much. I've brought one to jobs where the overhead flourescent lighting was dingy yellow or too blue.My wife now works from home and the desk and floor model are on all day morning to night with no issues. Thousands of hours of use on the original bulbs.I want to hate them because they aren't the most pleasing in form and the desk model's base requires desk space but they work so well and you can't beat the price.",

                "reviewText": "Came in plain shipping box, no internal product box. No owner manual, just some instructions on the box with the included bulb. Bulb didn't work when installed with electrical specifications visible so I flipped it over so \"made in China\" was visible and it worked. That shouldn't matter so I assume it just didn't click quite into place for me and I didn't notice. Light is bright but lacks the warm tone of my other sunlight/light therapy lamp. I'll probably keep it but I doubt I'll buy another. I thought it would have the same spectrum but it doesn't.",

My complaint is that the light appears to be pure white, and has a very cold cold COLD feel to it. It is also VERY BRIGHT and only has one setting. I have a sunrise alarm clock that gives a wonderfully warm feeling simulated sunrise lighting. I was hoping for a lamp that would provide a similar type of lighting.I will be returning this item and continuing my research on lamps that provide lighting that helps with sunlight deprivation and also provides a nice, warm feel to the lighting, and hopefully some controls for adjustable brightness.",
