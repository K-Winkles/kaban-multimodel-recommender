I like it.The on/off switch stopped working after a year for me. Others also reported the same issue. I ended up replacing the entire controller and switch to a regular light switch. For $10 it is a good buy, but the design flaw is still unacceptable imho. The little switch that keeps dying is worth probably 3 cents, why not replace it for a 5 cent version that would actually last?",

                "reviewText": "I just received this lamp today. First the good. It is very flexible, and the neck is very strong. The lamp will not \"droop\". Second, the clamp is very strong and is metal so it won't break. Third, I like all of the adjustments and colors, although to me the \"warm\" color is very yellow and I will probably never use it.Now for the bad. This light is not nearly as bright as I expected it would be. It's probably only about 1/2 as bright as it needs to be (in my opinion) to really brightly light up my desk. With lights on in the room or a lot of daylight, you can't tell that the lamp is even on even at full brightness. For my purposes I guess it will work. My room is fairly dark and I just need it to light my computer keyboard and small surrounding surface.This light would be better suited for attaching to a headboard for night reading or things like that.All in all, it is a nice light that I guess I'll keep. I spent too much time researching to come up with this one... I don't want to do it all over again. But I do wish it was 2x brighter.4 days later: I returned the light. For me, it was just not viable as a desk lamp. I purchased a different light that is 10W and it is much brighter.",

I wish the lamp got a bit brighter (so I can use it as a meaningful light source for filming) but it does well as a study and work light.
