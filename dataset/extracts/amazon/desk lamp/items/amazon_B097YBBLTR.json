It's easy to use, but I wish the directions were a little bit more clear when putting it together. In addition, one of the screws was not long enough for the connection, so I had to get another screw to use. I still rate it highly though.",

                "reviewText": "Wanted to buy a lamp since my previous one broke. I had a hard time at first. I learned (in theory) that you do not need a charging box to plug into the usb cable. If you have an extension cord or even a multi outlet box/plug that has built in usb plugs. it\u2019s best to plug it into those usb outlets instead of using a charging box. my lamp would flicker and eventually turn off. Not sure if mines is defective but it works perfectly fine after i left it in the usb plug in (without the box). it\u2019s very simple to use and has a lot of different light options to choose from. I am rating it a 4 star because i wish it was more brighter.",

                "reviewText": "I buy a lot of lights. I have had a lot of lights that once they arrive they aren\u2019t what I expected. Very different in person then in pictures on line. Well this desk light is a lot better in person. It really serves us well for working, drafting, drawing, sewing, reading. I like the level of light control it offers, how it dims, quality of hues. It\u2019s very pleasant. It also helps me get great lighting for live Zoom meetings. The light swivels and you can under light your face, as well as have one on the side, so you can achieve better lighting if you want to look more natural on a zoom meeting. I didn\u2019t buy it for that but it\u2019s an added bonus. That I can adjust a light under my iPod, under the camera and my face, out of frame. And it looks so much better than over head lighting that causes shadows. I also like that if you have two people working at a table one person can use on side and swivel it while the other person another side. Low energy usage a bonus. Modern Scandinavian design ascetic. I bought two and will buy more for other homes and business as this light is the perfect balance of form and function.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp not only swivels in different directions, but you can changed the hue of the light to protect your eyes. It truly makes a difference. Most desk lamps advertise USB connections and the like. I have them on my PC and don't need more on a lamp. The other lamps also never have a long enough stem to get them up over your monitors and the base is so small, the lamps get knocked over. Then they are always in your way. This one fits nicely between my two monitors and reaches over the top. The base is slim and never gets in the way; but its wide enough to give the lamp stability. You do not have any screen glare from the light. I usually rotate it towards me when I want more light on my desktop area for depositing checks remotely or similar things. I bought another for my son because he like it so much when he saw it on my desk. It will be the last lamp you buy.",

It was easy to setup and thought it put out a decent amount of light. A few months later, after using it approximately 40 hours per week, the light is very dim and really doesn't add any light to my workspace. I plan to message the seller to see if replacement bulbs can be purchased and if they can't then it certainly is not worth the price for the length of time it worked.",
