Looks good.Cons - the water fill gauge is easy to see, but not when actually filling the machine. Because of where mine is located, I can actually see through the gauge from inside, at least when nearly full, but some of that is because of my under counter lighting. - There is a lot of plastic. The machine seems sturdy enough, and the machine was very affordable.All in all, a very nice, affordable and capable coffee machine. I would not want a home machine with a reservoir, unless it was a single pot-full. I am the only coffee drinker in the house normally, and only make a full pot every other day.",

                "reviewText": "Once the time is set and the start time is programmed, it's so convenient to set up at night for the morning automated perk time. Past coffee pots like this were difficult to remove the coffee basket without burning your fingers. This one allows easy removal of the used coffee basket without burning your fingers. Setting the start time the night before is also easy. The coffee perk time is quite good. Great value for the money. Unless you're looking for something ultra fancy and expensive, this is it. A very good coffee pot.",

                "reviewText": "The product does what it's supposed to. However, these things I don't like:* Water container is blocked by the sprayer in the middle, making it hard to pour water into receptacle without spilling or needing a funnel.* Somehow coffee grounds get all over the filter holder at top edge.* Most irritating is the pot itself refuses to pour without a portion of your coffee running down the side of the mug. Mess everytime. I somewhat remedy this with a knife or straw at the pour spot to guide water.In general, this is yet another cheap plastic product. Rather than using a reliable durable metal, we get plastic. This seems to be unavoidable without making your own coffee maker unfortunately. I did not have these problems with the Mr Coffee maker. However, I had to scrap the working Mr Coffee maker because I couldn't find a compatible decanter. Amazon sold me one that was too short which then allowed the flow to continue when the pot was removed.",

I originally purchased one on May 2022 and didn't start using until recently (out of warranty by this time) and unfortunately it stopped working shortly after starting to use it. With that said I reluctantly repurchased one to replace the last one due to the overall height and our low clearance above the counter tops. I hope this one performs better than the original unit we purchased.",
