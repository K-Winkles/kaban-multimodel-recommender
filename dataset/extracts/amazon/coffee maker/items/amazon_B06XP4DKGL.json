                "reviewText": "I've been the proud owner of this coffee pot for a year and a half now, and I'm delighted to share my thoughts on its performance. In a nutshell, it has proven to be a dependable companion, consistently delivering a great coffee experience without a hitch.What immediately stood out to me is the seamless functionality. From day one to today, I haven't encountered a single issue \u2013 a testament to its quality construction and design. The coffee pot's consistent performance has become an integral part of my daily routine, ensuring a fresh and satisfying brew each morning.One feature I particularly appreciate is the well-thought-out automatic shut-off timer. While at first, I wished the pot would remain on until manually turned off, I've come to realize the benefits of this two-hour timer. It's a great safety feature, especially for those moments when forgetfulness might strike. Besides, it's a gentle reminder that our busy lives sometimes need a nudge to ensure we don't accidentally leave appliances running.I must admit, though, there are times when I long for that extended brewing session. On occasions when I'd love to come back for second or even third cups a few hours later, the timer does have its limitations. However, looking at the bigger picture, this limitation is a small price to pay for the peace of mind and energy savings it provides.In conclusion, this coffee pot has proven its reliability time and time again. Its consistent performance and well-designed features make it a worthwhile addition to any coffee lover's kitchen. Whether you're seeking a hassle-free brewing experience or appreciate the safety of an automatic shut-off, this coffee pot strikes a balance that's hard to beat.",

                "reviewText": "I researched and bought the four best-review brands I could find, at the same time so I could compare. The tank is as wide-open as I've ever seen, so that's great for fast pouring and for easy cleaning. Coffee is now noticeably smoother - maybe old one had too much build up, or it just does a great brewing job. It's much quieter than my old Black and Decker. The position and angle of the digital display makes it easy to read and use, although I wish it was a bit brighter, but that's okay! Carafe handle is comfy. Just for fun, I ordered a metal mesh filter basket and charcoal water filters from Amazon. Maybe the water filters will help reduce calcium build up and retain the smooth flavor. Great product for this price range!",

I have been using this coffee maker for over a week, and it is PERFECT! The pot has a slightly longer pour spout so when I fill the water reservoir it doesn't spill water on the counter top and it doesn't leak coffee when I fill my cup. If I forget to turn it off, it does so automatically after 2 hours. I can easily clean the water reservoir area (something I couldn't do with my previous Mr. Coffee Maker). I am extremely happy with this purchase.",

Don't really need the extra features myself anyway.And don't see myself wanting to spend more on a machine when this works perfectly and has so far been reliable. I've been using it out of the box since June 8th, had to get a new one during lockdown I tend to pack a lot of grinds, and it still had yet to back up. Or include any errors. Something my old machine was prone to and was more expensive.Wouldn't have been able to survive going back to work after lockdown! And didn't have a huge budget at all, as I wasn't working. Also love having a brew auto timed for before I wake up! Very happy I stumbled upon this machine and I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
