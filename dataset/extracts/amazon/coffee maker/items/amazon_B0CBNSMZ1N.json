AND it comes with everything you need to fully enjoy the FP coffee experience. It's the perfect size for 2 cups of coffee, and yet is small enough NOT to take up a lot of space - even when traveling (if you're so inclined!). It comes with all of the necessary parts, including a spare metal filter pad - and it EVEN includes a perfectly functional sponge cleaning wand, which makes cleaning it a breeze! And just as importantly, it's well made with quality parts, it looks great, and the feel you get with its smooth plunging action is pure satisfaction. I am VERY pleased with this purchase, and would heartily recommend it for any French Press Coffee lovers!",

The filter works really well and my coffee comes out smooth every time. I follow the directions for ratios that came with it, but added about a half scoop more (2.5 scoops for the entire french press). It fills my 16oz mug. The size of the press is perfect as it is small enough that doesn't take up too much space and can fit in your cabinets if needed.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see a sponge bottle brush included in the package. The coffee press is small, so it is hard to reach in to remove coffee grounds, but I use a spoon to scoop them out for recycling and then proceed to wash it with the brush provided. It is also a perfect travel size, if you prefer your coffee pressed while on the road or vacation. The container frame is well made and holds the glass in place very well. The handle is comfortable to pour and well secured. Great little coffee press to have.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about this French Press but wow, it is a wonderful quality product. Not only does it look elegant, it is also constructed with high quality at a cheap price. It comes with a cleaning brush and extra screens.There is a trick to using a French Press to not get any sludge or grinds in your cup. Warm the carafe with about 2 scoops of medium ground, or finely ground, coffee and wait 4 minutes. Then slowly plunge, making sure no coffee grinds are seen catching on the filter. If this happens, simply raise the plunger and again slowly plunge down and I mean slowly taking about 2 minutes to plunge all the way. This method leaves no grinds or sludge.Fantastic product and seller. Remember that this item comes in it's own manufacturers packaging.Thank you.",
