Fits perfectly into the mouth of the jars I frequently brew coffee into. I have had it for several months and it has not worn down on me. It's made of decent ceramic material and I love the shade of light pink. I usually only need to rinse it out after every use and deep clean every once in awhile. Simple to use, just heat up water on the stove in a kettle to brew with! Good staple for pour overs. :)",
