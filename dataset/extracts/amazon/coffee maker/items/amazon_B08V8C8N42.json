                "reviewText": "First I need to get something off my chest about some leaving negative reviews. Remember, you\u2019re reviewing a product, not shipping problems, or doesn\u2019t fit your space, or problems with Amazon, or cord color. You should measure your space beforehand. Don\u2019t give a poor review because it doesn\u2019t fit your space after you get it! Do your research first! Now, onward. Have been a Keurig user for more years than I can remember. My most recent Keurig, before this one, was K-Supreme Plus. One morning it just quit. No nothing. I really liked the Multistream Technology, and that\u2019s what I wanted again, but slimmer to fit our small space. That\u2019s what I like about this K-Slim. Fits better, and I still get that great tasting coffee, and it dispenses 12oz. size too. It\u2019s really quiet and fast brewing. One other thing to think about is that there\u2019s no internal heating tank. Water comes straight from the reservoir, to the pump/heater, to the K-cup. No water sitting in an internal tank getting stale if it\u2019s not being used for a few days, weeks or months if you\u2019re away. I recommend getting the charcoal filter in the reservoir. Isn\u2019t included, as it used to be, but I had mine from the old Keurig. Keep it cleaned and descaled and it should serve you well. Cheers!",

So I decided to buy a new coffee maker but the Nespressos had gone up in price. The keurig K Slim was on sale so I decided to try it. First thing I noticed was the smallest cup was 8 oz. I was used to having 2 lungo espressos each morning. The K cup 8 oz brew is just too weak for me. I\u2019ve tried at least 3 brands of dark roast cups and can\u2019t get it strong enough. I tried shutting it off before it completes the full brew but it really doesn\u2019t put out the full flavor. Some of the keurigs have a 4 oz option and/or a Strong Brew option but not on the Slim. Wish I had noticed that. It\u2019s too late to return it now. I\u2019m satisfied with the looks, space on the counter and water tank.",
