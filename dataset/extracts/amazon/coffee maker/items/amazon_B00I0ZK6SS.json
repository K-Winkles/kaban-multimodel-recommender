                "reviewText": "This coffee maker replaces single cup brewer (non-pod). The advantage is it brews into a reservoir rather than a cup and is programmable for coffee on demand. I can brew, select a time to keep the coffee hot, and grab a fresh cup at my discretion. With the single cup brewer, if I started brewing, but then was distracted, and the cup had to sit for just a few minutes, the coffee would get cold. Now, it does not matter if I don't start drinking as soon as t is brewed. Easy to use and clean. It is so simple, I recommend cleaning after each use, once it has cooled and there is also an auto-clean feature. Comes with a few flat bottom paper filters, but you can order the re-usable gold tone filter. 3 cups made about enough to almost fill an 11 oz. mug. 8 cups made about 2 1/2cups using a 20 oz mug. As you dispense coffee, a light illuminates the cup in use. The gauge is especially helpful. This was a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this is by far the best coffee maker ever made, in my opinion. I have used other \"coffee on demand\" brands, but the Cuisinart DCC-3000FR 12 Cup Coffee on Demand coffee maker is an all around great design. I love the side water tank with the replaceable water filter; you see exactly how much water to add for the number of cups you want to brew (which means no wasted coffee going down the drain every day!). To gauge the number of cups on similar coffee makers, I would have to pour the water into a measuring cup because I found it was hard to see the indicators marked inside the tank. Another feature that I love on the Cuisinart is the \"CLEAN\" warning light, which lets you know when it is time to descale the unit. Having an LED light when dispensing each cup of coffee is another attention to detail that is appreciated. The ability to brew 1-4 cups when you just want a quick cup to go is a great option too. So, needless to say, I highly recommend this 12 Cup Coffee On Demand coffee maker to anyone. You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "This was a Christmas gift for my husband. His last coffee pot only lasted a year, and he was forced to go back to his old school, slow drip pot. So when I saw this one, and made sure secretly that he would enjoy it, I went forward with the purchase. While the power cord may be slightly short, we do have a designated coffee area with a plug so the plug situation doesn't bother him. But the best idea and one feature my husband totally loves, especially with the hour that he wakes up in the morning (2:45 AM), is the light that comes on when he's filling up his coffee mug, most perfect idea. He's like a big kid in a candy store. The water container comes our, the coffee brew basic comes out, and the bucket that holds the coffee comes out, all for easy cleaning. Most important, the coffee stays hot for as long as you need it. Pictures to follow, and a more accurate update after my husband has broken it in after a month.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first review, and unfortunately it is not a good one. The machine appears to be very well built, the stainless trim is nice, although the cover for the drip tray has some very sharp edges, and the water reservoir seems fragile. But overall, it *felt* like a quality product.My first batch of coffee was quite good. I cleaned out the reservoir and filter, and made a second batch. The second batch leaked all over my counter and my floor. The dispenser mechanism was stuck open, and the coffee just poured out into the drip tray and overflowed all over my kitchen. As I was cleaning up the ensuing mess, I saw a warning printed on the bottom of the coffee reservoir, something like \"if the machine leaks coffee, depress this valve while cleaning...\" or something to that effect. In other words, they knew that the valve was a problem, but instead of FIXING THE DESIGN, they put the burden on the user. \"Oh, your machine is leaking coffee all over your counter? You need to clean out the valve in the reservoir.\"Uhhh, no.I could see the valve getting clogged after a lot of use, or maybe if I overflowed the filter and there were coffee grounds in the reservoir. But this was the second time I had used the machine. There were no coffee grounds clogging anything. It just stuck open. Maybe there was a thin film of coffee that made it stick, maybe I did not clean it thoroughly enough, but again, it was the second time the machine had ever been used!I sent the machine back, and Amazon provided a refund, no questions. I do appreciate that.Unless you like drinking your coffee off the counter, dont buy this machine.",
