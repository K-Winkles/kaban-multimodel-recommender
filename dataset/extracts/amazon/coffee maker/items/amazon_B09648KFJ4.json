I have yet to see a mess from this machine and have posted photos showing how good the coffee bed actually looks. In the photo, that is 69g of fresh roasted beans ground right before brewing using a Fellow Ode grinder. Not even close to a mess!Now getting into the actual review. My have to haves for this machine were a timer for auto brewing for the weekdays, SCA approved and a thermal carafe. I have owned other SCA approved machines in the past like the Breville Precision Brewer, the Bonivita 8 cup and the latest was an SCA approved Ninja Machine. If the Ratio 6 had a timer that would have been in the running this time around. Unfortunately it does not and this machine checked all my boxes so I decided to give a it a try and so glad I did!Without touching on all it's options yet, the one thing the machine needed to do in order to make it a keeper was make a great cup of coffee! If it couldn't do that, then it wouldn't matter how high tech this thing was and all the fancy stuff it could do, it was going back. Well I am happy to say, this machine makes one delicious cup of coffee! My first reaction to my first brewed sip was WOW, this cup is smooth! It was super smooth, sweet and delicious! An 8 cup pot finished brewing in just about 5 minutes which is pretty fast.The thermal carafe definitely kept the coffee hot for an hour after brewing and was even drinkable 2 hours later. Some reviews mentioned they were upset there was no hot plate. No thermal carafe machine comes with a hot plate! That is the reason for going with the thermal carafe. So your coffee doesn't cook and continue to change in flavor. If you want a hot plate, you need to buy the glass carafe. That goes for any coffee machine. If you want your coffee to stay the hottest in the thermal carafe, run hot water in the carafe so when you brew your coffee, you won't be brewing into a cold carafe which will cool the coffee down quicker. Also, the more coffee left in the carafe the longer it will stay hotter for. If you only have one cup left in the carafe, it will cool down quicker then if you have say 4 cups sitting in there.The machine allows you to choose the gold standard setting which sets everything to the SCA approved cup of coffee and no settings can be changed when set to this but for those who like to tinker, the machine also allows you to set the exact temperature of the water from 185\u00b0 to 205\u00b0. You can also change the brew strength between 3 settings, light, medium and bold. I am not sure what this setting actually adjusts as it's separate from the temperature setting. I haven't brewed on anything besides the gold setting so far but I am definitely going to test the other stuff out but the Gold Setting brews a great cup.The wifi option is such a bonus on this thing! It makes setting everything up super easy. Being able to set a schedule for weekdays means I don't need to program the machine every night. If something changes, can just go into the app and change what I need. Have grinds and water in the machine but don't want to brew yet, can just start the brew from my phone when I am ready. It's great. Also hooked up to Google Home with no problem. Like I said though, if the machine didn't brew a great cup of coffee none of this other stuff would have mattered!Bottom line, yes the machine is expensive but if you are reading this review around the time it's posted, it's $100 off right now putting it much closer in price and even better then some of it's competitors! And it make a great cup of Joe!*8 Month Update - Machine is still working great! Have not had any issues and still producing a great cup of coffee. I basically have kept it on the Gold setting and found there is really no need to play with the temp and strength as the Gold Cup produces a great cup. I have been using an 18:1 coffee to water ratio based on the ounces listed on the water reservoir. Fresh roasted whole beans and weighed out. During the week I prep the night before and have a schedule setup in the app for weekdays. In the morning the coffee still comes out great even with grinding the night before. I have yet to experience any mess with grinds overflowing as others talk about and have made pots using up to 74 grams of coffe. Still recommend this machine.",

                "reviewText": "Don't hesitate to get this smart coffee pot. It is beautiful, easy to operate and set up. Most importantly it makes a great tasting cup of coffee \u2615\ufe0fI did the usual vinegar water run through of a new coffee pot, then 2 brew cycles with plain water to get the plastic newness out of any first coffee brews. Doing this also helps me familiarize with how the system works. Then I set up wifi (easy) and set it to brew at 8 a.m. on gold setting. I ground the coffee, put water in and woke up to the aroma of coffee brewing. I love that if I wake up earlier than the brew time is set for, I can go into the ap and start coffee from wherever I am.I also have a smart Cafe range I love and microwave so that is what led me to the coffee pot in same series. The copper accents are as quality as what is on my range and microwave. I've seen some reviews saying it's cheaply made but I don't see that on mine at all. It's a heavy sturdy well made copper handle yet light to lift. Accents are all same good quality as on my appliances.The stainless steel pot has a mouth wide enough to get in there and clean too. (The stainless steel I had before had such a small opening that it was very hard to clean.) So I noticed that right away. There are useful settings such as cleaning you can also set from app.The water canister is not removable and the ONLY feature I would change about it is that as others have said, this is such a convenient part of a coffee system missing on this one. I just use my old Ninja system one to fill it. The cups are not the same amount though, about a half cup off.There is also a removable filter in the water resivour but I haven't found out where to buy for replacement yet. I think this is a great part to have for great tasting coffee and filters should be connected to buying the system. I use the filtered water from my refrigerator to fill my coffee resivore and this is extra filtering. Our water here in Washington State is pure but hard!Over all best looking and tasting coffee pot we've ever had. It was a little more than I usually soend on a coffee pot but worth it!I'll update in a few months how it's doing but I'm sure I will feel the same way!Edit 3 months later:I wanted to come back and say, after having this a few months, they should design the water holder with a vent that allows airflow because it stays fogged up and a humid environment like this is can lead to bacteria growth. They should just make it removable to clean but at least a vent!Filters for water were also hard to find but we did find them on Amazon. Otherwise still happy with it.6 month review: June 2023Have had a few problems with the wifi randomly disconnecting my coffee maker so I have to go in and do it all over. Also minor glitches when you cancel a pre set. The App doesn't like you to cancel and you have to unplug and reset.I've gotten zero support from GE about the vent issue in water chamber. I simply leave the lid propped open to dry it out after coffee brews. Despite this effort, I've found mold in the filter area when changing water filter. I now remove that filter daily when drying out water chamber.This coffee pot is a lot of maintenance for such an expense! So far I'm still using it but would not buy again unless GE fixes the water chamber issue. Either removable water chamber or a VENT.",

However you have to prop the water and coffee areas open every day to dry them out, otherwise it\u2019s going to make dank coffee really soon.I had raised my coffee-making ability to an 8/10 using thermal carafes, descaling, using filtered water and really good, fresh beans. This machine takes it to 10/10. Is it worth the hassle to get the upgrade? With a UK plug yes, but for me I wish I hadn\u2019t bothered.",
