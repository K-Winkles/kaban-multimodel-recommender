So into the trash it goes and in with the new single button, cheap as chips, basic as all get out Mr. Coffee and delivered SAME DAY. So coffee in the morning!!!!! Today I made the first pot and it was just like nothing had changed. It's not fancy, but I'm making plain black Italian Dark roast coffee, not mocha chappa latta fromky bobo nada triple whip excess.Now I may not get another 15 years out of this one, but 10 years would be okay.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A very simple automatic drip coffeemaker.",
                "reviewText": "This 12-cup coffeemaker is a very handy, everyday tool to have around in the kitchen. It features a plethora of benefits, along with a few caveats (a.k.a. drawbacks) worth mentioning.Pros:- A very simple, minimal design, featuring a translucent window to gauge how much water is put inside.- Fully plastic and very lightweight. It can make cleaning a simple process. This also means a reduced probability of scaling, as it frequently happens on metal products.- Lightweight decanter, though the container is made of thin glass (or possible that it is made of polycarbonate: not confirmed). It makes it up with a plastic lid and a sturdy plastic handle.- Coffee comes out rather hot\u2014as expected.- Heating surface helps keep the coffee hot.- The coffee that comes out is, indeed, coffee. I'm kidding: I can taste the coffee bean that the drink came out of, and not some utterly burnt mess. (It's able to do its intended purpose very well.)- The price isn't too bad. My expected baseline would be around $25\u2014lucky if it's $20.- Product was well-packaged, with most of the packaging being environmentally responsible (using cardboard instead of styrofoam packaging).- Legible instruction manual.Cons:- The thin decanter may need some care put forth into it when cleaning. Following the care instructions can help expedite the process.- The power cable, upon unboxing, was stuck so far into the device (I couldn't get it out of the cable management/routing hole in the rear) that I had to unscrew ALL screws on the bottom in order to safely remove the cable from the rear. I was in fear of yanking the cable too hard to where it could break something\u2014the rear cable routing hole, OR the cable. *I have the strangest feeling this was a QA oversight and not something intentionally done by design or the manufacturing process.*- The power cable is pretty stiff, which makes routing the cable itself a mere frustration. One would question if it's worth wiggling the power cable in order to loosen the cord itself, at the expense of eventually wearing out the copper wiring inside. This might also explain why it was so difficult to remove the cable from the rear hole.- The coffeemaker tends to drip its liquid contents from the filter whenever you pull the decanter from the device. It's very annoying, but can usually be resolved with a quick wipe of a damp rag/paper towel, followed up by wiping it with a dry towel in order to lessen the chances of staining the heating pad.- There are plenty of single-use plastics within the packaging that might be worth reducing.Suggestions to rectify some of the issues noted:- If this isn't being done, already: Make an effort to use less single-use plastics in regards to packaging the included materials. I'm certain that most of the cardboard is doing well enough of a job in keeping the product safe.- Use power cables that are easily flexible instead of the stiff power cable. It's extremely bothersome to be barely able to move it around in especially confined spaces.- If possible: redesign the filter basket so it doesn't just drip onto the heating pad whenever you pull out the decanter for a quick pour. It can make maintenance quite a chore since the liquid contents dries up rather quickly on the heated surface.Overall: This is a low-cost (at the time of purchase: ~$28) coffeemaker where you aren't the kind of person to use more excessive features (e.g. \"brew later\", an on-screen clock, brewing preferences), and just wants a nice cup of Joe. You simply can't go wrong with this device. Since the price for this product has greatly fluctuated (a.k.a. gone up), I absolutely recommend getting this at a much lower price, as getting it around $40 is simply not worth the expense.",

Another good feature, if you just can't wait for that coffee to stop brewing, you could take your much needed cup of coffee and it will stop brewing and then continue to brew when you put the pot back on. Makes excellent coffee. Would definitely recommend Mr. Coffee. Joyce",

                "reviewText": "If it worked properly the coffee machine wouldn't be that bad. It is bulky, made of cheap plastic, unattractive, but it does the job for the most part. Condensation builds up on the underside of the cover which spills onto the counter every time you open it. There are no features, just an on and off switch, which you'd think is fine for the price but even other coffee makers at the same price have several features.That being said, the first one I got leaked from the bottom. Every time I made coffee there would be a pool of water on the counter. I asked for a replacement, which I got. This one worked for about a month and then the switch started coming loose, and then stopped working entirely. I asked reported the problem and they offered me yet another replacement, to which I was skeptical but accepted. Then after waiting for over a month I wrote back asking for a refund instead of a replacement, which they said they would do. Two more months went by without a refund so I ping them, now they're saying they want me to send in the last defective machine to get a refund.If you're looking for a cheap, straightforward coffee maker, get a different one. For $40 you expect something cheap and simple that will work, not to have to deal with awful customer service for months. Not only that but like I said, in the $40 price range there are better machines out there. I should also mention that the customer service was directly from Mr. Coffee, not Amazon.",
