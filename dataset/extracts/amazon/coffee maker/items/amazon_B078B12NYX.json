The little scooper was an added bonus, with a clamp to ensure it does not get lost. The instructions that come with the box are very easy to follow, and the coffee maker is super easy to clean. I first used this coffee maker while camping and I was very happy with how easy the process was.",

I found that by using a small sturdy frying pan and preheating it on the lowest setting it works really well and does not affect my induction hob. I also found that the best way to use it is to put in hot water in the base and to leave the lid open when using it. Since doing this I have found that it really improves the flavour. The espresso maker is well made and I have had no other issues with it so would definitely recommend it.",
