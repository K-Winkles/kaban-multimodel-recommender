                "reviewText": "This coffee machine arrived pretty quickly with all the holiday shopping going on. The coffee maker was very easy to put together and easy to operate. The water warm up fast and it make coffee In a short time. It's nice to look at and it functions seem pretty basic with built-in clock That is also easy to set. My experience with this coffee maker is pretty consistent with majority of the reviews I read here. I like that it keeps the coffee warm for about 2 hours and then automatically shut off. It came with some filers which I appreciate because I didn't have any right away so they can in handy for my first coffee which was great. No noise and easy to clean up. I did not experience any dripping issues. I recommend this coffee maker and I think it's worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "So, like you all ,I've been a coffeeholic for many years. Like you ,I've struggled to have a decent maker in my kitchen. I recently finished up with my Cuisinart mod#CHW-12. Had it for 5yrs. It got to point of no longer producing a well tasting cup. We did the Vinigar cleaning etc. So, i spent MANY hours searching online for a decent Maker. Problem was the abundance of poor reviews encompassing many manufacturers! It's now 2018 and we have trouble creating a Kit Coffee Brewer thats decent! I did a switch and desired a maker that will produce a single cup as wife n i both have coffee at different times and mostly need the one 16oz cup. In searching for the 12cup Carafe / or single cup Maker ,my choices became limited. Read the reviews and pulled the trigger on this. It's only been 1wk now but i can honestly state that it is the BEST maker I've ever used! I ran a full 12cup Carafe first off, thn dumped. Then did same for the single cup side. ( full 14oz). Then ran 12cups clean water through for both. Then did the Coffee that I'll drink. No issues. Had to play round wth the exact amount of grounds for the single side so to get the outcome i desired. Has clock, easy to pre prog., and, the single side will turn off when done. The Carafe side will stay on (hot plate) for 2hrs after brewing complete. You can simply press On/Off button to turn off anytime. For those who have an over-spilling issue with the grounds within the gold filter basket?, you are using TOO MANY grounds! The single side comes with a gold reusable filter which also encompasses two - Level markers. One is min and the other is Max. If you fill above the Max level, WELL, overflow of grounds will prob. occur. On the Amazon site you'll see the Reusable filter for the Carafe side in \" frequently ordered with\". I also ordered that as i don't like paper filters. It performs well. Water level for Carafe is helpful. It's towards the right rear, on the side. It's accurate. Brew time for 12 cups was good. I've learned to warm up my Mug when using single side as it is not as hot as Carafe as no hot plate for the Mug. I use single side to run water for tea as well. What would make this model perfect? If it sounded out a tone when brewing is complete. It also has No charcoal filter as with my Cuisinart. No biggie as i always have used filtered water to begin with. Coffee is better when there's no Chlorine in the H2O! Filling either the Carafe or single side is easy and Max level markers are visible enough to get it right. Carafe pours very well and i like that the Carafe lid stays attached as u simply press thumb to open but it's not required to pour. Single side grounds chamber pulls out easily. Single side has a bottom (under mug/cup) that reverses to then become a elevator to bring cup higher if you'd like. I brewed a cup at lowest level without any spill or splatter. It drips slow enough that i don't believe i need to elevate my mug. This model also looks fantastic, Beautiful! Has a \"Bold\" brew mode for both Carafe n Sing. The brewing is slower, so u gt a richer brew. Light on clock only on when unit is ON. Has seperate green light that indicates you are using \"Program\" mode. I don't use \"Pods\" but if i did the manual states that \"Senseo\" Pods will work. Note that unit will only brew one side at a time. It cannot brew both sides at once. Very pleased so far. If any issues I'll update here. P.s. if Manufacturer reads this, you may want to consider modifying so to have an end of brew audible tone! Jst a thought. Update!; 1/5/18. Jst did 2 Lg mugs for me ( nine- 8oz cups), using Carafe of course. Wife then needed to do her single 14oz using of course the Single serv side. When throwing the slide switch over to Single, it turns off the Carafe side. So, yeah, hot plate under Carafe is still hot, but, it's now off. So, in future, wife does her single, first, then i do Carafe. UPDATE ; 1/22/18- 3wks now and NO ISSUES! When removing coffee filled Carafe, absolutely no spilling onto hot plate. The spring loaded valve above, performing well. Reviewers having the Hot plate discoloration or burning may be turning unit on with a Hot plate thats dirty. I make sure plate is clean /dry before and after ea. use. I make sure bottom of Carafe is clean/ dry as well. Wife using single serve ea. day and says \" best cup of Coffee ever\"! Update; 4/17/21. NO issues, all still good. UPDATE!!! - 10/10/21- So, finally I'm now considering buying a new one of these as this one is intermittently not pumping enough water up and into Coffee basket. About 12\u00d7 now in past 6mon's I've had to pour out Carafe into another cup, place Carafe back, then pour my Coffee,(that looks like Tea), into the grinds basket and do a Double Drip, sometimes twice to get color I wish. I got roughly 3.5 years out of this Maker. I guess that's good considering Everything's made in Cheapo China. If/when I buy a new one, I'll post back. Have a good Coffee! UPDATE: 11/14/21. So, I purchased this exact model once again on 10/12/21. After 1 month, I can honestly state that it's a great difference between original and new. New machine brews perfectly as did the original one up until the 3yr mark. No issues to report with this New Maker( Same model as first one). Pictures here are of 2nd maker,(2021).",

Makes decent coffee both in the pot and in the cup. Easy to set up. The one downside, and the reason for only 4 stars is that it only keeps coffee hot for 2 hours, which is not nearly long enough. I'll definitely look for one that stays on longer when I need to replace this one.",

The single serve option with the carafe is the main reason I bought this maker and has been a hit in the house. I didn\u2019t expect it to make the coffee so quickly either so that\u2019s definitely a plus. It keeps the drinks at a good temperature even after it finishes making the coffee. Haven\u2019t experienced any leaks. Fingers crossed it continues to perform well. My only criticism is the brew is a bit too weak on the normal setting, so the bold brew is my standard",

It is very convenient not having to use the pot for one cup. It may just be because it is new - but the coffee tastes better than from my previos coffe maker.

                "reviewText": "Bought this after my second Keurig brewer went on the fritz. I wasn't willing to pay another hundred-and-something dollars for a brewer that only brews expensive single cups and only lasts 2-3 years.This seemed in line with what I was after and the reviews were very positive -- not to mention, the price was right -- so I went for it. I've been using it every day for 2 weeks now and I've been very happy with it.It does NOT accept typical single-serve pods as a Keurig or similar brewer would, only \"pads\" which are essentially just individually-packaged grounds wrapped in a filter. This is actually fine, though, since these can be found here and there for about 25 cents each, which is a whole lot cheaper than the Keurig-compatible pods -- although selection is necessarily narrower, so if you're choosy about your coffee that might be a drawback. (Side note: teas are quite easy to find in this form factor and brew very nicely.) But that's where the built-in single-cup mesh filter and carafe side come in. You can use the grounds of your choice to make either single cups or any-size (up to 12 cup) pots -- and you can actually make a *strong* single cup, which is a neat trick that I like very much.It has a functional auto-brew setting and seems easy enough to clean.Very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended.",
