The filter is resusable with is an added plus, making the clean up easy and simple. This coffee maker is very simple and works with the press of one button for on and off. Once the water tank is filled, coffee grounds are poured in, with the click of one button, the coffee maker is ready to do its job. I found that it's quick to dispense and the quality of coffee is good, as good as the beans used. I like that there is a keep warm function on the base of the coffee maker, perfect for families where not everyone is ready for their cup of coffee at the same time. The glass carafe included is very standard, the glass feels durable and of decent quality, however, the plastic lid attached too it isn't the best quality but is easy to remove for cleaning. I am pleased with the simplicity and ease of use of this product, however the plastic components, although working well, feel of a cheaper quality of plastic and I question its durability in the long run. A small coffee scoop is included, very cute in size and great for if you want to keep track of how much coffee is poured into the filter.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 5 cup Drip Coffee Maker in black and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This coffee machine not only looks sleek and stylish in my kitchen, but it also delivers deliciously brewed coffee every time.One of the standout features is the anti-drip function, ensuring mess-free pouring and no wasted coffee. The auto shut off function provides me with peace of mind, as I can leave it unattended without worrying about safety. Additionally, the clear water level window makes it easy to fill the reservoir accurately without any guesswork.Cleaning up is a breeze thanks to the washable permanent filter, eliminating the need for disposable filters and saving money in the long run. The warm plate keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature, allowing me to enjoy multiple cups throughout the morning.Overall, this small coffee maker is a fantastic addition to any coffee lover's kitchen. I highly recommend it for its efficient brewing, user-friendly features, and attractive design.",
