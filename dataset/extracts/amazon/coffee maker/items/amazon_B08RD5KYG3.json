                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this permanent coffee filter for my coffee maker, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the results. It has completely replaced the need for disposable paper filters, which not only saves me money but also reduces waste - a win-win!The filter is incredibly easy to use and fits perfectly in my coffee maker. It\u2019s made of high-quality, durable materials that seem like they will last a long time. I appreciate the fine mesh design, which ensures that no coffee grounds end up in my cup.Cleaning the filter is a breeze; I simply rinse it under running water after each use. No more fussing with paper filters that tear or fold over. Plus, I\u2019ve noticed that my coffee tastes even better with this permanent filter, as it allows the natural oils and flavors of the coffee beans to shine through.I highly recommend this permanent coffee filter to anyone looking for a more eco-friendly and cost-effective way to brew their morning coffee. It\u2019s a small investment that pays off in the long run with great-tasting coffee and a reduced environmental footprint.",

The filters are a tad bit smaller than the original one I have, but it I able to hold the 70grams of ground coffee for a full 40oz pot that I brew.I don't care for the flimsy basket handle, so I just removed it. Other than that, the filters seem to work just fine. One less thing that has to go into the bin (paper filters), sure I could recycle and put them in the garden beds, but we drink way too much coffee \u2615\ufe0f \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude1c!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my Ninja Coffee Bar coffee maker as it had a fairly good rating (>4 stars). I really don't know why this has a rating higher than 3 stars. It is usable - so three stars, but you have to push (force) it down into place. I'm giving this 2 stars are the description says specifically that it's a replacement for the Ninja Coffee Bar coffee maker, but it doesn't really fit that well.If you're looking for a basket from a Ninja Coffee Bar coffee maker, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you're looking for a #4 coffee filter basket for a different coffee maker, this might work well.UPDATE: After having used the filter for a few days, it seems to fit better and will just drop into place (without needing to be pushed). Upgraded my rating to 3 stars. In my opinion it's not as good as the original filter that came with the Ninja, but is satisfactory. It does appear to be slightly shorter (maybe an 1/8th of an inch) as I usually brew the travel mug size this isn't an issue for me. Not sure if it's an issue when brewing a full pot.",
