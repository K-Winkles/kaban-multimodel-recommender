                "reviewText": "The Amaste Drip Coffee Machine in matcha green is a chic and stylish addition to any kitchen, boasting a retro design that catches the eye. This coffee maker comes with a 25 oz glass pot, a reusable coffee filter, and offers three brewing modes, making it a versatile choice for coffee enthusiasts.The visual appeal of the machine is a significant highlight. Its matcha green color and retro style add a touch of elegance to your kitchen countertop. The 25 oz glass pot is a perfect size for personal use, allowing you to brew just the right amount of coffee.However, there are some downsides to consider. The material used in the construction of the coffee maker may not be as durable as one would hope, potentially raising concerns about long-term use. Additionally, some users might find the machine a bit on the small side, making it less suitable for larger gatherings.One of the standout features of this coffee maker is the three brewing modes, which allow you to adjust the coffee's intensity to your liking. However, the downside is that the bottom part of the pot does not heat the coffee, so it doesn't stay warm for extended periods. You'll need to consume your coffee relatively quickly after brewing to enjoy it at the ideal temperature.In summary, the Amaste Drip Coffee Machine is a stylish choice for coffee lovers, offering customization and a compact size. While its chic design and versatility are appealing, the concerns about material durability, size, and the lack of prolonged heat retention may influence your decision. If you prioritize aesthetics and versatility over durability and keeping your coffee warm, this coffee maker could be a good fit for your needs.",

And a couple of renters had said the coffee pot did not work. Maintenance pulled it out. Replaced it with another one. I was over there recently and brought this one back home with me. I plugged it in, filled it with water and turned it on, nothing happened. Then I also pushed the button on the drip strength and, it worked. I ran it about 20 times to make sure it did work. It worked just like it\u2019s supposed to! It\u2019s so stinking cute I was very happy, I took it back over there and switched out the coffee pots! So, revising my review!! I added instructions to push both buttons on the inside of the cabinet door, where the coffee lives!",

I have been using it every day for a week now, and the coffee it makes is superb. I can use less coffee because the flavor on the boldest setting is so robust. I love the way it looks in my kitchen, and more importantly, it makes great coffee! I am very pleased with my purchase.",

Beside that they were sold out of the Drew Barrymore black and gold one! I have only had it for 3 months or so and am going to throw it away or give it to my daughter if she wont mind cleaning coffee off her floor and cabinets every day! I dont know what it is but every time I pour the coffee it drips all over the place! I am sick of cleaning it not to mention my daughter moved in and its not big enough for all 3 of us now! It wasnt big enough for just my husband and I and always had to brew 2 times a day (because I am a cold brew freak) but now its up to 3 times a day! Besides that I drink cold brew and wait for it to cool down but since I am brewing so much now it melts all my ice! LOL I am getting the Drew Barrymore NOW!",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Amaste coffee maker. I changed only due to colour preference after some renovations. I first had the butterscotch (called champagne) coloured Amaste coffee maker. This one is very beautiful in white (NOT ivory), with rose gold accents. It really is a rose gold hue, not regular gold colour. As with the first one I purchased (which works just fine and is packed away), it makes excellent tasting coffee. There are 3 level choices of brew. It is not a big coffee maker, but nice for 2 large mugs or 3 smaller cups, per pot. There is a glowing blue while it's brewing. The shut off works perfectly, for safety, about 15 mins after it's finished brewing. No paper filters needed, which is nice. Very happy with my purchase x 2 ! Would recommend 100% ps. to preserve the quality and to ensure it runs smoothly, clean it often. And dry it well each day, the pot and the inner lid/filter cups.",
