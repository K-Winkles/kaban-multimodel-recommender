It is large capacity, so I can brew just a few cups or up to 12 large cups. Has an automatic turn off, so no need to worry about burnt coffee or burned down house. Takes up very little counter space. The electric cord could be a bit longer, but works fine for me. It brews deliciously tasting coffee in no time at all. No fuss no muss. Nothing fancy, just good coffee maker. Good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This 12-cup coffee maker is seriously one of the best I've ever bought, and that includes some of the better-known name brands. The 2-hour auto shut-off is really convenient, as well as the awesome feature of just \"toggling\" the on/off switch to quickly re-heat what's left in the pot! Well-made and extremely reasonable. I'd recommend to anyone and would purchase again.",

It\u2019s easy to use and the timer for the two hours does work. There\u2019s only one button you turn it on and it does turn off in two hours,One thing I wasn\u2019t liking too much was you have to pour the coffee or water slowly out of the pot because it will drip but other than that it\u2019s a great little coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this coffee maker after my previous one finally broke. I was specifically looking for a few key features which this coffee maker had. I wanted a coffee maker that had a mechanical On/Off switch, and I wanted a coffee maker that did NOT automatically shut off after a period of time. The reason I wanted these features is because I am slowly but surely turning my home into a \u201csmart home\u201d and I have been wanting to automate as many things as I can. Surprisingly at the time I was looking at this coffee maker I don\u2019t believe there was a coffee maker with native Apple HomeKit compatibility. To my knowledge as of October, 2023 there still isn\u2019t. That wasn\u2019t a big deal, because I have a smart outlet that I plugged the coffee maker into. Now I can have the coffee maker turn on and start brewing coffee at whatever time I set up the automation for, so that when I finally get out of bed the coffee is already brewing. Yes, I could have done that with an automatic coffee maker that has a built-in timer, but this is great because I can program the outlet to turn on/off at various times or set up stipulations that someone has to be home in order for it work (preventing the coffee maker from doing its thing when we are away from home and forgot to turn off the auto feature on other coffee pots that we have had.)I also really appreciate the fact that it doesn\u2019t auto shutoff after 2 or 4 hours. I know that is meant to be a safety feature, but with my smart home it is an unnecessary feature. I have an automation set up that when the last person leaves home it shuts the outlet off. Normally I don\u2019t assume that the automation will work, but in case I forget it will take care of it for me.Another feature, and I am not sure if this was a deliberate feature or not, but I have noticed that when it is brewing, occasionally it will pause brewing for a short time (maybe 30-45 seconds??) and that is good, because it allows me to pick up the coffee pot when it is still brewing and pour myself a cup if I am too impatient to wait for it to finish. It DOES have \u201cpause and pour\u201d meaning that there is a check valve that shuts off the flow to the carafe so that the coffee doesn\u2019t just continue to keep pouring out on to the burner, but with this pause there is typically ZERO drips. May sound like a little thing (and truthfully it is), but that little drip gets on to the burner and the water quickly evaporates leaving coffee residue which I would have to clean up later. If I wait until the brewing temporarily pauses on its own then I prevent even a single drip. Like I said it is a small thing, but it is just one more small little thing that makes me really like this coffee pot even more.It is so ironic in a day and age when things are getting more technical and more sophisticated that I would willingly choose a coffee pot that is as simple as it can possibly get. I have had coffee makers that were far more sophisticated, but in the end I want to be able to control the coffee maker via my smart home and not have the coffee maker control itself.Lastly, I wanted to mention that the coffee pot is very reasonably priced at just under $30. The fact that I got a good quality coffee maker that is exactly what I was looking for and it also was among the lowest price that Amazon had to offer is a win-win for me! I have zero regrets buying this coffee maker. Actually, that\u2019s not true \u2014 I wish I would have bought it sooner! If you\u2019re on the fence, go ahead and get it \u2014 it\u2019s a beautifully simple coffee pot which is exactly what I was looking for!",
