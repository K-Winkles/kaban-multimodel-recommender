Equipped with our new MultiStream brewing technology which uses multiple streams of water to saturate the grounds more evenly throughout the pod. How does MultiStream brewing technology work? This technology features 5 entrance needles instead of 1 to saturate the grounds more evenly throughout the pod and extract more of the rich flavor and aroma you love. This technology will be used by default on every brew and cannot be turned off. What types of pods are compatible with the Keurig K-Supreme Single Serve coffee maker? The K-Supreme coffee maker brews Keurig K-Cup pods. It does not brew K-Carafe pods, K-Mug pods, Vue pods, or Rivo pods. Can K-Cup pods be reused? For best results, we recommend one time use with our K-Cup pods. Reusing or rotating the K-Cup pod after brewing can cause overflow and coffee grounds. Can I use the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter with the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Single Serve coffee maker? Yes, the K-Supreme coffee maker is compatible with the Keurig My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter -be sure to purchase the most recent model with the grey top, compatible with MultiStream brewing technology",

                "reviewText": "My daughter has one of these and I loved it. But I couldn\u2019t justify getting one when my other one was working fine. But the old one stopped working about a month later! Yay! This one takes up less space on my counter. It works instantly. Love that it has its own filter. I liked that it has a 12 oz. option, but personally I find the coffee is a little too watered down for my taste. The 10 oz is really good maybe due to the fact that this one punctures the cup with more holes.",

                "reviewText": "Never been a coffee drinker, but I've tried many times over the years, getting various coffee makers including the prestigious Mocha Master. Just never clicked for me though. I'd buy a coffee maker, try it out, and then give it away. Instant ones with pods, ones that use grounds. Didn't matter.But I'm getting tired of seeing health benefits of drinking a moderate amount of coffee, so figured since I don't DISLIKE it, I may as well go for it. And I still had the last thing I tried, a Nutri Bullet pod one, and just didn't like it. Figured if I'm going to get serious, get something a bit more serious.This one came up with good reviews and the name brand was recommended to me by a product designer friend in Boston who actually has worked with this company in the past. So I took the chance.Night and day compared to my other coffee attempts. The unit is well built and designed, simple to use, doesn't feel cheap. The flip up cover for the pod compartment locks solid, never hangs up and doesn't rattle at all, it's snug. Button presses work every single time. Never had to hit something a second time.Initially I wanted the water in the back to make it more streamlined, but I find I prefer it on the side for the ease of refilling.I haven't bothered with the filter yet since we have really good water where I live.I like the option for the stronger brew, and the various sizes. I always just do the biggest size and strong brew. And I like that even doing a slower strong brew, it still finishes faster than the others I had when doing normal.I also appreciate that it STOPS DRIPPING when it finishes brewing. Some I'd have would drip randomly for a few minutes after I removed the cup.I've only tried a few different brand pods in here, and all work well. I like that this has the multiple water feed since I see they're changing some things up so at least I'll be more compatible moving forward with newer pods.For the price, this was a gamechanger for me. I'm now drinking coffee each day - at least most of them, since it's still a new thing for me so not part of my auto pilot routine...",

Easy to use, no grounds in the coffee, great taste.This unit has it all, and tastes like good coffee.I bought it because we had purchased the SMART version, only to discover it was none of the above, and definitely not smart, unless you believe every appliance deserves a medal.So save some money, and buy this Keurig, if you want a sensible, and very functional coffee maker.I am using the SMART unit to make hot water: it rarely screws that up.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Big improvement to the Keurig series",
                "reviewText": "RECOMMENDATION:Big Thumbs up \u2013 you actually get more out of each coffee pod with this new coffee makerTHE GOOD:1. Keurig replaced the water boiler in older units with a new heat-on-demand system that only heats water as it is brewing the coffee. This solves one of the biggest problems with the old units \u2013 they had to keep water hot all the time so they bled heat/energy and thus were expensive to operate. That completely goes away with this new design.2. There is a new injector system that punctures the top of the pod and injects the hot water into the coffee grounds in the pod. The number of injectors increases from 1 to 5. The net effect is that the water is better distributed throughout the grounds and thus you get more coffee out of each pod. The coffee that I brew through this new unit using the 8oz and \u2018Strong\u2019 setting (see below) is the same strength as what I used to get on my older units on the 6oz setting.3. The water reservoir can be positioned to the side or rear of the unit, which is good for fitting into narrower spaces.4. There is a \u2018Strong\u2019 setting what slows down the brewing process to get more flavor out of the pods. I love this as it gets more coffee out of each pod.5. There is also an \u2018iced\u2019 setting for making iced coffee by actually brewing over ice, but have not tested that setting.THE BAD:1. The first couple seconds when the brewing starts, the coffee stream coming out of the maker is mostly just regular water and not coffee yet. That is because it takes the heat-on-demand system a few seconds to get hot enough to start actually start brewing coffee. That means that you can\u2019t yank the coffee cup out from the unit after the first half of the brew cycle to get just the strongest coffee and thus the Keurig equivalent of an expresso.",
