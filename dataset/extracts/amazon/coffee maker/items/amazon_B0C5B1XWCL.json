I've had Keurigs, I've had Bunns, but this makes the best tasting coffee from a pod that I've ever had. Using a standard k pod on the bold setting makes a perfect tasting 12oz. cup of coffee with great flavor that can totally stand up to the half and half and Splenda that I add. It has turned my son from a casual coffee sipper to a full fledged dedicated drinker now.It makes great pots of coffee too. I'll never buy a different coffee maker again.",

It also has an attachment to where if you like to make hot tea it comes with its own tea strainer. The pot is wonderful if you have many guests and want to save on the pods. The water container in the back is perfect. Easy to get to no fuss in replacing the water. My girlfriend gave me a Britta as a gift, so I fill it with water and it has its strainer so my machine gets low on water. I popped the top off pour it and Walla.. It\u2019s actually double strained because it does come with an another filter. , so I fill it with water and it has its filter so when the machine gets low on water. I popped the top off pour it and Walla. When other little tip that I absolutely love is that you do not have to wait for the water tank to warm up. The minute you push that button it automatically starts. Last but not least in opening up the top to put your pod in keep in mind that when you close it, you need to press just a little Pressure to wait for it to snap. because it\u2019s new. It will take some time for it just to gently snap on its own but I love it. Enjoy your coffee!",

Easy to set up timer to make a pot next morning, and can make individual cups with either pods or ground coffee in either regular or bold strengths, Very easy to clean as stores no water so no Build up. The keep warm plate works well for a couple of hours to keep coffee hot.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new coffee pot for the work office. Small office with five employees, but we all drink two to three cups a day. We also had a K-Cup machine for those afternoon cups. I was able to throw away my normal coffee maker and the K-Cup machine which was great.Setup is easy, but changing the time and programming was slightly confusing, but once you figure it out, super easy. Just wait a second for the hour to stop blinking and it moves to the minutes. Same for programming the auto brew for the morning.Coffee tastes great, and the warmer keeps the coffee really hot. Much hotter than a Mr. Coffee brand maker that we got rid of. My one and only complaint is the brew time. The 12-cup maker part makes coffee as excepted, but slower than the Mr. Coffee to brew the same 12 cups. The K-Cup part is the disappointment. The brewing part can house a standard mug or a travel mug. What the instructions don't tell you is no matter how much water you put in the tank for the K-Cup, that is what is coming out. My first cup overflowed and made a mess. As you can imagine, I filled the tank up to full and pressed brew, and then waited, and I mean waited. It takes a solid three to four minutes to start brewing the K-Cup side. Normal K-Cup brewers brew in seconds to a minute at most. Even to heat the water up. However, this coffee maker takes forever. I was able to go to the bathroom, wash a few mugs, and straighten up the kitchen all before the thing made a noise that it was heating up the water. I am really perplexed that the K-Cup part takes so long to brew and that is supposed to be the faster and more convenient option. Baffles me.",

I also wanted to brew one cup at a time without filling the landfill with plastic Keurig K-cups (no, they don't recycle them, even though they say they do), so I loved the idea of the one-cup brew basket that comes with the unit. Problem is, it produces a \"needle\" warning on every use, even though I only fill the basket to the level indicated. Brewing one cup of coffee takes multiple attempts, 100% of the time. And, the coffee it produces is weak, despite being on the \"Bold\" setting. Also, filling the one-cup reservoir is a gigantic mess producing pain in the butt if you keep your coffee pot under an upper kitchen cabinet. You have to reach behind the unit to fill it, guaranteeing spillage. And, it only holds one-cup of water! Why not multiple cups of water and dispense only one cup at a time like every other K-cup brewer??? Can't recommend this product to anyone!",

We instead use the little basket for one cup so we can use our own coffee. We like that we can choose the size of cup. It actually has a delay brew that works. We also like that you can choose a regular or bold brew. Best of all, you can buy extra brew baskets if you need to from the company (not where you purchased it), and you can actually contact if you need help. I wish the warranty was longer, but if you clean it regularly or have soft water, it hopefully will last longer than a year.",

                "reviewText": "I have only owned this coffee maker for 3-4 months now but I love this machine!! It comes with a reusable metal filter for both the carafe and the single cup makers. It makes fantastic flavor and is the exact some tasting no matter which way you make it, a pot, a single cup or if you use a K-cup. I will say you do have to fine-tune your measurements for the ground coffee but the overall operation of the machine is super easy with no more than a 3 button to a single button operation.The machine is fully programmable so you can wake up to that great morning coffee smell. You can even have it set to fill your traveler's mug so you can avoid those crazy morning drive-thrus at Tims. I have yet to get a blockage on it but I am anal when it comes to cleaning my equipment. I also bought a 3-drawer, 36 k-cup holder from Amazon that sits directly below the machine and looks like the two were meant for one another. It keeps the k-cups out of sight and gives the overall appearance a little more professional look.I have found only 2 cons with this machine as nothing is ever perfect.First, the screen for the clock and programming, although really bright and clear, it shines through a tinted plastic that makes it almost disappear completely if you do not look directly at the right angle. So there are times I can't see the clock or it's hard to make out the display when I sit at my kitchen table.Secondly, my machine has gotten louder in the first 2-3 weeks when it was heating, brewing and finishing the cycle, the noise just got louder and louder. It's not so loud it's annoying or that it may obstruct your morning conversation with the kids or your spouse but it did get significantly louder and so I have to mention that. It was dead quiet when I first started using it, you could barely hear it but now you almost feel like your in a bistro now lol.That aside, this is an astounding coffee percolator. I love the carafe or single cup or even k-cup options. I love the automatic shutoff of the coffee warming plate for the carafe. It shuts off after 2 hours have passed after brewing. I love the 2 separate water level viewing glasses as they are super clear. The disassembly and cleaning of the machine are so easy you could get your four years old to do it, heck even gets the husband to do it. I love the fact you get reusable brewing screens. Being able to program my morning brew that's another pro and above all else, for the price that you will pay for this machine and the flavor and speed you get out of it is simply amazing. Hamilton Beach truly made the definition of value with this machine. I also got the extended 3year warranty on top of the manufacturer 1 year warranty just in case this too good to be true machine doesn't stand the test of time but at this rate I have nothing but positive thoughts that this machine will be here with me for at least another 5 years as long as no one steals it!!",
