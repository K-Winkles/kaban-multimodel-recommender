Recently, the \u201ccompetition\u201d one cup makers are expensive and are awful. They break within a year. Coffee is NOT hot. Leak everywhere. Coffee grinds in each cup made.My friend kept saying how much she LOVES her Hamilton Beach Flexbrew. So I bought it on cyber Monday. I\u2019d had it with my POS Keurig. This coffee maker is AMAZING. It\u2019s hot. The single cup brewing system is amazing. Pot of coffee is great also. I don\u2019t use k-cups and the pod this one comes with is great. Not messy and simple. \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f HIGHLY RECOMMEND",

                "reviewText": "I searched high and low for a dual coffee maker that we would like and would be functional. There is always a lot of coffee happening in our house, especially over the holidays. We always had a higher end brand, so I bought that one first, and it was a disaster. The single cup maker sprayed all over the place, no matter what I did. Then, remembering our trusty Mr. Coffee from the old days, I bought this one. It's the bomb. Not a single issue. Fits both Keurig pods and our grocery store's brand without being finicky. Coffee is consistent. It's super easy to use.I do wish I could adjust the warming temperature. And it's weird that you can't use the single use while the carafe is pre-set for the next morning - so you'd better remember to click that back on after! But this no-frills coffee maker is definitely the one. But those are minor \"complaints.\" I just wish I had bought this one first!",

                "reviewText": "My partner and I both drink coffee. He drinks less than I do but he enjoys flavored (gross) coffee while I can\u2019t stand most of it (because it\u2019s awful). Further, I hate how the flavors tend to linger in fresh batches after previously brewing adulterated coffees. This machine seems to be the ideal solution for us. It\u2019s got a full size carafe for non-revolting coffee while he can use the pods for an occasional \u201cflavored\u201d \u201ccoffee\u201d. I\u2019ve never bought a pod machine before so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s standard for them to come with their own DIY pod, but this one does and I love that since I\u2019m pretty sure the pods aren\u2019t recyclable and because IMO pod coffee never tastes as good as when freshly ground.I have one critique and that is that when the machine loses power for any length of time, the clock will reset. I feel like, in 2024, that really should no longer be an issue but otherwise I appreciate the minimal yet complete feature set. I also wish it had come with a plastic and/or metal coffee filter, but that\u2019s a small quibble.Some reviews here indicate that the coffee from the pod side isn\u2019t hot enough. I prefer to be able to drink my coffee without scalding my tongue or without having to wait. For me, this is a feature and not a bug, but I can see that some might not prefer it this way.We\u2019re on day two but I\u2019m really happy with this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I own a Keurig Duo Essentials. Love it! But it doesn't have all the individual cup size options as my Keurig 2.0 had. That was an adjustment.After reading the specs of the Hamilton Beach Flex Brew, I found it has everything I was looking for in one machine. Brews up to a 14 oz single cup.I really like the individual water reservoirs for being single cups and the carafe brewing.Not only does it come with its own basket for single cups, it has an adapter for k-cups and it accepts the reusable k-cups that you put your own coffee grounds into.The downside I've seen so far: it functions very poorly with hot cocoa k-cups. I resorted to emptying the cocoa k-cups into a cup and using the machine for hot water.Functions poorly when brewing CrioBru cacao in a gold mesh brewing basket.However, all in all, it's a great machine so far.",

The temperature is just right, it is fast, it has a strength control, multiple size control and can accommodate any cup size. It can use pods, refill cups and has a quick easy to remove assembly to change from pod to filter basket in a flash. I have K-cup reuse pods that fit it perfectly so can continue using those too. All the parts disassemble easy to clean out the piercing needles and baskets with ease. The water chamber on single serve holds over a litre of water and is easy clean and fill. The other side can brew up to 12 cups if in need of a lot of coffee at one time. Pot side has a timer to set if you want it to brew and be ready for you n the morning. Only thing I wish they had added, was a reuse filter basket for the pot side, I would pay that extra, but they are easy to find to buy. This is a well thought out brew station, it comes with easy to understand instructions and took just minutes to. Set up. I have used tea, coffee grounds, pods, and every size cup to test it, each fills perfectly to size you set on single serve, even my tall travel mug fits. I simply love this machine, amazing options for the price. I think anyone that tries it will love it too.",
