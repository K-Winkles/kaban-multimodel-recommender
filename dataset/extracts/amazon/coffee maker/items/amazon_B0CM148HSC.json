I used it primarily to do the 4-ounce specialty brew since I like expresso or a \"cortadito\" type of coffee. Because the ninja coffee maker uses only a center water aperture - it distributes the water evenly into the pod. On the bottom of the housing assembly, it does not require the pod to be punctured on the bottom side - thus it works good with the Ninja coffee maker.",
