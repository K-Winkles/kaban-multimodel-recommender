                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Basic but good machine. UPDATED",
                "reviewText": "My wife and I had been looking for a multi-purpose machine, one which makes both a carafe and a pod of coffee. I had seen this and after some investigation, we bought it.Observations:This is a basic machine which does not have a lot of features.I've read a number of reviews complaining the carafe spout design allows a few drops of beverage to spot the countertop. All one has to do is slow down when pouring. The wide spout is conducive to pouring quickly. Me, myself, I pour my coffee over the sink so any drips or drops go in it. Alternatively, a dish towel could be placed on the counter and poured over it.Keurig uses a 5 ounce cup measure for the carafe side. The carafe is 12 cups. 12x5=60, which is the exact reservoir size.READ the directions! This machine is easy to use and does exactly what it says it will do. To expect it to do X when it isn't designed to do, it is unreasonable to expect that performance. If you need a different set of features, find the brewer which has them. Don't buy it and then gripe it doesn't do something it was never designed or equipped to do.Pros:The machine does exactly what it says it will do, day in and day out.It has a 2 hour auto shut-off for the carafe side and a 2-3 minute shut off on the pod size.Easy and intuitive to use.It is simple to maintain. I descale it as needed with the Keurig solution. I descale about every 3 months. Depending on your water, you may have to descale more often, or less depending on your use.You can brew a carafe and use the pod side while the warming plate of the carafe is on. Haven't tried to brew both sides at once.It can be programmed to auto-brew at any given time, however, you must set the auto-brew function each brew cycle. This prevents the machine from automatically brewing a pre-programmed setting when the reservoir is nearly empty or empty. This is simply a safety measure.Cons:The directions which came with my machine says none of the parts are dishwasher safe. I would think for the money, a simple change of plastics composition would be in order without raising the price.The carafe glass stains easily, though it is easy to clean. The glass feels flimsy but I haven't dropped it.It doesn't come with the gold mesh filter, though it can be ordered or purchased at the grocery store.UPDATE:I've regularly descaled the machine with vinegar. Today however, I could not get the descale cycle completed, that is, without some frustration. I'd run out of vinegar and had (fortunately) 2 bottles of the Keurig descaler solution. I used the first bottle and was shocked at the amount of scale it removed. After completing the Duo instructions for descaling, I encountered 2 problems. First, the descale warning light would not go away. The second and most frustrating, is that in the carafe rinse, I would not get the full amount of required water to dispense. Instead of 12 cups, it gave me 8. I thought it was my mistake and I refilled the reservoir and tried it again, making sure I selected the 12 cup carafe amount. This time I got 2 and in the last attempt I got perhaps a few ounces. The pump made a whining, thudding noise.Spending a few minutes on Google told me the issue with no water was either the pump was out or debris in the line. I ran the second bottle of Keurig descale solution and let it sit for about 30 minutes. I then repeated the rinse instructions and this time I got the full amount of dispensed water.The descale lights did not turn off as expected. I learned there is a manual reset sequence which solves it. With the power \"ON\" press and hold the 8 cup and 10 cup selection buttons for about 5 seconds. Mine turned off immediately.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace another brand duo coffee maker that stopped keeping the coffee warm on the warming plate. This makes good coffee and works as it should on the single cup and on the full pot sides. The first thing that I noticed when unpacking it was the extremely cheap feeling plastic that it is made of. Other Keurigs and all other brands that I have used are made from thick, substantial feeling plastic. This seems very thin and very brittle. Why would Keurig not make it from the same material? The biggest problem is, like others have said, you cannot pour from a full pot without it leaking and wasting coffee.UPDATE 01/20/2024My husband called Keurig and complained about the pot leaking coffee while pouring. They sent us a new pot, looks the same, but it does not leak. It was free and arrived in a couple of days.",

                "reviewText": "This unit functions properly. Coffee is hot, all the features work as designed. My biggest problem with it is the mess it leaves when pouring a cup. We make an 8 cup pot. Pouring that first cup, and NOT have coffee running down the pot and dripping onto the floor is almost impossible. Yes, I read the other reviews before I bought it stating similar problems. But I thought if I poured it slowly, to keep the level from going over the lip, then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. WRONG! It\u2019s a total design flaw. Which is pretty amazing when you think about how many good coffee carafes that are out there that DO NOT have this problem. Did Keurig R&D never make a big pot and try to pour it? I may take a Dremel to the lip of the carafe. If that works, I\u2019ll gladly share my work so that Keurig can redesign for their next model\u2026.",
