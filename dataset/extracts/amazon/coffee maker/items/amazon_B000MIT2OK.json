                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This unit will make the best coffee ever. Period.",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Here's an interesting tip. The 26 ounce cans of pre-ground \"house brand\" coffee such as Great Value or Shure Fine have plastic snap-top lids that fit that fit the top of this plastic cone perfectly! Use one to keep the heat in while dripping, or set up the night before and cover the cone securely. Even the colors almost match!PLEASE NOTE: Many of the reviews here, especially 1 star are NOT FOR THIS UNIT! They are for some ceramic pot and appear here in error!This review is for the glass pot and is a unit I purchased, not \"free for review.\"Bottom line for the impatient or over-caffeinated: This unit will make the best coffee ever. Period.Rest of the story: Years ago, Melitta ran ads showing their automatic drip maker and this pot with the phrase, \"Automatic or Manual.\" This was a take-off on the automatic and manual transmission of cars and their comparative benefits.Automatics are convenient, keep the coffee hot and some have clock-timers. But, as \"hipsters\" can attest, pour-over makers offer more control of the brewing process. For example, the ability to pour some water over the grounds, let it \"bloom\" and extract and then pour in the remaining water prevents ground from floating to the top of the cone, essentially unused.And, in my experience, if you put the kettle on and then grind, measure and fill the cone while the water heats (not before!), the whole brewing process is shorter than an automatic drip cycle! I used a stainless steel insulated carafe to hold coffee after brewing as opposed to compatible hot plates.If you've read this far, here is another very important part: This is an (up to) 10 cup maker and uses the original #6 filters, not the far smaller #4. This is critical.#6 filters give you room to \"work\" the grounds as described above. The ability to saturate the grounds with small amount of water to extract the coffee and then add the remaining water is much, MUCH easier with a large cone. #6 cones are available online and in better-stocked stores. You do not have to make 10 cups of coffee to use #6 cones. When I make just one mug, I use a common #4 in the #6 cone.Early automatic makers used #6 cones but later switched to #4 to make smaller units. They also had to come up with various \"sprinkler heads' to saturate the grounds. Some even tried to pulse the water to fully extract the coffee from the grounds. Some models work OK, some don't. And some change over time as minerals in the water clog the piping and pump and alter the dynamics of the whole system. This unit and a kettle (electric or stovetop) keeps things simple.This is not my first unit. I've had them on and off for years, tried pump units, went back to pour-over, etc. But in the long run, this is the most effective, least expensive and just plain good way to make great coffee. I'm sure you can find a $100 \"Super Barista\" pour-over with some elegant design execution and that is fine if you want it. But the basic physics of using a #6 cone are the same.",

                "reviewText": "I've brewed a few cups of coffee with the Melitta now and it is amazing...best coffee I've ever home-brewed! I always used a french press, but recently my wife and I grew tired of the \"dirty\" flavor and decided to finally get a pour-over system since we love the clean taste it produces when we purchase coffee at our local coffee shop. The Melitta is very inexpensive and the design allows for a forgiving pour. The low price anf the many high reviews is what sold me on choosing this pour-over coffee maker, and it is better than expected.My brewing process:I use a quality coffee that's locally roasted, which is probably the only item I splurge on but is also the most important component. I use a burr grinder and set it between medium and fine (slightly closer to medium). I boil water in a cheap kettle (those narrow spout kettles are expensive and are what deterred me away from other pour-over systems that rely heavily on pour technique). I dampen the filter paper with some boiled water and then add the pre-weighed grounds that I roughly weighed on my meat scale to the ratio of 1g:16mL. I use a measuring cup to pour the hot water over the grounds in increments after the initial pour that causes the grounds to bloom. Once it's finished I grab my favorite mug and enjoy an amazing cup of coffee! The whole process is only a few minutes after the water boils.This is truly the best coffee maker at such a great price! It produces coffee so delicious, you'll store your french press in the garbage!",

I use the melitta no 6 natural brown filters with it (found them for $2.50 for a package of 40!). Coffee comes out great. I already have a Nespresso but now that both me and hubby work from home, it is more economical to make a pot of coffee in the morning and use the Nespresso for single serving. I thought about getting a gooseneck kettle and Chemex set up but I wanted to try and easy fuss free pour over first and am glad I did! It's so easy and fast to use and clean and makes great tasting coffee. If I have any leftover coffee I pour it into an insulated mug/thermos to keep it hot.",
