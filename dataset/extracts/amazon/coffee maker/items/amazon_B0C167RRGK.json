There are 3 main factors that affect the taste of coffee, one is the bean, the other is the thickness of the coffee powder, and the other is the amount of coffee powder. It brews slower and takes more time to finish brewing. what is the problem? Does descaling need to be done? Yes. The cause of your?problem may be that there is a build-up of limescale inside the boiler or heating tube, which will result in a slower flow of water, which ultimately results in a longer brewing time. Why is my coffee overflowing from the filter? There are several reasons: 1.Adding too much ground coffee to the filter. 2. Use filter paper and permanent filter at the same time. 3. Misplacement of carafe. 4.Carafe is taken away for more than 30s during the brewing process. I Just received the Gevi coffee maker and it feels too small Hi, thanks for your question about our machine. Gevi 4 Cups Small Coffee Maker is positioned as small and exquisite, which is characterized by small size but large capacity, saving space for you. There is water coming out of the back of the 4 cup coffee maker There is an overflow hole on the back of the machine, when you add water to the water tank beyond the MAX line, the water will flow out of the overflow hole. So please be careful not to exceed the MAX line when adding water.",

                "reviewText": "I was literally just buying an inexpensive coffeemaker to have something on hand for a houseguest - but - this thing is just great.I fell in love when I read the section in the manual \"The quest for perfect coffee\" -- yes, this is a very standard drip coffeemaker, it doesn't have any special features, it doesn't have any gimmicks -- but -- people who really love coffee were heavily involved in the development here, and it shows. It actually makes a reallly really good cup of coffee. I'm super impressed especially for the price.Easy to use, easy to clean, permanent filter is great, and it has a warming plate and brew-pause which are the only two features that matter for a drip-carafe coffeemaker IMO.",

                "reviewText": "I Like it!!!I\u2019ve used a small 4-Cup coffee maker for years.When shopping for a new maker I desired specific features, and the Gevi 4-Cup met all-of-my specs:- Small Footprint.- Glass Carafe.- Auto Off (in 2 hours).OTHER PROS- Even smaller footprint than my previous maker.- I\u2019m actually liking the washable filter. But it can still use a #2 cone if desired.- Coffee and warmer is much hotter than my previous makers so my cup of coffee stays warmer longer.- Best price to features maker that I found.CON- The glass Carafe is tapered making it hard to clean by hand/sponge. But it can still be cleaned easily with a brush such as an: OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush.OTHER NOTES:- The Carafe looks smaller than the previous maker\u2019s with straight sides, but it is the same volume.- The washable filter is nylon and not metal.WASHABLE FILTER NOTE- Don\u2019t use too finely ground coffee. It will leave a little silky-looking dregs in the bottom of the pot.- A normal brew grind like you get with generic coffee like Folgers is best.- The filter cleans easier if you let it dry a bit overnight..... BUT - After using it a while, I have gone back to using #2 Cone Filters.GRINDS DISPOSAL- Dump grinds in trash (not down sink), wash filter in sink.- Grinds can bind with fats in the drainage system creating clogs over time.- Grinds are also good to put in plants and at tree roots, but first look-up the plant to see it it likes acidic soil and will be good for it, ...and don't over do it.KEEPING IT CLEAN & CLEANING- Use filtered water if possible.- After brewing, leave the filler lid up, and the basket door ajar. This will allow the tank to dry and prevent mold, mildew or slime from growing.- After brewing, leave the filter door open, or clean it out, and leave ajar. Keeps stuff from growing.- After any of these cleaning techniques, run a couple of pots of clean water only through it afterwards. > To sanitize: Run bleach water through it. > To reduce calcium deposits: Run vinegar water through it. > Bad calcium deposits: Run a cream-of-tarter solution water through it.",

If you pick up the handle at a slight angle, it requires only one hand(referring to other reviews), and the top can be done one handed by pushing down on the top just behind the lift tab with your fingers, lifting with your thumb. It\u2019s not rocket science.",

                "reviewText": "I've waited a couple weeks to write a review to make sure everything worked well, and this Gevi 5-cup, single switch, drip coffee maker does work very well. I chose it due to the 5 cup capacity, low price, single switch control, and reputation of Gevi. When I received it, I was pleased It also has the clearest to understand and easiest to read instructions of any previous coffee maker I've ever purchased. (Make sure you follow the cleaning instructions prior to use, of course.) This Gevi makes a very tasty cup of coffee. I've been purchasing regularly in previous decades from only one other brand of inexpensive drip single switch coffee makers, but this Gevi has won me over. If I had to list one slight dissatisfaction, it has to do with the low weight. After having used heavier 5-cuppers before, it took me a few days to adjust to how easily this machine can move on a surface in response to touch. However, that slight issue is also a big PLUS for me, because I'm also able to more easily handle the machine when it really does need to be lifted and moved onto a separate counter at times. Very happy with this one and highly recommend.",
