        "description": "The Fastest Home Coffee Makers in America, now with an updated design. Speed Brew Coffee Makers can brew 10 cups of coffee in about 4 minutes because they store hot water in a stainless steel commercial grade tank allowing them to brew coffee on demand. They\u2019re always on your counter, always plugged in and always ready to brew the perfect cup of coffee. Taller funnel - Our funnel is engineered to accommodate BUNN filters which are \u00bc Inch taller than other filters. This unique design allows for the quick flow of water and prevents overflow of coffee grounds. Tank - Compared to the other home coffee makers that \u201cburp\u201d water over your coffee grounds as it boils, our tank keeps 70 oz of water at an instantly brew-ready temperature. Temperature - Competitor systems can exceed the recommended standard of 200\u00baF, resulting in a burnt flavor. Thanks to the temperature regulated tank, the speed brew delivers a consistently ideal brewed pot of coffee. Speed brew is the only home coffee maker designed, engineered, and manufactured with the same commercial practices as the BUNN equipment trusted by cafes and restaurants worldwide.",

Just follow the 7 or 8 step picture directions and you're all set to go. Actually the maker is already assembled, the directions deal with getting the hot water reservoir filled BEFORE plugging it in which merely consists of running to full carafes of water through it.It claims to be the fastest brewer on the market at 4 minutes. Perhaps it depends on the grind but it seems to be taking 5 minutes to brew a whole pot with the coffee grounds I have. Not an issue, just show a little more patience.I had to retire my old bunn of about ten years, it had developed what seems to be a common ailment, leaky cold water reservoir, so I had been putting in about 4 glasses of water at intervals for several months now and got tired of doing that.I did buy this more expensive model of the Bunn, not sure what frills it has over the base model, but It's a sharp looking coffee maker and does an excellent job.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Bunn coffee maker for 3 reasons: 1. It has a metal reservoir. 2. It brews quickly (we are a caff/decaf mixed household so it allows separate brews in the morning) and 3. It is made in the USA. If your motivations align with the above, you will be happy with your purchase as those pros outweigh the negatives, all of which stem from any prior experience you\u2019ve had with a typical drip coffee maker.The design of the filter basket is why the brew cycle is shorter. Rather than the typical gasket/spring arrangement, the Bunn basket has a simple hole that allows the water to filter through the basket quickly. This not only speeds up the process, but because the grinds are not swimming in water for any length of time, I noticed that the coffee is less bitter and I could almost go without my normal cream. HOWEVER, it does require that you use a fine grind coffee and you actually use a tablespoon for each cup of water. Essentially, I had to upgrade my coffee and double the amount that I use. I also found that the decaf coffee was weaker than the regular coffee even with using the full recommended number of Tablespoons. I was able to equalize it by using 2 coffee filters to slightly slow down the drip without adding bitterness, and yes, use the Bunn filters. They are just a bit taller.Some people objected to the water heater running when not in use. I compromise and turn the water heater off after all the morning coffees have been brewed and turn it on again in the evening when I would normally be setting up my older auto brew drip coffee maker.The set up is clear in the \u201cquick\u201d set up instruction, regular instructions, and taped warnings on the unit itself to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS before you plug it in. The water reservoir needs to be filled completely before you plug it in.The pour spout on the carafe is a bit odd looking, but it works, so not an issue.All in all I am satisfied with this coffee maker. With the correct grinds, it produces hot, smooth coffee and it looks good on the counter\ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I got thisBUNN CSB2B Speed BrewElite 10-Cup Coffee Maker, Black, to replace a coffee maker that uses the small pods to make coffee. Granted, the pods are convenient to use because you don\u2019t have to measure anything or add coffee grounds to a basket to make coffee. But I prefer the ability to add more or less coffee grounds to the funnel on the drip type maker so I can make a pot of coffee that fits my taste buds better than the pre-measured pods.I really like this coffee maker because once it is initially heated, it lives up to the name \u201cSpeed Brew \u201c by making a pot of coffee in just a few minutes. It took approximately three minutes to make a full 10 cup carafe of delicious coffee when I checked my watch out of curiosity.The only things I don\u2019t especially like about this coffee maker are that they recommend to leave the water reservoir heater on so that the water in the water reservoir is always hot and the coffee maker is ready to brew a pot of coffee on demand. If you are like me, I want to turn the heat off after drinking my morning coffee because I won\u2019t be using it again until the next day. In order to brew a new pot of coffee the next morning, I get up and turn it on and while I am doing other things it heats the water. It takes approximately 15 minutes for the coffee maker to get heated up and ready to brew again which is not a big deal for me. But it means that if you want to get up and have a pot of hot coffee waiting for you this is not the machine for you. I bought a timer thinking I could get it ready the night before and then the timer would start the brew cycle but because of the way this is designed you can\u2019t do that. When you pour the fresh cold water in and close the lid, the water starts to run through the filter and into the carafe as soon as you close the lid, wether the water is heated or not. So when I tried the timer I ended up with a carafe of just tinted water.So if you drink a lot of coffee during the day this would be an excellent choice for you because it is always ready to brew. If you want a coffee maker that will have a pot of coffee brewed when you get up in the morning this is not the model you want.I prefer a better cup of coffee so I don\u2019t mind the extra step of heating the water each morning. If they made this so you could set up the automatic brew that some other models have it would get ten stars out of five.",
