                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars What a gem.....",
                "reviewText": "After reading the negative reviews I almost passed on this gem. Our third Bunn began leaking everywhere and a replacement coffee maker was required. I didn't want to spend $150 on another short lived coffee maker so off I went in search of an affordable alternative.After reviewing different brands on and off Amazon I decided to give this one a try. A bonus was Amazon warehouse had a like new one for a ridiculous price. Having had good luck previously with warehouse deals I pulled the trigger.Out of the box it was so not like new. Scratched and dented. A call to the awesome customer service and my sweet deal was sweetened beyond expectations. The unit itself is attractive and solidly built. The cord is of reasonable length and is not the flimsy extension cord quality of others. This is a good appliance quality cord. Clock was easy to set and read. Instructions for care and use were easy to understand. Feature set buttons are solid in construction.I set it up as per the instructions. First thing I noticed, it was leaking. Upon closer inspection it was the condensation from the lid after opening it. Now for the first pot.....yuck! As previous reviewers have noted a reduction of coffee may be required to meet personal tastes. I ended up modifying the amount of coffee AND I removed the carbon filter. What resulted was a good cup of coffee. It's not going to make a grocery store coffee taste like a coffee house drink but the quality you put in is what you get out. Quality coffee and the correct grind will give you a tasty cup of joe folks.Brew time equals about a minute a cup. I use the auto brew feature and the waiting problem is solved. I wake to the smell of fresh brewed coffee and I don't miss 3 minute brew. If I need a ultra quick cup I have a one cup machine to solve that problem.Reusable filter. Again, it's a personal preference. I feel it makes my coffee, regardless of brand taste off. I have a large quantity of basket filters left over so I modify to fit. Has worked like a charm for me with no over flow or grounds in coffee carafe/cup.Water tank placement. I'm not crazy about it as it's hard to fill without dripping. Not a deal breaker though. I do wish they'd make the volume markers darker. Just a bit hard to see.Sneak a cup feature. All I gotta say is you better be quick. Like really quick. I learned I'm not quick enough so I'll pass on this feature.Previous reviews noticed condensation at clock area. What I found was the placement of the carafe when brewing is essential to avoid this occurrence. Carafe handle straight out avoids this.Excessive steaming following brew cycle. Yes it does steam but I don't feel it's excessive. Steam cycle lasts approximately 1 minute or less max. It's not been an issue here and I'm picky. Hey, refinishing my cabinets was expensive and a lot of work. I'm not risking it.Notification volume. It's not smoke detector loud but 3 beeps rather than 5 would be my preference. If there was none I guess there would be complaints about that.Yes, there is a auto timer and after 2 hours it turns off. This is my one and only complaint. But to be really honest it's probably meant as a safety feature. I solved the problem with the purchase of a good thermal carafe. The feature just isn't a deal breaker for me.In conclusion would I recommend this pot? I sure would. I'd also recommend Warehouse Deals if you want to save money.",

                "reviewText": "OMGoosh!. We had to purchase a new coffee pot recently and searched every pot Amazon had listed. I ( the wife ) seen this one from Kenmore, and since we have Kenmore appliances we thought it had to be good. And boy does it ever. Has everything we needed right in front and lights up to see. And when the coffee comes thru it is especially hot! And stays on for two hours before going in the off mode. But you can push the auto button and it stays on for another 2 hours. Tells you when to clean this coffee maker also. Fantastic Price, and for us seniors who drink a lot of coffee a Awesome Find!",

                "reviewText": "I love this coffee pot -- it doesn't take up as much counter room due to the design, it brews quickly, and, finally, a coffee pot lip that doesn't drip all over the place when you pour! As some reviewers have pointed out, the beeps are somewhere on the order of a 5=alarm fire, but since it's just me, I don't care and my dog just gives it a \"look.\" I wonder why it has to beep when you plug it in, I find that strange as I'm well aware I'm doing the plugging and the 5 beeps when it finishes brewing or when the automatic shutoff occurs could be reduced. I must say, however, that I recently had some company and loaded it up with coffee and water should they get up first up and all they needed to do was turn it on and I slept through the beeps (my guest room is upstairs and I'm downstairs, so perhaps that was the reason). If the loud beeps are the only complaint about this wonderful coffee maker, unless you're concerned about waking up someone who just got to sleep from a night shift (or vice versa), I highly recommend it. I can't speak to the programmable setting as I've not used that to date.",

                "reviewText": "I loved this coffee maker when I got it 5 years ago. It worked flawlessly and was simple to use. Well it seemed time to get a new one since it had some wear and tear on it and thought that it was better to get a replacement before it broke. So I purchased this one again on Feb 16th. On April 28th, Less than 3 months later, the coffee maker stopped working. what a terrible shame. Normally I would try to return or repair the item. However, during this covid time alot of stores are not taking returns and I prefer not to try and fix such a new item. Now that this model no longer appears available on Amazon, I had to go out and get a new coffee maker. Sad, sad day.",

It has adjustments for smaller amount (4 cups) and has an auto shutoff feature that prevents evaporation and burning of coffee. It's good that it comes with a mesh filter so there's no need to put paper filters on it.",

                "reviewText": "Got this a few days ago only to find that it had missing parts ... (filter holder and filter). The box was sealed from the factory... So, someone there forgot to include those in the coffee maker. That rendered the coffee maker useless...ALSO, something you should be aware:The \"2 year warranty\" is with Amazon.ca and not \"Sears\" (since Sears is no longer in Canada, so forget those 1800 numbers and the \" do not return to store\" stickers...) According to what I was told by Amazon's CS rep. , IF anything goes wrong with this unit in the period of 2 years, they will cover it (replace or refund,) no worries...That said, Amazon did a good job of replacing the Coffee maker for me. SO, I am currently waiting for my new unit to arrive... (ships from the USA)This unit uses:#4 cone shaped coffee filters (won't take baskets)Mini Charcoal water filters which last 30 days or so...(these Charcoal filters are available here on Amazon as well.)Tips:Make sure to use only cold water... (the charcoal filter will do the rest)Make sure to close the lid properly (should \"click\" in place) avoids a mess...Make sure the pot\u2019s handle is facing you (so that steam escapes towards the back.)Update:Added 2 stars, the replacement unit works great and came with all parts as it should. Not really convinced about that tiny charcoal filter seems more of a gimmick... BUT it does make good coffee, the timer function works great. So, nothing bad so far...UPDATE Sept. 2019:IF you are looking for the Kenmore refills ( # 69164 .) They are the same as the KITCHENAID Filter KCM11WF. You can find these here on Amazon at very affordable prices. :)Cheers!",
