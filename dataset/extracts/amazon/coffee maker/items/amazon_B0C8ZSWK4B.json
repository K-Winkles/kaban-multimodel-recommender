But it doesn't really descale.I threw a tablet into a water kettle, ran it, and after boiling, the mineral deposits that were there before were still there.This product is not meant to go into a tank and dissolve. It's designed to go into espresso cartridges. When reading the product, I saw it was good for nespresso, so I ordered it for my nespresso machine. Nespresso machines are all the same where you put a nespresso pod in and the water from a tank is extracted to brew. It took 30 minutes to break down a tablet in the reservoir tank. Hot water helps, but the nespresso tank is not filled with hot water. The hot water comes after. Just be informed about what this does and doesn't do.",

                "reviewText": "4 out of 5 Stars (4.4)\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50[TL;DR][QUALITY] (4/5)[VALUE] (5/5)[EASE OF USE] (4/5)[MET EXPECTATIONS] (5/5)[PACKAGING] (4/5)[REVIEW REMARKS]I have an espresso machine with a water reservoir on the side. These tablets are not made for this type of unit. They are made for a portafilter style. This was not disclosed on the manufacturer's write up at the time I ordered.When the tablets arrived, the container was open in the pouch they arrived in. A couple of the tablets were crushed, but most were salvageable.The product itself is compact and a really simple way to clean the inside of your espresso machine. This tablet is formulated to clean you machine, more than descaling it. However, the package does mention descaling by name.The descaler/cleaner I received with my machine was liquid. So, I decided to pre-dissolve the tablet in water before running them through the machine. I only used one, I am not certain that it was sufficient, I just did not want too much soapy foam going into the machine. The descale setting on my machine does the heavy lifting and you just follow the recommended process. The water is foamy to start, but by the end of the cycle it is clearer. I did this until there was no foamy residue in the water. The reservoir did not have any chunks of tablets left behind, this I attribute to the pre-dissolving.All in all, I am not sure if these worked or not. I do not know if they descaled the machine adequately. However, in a couple of weeks to a month I will find out. I tend to descale this unit every six weeks. If these tablets help mitigate the oils and such that build up overtime, I cannot feel bad about this product. It is doing what it needs to. The value is excellent. If this holds true, you can get 120 cleans from one tub for these tablets. That is a pretty descent value. I recommend this product to espresso machine owners with a portafilter and backflush capable machine. Although, they seem to work on my reservoir system, the jury is still in deliberations.In the event that experiences change or evolve, updates may be made to this review to address such developments.",
