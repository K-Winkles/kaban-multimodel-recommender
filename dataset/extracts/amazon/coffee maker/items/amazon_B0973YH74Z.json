                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Keurig Yet!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We\u2019ve had the Classic and Elite Keurig. This one is the best we\u2019ve had so far in my opinion. Here\u2019s some thoughts that may help if you\u2019re trying to decide between Keurig models that I wondered about because it can be overwhelming trying to read each models options.I honestly don\u2019t think we need the WiFi option on it, but if your a person that likes to start your coffee from your phone or tablet while you\u2019re siting on the couch or in bed then this would be a neat option for you. You can do different settings in the App as well. If that doesn\u2019t matter to you then I\u2019d think about choosing the K supreme plus (without the \u2018smart\u2019 option) that has all the same options ( I believe) without the WiFi and costs less.The options on this model are more than we\u2019ve had on previous Keurigs:1. You can save personal favorite settings and just press that one button each time instead of choosing the strength and temp each time. I believe there\u2019s 3 favorite settings you can save for 3 people or 3 options .2. More options for the temperature (see the video)I put the thermometer under it while it was running at the hottest setting. ( see pictures) The hottest it got up to was 182 while dripping, the cup of coffee right when it stopped filling up was about 173 degrees . For us that\u2019s pretty hot and does get hotter than the Eilite we had previously.3. More options for the strength (see the video)4. 5 prongs vs 1 puncture the pod to get more flavor out of your coffee which I did notice.5. WiFi settings if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to have are pretty neat. You don\u2019t have to be connected to WIFi though to use the Keurig it\u2019s just an extra option.6. A lot Quieter than the other Keurigs we\u2019ve used .7. It tells you if a used pod is in the machine so you remember to take it out and not reuse it.8. It takes a picture of the coffee pod you put in and sets the machines settings to where it feels you\u2019d get the best cup of coffee from that brand or type of pod you put in and you just hit start. ( Or you can bypass it and choose what you want)9. The handle on the water side is awesome, much easier to take off and on to fill up. It hold just a little more water than the elite but looks smaller.10. It is a slimmer shape and doesn\u2019t take up a ton of room. It\u2019s kind of an L shape , you can\u2019t move the water to the back like on another Keurig model but the way it sits is great for us & still takes up less room than previous models.11. This may seem little but it has a spring to the top which makes it nicer and easier to open than previous keurigs.The time it takes to fill your cup is a little longer the stronger you go but that\u2019s a good thing in my opinion it just means it\u2019s letting the water soak into your pod to get more flavor from your coffee.People mentioned it splatters out of their cup when it\u2019s filling their cup up so I was worried about that. I did notice a few little splashes with some dots of coffee on the counter which isn\u2019t fabulous but it\u2019s really not much at all to wipe it down each time. It\u2019s really very very little.This Keurig model we feel is the best one we\u2019ve gotten due to the extra options , doesn\u2019t take up as much counter space and looks very pretty in my opinion\u2026it\u2019s not plasticky looking like the previous ones , the top part is a pretty shiny black metal and feels heavy.We bought this on sale when Amazon was having their prime day deals and very happy we did. I still think it\u2019s worth the normal price even not being on sale.",

A little too intrusive for a coffee maker. They want you to order all your items. Sometimes the coffee pods from the factory are ok and some weak. So far this comes out strong and hot. I put it on max strength and xhot, perfect. Don't need to waste coffee.",

It reads the indication code on the pod and sets the temperature and strength automatically. We find ourselves drinking the whole cup and going back for seconds. The tank is easier to see too.worked great right out of the box. Set up was simple and the phone app was also straight forward. I was originally a little hesitant to buy it because of the price but it\u2019s clearly a great value and well worth the money. I would not hesitate to buy another or recommend it to friends n family.",

                "reviewText": "*** DO NOT BUYI've used Keurig since the company's inception, never had a problem with the pots or customer support, typically top notch. Well at least until I purchased this unit. Worked great for 2 years, then one day it would not turn on, rebooting gave me the Welcome display then \"please wait...\" then a blank screen.I chatted with Keurig support over the course of 2 days, very friendly and helpful. Day 1 they pushed a software update. During the 2nd call the nice support lady stated it needs to be replaced. It was 2 yrs since my purchase, with a 1 yr warranty. She stated they would cover replacement knowing the purchase date [on file]. She sent the required email to me within minutes requisition proof of purchase/ownership. I sent photos, amazon receipts, shipping address, etc as requested.The next day I get an email stating I'm out of warranty. They would give me a 20% discount on a new pot. This is NOT what was stated to me previously over the phone. I specifically told the girl on the phone I'm 2 yrs past my purchase date and she still said it would be covered with a new replacement unit with a new 1 yr warranty. [if it sounds too good to be true...]Past Keurig coffee pots lasted many years, typically we upgraded before they failed. Now WHY would I ever purchase from a company whose high-end pot fails after only 2 years of flawless operation? Simple answer: I won't.Additionally why would they send me an email requesting proof of ownership knowing the purchase date then reject the request after I send the necessary proof. Just to waste my time? This is a deceitful business practice.Going forward I no longer recommend Keurig products.*** DO NOT BUY",

                "reviewText": "I've been interested in trying a Keurig for a while. My husband and I are seniors and we drink a lot less coffee these days.The first Keurig Supreme Plus SMART that arrived was a disaster. The water reservoir wouldn't hold water and the machine itself was stuck on displaying \"Add Water\". Customer support with the Keurig company is wonderful. The person I spoke with told me if Amazon wouldn't replace the unit they would. But Amazon sent me out a new machine the following day. I'd give 10 stars for Customer Support if I could.My first coffee from the new unit tasted funny but I found online people stating that doing a vinegar rinse followed by water would fix this and it did. I like stronger coffee and my husband likes it a lot weaker so being able to make individual cups of coffee for each of us is a plus. The Keurig app is not something we use but for younger people might be nice. Connection to our wifi was very easy and the Brew ID is kind of cool. I really like being able to set the temp for hotter coffee.Overall I like this machine and I do recommend it.",
