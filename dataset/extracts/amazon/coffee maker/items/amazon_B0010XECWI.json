I've been using an older residential model for a number of years but it finally stopped working without pounding on the brew button. This one is apparently a \"commercial\" model which seems to only mean it has a grounded AC plug. Works just as good as the old and appears nearly identical. The only other major difference is my old one had a double pod brew basket and this one only has a single pod basket. I think the coffee is always better with 2 pods for each brew. I just reused my old double basket in this one, which fits perfectly. Apparently the double pod baskets have been discontinued - unfortunately.",

I had used what I think is the exact same model in hotel rooms in the past so I figured it would be sturdy and not overly complicated.It arrives with no user manual, but the instructions are on the lid of the unit itself. I've used it a few times just to check it out -- I purchased the pods for it here on Amazon. I just use my coffee cup to measure the water, add it to the reservoir, add a pod in the tray, and push the button. Takes about 3-4 minutes, and voila! coffee. It's a decent brew -- not as good as fresh ground, but far better than instant.The only thing I found confusing is there's a red light on the front of the unit just under the \"start\" button that never comes on -- I assume it's supposed to signal either the unit \"working\" or \"finished,\" but since it never comes on, I have no idea about its purpose. No big deal, really -- it seems to work just fine without it.I'm basically happy with it so far -- it won't get a huge amount of use so I'm hoping it will last awhile. I may purchase another one for my own bedroom so I can make a cup or two while I'm working on stuff.",

We've had these in our hotel rooms for almost two years now, and they seem to be holding up just fine under normal use.With that said, I'm giving this coffee maker a 1 star rating due to the sellers here on Amazon.I've ordered this product from both US Bulk Distribution, and Beach Overstock/Estate Clearinghouse.Both times, I recieved the package on time (Thanks Amazon!), and both times the box for the coffee maker was correct, stating it was a HDC200B Hamilton Beach Commercial coffee maker.Each time, from both the sellers, the coffee maker inside was a USED coffee maker of a different brand.Both HDC200B boxes contained a noticably used CV1 coffee maker.Both had coffee stains on the bottom metal plate, hard water spots inside the the water holding area, and visibily discolored water tube from the water holding area to the brew basket area.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this so we could make a cup of coffee after dinner rather than make another entire pot. My husband and I like our coffee fairly strong. The first mug I made was like drinking lightly flavored water. I then made a second mug using only 1/2 mug of water. Coffee was still very weak. The HB brewer was very fast and I was excited to use it. Finally, I made a mug with 1/3 cup of water and 1 pod and it was good coffee. However, I see no point in making 1/3 cup of coffee and using one pod for it. Finally, as a last attempt, I tried using 2 pods for a mug and water spewed out all over the place. So, I learned not to use 2 pods at once. When I made a mug the next time, I used one pot and when it was through brewing, I took the pod out and put it in the coffee mug like I would a tea bag. After 3-4 minutes, it was strong enough to drink. I have now packed it up in the box for a future yard sale and bought a Keurig, which is absolutely fantastic.",
