                "reviewText": "I was looking for a smaller coffee pot for our travel trailer since the previous one was pretty big and counter space is limited. I thought that this was a happy medium between a single cup maker and a 12 cup. It fits very nicely on the counter and under the hood of the stove. I had low expectations since it is inexpensive, but was pleasantly surprised. It pours very cleanly. My previous coffee pot often dripped when pouring, especially if I poured quickly. The carafe is designed very well for a drip-free pour. It comes with a reusable filter, so that you don't have to use paper products, or if you run out of filters you have this one. It is cone shaped, which I think works much better if you're just making a few cups of coffee than the flat bottomed ones. The coffee brewed at a faster speed than the Mr. Coffee coffee pot but tastes excellent. The lid securely fastens down, preventing situations like things not being pushed down all the way and the water going into the area where the grinds are but not dripping down into the pot and making a big mess. A not so great feature is that there is a bright blue screen. I threw out the manual thinking I wouldn't need it and now we can't figure out how to set the time. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it over my Mr. Coffee coffee pot.",
