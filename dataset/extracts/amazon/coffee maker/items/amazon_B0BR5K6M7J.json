                "reviewText": "My Hamilton Beach percolator died after almost 2 years. This seems to be the life span for most coffee brewers of any style. Sad, but I've come to accept it. Hamilton Beach discontinued the model I had so I needed to look for another one.This one caught my eye because it has the beautiful retro look that I love. Very simple and classic. I was worried that it was a re-branded version of the Bialetti model that came out a few years ago that was just awful. If this is the same parent company, they made some definite improvements.Yes, the perk knob is GLASS. It's a thicker glass so I can see why people would think it might be plastic. You want a heavier glass so it doesn't break as easily. Still, because it is glass and the lid pulls off instead of twists off like other percolator, I recommend letting the pot cool completely before yanking on the glass top to remove the lid.Coffee snobs always say that percolators make the worst coffee. Coffee, like anything, is a matter of taste. It also depends on how you use the brew method of your choice. The biggest gripe is percolators \"boil the coffee\". This can certainly be true if using a stovetop percolator and you're not paying attention and have the heat up too high. It was also true of vintage percolators which - although nice to look at - had a much higher temperature thermostat. According to most coffee \"experts\", coffee should be brewed at between 197F and 205F. Every time I get a new percolator I take the temp of the water. This registered at 203F. Perfect. If you complain this makes \"lukewarm\" coffee, than you should get a stovetop model where you control the temp. The makers of this percolator set it within the proper range so as not to over extract the coffee and make a burnt/bitter cup.You'll really want to buy whole bean coffee and grind it to a coarse grind using a burr grinder.. not a blade grinder. I bought an inexpensive Cuisinart one a few months back and it does a great job. If you buy pre-ground coffee, not only is it far less fresh (diminishing the taste) but it is ground for drip brewers that pass the water through much faster - when a percolator brews more slowly. You'll end up with something that tastes a bit like battery acid. But then again, some people love it. It's a matter of taste. Because this has a bit longer brew cycle than my Hamilton Beach did - 6 minutes once it started perking for 4 cups (brew time is usually 6-8 minutes for a stovetop model depending on taste), I adjusted the coarseness setting on my burr grinder to make it one setting more coarse to compensate for the longer brew time. Worked great. Seriously, get a decent burr grinder and experiment with grind size. It gives you a lot more control over the flavor of your coffee.Use a paper filer. Always. Again, it's up to your taste and some die hard fans refuse to use a filter. More power to them. A good paper filter (especially the wrap/envelope style) not only keep all the grounds in the basket, but make for a smoother cup of coffee. This is true of all brew methods. It's my recommendation. I get the wrap filters at any local grocery store.My only complaint is the plug. It doesn't use a standard percolator plug. The part that goes into the base of the unit is like the female end of a typical outlet rather than the rounder plugs of most percolators. It's also made of heavy rubber. What this means is it's harder to get on and off the pot... and when you have to remove the plug after each use for cleaning, I worry it will wear down in time. Maybe not. Still, I would have preferred a traditional hard plastic connector that easily slid on and off the pot.It made a very smooth cup of coffee this morning. Overall I'm very impressed. Brews well and is quite nice to look at - and satisfying to watch brew (any percolator I use MUST have the glass knob.. I'll never tire of watching the water percolator in the bubble).The only thing yet to determine is how long it will actually last. Fingers crossed it lasts me a long time, because so far I really love this coffee pot!",

                "reviewText": "It started with the gunk that was coming out when I ran vinegar through it to clean it. Then I couldn't get all the black grease/oil off the bottom ring. I run my finger around it and it was black. Must have done it 50 times before it was almost gone. Ran 1 more water cycle through. Cleaned the machine... Then made coffee the next morning. After it was done, coffee was poured and gounds were removed and pitcher was washed out, immediately. After scrubbing, even with a brush.. there were these dots of ... Stuff. (You could argue it was coffee grounds, but I rubbed my finger across it all and there were no bumps anywhere, you couldn't feel anything) used a rag to wipe, a brush to scrub it nothing worked to get it all out. It was never allowed to dry up, either. This is straight from it brewing, to me pouring, to it getting cleaned all within a matter of minutes... This is all around the bottom nut. Could never get it all off. Did the best I could. Made another pot the next day... It's worse now. 3rd pot... Even worse, harder to get it off and it appears there is rust forming on the bottom in a circular pattern or the bottom is simply burning through. Either way. I am done. To make it all even worse... after it's done percolating... it starts making this really annoying and semi loud clicking noise. Got on everyone's nerves... I ripped the cord out. Dumped the coffee and cleaned the pitcher as best as I could and boxed it up. What a piece of junk. And unsafe. Wouldn't drink anything else out of if you paid me. Returned.",

                "reviewText": "We are using this product for about two weeks on a daily base. We love perculators! Our old one gave up. This new product ist very large for just only 4 cups of coffee. The pot can only be filled half with water. We noticed that we have to stay below the watermark that is inside of the perculator, otherwise it spills hot coffee out of the pour opening during the perculation process. Half of the pot is empty space, that is filled with a large coffee grain holder, topped with a lid. Due to the large holes in the grain holder and the lid, to much coffee grain gets into the brew. The pot is really a nice design. We on our part are not happy with the pot and hopefully are able to return it. It really misses the point of percolating good coffee. The 3 stars are for the design only.",

I haven't really anything good to say. Maybe I was unlucky and just got the one kettle that was faulty. I've returned it and waiting for a refund.
