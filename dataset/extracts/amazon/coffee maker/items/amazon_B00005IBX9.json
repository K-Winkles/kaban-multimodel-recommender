                "reviewText": "I've had the Cuisinart DCC-1200 for about a week now. I was hesitant to spend so much on a coffee maker but I'm happy to report it's well worth it. Sure, you can get other brands of coffee makers for under $25 if economy is the most important feature, but I've had those machines and I decided that, this time, a good cup of coffee was most important for me. This unit makes the best coffee I've had in a home or office machine and better than most coffee I've had in restaurants.This coffee tastes smooooooth! I suspect the charcoal water filter is the reason for that. I also like the \"shower head\" design of the water spout. The water actually runs up a track onto the underside of the lid and is sprinkled over the ground coffee like a rain shower.It's an attractive unit but it also looks like a serious coffee maker. This unit is no toy. It looks and feels solid. The carafe has a good solid feel and balance. The plastic parts (like the plastic carafe lid and handle) feel like good heavyweight plastic and are well molded. It's not the lightweight crappy plastic that cracks and discolors easily in the cheap coffee makers.I like the 5 beeps when the coffee is ready. Now I can leave the kitchen and go clean or whatever and I don't have to keep running back to see if I can get a cup yet. I can hear the beeps. But if I really can't wait and want a cup in mid-brew, I can just remove the pot and pour a cup - you've got a full 30 seconds to reinsert the pot, before you risk an overflowing filter.I like the permanent gold-tone filter too. I always thought paper filters were a pain. They'd fold over sometimes and there'd be grounds in my coffee. But you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to. I just prefer the convenience of the gold-tone filter (top rack machine washable too).It has an indicator light for cleaning -- it says it's \"self-cleaning\" but really it's just a light telling you when you need to pour in a pot of water/vinegar and run it through to decalcify the unit. (I never thought to do that with my other units. Probably another reason my coffee wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.)The low-medium-high setting on the hot plate is pretty nice too. And the auto-shutoff feature is great. I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn the machine off.The instruction booklet is very good and very thorough. Comes with a parts reordering form too.What don't I like about this machine? It requires maintenance in that you have to change the charcoal filters. But actually I don't mind since I think they are the reason the coffee tastes so smooth, and they are very easy to change and not expensive [...]Also, the area in the top of the machine where you pour in the water is narrow but again this is just a minor inconvenience. Just have to pour a little carefully.So really it's almost all positives with a couple of very minor negatives. I highly recommend this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "This unit rocks!!! I bought it after visiting a friend who had purchased their unit over two years ago and it was still making piping hot coffee for them. I rarely give anything 5 stars as it has to be near perfect for me to do so, but this unit deserves everyone of those 5 stars. I bought this product in replacement of a Sboly unit that couldn't make a hot cup of coffee to save it's life. This unit not only makes a piping hot cup of coffee but also has a dial you can set to low, medium, high that controls the warming plate after the coffee is brewed to keep the coffee hot! I have mine set to medium and even after adding a fair bit of cream to my coffee it is still piping hot. Because this unit is able to brew hot, the flavors in my gourmet coffee are wonderfully realized! The coffee maker also has a great safety feature in that you can program it to turn off at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours after it brews. You will never get in your car, get to work and wonder \"Did I turn off the coffee maker???\" ever again. Love that feature! The 12 cup volume is great. Large enough for a couple of cups to start your day for several adults. There is also a very intelligent feature that allows 2-4 cups to be made at piping hot water temps. This might seem like \"Big woop?!?!\" but most coffee makers do not properly heat the water with smaller volumes of water. This unit \"double heats\" the smaller volume of water to brew smaller batches. The unit also looks nice. I am into retro looking things and I like the little toggle switch one needs to flip up to initiate a brew cycle and the dials used to program the unit. Nice combination of stainless steel and durable black plastic housing gives it an eye-catching appearance. The unit also has the ability to filter the water with replaceable carbon-based filters. I use water that has been already filtered so this is less important to me, but if your using tap water then this is a nice feature to rid your tap water of nasty tasting chemicals before the brew process. This unit also allows foe use of paper filers or it comes with a nice gold-tone permanent filter. Another feature I truly appreciate is the small footprint. We have a small kitchen and this fits perfectly under cabinets and doesn't take up a ton of space like a lot of other high-end coffeemakers that are ridiculously overpriced. The one and only thing I would change on this coffee maker is the LCD Digital clock window is small. I would have made the clock window slightly larger especially given my aging eyes. But this is a minor issue at best. I HIGHLY recommend this coffee maker!!!",

                "reviewText": "Nothing to dislike about this. Best coffee-maker I have ever owned. Capable of brewing full-flavoured HOT coffee in small or large batches. Great extraction of flavour (I find most cone filters do this better than basket filters), and lots of customizable features. The metal \"gold\" permanent filter is a nice bonus - offers a slightly different flavour, but nice, especially if you forgot to buy filters. The water filter is a neat idea too, as long as it is easy to find replacements. I use Brita-filtered water anyway so don't really need it. I appreciate the strength selection option and the special 1-4 cup setting that makes nice strong and HOT coffee for 2 (4 cups really means 2 average mugs). Seems well put together and has a nice retro look. The only thing that doesn't work for me is the water level indicator inside, as I am short and the maker is tall, so I would need to stand on a chair and look down into it to see the water level, but as long as I measure it out properly in the first place (with the carafe) I don't really need to do those gymnastics. Did I say it makes HOT coffee? Most do not, and I have had many coffee makers over the years, so this must be emphasized. Auto shut off is nice too, as I have no memory, lol. No more baked-on coffee film on the bottom of the carafe. If this lasts, it might be the last coffee maker I will ever need. No regrets.",
