                "reviewText": "We have owned two of these and have enjoyed having delicious coffee from freshly-ground, excellent beans (Lavazza Top Choice, sometimes espresso version but usually filtro), programmed the night before. Heavenly coffee to wake up to. Both of our Black & Decker Mill & Brew coffee makers have performed flawlessly. To the reviewer who can't get her filter out: use the swing-up handle on it, and it comes right out. We had the 1st over six years, and I bought a second simply bc I didn't know how to properly clean the fine-meshed filter and it accumulated some hard debris. I scraped it out with a sharp knife! The new one, which I've easily kept clean for almost 3 years now, I just spray out with the kitchen spray hose, first inside, then from the outside along each section (sides and bottom). Takes only a minute. I also run it through the dishwasher every month or two and that's all it takes. I also give a quick rinse to the funnel that holds the filter. Easy to use, SUPERB coffee that stays hot and somehow doesn't get bitter nearly as quickly as with other coffee makers and coffee brands. Great features: select how long to grind, how strong to make, when to start brewing (immediately, or program), etc. Love it and will likely buy another just to stash in the basement to have when this one eventually goes. As grinders go, it isn't very loud, though if our bedroom door is open, we do hear it go off in the morning...this has become a very happy sound association. After over eight years, we still get excited about getting up for a cup of Lavazza Top Class, freshly ground and brewed in an EXCELLENT coffee maker. Lower maintenance than the pricey super-automatics, way more affordable, easy cleaning, and--best of all--amazing coffee. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I love this pot! It makes great coffee is easy to clean and is quiet. Mainly I was SHOCKED by how quiet it is (compared to the cuisnart) please note the following: I owned 1 grind and brew for 13 years it was used everyday. The basket door broke and I had a piece of duct tape holding it shut. My mom bought me the newer thermacrafe grind and brew. The carafe part started leaking during the brewing cycle and the replacement carafe would stop up & hot coffee would spill everywhere while brewing it lasted 3 years. The replacement I bought a glass carafe one. It lasted a year and a half. The grinder went and the door basket pops open during brewing. Same thing with its replacement.. Grinder broke door started to malfunction. DONE ! I looked at a lot of online reviews, apparently cuisnart quality is less then up to the same level it was in the early 90s when I bought my first model. I like whole bean coffee and I will not settle for a no grinding pot. I found this one on Amazon; the price was the same as the replacement grinder for the cuisnart. I love this pot. As of now I can't speak of the products longevity but it is made wellFactors other people have complained about that don't effect me1 the extra piece for cleaning ( two prices) I'm used to four pieces2 the fact you have to hit button twice to brew ?? I don't have this problem on my model3 the fact the lid doesn't come off carafe. I can still clean it so I don't careThings that make this better then the cuisnart ( I feel like such a traitor) lol1 It has a sneak a cup feature no grind and brew ever had that2 it grinds in the basket !!! Genius !!so no ongoing door malfunctions as with the grind and brew not to mention now there are two parts plus carafe to clean not four parts plus carafe3 it is quiet !! As grind and brew fans we always justify the noise the machine made I no longer need to do this there is literally no more noise4 it has a stronger brew feature and the grinder adjusts to the amount of beans 4 6 8 10 12 cups5 the water reservoir is on the outside so it's easy to see how much water is actually in there6 the design keeps the machine cleaner. If you know cuisnart grind and brew you know you spend a lot of time cleaning grinds out of every crevice & srubbing out around the grinder part no more!!! Hurray !7 makes a awesome cup of coffee !!Please keep in mind I only use whole bean coffee so that is what I base my reviews on.Love this pot",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Your coffee house won't miss you, but you may arrive after your first cup when you start using this B&D mill & brew!I was (kinda) hoping to get that coffee house flavor with this. I figure it's a \"regular\" drip coffee maker, with a grinder. It pretty much is. No blooming, no rain shower brew head so get the best beans that you can. Because those are what makes the cup. I have been playing around with beans for some time now, since getting this coffee maker & I actually came across the ones which make the brew house coffee that I have been trying to make at home (see review elsewhere here). The pot helps, but it's the beans!\"I don't want a decent cup of coffee. I want a great cup of coffee\". Before finding the right coffee (I'm not done by any means). The bottom line is that it's about the beans, & so few miss the mark.I was only rating this machine at about a 3.5. It behaves very well, & the nearly direct brew is good. My 12 dollar drip does that. I really like the flavor that comes from the brews on this B&D. I don't like that you can't add a paper filter, as I \"found\" it helps with reducing cholesterol, but I can actually. You don't always have to grind in the unit. You can pre grind. you beans.I am happy that I purchased this one, over the \"other\" popular one. As you can hear from the video, this really is super quiet! Which was one of the factors in it's purchase, the other was that the path is more direct, after grinding. Which gives you all of the oils & flavor. Even simple beans taste decent.For the most part it grinds up all of the beans (and quickly), leaving only a few on top sometimes. You can use the 6 grind for a four if you'd like, which will give it more grind time, but often I think it should stop sooner.Strength settings. When on max, it tends to get close to over flowing the grounds (grinds) into the pot, so be careful there. If you're trying to extract as much as you can, you may want to find something else, or use the 6 scoops for 4 grind & hope it works better for you.Clean up isn't bad. It does take WAY more time than a basket. I compost my grounds, but can't get everything out. There are less grounds or dust than other machines, but there are more crevices on this.Overall I am very happy that I picked this Black & Decker Mill & brew machine up. I have a bunch of B&D stuff in my house, & now I have some fresh B&D coffee to start my day with. Who doesn't like a little to start their day?It's a twelve cup carafe, so it's large compared to the 5 cup units I usually buy. For those who want more control over the amount of coffee they use. You can grind 4 but add any amount of water. It grinds on one setting, but always brews what's in the tank. Which is an easy way to overcome the extra strong overflow mentioned above.Anyhow, bottom line after using a few bags of beans. I am very glad that I went with this Black & Decker Mill & Brew coffee maker. I really was leaning towards two other ones, as well as a commercial maker, but saw this one suggested so pondered it for nearly a month. Stop pondering & get the cup of coffee you deserve. Sunday's breakfast is so much more delightful with a little B&D brewing in the kitchen.Oh, one more thing. I detest the translucent side fill window. They (and everyone) have to make it darker). The second pot is okay, the condensation marks where you were at the last time.",

I was always hesitant about buying a machine with a built in grinder because I assumed it would require too much cleaning but not this guy. You can remove the filter basket as well as the interior basket with the shower head so you can make sure everything is squeaky clean before you make coffee again. Super easy. Also Black & Decker makes a good product. My previous coffee maker was a B&D basic bitch model and I had it for over 10 years at least. Over all, great product and worth the money.",
