This Braun automatic drip coffee maker is easy to fill, easy to clean, makes great coffee very quickly*. I've had this a bit over a month. It took a few brews to dial in the amount of beans to grind (about 5-10% more than in my previous machine) and the amount of time* to grind the beans (about 35% longer than for previous machine). Features are nice and easy to use. Very satisfied. Quality, solid product as you would expect from Braun. *I found that I had to grind longer to get a finer grind since the machine brews so quickly. You'll want to have finer grounds for the water to drip through. The finer grounds slow down the drip and lets the coffee brew properly. Otherwise you'll get a weak pot of coffee w/ the same amount of grounds. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "This makes the best tasting coffee of any coffeemaker I've ever owned. Smooth tasting and nice and hot right after brewing--you don't have to let it sit on the burner plate to get hot. I use the charcoal filters and I think that has a LOT to do with the great taste, but using them is optional. I have never cared for the gold tone filter that a lot of coffeemakers come with, so I just don't use it. I much prefer paper filters, and this takes the #4 cone filters. Easy to program, VERY nice, sleek design, and as another reviewer stated, the pot slides easily in and out--doesn't get hung up on the drip mechanism. It brews quietly, and it does not beep at all when starting or finishing. That never bothered me with my other coffeemakers, but I don't miss it either-lol. I know some people find the beeping to be annoying. The green LED light came on when it was time to clean, which in my case was five (5) weeks after I started using it, so I expect it to always be about the same. So when I clean it, that's when I change the charcoal filter--makes it easy to keep track of. A lot of people will be able to go longer than 5 weeks, but I have VERY hard water. I used vinegar, not a commercial cleaner, and it works great. This is replacing a Mr. Coffee that was really great--for the whole 4 1/2 years that it worked! Braun is a good name, a good brand, and I expect to get several years out of it! Buy it--you won't be sorry!",

                "reviewText": "My last Braun coffeemaker lasted 20-25 years (I lost track). Until it didn\u2019t. One morning I filled it up, turned it on, and nothing \u2014 no noise, no sputtering, no leaking, just the glow of its little forlorn light and clock. So when I went looking for a replacement, I considered no brand but Braun. I didn\u2019t need a 14 cupper, and the 12 cup version in black was less expensive than stainless steel. Besides, the ancient one was black. It works great, makes good coffee, just like my old workhorse. I didn\u2019t really need 12 cups, but I appreciate the 1-4 cup adjuster. It does appear to do \u2026 something. Did I mention my old coffeemaker died the day before Thanksgiving? Bless, Amazon, the new one arrived on Friday well in time for Saturday morning coffee.A few design deficits, proving that newer is not always better:- It\u2019s hard to tell exactly where to pour the water into the reservoir and easy to miss. Been there, done that, already.- I figured out how to remove the filter basket, but I feared breaking it on my first attempt. Once out, I learned it won\u2019t stand up on its own for filling. (The ancient one did.) That means either prop it up (on what, pray tell?!) or fill it in place. The problem with filling in place? Before I\u2019ve had my coffee, my aim isn\u2019t always spot on. And I have no idea how to get errant coffee grounds out of the water reservoir where I\u2019m sure they will wreak havoc.- The clock is so dim as to be virtually worthless.- This unit is a bunch bigger \u2014 taller, wider, hulkier \u2014 than my earlier model. Why?But still, Braun makes a damn good cuppa coffee. And that\u2019s the real test, right?",

The only difference this pot is to the others I have had (3 Cuisnart) is that I can adjust how long the hot plate stays on. I set mine to 3 hours. This pot does not sound to signal coffee is ready. Does not have a BOLD option. It is sleek & I like the look of it. I only bought to replace the one I had that was functional but the coffee again was not as hot as I would like. I have tried the pots that have a thermal decanter which is useless unless you heat the thermos with hot water prior using. Even then not great. I change my coffee pot every 2 years regardless if it is working or not. Thought pricing up would make a difference. At the end of the day this is a very very basic coffee maker. On a good note it has a good warranty.",
