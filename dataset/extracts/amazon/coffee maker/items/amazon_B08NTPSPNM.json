                "reviewText": "I opted for this single cup capsule coffee maker at a deep discount, which makes it approximately a quarter of the price of the most well known name brand.It's very simple to use. I can use either a K cup or the reusable cup that comes with the machine. There is no reservoir. The water you pour in is the water you are going to get out, from 6 to 14 ounces.I opted for a 10 ounce cup and placed 2 tablespoons of grounds in the reusable cup. It takes a few minutes to receive a cup of coffee. The temperature of the coffee upon completion was just under 180 degrees.The results were a little light for my taste so I will use a little more coffee from now on. But it was a pleasant cup.This little guy is not a work horse. It needs a breather between cups.My plan is to take this to my workplace, so I can keep my coffee-snobbery to myself and have a fresh cup of something stronger than the dishwater available in the break room. NOTE: Amazon Basic makes a larger version of this machine that does have a reservoir for multi cup use, and a couple other neat features. There's a terrific review video included in the images of the item",

Is still going strong today (January 2024). It has lasted longer than our last 2 K-Cup brewers. We average about 5-6 cups of coffee/day. This brewer does not have all the bells and whistles of other brands. No clock, no auto start in morning, no bottom heater. It does auto shut of after finishing a brew and turns back on when push the size select button. It 6 oz to 14 oz brews. Be aware, the brews are actually a bit oversized.Coffee is just as good as the more expensive brewers. This standard size brewer has a 24oz reservoir. Highly recommend, very fair price.",

                "reviewText": "I received the Amazon Basic coffee maker today (1/6/24) and tried it for the first time. The water reservoir is only 24 ounces but that's okay for me because it's easier for me to fill since I have dexterity issues with my hands and wrists. What I did was fill it right below the MAX line.I used a reusable K-cup pod in the K-cup attachment that comes with it. so those who say you can't use it, YES you can. I use whole beans because I like to grind my own coffee beans very fine. I have the reusable colored K-cup pods that have a colored part that you place even with the groove in the reusable K-cup pod attachment and put the tab facing up.Nothing splattered from the machine onto the counter. I put the drip tray in the upper part to use a small cup. It does take a little bit for the water to heat, but the coffee came out of the reusable K-cup just fine with no issues and the coffee tasted great. Again, I don't mind the 24-oz water reservoir because it's easier to fill even though you have to fill it as you need to. Next time I'll try the reusable K-cup-like attachment that comes with the coffee maker. so far, so good with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "This product is the cheapest I have found by ALOT. I was worried because how much cheaper it is. IT works just as good. They have ALOT of oz options which was key for me. I almost bought the 150$ one until i saw no 12 oz? i was like wtf no 12 oz thats the main one. Then another had no 12 or 10 only 4 and 6 . This one has 10 and 12 and another higher one. The only problem is you have to refill the water very often that is ALL. If you are too lazy to put water in then this is not for you but other then that it works just as good and better in some areas then the expensive ones.",

Taking that few seconds longer means the water is actually utilizing the coffee grounds as it passes through. We love this little machine. It also takes up very little space on the counter and is really easy to use. Pour the amount of water you want (use the cup you're making coffee in to measure), put a pod into place, push the button... and about a minute and a half later, you get a good, hot cup of brew.",
