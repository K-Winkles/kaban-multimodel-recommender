I was looking at another popular brand but reviews had complained that the carafe was poorly designed so that every time they pour a cup of coffee it dribbles rather than having a clean pour. Some reviews mentioned that this was a much better designed pot. I find that to be true. I also love the sort of retro design of the coffee pot. Overall it works well - brews well, keeps it hot, and it comes with a permanent filter (a feature I was desiring). No complaints; I love it.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this little pot. It makes two nice cups of coffee, which is perfect for me in the morning. The brewed coffee comes out very hot and the warmer keeps it hot. I've had other pots where that is not the case. Its compact size is also perfect in that it does not take up much counter space. It's a little odd that the water reservoir is on the left side of the unit so you need to pour it in with your left hand. Guess it's giving us a taste of what it's like to be a south paw lol. The only negative is that you can't pull the coffee pot out before the brew cycle is done because there is no stopper, but that's not a big deal to me. I still give it five stars. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "Got a little tired of scratching my hand on sharp edges every time I tried to wipe out the small \"Mr. C\" pot. So when that maker died, I chose this slightly larger machine to replace it. Not disappointed. The pot handle has no sharp edges inside and the opening is slightly larger than the old maker, so cleaning and drying is a breeze. I like my coffee VERY strong, so I also appreciate the flip-down cover for the basket - it completely eliminates the \"foam-over\" problem I frequently encountered in the past. Finally, the brew temperature is just right for dark roast coffee and the hotplate is not too hot - the coffee easily keeps without degradation for up to about 20 minutes.",

                "reviewText": "Nothing to complain about this coffee maker. It's cheap, it works, it makes delicious coffee. A few notes from my first week:One or two reviews commented that the coffee wasn't hot enough. These people must have tongues of steel because I definitely need to let my drink cool down for about 5 minutes after pouring it or my mouth will get scorched.About the reusable basket. I agree that it should be cone shaped-style as opposed to the flat style, and it's strange to me that there's only mesh on the sides and not the bottom. It still gets the job done just fine though. And seriously people, it's too hard to clean? It takes approximately 30 seconds to clean out the mesh filter and pop in back into place. Save some paper!About the warped top. My parents have the old model of this coffee maker and that top definitely would warp when it was brewing. So far, I haven't noticed any warping on the lid of this model, and the plastic seems much heavier/stronger than the old model. I don't think it will warp, but will update if any issues arise.Finally, about the coffee strength. I do notice that this coffee seems a little weaker than my old coffee maker. I'm not sure if this is because a) the coffee grinds I'm using is different from my previous brand b) the mesh filter's flat style doesn't work as well as a conical style/paper filter or c) I just haven't found the sweet spot of grounds:water yet.Overall, if you read through all this, you're overthinking it! This is a solid $20 coffee maker and if you hate it get another one after a year or two.EDIT: Update, 11/26. As far as the coffee strength goes, the initial weak coffee taste I noticed was definitely from the grounds and not the maker. Since buying a better brand of grounds, my morning coffee comes out strong and hot!",

The water tank has a larger opening on the left for easier pouring of water.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly for an inexpensive coffee maker I'm very impressed. In my area we have very hard water and I've replaced too many other coffee machines. I figured this one was inexpensive so I wouldn't feel bad if it went. However, all of my expectations were completely surpassed. This is the longest lastly coffee maker that I've owned (previously owned kcup style coffee makers) so granted I wouldn't be able to directly compare to other drip coffee makers.This unit is easy to use and my favorite part is how simple it is to clean without having to buy expensive solutions or go through a daylong process. I always buy freshly roasted beans and grind them right before brewing and the results have been excellent. My other method is making pour overs and this brewer doesn't quite get to that standard but it makes up for it in ease of use.One other thing to mention is that a lot of people that own coffee makers with a heating plate complain about is leaving the coffee on the plate for a bit will give it a burnt taste. This is something I haven't experienced with this coffee maker. There were times where I've turned the machine on and forgot only to remember 20 minutes later and it didn't taste burnt at all so extra credit there.Lastly I'll touch on the sneak a cup feature. Basically there is a spring loaded stopper that gets pushed up by the pot to allow the fluid in. As I learned when you pull out the pot it'll drip a bit and ends up on the warming plate and can be messy. Also, you only have a very short time to do this so have a cup ready before sneaking or else the chamber will fill up and the stopper will not hold that pressure. I got lucky once in that exact situation and as it started to stream out I was able to replace the pot to minimize the mess but just be aware.Overall definitely worth the money!",
