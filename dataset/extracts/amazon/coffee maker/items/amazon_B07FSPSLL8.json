                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great machine!",
                "reviewText": "After a few years of pour-over coffee and extensive overthinking, I decided to purchase this coffee machine.There were a few things I deemed important in my coffeemaker search. First, I wanted to be able to schedule my coffee to brew just before I wake up and zombie-shuffle into my kitchen. Second, I wanted a machine that could make more than 6-8 liquid cups. When family visits, the pour over carafe capacity is never enough so we\u2019re constantly making third or fourth carafes of coffee daily. That gets time consuming and very annoying. Third, it was important to still have great flavor. Pour over and has a great taste and I did not want to lose that. Finally, I wanted the coffee to stay hot. My glass pour-over carafe cooled too quickly and I\u2019d have one mug of hot coffee before I had to begin microwaving, which doesn\u2019t keep coffee hot for very long, either.I decided to buy this coffeemaker after reading reviews on several machines at a few different online stores. I chose this Braun after reading many pretty good reviews. The price was doable and I really liked the aesthetic I saw in the pictures.I got the machine yesterday and set it up. It came with a charcoal water filter (lasts a year) and a cone shaped, reusable mesh coffee filter. The charcoal filter is not necessary to the operation of the machine but IT\u2019S A FILTER, people. Although I already have a water filter attached to my kitchen faucet, the charcoal filter comes with the machine, so I\u2019m using it. There are specific instructions on how to activate the filtering properties of the charcoal pod so be sure to read those in the manual before inserting it into the machine.The reusable mesh basket looks very nice but I haven\u2019t tried it because I have several paper filters (cone, size #4 fits perfectly) and I like the flavor of the coffee when I use them. When I run out, I\u2019ll likely switch to the reusable filter.When I set up the machine yesterday, I ran the machine through once with only water, as recommended by the manufacturer, to remove dust that may have settled into the machine. I timed this cycle for funsies (on the \u201cregular\u201d brew setting) and it took a little under 10 minutes to fill the carafe. I have not tried the bold or fast brew settings yet. After this initial cleaning cycle, I washed the pot and mesh filter.Setting the time, water hardness level, and the auto-brew function was easy with the manual, but you do have to push the power button before you can activate certain features. I feel it is pretty important to read the instruction manual. Side note- after I set the clock, I unplugged the machine while I poured water into the water tank (because I don\u2019t want to get electrocuted, plus the manual says to do this). I did not have to set the clock again after I plugged it back in. That was a neat little function.Last night, I set the auto-brew function to make coffee at 8:30 am this morning. It worked great, the coffee stayed hot, and it tasted awesome! And if you, like me, slowly go through a pot of coffee throughout the morning and early afternoon you can turn the warming plate on again. Press the power button, then the \u201cbrew\u201d button and it will keep the plate hot for another 2 hours.All in all, I have no complaints so far and I\u2019m very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The coffee maker is overall well designed and the touch interface is easy to navigate. The clock tends to lose time rather quickly, so keep the directions handy as setting the clock is un-intuitive. Everything works well, except for the carafe, which ALWAYS dribbles some coffee. This seems to be a persistent Braun problem, so unsure why it has never been fixed. I have not used the included gold filter as in the past these have left much more residue in the pot/cup than paper filters. Bottom line, it make a good, hot cup of coffee. I have only used it with small batches, never brewed a full pot so cannot comment on that performance. In my experience, coffee makers are usually at their worst with SMALL batches, so I would imagine this would work well for full pots. The machine is well made, attractive and the clock (while inaccurate), has a nice large display, easy to read!",

                "reviewText": "This is our second of the same model. The difference in the newer model is there is no longer a temp for how hot to keep the coffee, but it still seems hot enough. It look nice in stainless. As some others have mentioned, pouring the coffee can dribble a little - i just pour slow and it is usually fine.one of the reasons we first purchased this model is that there is no beeping. previous coffee makers we had would beep when one, beep when turning off, etc. this one? SILENT... you wont be disappointed.",

I ran one batch of water through it and then it was ready to go. I've had bad experiences with previous purchases where there is a strong chemical/plastic smell. There was no odor with this one. I've only just started using it, so I can't comment on durability, but seems to be fine in this regard if I had to guess. Will update if not.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a big fan of coffee maker coffee. Over the last 2 decades, I've alternated between pour over coffee set ups (Hario and Chemex), Brazilan press coffee (Bodum) and stove top espresso, for my daily coffee routine. However, due to the nature of my last job, I invested in a an automatic drip coffee maker. After extensive research, that almost had me buying a Bonavita or the more expensive Moccamaster, I settled on this model for a number of reasons. I am glad I did. This is an excellent machine that produces an excellent, robust coffee. The machine is easy to clean and is also easy to program for automatic coffee preparation at a desired time in the day. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the glass carafe, but I've learned to accept it. For those that don't mind having their coffee cook in a glass carafe on heated base, this machine will do the trick. I personally don't like the taste of the coffee after it's been heated for a while, so I chose to empty the contents immediately in an insulated container.Oh, and it's quite easy to make less than full batches as well as to adjust the coffee strength.Excellent machine and great value!",
