                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love this coffee maker! Great tasting, very hot coffee",
                "reviewText": "Update: The first one I bought lasted about 19 months. The price has increased almost 50% since I bought that one. When it died I tried a few other models that are less expensive. After a day or a week I returned those and ultimately bought another one of these. I\u2019ve had my second one about 11 months now. I will likely never buy anything else. Best coffee I\u2019ve ever been able to make at home. It used to be if you bought something from Cuisinart you could expect to still have it in five years. I wish that was still the case, but if I\u2019m being completely honest I would buy a new one of these every year if I have to.I looked at every model of thermal carafe coffee maker and read a lot of reviews before choosing this one.This is, by far, the hottest coffee I have ever gotten from a home coffee maker. For me, this is a huge selling point.The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot enough to enjoy without microwaving for at least 4 hours. Even after 6 or 7 hours the coffee is still warm and tasty. Because it does not use a warming plate to keep the coffee hot, the last drop of coffee tastes as good as the first. I will never go back to a glass caraf. I like the flavor of my coffee better than I have with any other coffee maker I've ever owned.The carafe is large. It holds almost 2 liters if you fill it to the 12 cup mark.The pour spout is designed specifically so It doesn't dribble all over the place when I pour.It makes the coffee pretty quickly. Speed depends on the settings you use and, obviously, how much coffee you're making. A full pot without the bold setting is read in about 11 or 12 minutes.It is completely programmable so you can setup the coffee to be ready at whatever time you'd like. It also has a \"1-4\" button for if you're making 1 to 4 cups of coffee, and a \"bold\" button if you like stronger coffee. Those two buttons have a similar function. They slow the water flow over the grinds so you get the full flavor in a small pot, or a bolder flavor in any pot.A note about pouring because I've seen some reviewers that didn't like how the pot pours. I don't use the pot to fill the reservoir with water. I did that the first time and it pours way too slowly. That was aggravating. That may be why others complained. So I use a plastic pitcher for filling the reservoir. It appears that the top to the pot is designed to control the flow rate when pouring. I see this as a positive. When I'm filling my coffee cup I'm never wishing it would pour faster. I'm just glad coffee isn't getting all over the counter, the floor, or me.I noticed some reviewers said the buttons stopped working after a few months or a year. I will say that it doesn't take much force at all to get a response from whatever button you push. Because of those reviews I make a point of not using much force when I hit \"Brew\" or whatever button I'm pushing. If you poke them hard over and over, I could see them not working anymore after awhile.This coffee maker looks nice in my kitchen. If you have stainless steel appliances it will match. It takes up a very reasonable amount of space on my counter. The measurement lines are on the right side in the middle; however you can pour the water into the reservoir from either side. The reservoir is the whole back of the unit and is accepts water on either the left of the right side.The filter basket is cone shaped. It comes with a gold screen reusable filter insert. I still use a paper filter in that as well because I don't like any sediment in my coffee. The paper cone filters cost a little more than standard filters but not so much that it is deal-breaker for me. A few extra dollars every 3 or 4 months.You have the option to use a charcoal water filter, but if you never use one it doesn't change how to unit performs. The charcoal filter's purpose is to filter things like the chloriine flavor out of your water. I use it.Some reviewers complained that the instructions are lacking in detail. Maybe the manufacturer has updated them since then. For the most part the setup is all pretty logical. The one thing I found difficult to figure out and not explained in the instructions was getting the charcoal filter into the filter holder. Turns out it is apparently so easy it looks hard. I included a few pics. On the stem portion of the charcoal filter holder is the word \"open\" with an arrow pointing downward. Right below that on the base is a little notch that sticks up. Just gently pull on the little notch and the front of the base flips open. The back left corner of the water reservoir has a slot cutout in the bottom to hold the base of the charcoal water filter setup. You just gently set it down in there. You don't have to force it. And it stays in place. The last pic is of the cutout in the bottom of the water reservoir. Other than that setup was really easy. The filter basket only fits in one way. It's a no-brainer to see where the water goes. The instructions tell you how to use all the buttons and features.There is a ready tone that beeps 5 times when the coffee is finished brewing. It's pretty loud. If you don't like that, you just press the \"Tone\" button near the clock face and the ready tone is off.It comes with one charcoal water filter, several cone shaped paper coffee filters, and a coffee scoop. Amazon sells the charcoal filters and the paper cone filters for very reasonable prices.I've been using this coffee maker since the day after Christmas 2019 and I have no complaints. I will update this review if anything changes. I've had a Bunn, and several models of Hamilton Beach over the course of 20 years. So far, this is the best coffee maker I've ever owned.",

                "reviewText": "This Cuisinart coffee maker is our new favorite for several reasons! In our house, coffee is like oxygen. We need it to exist. We've been through many coffee makers over the years, and this one is definitely a keeper! Why? I'll tell you:1) We drink our coffee black and as strong as possible, so taste is extremely important. NO covering up weak or bad tasting coffee with creamer or sweetener. This coffee maker delivers a cup of great tasting coffee, and the machine has the option for regular or BOLD - so obviously we choose bold.2) We like to drink our coffee throughout the morning, and want it to be HOT without having to reheat it. The stainless steel carafe keeps the coffee at the perfect temperature for several hours. We have it programmed to brew at 5am, and it's still nice and piping at 11am. Since the coffee maker does not remain on for hours after brewing, there is no risk of burnt tasting coffee, or getting that burn ring underneath the carafe like we have with glass carafes in the past.3) We prepare the coffee at night before bed, and don't want to spend forever getting it set up, OR cleaning it! I have read reviews stating that it is hard to clean the carafe, and it is hard to fill the water reserve with the carafe. I use a bottle brush with a long handle (same as I use for my tall stainless steel water bottles) and have no problem cleaning the inside of the carafe. With regard to filling up the water reserve, keep the lid on the carafe when pouring to avoid spilling, and then pour from the other direction to fill up that last bit - OR - use something other than the carafe to fill it up!Great tasting coffee, easy to use, easy to clean - win win win!",

                "reviewText": "When my last coffee maker died recently I was in the market for a new one and settled on this Cuisinart model after a lot of research. The machine itself is easy to operate and makes a pretty good cup of coffee. What I wish I had done differently was order the glass carafe rather than the metal thermal carafe. This model coffee maker offers both options. When considering the carafes I decided on the thermal one because the glass carafes can break and the heating plate does \"cook\" the coffee while keeping it hot which ruins it if it isn't poured relatively quickly. I also have had every coffee makers heating plate eventually rust not matter how carefully I maintain it. I thought the thermal carafe was a better option and would keep the coffee hot and tasting like it was freshly brewed. The coffee stays hot but the flavor does change if left for a while. But what really bothers me is the carafe itself. It is extremely heavy and when coffee is poured it tends to splatter everywhere. The carafe is constructed in a way that does not allow you to pour all of the coffee out and the opening at the top is too small to clean it easily. There is no way for any adult to put their hand into it and scrubbing with a brush is not very effective. Like a thermal travel mug residue and tannins builds up inside the carafe affecting the flavor. I have only had my coffee maker a couple of months and the inside of the carafe is already stained. I haven't yet figured out how to clean it correctly.",

                "reviewText": "Loving this Cuisinart. Great coffee, great settings, great window to accurately add water, carafe is slick design that you dont have to fiddle with buttons or paddles or anything else. A valve in then lid lets the coffee in as it brews, and cleverly opens only once you tip the carafe to pour. Does require patience though as the rate of pour is glacial and can sputter a little making a mess. But coffee remains hot for at least 3 hours if you preheat the carafe, and of course it's never burnt like a heat element might be. Water filters are easy to source and replace, and the permanent filter does a great job giving me all the flavors and oil without any of the grounds. As with any fine mesh you will get a bit of residue, but not bad at all. So glad I chose this model!",

Pros: Looks beautiful on my counter, it's not overly large and the stainless steel compliments my other appliances. Very simple to use, especially when programming your coffee for the morning. I like the fact that after the coffee brews you have an alert sound in which you can choose to turn off or on. Very easy to see the water level on the side when pouring the water in. Coffee is very hot when brewed. Coffee carafe keeps coffee hot for quite sometime. I left coffee in the carafe over night and it was still lukewarm the next day. Cons: When pouring the coffee from carafe you have to practically turn it up side down. You must pour slow or the coffee will spray all over. In order to clean the pot you'll have to get a scrub brush as you can't fit your hand in the carafe. Overall the pros out weigh the cons. I'm definitely keeping this machine it's make a great cup of coffee!",
