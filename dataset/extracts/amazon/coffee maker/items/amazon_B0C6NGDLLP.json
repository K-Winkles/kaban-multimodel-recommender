            "INCLUDES BREW-AND-SERVE CARAFE \u2013 Brew directly into the included carafe made of crystal-clear Tritan. Then, easily pour the brew into one or more cups and serve.",
            "UNIQUELY DELICIOUS: No more average joe from fancy, expensive machines. By combining the best of several brew methods into one patented device, you get smooth, rich, grit-free coffee with a delicious, full-bodied finish that lingers well after your last sip. No bitterness. No cream needed.",
            "PATENTED 3-IN-1 BREW TECHNOLOGY: The only press that combines agitation and pressure with micro-filtration so you can use finer ground coffee. Hot water is pushed through the grinds, quickly aerating and extracting only the purest, freshest flavors, while keeping grit and bitterness out of your coffee.",
            "BETTER THAN FRENCH PRESS: No more bitterness or grit. The patented 3-in-1 brew technology of the AeroPress XL Coffee maker eliminates bitterness and acidity and creates a smooth, rich, full bodied cup of coffee. Paper or metal micro-filters allow you to use finer ground coffee for a faster brew time and no grit (unlike the mesh filter of a French press). No more messy coffee grounds \u2013 clean-up takes seconds! Durable, shatterproof design, perfect for travel, camping & gifting."

The process removes the oil one can see at times in a cup of coffee, and filters out any degree of bitterness that is there.

                "reviewText": "I had a pretty intensive pour over routine going on, requiring multiple pours, timing and measuring each one. I now use the Aeropress XL (using the inversion method), and put in 30G coffee, grind setting of 10, stir for ten seconds, and let steep for another minute. Then I push it out and I have a great large cup of coffee. I had also previously used the original Aeropress, but found that it did not make enough coffee for me. AeroPress is my chosen method of brewing now, and I have pour over cones, French Press, and even Bialetti stove top espresso maker. Easy to brew, easy to clean, no-compromise taste.",

This is the biggest disappointment to date using Amazon. I cannot for the life of me figure out how any of the glowing reviews can be associated with this product. Also, it is a device that is used with boiling water and the instructions on use are clearly putting the user at significant risk of scalding, as evidenced by some of the reviews on this site. There is no protection at all, not even any insulation from the hot surfaces in use. Putting all of this together means it is being returned, as is the accompanying additional components I ordered to complete the set up. Shocking product!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, I wanted to address several peoples comments about the tightness of the rubber seal being hard to put in and out of the main cylinder. This loosens up from usage, mine is now perfect. Nothing to worry about at all.I came from a Aeropress 'GO' where I was making large brews via a concentrate, initially I could not get the XL to make brews as balanced as my GO. Eventually I found the formula that clicked for me, it was after reading someone's comments on reddit that the extra water keeps the slurry hotter for longer. I found that by going coarser AND leaving the cap off until the end (to let the steam off) I can get brews as good as my GO, but with the now easier sizing options. Super pleased, such a good product. For anyone not getting the same results as their standard or GO, stick with it, it really can make coffee as good as the other models.",

                "reviewTitle": "Like the original, but worse",
                "reviewText": "While I wouldn't say it's terrible, the XL has quite a few negatives compared to the original, which I don't think is worth it on balance.For the pros: It's still basically an Aeropress, so most of the basic techniques will still work, you'll get mostly the same brew, and you'll be able to make more at once. It gets most of its stars from the strength of the original design here.For the cons: It's dramatically more expensive (upfront, and in extras and consumables) and quite unwieldy. Inverted brewing is a little less stable; The press doesn't fit on normal-sized mugs anymore meaning the carafe is a requirement; The carafe feels a little too small to hold a full load from the Aeropress and gets too hot to easily hold after pressing (I tend to have to press about one cup then awkwardly hold the press and carafe to pour some out, to avoid spilling from the press). You get less accessories (no filter holder or funnel), significantly fewer complimentary filter papers (which cost significantly more in the official store) and what extra accessories do exist seem to be less ubiquitus and more costly (although some of that is explained by the newness of the product).Overall, I think this is only really useful if you, for some reason, *really* need to brew two coffees at once, in an aeropress specifically - not just brew one-after-the-other or use a different method - and I just don't see that being a significant niche. If this was their first attempt then I might be kinder, but it's trading on the good name of the original while forgetting a lot of what made it useful. Go for the original if you're drinking for yourself, or go for a more traditional method if going for bulk brewing.",
