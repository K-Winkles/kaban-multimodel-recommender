        "description": "An elegant way to serve coffee to dinner guests, this classic stainless-steel percolator brews from 4 to 12 cups of great-tasting coffee. The unit circulates piping hot water through coffee grounds and pulses up into the glass knob on top to create the familiar percolating sound that coffee lovers love. A ready-to-serve light indicates when the coffee has finished brewing, and the detachable cord makes it easy to serve freshly perked coffee right at the table without any hassle. Other useful features include a precision drip-free spout, a simple-grip knob on the unit's lid, and a stay-cool bottom that allows the percolator to sit safely on any surface without scarring. Combining present-day technology with the retro look of a '50s kitchen, the percolator measures approximately 8 by 6 by 12 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. Editor's note: This is a remanufactured small appliance. Remanufactured generally means that the appliance has been returned to the manufacturer, who returns the appliance to like-new condition. Some appliances may contain cosmetic blemishes.",

I was ready to shell out $50+ for one when I ran across this one. At THIS price, how could I NOT get it? Let me tell you, I love it. Rich coffee, rich aroma, and rich pockets since it was less than 1/3 the price of a new one. I can't speak on longevity just yet, but I will update. Yes, a few grinds of the fine ground coffee gets pass, but you won't even see them until you get to the very bottom of your cup. All percolators do this. To remedy this, just use the 3.5\" perc filters. You get 100 for about a buck. Also, let me say that this thing is beautiful. Mirror finish with a unique shaped handle. And the way the \"skirt\" sits flushed on the countertop, lovely. And, of course, the clear knob on top. Who dosen't turn into a big kid when they see the coffee percolating? Something this nice for this price I had to give it five stars.",

It is very sleek, doesn't take up a lot of room on the counter & makes great coffee in around 4 minutes. We simply fold a regular coffee filter into quarters & tear a very small hole to fit over the inside piece, use regular ground coffee (put your finger over the top of the metal tube that fits into the clear top piece to keep coffee out of the pot circulation). The smell & sound of coffee perking was missing with our Bunn drip coffee maker. The coffee is hotter than the Bunn too. We love it & have actually ordered a total of 4 for gifts & to have an extra percolator when this one burns out.",

I have been using drip coffees for quite a long time. Since chemistry was one of weaker subjects. I could never seem to get the ratio right. Hence my coffee always tasted burnt. I decided to switch to percolator coffee and was so pleasantly surprised how easy it is to make the coffee and the taste was far superior than the drip. So glad I finally converted to the percolator!!!! You will be very happy with this purchase",

Nothing happened but the water got warm in the bottom of the pot. I\u2019m pretty sad about it too. I like the extra flavor from perking it and also having a actual Hot cup of coffee. I returned it \ud83d\ude41I\u2019m pleased with the fact I only paid 40$ for it. It takes 4 to 5 minutes to brew which is good. I use the disc filters so very little coffee grounds. The flavor of the coffee is good. That\u2019s why I wanted one because I want more flavorful coffee. The stay hot feature could be better because your second cup isn\u2019t warm enough for me. I am concerned about the clear knob on top the lid being plastic because I\u2019ve read some people had theirs crack. I can see how too. That should have been glass. Being cuisnart I expected it to be better made. But it\u2019s light and cheap looking which if you paid full price it makes wonder what you paid 80$ for. So coffee is good in it. But seems poorly made and needs a better stay warm feature.",
