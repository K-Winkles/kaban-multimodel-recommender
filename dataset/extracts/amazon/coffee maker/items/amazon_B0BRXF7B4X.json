I now have this little coffee ritual and although it is psychological, I find as I am going through the motions, my anticipation of a good, smooth cup of coffee is heightened. Kind of weird really, and my daughter laughed when I told her about. Seems almost like the Japanese tea-house rituals without the spiritual aspect. Anyway, takes a little time, but I don't mind waiting for a good thing. The cup itself is very nice and sturdy. It stores well by just setting it on another cup in the back part of the cabinet, and clean up is just a swift rinse and dry. I use the melitta cone filters, #2.",

                "reviewText": "I love this simple pourover coffee maker. It looks great, and the word \"coffee\" printed on one side stops it from being too plain. From a practical standpoint, it's great because it holds a #2 cone paper filter perfectly. No sludge gets in the bottom of the cup! It has three fairly big holes in the bottom for the brewed coffee to come out, so I don't have to wait forever to get my completed coffee. It's pretty sweet, especially at its very affordable price.",

The device takes the same #2 paper cone filters that I have always used, and is easy to clean. Hopefully it will prove to be sturdy--it looks like solid construction. Of course, one needs to heat water separately, so all-in-all the labor involved is about the same as before.",
