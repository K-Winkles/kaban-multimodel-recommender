The carafe in particular was difficult to clean because we simply don't do it often enough.I was going to run some citric acid through the coffee maker and thought this might be a good time to clean the carafe and our thermos bottles. It worked very well on both of them!The only downside is that I had to use almost the whole bottle in one pass, so it's a bit expensive. I think I'll keep buying it though since it does do a tremendous job of cleaning up coffee stains.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 12C drip brewer so this required the entire bottle when used according to instructions. Note that I did not follow the instructions on the Amazon page. I put the cleaner in the pot and filled to the top with hot tap water and let it set about 45 minutes. The result was that most of the staining was removed and I was able to remove the rest by brushing lightly with a bottle brush.I'm entirely satisfied with the results but at this cost I probably won;t be using the product often.",

                "reviewText": "My stainless steel coffee thermal carafe is over 20 years old and had never been cleaned with anything other than warm soapy water. After that amount of time and 1000's of uses, the carafe was completely coated with coffee oils and stains and was darker than my darkest brew in the dead of a moonless night.Scrubbing with dish soap and hot water wouldn't touch that mess, nor would the normal cleaners used to descale and clean my coffee maker. So, I decided to try this. After adding the recommended amount of this cleaner to the carafe and then filling it to the brim with boiling water, I let it \"steep\" for 1/2 hour. When I dumped the cleaning solution it was darker than my morning coffee and, after the lightest of scrubs , the inside of the carafe was as bright and shiny as the day I purchased it. Using this was easy and the results were perfect. Yes, it's pricy but it 100% delivered what it promised, and for me that earns 5 stars.",
