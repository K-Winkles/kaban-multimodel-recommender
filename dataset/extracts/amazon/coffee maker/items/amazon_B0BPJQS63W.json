A brewer that performs within the ideal ranges of the four T\u2019s produces the perfect ratio of coffee flavor compounds extracted into water, which the SCA refers to as \u201cthe golden cup.\u201d That ratio creates the flavors we enjoy when we sit back with a good cup of coffee, and every Moccamaster hits that mark every brew cycle. The Coffee Brewer for Coffee Lovers Since 1968, Moccamaster coffee brewers have set the global benchmark for at-home coffee brewing. Designed to extract the maximum flavor from your grounds in about 4-6 minutes, coffee from a Moccamaster is comparable to what you would brew using a more complex manual process or drink in a caf\u00e9. We build our coffee brewers to last, using only the highest quality materials and offering replacement parts. With proper care and maintenance, this should be the last coffee brewer you ever need to buy. Moccamaster coffee brewers are handmade in heart of the Netherlands. Our brewers have a durable metal housing and use a copper boiling element to heat the water, which allows for consistent water temperature control. All plastics are BPA, BPS, BPF, and phthalate-free. We individually test every brewer before it leaves our factory.",

                "reviewText": "I've only had this coffee maker a week, so take what you can from that. But, so far, so good! Easy to set-up. Within 2 days I had the coffee adjusted to where I like it far as taste goes. Performs flawlessly, is quiet, fast, looks good and the coffee is not only flavorful, but HOT. I really like that about it. I'm used to pre-heating my coffee cup so the coffee doesn't cool off too fast, but not even sure that's necessary with this coffee maker. It is the perfect temp to brew good coffee and keep it hot all the way to the bottom of the mug. It's easy to clean and I love the \"retro\" look. The genius is in its simplicity...easy to adjust for any type of coffee you like. Zero issues or complaints...I'll come back and add if I need to, but love it so far.UPDATE. I've had this coffee maker for a little over a month now. I love it more now, than I did when I first got it. It continues to amaze me how good the coffee is! It has to make the smoothest coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I even bought a grinder. I went into it not expecting much of a difference, but boy was I wrong. The coffee is even more flavorful! I\"m thinking of buying a second one, just to have on hand, in case something goes wrong in the future, but since you can purchase most or all of the parts you might need, not really necessary.",

                "reviewText": "I love coffee. My wife loves coffee. And over the years we\u2019ve tried to love many, perhaps dozens of coffee makers. The cuisinart grind n\u2019 brew, the oxo smart pour over. Mr coffee, Hamilton beech more cuisinart. Vac pots, French presses the list goes on. We didn\u2019t discriminate. Some were ok for a while. Some awful right away. None lasted very long (and 3 weeks in the longevity jury is out on the Moca master too) the last 4 or 5 machines, I already had my eye on the moccamaster, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to cross the 300USD rubicon on a coffee machine. How good could it be really right? After our last machine died at the beginning of April (the entirely mediocre Cuisineart pour over) we went for it. An orange Mocamaster KVBG. There\u2019s no going back. It\u2019s the best coffee machine I\u2019ve ever had. By a wide margin. 1) the coffee is hot. Like really hot. Our last machine didn\u2019t break 180F when brewing. This machine is consistently 201F (we are around 200ft above sea level if that matters to you), it\u2019s also relatedly strong and flavorful. 2) it brews quickly and quietly. The machine brews 10 cups in under 4 minutes it\u2019s less than half the time our prior machine took. 3) the coffee stays really hot: the heating plate is running on its a separate heating element and circuit from the brewer heating element and both are very powerful. Coffee is held around 180 for 2 hours 4) this is one I wouldn\u2019t have thought much about but it\u2019s not unimportant. There is a very limited amount of plastic contacting the hot water or coffee. The heater body is metal. Heating elements are copper, the hoses are silicone and the brew head is stainless steel. The only meaningful contact with plastic is when the hot coffee enters the carafe (the cover is plastic). This is a major improvement over every other machine I\u2019ve ever used. Which had aluminum heating coils inside plastic heater tanks, plastic spray heads etc. 5) the aesthetic. It\u2019s not retro. It never changed. It\u2019s unreformed. It is a big Orange middle finger from the 1970s sitting on your kitchen counter. There is no WiFi. There is no app. There\u2019s not a clock. Simply an on off switch (and a pot size adjuster which may or may not really do anything). I find it refreshing: last year when our washing machine broke it was a struggle to find one that wasn\u2019t internet enabled. Why do I want an internet enable washing machine?So far I couldn\u2019t be happier. Somehow it feels like a good value for the 350USD (as of April 23). If you\u2019re on the fence. I\u2019d go for it. You won\u2019t look back.",

                "reviewText": "Our grind and brew machine died on us and so we started using a French press and/or Areo press. Both options worked fine, but I like to make a pot in the morning so my wife can have a cup, and I can take the rest to work in a thermos.I started watching reviews on drip coffee makers and came across this unit. Everything about it was appealing.-THE LOOK- Aesthetically, it's stunning. Timeless, classic look. It's very clean, the textured finish looks very durable, doesn't finger print, and the color choices are excellent. (I wanted the pistachio color but once I pulled the trigger couldn't wait for it to be shipped so opted for my second choice). While brewing it looks neat as the water bubbles up the center column and into the outlet.-THE BREWING OPTIONS- Very basic controls, but the half pot select allows you to not only brew a half pot, but modifies blooming duration. From there the sky is the limit with grind options and strength without all the buttons and programming. It's also pretty fast- full pot in 6 minutes.-THE TASTE- I've had it 5 days and have made 7-8 pots... It's the best tasting coffee (obviously the beans, grind and everything can make the difference... but when I have a Tim Hortons or Starbucks it's just not the same) and I drink black coffee.-THE DESIGN- If it ain't broke... this design has been around for 50 years and is hand made in the Netherlands and comes with a 5 year warranty. It's not ground breaking but that's the point. Keep it simple. Quality parts, copper heating element, and separate elements for water heating and the carafe. The removable water outlet arm is a nice touch if it gets a fingerprint on it or if your need to clean- simply pop off.-THE PRICE- Ok, so this is super expensive for \"just a coffee brewer\" but personally I'd rather spend big money on a quality piece that has service able parts, rather than a machine 1/3 the price that may only last 2-4 years. This is a lifetime machine if cared for. Personally I drink at least 3 large black coffees/ day. Starbucks dark roast black is $4.00 CAD. It'll pay for itself in no time.-THE ONLY NEGATIVE- The glass carafe seems really fragile and thin. I'm paranoid it will break. I do not allow anyone to operate my machine as I'm scared they wouldn't be as careful as I when I rinse it.So if you buy pre ground coffee and want an easy pot of coffee, or like to grind fresh and experiment in grams per liter, ground size etc... but must have the best- buy this.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to use, easy to clean and makes great hot coffee very rapidly. We enjoy the simplicity of the unit, it's all optimized to deliver great tasting hot coffee, so no need for various nobs that we would never use in any case. We also appreciate the absence of a clock which in many other coffee makers only servers to add un-needed light to the kitchen. We make coffee every morning for two (with 2 regular cups each) in under 5 minutes. For 4 or more people, you'll probably need to make two pots. A consideration if you need large volumes of coffee on a regular basis. The makers have put a lot of attention to many details to the coffee maker including reducing the noise it generates (although it make coffee very rapidly, this is the most quiet brewing machine that we have ever seen). The absence of styrofoam in the environmenally friendly packaging was also nice to see. Yes it is expensive but it's a great machine with a 5 year garantee that we have found is well worth the cost for a great cup of coffee.",
