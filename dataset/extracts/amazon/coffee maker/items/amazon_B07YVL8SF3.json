                "reviewText": "It's been three years since I bought this Aeropress, almost to the day. Happy Anniversary, beautiful! I love you and I can't imagine my life without you \ud83d\ude05 Sorry, I drifted there for a second \ud83d\ude02Before Aeropress, I used a French press. It was part of my morning rituals: grind the beans, boil the water, pour and let it sit, press, and voil\u00e0, you got coffee. I enjoyed that. What I didn't enjoy, though, was the sediment and the cleanup! Enter, Aeropress \ud83e\udd29Pros \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d- Compact and portable.- Consistently good coffee, every time (once you've dialed it in to your preferences).- Easy to use. Personally, I use the inverted method.- Easy to clean. You end up with a neat little puck. Toss, rinse and repeat!- Economical: minimum waste in paper, coffee, time, and energy!- Lasts for ever! See photos of mine, three years later, of almost daily use.- S, M and XL: Aeropress now comes in your choice of small (Go), medium (Original), and even XL!Cons \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e- Honestly, not much to complain about. This invention is near perfect!- OK, the paper filter holder is just too small to be useful!- Also, I wish the Aeropress logo was embossed and not just printed, but this is nitpick territory!My Verdict \ud83e\uddd0My first reaction to using my Aeropress was that this is the best thing that\u2019s happened to coffee since 1852 (the year the first French Press was patented). I love mine, and I'm sure you will fall in love with yours. Trust me, you need this in your life!One more thing: If I have to buy it again, I would certainly go with the Original Aeropress. I honestly think it's just as compact and travel-friendly. Besides, I don't care for any of the other accessories, like the cup or the foldable stirrer!I hope my review has helped you make a more informed buying decision \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ufe0f",
