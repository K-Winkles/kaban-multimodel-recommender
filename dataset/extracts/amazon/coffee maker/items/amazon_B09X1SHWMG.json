It brews quickly, which is nice.Note: the brewer will signal a descaling mode from time to time.This is a maintenance feature, don't freak out, your machine isn't malfuntioning, it is meant to do this to keep it clean and running smoothly. Read the instructions. If you want your machine to last, don't use tap water.I did have an issue with my machine and reached out to Mecity.I am very impressed because they responded to me in less than 24 hours.They honored their warranty, and I am very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I received this single cup coffee maker about a month ago. Let me say, after using it every day since then, that it is just perfect for a single person. I make 2 cups of coffee every day, at least. I usually use the largest cup setting, which is 12 oz! I have read reviews that they don't have a cup that fits into the space it should go. That is a little bit different than a Kurig. It's not true that a regular sized coffe cup doesn't fit there. However, a thermos type cup will not work. This taller cup I have is the only one that works on the largest cup setting. The medium cup setting dispenses about 9 oz. The smallest cup setting dispenses a little more than 7 oz. The coffee is hot at 168 degrees. It comes with a holder for single kurig type pods but it also takes pods which have an indentation in the middle of the bottom if the pods. The piercing needle is on the side instead if the middle. It comes with a super holder for tea leaves and 2 holders for you own ground coffee. I found the coffee was not strong enough for my liking using my own grounds, even dark roast. Perhaps I'd like that feature using ground coffee in the tea leaf holder as it's mych deeper. Anyway, I am loving it. If you're a single person like me, I found trying to make a pot of coffee with just enough so I didn't waste it AND it didn't taste burnt by the time I was ready for my second cup just a total pain in the a**. This works!",

The footprint on my counter is much smaller than the Keurig. It make a delicious cup of coffee and is easy to clean. The time it takes to make a 10 oz. cup is longer than the Keurig but it's worth the cost saving on the unit price. It also can use ground coffee and leaf tea as well as k-cups. Highly recommended!",

Easy to set-up, clean, maintain and use!!BUT after 4 months of use it was brewing in accurate size cups, so we descaled according to the instructions. Never made the right size cups again, then a week later it started making snorting noises, then, it melted the K-cup, and now it does not work at all.It was only good for 4 months = ( So if I want to pay 56.00 every four months it's worth it,BUT I do not want to pay $168.00/year. Therefore, this machine is not a good investment!!!",

                "reviewText": "I have gone through two K cup coffee machines in the last month. One was a simple one like this and made nice hot coffee like this. Unfortunately that one took from 80 seconds to 300 seconds to make a cup of coffee depending on the size and it was inaccurate by 2 oz per cup.This one makes nice hot coffee in about 1 min 20seoncds. Temp for 167 to 169F in the cup, and 194F our of the machine (cup cools it down from room temperature). This is key in having i nice hot cup of coffee. Once you press the power button (which is touch sensitive as well as all the buttons) it start brewing right away at a slower pace compared to others. But I like this because you get a stronger better tasting cup of coffee.I like strong coffee and this is just about there (I only use bold coffees like Starbucks Italian & Keurig Sumatra). The reason why I say almost there is this machine actually pours 1oz more of coffee.So 6oz is 7oz, 8oz is 9oz and 10oz is 11oz. For most people this won't be an issue at all.For me it's only a small issue because it makes hotter coffee than my Keurig, and Ninja Duel Brew Pro.I know why did I buy another machine then. I like to change pots just like my wife likes to change curtains, throw pillows etc.It could be the extra ounce is because of the left over in the heater element. This machine doesn't end by blowing air out and the end of the cycle like others do.The bottom line. if you want a really nice looking coffee machine that brews a hot nice cup of coffee in just the right amount of time, then you can't go wrong.Don't let price fool you. You get what you pay for and this one gives you way more for the price of the machine. If you can wait, just ad it to your wish list. I goes on sale from time to time.One last note. It comes with two adapters to use for coffee or tea. Both which hold a fairly good amount of either.Update 9/1/23I used the regular grind coffee filter and adopter and this holds a lot of coffee grinds. This is the first K cup machine where I could use regular grinds and make a strong cup of coffee. In the photo I added it shows the size of a K cup and the filter. Realize that depending on the k cup you could have from half of the k cup size filled with coffee to about 7/8. They are never full. Compare this filter to any other and you will see it's larger than anything else. So if you only want a k cup every once in awhile and prefer ground coffee this is the machine for you. I am amazed how well this machine is performing compared to all my branded machines. A true winner in my book.",
