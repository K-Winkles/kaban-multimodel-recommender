The wringing has caused it to become misshapen, but it gets clean and still works as intended.I give 5 star rating when price:quality:functionality is equal. This product meets that standard.I have a large espresso machine and low hanging cabinets, so while it just barely fits in it's space, it has to be pulled out to refill beans or water. This has been a hassle, because the machine shimmies as you pull it, and water sloshes from the tank.This little mat, with it's cute little drawings, is exactly what I needed to fix that issue. The front of my machine rests on the felt mat, and now I can slide the machine out from under the cabinets effortlessly. The rest of the mat covers in front of the machine, to soak up drips and rest spoons.I'll update review if it does poorly in the washer/dryer once it gets too soiled.",
