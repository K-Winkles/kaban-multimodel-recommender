Why the coffee pod has a small tear or a hole in the bottom mesh\uff1f When put the coffee capsule into the pod adapter, align the indicator mark of the capsule and then put it in. (Do not put the capsule into the pod adapter first and then rotate it to align the hole position. This is the key to capsule damage!\uff09 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Why coffee sprayed everywhere during brewing? When using coffee capsules, the coffee machine's brewing basket and pod adapter need to be put in the coffee machine at the same time to brew normally. If you find that there is an extra coffee brewing basket around your machine, you need to confirm whether you use the coffee machine correctly! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. It didn't fit my dualbrew my coffee maker. This capsule is only compatible with \u2018three hole\u2019 coffee machine(Specialized for CFP series, for example, please pay attention to distinguish CFP301 and CP301, they are completely different!), please confirm your coffee machine model before purchasing! ------------------ All words references to \"ninja\" are intended to describe the compatibility of our coffee pods.

They are sturdy, well made, not cheap, reusable and clean up like a dream. Great value package and I'd buy again, and am giving as stocking stuffers to friends and family who can use them. Well worth buying.",
