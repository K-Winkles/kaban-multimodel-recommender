                "reviewText": "Update July 2023: Still going strong!! Using it daily! I've followed their cleaning guide and decalcification guidelines and have had no issues!Update June 2nd 2019: Still use it daily, and it's working well! It's now been almost 4 years! (Time flies when you're drinking good coffee :)Update August-6-17: Still going strong after almost two years!Original Review and Tips:I love this thing. I've been using it multiple times a day for almost a year I think. Every day it makes amazing espresso, and as long as I keep it clean it preforms beautifully. This thing is also easier to maintain and requires less cleaning than other cheaper espresso machines I've tried.A tip for anyone looking to make actual espresso at home, I recommend looking for a local roastery in your area. I use to buy bulk beans online like many people, but once I tried local whole beans and found a blend I liked, the difference was amazing. Bean choice is very important if you actually want to enjoy your espresso!A few tips I picked up for using this machine:1. A few people complained about the grind amount knob not going low enough. To counteract this, I changed the cup size to \"Single\" and increased the grind amount by turning the knob to the right. This gives me the perfect amount of ground coffee every time.2. If the machine keeps going over or under on the pressure gauge, try cleaning the grinder. And remember to clean the grouphead with those desolvable tablets when the clean me light comes on!3. You can get cheap replacement cleaning tablets here on amazon. I chose Urnex Cafiza Espresso Machine Cleaning Tablets here on amazon, and they work great!4. You do not need to order a separate tamper, the one included is perfect.5. The included frothing cup is small but works for me. Some might need a bigger one.6. Do not underestimate the need for a burr grinder. Trying to make good espresso without one is like trying to hammer a nail with an inflatable hammer!Some of the features I love (Pros)*1) The grinder. I know many would rather use a separate burr grinder, but this thing works perfectly fine, and is easy to clean. Many complained about the coffee machine heating up the beans too much if you leave them inside the hopper, but I actually store my beans in a special container outside of the hopper, and use the included the scoop to pour in the beans when I grind them.2) The frother is amazing. Much much better than cheaper machines.3) Clean me light is awesome. Always reminds me to keep up on this things maintenance, and helps prolong the life.4) The Stainless steel is beautiful. (It is not 100% stainless on the outside though, a little bit of plastic, see cons.)5) The pressure gauge. Absolutely invaluable in making good tasting espresso. I would not recommend buying any machine without one. It really helps with learning and getting it right!6) The included tamper is perfect.7) Creates perfect pucks of coffee to dump out in the trash.8) The hot water dispenser is an awesome addition!9) Is an all-in-one, meaning I don't need to buy a separate grinder!10) Just makes good coffee.11) Great manual included for lots of useful information.12) Has an automated cleaning cycle to clean the insides of the grouphead. Awesome!14) Includes a beautiful copper dosing tool.15) Includes tools to clean out the filters.Some things that bother me (Cons)*1)The top of the machine is plastic.2) The bottom sides of the machine is plastic3) The water tank needs to be refilled often, and it also thick plastic.4) The bottom water catcher thing (sorry) needs to be emptied often, but its not too bad.5) The coffee grind separator doesn't really seem to help much, but it does help keep it out of the water below and little bit, which keeps it from smelling!6) Expensive, but to me, was a very worthwhile investment for how much coffee I was buying from the shop.7) Can't seem to find inexpensive filters for the water tank, however, I use filtered water instead of tap.8) The Lowest grind amount is too much on the \"double\" setting. QC Should have caught this! But not a deal breaker. See above for workaround.*Might add more later as I think of them!This thing is also great for making sweet frappicinos and iced drinks.For caramel flavored drinks I use Hershey's Caramel Syrup (Edit: I now make my own caramel syrup! It's super easy!)For vanilla flavored drinks I use Torani Vanilla Syrup that I get cheaply from a bulk wholesale store in my town.For my sweet drink of choice I mix the two, add a double shot of espresso, 2% milk, and top with whipped cream and caramel syrup.Nothing beats a great espresso in the morning!Added tons of pictures.Edit: It seems quite a few people had problems with the machine dying on them, If your machine died on your please comment on this review with any information you think may help, such as the level of maintenance you preformed while your machine was working, the brand of water filters and cleaning tablets you used, etc.Maybe we can find a common cause of this defect!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this machine. With as many lattes as I drink, this will easily pay for itself within a year, inclouding the cost of beans, milk and cleaning products.Notes: Make sure to keep up with all the regular maintenance. Ever day after I've made my coffee, I wipe the steam wand, purge it, then wipe again. Make sure to get into all the crevices around the tip and you'll never need to use the pin to clean out the tip. Once I've done that and poured my steamed milk, I purge the showerhead by pulling one shot into the empty mug (no filters). This keeps the showerhead clean of coffee debris and keeps the coffee tasting pure.REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR WATER FILTERS. The filters should be changed every 60 uses or 2 months, whichever comes first. This wolill reduce how often you need to descale the machine, prolong it's useful life and provide better tasting coffees. You will still need to descale the machine every so often. The manual included is very helpful for keeping up with the maintenance (as well as pulling shots, making drinks and other useful tips) and you can also find instructions on their website should you misplace the manual. Gold tone makes pretty inexpensive replacement filters specific to this machine and they're available here on Amazon. I use them and am pretty happy with the results.Do not let the water run out. Ever. This could cause serious damage to the machine. If you forget once or twice, you'll probably be just fine but check the water reservoir at least 1-2 times per week.Clean the machine parts at least once a week. You may need to empty and rinse the drip tray 1-2 times a week (depending on frequency of use) but take it out and hand wash at least once a week. This is a good time to wash the tools and tool bin as well. Also, dont forget to take the coffee filters out of the portafilter and wash those as well. Over time, residue can build up underneath there. Also, the spouts in the portafiler twist off so you can clean them better. Clean out your parts, get in those crevices regularly and you'll be just fine.Don't forget to clean the hopper and grinder. You should clean it out every time you switch to a new bean or at least every few pounds of coffee. The instructions in the manual are pretty easy and straight forward. I also use a clean, dry towel to wipe any remaining coffee and oils from both the grinder parts and the hopper. Do not wash in warm water as you could risk it not drying well and rusting or not being lubricated enough and over heating. Just use the included brush and clean, dry paper towels. You could also vacuum out residual coffee from the grinder to assist in cleaning, but I don't usually need to.Also, remember that the stainless exterior is stainless plating. This means it can wear over time and not look as nice. The best way to handle this is to wipe it down with a damp cloth (once daily then more detailed once a week) and follow it up by drying it with a clean towel. This will prolong the exterior appearance. Also during your weekly cleaning, be sure to look under where the coffee and steam come out and clean around there. Milk, coffee and residue steam can splatter and build up so be sure to clean it as well.The weekly cleaning sound intensive but really takes maybe 5 minutes.Common issues: Keep in mind certain o-rings will need to be replaced over time. This is noted by Breville in the manual and on the website. There are two main places where you need to replace these: around the tip of the portafilter (where the spouts connect) and where the portafilter connects to pull shots.Another common issue is that the machine will make a loud \"buzzing\" sound and/or leak water out of the bottom of the machine. This is a common issue and, when it does occur, usually happens around 6 months to a year. This generally occurs due to a broken solenoid valve. If your product is still under warranty, take a video and contact their customer service. Maybe suggest it's a solenoid valve and they are usually very good about fixing or replacing the machines and parts. If it is no longer under warranty and they will not resolve the issue (because sometimes they still will after the warranty period), there are many repair services that can fix this. If you are especially handy and brave enough to fix it yourself, you can usually find the replacement parts fairly cheaply online (not just the valve, but really ANY part that may need to be replaced). Again, if it's still under warranty do not go this route, as it will void any existing warranty. Also, if you don't know what you're doing, you could do more damage than good.All-in-all, this is an amazing machine for this price point. There is a reason this machine is so popular and highly rated. There's a lot of customization available to you and it is a very good quality machine. I would not suggest any product below this machine and price point for your first machine as you'll likely be very disappointed in the results. Eventually you may want to upgrade to a more robust multi-thousand dollar machine, but this is great for the majority of consumers and is super user friendly. Use higher quality beans directly from the roasters and learn how to use the machine and make drinks and you'll be very happy with it. The quality is truly amazing for such a low cost espresso machine.Side note: Whole Latte Love on YouTube is a great resource for additional reviews, tips and tricks and maintenance for this machine (and many more). It's also a great resource on how to pull shots, steam milk, pick types of milk and make many different types of drinks when you're just starting out or want to up your coffee game.",

                "reviewText": "En general es un equipo bastante disfrutable despu\u00e9s de la curva de aprendizaje que he de decir que no es sencilla para principiantes (ninguna m\u00e1quina decente de espresso lo es).Al ser una maquina de \"Termoblock\" (de temperatura ajustable) equipada con PID, la temperatura del grupo permanecer\u00e1 estable electr\u00f3nicamente, por lo tanto no ser\u00e1 necesario hacer \"flush\" antes de hacer un espresso como en las maquinas equipadas con caldera; el inconveniente de no tener caldera es que no es posible hacer una extracci\u00f3n y cremar leche a la vez, pero al ser un equipo destinado para hogar eso no debe representar problema.La calidad de espresso que entrega el equipo es SOBRESALIENTE si est\u00e1 correctamente calibrada, dando tazas muy equilibradas. Hablando de calibraci\u00f3n, el punto d\u00e9bil de este equipo es precisamente el molino, que a pesar de tener much\u00edsimos ajustes es \"de pasos\", es decir, se tiene que ir de nivel de molido 1 al 2 sucesivamente sin poder usar niveles intermedios lo que al final hace que algunas tazas no queden perfectas pero infinitamente mejor que de cualquier cafeter\u00eda de cadena.Siguiendo con el tema de la calibraci\u00f3n, deben tener en cuenta que el equipo se debe calibrar EN CADA USO (molido y/o tiempo de extracci\u00f3n) a menos que la temperatura y la humedad se mantengan constantes por d\u00edas (lo cual es imposible). He observado algunos \"reviews\" que se quejan que la m\u00e1quina o el man\u00f3metro no funcionan correctamente, el error es \u00a1DEBIDO A LA CALIBRACI\u00d3N!, no es problema de la m\u00e1quina. Cada que se cambia el grano, incluso la misma bolsa pasados d\u00edas se debe re-calibrar.Si quieren facilitar o casi omitir el proceso de calibraci\u00f3n, pueden usar las canastillas presurizadas de doble pared que vienen incluidas con la m\u00e1quina a expensas de la calidad final de la taza.El mantenimiento es extremadamente sencillo pero se debe tomar muy en cuenta y considerar los gastos asociados: Personalmente hago unos cuantos back-flushes cada fin de semana para mantener el grupo limpio y ya que el molino NO ES \"sin retenci\u00f3n\" lo aspiro cada cambio de bolsa para extraer restos de granos y molienda vieja. Tambi\u00e9n eventualmente el LED de Clean/Descale se mantendr\u00e1 encendido o parpadear\u00e1 y se deber\u00e1 proceder a limpiar la ducha con una pastilla (incluida) o descalcificar el sistema con el polvo descalcificador (incluido). Otra cosa a tomar en cuenta es que se debe cambiar el filtro de resina cada 3 meses, pero al usar agua embotellada que es mucho menos dura que la del grifo puedes espaciar el cambio.",

Appreciate the urgency and the extra mile (pun intended) the seller went to help. I am happy with how they supported and resolved the problem.Turns out the machine didn't need a step-down converter since it needed 250V input and India supports it. It only needed a pin converter for an Australian power plug. I went by a review, ordered a step down and ran the machine alongwith it, which is what was giving machine half the power to operate and hence it didn't pump any water. So please check the details of inputs required for the model you order. Fun fact: The input requirements are also embossed on the base of power plug.-----------------------------------------------------------------Old Feedback (26-Dec-23):Having removed all tags and packaging, followed all startup instructions with a step-down converter (for usage in India). After power-on we tried to run water through head, wand and steamer. None of them would dispense water. and there is no customer support available in India.",

                "reviewText": "Between myself and husband we'd spend hundreds at Starbucks every couple months and I'd have a decaf long shot Americano with steamed heavy cream and sometimes even an extra long shot. Super picky about having amazing coffee. Once you go through the learning curve which, with the advice also below, from another amazing customer review, you should get it down in about a couple days total. Once you have it down this coffee flavour and smoothness surpasses the best coffees I've had at Starbucks. Freshly ground coffee is the ultimate winner and it surpasses pre-ground easily so spend the extra moula and get the grinder! Your mouth will thank you :) The machine is amazing and beautiful and easy to operate once you read the instructions and look on you tube as to how to steam cream or milk exactly. You won't regret this coffee, I was using the same beans (Starbucks Espresso Decaf) pre-ground on a routine coffee maker and when put through this machine the flavour is so rich and smooth and it just lingers all over the inside of your mouth all over your tastebuds. Crazy. My mom is European and has had her share of coffees and espressos and I brought her a cup and she said it was the best coffee she's tasted, even better than the few she'd tried at Starbucks. Enjoy!Here's the review below I also used and I purchased those additions he mentioned all at once and it was super helpful and it made the experience so much smoother!1. I am a guy, who knew nothing about espresso machines before this. I am very mechanically inclined and don't usually read instructions. This was different - this machine is NOT self-explanatory and you NEED to read the instructions (which are well written, and even include a troubleshooting section). Don't get frustrated with this machine until/unless you have read (all) the instructions.2. This is not a 'stand-alone' purchase ... this machine costs around $500 (give or take), you need to invest another $100 right from the start (preferably at the same time) to get the most out of it, enjoy it to the fullest, and not get unreasonably frustrated by making your own lattes and mochas.3. The other things you REALLY should order at the same time (and all are available on Amazon) are:a. ($29) 100-pack disposable 20oz. cups with lids and sleeves (sold by Yes!fresh). Trust me, you want to get these. It's only $0.29 per cup and are far more convenient that trying to clean out a million dirty coffee cups from your car/office each week. These are worth twice what they cost in the long run. And when your friends are over, you need not 'loan' them a nice coffee cup to go (which you may never see again) - just give them a paper cup to take with them.b. ($5-15 for 25 oz. / $20-30 for 64 oz.) Torani syrups and sauces, AND the pump tops that go with them (always sold separately). IF you drink the same thing on a regular basis (like I do) such as a white chocolate peppermint mocha, buy the 64 oz. white chocolate sauce and not the smaller 25 oz. bottle.c. ($14) Amazon Basics Cotton Washcloth - 24 pack - grey (the grey matches the espresso machine, but the color doesn't matter). Again, trust me, you want a nicely folded stack of these sitting next to the machine - you will use 1 each time you make espresso, and then it will be dirty and needs to be washed. At my house (3 people using the machine) we bought two 24-packs because we make so much coffee - two 24-packs is not too many for our house (I'm thinking about buying a third pack).d. ($10 for pair of single shot size, $15 for pair of double shot size) Set of double-walled espresso shot glasses. Do NOT buy the rounded ones (ie: Cutehom espresso coffee cups) because they will not pour very well and drip all over the place (down the side) each time - very frustrating. Buy the JoyJolt Javaah Double Walled Espresso Glasses instead - you'll be glad you did in the long run. And, if you're planning to make mostly double-shot lattes/mochas, buy a set of Dragon Glassware 6 oz Espresso Cups (also double-walled) so that you don't have to keep fidgeting with the single shot cups to keep them in the right spot under the coffee dispenser. It's important to buy double-walled glasses for two reasons. First, it keeps the espresso hot while you're steaming your milk, second, it keeps you from burning your fingers when pouring the espresso into your coffee cup.e. ($15) Breville BCB100 Barista-Style Coffee Knock Box. Again, TRUST me, you want this right next to your machine - the coffee grounds will start piling up quickly and you don't want your portafilter anywhere near a garbage can. This thing is a must.4. Space requirements: This machine (and all that you want to go with it) will take some counter space - allow AT LEAST 34-inches of counter width to accommodate - slightly more is even better. You will from my picture, this is a 34-inch setup, and there is no room to spare.5. Making espresso. After you read the instructions, here are some tips that they don't include to help avoid frustration:a. When the beans are grinding, lightly knock on the top of the hopper lid (just like knocking on a door) so that the beans keep feeding down to the grinder (sometimes they get hung up - a light knock each time keeps this from happening). Do NOT overfill the portafilter (after tamping) or it will jam coffee grounds into the water outlet and could possibly damage the portafilter or locking guide. After the grounds are tamped down in the filter cup, the silver part of the tamper should be just hidden beneath the rim of the portafilter (the machine includes a tool you can use if you accidentally overfill the filter cup, but after a short while, you'll figure out how much to grind each time and the tool will not be necessary).b. You ALWAYS want to watch the pressure gauge when making espresso. It NEEDS to be in the dark grey area of the pressure gauge (and ideally in/near the middle of the grey area) during the brew cycle, otherwise you are not making good espresso - rather, you are making either watered down espresso (not enough pressure) or not enough espresso which is too rich (too much pressure). There are two key things that affect pressure: the fineness at which the coffee is ground (which is adjustable) and the volume of grounds in the portafilter (also adjustable). Although there is a one or two shot size setting, I have found it best to do two, 1-shot grinds, tamping down the grounds in-between each single-shot grind. I have the grind (volume) setting on the 4th click setting, and I have the grind (fineness) setting on either 2 or 3 (play around and see what gives you the best results). IF the pressure is too low, then either your coffee is ground too coarsely, or your have not tamped it down tight enough, or the filter is not filled with enough coffee grounds, or a combination of any/all of these things. IF the pressure is too high, then either your coffee is ground too finely, or you have tamped down the grounds too hard (tightly), or a combination of the two.c. IF using two, single-shot espresso glasses to collect a double-shot brew, keep an eye on them during the brew cycle and make sure they are centered under the espresso being dispensed (this can be avoided by using a double-shot size collection cup).d. IF making a mocha or other syrup/sauce drink, pre-mix the espresso and syrup in the glass and stir thoroughly before adding the steamed milk.e. Steaming milk is 1/2-art, and 1/2-science (seriously), and it does not come naturally. If you've never worked at a coffee shop and been trained to steam milk, do yourself a favor and watch a few good (short) YouTube videos on the proper way to steam milk. You will THANK yourself for taking 5-10 minutes on You Tube and learning the proper way to steam milk (and things to avoid). Understanding the steaming process will allow you to control the amount of foam on top and not make big mess.f. Before you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand to remove the residual water from the boiler line (you don't want a few teaspoons of water in your milk). Vent the line, then turn the steam off ... wait 5 full seconds ... then insert the steam wand into the milk, then turn the steam back on. Hold the handle with your left hand, and place your right hand underneath the stainless steel milk steaming cup, when the cup is too hot for your right hand to touch (I mean really to hot to hold), keep the steam wand in and start counting along with the pump (which sounds like a metronome in the background ... dit ... dit ... dit ... dit ...). For a semi-hot latte/mocha keep the steam wand in the milk for 30 double-dits (don't start counting until after you can non longer touch the bottom with your right hand ... \"and-one, and two, and three\" and so on until you get to 30 (the equivalent of 60 single dits). For hot (but still drinkable) count to 40 double-dits, and for very-hot, 50 double-dits. Anything above 60 and you risk burning the milk (which will ruin the flavor and you will need to toss it out and start over). When finished, turn the steam off, and remove the steam wand from the milk about 3-5 seconds before it finishes blowing steam (to avoid having milk sucked back up into the steam line).g. After you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand again to remove any milk that inadvertently got sucked up into the steam wand line and prevent any from making its way into the boiler. IF milk makes its way back into the boiler unit (because you failed to vent the line after use) you will DESTROY the boiler (permanently), in that, the milk cannot be cleaned out, will burn during the next use, and every cup of milk you steam in the future will have a burnt-milk smell/flavor - yuck! DO yourself a favor and vent the steam line religiously after each use - and make sure others who use your machine know that they can ruin it if they don't do so also! (there goes $500!)h. The bottom tray is easy to remove, empty and clean (comes apart in 3 pieces). You should empty this every 2-4 days of use because it fills up despite you not pouring liquid into it - reason is, each time you finish using the steam wand or hot water dispenser, the machine auto-vents out the line from the boiler into the bottom tray (sneaky little devil) ... so even though you don't realize it, it's filling up a little with each use. (Fun fact - the hot water dispenser can be used for instant hot water to make tea!).",

Je l'ai achet\u00e9 sous la marque SAGE (anglaise) sur la page anglaise d'amazon (3 fois moins cher environ 600\u20ac).Ce modele est fabriqu\u00e9 par Br\u00e9ville en Australie et vendu en Australie et USA sous la marque Br\u00e9ville (1600\u20ac), BARISTA en France (environ 800\u20ac) et SAGE en Angleterre (600\u20ac). Le r\u00e9glage manuel de la mouture ainsi que de la quantit\u00e9 \u00e0 moudre permet un ajustement parfait en fonction des type de caf\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9. la machine est tres lourde et donc tres stable. le systeme de la buse pour le lait permet une mousse adapt\u00e9e et oncteuse en fonction si l'on souhaite un latt\u00e9 ou un capuccino. le r\u00e9servoir de deux litres est simple \u00e0 remplir, et contient un filtrer pour prot\u00e9ger la pompe. Mais j'utilise une carafe brita pour filtrer encore plus l'eau. Apres deux mois d'utilisation intense, rien \u00e0 redire et le voyant pour faire le nettoyage du calcaire (via les pastilles fourni avec tout un kit de filtres une ou deux personnes) ne s'est toujours pas allum\u00e9, donc peu d'entretient \u00e0 faire. La qualit\u00e9 du metal est juste excellente. Bref, mon r\u00eave dans ma cuisine. Comme c'est un model destin\u00e9 au march\u00e9 Anglais (au travers de la marque SAGE) j'utilise donc un petit adapteur (5\u20ac) pour le brancher sur ma prise francaise. Le model BARISTA pour la france est bien \u00e9videmment fournit avec une prise Francaise. Je recommande \u00e0 tout amateur de bon caf\u00e9. Avec des grains de caf\u00e9 100% Carte noir je regle la finesse de la mouture sur 6 pour pour avoir l'indicateur de pression dans la bonne zone (via l'aiguille donc) et 5 avec des grains Illy. Entretient hyper simple. Je suis amoureux.",
