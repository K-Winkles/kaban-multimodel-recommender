                "reviewText": "I read other reviews with complaints about water leaking all over the counter. The filter holder needs to be placed with the tab to the back, seated properly. If a guest were to make the coffee, it is not obvious to do that. I only noticed due to having a leak issue on first run and closely looked at the holder...under bight light and saw tiny print with the instruction. Nowhere in the booklet did it say to do that.The lid was hard to open and close at first but after a couple of uses it is no problem....make sure it snaps in place.The carafe leaves a small amount of coffee in it unless you turn it almost upside down.The carafe is hard to clean the interior with a dish rag due to a narrow opening... I am a woman with thin hands and can barely get my hand holding the rag in it... my husband has to use a bottle brush.With that all said, it is a good little coffee pot for the amount we paid. Coffee tastes good enough (we are not picky about coffee) and it makes about 2 measuring cups of coffee.I cannot speak for longevity since we have only had it about 3 weeks.",

                "reviewText": "It's OK for an inexpensive simple coffee maker with just an on and off switch. There is no automatic shut off, you have to turn it off yourself.Fist time trying it 1/31., I am a bit disappointed... brewing temperature isn't great. Optimal brewing temperature is between 195\u00b0 and 205\u00b0, this doesn't come close. The hot plate doesn't keep the coffee hot, only Luke warm, and when you put in the creamer, the coffee is room temperature (yuk). So, I had to put it in the microwave to get it hot, Inconvenient. So, actually I'm doing double work.The built in filter is a good thing, saves on wasting paper filters. Just be careful when cleaning the filter cup tho, it is flimsy and can puncture easily. The coffee maker does make a rattling sound when brewing, makes me wonder if something is wrong or it could be the arm (issue fixed, it wasnt sitting right.).It puzzles me that the marks are clearly for 5 cups, but I can only make 3 cups... if I try to make 4 cups, during the brewing cycle, the coffee grounds wind up spilling over into the coffee pot and making a mess.I got this because the single serve coffee k-cups are getting too expensive.I'll update again April 30.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second time ordering this particular coffee pot. I'm sure I wore out the first one, which I had for over two years. I used it every day and often two or three times in a day heating water to make tea. This little coffee pot makes the water the perfect temperature for either coffee or tea. I put the tea bags in the pot and turn it on letting the hot water steep the tea bags in the cute little pot. I really like that it heats up fast. It also keeps everything hot while I drink my first cup.Clean-up is easy; I use a vinegar solution of 4:1 water:vinegar and run it through at least two times. I didn't hesitate to order a second pot from the same supplier. I'm just glad they were still available. I like that the pot is glass, and I can see through it to see how much is left inside.There is only an on/off switch. No auto shut off. Also, no timer features to preset for morning coffee. This did not stop me from purchasing as I mentioned above it does not take long to heat up.I think it's a good buy for the money.",
