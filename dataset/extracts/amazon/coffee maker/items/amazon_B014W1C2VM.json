                "reviewText": "I'm writing this after having had brewed a good 100 cups of coffee with it. My history is I had used the old larger version of this. I went through a brewer around 2013, was in the 2yr warranty and got it replaced no charged by cuisinart as the pump wasn't doing well. Then I bought another before they went to the new model currently offered and unfortunately it started to just not handle the new cups, I was getting half cups of what I wanted. So I decided to retire the old coffee maker and saw alot of reviews from people like myself who at first glance probably were not happy with the changes. I loved my old version but as a lot of times happens, the old equipment eventually goes bad and you can't repair them.Out of my own curiosity to what changed with this new version, I took it a step further on my old version to see what was inside the bigger version. The old version had a water tank, it was amber almost like some synthetic plastic/glass with heating elements like an electric water heater. it had to heat up, pressurize and pump. Over time this heat in a tank and plastic parts and let's be honest just ok air pump and water pump it starts to fail over time. I think I got lucky with a good 5 years and probably 2000 cups dispenses. I drink a lot of coffee daily!The new version is a smaller footprint. The tray is much smaller. What is different with this design is the new version has no water storage tank inside, now it runs the water to the k-cup, while that water is getting to the k-cup, it goes through a heating coil. This is much different and hence why it pumps slow and is smaller. I think the cup brew is hotter and better flavor that the old unit. The top cap to press down on the k-cup is improved in my opinion to ensure a tight seal and pump. Engineering seems better for ensuring a good outcome with the cups. I'm ok with that. If that means that there is less scaling and water tank issues and pumps failing this works.Same problems as the other unit with filling larger travel mugs. You have to brew into smaller cup then pour into your travel mug. Not a huge deal to me.The water tank no longer has a blue led light to blink when it's getting low. The tank is different designed, the charcoal spot is different how it seats but I have no idea if it's better or similar. The tank is a little smaller but I probably get 5 large coffee brews before I refill it or I just refill a water cup while it's brewing.So far so good. The warranty experience in past model I had was excellent. I don't know if I'll need it but last time cuisinart took care of a brewer that had failed me. I would expect the same experience should I need it.I'll come back if something changes but so far it's been a good replacement. I don't know if anything will ever be perfect but cuisinart makes a good k-cup brewer. If you are trying to figure out the best k-cup brewer, I can attest to 10+ years of this brand and alot of cups brewed. It's a good machine!",

                "reviewText": "My old simple Keurig died and I intended to replace it with the same model, but coffee makers have evolved so much that I couldn't find a simple one. I did some research and decided on this Cuisinart model. It has a 72 ounce separate water reservoir that can be washed and re-filled instead of having to pour water into the unit every day. The water lasts 3-4 days before I need to refill it. So the operation for getting my cup of coffee is simple: 1. Add K-cup; 2. Close lid; and 3. Push BREW. I have already pre-selected the size of my cup (12 oz) so that will always be the same until I change it. It starts brewing immediately and is done in just 2-3 minutes. There is a setting for Hotter, but I like it the temperature to drink right away. If I wanted to use a travel mug the grill comes off easily accommodate the taller size. Then I might use the Hotter setting for that. It shuts itself off and can be programmed to start at a given time. I love everything about this coffee maker, which was cheaper than comparable models of other brands. I have other Cuisinart appliances and I've never been disappointed.Update: The first couple of days using this coffee maker was great. I brewed my cup and then immediately brewed another cup. Since then, it is problematic to brew that second cup. I have tried turning it off for awhile, opening and shutting the lid, pushing cup size buttons, noting it does have plenty of water, but nothing works except just waiting for 5-10 minutes when it will eventually be ready to brew. This is most annoying. Once it wouldn't even brew my first cup, so I hope that won't be a regular issue.",

This was highly rated and alot of good reviews. Ordered and arrived same day. Takes a min to figure out but works great. The coffee ground canister is great and filters fine ground coffee, which other brand wouldn't. Flavor is great and will make a HOT cup of coffee.",

                "reviewText": "Overall love this coffee maker. Pros: easy to use, fast, don't need to use k-cup pods (which are bad for the environment), and when you use the extra hot setting coffee is perfect. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it's hard to clean out the lid of the plastic holder that the mesh grind-holder sits in. The mesh grind holder is easy to clean and seems well-made, but the plastic holder has a really flimsy top (which feels like it's about to snap off every time I wash it), and is really hard to clean because there is a raised ridge on the inside cover that gets coffee grinds stuck in it every time. If that could be fixed I would give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "So I got this yesterday and used it 3 times already into this morning. After years of overnight brewing, straining it in the morning, then microwave it to get it hot, then washing the Mason jars and lids, and the filters I had enough. I did it that way because of my acid sensitive stomach so I was worried if doing it this new way would upset my stomach. It did not \ud83d\ude0a. Anyway I decided to change it up for something faster. THIS coffee maker is very nice. The coffee comes out very hot and quick, and this machine is much quiter than a dang microwave and the beeping beeping when done. Cuisinart made a good machine. Also cheaper than a Kuerig. Now the best part IS, it comes with a reusable cup and filter which makes this environmentally friendly because I don't like those k-cups with their bad aluminum tops and plastic. If you want a nice quick and quiet, inexpensive machine, I highly recommend this one. The blue light makes it look nice too.",

This thing makes perfect coffee and the exact amount specified every single time and it's the first thing I race to in the morning. Easy to use, easy to clean and great tasting coffee. Oh yeah, the K-cups ALL fit easily in this thing (unlike the Kxexuxrixg model I had which wouldn't take some K-cups)",

The rinse button works great after making many cups of coffee and the hot water runs clear to make just hot water. It's louder and slower than the keurig BUT, it's making a much better cup of coffee. I hope to update in 6 months and still be happy",

The positive is that the water is hot instantly so you\u2019re not waiting for it to heat. So far love it.",
