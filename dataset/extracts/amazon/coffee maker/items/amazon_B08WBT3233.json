                "reviewText": "Have had the Elite Gourmet Coffee pot for slightly over 1 year. Overall it\u2019s been a pretty decent coffee pot. The main complaints I have after one year of use, as others have noted: 1) it drips a lot when you pull coffee pot off the base to poor coffee while it is still making. I bought this coffee pot specifically for the pause & serve feature, but unfortunately many times it does not pause as suggested, it still drips coffee quite a bit, which is frustrating. 2) And lately, the most frustrating thing is that the coffee making process has become extremely slower to make a pot of coffee! The past month or so it takes around 20 to 25 minutes start to finish to make a pot of coffee, which seems extremely slow and much longer than it should take! Also I have noticed after initially turning on the coffee pot to start making coffee, the water/coffee will trickle barely into the pot, then it will stop for a minute as if the coffee pot has to think about making the coffee. Then it will start trickling the coffee again, then it will stop & start off and on for the next 25 minutes. Almost as if the filter where the water/coffee drips into the pot is clogged, not sure. I just called elite gourmet support and they had not heard of this issue, but buyer beware, the coffee pot seems to get gradually slower and also drips too much with use/time. Otherwise it makes good coffee and I have no complaints about the quality of the coffee.",

                "reviewText": "Coffee tastes very good. For the price it is great. Have been using it a few weeks now, and so far, using the \"sneak a cup\" feature does not cause the coffee to drip on the heat plate. It is very difficult to find a smaller size coffee maker.I kept my old, name brand maker way too long, for about 2 years, it really leaked and cost more than twice this new one. I purchased and returned the newer model of my current maker. I never cut the plastic off of it. I read through the user manual and there were so many do's and don'ts, it gave me a headache.Way too complicated. This new maker is coffee, water, turn on.When I looked at the beat up, old pot, and this new pot, I decided that for the price, I could afford to get a new one every year (if necessary.)Note these cons:Automatic turn off does not work.Lid is attached to the pot, making pot harder to clean.The pot leaking..not exactly a leak. The lid is NOT designed to fit the pot. Pour REALLY slow, to avoid drip.These are not deal breakers for me. I would buy this coffee maker again.",

I chose this lesser known brand (at least to me) based on the great reviews,. It did not disappoint! It's a small but solid coffee maker. the carafe fits snuggly and the pause to pour works well - no drippy mess. It comes with a reusable basket which is great because it's much smaller than the standard filters. It keeps the coffee really hot for 2 hours. 5 cups is exactly enough for 2 14 oz mugs, Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a reasonable value. I've seen them for less, but everything is inflated in price right now.First things first, this is a 2-cup coffee maker, not 5. We're not measuring for baking ingredients precision here, we're measuring for the coffee cups that we all drink out of.One standout, is that the keep-warm plate/surface is just the right temperature. I've had coffee machines that had a warming plate that was too hot, and it would either burn the coffee or just evaporate everything within a couple hours.There are a couple annoyances with this.When you open the lid, there's condensation underneath, and if you open at a 90degree angle, it slides down and follows along the _outside_ at the back of the machine, getting onto the table or whatever surface it's standing on.It's not hard, but slightly tricky to pour the water in, with the flap up, as there's not much margin for error in there.When you first pour, the hot steam pushes out the back, onto you place your thumb to hold it the caraffe. This is a design flaw. There's not enough to cause any serious burns, but it does give a burning sensation. It's steam after all.I don't use this to actually make coffee in the filter. That grows a certain type of bacteria in the plastic of the basket, which gives the coffee from all machines an acrid taste after a year, and no amount of washing can get rid of it.I just use it to boil water, and keep it hot. I make either instant coffee or tea with it. It's an inexpensive alternative to those very expensive tea kettles that keep your water warm.",
