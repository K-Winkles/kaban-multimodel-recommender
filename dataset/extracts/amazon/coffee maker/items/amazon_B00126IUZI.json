                "reviewText": "Bought these filters for my Cuisinart 14 Cup Coffee Machine. I have been buying the white filters but the prices for them went up substantially at time of this purchase so I decided to try the Natural Brown filters. No difference noted. Some reviewers mentioned a slight taste. I used dark fine grind coffee for my coffee machine and noticed no taste at all. The price was right and no difference between white or natural brown for me.",
