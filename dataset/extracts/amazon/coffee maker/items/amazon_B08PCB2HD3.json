The coffee came out at about 150 degrees which is not that great. This unit makes darn good coffee and it is HOT and stays hot for all twelve cups. Very simple machine, with no frills or difficult programming, just off and on. You have only a couple of choices, time delay and coffee strength, that's it, which is all one really needs. As far as quality, this unit is not built that great, a bit flimsy BUT it works well and makes good coffee. And, for the price, who can complain?Update; It is advertised as a 12 cup but it is not. I measured and the pot only holds about 10 cups. Not big deal but it is not 12 cups.",

                "reviewText": "My old coffee maker died after about 30 years. I researched Mr Coffee and the reviews said quality had gone downhill. So I looked at this Black and Decker unit instead.I have used this at least 50 times since I bought it so I would say that I am pretty familiar with it. Here\u2019s my review:- it\u2019s fine- it brews coffee quickly- it has an automatic timer and turns off if you forget and leave it on the burner- it is kind of loud, but that\u2019s OK- when you first start using it, the basket is a bit quirky, and a couple of times I did it wrong where the coffee didn\u2019t drain properly and I got grounds in the drink. But after a while you learn to just double check it after you put the filter paper and coffee in and you can kind of feel a \u201cclick\u201d when you align it properly and shut the top. But it is possible to put the basket in the wrong way I know it because I did it a couple times- it has the \u201csneak a cup\u201d function, meaning you can get a cup while it is still brewing. That\u2019s cool, I use it a lot. However, a minor problem is that one drop always spills when you do it (not a lot, just one drop) because when you take the carafe off from under the basket and the connection is lost it just always drops one drop that sizzles on the burner. Not a giant deal, just a minor thing that bugs me every day a little bitSo it is definitely worth the money, and works fine. Coffee tastes good, it is fast, and it has automatic shut off. Works great for me. And it is very cheap for what it does. If it dies in a couple years (which I expect), I will just go on the forums again and find another one that is best rated at the time (and cheap) or just re buy this one.",

                "reviewText": "Simple to use, great quality coffee making. It was easy to set up and program. I'm very happy with it overall, my only complaint is that it doesn't keep the coffee hot for very long at all, which is a disappointment. The strong brew function works very well, and I'm happy with my selection. We needed a new coffee maker and this was economical and a great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace a version of this coffee maker that was either 20 or 25 years old. I've owned two of the older model and don't know which one I was still using. I wore the plastic cover off the 'Brew' button on it years ago...You couldn't pour coffee out of the old pot (carafe?) without it siphoning up the side of the pot and splattering coffee around the target when it was full. My daughter who has small hands had trouble handling the pot when it was full.Wow! It's amazing when new and improved really is. The pot included with this model looks almost the same but isn't. The handle has been redesigned and my daughter has no problem with it when the pot is full. That surprised me because the handle is actually bigger. The pot itself has been redesigned and coffee can be poured fast without siphoning up the outside of the pot even when it's full. No more coffee splattered around the cup.I like strong black coffee so the 'Strong' option is really nice and produces great coffee. The 'Clean' indicator is a nice feature which reminds me to clean the pot after every 60 brews. It cleans the pot plumbing but misses the outside of the vortex spout (sprinkler?). I now scrub the spout with a brush dipped in vinegar before starting the self cleaning process.I love this coffee maker. I really love the 'Strong' option and not having to be really careful when pouring out of a full pot. Kudos to B&D for the great product improvements.",
