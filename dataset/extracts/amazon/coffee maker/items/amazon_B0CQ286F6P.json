            "Hot and Iced Coffee at the Touch of a Button - While some mornings you prefer an iced coffee, there are colder mornings when a hot cup of coffee sounds great. No matter what your mood is, this single serve coffee maker always delivers a great cup of coffee. Not strong enough? Simply press the \"strong\" button to make the cup stronger or even use the strong setting to save on ground coffee for making a regular coffee.",
            "Fresh, Non-watery Iced Coffee - By pressing the \"OVER ICE\" button, this iced coffee maker brews a strong cup of hot coffee directly on ice so when the ice melts, it's just the right concentration. Pouring regular coffee over ice can leave it tasting watery, and chilling coffee in the fridge takes time and can cause it to oxidize, affecting its flavor.",
            "2-in-1 for K Cups and Ground Coffee: For strong coffee lovers, the coffee machine comes with a large reusable ground filter basket that holds up to 1.1oz of ground coffee, which is three times more coffee than a pod. Meanwhile, this single coffee maker also has the ability to brew pods. When making iced coffee from a pod, be sure to only use a 6 oz.",
            "Multi-Cup Size Available & Removable 30oz Water Reservoir - You can choose to brew 6, 8, 10, 12, or 24 oz of your favorite coffee, tea, or iced beverage, making this 4 cup coffee maker suitable for real coffee lovers or anyone hosting a tea party with friends. 24 oz coffee is always paired with \"STRONG\" mode and a maximum of ground coffee (1.1 oz) is added to ensure the correct coffee concentration and flavor. The large water tank allows you to make 5 cups before needing a water refill.",
            "Instant Heat Up Technology - This single cup coffee maker brews a cup very quickly - from the moment you press the button, to having a piping hot 6 oz cup of coffee in your hands, it's just 90 seconds!",
            "Fits Most Cup Sizes: You can use mugs between 5 to 6.5 inches tall in this hot and cold coffee maker by placing drip tray in its normal position or placing it upside down. However, to fit taller mug, you also can remove the drip tray, but please make sure that the coffee in the mug is not full, otherwise the coffee will be splashed easily when you take off the mug.",
            "Hot Coffee 175\u00b0F or Higher: Water quickly heats to the right temperature, helping to extract flavor and strength from perfectly ground coffee, giving you a great-tasting cup straight or with milk.",
            "Easy to Clean: The built-in descale reminder will notify you to clean the machine by displaying an alternate red light on the \"REGULAR\" and \"STRONG\" buttons. You can then press these 2 buttons at the same time for 2 seconds to start the self-clean process after adding 14 oz. descaling solution. The ground basket is also dishwasher safe.",
            "Memory Function Automatically Brews the Last Cup Size: This smart k-pod coffee maker has a memory function to remember your preferred cup. For example, if you selected an 8 oz cup last time, the next time you turn on the machine, it will automatically and conveniently brew an 8 oz cup so you don't have to select the size each time.",
            "Safe to use: Whenever there is no water or not enough water in the tank or when the top cover is not properly closed, the coffee pod maker will stop working to ensure safety every time you use it."

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This water reservoir, which is detachable and holds 30 ounces of water, is a sensible design decision that makes it simple to fill and clean. It doesn't matter whether I'm in the mood for a single-serve cup of coffee or if I want to prepare up to four or five cups of coffee for a pleasant weekend breakfast; this coffee maker can easily adjust to meet my requirements. Because of this, I am able to experiment with a wide range of coffee alternatives, ranging from the versatility of K-cups to the opulence of beans that have been freshly ground. The capacity of the machine to accept cup sizes ranging from 6 to 24 ounces guarantees that I am able to tailor the strength and amount of my coffee to my own tastes. The ease of the brewing procedure, in conjunction with the speed with which it produces a cup of coffee that is both flawless and satisfying, is a wonderful match for my hectic mornings. By providing customers with the choice to choose between hot and iced coffee, a layer of adaptability is added that allows them to accommodate a variety of weather and mood situations.",

I love it. I like that it has a removable water container. I also like that the grounds basket was big enough to make 4 cups. The coffee is brewed to a nice hot temp. The coffee basket is very hard to open the first time.",

The latch that holds down the lid will not open with a reasonable effort. Watching a review video, this wasn't an issue for them, it was easily opened, but noted another written review that had the same problem I have. The hinge that holds the lid is extremely flimsy and broke off once the basket was opened. I don't know if it can be operated in this condition or not, and don't have time to contact customer service right now. Will update once I get some sort of resolution. This was a fulfillment by Amazon product, so I'll try them first before contacting the seller.",

It's perfect and takes little space. not sure if it\u2019s malfunctioning or if it\u2019s just gonna be a big giant mess to always have a cuppa coffee. That is the reason I got rid of my Keurig. I\u2019ve tried different size cups and it\u2019s still splashes. It\u2019s a little annoying. but it\u2019s not real hot. The one thing I don\u2019t like about it is the reservoir the lid does not seal correctly/there are small gaps. Aside from a few minor pain in the booty things it really is cute. Some people said it\u2019s hard to push down on the lid or the where you put the coffee. But I do not have that problem. Hopefully I can contact the seller.",

Several different brewing sizes (6, 8, 10, 12 & 24 oz), with regular or strong brewing.. plus over ice brewing as well.. it also has a water reservoir on the back which is super convenient for a quick cup!even has a couple of beeps for when your coffee is done! LOVE THIS!!! I just ordered an extra filter pod so I can have one always ready to go with my own roasted coffee! Great! Great! Great!",
