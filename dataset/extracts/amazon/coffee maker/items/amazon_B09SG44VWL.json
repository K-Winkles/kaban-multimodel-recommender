Don't even need to set the timer, just fill it for the morning brew, hit start, it's hot and ready about ten minutes later as he's heading out the door. Hubby likes his coffee less hot, got him a double-walled mug to take with him. He laughed the first day because his coffee was still scalding hot even after 4 hours. He puts a few ice cubes in now.Anyways, it's a great coffee pot! Works well! It brews hot, doesn't rely on the heating element to heat up the coffee, it actually comes out hot. We are really enjoying the coffee smell in our house, and of course are saving money and time. Definitely get this one! Can't believe we haven't had an actual coffee pot in years.

                "reviewText": "Arrived promptly, the most important thing of course is that it makes a good cup of coffee. I like that it included the reusable filter so I didn\u2019t have to buy that separately. It looks good, has lots of shiny chrome on the front - so shiny it\u2019s actually hard for me to read the button labels, but that\u2019s ok once I get used to knowing what they say. It has a small footprint which is very good in my small kitchen with limited counter space. The downsides are I\u2019ll have to buy replacements for the little charcoal filters, but they\u2019re not too pricey; it\u2019s tall and the water reservoir is built in so I have to scooch it out from under the cabinet to lift the lid to make coffee; the carafe leaks a little water right at the end when I use it to pour into the reservoir; it beeps three loudish beeps when the coffee\u2019s done and I don\u2019t see a way to turn that sound off. My biggest concern is the inside stays damp after brewing unless I prop open the lid (I use a table knife across the top to hold the lid slightly open so the water can evaporate - otherwise I\u2019m pretty sure it would get moldy. Overall I\u2019m happy with it.",

Too much environmental effects.I asked for a drip coffee maker for Christmas and my husband bought me this one.I've been using it for almost a month and I love it.The program timer is great. My coffee is ready at 6AM.I've been grinding my own beans and the freshness compared to the K cup is very noticeable.It's easy to clean. Easy to set up. And the red color looks great in my kitchen.I would recommend this coffee maker.",

However, there is one item that has been mentioned in other reviews and I have to agree, which, if I could give it a 4.5, I would. Manufacturer needs to redesign how the water goes into the maker...extremely small area and it is somewhat difficult to put the water into the \"tank\", especially when the maker is at an angle not conducive to that task.",
