Our Original Blend Single-Serve Coffee Pods are compatible with Keurig coffee makers, which means you can fill your mug whenever the mood strikes. Just pop a capsule in, and seconds later you can customize your cup. Drink it black, with milk, or add two creams and two sugars to make our signature \u201cDouble Double\u201d at home. If you\u2019re feeling like having something sweet and creamy, simply add flavored syrup or whipped cream for a caf\u00e9-style creation. We roast our own beans to ensure your coffee will taste the same cup after cup. Tim Hortons is happy to serve you coffee with care, from bean to cup and invite you to share our sentiment of positivity and togetherness with your community. In 1964, celebrated hockey legend Tim Horton opened our first coffee shop in a small town in Canada, serving our \u201cAlways Fresh\u201d premium coffee blends to coffee-loving Canadians. Today Tim\u2019s vision of creating a place where everyone was welcome to come in and enjoy a cup of coffee has spread to locations throughout Canada, the U.S., and now, the world. We are proud to serve you an amazing cup of coffee whether you enjoy it as your morning wakeup call or as an afternoon pick-me-up, from home, or from one of our worldwide locations.",
