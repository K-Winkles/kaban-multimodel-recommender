                "reviewText": "We are coffee drinkers - gotta have it first thing in the morning. After many years we got really tired of waiting 10-12 minutes for a pot of coffee to brew, and started looking around for one that could brew faster. We found reviews for the Bunn Velocity and decided to try it. Success! This baby makes a full 10-cup pot of hot coffee in 3 minutes flat, and partial pots even faster. I like my coffee strong and my hubby likes it medium (weak lol) so we each make ourselves about a half pot and it works out great. (we have extra carafes because this isn't out first Bunn) The flavor is good, not weak - guess this is because it keeps a reservoir of hot water at all times.It's easy to use once you **read the instructions**; just set the carafe on the warmer BEFORE you close the lid where you put the water in. And buy the Bunn brand filters - other brands are mostly not quite tall enough and can overflow. A few other reviewers mention the basket overflowing if the coffee is ground too fine but we've never had any issues with that; we've always just used regular medium roast ground coffee from the grocery.Cleaning any coffee maker can be a chore, but this one's not too labor intensive unless you need to deep clean it for storage. We have naturally soft tap water so it doesn't get much sediment buildup, but I still run the coil thingy through about once a month.This is our 4th one in about 15 years. After 5 years, our last one was still making coffee just fine, but the warmer plate switch quit working. This happened to our first one as well.Overall a great fast-brewing coffee maker. We will definitely keep buying them until Bunn (heaven forbid!) stops making them.",

This brews the best tasting coffee I\u2019ve ever made. Yes, it\u2019s pricey but so well worth it! Set up is super simple. The coffee is brewed in 4 minutes and is really hot. If you are on the fence about buying this, just do it. You can always return it but I bet you won\u2019t.",

                "reviewText": "Best coffee pot I\u2019ve ever owned. I read a ton of reviews. Decided to order in spite of them. The two legitimate issues people have mentioned (disregarding the ones who simply don\u2019t understand how it works, FYI if you read the instructions it\u2019s easy) are the pouring issue for the carafe and the splashing of grounds which do not appear to be an issue any longer. People mentioned having to ask company for an extender, per the pic I\u2019m including it appears they have fixed that as mine has it built in to the lid of the carafe. As far as the grounds going over the edge because of how fast the coffee sprays out, I took that seriously as I was gonna search for a reusable filter. I have not used a paper one so I can\u2019t speak to that but, I did find a filter from the \u00d6sszefut store here and it works perfectly. Folks said coffee needs to be ground differently from store bought but I have not had a problem with store ground coffee using this filter and we use a whopping 5 scoops. No grounds have gone over the edge at all.Coffee is fast, very hot and clean tasting. Highly recommend this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this coffee maker, which is new to me, for about 5 days. I've learned a few things. It's a really good coffee maker, but you have to read the instructions carefully. And even if you do, you still have to tweak it. I used to work in a convenience store and got very close to buying one of those machines with the double warmer and the two carafes, etc. I'm kind of techy like that. If you want a machine that \"just works\" and you don't mind kind of medium-OK coffee, then this isn't what you want. I want, and am getting, high quality, \"tastes like I bought it in a convenience store or fancy cafe\" coffee. But here are my tips, so far:1. The first mistake people make, including me, is buying pre-ground coffee. That stuff is WAY too fine. You can mix some pre-ground in, but you MUST grind the majority of the coffee yourself from whole bean coffee. Try counting to 10 while grinding. Turning it off. Shaking the grinder. Then grinding for another 10 seconds. That's all. No more. If you ever used a percolator, you know it's more like 2x5 seconds. This is 2x10 seconds. An ordinary coffee machine, the slow kind... is 3x10 seconds. Grinding your own coffee is the first tip.2. If you must have flavored coffee (I have to have my pumpkin spice seasonally and I love blueberry coffee), For a full pot, you put three heaping ordinary tablespoons of your own ground coffee. Then two tablespoons of flavored coffee (which will probably be ground too fine to use alone). Mixing the fine coffee with the less finely ground coffee is how you prevent the coffee from spilling out of the funnel. You don't need the next tip if you grind your own, and mix with the finely ground coffee.3. The alternative sprayhead (which is available by simply filling out a form on their website, like a \"contact us\" type of form), is important. It's free. You don't have to hassle with it unless you want to, as long as you grind your own coffee, not too fine. But I got it anyway and it prevents the spillovers.4. Don't use the table for \"how much coffee\" that's included in the instructions. Or follow it but use teaspoons, not tablespoons to measure. For some reason that table is totally wrong and will cause spillovers, especially with finely ground, or pre-ground coffee.5. For warranty repairs, or their excellent customer service, you will need your \"date code\" which is, crazily, on the bottom of the coffee maker. That's just awful design. Think about it: I have a half gallon tank of very hot water, and now you want me to turn it upside down, to look at a number on the bottom, to get help with it? Loony. Take a picture of that date code before you fill up your coffee maker with water. Or place the coffee maker on a glass table and then look at it or snag a pic. Then use the customer service contact page to ask them nicely to put the date code on the side of the machine.You can get high quality cafe coffee from this coffee maker. But you have to be techy and fiddle with it. It helps if you've worked in a store or cafe where Bunn machines are in use all day. Then you know what it could look like, taste like and what changes to make. If you get stuck, call them up. It can't hurt. USA made products from a family business are a wonderful thing indeed.1/2024 Update: Still works great, no spills at all. I fill it up to the 8 cups mark, makes 3 huge mugs of coffee (I only have huge mugs, no time for little teacups). I use about 4 Tablespoons of coffee, 2 T regular home-ground (coarse) coffee, and 2 T regular store bought (fine) ground flavored coffee. This is with the alternate spray head that pours more slowly. It takes about 7-8 min to get my coffee. I've had no problems with hard water, or with softened water. I have softened water. Using bottled water seems to result in a slightly larger volume of water released. Not sure why. So if you're making maximum size pots of coffee, you might want to keep that in mind.",

Overall, I am very pleased with it but there are a couple of things I like to see improved.I really wish there was a timer for the burner switch. We have been careful about turning it off when the coffee pot is low or empty but the timer would be an added protection for not forgetting to turn it off.Also, I am not too happy about the price of Bunn coffee filters. I prefer the non bleached kind, I didn't see any Bunn non bleached filters although I may have missed them. For this type of coffee pot you need have to have a thinner filter because the water comes through pretty fast and needs to flow through the filter easily. Otherwise it will back up and you will have coffee grounds and hot water overflowing and making a huge mess. This hasn't happened to me yet as I am using the filters that came with coffee pot.Edit. I did try a different brand of non-bleached filters. Didn't work.",

This is exactly the problem that I have with this unit.You can also not make a pot for a few days with it, and the water in the rear reservoir will cool right off, you never hear it heating the water back up.Useless if you have issues with acidic coffee acid reflux.I use good coffee with my unit, the McDonalds grind, and I get acid reflux from this unit but not from the coffee that I buy from the drive-thru.
