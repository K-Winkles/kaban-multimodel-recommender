Works quickly, and it\u2019s inexpensive.BUT - the lid doesn\u2019t go up all the way, so it is very awkward to pour in a cup of water. The stream of water is not smooth - bunch of big drops rather than a stream - going into the cup when making coffee, so splashes on the counter all around the appliance.I would not buy another one.",
