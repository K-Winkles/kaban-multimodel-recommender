                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This petite coffeemaker has turned out to be the perfect morning remedy for our daughter in her tiny college dormitory.With kitchen counter space at a premium, she has been looking for a source for morning java that doesn\u2019t take up a large counter footprint. We weren\u2019t familiar with the Mecity brand but with the listed features, compact size and sleek basic black appearance, we figured it was worth a try. As an added benefit, it matched the black, white and silver kitchen d\u00e9cor in my daughter\u2019s dorm.The appliance works with both K-cups and ground coffee which makes it very versatile for college kids who like to try specialty brands and boutique flavors. It\u2019s also a very efficient hot water dispenser for teas. All reports from the dorm confirm that the coffees and teas have been full flavored and delicious.At only 11 inches tall, less than 10 inches deep and less than 5 inches wide, this can fit snugly on just about any size kitchen countertop or even on a desk top if you want to have a cuppa on hand when you\u2019re working or studying. Operation is a one-touch breeze using nothing more than the front button and either inserting a K-cup or grounds.The unit features 2-minute brewing which is great for those early mornings when you need a quick pick me up punch of caffeine. It has easy to follow instructions so you\u2019re downing your coffee or tea in no time flat. It\u2019s easy clean up, too, especially when you are using coffee grounds because the Mecity grounds holder uses an inner shell to hold the grounds in place within the outer capsule \u2013 nothing goes splashing around and all the used grounds stay in the shell instead of staining the inside of the brewing chamber.Every automatic coffee maker gets funky after awhile so you\u2019ll have to clean it out. You can easily descale simply by pressing and then holding the power button for three seconds. The machine will automatically descale until the process is complete or until it runs out of water. You should repeat this process at least three times to make sure the system is clean and then you won\u2019t have any aftertaste or lingering odors.Speaking of running out of water, the one minor defect of the machine is that the water well only holds 12 ounces of it. Of course, the small size of the unit pretty much dictates this, so I\u2019d suggest \u2013 as my daughter does \u2013 to keep a water bottle full and handy for quick refills on those days when two or three cups just don\u2019t wake you up.Overall, my daughter and her roommate report that the machine is a neat little no frills coffee maker. It\u2019s a few steps up from the nicer hotel models but nothing really fancy. It\u2019s functional and flavorful.",

                "reviewText": "I was not expecting much from this compact K-Cup and ground coffee machine - it looked too \"basic\"I got it on a whim so I could whip up some coffee when I am working in my home office. I was pleasantly surprised!First it has a nice sleek unassuming design, it doesn't look cheap [that was one of my concerns].It has two methods for brewing, you can use a k-cup or use your own ground coffee or tea.One button operation. Heats up fast and within seconds the coffee starts brewing.Auto shut off. Dispenses 6, 8 and 12 oz servings. Even has a descale feature.BUT none of these features matter if it doesn't produce a good cup of coffee! And it does! It makes a delicious cup of coffee. This machine may look basic but sometimes simple is best. And that is what I found in this little compact coffee maker. Yes, I recommend it 100%.",

                "reviewText": "We probably don't need another coffee machine at home, but I do need one at work. Usually at home, I try to make my own cold brews and grind my own beans. However, at work, there's just no time to do that.What I like about this machine is that I can either use k-cups or bring my own fresh ground coffee from home. You get 2 different inserts depending on what you want to make. What I like about this machine is the ease of use. Also, I like that the powercord rolls back I to the unit to save space. We will see how this hold up over time as most my vacuums with similar cords end up not working in time. It is made of mostly plastic bits which is fine for the price, but it does feel a little less luxurious. Overall, this makes a good brew.",

The water reservoir opening is large enough to eliminate spills when filling. It heats quickly, dispenses quickly & only makes a few little squeaky noises as it finishes. Pour fresh water with every cup, rather than having a large reservoir of stale water. No need for wasteful paper filters. Simple one-button operation. Cord can be shoved back inside the unit, if desired.",

It doesn\u2019t have a reservoir; you fill it each time you brew a cup of coffee. It\u2019s still easier than my French press, which is why I wanted it, but it\u2019s not as nice as a name brand single brew. The coffee it brews is passable \u2013 at least as good as a k-cup brand machine with a filter-adaptor. It\u2019s not great, but the convenience is worth it most days. For what it is, it isn\u2019t bad, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to get one either.\u201d",

Just pour in the cup of water, add your coffee to the basket, place your cup and push the button. Wait 2 minutes or less and you've got that first eye opening cup of coffee.Love this little machine.",

At first, I thought it wasn\u2019t working because I had followed the directions, and it was working. As it turns out, I missed one step. You push the power button to heat up the water and you push it again when you are ready to brew the coffee.",
