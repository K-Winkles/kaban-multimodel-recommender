Use a circular motion over the ground coffee until soaked. Slowly pour the remaining hot water into the filter. Step 3 The Coffee will drip into the borosilicate glass carafe. For the best possible flavor, let it brew for about 4 minutes.

                "reviewText": "As a coffee enthusiast, I've tried various coffee makers, including the French Press, Aeropress, OXO 8-Cup Coffee Maker (Gold Cup certified by SCA), and ceramic Hario V60. However, this double-walled BODUM is quickly becoming my favorite. I would give it 5 stars without hesitation.Firstly, the coffee produced by this pour-over coffee maker is excellent. The flavor is rich and full-bodied, and I find that the double-walled design keeps the coffee nice and warm without over-extracting the coffee. The double-walled design also makes it easy to handle the carafe without burning my fingers.Secondly, I appreciate how easy it is to use this coffee maker. The simple design makes it easy to brew a perfect cup of coffee every time, and the cork grip adds a nice touch of style and comfort. It's also easy to clean, which is always a plus.Lastly, the double-walled version of this coffee maker is great at keeping the coffee warm for an extended period of time. However, it doesn't come with a lid, so you need to drink the coffee quickly or transfer to a thermal carafe. That being said, this is a minor issue compared to the overall quality and convenience of the design.Overall, I would highly recommend this BODUM to any coffee lover looking for a high-quality pour-over coffee maker. The flavor of the coffee is great, it's easy to use, and the double-walled design keeps the coffee warm. It's quickly becoming my go-to coffee maker, and I'm very happy with my purchase.",

However it sure has been used for coffee too now LOL.\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0e51\u06e9 PACKING / PRODUCT PACKAGE \u06e9\u0e51\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfThis item comes in its own box and packed well enough to not have issues in transit.\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0e51\u06e9 QUALITY \u06e9\u0e51\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfVERY! I was surprised at the quality of this coffee maker. The glass itself is thicker then I expected. I have accidentally tapped it on my granite sink side and winced. But there were no issues at all! The filter at the top has very small holes. Very high shine metal which has not stained with repeated daily use. The plastic that holds the metal panels is heavy duty and quality. Around the middle you see a black wrap. That is hard plastic with a softer stretchable rubber that wraps around it to hold the plastic in place. It is thick and does provide a good grip when pouring.\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0e51\u06e9 USE \u06e9\u0e51\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfI use this for loose tea and for coffee. Use a cone coffee filter in the top if you find you are not gaining the strength of coffee or tea that you would like. This will slow the water down and allow it to sit longer with the grounds or leaves. Using is super simple, just set the cone in the top, scoop in your grounds (medium grounds if you can) and heat water in a kettle on the stove. Just before water boil, you know when you see steam but not bubbles just yet. Pour that slowly over the top of the cone, I personally like to pour it around the edge of the filter to wash the grounds or leaves back into the middle. Either way you do it, you will find your zen with it. It really is a relaxing task for me, forces a person to slow down and enjoy the moment, the smell of the fresh coffee, and the warmth of the water.After its all filtered down, I toss the grounds or leaves out and rinse the top filter right away, setting that out to dry. It comes with a sturdy plastic center stopper, just pop that in the middle and pour your mug. It stays reasonably warm for a lingering amount of time. Through a good 2-3 cups of coffee easy. (I bought the 34 oz)\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0e51\u06e9 NOTE \u06e9\u0e51\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cfI would gift this in a heartbeat, it is unique, pleasant to use and quality! Warm wishes to everyone!",

                "reviewText": "This has been a great pour over coffee maker. It's easy to use with simple durable parts. It is easy to use and produces a great cup of coffee. I have been using a variety of coffee and I feel it's superior to the taste I get from a re-usable Keurig pod or even a premium Keurig pod. It's less bitter than my french press as well.There are two small downsides. First, it's about 16oz of coffee. That is great for me, but it would not be efficient for 3+ people. No big deal - that's just how it is and I got it for basically making 2 cups at a time so I love it. The strap can be a little annoying because no matter where I put the drawstring it's still something you can feel when you old the coffee maker. It's not a design flaw - it just is there and you can feel it. Since I only pour 2 cups out of this, it has never been an actual problem.",
