It makes up to 25 oz. of coffee, just right for two 12-oz. cups, and the compact design fits nicely into small spaces. The updated, ergonomic carafe design with ounce markings takes the guesswork out of measuring. Just set it up, turn it on, and brew. Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause allows you to stop the brewing cycle to pour a cup, then continue brewing until complete. The easy-to-use ON/OFF switch indicates when the coffee maker is on, and reminds you to shut it off. All you need to do is sit back, sip, and enjoy!Care & Maintenance: Make sure your coffeemaker is unplugged and has cooled completely before cleaning. Remove the brew basket, filter carafe, carafe lid, and wash them in a solution of hot water and mild liquid soap, and dry thoroughly.",

I decided to go back to basics and Mr. Coffee seemed like a trusted brand. The mini is the perfect size for me, doesn't take up too much counter space, and does everything it needs to do with no bells and whistles or things to break. I do wish it had an auto-off feature but otherwise it's a solid coffee maker in the right size for a good price. I have been using it daily for 3 weeks and not experienced issues with drips or leaks as others have mentioned. No complaints!",

My only issue is that the lid you need to open to make coffee opens right to left (like the cover of a book).

A slight inconvenience and us lefties are used to products designed for right-handed people, but it is still annoying.",

That one is at a ridiculous price when you add in a highway-robbery price for delivery. What would show up in my searches on Amazon was this 5 cup version. I had resisted buying it for about a year, but finally ordered it a few nights ago -- then promptly cancelled the order because some reviews made me think I wouldn't like it. Fast-forward to last night shortly before midnight. I decided to give this maker a chance to prove it was worth buying, so I hit the buy button. It was here, waiting for me when I woke up today.I love it. The design differences between this model and the 4 cup one were things I thought I would hate, but I don't. Really, I have only one quibble. The filters don't fit nicely in the filter holder, but that doesn't affect how they perform. Over time I may be disappointed if the pot's lid gets coffee stains on it. Cleaning this 5 cup model is easier than the 4 cup one is. That's because my hand fits more easily in the pot for drying it, thanks to the bigger size. I also like the finish on this model. It's mostly a matte white which will go with the matte white toaster oven I'll be receiving tomorrow.I also like the on/off switch that is on both models. I use an Echo smart plug that I can turn on via my voice as soon as I wake up: \"Alexa, turn on coffee.\" The switch is always in the on position but the plug is off until I tell Alexa to turn on the coffee. When the maker is on, I appreciate the fact there is not automatic shut off after a certain length of time, like there is with other coffee makers. When having two mugs of coffee, I often don't get around to drinking the second mug till an hour or more later. I want it to be hot when I'm ready for it. Reheating coffee in the microwave is not the same as having the pot on the heat. There's a scientific reason for this.Now about the coffee: it tastes great with both models. I think it takes the 5 cup model longer to make the coffee but it's really not an issue. I will never brew 5 cups. Most often, I will use the 2-cup setting with 3 scoops of coffee. I like it strong. Someone needs to let Mr. Coffee know they are lousy at measuring cup sizes. My mug (which looks bigger in the photo than it actually is) holds 11 ounces. The 2 cup setting delivers a little less than 11 ounces. I think Mr. Coffee uses the usual cup size other coffee makers do: just 6 ounces per cup (not the expected 8 ounces for those of us who use a regular measuring cup for our cooking needs). But the 2 cup setting gives me less than 12 ounces. It's closer to 10.5 ounces. I doubt I'll ever use more than the 4 cup setting which will give me two mugs of coffee.The pot is easier to pour from versus the 4 cup version. Getting the last little bit out of the 4 cup version is difficult, but super easy with the 5 cup version.It's obvious I love this 5 cup model. I hope Mr. Coffee won't stop making it in the future like they did with the 4 cup version. When I need a new coffee maker, I want this model to be here, ready and waiting for me to hit the buy button again.UPDATE: After using the coffee maker for a while I noticed the lid on the pot has a faint stain that I can't wash off. I expect it to get worse over time so I ordered the black version so I could use the black pot in my white coffee maker (see photo). I know it'll get stained too, but I won't be able to see it. Totally worth it.",

                "reviewText": "So, some disappointed. I give this Mr. Coffee three stars. Anyway, one star for small footprint on my very small kitchen countertop. Second star is for the shortness of the power cord as that works well in tight, limited space. Third star is it's simple - just one switch to flip to on.Brewing coffee - well, um - not great. Biggest complaint is brewed coffee not hot! Had to microwave (hate using microwave) to get cup of brewed coffee to acceptable temp. Poured one cup, which I had to heat by microwaving and let remainder of brewed pot sit on heater element for at least 15 minutes. No luck with that as second and final cup not hot enough either.Update: So yes, changing my review from 3 stars to 5 stars. Didn't like this coffee maker much when first received. Actually thought I'd donate it. But, had no functional coffee maker so as daily morning coffee drinker HAD to use, haha. After few days of using realized my biggest gripe: I was perfectly happy with my old coffee maker of 4 years and annoyed it died. Subconsciously, in my annoyance, looked for the differences between old coffee maker and this mr. coffee replacement. Judged harshly.Here's the deal. Been using this mr. coffee for more than a month. Everything I complained of now evaporated from my thoughts. I've completely accepted the loss of my old machine, learned to appreciate and enjoy this new machine - and viola; all ends exceedingly well.",

Love the 5cup compact size. Make sure to get the right Coffee Filter for this (2-5cup small). Do not buy the regular 10-12 cup filters. Also go easy when cleaning the pot as the glass is thin & the handle is not the sturdiest. I saw quite a few reviews from lefties complaining about the design of the lid because it opens from the right side instead of the traditional lid which opens upwards. I'm personally ambidextrous so I can definitely understand when I tried to use left hand to open the lid, pour the water, putting the filter and scooping the coffee in the filter. It's a bit inconvenient but for right handers, it's a clever design and simple to use. This little coffee maker is on the expensive side so it's understandable for people nitpicking it. All in all, I would definitely recommend it especially when it's on sale for around $50 Canadian Dollars.",

So basically the machine lasted for 2 months. On top of that a customer service agent on Amazon lied to me that I will receive a refund in 24 hours but I got no email stating that the refund was made so I wasted my time and money with the machine and the customer service agent. Avoid this seller!*******************************It is super simple, easy to operate reusable filter coffee maker that turned to be my best purchase! It makes up to 4 cups of coffee for less than 2 minutes and you just wash the filter under a rinsing water and ready you are for your next tasty cup of coffee! The only disadvantage is that the seller doesn't say you need to buy the reusable filter separately which was a bad aurptice for me expecting the filter to be included in my coffee maker purchase. This caused me to have my coffee maker unusable for 3 weeks at home while I was waiting for the filter to come by another seller. Once you have them joined, you can enjoy your coffee time.",
