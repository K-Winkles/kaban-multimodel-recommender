So I cold brew my coffee, then each morning I microwave it to hot, throw it in my Contigo travel mug, and it is hot and delicious and not at all bitter all morning. I get 3 or 4 days' worth in each 64 oz brewing. I use cheap \"Breakfast Blend\" Aldi regular-ground coffee in the filter (maybe 8 tbsp), and I find it to be just fine. (I also don't use creamer.) I'm just adding all this info for those new to cold brewing and wondering, \"How does this work? Do I need special coffee? Do I need to grind it myself?\" NOPE! You can, but it's not necessary. Play around with it and figure out what works best for you. I love that it's glass, but that also means it's pretty heavy when it's full. I live in fear of dropping it.",

I am very happy with this and personally am glad that I don't have to purchase paper filters for it. I personally use 1.5 cups of Amazon's light roast coffee beans, which has more caffeine than darker roasts. I bought the Mueller brown colored grinder to grind the beans and grind to 14 course grind and it works great for cold brew. I put 64 oz of water in the jar, part of which I pour over the grounds. I get 48 oz of cold brew out of it. I answered a question if anyone needs instructions on how I do it.",

Of course, this is all dependent on how you like your coffee. I prefer my coffee to be a little stronger than most people.Easy cleanup which is a plus.",

                "reviewText": "I initially was hesitant of purchasing this item being that it had no reviews at all. But now I\u2019m glad that I went ahead and got one.The glass container is basically your typical thick mason jar with a wide opening. So if you have any concerns about whether the glass is thin or thick, just think of a Ball-brand mason jar.The filter is definitely sturdy and solid. I\u2019m not exactly sure about the micron size of the filter\u2019s holes but the best way I can describe the filter itself is that it is a double wall filter.So far, I have brewed 5 batches of cold brew coffee in this thing and each batch came out consistently fantastic.One very important note about the kind of ground coffee you use for this brewer. It is advisable that you at least utilize coffee beans that have been grounded to Medium ground. But I highly suggest that you utilize Coarse grounded coffee instead. By using either Medium or Coarse ground, the likelihood of having a small or tiny amount of coffee granules getting through the double walled filter is almost nil. I used Fine grounded coffee on the first two batches I made and did notice very fine coffee sediments/granules at the bottom of the jar. It wasn\u2019t much but just enough that it was noticeable. This didn\u2019t really bother me but I know for some this could be an issue.",
