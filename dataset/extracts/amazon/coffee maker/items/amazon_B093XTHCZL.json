                "reviewText": "The most important thing a coffee maker needs to do is brew great coffee. This machine is shockingly good in that regard! Took it out of the box, washed it up, and ran a couple cycles of water through it to flush it out. Ground some French roast at a medium-fine setting (25 on my Rancilio Rocky) put two scoops of coffee in, filled the water reservoir, and two minutes later I was enjoying a really great cup of coffee. I usually drink Aeropress, occasionally Chemex or V60 pour over. The coffee from this machine is roughly comparable to those in quality - different of course, but not markedly worse. It's certainly far better coffee than my full-size Cuisenart drip coffee maker can produce.Only two criticisms really. I ordered a black unit and I received a blue coffee maker with a faux marble base. Since it's going to the office that's not such a big deal, but if I was buying it for my kitchen I'd return it for a replacement. Also, it would be nice if there was a stand to hold shorter mugs a few inches higher and avoid splashing. This coffee maker is really designed for tall mugs or tumblers.Ergonomics and thoughtful design touches: Scoop holder in the side of the unit is very convenient. Water reservoir capacity markings make it easy to fill straight from the Brita once you know much your mug holds. The lid folds well out of the way making it easy to fill with coffee and water. Everything is super easy to clean.Coffee brewing: Fast! Heats quickly and gets straight to brewing. Depending on grind, the brew cycle will take 2-3 minutes which is just about optimal. The water temperature is just under boiling and is spot on for making a well-extracted cup of coffee. The reusable filter is great and replacements are readily available.If you want to ditch the pods and easily brew single servings of great drip coffee this is the way.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Coffee maker is great! The tumbler sucks though",
                "reviewText": "Let's start with the negative because it isn't ALL that bad. Really, my grievances are with the tumbler provided. For starters, it is not dishwasher safe so that is automatically an issue for me. With three people in the house doing dishes, I am forced to wash it immediately for fear that someone else is going to put the cup in the dishwasher. It also leaks really badly. The seal on the lid is terrible. You can't tilt the cup at all unless you want a shift full of coffee.Onto the good. This is the best 30 coffee maker I have ever bought! It is simple to use. It brews quickly and everything is really easy to clean. I like how small it is because it doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter. That means I can have both my full-pot coffee maker out for the weekends one when I want to lounge with a pot and this one out at the same time! It just tucks into the corner. The brews are the same strength whether they brew hot or cold. I personally feel the scoop suggestions are too big but that probably depends on the coffee you are using. I use the smaller scoop for my coffee because I use a really dark french roast. That seems to work perfectly for me. I would suggest you try the big scoop as instructions call for the first time, but experiment with your coffee. The big scoop is about what I use to brew a whole pot in my other maker. Pro tip number 2! Prep your coffee ahead. Load the water, load the beans, then put your tumbler (a better one that is dishwasher safe) in the freezer with ice and a little honey syrup. Then all you have to do in the morning is hit brew!",

                "reviewText": "It is so hard to find a single serve unit that does not use pods or pod cup adapters that are fussy to use or is difficult to feed the water AND also brews a good cup...this unit has all the marks of being THE ONE... except...the flat grounds basket filter is insufficient to concentrate the grounds and the water to get a good brewing. If you use the small scoop they provide, the grounds will dissipate from the center where the water drips and give a poor brewing effort. Our Hamilton Beach dual brew does a better job at single serve due to the somewhat conical grounds basket.Am sure if you put enough grounds in this flat basket, you might get ok results but at a high cost.After much research, we found a great solution, a pour-over conical filter that fits just right and gives a great rich brew w just two teaspoons of grounds.We got our pour-over filter from Walmart but is identical to this one at Amazon: ANNMEXX Upgraded Pour Over Coffee Filter, Coffee Dripper, Paperless Mess Stainless Steel Coffee Filter,... US$799the Walmart one is:Yafex Stainless Steel Mesh Pour Over Cone Coffee Dripper Filter Tea Strainer Funnel (size S)This fits perfect in the Main plastic basket (excl flat filter basket)If MR Coffee would improve their filter basket, this would be unnecessary, but the pour-over filter is excellent and we find almost no fine residue left in our cups. One note of caution, folks have reviewed this style filter complaining they wont even pass water- you need to wash them w warm soapy water first to remove the fine machine oils, Also the small holes on the very bottom on ours would not allow the last amount of water to pass, but I used a toothpick to gently push in to the filter from underneath to make some space under the bottom filter section and this works just fine now. Seems like a lot of effort but I am impressed w the filter now and the coffee maker is worthwhile with it.",
