                "reviewText": "Pros:Very versatile. I like that it can take whole bean coffee, ground coffee, and k-cups. Produces good coffee when used correctly. I drink more coffee than ever before. The grinder dispenses almost the perfect amount (I usually add another 1-2 seconds of grinding to top it off).Cons:It is difficult to remove the used grounds from the reusable filter. Sometimes I use it, but I also buy K-Carafe sized individual paper filters. That way, you can simply remove and dispose of the filter. These work pretty well, but it overflows a tiny bit. It doesn't cause a mess, it just drips out the side of the bottom funnel, into the cup.Also, sometimes the machine makes a little bit of noise, even when turned off. If it bothers you, you have to unplug it.Neutral:Coffee from the reusable filter tastes a little different than coffee from paper filters and k-cups. If you don't like it, you can buy k-carafe sized paper filters to use instead.If you want to use pre-ground coffee, you have to be fairly exact about the amount. Just a bit too little and you'll have a weak cup. A bit too much, and it will overflow a bit. You want to get it just so that you can barely see the top outline of the mesh filter. If you buy individual paper filters, it's not as sensitive.",

It works easily and is easy to clean and makes great coffee. Now he can have a precise brew of whatever coffee he wants and it always tastes great. The only issue with it is that some of the grounds drop out of the grinder after you remove the receptacle for the fresh grounds. So I made a little wooden tray that catches the grounds. When my friend visited and saw this machine, she was all about it and said she was going to purchase one she liked it that much.",

Some reviews complain of grinds flying out, but ours wasn't so bad, though it is messy. Freshly ground beans for the early dark-o-thirty coffee pep dumping directly into a pod is simple and convenient, the coffee quality is better, waste is less, and pod cost is zero. Its quick and easy for the groggy coffee drinker. I just can't function first thing in the morning and need a fast and very simple process. Win!The beans have to be super fresh. We tried existing beans [pretty old I guess, oops] from our cabinet but did not get the desired flavor until we used freshly purchased Starbucks Pike's Place. So the resulting brew is pungent and strong. yum. But would those grounds produce a better brew if the coffee maker was better?Unfortunately the coffeemaker doesn't make the best coffee. When we tried our existing pods [Costco's organic Pacific Bold] we were shocked at the weak quality of the brewed coffee. This Cuisinart produced tasteless, watery, diner-like quality pod brew.The brewer only offers 3 sizes of cups: 8, 10, and 12 oz. Due to the weak brew, we had to use the 8 oz setting to get a slightly stronger less watery brew, 10 oz being normally preferred.The water isn't hot enough [measured at 180] and the grounds are not pre-wet or held for a moment to get the most flavor.When trying the coffee maker with pre-made pods, the coffee was way weak, way worse that our existing Keurig.Our Keurig, with the \"strong\" button and the really hot water produces a much better flavor and a hotter cup - yea, shocking right? With very hot water and holding that water in the grounds longer, the Keurig flavor is more intense.Brewing with existing varied pods is important: pods offer a variety of flavor, strengths, and decaf for guests or ourselves when variety is desired. Changing out the beans in the hopper isn't convenient if you want a different variety. We really need a coffee maker that brews fresh single-serve grounds and pre-made K-type pods too.Would really like a standalone grinder that simply puts grounds into a pod quickly, as this Cuisinart grinder does, but without the lousy coffee maker. I have searched Amazon and other suppliers, a stand-alone grinder for pods doesn't seem to exist except for one no-name maker with very lousy reviews which I won't chance.We like the look of the white coffee maker on our white counter and white backsplash - really wanted to like this. So disappointed. Will be returning this.",

                "reviewText": "Reservoir is a good size and the grinding feature is great for when I want some ground coffee. After having the unit less than a month there has become a failure on the board resulting the the heating element not functioning. One of the capacitors seems to have come loose on the board. Upon calling customer support the tech, even after giving them the model number, they tried to tell me how to correct a plate warming coffee maker which this is not. Replacement would be for me to send this unit out to them, then I would get one maybe 3-5 weeks later. Again, love the coffee maker, dislike the lack of QA that went into this.",
