As empty nesters, I didn't have the need for such a large capacity pot, especially since DH is not a coffee drinker!Pros: Easy to operate and clean. Has a convenient Brew Later feature for folks who want to wake up to the aroma of fresh coffee. Very small footprint so it doesn't take up a lot of precious counter space. Stay warm plate delivers a perfect temperature second cup. Oh and did I mention, it makes a most excellent home brewed cup of coffee!Cons: I did see this issue listed in a few reviews and I have experienced it also...the coffee in the brew basket does not drain into the pot as quickly as the water is pumped onto the grounds. This causes the grounds to overflow and land in the carafe. I get around this by turning of the machine for a minute or so to allow the basket to drain. I then start the brew again to finish and get no grounds in my pot.I highly recommend this tiny pot especially for one person households, good value all around.",

I love the compact size of this machine. I pour water into the reservoir with my left hand, so being able to see the level of the water inside the reservoir on my right hand side of the machine is wonderful. It's easy to set the time and program the time to come on in the morning. After hearing that the larger filters don't fit, I ordered smaller ones which are readily available on Amazon. The 4 to 6 cup size filters work perfectly. I don't use the reusable basket at all.",

                "reviewText": "Got this to replace the Black & Decker which replaced my original Mr. Coffee 4-cupper when the glass carafe cracked. The Black & Decker stopped working all of a sudden - I was trying to clean it and the toggling power button fell out. I couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I was looking for a simple \"double-action\" push-button power switch, and found this model.Has been working pretty well. It came with a re-usable filter basket (haven't used it because I prefer using paper filters to avoid the hassle of cleaning the coffee stain) and a water filter (don't need the extra gimmick since I already have counter-top water filters).A few minor \"odd\" details: the water level of the reservoir is not readily discernible, have to use the glass carafe with the \"cup\" markings to fill water; the \"drain hole\" of the filter holder is off-centered because the carafe is wider (compared to my original Mr. Coffee); and the standard size paper filters are a tad too large for the filter holder so I have to make sure it is seated snugly - it was making a mess regularly before I realized what was happening - the paper filter was riding high but the weight of the coffee granules was not enough to push the filter down, so when the hot water starts dripping, the paper filter \"collapsed\" and the coffee grounds got around and over the paper filter, and into my coffee!Would have preferred my original Mr. Coffee, but the cost of the replacement glass carafe is almost as much as the entire coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I am the only coffee drinker in the house. I had an old Mr. Coffee machine with a thermal carafe that was upwards of 15 years old that this replaced. Love the small size- I can make about 1/2 a pot and that's plenty of coffee for me (I only drink ~2 cups per day). Like that it came with the reusable filter but it does let some grounds into the coffee. I have been using paper filters easily available on Amazon or your local Walmart. I also like the programmable function of this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "Mr Coffee has never failed me, I had the $10 one for about 12 years, but the plastic on top which keeps in the steam finally warped enough to cause issues. This is the upgraded version with the possibility of a brew later and 5 cups instead of my old 4.Love the \"Brew Later\". Set the current time, press brew later and it asks to set what time you want it to brew. Wait about 3 seconds, time stops blinking, good to go. Also it remembers the time, so when you press brew later another day, the last entered time blinks for a few seconds then takes if you don't press anything. I also like that the brew later has to be pressed. I was worried it might try to brew every day automatically, and that is not the case. Maybe none do that, but I was worried.Like my old Mr Coffee, reusable filter so no waste there, simple to clean, markings on the side water fill area match the liquid level in the pot after brewing (my old one was off by almost a cup by the end there, this one is accurate).Very happy! Gret price! Can't possibly be easier to use. Thank you Mr Coffee!",

My only complaints are it starts brewing and then shuts off and I only notice it when I go to get my coffee and there's only 1c when I poured 4 cups. 2nd complaint it will turn off right after brewing so I have to turn it back on so my husband can have hot coffee when he wakes up. It sometimes turns off before the 2 hour shutoff. My last issue is in order to get 4 cups of coffee I have to fill the carafe to 5 cups line. If I don't fill it to almost 5 and only to 4 I'll get 3 cups of coffee. Other than those 3 things it works great!",
