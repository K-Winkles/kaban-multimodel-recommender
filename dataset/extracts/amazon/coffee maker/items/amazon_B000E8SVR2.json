Though I am actually surprised by it. It has made my coffee taste a lot stronger then normal compared to the regular filters you get, which is AMAZING. I love the fact my coffee is actually stronger then expected. It isn't a health risk either so you don't have to worry about anything going wrong. Easy to use, and easy to throw away without a mess like any other.The feel is different, might throw you off at a certain amount of time, but don't worry about that. Something that can be used a great deal and get you far. The price is just right, and it does help with many things. You get enough to last you a great deal so I wouldn't worry about running out or anything like that. The fact itself that it makes the coffee stronger, should be enough, but if that doesn't do it, it isn't something that is bleached like certain filters. This makes it healthier for you in my opinion.",
