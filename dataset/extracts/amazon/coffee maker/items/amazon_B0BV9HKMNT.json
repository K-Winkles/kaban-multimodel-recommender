Invested in this new one and of course works well and makes great coffee. This one has a few less features than our old one but adequate for our needs. For the record, even with the limited use and only using good quality water reverse osmosis water with occasional cleanings, the original only lasted 5-6 years. To me this is not really made or designed that well but not sure other brands would provide any better overall results? We are hoping this one will be more reliable than the first.",

                "reviewText": "I've never owned a Keurig before this one because we always went through a full pot of coffee every morning in our family size Cuisinart. Recently I alone had to switch to DeCaf so rather than subject my entire family of caffeine addicts to DeCaf I decided to shop for a Keurig just for me to use for the duration. I have limited counter space for TWO coffee makers so I was shopping for a small Keurig when I found this one and instantly fell in love with the size and color. Now my entire family is hooked on the Keurig and I've relegated the full size Cuisinart to the pantry! The Keurig is quick and easy to use even with the reusable K Cups that we use with our favorite ground coffee and the variety of K Cups available means everyone can make whatever kind of coffee flavor or cocoa or tea they feel like at the moment. It takes up less counter space than my big coffee maker and looks beautiful on the counter. This was a great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Mine arrived in a brown box, not a Keurig colorful box like you see in retail stores. I contacted Amazon to make sure this wasn't a refurbished item, they assured me item is new. After I contacted Amazon, I saw a small sticker on outside box that says new item. The Keurig had new strapping tape to secure the reservoir and removable plate holder to the coffee pot. It also came with instructions, and coupons good through 2024.It is a wonderful turquoise color. I did the test run, and mine is not loud, as others have said in their reviews. The water comes out fine, doesn't spray everywhere. I use mine for Keurig brand Swiss Miss hot chocolate, which is delicious. The temperature of hot chocolate is very hot, as it should be.The reservoir size is small, it holds two 16.9 oz. of bottled water, with a little bit of room for more. For no more than I use it, that's plenty for me.The cord is on the shorter side, which is noted in the instructions as being for safety reasons-so the Keurig won't be pulled off counter by a longer cord. It works fine for where I have mine sitting.Overall, I'm very happy with this Keurig. I bought it when it was on sale for $50.00. I would by again, as it works and looks great for me.",

                "reviewText": "I have always wanted a Keurig, but I hesitated always because of the price, and the fact that I knew I wouldn't use it terribly often. I don't drink coffee daily, and I drink it at home even more rarely. But when my son or someone else is visiting, it's nice to be able to offer a cup of coffee quickly, and have it turn out right. I wanted one that has a smaller footprint, I don't have a lot of counter or cupboard space. In truth, this is a little bigger than I would have liked, but it I made it work. It's not huge by any means, but I know there is a slimmer model too. I know some of the models have various bells and whistles, but this is relatively simple. The only adjustment available is the choice of three different cup sizes. I would have liked to have a feature that makes it a bit stronger, but that's for next time. Overall, I'm extremely happy with it, and I'm glad I finally bought one. I'm happy with my choice.",

Have tried other Keurigs but this is the best I have found. Compact for space but makes about 3 big mugs before needing to refill. No question about replacing it with any other coffee maker.",
