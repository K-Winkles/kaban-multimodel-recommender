                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Single cup coffee maker is quick, quiet and makes a hot cup of coffee!",
                "reviewText": "I've used Keurig single cup coffee makers since the first one came out years ago. But, recent models have left me greatly disappointed. Based on reviews, I finally made the jump to Cuisinart and this model has met my expectations! I haven't had it long enough to assess longevity, but the single cup coffee maker is quick, relatively quiet, and produces a good, hot cup of coffee. It easily fits my 16 oz travel mug and the drip tray removes adding even more clearance for a bigger mug. (See pic - with/without tray)Having the carafe and single cup combined is really convenient too. I use the carafe mainly for gatherings and would typically have to store my carafe and then pull it out of storage for get togethers. While I don't use the carafe daily, I use it more often now because it's right in front of me instead of in storage, and I'm very happy with the performance and flavor!ConsOne con is the volume of the water held in the single cup reservoir. Depending on your frequency of use, you may be refilling often. On the pro side, the frequent filling keeps the water fresh (and is no different than filling your carafe each time you make a pot of coffee).The reservoir is located on the back of the unit. I haven't found that to be a problem as it slips on and off so easily. That said, if you place the product in a tight spot, you will need room to pull the unit forward to access the reservoir. Also, as you can see from my pictures, the reservoir is not completely empty before you are required to add more water. (see pic for light and water still in reservoir)The single cup maker produced some minor micro spatters on the cupboard but I took the advice of another reviewer and put a small dish to raise up my coffee cup. (see pic) Cuisinart needs to build the capability to elevate the cup on future models.My final con is with lifting the lid to place the k-cup. I have good clearance under my cupboards but the top still doesn't open all the way unless I pull it out. (see pic - under cupboard and pulled forward) I've learned to worked with the limited opening, but if you don't have a lot of clearance under your cupboard, you'll be pulling the unit out to place your k-cups every time. However, it's worth the trade off to be able to fit a travel mug under the single cup dispenser. I'm very happy with this product!Update Nov 2022: I've had this unit two years now. Works as well as the day I bought it. I do use filtered water. I've also been using a reusable single cup insert/filter so that I can use fresh ground beans. I've gone through two over the past two years. Where the lid attaches is a stress point that weakens over time and eventually breaks off the cup. Aside from that, my only complaint has been the spatter when using the single cup. But, a coffee maker that is quiet, fast, provides a hot temperature and has longevity is worth dealing with the spatter.",

                "reviewText": "Your honest & realistic review....I'm not going to discount some of the reviews I've read, but we all know there are people that couldn't breath on their own if it wasn't naturally automatic. Then you have your paid reviewers that lie about the competitors products. What I will say is I delayed purchasing this coffee maker for a long time because of a lot of negativeness.. you know the water leaking out of the reservoir and such. I'm sorry I even considered those reviews..!I've had Cuisinart before but wanted a dual. I ended up buying a Hamilton Beach dual brew and never was 100% happy with it.Lets start with the differences between the flat round vs the wedge type coffee filter/bowls.The Cuisinart has a V or wedge type basket which I find that it funnels the water into the grounds. The Hamilton has a nice open basket but a small water spout.. you know, where the hot water rains down on the grounds..? I always felt that it never fully extracted the flavor and it took more grounds .Now the Cuisinart had a nice large water spout in conjunction with the wedge basket directing the waters thru the grounds... I found I don't have to use as much coffee to get the flavor I want. There for makes a better cup of coffee.The only down fall but not a real issue is where you add the water. It is smaller and it does require a steadier hand or learn to pour with your left. I will say if Cuisinart would have reversed the designed it with the single serve on the left instead of the right, then it would make it easier. All I can say is Deal with it...Now this brings me to the single serve side. I have no leak issues and no problems with the coffee pods. I can see how the rubber seal can wear out or dry out in time, but I think using a pitcher to fill the tank might extend or resolve that issue. No one can predict the future... As it stands I love the single serve side. With your other single serves, you are limited to \"X\" amount of water and that is final. With the Hamilton, if you added just 1 oz too much over their 10oz, it would not allow you to use the single serve side.Now I like my coffee on the lighter side, but wanted to still use the convenience of the disposable pods. This is where I really like the Cuisinart. I use the old fashion 14oz travel mug which fits nicely. I found I could choose the 8 oz and then the 4 oz after the 8 oz is finished without changing or removing the pod which finishes filling my mug.YES... finally can get a full 14 oz mug of coffee while using a single pod resulting in good flavor..!So if you are on the fence... go ahead and buy this product, you won't be disappointed, I'm not. I just wish I purchased it sooner.",
