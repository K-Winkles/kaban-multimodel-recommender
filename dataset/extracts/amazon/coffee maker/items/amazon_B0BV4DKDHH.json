                "reviewText": "This is a really interesting machine. Not \"Barista\" at all (honestly, a silly name and the \"7 in 1\" is really pushing it too) but still a great and innovative machine. Really, this is a good machine for someone that has a small space and wants a small drip style machine that offers other options. I usually use a French press or Moka pot for coffee but honestly get tired of the cleaning/time that both require. I just wanted a simple/small coffee maker. A 4 or 5 cup style machine. Then I came across this!The Good:1. Auto off feature/simple one button operation.2. Easy fill water chamber holding 30 ounces or 6 cups. This is nice as most small machines are 4 or 5 cups (20-25 ounces). The chamber is actually separate from the basket chamber and has a nice large opening and is completely clear. Easy to pour in water and not make a mess. Clear water indicator also plus charcoal filter option. My unit didn't come with a charcoal filter btw.3. Basket can be used as a pour over and also uses standard #2 filters. I don't make pour over coffee but it's nice to have the option. Plus the basket works well and has a nice tab for easy removal though I just use #2 paper filters for easy cleanup.4. The drop down drip tray for smaller sized mugs is genius. Most machines I've seen you actually slide up or remove and re-install the bottom drip tray for smaller mugs. Annoying. This one just simply flips down. So easy and it even has slots so any drips will still fall into the main drip tray below. Perfect.5. The carafe is a French press container! Why not? I love items that multi task/save space and this is fantastic. Another great idea. Can be used in a variety of ways too.6. Relatively compact size overall though machine is deeper than most small 4-5 cup drip style coffee makers.7. The included \"cold brew\" strainer basket is a nice addition. I already have a Mason jar based cold brew system but this strainer basket is perfect for loose leaf teas and how I will use it. A great addition.8. Looks quite nice. The stainless on the top and band across the bottom have a quality look.The Bad:1. No size options. Essentially if you are not using the full 6 cups you just need to add less water or stop the machine. So the machine runs the amount of water you put in no matter what. It would be nice if there were 8 or 14 ounce options. I know this would complicate the machine but it would be nice since the tank holds 30 ounces. If you are making a 14 ounce mug you just need to pour in 14 ounces of water and then hit the power button.2. No warmer plate. Not an issue for me but I know most want this and it's usually standard on drip style machines. Not an issue for me at all. I drink my few cups relatively quickly and usually getting it cooled down is the issue.",

                "reviewText": "This coffee maker is basically an over-sized version of a single serve drip/k-cup machine. It does not have a hot plate to keep the carafe warm. It dispenses the amount of water you put in the reservoir. You cannot control the cup size with the machine. You pour in the amount you want to get out, and the machine runs until the reservoir is empty, like an auto-drip.It takes #2 cone filters, but it would be great if it included a reusable washable filter. I bought one on amazon, and it fits in the machine okay, but not perfectly.I like it because i can make french press in both a carafe or my single serve press without having to put a kettle on to boil. I use it for tea water as well. So it's pretty much a water dispenser for me.If it took K-cups and had two sizes of washable re-usable filters, plus the ability to control the cup size, it would be an awesome machine, and truly \"7 in 1\", but it would probably cost twice as much!I'm happy with it for the price. It fits my needs.",

                "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars So not worth the money",
                "reviewText": "First off, my large coffeemaker stopped working and I wanted a smaller unit to clear up counter space, the size of this unit was just the right size and the major consideration for my purchase. I don't do french press or cold brew so all of these accessories are stored out of the way. I can say that this coffeemaker does brew coffee a lot quicker than my previous device, and the coffee tastes just fine. The coffeemaker itself seems cheaply made and just a larger version of those single serve cheap units you find in hotels. I would say a fair price for the coffeemaker without the accessories is $30-$35, I guess the inflated price is due to included accessories which I will never use. You can buy a french press device for less than $15, and you don't have to assemble it as you have to do with this device. One irritant is that there are NO coffee filters included with the unit, not even a few filters to get started...you would think the manufacturer could have thrown a couple in, for the $0.02 they would cost them. Also, nowhere in the instructions does it caution consumers to let the unit cool between brews. Not everyone would intuitively know that pouring cold water on a hot heating element could make it inoperative, so if you empty the carafe and immediately try to make another pot, you will be greeted by steam and hissing and you probably won't do it again, if the element survives and allows you to. There IS a note underneath the water reservoir cover that does state you should let the coffeemaker cool 2 minutes between brews, but it's conceivable that you will never notice it until it's too late. Noting the reviews of unit failure shortly after purchase I have to believe some of those failures were due to the manufacturers failure to include a caution in the user manual itself. The carafe is uninsulated so if you like a hot cup of coffee after your first cup, you may be disappointed in subsequent 'warm' cups.",
