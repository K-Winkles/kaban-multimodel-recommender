                "reviewText": "This single serve coffee maker is great! Love the color of it and it works great! I really liked that it did come with a basket you can insert with your own coffee so you don\u2019t have to use the K-cups if you don\u2019t have them. The cord isn\u2019t very long but that is fine as we just use it on the kitchen counter by an outlet. It suggests you run water through first to make sure clean. Very quick and you have coffee fast! Great little machine!",
