We ordered another brand because it was cheaper and found so many things about it that we did not like. So we are returning that coffee maker, and we bought another Mr. Coffee. Just love this coffee maker. Easy to fill, easy to clean, doesn\u2019t leak all over the place. So much easier to fill from the top than pulling a basket out from the side; side baskets also leak all over the counter. We just enjoy the great coffee and the simple but perfectly functional design of this machine. It may not have a lot of bells and whistles, but we start every day with delicious coffee. Just love it!",

It is easy to use and nigh indestructible.I purchased it because my last coffee maker was digitally controlled. Well, when the chip started to go, it wouldn't even stay turned on to brew. This machine, without the digital control, just turns on, and then brews.One downside; it is a little tricky to clean the reservoir. However, a little bit of white vinegar run through once or twice every few months keeps the internal pumps clean and the coffee tasting good.Seriously, this has been one of the best appliance purchases I have ever made.The easy design also makes it super easy to self-repair. Some coffee grounds got into the pump, ruining the machine. I was able to easily repair it in an hour myself. In a world where everything breaks immediately and cannot be repaired, I found this ability to be a massive plus!",

                "reviewText": "Several days ago, while washing the dishes I dropped the coffee cup, which smashed into the coffee pot. Only the coffee cup survived. I waited 4 long days of no-morning coffee waiting for this to arrive. I am a senior with mobility issues who does not drive so its not like I could just run out an buy one. Once I received this, ran a pot of water through it, and finally made that pot of morning coffee - it was the best coffee I ever had and it was the best coffee maker that ever existed! I now leave the coffee pot on the counter and when all the other dishes have been washed and the sink is empty, only then do I wash the coffee pot. Its pretty basic, which is what I wanted, no bells and whistles, very easy to use. The cord is kinda short but that's ok by me as when its not in use its easy to tuck the cord behind it. It does have a little cubby hole to put the cord into to but its easier to just to hid it behind the coffee maker. If I had to I would buy again.",
