                "reviewText": "This coffee maker is sooo awesome!We loved our kerurig single cup maker that we had for 5 years that we never had a problem with and kept using because the coffee tasted good, but we found we were having so much waste from the single K cups and the cost of the better quality coffee was getting so high lately in price. Also my husband wanted to have a carafe pot to make larger portions to fill his Yeti thermos he takes to work instead of using 4 K cups to fill it, But every carafe combo I found was big and really tall and you would have to pull it out to use it and we didn\u2019t want to have to keep doing that.This model is awesome! The best of both world!The coffee taste really great!The water tank has a large handle to hold it when removing and comes off the side easily and has a charcoal filter in it to filter the water as it brews, the pot is a large 12 cup pot that is insulated and very durable. It doesn\u2019t have a heater plate under it which we like because when there is one the coffee always taste burnt after a while sitting on the heat. This carafe Kees the coffee hot for a few hours and warm for a long time after.The program to brew is super easy to use.The single cup is super easy and it lifts on the top and still fits under our cabinets!! All the rest we would have to pull out from under the cabinets to get the K cup in.It is sleek and very attractive in our kitchen.My husband just loves it and I\u2019m so happy how it looks in our kitchen.Only suggestion I have is run a full pot with just water through first before brewing any coffee, we didn\u2019t and it had a strong plastics taste to it, we dumped that pot and immediately made another and it was fine after that.We also ordered a package of filters to change once a month, as it only comes with one.The refills are not expensive and it\u2019s only one a month.We also bought reusable K cups with paper insert filters for single serve, it has lowered our amount of waste and lowered our budget on coffee supplies. Buying fresh ground coffee is so much less expensive while tasting so much better than most of the K cup singles and way more eco friendly.I highly recommend this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very well-made coffee machine. It is almost perfect. The insulated carafe is one of the best I have seen. Almost all of the liquid pours out and it is easy to clean. If you want really hot coffee, just run the machine for 6 cups without coffee and let it stand for 5 minutes before making a pot. It will then keep the coffee hot for hours. The removable water container is a nice touch. It can be mounted on either side or the back. a couple of things that could be improved on: 1. There is no tone letting you know when the coffee is done. There is a light on top that goes out when it is finished, and you will have to check that. 2. It would be better if it used the cone filters if you like a finer ground coffee like Malita. it will overflow using finer ground coffee if you make more than 6 cups of strong coffee. This was not a game changer for me, just a FYI.",

                "reviewText": "I received my duo via Amazon but when I ordered it didn\u2019t specify that it was from Costco. They shipped quicker than expected, and included a bonus 1 lb ground coffee, 48 KCups and a spare coffee machine filter. So I was already impressed before even firing it up.Love the slim design and removable water canister that can be placed on the back or side. Love not having to fill the pot with water first then pour it into a coffee maker, usually ending up with water on the counter.The design allows me to make a pot of coffee and then use a KCup function or just straight water through the KCup function without having to remove the full pot coffee filter. They function through two different places. This important to note because if you want hot water for tea, it doesn\u2019t run through the full pot coffee filter area and taste like coffee.The coffee comes through hot into an insulated pot instead of warm and heated on a burner resulting in a bitter cup of coffee. Note, there is no burner. This actually works well for us as having a water softener, as with our other coffee makers, on occasion after washing the pot and placing on the burner, the salted water has corroded other coffee pot burners.Anyway, the flavour of the coffee is superior to any other coffee maker I have had.Now, the one flaw; insulated pot doesn\u2019t close completely so the coffee stays \u201cwarm\u201d for two hours as advertised. Warm, not hot. Since my husband leaves for work before 5 am and coffee is timed for him, by the time I get a cup shortly after 6 am, it is warm, not hot. If I add cream, I have to reheat it in the microwave. This is a small point, not major but if you think it keeps the coffee hot for two hours you would be disappointed. The coffee is good enough to drink black though so without cream, it\u2019s usually warm enough for the first much needed cup.",
