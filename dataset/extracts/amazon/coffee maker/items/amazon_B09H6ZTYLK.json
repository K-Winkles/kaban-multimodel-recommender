I have a tried-and-true Bialetti but I wanted the option of making a larger pot of expresso. This pot had a surprisingly high rating for the price but now I\u2019m wondering if the material has changed because I don\u2019t understand why anyone would give it a 5 star rating. Fundamentally because it\u2019s not a moka pot \u2014 it\u2019s a coffee pot. It does not develop sufficient pressure to brew expresso so the end result is really just minimally filtered, percolated coffee. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the only primary problem with this pot. As you\u2019ll note from the photo, it\u2019s rusted. I used it one time and it rusted! The coffee stank and wasn\u2019t even drinkable. When I disassembled the pot, it literally smelled like a stale cigar. Seriously, don\u2019t waste your time.",

                "reviewText": "This is a larger percolator than we had before. I like the color, it has a matte black finish on the top. There are two differences from the one we had prior. This one is a little harder to lift the top with one hand, it just requires a differnt kind of pressure with your thumb. It isnt a deal breaker just took me a few times to become used to it. The second thing is the stainless steel is a lot thinner. Overall, it works great just doesn't feel as high quality as I was expecting.",

Now it does do what it's supposed to, the coffee comes out great However it's difficult to clean, trying to avoid getting scrapped or cut when trying to clean out the water reservoir because of the edges, and also cleaning the inside, in between the spout and bottom of the top container because of the design. Hopefully this makes sense.",

                "reviewText": "Nice coffee maker. I fill the bottom container with water up to just below the pressure valve, put coffee powder in the basket that goes into the bottom part, put filter and rubber gasket in the bottom of the upper part and screw the top part to the bottom part. Put it on stove and it percolates coffee into the upper part.Before buying I read another review mentioning difficulty with threads while screwing the top part. I was a little hesitant to buy at first but went ahead and bought it anyway. I used it for over ten days and had no difficulty screwing the top part to the bottom part at all. It probably varies from one piece to another piece. However, I do have another problem. While cleaning the bottom part, I had a good cut on the finger. The inside ring of the bottom part is very sharp. I have to see if I can make the inside ring blunt using a file. Other than that, it's a nice one. I am enjoying my coffee made from it.",
