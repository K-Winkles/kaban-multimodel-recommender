It's cheaper because it uses bulk coffee instead of single serve pods. Its easy to quickly clean and dispose of the grounds. The filter works well and there's no need to buy paper filters. I pull out the pot, brew a cup, dump the grounds, then tuck the coffee maker to the back of the counter... taking up very little space on the counter.",

No coffee maker in my life has ever brewed coffee hot enough for my liking until I bought this one. It is so easy to use, the insulated cup is very insulated, the coffee is hot and remains hot. Impressive 14 oz mug. Can't be more happy with this purchase. There was a bit of a delay in shipping and arrived a few days later than promised, but other than that, great seller. Coffee maker is exactly as described. Perfect coffee maker for one person. The Elite Gourmet EHC111A Personal Single-Serve Compact Coffee Maker Brewer has the 14Oz. mug that has a sip top. LOVE THIS COFFEEMAKER. HOT COFFEE FINALLY (and I am a person who has had many coffee makers in my life and always have to put the coffee into the microwave to get it hot enough). NOT WITH THIS ONE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! very cute, too. P.S. I have a BUNN coffee maker and it was expensive. I have had for some years. This little coffee maker beats it and for about $25 vs $180 ....the BUNN is too big for one person. This coffee maker is perfect and I don't have to keep it plugged in forever to keep the tank water hot 24/7. This I will be saving money on my electric bill, too. Fast brewing and HOT coffee are key. BRAVO ELITE GOURMET! BRAVO.",

You end up with a weak cup of coffee. What I done to fix the problem is I poke a hole in a cup cake paper and it fit perfectly inside the reusable filter. The coffee brews longer for a better tasting cup of coffee. It will be expensive to use baking cups for filters so I'm looking for some small filters that will work.Update. What works great is I regular coffee filter sandwich between the basket and the reusable filter",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace another type of coffee pot I just bought on Amazon. The first one worked ok but it had a terrible plastic, chemical smell to it no matter how much I washed it and aired it out. It was impossible to use. this new on is great.. no coffee pot the coffee goes right into the supplied thermal mug or your own coffee cup. No chemical smell. Easy to clean. The first coffee pot had a plastic filter that discolored right after the first use and you could not get the stains out of the filter. The new coffee maker has a dedicated filter as well..plastic one but it does not stain, very easy to clean. It brews fast and the coffee is very hot. I am single and live alone and this is perfect. If I had to make a second cup it would be an easy and fast thing to do..no problems. The color works great with my retro microwave and small toaster oven and my fridge. All in the same family color.. Anyway I am very happy with it. Also the thermal coffee mug that comes with it is very nice. I use it all of the time now instead of a regular coffee mug. But I could use one of my a regular coffee mugs if I wanted to..Ok I have to add an edit. The coffee maker lasted about 15 cups of coffee and than started to brew just a half a cup or a quarter of a cup. The rest of the water stayed in the coffee maker. I returned it for an exchange. The new one came and right out of the box it would only brew a quarter of a cup and the rest of the water stayed in the coffee maker. I tried all types of things with both coffee makers, plugged and unplugged, let cool down and such.. left it alone for a day but it failed to complete the brewing cycle. Too bad as I liked the coffee maker and the look and color of it but it failed to work. So the search goes on.",

                "reviewText": "For years I've been the only one drinking coffee at home, so I always used a stainless steel funnel to make my coffee and save counter space. That's changed now with one of our family taking a cup to work and another staying at home. So the old manual method became a bit of a pain! Elite Gourmet fit the bill. There's no denying that this is a simple device but it's extremely versatile and easy to use. I don't like those Kurig machines because I personally like a strong cup. With this machine I can load it with plenty of coffee and choose to make only 8 oz. Perfect! Others like to make a full 14 oz. flask of mild coffee - no problem. The great thing too is that once you push the button you can walk away, rather than standing over and pouring into my old funnel. But beware!!! Don't forget to put the cup under! There is no emergency stop button. Please, it's not what you want to deal with in a morning if you are in a hurry.One more thing to note, is that the cup it comes with it has only a push-on lid. For those in a rush that's a potential mess waiting to happen. We use another screw on lid flask now but that doesn't fit under the machine so we have to fill another cup and transfer it to the flask. No big deal because I use the flask at home. The lid on the flask keeps the coffee warm on my desk. This is a good solution - small footprint, simple and practical. Reasonably price too. Love it.",
