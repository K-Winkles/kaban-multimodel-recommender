How to Cool Down the Machine? Why doesn't machine work, only 1 cup and 2 cup buttons are alternate flashing?

It may indicate that the knob on the side of the machine is switched to the STEAM position. PLEASE turn the knob back to the OFF position. Then the machine will stop beeping and work normally. How to Pump Water? Why does the machine keep running with no coffee or water coming out? If the espresso machine is running normally, but there is no coffee or water coming out, it means that the pump can not draw any water from the water tank. PLEASE re-install the water tank 2-3 times. Turn on the machine and turn the steam knob to the WATER position to let the hot water come out for 20 seconds. Then return the steam knob to the OFF position. How to Set the Volume?

Initial thought after unboxing is that it is sturdy, nicely packaged and sanitary. The metal components are all stainless steel and the plastic components have weight behind them. Which is great since it is quite a bit cheaper than name brands like Breville and DeLonghi. Tested it not even an hour after arrival and everything works great! Instructions are easy to follow and I was able to make my first ever homemade latte with zero experience . I will continue to use this moderately and update my experience with both the milk frother and espresso maker.Also note that is does NOT come with a pitcher for your milk so you will need to purchase that separately!! I got by with a measuring cup to start.",

                "reviewText": "I',m in the specialty coffee marketing business and I've had several mid - low priced semi-automatic espresso machines like this from Delonghi, Capresso, and others over the last 10 years. So I know how to use these things pretty well to get what I want, a fast, rich full bodied cappuccino in the AM. This machine outperforms the other machines I have owned and takes up less space, is built better, has a more powerful pump, and it looks good (I bought the silver one). What's important is to get a decent burr grinder, one that specifically grinds fine for espresso and also a decent coffee bean. I prefer fresh small batch medium roast espresso which I get locally and sometimes online directly from a roaster I know, Klatch Coffee in Southern California. The steamer works great if you know what you are doing as it is mostly technique. Overall, I am enjoying this machine and we'll see how long it holds up.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little guy. When I was researching espresso machines in my price range I was discouraged by people saying you couldn't get a good one in this price range. And maybe if you're a true espresso snob you won't be satisfied with this guy, but I consider myself fairly snobbish about my coffee and so far I love this machine. Not everyone can drop crazy amounts of money on an espresso machine, and for those of us with a budget, this is a fine option. It produces beautiful crema and espresso that does the job and tastes delicious. The steam wand is fine - I'm not expecting the same quality as a \"real\" fancy expensive machine. It does the job. I took off a star because no matter what I do, it very very rarely produces a dry puck of espresso, and that is annoying, but the drink itself tastes good so I don't care that much. I'm a former barista at a small family owned coffee shop where we knew our stuff, and this machine isn't going to compete with a real coffee shop but it's a wonderful little at-home espresso maker for the price. I did purchase a metal tamper because the plastic one it comes with is kind of a joke. The only major con of this machine is that I'm constantly wanting to make espresso all day long. The process is relatively simple and even if you've never used an espresso machine before, the manual it comes with is pretty clear. Again, my only real complaint is the lack of a true dry espresso puck at the end of the process, which my old and terrible and very low budget Mr Coffee espresso maker did produce. I see in other reviews that this is a common complaint. Nevertheless I am enjoying my daily espresso.Also, it is SO easy to clean. That's a huge huge plus for me. My old espresso maker was a nightmare to clean, but this one has a removable water tank and tray so it's super simple.We'll see if it continues to perform this well as time goes on of course, but about a couple weeks in, I'm pretty happy.",

A very good machine for the price!A couple of suggestions if you\u2019re considering getting into espresso:1. Use a Burr Grinder and grind fresh beans. Espresso needs a very fine grind, and the whole beans ensure that the oils will brew out.2. You might want to use a scale to measure the right amount of grounds. These little espresso filters need more grounds than you might think.BTW: These filters have a little nub that has to be lined up with a groove in the handle to be removed. I didn\u2019t see this in the instructions, and almost accidentally broke the filter before really looking close at the filter/handle setup.",

                "reviewText": "I got this as a birthday present from my son. It is a real pump-driven espresso maker, not a cheap steam one. It is very compact. It heats up very quickly going from off to brew-ready in under 30 seconds. To steam milk, you need an extra 15-20 seconds for the steam to heat up. If you don't have a super-expensive grinder that can do very fine, even grounds, you aren't out of luck. This machine ships with a pressure-restricted portafilter. Espresso purists will scoff at this, but I didn't want to need to spend 400-500 more on a good grinder just to get a decent espresso. If you don't want to use the pressurized portafilter, you can get a traditional one at the manufacturers website. As for ease of use, it's very easy. Just a few buttons and one dial for steam. Altogether, I can go from \"hey, I'd like a latte\" to \"yum, this is tasty\" in about 3 minutes. That includes weighing and grinding 13 grams of beans, filling the portafilter, tamping, pouring milk, steaming the milk, pulling a double shot, filling the cup with espresso milk and foam. If you want to dip a toe into the world of espresso, you really can't go wrong with this machine.",

                "reviewTitle": "Exactly what I was looking for",
                "reviewText": "I was looking for a good quality espresso machine for occasional at-home use (3-5 uses per week), at a reasonable price point. This machine exceeds my expectations. It's nice looking and solid. It worked *perfectly* straight out of the box. The shots I pulled were tasty and crema-heavy, just the way I like them. The steam wand frothed up my milk quickly with hardly any effort. The user-manual is sufficient because pulling shots is not rocket science. I also received an e-mail from \"Joanne\" at Casabrews containing a few helpful operating tips and an invitation to contact the company if I need customer support - thanks \"Joanne\" :) I feel like this was a great purchase (hopefully, the machine has some longevity).",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for the cottage and it\u2019s pretty good value. You do have to preheat before brewing and manually cool after steaming if you want to brew again, but overall this produces decent coffee and the steamer is good too. It\u2019s not a Breville in terms of build quality - and the plastic top feels a bit cheap - but it\u2019s decent and certainly good value for money.",

                "reviewText": "I have had a lot of espresso machines over the years and this one is the best. It heats up very quickly - the coffee comes out very hot and you can adjust the flavour intensity to whatever you like given the professional level of pressure. The steaming wand works quickly and the pressure provides perfect froth. Also, I must commend the customer service team at the manufacturer - my machine developed an unusual issue with the steaming wand after several months of use - I emailed their customer service and received a very prompt response. After analysing the issue, the seller volunteered to send me a new machine - the new machine arrived just 4 days after my initial query - unbelievably GREAT SERVICE and I appreciate that the seller stands behind their product! I strongly recommend this espresso machine and the folks who are selling it on Amazon.",
