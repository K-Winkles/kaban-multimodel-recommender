                "reviewText": "This is really a personal size coffee maker. Its footprint is about half a sheet of notebook paper. Krups is a solid well-known brand. In Europe a cup is 6oz. This coffee maker is marked to hold 32 oz of water to produce 30 oz of piping hot coffee. 2 oz of water is lost by soaking through the coffee grounds. It leaves plenty room for adding sugar, cream or that Starbucks effect in my 32 oz tumbler that keeps it hot all day. It\u2019s well made and has nice looking stainless steel and black decor. The carafe is glass and pours better than our bigger one. It has a removable filter cup that holds a removable permanent filter with its own cute little handles. It\u2019s not made to easily use #2 paper filters. I\u2019ll buy a 2nd permanent filter now before I really need it. The whole backside of the coffee maker is the water reservoir. Everything is designed for quick, easy use and clean-up except the cord is 2 feet long and not removable.I can travel with this little one. Put it in my office. It makes a nice gift. Perfect for dorm rooms, tiny kitchens, or 1-2 people. I can share a generous 16 oz with someone and have one myself. I added a little hand-cranked coffee grinder. It has 6 grind settings. 2 fills grinds all the coffee needed and takes a minute to do both. We have an electric grinder. It\u2019s loud and not something you want to hear in early morning. With 2 lbs of coffee beans I put it all in a small carryon luggage duffle bag. The best part is I make great tasting coffee or tea anywhere I want without disturbing anyone and it\u2019s so much cheaper. No more gas station or fast food coffee for me.UPDATE: I just want to say I have none of the problems others have reported. No drips, spills, or overflows. The filter and filter cup both snap in to stay without forcing or relying on the lid. Water reservoir openings are large and can fill from left or right side. It\u2019s all one area. This Krups doesn\u2019t auto turnoff but the warming plate will shutoff after 1 hour. It has auto pause for a quick pour. But I\u2019ve never had a time when I can\u2019t wait for a pot to finish. This one is only 30oz. I think some complaints didn\u2019t get genuine Krups. This one has real metal and quality plastic parts where shown. Lookalikes are a very bad problem worldwide. Premium brands get nailed by bad reviews because customers think their product is genuine and don\u2019t question it. We have a Cuisinart at home with all the features. Just like cable TV, we use only 4 all the time. Hope this update adds comparison.",

                "reviewText": "I love the compact size. The reusable filter is great and very easy to rinse. This is the perfect size coffee pot for one or even two people. It does not take a lot of counterspace. The temperature is perfect. That was my biggest complaint about the Keurig. Coffee was bland and not hot. I have been using a French press, but wanted to go back to a regular pot for a while. I don\u2019t have counterspace, so I was looking for something conservative yet quality. I couldn\u2019t be happier especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "We got this through the Vine program and spent a good amount of time with it before posting our review here. First item arrived in a damaged internal box. External box was fine, but the inner boxes were crushed a bit. When we unpacked the coffee maker, it had a dent right in the front. So, we exchanged for an undamaged one. Second one arrived in perfect shape.We used this coffee maker for about 2 weeks. We were using a Bunn coffee maker (20 years old, built like a tank, and no frills) and the only reason we considered a new one was for the timer feature. This coffee maker looks nice, but feels like a significantly lesser quality than the Bunn. But, it works well.The good:- Timer function works great.- Strength adjustment (not sure if it's a gimmick, but it can be adjusted).- Reusable/washable filter basket.- Looks nice.- GREAT customer service by Krupps (explained below).The bad:- Lightweight, made with a lot of plastic.- Reusable filter works OK, but you get very fine grit at the bottom of each cup of coffee.- Easy to overflow (explained below).So, the second unit we got was flawless and we used it for about a week with the reusable filter basket. We noticed a bit of 'sludge' or very fine grit at the bottom of each cup of coffee. We decided to try without the reusable filter basket and use a paper filter instead. That's where we had another (and much bigger issue). Came downstairs about 1/2 hour after the coffee should have been made to hear the coffee maker gurgling and still brewing. That seemed odd, so when I went and checked on it, I noticed that there was very little coffee in the carafe. The filter basket had been lifted up so that the plunger to release the coffee was NOT depressed. The carafe should push the plunger in the bottom of the filter basket. In this case, the whole basket lifted up and therefore was not letting brewed coffee flow out the bottom into the carafe. Instead, the filter basket overflowed and spilled partially brewed coffee and grounds all over the counter and back down into the reservoir! So, it was constantly sending partially brewed coffee back up to the overflowing basket and back down into the reservoir.I examined the coffee maker and the basket has a raised tab on it. I assumed that the lid should contact that tab to hold the basket down. The lid is curved or warped, so there was a 1/4\" - 1/\" gap between the underside of the lid and the tab on the filter. I called Krups and they were VERY helpful. They sent a return label and I mailed the coffee maker back to them. They tested it and could not get the problem to happen again. They said the gap between the lid and the tab on the filter basket is supposed to be there. The returned the coffee maker and followed up with a call and explanation of what was tested. We agreed that it must have been a fluke. I still wonder why they put a raised tab on the filter basket if it's NOT supposed to be held down by the lid, but it is what it is. The only thing I can think is the time it overflowed, maybe the filter with the grounds was not all the way down into the notch causing the carafe to NOT depress the plunger. It has worked fine since.Top notch customer service, nice coffee maker. Could use some improvement, but overall works good.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little coffee pot. I have purchased the 5 cup coffee pots before from other brands and they\u2019ve been good but this one looks nicer and better quality. It makes a nice pot of coffee in about 5 minutes and it\u2019s nice to have the option of not using a paper filter. It is small but perfect if you\u2019re looking to make coffee for just 2 or 3 servings (depending on size of servings, mine is enough for just 2). What I like most is how it looks as it\u2019s is a very nice design. The only thing I wish was different was I wish the on button was closer to the front so I can see it or it had an automatic shut off only because I get scared I\u2019ll forget to turn it off. Otherwise it\u2019s perfect.",

                "reviewText": "The carafe builds up pressure once hot coffee begins to fill it and prevents the last few cups of brewing coffee from dripping into carafe and pooling on the lid. Result is you return to discover a mess 25% of the time all over the counter/cabinets/floor. Can't trust it not to do this! Had to put it on a cookie sheet to catch the flooding. It was perfect in every way, EXCEPT OVERFLOWING. I called Canadian KRUPP Customer Service = Lots of talk, Lots of questions, Promises made but never implemented. I had it exchanged and the same problems with the replacement. Our previous KRUPP Savoy was awesome lasting 10 years without once overflowing or any problem - sadly, no longer made. Sadly, KRUPP struck out and we will purchase another brand. Shame on them.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.Thank God for Amazon's good service for issuing a prompt refund twice. Much appreciated Amazon!",
