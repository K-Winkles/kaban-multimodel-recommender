I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone who wants ease of use, good tasting coffee and a beautiful unit. The price was amazing.By the way, I chose a refurbished unit that arrived looking brand new. It was well packaged and one could not tell if it was ever taken out of the box.",

And we drink a LOT of coffee.Having said that, however, for what one pays for this machine, one would think you would spend a little more money on the design of the hinge. The pins are quite tiny and today one broke off. So now the lid flops all over the place and is difficult to re-align and close properly.",

                "reviewText": "The machine works well, is easy to program, and produces good coffee.PRO:- The temperature control is a particularly useful addition over most models, though I wish I knew what temperatures each setting stood for. I don't like the coffee to be too hot so that it burns my tongue. I had started to pour the coffee into the travel mug before showering in the morning so that it could cool a bit. This makes that unnecessary.CON:- The drip pause feature (remove carafe and the spring stops it from dripping onto the platter) doesn't work very well.DEPENDS ON YOU:- The lid on the carafe does not pivot. It clips on, which may be helpful for letting you pour without the lid flipping up and dumping coffee out too quickly. It also makes cleaning the carafe harder. Don't know how well the snap-in tabs will hold up over time.PARTICULAR TO REFURB:- The refurbished unit that I bought has a large silver plug just off center on the heating platter. I returned the first for this and the second had it as well. I don't like it. It makes the carafe not sit particularly well on the platter. I'm living with this because I discarded the box and don't feel like trying to get it again. This \"plug\" was the reason given for returning the first one. I feel returning this one for the same reason would not result in getting one that doesn't have it. The machine works fine, but it does *not* look like an original, as Amazon's refurbished statement says it should. If the price difference between new and refurbished matters to you, this doesn't really have an effect on the functioning of the machine, but it is likely a thing you'll have to live with. (See photo for what I mean. Please ignore the coffee residue; the machine comes clean and neat, save the silver \"plug.\")",

                "reviewText": "Was a little leary of purchasing a refurbished coffee maker but this one is great! Makes a great cup of coffee, especially on the bold setting. Has a nice sleek look of stainless steel and black. I'm very pleased that Cuisinart has once again lived up to my expectations. I'll never buy a different brand.",
