I\u2019m pouring kettle-boiled water over a standard grocery store grind with the reusable filter that came with the set, and the last sip of coffee does have some sediment.

Title: Eco-Friendly Pour Over Coffee Maker ReviewRating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI recently switched to an eco-friendly coffee maker and tested it today. Here's my honest review:Material: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe coffee maker is made of good quality material, and the glass is not fragile.Quality: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe overall quality of the coffee maker is excellent.Ease of Cleaning: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe heat pad in the middle of the coffee maker cannot be machine washed, but the rest is dishwasher safe. Cleaning the filter is easy; just dump it in the trash, rinse, and put it in the dishwasher.Ease of Use: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe coffee maker is very easy to use.Filter: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe filter performs well, although some coffee may still end up in the container. I would rate it 4.5 stars out of 5. No filters for pour overs would be a 5 without paper filter liner in my opinion.Durability: N/ASince I just bought it, I cannot comment on its long-term durability.Note: This review is NOT sponsored. I made the switch for eco-friendly reasons.",

What more can you ask for??The good:- Quick and easy use- Design looks great on the counterThe bad:- The funnel can only take about 8 ounces at a time. This mean you have a wait a little in between pours if you are making more an one cup- Cleaning can be a pain because the cork handle should be removed.Pro tips:- This goes on sale ($5 off) every 90 days or so. If you\u2019re not in a hurry and want to save a few bucks, place in your cart and watch. It\u2019s like clockwork.",

                "reviewText": "There is a lot of effort to making coffee with this maker. You have to pour the hot water over the coffee grounds and wait for the water to pass through. All of the water will not fit in the filter, If you are making a full pot, you will have to pour water in a few times and wait for each pour to pass through before adding more. The pot is also difficult to clean well if you do not have a bottle brush.I had one before and the flask was broken. The old one had a nylon/plastic filter. When I ordered the new one, it has a metal filter. This new, metal filter takes longer to filter the water than the old plastic one. Also requires you to give it a stir in order for it to all go through.After all that, I like the way the coffee comes out. It is the only way I make coffee at home.",

I\u2019ve even bought my mother in law one who was never really into brewing coffee just using the instant. Now she uses hers everyday as well. It\u2019s great quality and easy to use. Plus side it\u2019s even easier to clean unlike regular coffee machines!",
