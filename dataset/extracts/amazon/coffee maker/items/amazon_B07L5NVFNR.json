It\u2019s straightforward with no complicated buttons or directions so you can plug and load, press and get your coffee. No frills, simple and dependable. In a world full of complicated coffe drinks and all the flavors adding to the confusion, this takes coffee making back to the easy cup of joe days. Has a timer and a clock on it. Easy to clean but tough enough to keep on brewing even if your old school and only clean it once a year. Up to 5 cups at one time. The old man loves the brand and the simple method of getting his morning,noon and night cup of coffee. It\u2019s lightweight and fits comfortably on any counter. If this has my father in law using it, it must be good. Great for just your cup of coffee and conversations on a corded house phone while you\u2019re reading the paper. Like I said, old school.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using a pour over coffee maker but it takes so long to make a cup of coffee I got tired of it. I admit the coffee was very good. I decided to try this little maker and I am so glad I did. I love coffee but I am not a coffee snob. I usually only drink it for breakfast and up till noon. I am using Folgers Decaf Black Silk which is no longer available so I will have to find another type when this is used up. I bought some Peets Dark Roast Decaf but I havent tried it yet. Back to the coffee maker....I use three tablespoons of coffee grounds to make the 5 cup water mark on the maker and it is just right for my taste. Brewing time is around ten minutes (guessing). It brews while I am cooking my eggs. The taste is really good. I like that the maker does not take up much room on my counter.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a couple 4 or 5 cup coffee makers over the years. The sub $15 Walmart brand sucked as one might suspect, never got the water hot enough. I had one of the expensive Japanese brands (Ziroshi or something?) and that made a good coffee. i could trust the water would get hot enough for proper extraction. But the bottom rusted out after a year or two. Not the hot plate where most of them rust out, but the actual bottom plate! I'm sorry, but for that kind of money?! I'm not going back. I like good coffee, but I haven't crossed over to coffee snob. At least not yet!This B&D coffee maker got good reviews and it was priced right. Closer in price to the cheap Walmart brand than the Japanese brand, but as long as i could trust it to heat the water enough and be consistent about it, I'd be happy. And I am happy. I've had it for a few months now and it has never failed to heat the water perfectly for good extraction.I'm also very impressed with the little things B&D had built into it that has significantly increased the bang-for-the-buck in my opinion. The hot plate has a design I have not seen before where it's separate from the sides that are nice and high so you never question if the carafe has been put back correctly. I suspect the slight gap between the two might be so it doesn't hold liquid if it overfills? There's also a unique mechanism for the \"sneak a cup\" feature. It doesn't soley rely on the carafe cover pushing the plunger up. That style doesn't work great for these smaller coffee makers, it's too light weight and you need to use two hands to return the carafe to the hot plate so it doesn't slide across the counter. The B&D coffee maker has some kind of a lever triggered by the carafe itself when it's put back on the coffee maker. These are some neat, well thought out features for this price point! Love it!A quick word about the sneak-a-cup feature where some have had it leak or worse, just keep pouring out! I had it happen once, pretty bad too. But I realized it was \"user error\". When setting up the coffee maker, keep the carafe off to the side until the top of the coffee maker is securely closed, then insert the carafe. When trying to close the top with the carafe in place, it may appear closed, but the carafe prevens it from fully closing and then that cool sneak-a-cup lever mechanism thing can't do it's job and close the plunger. Knowing this, I haven't had more than a tiny drop hit the hot plate when removing the carafe!I don't think you can get a better 4 or 5 cup coffee maker in this price range!",

Easy to clean as the water reservoir does not have any weird nooks or crannies. Doesn\u2019t take up much counter space and the cord is a decent length. The carafe is cute and almost retro looking which is why I bought it. I highly recommend this machine!",

I love the ease of filling the water tank, easy to place and remove the coffee filter. The glass carafe has a nice ergonomically handle, easy to remove the lid and fit back, and has an excellent pouring tip when pouring coffee out, no dripping at all. Best of all, it makes a really hot cup of coffee (unlike other cheaper coffee maker). It is worth buying if you don't want to go high end or spend a lot if money for a 5-cup size coffee maker. I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend buying.",

I finally got around to doing a deep clean of the machine for the first time yesterday and admit I should clean it more frequently to keep it lasting for a long time. I unplug the machine after each use. All in all, I'm very happy with this little guy and will continue to use it daily!EDIT: It begins to not work so good unless you frequently clean it, so I'm taking one start off. If I don't clean it, it will be slow and won't pour efficiently. I think I clean it out with vinegar about once per month.",
