No waiting for it to cool down in the fridge forever, or water the tea down with ice after. So easy to use, cleans easily, great quality so far. At first I thought the pitcher was flimsy, but she's been through heck and is lightweight and works like a pro. Best purchase in years! So useful and time saving. I use 3 small iced- tea bags on the strongest setting and add a little bit of sugar right on the ice before brewing, stir and ready to serve!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I waited so I could use it until I made my review. I am happy to say I have made 4 pitchers of delicious iced tea with zero problems of any kind. It\u2019s true, as others have pointed out, that the tea maker isn\u2019t super high quality as far as its construction goes, it\u2019s cheap plastic but it works and I am not unhappy with the purchase so far. The tea tastes excellent, it makes tea super quickly, I have used teabags and even added a little iced tea mix from Lipton that I poured right over the tea bags and not a trace of it was left in the filter basket after brewing. I was so happy that this item arrived in a box and everything was there. Prior to this purchase I bought a Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker from 2 different places, Amazon and Walmart. The Amazon merchant just threw the tea maker in a box with no manual, no pitcher, I think it may have been used, I was outraged, so I tried Walmart, they sent it in the original manufacturers box but when I opened it once again no pitcher! Couldn\u2019t believe it happened twice so I was nervous when I got this one but at last, I found a tea maker!! It\u2019s super easy to make tea. The pitcher is ok, it will hold more tea if you follow the instructions, I fill the pitcher to the water line to pour the water into the reservoir, I then fill a little past the water line and add ice cubes to the ice line when putting the pitcher into the machine to make the tea and get a very full pitcher. I am hoping this one will last me some time, so far so good! Unless you like really strong tea I wouldn\u2019t recommend going by their instructions for the tea bags, I put 5 regular bags in and it was very dark, strong tea, they say to use 6-9 regular bags! Now I use 3 regular sized black tea bags and toss in a cinnamon blend regular sized tea bag for flavor and a little of the iced tea mix that is a powder with lemon flavor, it suits me perfectly.",

The only downside is the lid on the top of the machine is thin plastic so it doesn\u2019t close all the way but not a big deal, but the lid on the pitcher you do have to be careful because when you\u2019re pouring from about half way the lid starts to slide off so you do need to hold the lid on while pouring but also not a big deal. As long as it makes tea properly that\u2019s a win for me and it doesn\u2019t disappoint in doing that. Good machine so far.",

                "reviewText": "I make a LOT of iced tea at home. I don't do carbonation, caffeine, refined sugar, nor artificial sweeteners, so I pretty much have to make all my beverages myself if I want anything other than water. I grow my own plants for tea so I need something that works with both fresh and dried leaves and flowers.I've used both the Oster and the Mr. Tea makers and they eventually failed because they were too complicated. Hidden water reserves you can't reach into to descale and springs with pressure-sensitive, filtered reservoirs which get clogged with tea residue and eventually fail to dispense the tea properly.This machine has none of that. You just fill up the water container, put the plastic tea basket on the plastic pitcher, pop on the lid and slide it under the water container's output nozzle. Super easy to clean and get all the gunk out. I don't love the plastic pitcher instead of glass, but since I put the tea into glass containers for storage in the fridge the plastic pitcher isn't a real problem. I use a VERY fine strainer in a large metal funnel, so no leaves, etc. get into the tea.I miss the ability to pull out the pitcher to empty as it fills, but at least there's no springs/whatever to go wrong and not function properly. Both the Oster and the Mr. Tea lost the \"auto stop when pitcher is pulled out\" function months before the machines gave up the ghost entirely. Having to wait for the auto shut off when the pitcher is full is a small price for being able to make a full gallon of tea in just two runs of the machine. I don't use any ice, so it's easy to top off the water reservoir as It empties with a total two quarts of water for each run.I empty the two runs into a gallon jug, mix in whatever else I want in the brew (lemon or other fruit juice, etc.) mix it up and put it into the pitchers in the fridge. It can be served over ice or just stored in the fridge until cold, which is the way I like it.Bottom line: It does the job, it's not ugly on the counter, and it was a very good price.",
