My original BODUM French press also leaked coffee grounds in tho the coffee, as the seal was silicone instead of a metal like this one. I bought this in replacement, and was thoroughly pleased with the size of the pot, as it makes 2 full cups of coffee. I like strong coffee, but instead of using the recommended 8 \u201ccups\u201d of grounds, I use just 3, and it produces a delicious bold flavor regardless. Very good quality!!",

When I disassembled the plunger to clean, I didn't realize the bottom cross ring didn't have the screw in mechanism attached. Thankfully it fell in my sink but at the time I didn't know that. When you're cleaning the the main beaker, the holder is cheap plastic and just falls right over. It's a French press and it works just fine. But, the quality of the French press itself is super cheap.",
