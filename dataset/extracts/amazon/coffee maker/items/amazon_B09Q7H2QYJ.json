                "reviewText": "01/31/2024 After 4 months, my glass knob broke on the pot. This appears, based on comments, to be a common problem. However, I shopped around and found a perfect replacement on Amazon, Univen Glass Coffee Percolator Knob Top fits Coletti Bozeman and Butte 2 Pack. I simply selected it because it looked exactly like the original knob. They were a perfect fit and I have an extra. Honestly, I think I caused my breakage when it fell off on my counter. I checked it, but I suspect it just weakened the glass and the heat did the rest. I'm very pleased to find a replacement so I can continue to use the pot. This is one of the small things in life that happen. Amazon or the vendor needs to list the Univen knobs as a good replacement. And 2 for less than $10 is cheaper than buying a new pot.Previous review: It's very basic and simple to use and it just looks really nice. Absolutely not a space hog that my other coffee maker was. I have a small kitchen and this is what I was looking for.By the way: for Watt information please read the Product guides and documents where it says Product Manual!",

                "reviewText": "There are multiple look-alike units offered from China. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. The EC922 and WEP1800 perk when initially plugged in (WITH COLD WATER!), and keep the coffee warm when the contents are already warm. Then the liquid-filled container can be removed from the base temporarily (taken into another room, for example) and then returned to the base to keep the remaining contents warm. Look-alike units have the an integral base, and so cannot be separate from the electrical source any further than the cord will reach. My original unit failed after very many years of trouble-free use. I had a very hard time getting a true replacement, having to return integral (one piece) units twice. Then the final replacement developed broken mounting holes inside the base (not initially discovered, and no, I did not tighten them beforehand), but I was able to repair them (glue and great care not to lose the VERY tiny bolts). Then the glass piece on the lid broke, but I was able to glue it back together. I have no idea why it broke, although it obviously experienced numerous temperature cycles in normal use. It did not receive any impact. I await the next challenge! The coffee tastes fine. Good luck! P.S.; If you ever buy and ultimately discard a unit of this type, disassemble the discard and SAVE ALL BOLTS. Tiny, tiny, tiny metric bolts. You are unlikely to find duplicates this side of the Pacific.",

This last time, the interior began leaking water, and having a burnt odor, so, I tossed it, and bought another one, just like it.If you need to replace the filter, a Mr. Coffee one fits perfectly and is easy to find online.I would like to congratulate the manufacturer for hearing our complaints about the carafe almost always dripping when we tried to pour water, or coffee, and they seem to have altered the design of the spout to not do this anymore!For my money, I would rather buy a new one of these inexpensive, small, perfect coffeemakers every few years, than pay a lot more money for another brand.",

                "reviewText": "If you like green to match your kitchen, this is the best! It is stainless steel, and a percolator, like the old fashioned style. Got this as a gift to replace an older black traditional model. This one has a power base, so when you are ready to brew, you can plug it in, and sit on the included base. There is an LED color button on the front, fill water, fill lines are inside, add coffee to included vessel, and hit the RED led button. When done brewing it turns BLUE so you can see if done from a good long distance away! I really like that! Take it off base to pour, and put back on base, and it will retain the warm temp for 2 hours, maintaining the LED color of done or ready for that time. Nice features, easy to use. Top sometimes is hard to push on, just jiggle the pot to move the vessel inside, and it snaps on. Nice so top will not just fall off when pouring! Mom loved the green color. I think you will too, green is a fade of 2 green shades dark to lite. I may get one for me. Makes up to 12 cups or less depends on how much water you put in it. Nice bright stainless steel inside. Plastic percolator clear top handle to see coffee percolating action. Neat!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this during the pandemic to reduce my warehouse crew touching the dispenser lever with their hands. About 3 months in I started noticing a super dark coffee leaking from the seam where the aluminum and plastic housing made contact and never really though much of it until last month when the power button stopped working and stayed on with the light on even after being set to the off position. Im a year past any sort of warranty, so I ended up opening it and was met with a horrible sight, the gasket was not installed properly causing coffee to leak into plastic housing that also contains all of the electric bits and this caused the power button to short out and melt the contacts points in place not allowing it to be turned off. Instead of throwing it out, i ended up replacing the power button with one i found on Amazon and waterproofed it with liquid electrical tape and with a 40mm socket and plumbing wrench i was able to remove heating element and DIY a new gasket with a water safe high temp gasket maker sheet.",
