                "reviewText": "Game changer? No, try life changer! This thing is awesome... Simple to use, quick to set up, easy to clean, and it is already saving me so much time and money. What's better than all that? Convenience of iced coffee ANY TIME at home. No more going out on weekends just to get coffee, and getting it into me earlier in the day is making me more productive. Options for what beans you can use will expand too vs whatever the coffee place uses, free to change it up or experiment with different roasts.I got the 2qt because I figured with brew time it would last longer between batches, and it's perfect. I feel with the smaller one you would have to empty it right away and begin brewing the next batch to be ready on time, I've had no gaps in it being ready so I highly recommend the 2qt. This is all about making life easier right? The coffee stays nice and fresh all week. I got a container with a seal to store it when it's about half way so I can get the next batch going. I've been using whole beans and works great, no grounds or crumbs, flavor is great, and very strong. I brew it a day and a half - 2 days. Perfect. A 1lb bag gets me 3 brews, so just over 5oz a run, each brew lasts me about a week. If I diluted it more it would last longer. Way cheaper than almost $4 a cup for sure!!!The coffee is so delicious, I love it and enjoy it far more than any coffee I've ever had. I only drank coffee for caffeine, now I find myself wanting it because it's so tasty... It isn't nearly as bitter so you need way less sugar or cream. I usually use a hazelnut creamer and don't even add sugar anymore. I also don't think it's staining my teeth as bad. I didn't know if it would be as strong caffeine wise but oh yes it is! Also, no more straws or single use cups!!! Bought 5 cups with lids so I have one for every work day no matter what.So if you enjoy iced coffee, or better flavor of cold brew, and are like me who drinks ice coffee even in dead of winter you need this! Has already paid for itself!!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, a device that makes great cold brew",
                "reviewText": "I'm a cold brew aficionado. I have tried several products to make my own cold brew rather than getting store-bought cold brew and they have all failed and have been returned. Until now. I have had the large Takeya cold brew maker for less than two weeks, but I can tell you, this one is a keeper. I have already made about 10 batches and I'm now having fun trying different coffees. Right now, I am trying 2 blends and comparing.My process is simple, I fill up the pot with filtered water to about an inch from the bottom of the white rim. I load up the filter with coffee ground coarse to the top of the filter. I attach the extension and then the lid, and slowly dunk the filter in the water. I tighten everything and swirl the water around for a minute or two to wet the coffee. Don't shake too hard or tip it around, well, unless you like grounds in your coffee.I leave the Takeya on the counter for the day, swirling it one in a while. At night, I place it in the refrigerator and the next morning I transfer to cold brew to another jar, clean up the Takeya and either make another batch right away or just put it away until the next time. Usually, I start another batch because it doesn't last long.The clean up is pretty quick. I dump most of the grounds directly in the garbage. I know some people use the grounds for other purposes, I don't, but I also don't put them in the garbage disposal. I then clean and dry all the parts with soap and water, rinse, dry and assemble.My observations:1- The extension is sometimes finicky to connect to the filter.2- I'm not sure how sturdy the actual filter fabric is and I treat it very cautiously. Thankfully, it's not an expensive unit and it's made of plastic so it shouldn't shatter.3- Sometimes find a small amount of residue at the bottom, but since I've only been swirling and not shaking, that seems to have mostly gone away. I have had batches with no residue whatsoever. Just gotta be diligent.4- It's actually pretty neat to see the coffee permeate the water over a few hours. I go for about 22-24 hours because I really like my coffee.Highly recommended. Make sure you start with good water and coarse coffee.Update June 2022. I have been using the device every day since I bought it. It's solid and has stood up well. I now brew the coffee for 48 hours. The first 24 hr sees the coffee maker sitting on the counter. It then goes in the fridge for the next 24 hrs. I use very coarse ground coffee from the supermarket. I've tried different roasts and types and I have settled on dark French roast. I fill the maker up to about an inch from the top, put in coffee to fill the basket up to the start of the extension. This works well for me.",

                "reviewText": "This cold brew maker is phenomenal, the instructions however are misleading - do not fill up the entire filter section with coffee grounds, after tons of trial and error I found that filling it 1/3 up gave a great amount of strength and flavor. When I filled it up entirely my coffee turned out extremely bitter and overly strong, keep in mind I only use bold and dark coffee grounds as its the flavor profile I enjoy the most.It is super easy to use, and gives me two cups full of 24oz iced cold brew before I have to refill it! Highly recommend for making your own cold brew at home.",

                "reviewText": "It works. The spout is good. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I consistently use it all the time.Except it leaves coffee grounds in it. They are easy enough to filter out if you rebottle the coffee and use a funnel and coffee filter. They are also easy to leave in the coffee pitcher as they sink to the bottom and you can carefully leave a tiny bit of coffee in the bottom with the grounds.It would be a perfect piece if it kept the ground coffee out completely. That being said, I have never found a cold brew system that keeps coffee grounds completely out. Maybe that is simply the cost of making cold brew at home.The price is right, it works. I am satisfied with my purchase and will use it until the filter fails.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second purchase of a cold brew coffee maker. But not the same as my previous one.The old one I had was made out of glass and unfortunately, it was pretty thin and lasted for a year and a half. It developed a crack near the lid on top. So I decided to get a new one before the crack propagates to the bottom of the glass jug. This was an item with a decent amount of reviews and was ranking 4.5 stars.This item exceeds the previous cold brew maker in terms of rating by the number of reviews and roughly the same ranking.What do I like?It is made out of plastic, but of high quality and should last longerThe lid completely closes the container so there is no chance of spilling.Much quicker to completely soak the coffee grounds all that is needed is to give it a good shake. Most items in this category usually need stirring.Everything just screws on.What I dislikeThe instructions mention if you want to make it more concentrated it is recommended to pull the filter out and drain the remaining liquid into the rest of the concentrate for 45mins. But there is no easy way to do that unless you have a separate container where you can pour the concentrate and for the filter to rest above it.Because this a close and shake cold brew maker would imagine the rubber seal will be the first thing to go. But im sure that can be easily replaced.I have not given a flavour rating as I think it is irrelevant to this item because you're never going to get apple to apple comparison between other individuals who have written a review. But what I will say in comparison to my old one, the ratio between coffee and water seems higher than my previous one which required 1.1L to 80g of coffee. The instructions for this item require around 950ML to 108g of Coffee so it is more concentrated.",
