                "reviewText": "TLDR: for the price of this machine, it makes a fantastic espresso and is absolutely worth it!I was really getting weary of spending $8 at a coffee shop for a tiny drink every time I was craving flat white and was looking for an at home solution. I already had a Nespresso machine at home that I almost never used anymore because I really disliked the taste and the quality of the drinks it could make. However, I was really skeptical about being able to make a decent espresso at home using a machine that wasn't wildly expensive and didn't take up a ton of space, but I decided just to give this a shot.I am so happy I did! This machine allows me to make what I think is a really delicious espresso base (way better than I was expecting!) using my preference of fresh coffee grounds. It is incredibly compact compared to others on the market and it allows me just to get a flavorful shot of espresso without all the bells and whistles or the super high price tag. I can't comment on this being the BEST espresso ever and it might not make the cut for the really serious coffee aficionados, but for me it is a perfect solution. and the taste is 1000x better than anything the Nespresso ever made.HIGHLY recommend if you are thinking about getting a starter espresso machine (or ditching your Nespresso) but don't want to commit to something expensive and complicated. This is simple and effective and I love it.",
