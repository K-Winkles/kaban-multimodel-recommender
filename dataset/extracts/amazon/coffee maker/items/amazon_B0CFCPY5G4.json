                "reviewText": "UPDATE:Seeing a different version of this type of cold brew coffee maker on the Today's Deals page reminded me that I hadn't come back to do the promised update.This product has been in constant use since I bought it. If the dishwasher is about to run anyway, I'll put it in, but otherwise a quick rinse-out is good enough.- It fits easily in the refrigerator door;- Looks nice on the table;- Doesn't slip in the hands, even when wet, and in fact the lack of a handle makes it easier to deal with (and much less likely to get broken);- It's been banged around quite a bit, with no breakage;- I'm using about 2/3 the amount of coffee I used to with a French Press, and get a better result;- The silicone seal is not worn or stressed in any way despite being in constant use.I haven't even looked at our other coffee makers since buying this. It fits the bill perfectly. Absolutely recommend.______Original review:Easy to use, easy to clean, makes better cold brew than our French Press, and table-worthy style. Very glad we purchased this.I do wonder if the silicone seal will wear out at some point due to being switched between the filter insert and the stopper, but there doesn't seem to be any weak point for it to tear so hopefully that won't be a problem.",

We replaced the broken washer and on the second run, it wouldn't work properly, with coffee overflowing on the countertop and floor. The grounds aborb quite a bit the water so you will not get 12 cups of coffee. I can't seem to get more than 8 cups.Our house is under remodel and our contractor threw the box away, otherwise, I'd return this product and purchase something different.",

                "reviewText": "Lovely product with a sleek, modern appearance. It's very easy to use and the coffee that it produces is rich and robust. Despite the instructions saying to fill the chamber with coarsely ground beans, I used preground coffee because it was all I had on hand. I guessed on how much to use. I did not fill the chamber as suggested for the beans. I used twice what I normally would use for a liter of coffee and it came out yummy. the flavor is noticeably different and that says something considering I used the preground coffee. It rinsed out and cleaned up easily. Plus I got two good, tall ice coffees (no ice added, put into insulated, lidded glass) out of one application. This is my new coffee friend, for sure. I can't wait to try it with the coarsely ground beans. I'm sure it's even better. If I were to criticize anything, it would be the need for directions. None were included with my purchases. I had only what was printed on the box to guide me. I'm the type of person who needs more precision. To say \"fill the chamber\" tells me little. I'd like to see specific amounts for both coarsely groung AND preground. Not everyone likes the extra step of grinding beans. Overall, it's terrific!",

I really wanted to love this thing, but it fell really short so I am returning.",
