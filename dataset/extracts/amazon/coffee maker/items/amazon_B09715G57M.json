                "reviewText": "Original post - *with an important new update at the end about Descaling*:So, like all Keurigs, it is convenient and quick to use. I decided I didn\u2019t need any extra features which I never use, so I got this simple little machine even though the water tank is relatively small - it makes three 10 Oz cups before needing a re-fill. I love the small counter-top footprint.What I didn\u2019t know, and have never seen before on any other Keurig I\u2019ve ever purchased, is that it makes a cup of coffee that is, imo, as good tasting as any coffee maker or French press. I waited a few weeks to make sure. I am writing this review because this is the first Keurig that I can drink my coffee black, without creamer, and taste and enjoy the flavor as advertised on the pod.Black coffee. From a Keurig. It\u2019s a first for me, and this little machine \u2026 for some strange reason \u2026 is able to make it very well. Been enjoying it a lot.Update - Descale: the descale light came on after about a month. There is a special procedure that must be followed, which puts the machine in \u201cDescale Mode\u201d, which is this:a: Pour cleaning solution into empty tank (bottled or vinegar/water substitute).b: Place 16oz mug on tray.c: Activate Descale Mode \u2026 Begin with power off (all lights are off); press and hold (unlit) 8oz and 12oz buttons for 3 seconds; the Descale light and 12oz light (only) will begin to flash - this indicates machine is now in descale mode.d: Press the flashing 12oz button - it runs. Repeat until Add Water light illuminates.e: Rinse tank and add water to full.f: Machine is still in Descale Mode (indicated by 12oz light and Descale light still flashing), so press flashing 12oz button and repeat until both flashing lights go out.g: Descale is complete and Descale light is out (yay!).Note 1: This is the only way to get the Descale light to go out.Note 2: Searching the internet for a solution shows the problem is common and the solution is non-existent (Google was worthless). Turns out \u2026 just read the instructions insert (!).",

Customer service wanted me to take a picture of the machine, with my name and the dats, and I did that. After a few days, I got no email or information about the return, so I called again. I was told to take a picture of the machine and my name, AGAIN. Still, no response. I called a third time, and was asked to send the machine back so they can prosses my return. This doesn't work. Kurig was a bad experience for me. Such a hassle, do yourself a favor, get something else.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a good coffee maker, perfect size for my office. Works well and quickly makes coffee. My only complaint is that when the water tank is just below halfway full, the \"Add water\" indicator lights up. At that point, it won't work again until you fill the tank up. Why have such a large tank if you can't use it all?I've tried to contact Keurig support, but they do not answer any questions via email. You have to call their support number. This takes up time going through the troubleshooting process with an agent, only to end up right back where you started. They replaced the tank on mine, but it did not fix the problem and they won't do anything else until I call again. So at this point I'm just going to live with it.",

                "reviewText": "I have probably owned 6 K-cup machines and so far, this one is my favorite! We\u2019ve had an off brand, a Keurig office type, then a few that were good, but not great. This one is my favorite. The strong option isn\u2019t super strong, but stronger than normal which is perfect for us. It brews super fast AND much quieter than any other I\u2019ve ever owned! It\u2019s feels sturdy to use and barely takes up any counter space. I just got it yesterday and we\u2019ve used it at least 10 times already! We use ours for coffee, cider and cocoa. My 14yr old son says his cider tastes better with the strong option. So far, so AWESOME for us! If you\u2019re looking for a k-cup machine, this is the only one out of all the ones I\u2019ve ever owned that I would highly recommend. Plus, it was $30 off the MSRP! I\u2019m tempted to get another and leave it boxed because appliances don\u2019t last forever, but with this one, I will probably be better about maintenance.",

As it would turn out, I just didn't think I liked coffee because I was trying to drink it like everyone else told me THEY like it. I tried it black about a month ago, and have been hooked. This little Keurig has been the perfect machine for me. Makes coffee fast, makes coffee good. It's clean, easy, and I can use the reusable K Cups with it no problem. I don't like that the \"add water\" light comes on when the reservoir is still half full, but that's a minor complaint amongst all of the positives. Highly recommended coffee maker.",

It was cute, compact and made a good cuppa. But it finally wore out. And since I make about 3 cups of tea and coffee per day, I found this perfect 42 oz reservoir that is narrow and deep. So it sits up against a wall and takes up very little counter space. And of course, Keurig makes a great cup of coffee. Unlike some reviews I saw, I have no leaking problems, and no issues with clearing the 'add water' and 'descale' lights. This coffee maker is much sturdier that the Chefman. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

But I love this Keurig K-express and how convenient it is.This is a nice looking machine and it has a narrow design so it does not take up as much counter space as other models. I like that this has a reservoir for water which is different from other mini machines. This makes it much more convenient to use because I don't have to fill it every time I go brew a cup of coffee.This Keurig machine can brew 3 different sizes of coffee, 8 oz, 10 oz and 12 oz, so you can have a stronger or milder brew with just the press of a button.As soon as I put the lid down and selected the size coffee I wanted brewed it immediately began filtering water through my coffee pod and into the cup. This cuts down significantly on the amount of time it takes to brew a cup of coffee.You can fit multiple sizes of cups under the spout in different heights, you can remove the bottom part that catches any spilled coffee and fit a travel mug under it without any issues.This brews a delicious cup of coffee in very little time and is super convenient, a space saver and a nice design. Definitely a great purchase!",
