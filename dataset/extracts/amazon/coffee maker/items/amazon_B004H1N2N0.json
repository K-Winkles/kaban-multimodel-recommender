                "reviewText": "UPDATE (2021):Upgraded to 5 stars because we still use this coffeemaker and still have never had a problem. We've used it anywhere from a few times a month to daily in the past 5 years. I will say that we don't really use the programming functions so I can't speak to the longevity of that feature. We have used it multiple times in the past and it worked fine.It still works great! It still looks great!We've gotten used to the lid coming off every time. It's a minor inconvenience.ORIGINAL (2016):Really like this coffee maker, and I want to love it, but there are a couple small things that prevent it from getting 5 stars. I purchased this refurbished. Not a single problem!PROS:-programmable-great size (not too big a footprint)-stylish-love the gold tone filter (purchased separately)CONS:-the way it's designed makes it hard to pour water into the reservoir-the coffee pot's lid does not flip up, so you keep having to take it off and put it back on",

All the other coffee pots I've tried don't hold a candle to this one, and I hope they keep making it. The only thing I would change is the water tank is hard to fill in the back corner, otherwise, makes coffee with enough speed you are not waiting around for an hour, and feeds water consistently enough through the water basket that it has time to soak the coffee a bit before going into the pot. It has never leaked all over the counter like lots of them do, and the last one I had lasted a very long time. I hope they keep making this model, or at least refurbishing them!",
