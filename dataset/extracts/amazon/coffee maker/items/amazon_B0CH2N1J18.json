                "reviewText": "This is a GREAT machine. It works very well. I got it to use at school (I'm a teacher) to help me stop spending money everyday at the big coffee shops. I am choosing to use it for brew coffee and it works great. As you can see, it comes with 5 reusable filters! You can also use it with K-cups if you want. There are 5 different sizes you can brew--6-14 oz, and a cleaning option.It does have a pretty small water basin--large enough to make about 2 12-14oz cups before needing to refill it, but this comes as part of the slim design it has. It is not tall enough to put a tall cup underneath. The cup shown holds 14oz with a little bit of room. You can take off the bottom drip catcher to add a little bit of room, but not much more. It is very easy to use as well.The cord is only about 2 ft long, which is great for placement on a counter. I am using it behind my desk, so I would like a longer cord, but my use and placement is not typical, I don't imagine, so I think it's great to have a short cord for counter use. It takes about 4 mins to brew a first cup, but that includes heating up the water.All in all, I think this is a great machine with great versatility, and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend the big bucks on the name-brand machine.",

                "reviewText": "Not being a coffee or tea drinker, I needed something for my coffee and tea drinking guests. This was the perfect solution. It offers a 3 in 1 option. It can be used for K cup pods, ground coffee and loose teas. It really comes in handy with the 6 to 14 oz brew size options. They can make their own coffee and it does not take long to make. The self-cleaning function is useful since I prefer not to spend too much time on a coffee maker. An extra bonus is the small sleek footprint. Wish it came in red.",

                "reviewText": "Feels decently high-quality for an off-brand single-serve coffee machine, not like a cheaply produced knockoff but like someone put thought into it. Reasonably intuitive buttons, a good-sized removable water reservoir, easily visible max fill line (which you\u2019d think would be a given, but isn\u2019t), lots of brew size options, and different brew adapters so you can use refillable pods, pre-packaged pods, or put coffee straight in the basket like in a traditional coffee machine. It\u2019s useful that in theory it tells you when it needs cleaning and has a dedicated cleaning cycle, though I haven\u2019t had it long enough to see if the cleaning alert works. It came with lots of reusable coffee pods and was packed safely but minimally, a balance that makes me happy. The manual is also written in readable English, hallelujah!So far we\u2019ve used it with pre-packaged pods for hot chocolate and coffee. It works as expected and doesn\u2019t take up much space on the counter or in a cabinet. My only issues are minor ones. I wish you could directly choose your cup size (instead of cycling through the sizes by pressing the brew size button multiple times), especially since it doesn\u2019t remember your last size setting. It\u2019s slightly noisy (at least, it\u2019s louder than my last, simpler machine), with a high-pitched whirring period right after it finishes brewing. Almost none of our travel mugs will fit into the cup area, but we can pour from a cup to a travel mug if necessary.I\u2019ll update if something goes wrong, but for light use, the machine seems to perform well and I\u2019m currently happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "The Kidisle 3 in 1 coffee maker is a good choice if you want a Keurig-like coffee maker without the Keurig price tag. We recently purchased a Keurig for my husband\u2019s home office, but didn\u2019t want to spend that much again for the kitchen. I normally just use manual brewing methods. I do like having something quicker like this for company, though.Having brewing options and so many cup size options with this coffee maker is great. It\u2019s nice looking and very compact. It doesn\u2019t take up a huge amount of space on my countertop, so I was able to fit it in a small area without having to rearrange anything. Once I received the coffee maker I immediately wanted to try it. I cleaned up the accessories and water basin and ran the water through as the instructions suggested. I tried both methods and they both worked perfectly. The adapters are easy to use and so are the k-cups. My only complaint is that the buttons aren\u2019t as responsive as I\u2019d like. I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019ll learn how best to press them and for how long or with how much force. They eventually work, but I found myself pressing multiple times not knowing if I did it right, hard enough or for long enough. I think I will get used to the buttons eventually. That being said, I think this is a very nice coffee maker and I\u2019m happy I ordered it. At this price (currently $69.99) I doubt you will find a better brewer.",
