This is an honest review. At this point, I would buy just about anything with the name. The attention to every detail is something most miss by a long shot. Not Ninja products. First arrived with a broken carafe which I could hear in the box. I returned it and replaced. 2nd one was like brand new! We had the original Keurig single cup and it was on last legs by the sound of it, but wanted the option to make a pot too. Frothier is an added bonus we will probably never use. Refurbished to the 10th degree and we would never know. If you want an awesome product at about half the price this is it!",

I love that you can choose how much coffee to make. If you're not in the mood for an entire pot, you can have just a cup or even half a pot. It's easily operable & easy to clean. I recommend this over any basic coffee maker.",

I keep getting the \"ADD WATER\" error. I tried troubleshooting according to the manual, even cleaning the unit with water and vinegar as the instructions said. Still in error. So, two days after I received it I initiated a return request, and it gave me a deadline date to return the item. Amazon also issued a replacement order that would be sent out as soon as their system showed I would be sending it back. On the deadline day, before noon, I went to UPS to send the package back. They gave me a receipt with tracking.After I left the UPS facility I looked at my order, and the Reorder DISAPPEARED, as well as any history of the initial return. It's like I received it and never tried to send it back. I am beyond livid. So now I am hoping I get a replacement, but I don't see a replacement order any more, or anything. I am afraid that after its returned I won't see my money back either.",
