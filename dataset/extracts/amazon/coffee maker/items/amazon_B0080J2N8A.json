                "reviewText": "Ok so there are enough reviews on taste, usability etc... so my review is on the dreaded leaking problem you'll see in the reviews and how to fix it. I ordered this for our popup camping since it's exactly what we need. First time we used it (with the lid on) it leaked all over the counter! I was ready to return it but luckily I took a picture of the lid before I cleaned it for the first time. Read on to see about how to fix the leaking (the coffee tasted amazing by the way):1. The gasket. This was my issue. When I cleaned it the first time I removed the clear gasket seated on the lid so it could dry properly. Come to find out I put it back on upside down. Take a look at the picture to see the correct way to seat the gasket. Notice where it's seated and how it flares out at the bottom. Once I fixed that, no more leaks when pouring. The lid must be on and screwed tightly around a couple times until it stops completely and the spout is pointed forward, aligned with the spout on the base.2. The lid must be on. If you try to pour with the lid off it will leak. It's designed to work with the lid on. Not sure why you'd want to use it with the lid off but if that's a real breaker for you don't buy it. Keeping the lid on will help keep the coffee warmer longer (although it still needs to be consumed within about 10 minutes for maximum heat).Follow 1 and 2 above and you shouldn't have any leaking issues. Now for some other observations.- You can pour about 16 oz of Hot water into the top before the water will overflow. That will make about two cups of coffee. Make sure you use the correct amount of coffee for two cups that matches your taste preference. For me that's two heaping tablespoons. If you want more coffee be prepared to wait for it to drain then add more hot water.- The stainless steel keeps the coffee very hot for about 10 minutes. It's not plugged in so of course heat will begin to be lost right way. This is how the world works. We're using this camping so consume the coffee we want right way and make more later if needed. Don't expect this thing to keep coffee piping hot for hours. Buy an electrical until if you need that. Some folks have had good results with putting hot water in there first, dumping, then adding coffee. Since the base is already hot, then yes, less heat will be lost when you pour in the hot coffee.That's it. The rest of the reviewers covered everything else.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Solid pour over coffee maker",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. EDIT after 3 months of ownership, We are still liking this coffee maker, and use it every day. It's fabulous in the camper on mornings when we can hang out with a real ceramic mug and enjoy our coffee.One thing we discovered is that the little hole in the bottom of the funnel is *not* at the bottom, it's slightly up one side. This means that when the coffee stops dripping, there is still a couple ounces of coffee left inside. Pick up the funnel and tilt it toward the hole, then shake a couple of times. (See video.)ORIGINAL REVIEW: We've been doing pour over coffee for years, grinding our beans every morning. At home we used the Melita glass pour over pot, which worked just fine. But we couldn't take it in our camper because, you know, glass. So I got this to take camping, and it immediately replaced the glass carafe unit for home coffee making too.The thermal pot is steel, and keeps coffee very hot for an hour, and hot enough for almost three hours. I am sitting here at 10am, just back from a walk, and poured the last cup. It's not super hot but it's drinkable, and I made this pot at 7am. The thermal pot is very stable, even with the brewing funnel on top, making it much safer in our camper.The one drawback is that it's difficult to pour the last cup as it dribbles out and can make something of a mess. Also, as noted in many other reviews, using the lid is *required* - the carafe won't pour without it. Makes a giant mess.",

                "reviewText": "Lets get the good out of the way first. We'll keep it short.Its metal, so when the cat knocks it over. It wont break.Its a great size and also comes with everything you need to get started.It works as advertised.Coffee stays HOT AS HECK!Now the annoying.Pouring out of it without putting the little top on it is impossible. The notch they ground out isn't deep or long enough so you end up pouring coffee on the counter. This is fixed by just screwing on the lid they give you but its an extra step and sometimes you just wanna pop that filter off and pour a cup ya know? With that said if you're brewing more than a single cup you'll wanna cover it anyways so it works out.The filter top thing. Its fine but I feel like they really boned up the location of the spot it drains. It takes a bit longer than my brain is willing to accept sometimes. Its not a huge deal but coming from a standard has holes all the way around it to this, yeah, its a bit slow. Makes great coffee though.So yeah if you can live with the 2 little things its a great buy. We needed something that wouldn't break next time the cat knocks it over and it hits the mark.",

                "reviewText": "Before buying a read a few reviews saying it did not keep the coffee warm. I decided to try to find out once I had it. I boiled a full pot of water and poured it into the room temp (70F) carafe. I measured the water temperature right away and then over time. The carafe was held at room temperature in still air. Results are below.Initial Temp = 182F60 minutes later = 171F90 minutes later = 164F. At this point I poured out half of the water.120 minutes later = 156F. Still hot enough to enjoy.8 hr later = 105FOverall it looks like this carafe should perform well for most applications and is easy to use. Using it in very cold conditions would likely reduce the time it will keep the coffee hot. Otherwise, it is easy to use and appears to be well made. I would recommend this product base on my initial evaluation and there does not appear to be anything that would reduce usability over time.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this pot because we discovered that paper filters drastically reduce cholesterol. YES, I was surprised to discover this fact too. We were using a French press but it does not have paper filters so the cholesterol in coffee flows straight through. We are currently using recycled bamboo filters and they work well. This product is well made overall, and it keeps the coffee warm for a reasonable amount of time. We use an insulated cozy to extend the time. The stainless steel pot should last a lifetime but the gearing inside the lid to allow pouring is plastic so this will probably wear out first. You have to remove any coffee on the rim before installing the top otherwise it makes a mess on your counter. The funnel part only has a single tiny hole on one side to let the coffee through and it is S L O W. I can't see why they wouldn't have more holes. I may get a drill and add some myself LOL! The spout is tiny and thus also S L O W to pour coffee. EXCELLENT product but just short of perfection.",

                "reviewText": "This set is so nicely designed in some ways. The carafe has a wide enough opening that I can get in there with my hand to clean it with a scrub pad. The filter holder fits very securely on the carafe and it has a feature I didn\u2019t appreciate immediately: the drain hole is just slightly up from the bottom, not at the bottom. Which means it doesn\u2019t continue to drip coffee after you\u2019ve finished the pour over and placed it in the sink. The spout on the carafe does not drip, and the lid screws on correctly without fuss every time.It would be perfect if it also did the one thing I expect of a coffee carafe: keep the coffee hot for four or five hours. But it barely lasts one or two hours for even warm. Do love it for its other attributes, but be prepared to have to microwave your cup of coffee after the first pour .",
