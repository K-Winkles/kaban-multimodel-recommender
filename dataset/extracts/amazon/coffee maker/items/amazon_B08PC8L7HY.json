Why you would need an alarm to let you know it's ready is beyond me. If I make coffee, I want it now and I'm hanging out waiting for it. Actually, every coffee maker I've ever owned has a built in alarm as it loudly sputters when done to get all the water through the machine.That said, this makes greats coffee, the count-down timer on the machine lets you know how many minutes are left until it automatically turns off the heating plate. Easy to set the time and use. Water in the back and coffee in the the front and it uses normal sized round filters. I have always used a mesh plastic and metal round filter in my makers as I find it easier to clean and mine fit perfectly. Very solid construction. My only issue is you need to try and not pour the coffee to your cup to quickly because it can start to pour back along the lip and make a mess. Take your time and its fine.",

Nice that it also has a cleaning feature on it. U am also vision impaired so it is nice that the clock lights up in blue and is easy for me to see. I have it 4 stars though because the water reservoir where you fill up water, the opening is small so I always spill some water trying to pour it in but other than that everything is good.",

Coffee tastes good and stays hot for 2 hours then warmer can be reset. I did notice a little drip when pouring when the pot is very full but if you hold the lid tight, no problem.",

                "reviewText": "After functioning well for a decade, our old B&D coffee maker finally bit the dust. Given we liked the old one, I decided to replace with the same brand, but a slightly upgraded model. I thoroughly read the reviews, and was a bit concerned about those who said it was hard to fill with water and the pour spout didn't work well. But, decided to buy anyway given our good experience with our previous coffee maker. I'm glad I decided to buy it. Day five of using it now, and it's great. Makes a good cup of coffee, it's super quiet, the \"strong\" feature actually does slightly increase the strength of the coffee, and it's attractive on the counter, not taking up a lot of space. I like that it has a \"clean\" function, and the auto timer works perfectly so our coffee is ready when we stumble out of bed every morning.I am also happy to say that any of the negative reviews about filling the water well and pouring the coffee haven't happened to us. I'm unsure why people struggle with these two things, but it's not our experience at all.I highly recommend this machine. Good value and good coffee. We're happy.",

That said, if I had known how difficult it is to pour a cup of coffee, without spilling the contents of the carafe as I pour, I would never have purchased this coffee maker (on July 13, 2022) \u2014 never ever in 100 years! Whoever designed the pouring spout of this carafe was either a newbie engineer, or an outright sadist. Find a better designed coffee maker if you value your nerves.",

                "reviewText": "Don't waste your time or money. I normally like black and decker for their consumer lines. Not this time. When Mr Coffee gave up working right after Christmas, I needed a new machine. Picked this one because it was programmable.Howeve, there is a design flaw that kills the use of this coffee maker. The filter basket fills up too fast, and floods the grinds above the filter, which in turn clogs the spring fed drain into the carafe. Now, if anyone e from B$D is going g to remind me that I need to snap the lid shut, it was every time it was used. I've had this less than two weeks and it never brewed a clean pot of coffee.The problem is in the spring activated drain . I have turned off the machine, numerous times to diagnose this problem opened the lid to see grinds overflow the filter, than close the lid (shaped down into place), only to open it five minutes later, still holding the same water when I turned off the machine. I found I was not putting the normal amount of grinds into the machine in fear of the overflow and yet two things happened. First the brew basket still overflowed, and the coffee was terribly weak. Sorry Black and Decker, this machine fails the coffee test. And, I'm returning it back to Amazon. (0) stars for continued failure to brew a clean regular strength pot of coffee.",
