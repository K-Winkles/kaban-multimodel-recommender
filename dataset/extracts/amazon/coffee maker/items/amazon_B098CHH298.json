                "reviewText": "I've had this coffee maker for about one month and that's enough time to learn all the good and bad things about it. I have to give this coffee maker two thumbs up. I absolutely love it. I've read other comments about how noisey it is or it doesn't keep the coffee hot after brewing, etc, but I have not found those things to be true at all. Mine is quiet, and keeps the coffee plenty hot after brewing. Its easy to clean and I have discovered that if I fill the water to the weep hole in the back, I can get almost 14 cups out of this 12 cup coffee maker. The best part about this coffee maker is it makes very, very good coffee and no spill when you pour it into your cup. I haven't found any bad things about it. It makes great coffee and easy to use, so I don't know what more a person could ask for. I don't know how long this coffee maker will last, but I sure love it. I'm going to buy another one to have as a \"back-up\" when this one gives out just in case this model will no longer be available. Yes sir, this dog will hunt. Y'all take care.One Year Update: I originally purchased this coffee maker in June of 2020 it is now July 2021 and it is still making great coffee without any problems. I'm an avid coffee drinker, so this coffee maker does get a workout. Still operates and performs just as it did the first day of use. Takes about 12 minutes to make a full pot of coffee and still tastes great and works great in all respects. I take care of it and do not abuse it. I clean it when it needs it and always use filtered water. Its wonderful. I have read many reviews, the good and the bad, and I respect all opinions and experiences that are shared, but for me...... all good here. In fact, all is great here. The last coffe maker I had lasted more than 15 years and I would have bought another one of those, but they don't make it anymore. I expect this one to give me many years of service as well. Y'all take care.Two Year Update: July 1, 2022 It's still working great! Works the same as the day I received it. No problems. I'll update again in 2023, y'all take care.Three year update: June1, 2023 I purchased it in June 2020 and its been three years and happy to report that it is working great and I'm having a cup of coffee as i type this. I believe that coffee makers, at least most brands, last a long time if you take care of them. Yes, there are alway going to be exceptions to that rule, but keep them clean and give it a vinegar flush at leat three times per year and as stated earlier, I only use filtered water. I won't be giving anymore yearly updates, but I will update again when, and if, this coffee maker stops working. Hope this review give some insight as to my experience thus far. Y'all take care.",

                "reviewText": "This unit has everything you would expect from a basic coffee maker. I love the flavor of the coffee I make in it. The heating element keeps the brewed coffee hotter than our old one and heats leftover coffee faster. The only issues is lifting the lid will drip condensation down the back of the unit instead of into the water fill area and the carafe is one of those that will drip as you pour if you don't hold it the right way or go too fast.",

Has a strong brew button and cleaning reminder feature, both are added pluses for this model, which replaces my previous B&D coffee maker, and the water tank is very easy to fill. It brews twelve cups in approximately twelve minutes, and keeps the coffee hot for two hours after brewing without the taste being affected. Overall, an awesome product from Black & Decker's line of small appliances!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve never been able to make coffee at home that tastes good. With this coffee maker the coffee tastes great. Smooth tasting, no bitterness. I\u2019ll never buy another cheap off brand coffeemaker again. The coffeemaker does make a difference in the way the coffee tastes.As other reviews stated, the clock is not backlit and condensation does accumulate on it. But these are not deal breakers for me.The no spill feature is great and I like the two hour shutoff because I don\u2019t have to remember to turn it off.This is my first Black & Decker coffeemaker and I hope (expect) it lasts for years. Love this coffeemaker!!",

There is also condensation on the inside - on the lid that lifts up. I'm less worried about that and just find it annoying at times.",

                "reviewText": "Look... I know that this is a coffee maker. I don't drink coffee, but I DO drink a lot of tea. As long as you NEVER make coffee in your coffee maker it will make a nice cup of tea. I just put 2 tea bags in where the filter goes (no filter required) and put in the water like you would for coffee and turn it on. It makes a full 12 cup pot of tea and the warmer keeps it warm. I love the timer. It works well and a lovely cup of tea awaits me when I get up in the morning.I want to elaborate a bit on the \"NEVER make coffee\" comment. If you ever make a pot of coffee you will never be able to clean it well enough to make tea. Your tea will have a stale coffee after taste and you will not be happy. If you have a need for both coffee AND tea, this maker is cost effective enough that you can buy 2; one for coffee and one for tea. Just don't ever mix up which one is which.Excellent buy, brews the full 12 cups in no time.",
