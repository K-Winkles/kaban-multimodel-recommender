                "reviewText": "Updated review, now 5 stars and would give more if I could:The metallic/burning plastic smell from the liner of the water tank did indeed disappate completeley after about 3.5 weeks (longer than Bunn's claimed 1-2 weeks) and we are so glad we stuck with it. Seriously if the thing broke today, I'd pay for same day delivery, instant replacement. Coffee is *perfect* every single time without exception. Flavored, unflavored, regular, decaf...it matters not. Consistent, hot, delicious and done in 2 minutes flat.The other issue with the grounds spewing everywhere was fixed by a promt, free package from Bunn supplying different water flow restrictor sprayheads to pop in. Issue has never recurred. Problem solved.We've had it for 2 years now and haven't really ever done a deep clean on it. We only put filtered water in so build-up is minimal. At first we thought it might be scary having an appliance that is \"on\" and warm all the time, but it isn't. You shut the whole thing down if you're going to be gone for more than 48 hours. The fun part is trying to remember to turn it back on when you return from vacation...it does take several hours to fully warm back up so you're in for a sad surprise in the morning if you forget.We can't live without it._____________________Previous review:Bottom line: I'd give it five stars for the quality and consistency of the coffee it brews but the smell people are complaining about? Yeah, that's real and it is a real problem.But I can only give it three because we are among the unfortunate buyers experiencing the powerful metallic (some call it burning plastic which I understand) smell that has radiated from the stainless steel water tank since the day we set it up three and a half weeks ago. The smell was nauseating at first and headache-inducing. Bunn assures that it goes away after a week or two. It has not. It has dissipated over time, though not to our satisfaction. You can read other reviews about the nature of the smell (an epoxy lining of the water tank that needs to seal before the smell goes away) which is why running vinegar through it does not help...I don't think it is *in* the water tank itself or touching the water, but rather within the lining of the tank.We also experienced the issue with the water and grounds overflowing the first pot we made as so many 1 and 2-star reviewers have noted. It was literally a hot mess that took too long to clean up and was a very disheartening first go with an expensive coffee maker. We ordered the free alternative spray head from Bunn which arrived promptly and solved that problem. (Note: that issue is caused by too-fine coffee grounds/decaf which I assume is because decaf is generally more finely ground than regular coffee. My husband can't have caffeine so we primarily brew decaf).I can't believe we have stuck with it this long, honestly. For the money we spent we would expect perfection from any other product and an industry leader like Bunn should be ashamed of themselves for a sub-par product. Sadly we've now been seduced by the quality and the *consistency* of the coffee it brews each & every time after years of Mr. Coffee makers which make a great pot one day, an awful one the next. We've decided to stick with it and see if the smell truly does go away over time because not enough people have hung in there longer than two weeks to testify to its disappearance. So we're doing it for you--ha ha.We'll keep you posted on the dissipation (or not) of the smell.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Bunn BXB Velocity Brew coffee maker to replace my old 1989 Bunn which started leaking at the bottom. Yes, 1989. My coffee pot was only a few years younger than me and I loved that thing. But, it was leaking so I thought it was done for and ordered this Bunn to replace it.The first two I received were either broken or scratched so I sent them back. The third time was a charm though, because the third one that arrived wasn\u2019t broke, scratched, or had anything else wrong with it that I could tell. Also, no burning smell like other people have had. That\u2019s not normal imo and if you have that problem, I recommend sending it back.We got it set up and so far it\u2019s working as a Bunn should. I would like to note though, that after the initial set up, quite a bit of water kept dripping from the nozzle. I ran another pot of water through and it stopped the dripping. I haven\u2019t had anymore issues with it dripping from the nozzle.If you are new to Bunn you should know\u2026 - These are not like your typical standard coffee makers. I\u2019ve seen a lot of complaints and low ratings in the reviews because some people weren\u2019t quite aware of what they were purchasing. You shouldn\u2019t give bad ratings when the product is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do. Which brings me to my next few points\u2026 - A Bunn coffee maker holds and heats water in the tank 24/7. That is how you have coffee or hot water in 2-3 minutes. I have used a 1989 Bunn for many years. I assure you, it\u2019s safe, and you can leave the house or sleep without unplugging it. The only time we turn it off is when we\u2019re not going to be home for a couple days. As the water heats, it also evaporates, so if you don't use it for several days the water level can get low. - Even though it heats water 24/7 it doesn\u2019t significantly increase the electric bill. To check this, I went to my energy dashboard on FPL and took a look at my daily electric usage since I was without a Bunn for a week while I waited on a new one to come in. There\u2019s no difference in electricity usage during the week I had no Bunn plugged in. - Because it heats the water 24/7, this isn\u2019t the best coffee pot for someone who doesn\u2019t plan to use it every day or every other day. Again, the water will slowly evaporate.Why I love my Bunn\u2026 - I\u2019m not a morning person and I have hot coffee within a couple minutes. It\u2019s super fast compared to your standard coffee maker. - It keeps the water hot but not boiling hot so I can drink my coffee as soon as it\u2019s made. - You get out as much water as you put in. Perfect for when I only need a small amount of hot water.What I use my Bunn for other than coffee\u2026 - Hot water for tea & hot chocolate - Hot water for cleaning - Hot water for cooking (especially bullion cubes or other powdered sauce mixes that need to be mixed with hot water)What I don\u2019t like about my Bunn\u2026 - Emptying out the tank isn\u2019t fun - Cleaning the tank isn\u2019t fun either - Both are much more time consuming than cleaning a standard coffee pot. - With this newer model I don\u2019t like that the nozzle that came with the coffee maker comes out so fast you can\u2019t brew decaf. That\u2019s why people have coffee grounds shooting out of the basket. It\u2019s a huge failure on the company\u2019s part for this even being an issue. I should be able to brew decaf without having to worry about an over flow or spending money on another part. My old Bunn brewed decaf and finely ground coffee with no problems so I expected the same with this one.You can order another nozzle for decaf or more finely ground coffee so the water comes out slower and doesn\u2019t over flow the basket, but that\u2019s the nozzle that should\u2019ve been included with the coffee maker to begin with.Overall, I\u2019m happy with this Bunn so far, though I have zero faith it will last anywhere near as long as my old one. Hopefully, for as much as I paid for this thing, it\u2019ll meet my expectations, but if not I have a backup as I had my husband fix my 1989 Bunn and it\u2019s now back in perfect working condition :)***UPDATE 1/11/18***I planned on doing an update at one year, but our mobile home in the lower Florida Keys got a direct hit from Irma and I was pretty sure my Bunn died. Miraculously, the house and my Bunn survived! The house shook so violently, my microwave was on the floor when I got home, but this guy didn't move an inch! Even the carafe was still in place!Even after all the trauma my poor Bunn went through, it survived the storm. It's still working great and is still in perfect condition. No funny smells and I've never once had an over flow, even when brewing decaf Foldgers. And that's with using the standard nozzle that came with the unit. I also haven't had any issues with the nozzle dripping water when it shouldn't be. Actually, I haven't had any issues. It works perfectly.I have my routine. I pour my water in to brew my coffee. I get my coffee cup, and add the cream and sugar. Stir. By the time I do this, my coffee is usually ready to be poured. Just to give you an idea of how quick this thing is!Also, I know a few people have asked, but my husband and I cannot remember how he fixed my 1989 Bunn from leaking. It's still kicking though :)",
