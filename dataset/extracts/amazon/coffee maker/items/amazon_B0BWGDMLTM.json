                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this coffee maker to replace my old Hamilton Beach one. I love the duo feature. The carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours and it\u2019s nice to have the 2 different adapters for using either store bought pods or using your own coffee. A 12 cup pot of coffee brews in 8-10 minutes and the single cup about 90 seconds. I\u2019ve used the single cup feature to heat water for tea also. The timer was easy to set and also the delay brew time. I would highly recommend this coffee maker. I also purchased a stainless steel permanent coffee filter that works great with this machine.",

                "reviewText": "After reading most of the reviews, good an bad, an many of the asked questions, I \"reluctantly\" ordered this 2-way Flex brewer. It's been over two weeks now, I'm still very impressed!! First thing, was to put all removable parts in the dishwasher, then ran a light vinegar an water thru each side, then 3 times each with just plan water to clean it out good. Had to leave just as the last pot finished, unplugged it an left. 4 1/2 hours later returning home, decided to see how hot the stainless steel insulated craft had keep the water? Let me tell you!!! It was still very \"HOT\"!! OUCH!! It burned my fingers!! It was still almost boiling hot water!! Granted it just had 3 other pots ran thru it, so the craft was already warmed up...As for the single serve K-cup side, I'm also still as impressed, (don't tell H B this, but you can put \"18 oz of water\" in this side without overflowing) I use a regular 16 oz (2 cups) measuring cup to pour water into the reservoir, (because most coffee cups don't pour without dripping an running water down the side). set on Bold, so far coffee has come out just fine. \"Warning! I did however snap the little handle off of the hinged brew basket coffee ground lid holder first time I used it\", my fault, was holding it wrong, still usable, so far have not been able to find the replacement part listed for this yet... Also remember to put a coffee cup on the drip tray!! or you will have a big mess to clean up!! LoL...If asked for a suggestion to make this a better coffee maker, it would be to ad a bigger water reservoir for the single serve side like the Keurig has. You have to ad the water for each cup of coffee you make. Would also make the stainless steel insulated craft a 12 cup size instead of the 10 cup size it is now...",

                "reviewText": "I have finally found a coffee maker that doesn't drip all over the counter when I am pouring a cup of coffee. Kudos for creating a carafe that does not drip when pouring. I also love that I can choose from making a carafe of coffee, using a pod (bonus, the single cup side of coffee maker allows you to keep enough water for 6 or more cups before needing to refill). You also have the option of making a cup of coffee using your own coffee with a single size filter included. This coffee maker is easy to clean and looks attractive on my counter. The convenience of one machine for carafe or single coffee making is really nice. But again, the no drip carafe makes me happy every time I pour a cup. I couldn't be happier.",

                "reviewText": "Update 1/14/24: It was working fine until one day, it broke. Tried to brew a k-cup and the brew light started blinking. There is little to no support or help on that issue. Unplug and plug it back in.... nope. Hold down the button for three to four seconds.... nope. Left it unplugged for 10 minutes that reset it. Then no water pouring into the cup, but it is all over the counter. Water was coming out of the hole where the electrical cable comes out of, yikes! Called for the warranty, Asurion, who told me it's too new they sent me to amazon who told me to talk to Asurion. After a back and forth they confirmed I talked to Asurion and then told me they would take it back for full refund since I got it with a tiny discount they would not replace it. So I have to find a box now and take it to return it and then reorder it for a slightly higher price and I am supposed to get a refund on the Asurion, but last time that happened it was a hassle. So I guess this is a review of a few things.Original:I bought this because our costco keurig special finally died. I wanted a pot of coffee option and the keurig option and this does it. The best thing about this is the option to fill the included reusable keurig pod and the k-cup adapter. The k-cup adapter also holds a reusable k-cup which we find easier to use cause we have filters for it. The problem I have found with the included reusable keurig filter is that it overloads too easy and scrolls a large message across the screen, which is ridiculous it could be easier to read. The coffee pot and keurig side work great otherwise. The only other problem we have had is the clock and brew timer are ridiculously unlike any other clock and time you have ever set. It's not intuitive. It is also ridiculous that you can't program the keurig side to auto brew, should be exactly the same as the pot side. This should be an easy thing for the money spent on this. And remember if you do set auto brew for the pot side and then later go and change it to the keurig side then you need to make sure to take the step to restart the auto brew and flip it back to the pot side, not a big deal but still stupid. If both sides were programmable one at a time then sure I get why I would have to make sure to switch it back, it should reset itself if it was already on. Why not one reservoir and choose how much coffee the pot makes? The reservoir for the keurig is easy to fill but the lid falls off easy. The coffee pot side reservoir is hard to fill like every other coffee maker in existence and the water levels are impossible to see without good light and being able to see over the top of the coffee maker. I'm six foot and still cant quit make out all the steps. We have the metal coffee pot, its nice, it does hold the heat, I don't have to worry about a pot of coffee sitting on a hot plate. The coffee pot is a pain to pour the last bits out of. There should not be a lip where there is a lip the design could be better. The coffee pot side holds the steam in pretty good but the keurig side is a steam engine. We just put out the whole thing from under the cabinets regardless, no one needs mold. Overall its a good machine so far and it better last 10 years. Buy a used/refurbished if you can save some money unless you want the extended warranty that was not offered when we tried to purchase the used one. This is why we went with the new one, otherwise I would not have minded a returned item in good condition.",
