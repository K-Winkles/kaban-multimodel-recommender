                "reviewText": "Huh, mixed reviews. Well, I have NO issues with this brewer. From start to finish, no issues.--Plug in.--I fill the reservoir to the max (5 cups) with cold water--I add 5 TBS of ground coffee to the filter basket.--Make sure drip is over the coffee--Turn on via simple ON/OFF switch--Brews quickly.--POURING? no problem. Never ever a spill or dribble. EVER.--5 cups fills a couple of mugs. I dont let the coffee sit on the burner as there is no warming option (nor expected one on this size coffee maker).--Filter basket is easy to clean. I tap the spent grounds on side of garbage can, then run the filter under faucet to clear out rest. Easy peasy. Could use a paper filter if that seems complicated.--Maybe make another pot if I need it :), or I store it away until next time. I happen to have a Kcup machine, capsule machine, French press, pour over brewers, a large capacity drip brewer, and this 5 cupper. I dont have everything sitting out. I tend to grab for a kcup or for this small brewer. Just works for me.Glad I bought this. I was in the mood for drip brewed coffee, and didnt want to use my 12 cupper. My old 5 cupper was long gone, so I decided to just order this. At sub $20 I thought it a reasonable purchase. Lately I have only been making drip coffee in this, and it has been wonderful. Nice to use up some bags of coffee that I had been ignoring.",

                "reviewText": "The Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 Automatic Brew & Drip Coffee Maker takes the morning coffee routine to new heights. Despite its small stature, this sleek and efficient coffee maker boasts a range of features that make it a standout addition to any kitchen.One of my favorite aspects is the Pause N Serve feature. It allows me to sneak a cup of coffee mid-brew without any mess. Perfect for those moments when I just can't wait for the entire pot to finish. The water level indicator is a thoughtful touch that takes the guesswork out of brewing. It's easy to see when it's time to refill, preventing any mishaps and ensuring a consistent brew strength. The simple On/Off switch makes operation a breeze. It's intuitive and easy to use, and the light is especially helpful for those dark early mornings when functionality is key. I purchased this coffee maker for its sleek compact design to fit on my countertop without taking up precious space.One recommended improvement would be to design the carafe so it doesn't spill over no matter how fast or slow you pour the joe into your mug. Another improvement would be to have a retractable cord to round out the powerhouse of features this little coffee champion provides.Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "This review is based on one week's usage--take that for what its worth. It is effective, it heats the water and passes it through the ground coffee beans in the filter. The filter is nice; no paper filter needed. It is as advertised--a basic, functioning water heating device.One drawback is the lack of auto shutoff. While it is sold as a \"feature\": \"no special programming or settings to complicate the coffee maker function\". Right. It is so simple it doesn't shut off by itself. Understand that, and you should be very happy with this purchase. Go to bed forgetting to shut it off and the pic is what you'll wake up to.I purchased this to travel out of town for a couple of weeks and it is well worth the money for that purpose.",

Easy to use and clean, but very delicate and requires gentle handling. The black coating on the warming plate is already coming up in places after only two uses. That said, would recommend it for occasional use.",
