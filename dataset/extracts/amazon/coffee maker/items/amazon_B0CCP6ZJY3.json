                "reviewText": "I owned a single serve coffee maker bought from Amazon a number of years ago. It was just fine, but stopped working. It is not on Amazon offerings any more. This Teglu looked very similar. NOT!When the coffee is dispensed, drops of coffee jump out of the cup/mug onto the counter. The part which makes hole in bottom of K cup is way off to the side, and sometimes does not function correctly, causing hot steam and coffee grounds to blow up and spew, as described by another reviewer. The grate which the cup or mug sits on does not have any reservoir space under it to catch any overflow! Why a grate that has plastic flat against it? I am returning, and ordering a different coffee machine today.",
