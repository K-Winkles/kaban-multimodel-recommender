I have a vertuo machine and a Nespresso original machine and one bottle of this was good enough to descale both machines at one time. I previously had only tried the Nespresso solution and still felt my older vertuo machine was always still a bit foggy in color when it brewed water. After descaling with this Impresa solution, I\u2019d never seen it drain such clear water. This was only my second time descaling my almost 1yr old Creatista machine and as you can see in my video, the water brewing after a descaling with Impresa was super clear and clean enough to use for tea. Will continue to buy this instead of the Nespresso brand. It\u2019s convenient and so far better!",

I followed the directions, and my coffee maker was good as new! No more issues with water intake, the machine cutting off, or my coffee tasting funny. Definitely recommend!",

Very happy this product is American made. The one thing I do not like is there is no list of ingedients. It states may be harmful if swallowed but does not say ANYTHING about what it is made of. Was delivered by US Mail a day late and left on our step in the rain. The person could have placed it a couple of feet farther under the porch (just lazy I guess).",

Then I proceeded to the usual descaling routine. And after 10 or 15 min my coffe machine was back in service.With this 2 bottle pack, I can perform up to 4 descalings for my coffee machine, making it a cost-effective and convenient solution for maintenance. This not only ensures the optimal performance of my coffee machine but also extends its lifespan.Since using this descaling solution, my coffee machine is back to working as flawlessly as it did when I first bought it. The blinking yellow light is now a reminder of the effective maintenance routine rather than a cause for concern. I am genuinely satisfied with the results, and I highly recommend this descaling solution. It's a small investment that pays off in keeping your machine running smoothly and your coffee consistently delicious. Cheers to hassle-free maintenance!",
