                "reviewText": "This cold brew coffee maker is aesthetically pleasing to me, and the components seem to be well made. The lid fits snugly, ensuring your precious brew stays fresh and will not leak (I had no issues removing the lid, or filter tube like other reviews have mentioned, just remember to pull the plug out of the spout). The lid gasket is BPA free.The vessel itself is borosilicate glass, shaped like a beaker from middle school chemistry class, and while the descriptions says it is \"thick and strong\" I have my reservations about ever putting it in the dishwasher. It feels somewhat fragile to me, especially the handle. I would be wary of picking up and pouring out of a full vessel with only one hand. Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but I'm just saying the handle could be a bit thicker.The instructions are pretty vague, but it's a cold brew coffee maker, pretty straightforward. Put some water in the brewer, add coffee (I like to use a course grind), add more water until it's full. Place in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours (I like to let it do its brewing magic in the fridge for closer to 24 hours so it's nice and strong). Remove filter tube (this is optional, but I prefer to remove it after I deem it ready to consume). Pour and enjoy!It even comes with a foam cleaning brush, particularly helpful if you have large hands.As far as value, I think the price at the time I ordered it is a bit steep. There are other cold brew coffee makers on the market for much less, but perhaps they are of inferior quality. I will update this review after several uses and report how it is holding up, if my ham fisted self doesn't break it by then:)",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited when I found this online, and even more excited when I received it! I make cold brew coffee in a large batch and drink it over a couple days. Yes, I know the taste is best when fresh but free time in my life is very hard to come by so I have to cut corners with time where possible. It's quite hard to find a large (64oz) cold brew maker - even harder to find one made with a very well thought out, functional design and good materials.Over the months I've used it I've continued to be impressed. It brews well, the infuser/filter is surprisingly easy to clean even though it is so long (you'll want a long handled brush if you use this for loose leaf tea, as some of that is a bit harder to clean out than coffee grounds), the lid seals especially well and finally - the rubber cap for the pour spout was a really classy touch to keep anything from flying in during brewing, and keep odors out during fridge storage.Now down to my only concern/issue... the borosilicate glass seems a bit thin. I was a little concerned when I received it that it would break just with normal use, putting it down on the granite countertop, etc. However, over the time I've had it that has not happened, and I have to assume that they avoided making it too thick both for cost savings as well as keeping the item from becoming too heavy when empty.While it did not break as I feared, from touching a table, countertop or glass fridge shelf with too much force - it did break. I'm very unhappy to report that the glass \"weld\" (not sure what you call how this handle is attached?) cracked. I noticed it when picking up from the counter after an 18 hour cold brew session, so as far as I know it didn't happen from any particular force or hit on anything.I wasn't able to find anything regarding warranty on the sale page on Amazon, nor the seller page (Perjoy), nor any way to contact them. The option to contact the seller can often be found when reviewing your order within Amazon, but there is nothing shown there except \"Review Your Purchase\". I'm going to have to give this a 3 star rating for now, based on the short time I was able to use it before it broke. If there is a warranty or some kind of support, that star rating could certainly go up at a later date.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love iced coffee and I've used a few different cold brew coffee makers in the past, including the wonderful Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Pot, though it was too small for my liking. This Perjoy Cold Brew Coffee Maker, 68oz Cold Brew Pitcher with Stainless Steel Super Dense Filter, works very well. I especially like that is it leakproof and accommodates a lot of coffee. And the cold brew is delicious!Many reviewers have stated that the top is hard to get off. And when I first tried it, it almost seemed impossible. But it's much easier than you think. Just watch the video on the Amazon page next to the product description. Easy peasy!I really love the BPA-free silicone seal and thick and durable glass. And just watch my video to see how leak-proof this cold brew carafe is!Some reviewers complained about the grounds being dry and the coffee grounds in the carafe. However, you need to fill the carafe part way, insert the seal with COURSE-ground coffee beans, and then pour water on the rest of the grounds. And if you watch my video, all you have to do is hold it upside-down or lie it on its side in the fridge and the water will saturate the coffee grounds.I think in my video I said to leave it in the fridge 12-18 hours. It actually tastes better after 2 days, but that's personal preference.The only thing that worried me was the thinness of the stainless steel filter, but it's held up fine and it allows the water to saturate the coffee grounds. Just be careful when cleaning it. That said, it comes with a handy brush.I highly recommend this Perjoy Cold Brew Coffee Maker - just remember to read/watch the instructions!",
