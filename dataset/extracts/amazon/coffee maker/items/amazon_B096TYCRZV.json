Very poorly thought out, in our high tech digital world no less.To set the automatic brew, which in and of itself is an oxymoron, and for which most makers will tend to be rather self explanatory. Not here; Braun makes you earn that cup-o-jo. It's not a - once and you're good until the next power outage resets it to default, oh no, you set this each and every night (or day respectively, whatever you're routine). It's a very odd sequence of pannel inputs, not unlike the kind used on nuclear missile consoles I'm guessing.I don't write bad reviews as a sort of twisted form of relaxation; I knew this was a cheap deal when I ordered it. I \"rolled the old dice.\" I now look forward to its end-of-life (or scheduled obsolescence) so I can drop some coin on my go-to brand. It has one big knob you turn and set everything, including your water's hardness. Now that is progress. Braun can't do that?Oh, you're curious \"how does the coffee taste?\" ... like everyday, ordinary coffee, no frills... this maker will not \"wow\" you.So, if you're short on cash, need a coffee maker for guests, or your office, you're not picky, you don't touch the stuff, or just like a routine evening's coordination challenge of setting the auto brew (all but automatic), this baby is for you!!!",

My first coffee maker (many decades ago) was a Braun - remember the white one with only one button, the On/Off switch? Since then I\u2019ve had mainly Cuisinart or similar brands. I found them difficult to fill, with timers/clocks that were almost impossible to read. So when I went looking for a new coffee maker I thought I would go back to Braun. And I am so glad I did.This unit looks great, is easy to fill, has a clock that is lighted and easily visible, and it makes great coffee! The pot is perfect too - hinged lid, and pours beautifully. No splashing or dribbling like most glass coffee pots I\u2019ve used.While the settings are a little tricky at first, once the temperature and time are set, it\u2019s easy from there. Power button, brew level (Fast, Regular or Strong) and you\u2019re all set.I would definitely buy another one of these, and I\u2019m looking forward to many years of great morning coffee with this one.",
