I bought this small one cup coffee brewer for a friend of mine that is in the nursing home for her guest to brew a cup of coffee while they visiting her or I cab brew her a cup of coffee whenever she wants one it works great I have no problems with this coffee brewer it is good for an 8 oz cup of coffeeThe only downfall I have with this coffee maker is it says 6 8 10 or 12 oz it's too short for a 10-ounce so I use an 8 oz cup and the markings are inside the water reservoir that's hard to see but if you shine a flashlight in it you can see it but once you figure out how much coffee you need to put in your filter or what type of K-Cup you going to use you know by the first time how much water to put in for your 8 oz cup it makes a good tasting cup of coffee it's well worth the money and I recommend people to buy it if they want to have a little cup of coffee while they're watching a late show or what have you but if you're a coffee drinker not like me I just drink one cup of coffee every morning but if your a coffee drinker you have to have several cups I don't recommend you to buy it like I said it's just for an 8 oz cup of coffee it works very well like I said and I do recommend buying it it's well worth the money",

                "reviewText": "So, there are three PROs for this brewer:1) It makes your coffee FAST.2) It's relatively easy to clean.3) It's very easy to use.Now for the CONs:1) Coffee isn't the hottest - after 10 minutes in a well-insulated mug it's already cooled down significantly. I drink my coffee over a 30-minute period, and I usually have to heat it up twice.2) Coffee doesn't taste good. It's weak, and there are usually some grounds at the bottom of my cup. I think it brews it TOO fast, so the grounds aren't given enough time to steep. I'm using the same batch of K-cups from my last brewer (that died), so it's not the cups themselves.3) Product is cheaply made. The plastic on this brewer is definitely of a much inferior quality to my last brewer (Sboly single-cup brewer, about $15 more than this one). It's thinner, and just doesn't feel like a quality product. It weighs *nothing*, like I can dangle it off of my index finger easier than one of my coffee mugs.4) Not much room for a good-sized mug. I can't use any of my larger mugs in this - the largest that fits is a 12-oz. The platform the mug sits on is really high and the cup vessel is really low, so you've got only 5\" for your mug. I usually brew 11 oz. and add creamer, so this is an issue. I brew it in my 12-oz mug, then have to pour it in another to add creamer so it doesn't overflow the mug when I tip it to drink.5) They give you a rubber drip tray that sits on top of the platform but it's useless. It's pretty thick for starters, so I can't use it with the mug (because the mug won't fit) and it hardly holds any spill over (my last brewer held up to 6 oz) because it's pretty much solid with a few grooves.6) It sounds like it's going to take off from my kitchen counter. It's pretty...forceful. And I think that's part of the reason I'm getting grounds in my coffee: it's trying to blast through so quickly to get you the coffee fast that it's just not brewing correctly and taking grounds along for the ride.Overall, I'm sorry I bought it as it was a waste of my money. It works, but not well. I've got coffee, but I don't enjoy drinking it. While it fits on my limited counter space, it doesn't fit most of my mugs. :(",

                "reviewText": "Great little coffee maker. Perfect for a one cup a day. No mess! I have a much larger Keurig which I have loved for many years, but I don\u2019t really need the size. They both have one cup convenience, but the mixpresso is so nice and small. I got it for the motorhome, but I may get another for home. It\u2019s my 3rd one for motorhome. Most of the smaller one cup machines are larger than this one, cheaply made and don\u2019t last. This Mixpresso seems to be of higher quality right out of the box. Beware: I have several of the taller and narrower coffee mugs and some do not fit. The tallest cup you can have is about 4 3/4 \u201c, but you can add about a half inch if you take the bottom tray out. Won\u2019t fit the taller travel mugs. Also, It is louder than I like as its heating the water. I can live with that, given the overall quality!It is solid and well built. I\u2019ve timed it twice, and it took about 3 1/2 minutes to heat water and make a cup of hot water for first rinse and test. It took under 3 min for next cup with coffee......Probably because it was warmed up! Overall, if you\u2019re looking for small, convenient, single cup brewing, this is your machine.",

Well, a 5\" cup will fit, but don't fill it all the way because you'll need to tip it to remove it.",
