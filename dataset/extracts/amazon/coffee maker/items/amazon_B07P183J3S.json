                "reviewText": "I spent a month checking out single serve coffee makers...it was impossible to find what I was looking for. I was really surprised, and only the Casara coffee maker checked every box.I wanted one that makes coffee very hot, a small footprint, great tasting coffee and very important, a timer! Nothing like waking up to the smell of fresh coffee!I had never heard of this brand and was a bit skeptical. However, although I have only had it two days, it has surpassed my expectations. The unit is very simple to use, efficient, and makes very great coffee. I usually make my coffee in a funnel pouring water slowly over it...that technique makes excellent coffee? However, I wanted a cup to be waiting for me when I woke up...this was the perfect unit.Also, the cup that comes with it works extremely well. It stays cool on the outside and the coffee is hot when I drink it. The only downside is if you turn this cup upside down it leaks a little from the cover. Since I never hold my cup upside down when I am drinking, this small issue has not affected me, but you should be aware of it.As I have only had the coffee maker 2 days, I will update my review if anything relevant happens. Try it, I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed. Oh, did I mention it is very easy to clean?!",

                "reviewText": "This is perfect for me. It's very easy to use and program. I drink tea. I don't drink coffee (at all) and I certainly don't need a whole pot of it. I need a single cup only. I drink high caffeine (Zest brand) tea instead. It's cheaper to buy the loose leaf tea than the sachets, so I needed a single cup brewer. This fits the bill.I set this up so it will turn on and brew my cup 5 minutes before my alarm wakes me. As soon as I walk into the kitchen, my tea is ready for me. This comes with a scoop that's just the right size for my tea and the mesh filter doesn't let any tea leaves past. It also comes with an insulated cup.",

                "reviewText": "First off, for the price paid (~ $28 + tax), this is an excellent value in single-serve coffee makers. I'm retired, so I don't use the programmable feature, but I can see how that would be very handy for early risers that want their coffee as soon as they awake. I also don't use the travel mug (same reason), but it would be a great feature for grab-and-go morning commuters. The unit comes with a reusable mesh filter that does a good job in bringing the flavor out, but it allows too much sediment/sludge to accumulate at the bottom of the coffee mug. Something which I cannot tolerate--I'm a clean coffee person.The manufacturer's instructions note that you cannot use a disposable paper coffee filter. I experimented with various types and found that if you carefully fold a Melitta Junior basket filter (4-6 cup size) into the plastic filter folder, it works quite well without collapsing during the brewing process. My only negative regarding this unit is that the plastic used in the construction seems a bit flimsy and scratches quite easily. However, this doesn't seem to negatively affect the finished cup of coffee, so I gave it an overall 4.0 rating. The temperature of the coffee produced is also top notch--much warmer than other small coffee makers I've tried. You can also use this coffee maker to make iced coffee if you're careful. Just use less water (8-10 oz) and a bit more coffee grounds to allow for the ice cubes to melt during the brewing process. Neat!",

Then this Wirsh one cup (14 OZ) coffee maker is the perfect choice. I've owned mine for over 6 months now and it has never faulted once in giving me wonderfully delicious coffee - every morning! It is programmable so your coffee can be ready when YOU want it, any time. It's slender so it takes up very little room on your kitchen countertop, it's sturdy, the display is easy to read, and it's so easy to clean and care for... I should know! The price is excellent because for me it's worth every penny to have my coffee ready when and the way I want it.My onIy problem was with the drinking cup top. The day that I emailed Wirsh Customer Service about it, I received a quick response of concern in wanting to rectify the situation as soon as possible - and boy did they ever! Am I Pleased? Of course, who wouldn't be? Will I continue to purchase Wirsh products? Absolutely!",

                "reviewText": "Used to make coffee at the office coffee maker (for all employees), but with CovId-19 situation, working from home. Only drink one cup, and only in the morning, and only during work days Mon-Fri. (Well, usually only one cup, but sometimes if I had an extra glass of wine the night before, I will brew a second cup!) Researched several one-cup coffee makers, including some popular coffee pods units. Was determined to get that convenient and popular pods unit, but I kinda like coffee a little stronger and wasn't sure if possible with those pod units. Had decided on another maker, costing more than twice as much, but gave this Casara a try. Conclusion, love it. Easy to use, does the job, nice hot one-cup every morning (most of the time). And I can adjust the taste/strength accordingly, depending on how much grounds to put in filter. Even though description of Casara use doesn't require a filter, I ordered a couple of hundred junior filters as other reviewers indicated. (I've tried both ways, and the included reusable filter is fine. However, prefer the using the paper filter since it's easy to clean. Just dump the used filer and grounds in waist basket, as oppose to cleaning the factory filter after every use.Someone mentioned that the Casara is loud. Well, I agree. But seriously, a coffee maker is loud? Yeah, it is not quiet for sure, but only towards the end of the brewing process. At the end of brewing, it starts huffing and puffing, and exhaling really dramatically. Really!!! I used to get a kick of it, reasoning that its trying its hardest to please, to get all my coffee brewed, for my morning kick start. But now, I'm used to it. Still, I get a kick out of it.",
