It's easy to make espresso in this machine too. We haven't cleaned it yet but I don't foresee any problems. At first I was taken aback a bit of having to take the tight fitting lid off to fill the pot with water, instead of just flipping the lid up. We also think it was confusing to turn the pot off, but have figured it out. Watching a You Tube video for this specific brand helped.",

(Which also steams milk, etc. with a turn of the button.) Want a quick cup of pick-me-up espresso? Use the single serve function and your choice of Nespresso originals. Want to brew a cup of tea with those tasty loose teas in your cupboard that you never brew because you don't want to have to clean the tea strainer? Use a Fanativita Disposable Coffee Filter for K-Carafe with a Cuisinart SS-RFC HomeBarista Reusable Filter Cup and all you'll do is pull the biodegradable/compostable paper filter out and toss it or recycle. I highly recommend this Barista system and also the two other products I mention above. They will add pleasure and convenience to your daily routine. By the way, my husband just loves that he can have hot cocoa any morning he wants it....even if we're out of milk. :) (I also got the delicious Starbucks hot cocoa K-Cup Pods.) Little treats to share and enjoy can make your day!",

                "reviewText": "This machine works great for coffee, the steam wand is not something to be desired. It takes a while to heat the milk and doesn't create much foam, it is just OK. It is very nice to be able to use Keurig pods and nespresso pods, and regular brewed coffee. We use each option often. Because of the lack of performance of the steam wand I use a separate frother.",

                "reviewText": "I can't tell you how many coffee makers I've had over time looking to brew the best cup of strong coffee (Starbucks is my benchmark). Normally I'll find 2 out of the 3 things I'm looking for in a coffee maker, but this new Cuisinart 4 in 1 checks all my boxes. I like the fact that I can brew an expresso, or a travel mug with a K cup, hot water for tea or a full pot of rich strong coffee. The ONLY downside is when taking the K cups or Expresso pods out of the coffee maker, they tend to leak. I'd most definitely work on that. This Cuisinart does it all and with the quality expected from Cuisinart. This one gets two thumbs up from me. If you are a coffee snob like me, it's worth the price of admission.",

(Follow the manual.) We have made pots of coffee, K-cups, and Nespresso original capsules. We are mostly using the individual serve coffee features (I like K-cups and wife likes Nespresso.) We have not used the steam wand. No problems so far. Glad we purchased this coffee maker.",
