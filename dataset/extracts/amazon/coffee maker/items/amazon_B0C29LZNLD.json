                "reviewText": "I ordered originally from Amazon, but I had to return since their shipment was late and I had to buy it locally. I'm sure Amazon is having an uptake on packages at this time of the year.But, the coffee machine is so great I wanted to be sure to write a review. have purchased so many different Keurig coffee makers I can't count the number. But I have never been satisfied. This Ninja is so far way superior. First, the size is nice to put on the counter. Low profile and pretty. I was so very impressed with the number of things it does. First and foremost we use so much coffee I had to have one that would let me use a REFILLABLE POD: IT DOES! ) BE SURE YOU USE THE REFILLABLE THAT ONLY HAS ONE HOLE IN THE TOP. This little coffee maker is loaded with good features--classic coffee, rich, specialty (4 oz) and on and on. I love the \"froth\" feature and use it every day (I snickered when I first saw it and said not for me--I was wrong.) It has a large water reservoir and can make coffee from 4 oz+. Before purchase read the description--you will be amazed. ALL THAT FOR $79. It makes coffee quickly and it is quite hot. Just what I wanted. I am mentioning about the pod because when I was researching before purchase some one had written it would not accept refillable pods. I bought it anyway just to see and was presently surprised that it did accept them as long as it is the one hole on top refillable. So glad I stumbled on it. Really love this machine. We are a two person household coffee drinkers so that might play into this one or their next step up machine. For for two old souls who just wants coffee quickly in the morning we are happy.",

                "reviewText": "Update 2/3/2024: I mentioned below I use 'ground' coffee instead of using K-cups. I now have to admit the Ninja coffee maker is not good, in my opinion, with this option. Using the individual K-cups it works as it should. But, using 'grounds' is proving to be quite messy and one must use 'more' grounds than what you would need in the \"K\" brand of maker. It is still a choice I would make because the \"K\" brand has been dismal but admittedly I am disappointed that the 'grounds' option is not a good option.I have been using the \"K\" brand of single serve coffee makers for MANY years. They 'used' to be a decent product. The last two(2) not so much.....the last one definitely NOT Good. Soooooo, decided to try another Brand/Maker of this type of appliance. \"Ninja\" has been around for a while so decided to go with a 'name/brand' that was a KNOWN brand. 1. Coffee machine is a nice looking. 2. the adjustable tray is a nice gimick. Being able to adjust it up and down depending on size of mug might just aleaviate some of the splashing? 3. Set up was very easy. 4. The ability to choose a 'stronger' brew is nice. 5:Negative....but a minor one. I choose to use 'grounds' and not the premade K-cups. This machine is capable of doing this. But the 'basket' is kinda large and so it takes more grounds than what my \"K\" machine did. It brews it fine and tastes good but to get the 'strong' brew one needs to use a bit more grounds than what the \"K\" machine slender 'basket' took. Like I said a 'minor' negative. I hope to get years of use from this machine; time will tell. Yes, I recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a machine that could use pods, ground coffee or even make tea, well this machine can.We have a bean to cup all singing and dancing coffee machine from a well known Italian brand but I sometimes like to use flavoured ground coffees and my other half always complains they taint the taste of his Cappuccino even after a rinse cycle.So I decided to get a machine that could use ground coffee and pods as well, because why not? This does all that and more.It is a good sturdy feeling machine, everything clips into place with a satisfying click and nothing feels like it might snap if you are not gentle with it.It's compact with a narrow footprint so doesn't take up much space but has a good sized water tank. It has 2 interchangeable holders for either pods or tea/coffee and the spare stores neatly in it's own drawer on the machine when not in use, switching them out is really simple. There is a scoop that clips in on the side for measuring ground coffee or loose tea and on the other side is a built in milk frother for when the frothy coffee mood takes you. It does everything I could possibly want, does it super fast and is easy to clean.There is no auto self clean cycle and the setting for cleaning is actually a full decalc cycle but you can either pour water in the pod holder with a cup under to rinse it through or what I normally do is just set it to a 6 oz brew cycle with no pod or coffee in just to rinse everything out before switching it off.I'm so glad I bought this model, it's perfect for my needs and so simple and intuitive to use. I've already recommended it to everyone I know",

                "reviewText": "yo compre la version color beich pensando que la unica diferencia entre la beich y la de color negro era la maquina para hacer espuma, pero resulto que la de color beich no trae una funcion llamada \u00a8SPECIALTY 4 oz\u00a8, que es la que te permite hacer los shots para los lattes y capuchinos.Asi que si piensas comprar una de estas dos versiones recomiendo la que tiene la maquina para hacer espuma por su funcion extra y la diferencia en precios es minima. para que puedan sacarle mayor provecho a la cafetera.En conclusionLa de color beich funciona excelente y la recomiendo bastante, pero si pudiera comprarla otra vez compraria la de color negro con la funcion especial para capuchinos y lattes.",

It is beyond me as to why Ninja would sell ANY of their coffee makers on the Amazon UK site when they come with AMERICAN PLUGS! There is no mention of this in the listing anywhere. Selling a product no one can use\u2026.what is even the point. Don\u2019t let the reviews fool you, they are all from the Amazon US site just plastered on this UK posting to make it look good. Ninja makes great machines but not for users in the UK. Also, Amazon Customer Service is absolutely worthless. They said this machine could be used with a power adapter. It CANNOT. If you live in the UK and you need a very large paper weight, this is the right product for you.",
