It comes in several different colors. I got the blue and love it.It's hard to find a coffee maker that is this small, I looked everywhere. Most of them are big and would take up a lot of counter space. It's a very good product for the price.",

It is made of a thin plastic and at first seems insubstantial and fragile. It does have what I have looked for and what is important to me - no stainless steel. I live less than a mile from the Atlantic ocean and even less distance from a large bay: stainless steel rusts here - always. The coffee maker is efficient and takes up little counter space. The coffee comes out fast and hot and stays hot for the hour or so I leave it. I love the color - red. It takes up little room. I don't think the taste of coffee has anything to do with a drip machine so I can't rate that. I do think I will come to really love it: for now, it fits my needs.",

I went back to my unbleached brown coffee filter and used my own scoop.......and coffee came out great. Love the Color......matches what I have in my kitchen. And it again is fast & quiet. Some complained about it being cheap plastic.......I didn't find this.......it was the same as my Mr. Coffee Maker. M.C. noisy and grounds got into the area where you poor in the water....a pain to clean. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this item because 1) I wanted a coffee maker that made more than 2 1/2 cups of coffee and 2) it was the perfect teal color. But it is NOT as advertised. It will barely make 3 cups. The carafe holds 25 ounces (740 ml) ofwater. A cup, here in the good old USA, is 8 ounces. Let's do the math. 8 ounces x 5 equals 40 ounces (1183 ml). So how does a 25 ounce carafe make 5 cups? The answer is it doesn't. It makes barely 3 cups when you allow for the water absorbed by the coffee grinds. It makes 5 just-over-a-HALF cup servings. Personally, I don't do half cup servings, and I don't know anyone who does. I hate it when merchants flat out lie in their ads. Or maybe Chinese cups are 5 ounces? Whatever the case, if you want a 5 cup coffee maker this is not it. You might try Krupps. I have a 4 cup Krupps coffee maker. It's old, but still works. It measures a cup as 8 ounces. It makes 4 cups (2 1/2 mugs). Four 8 ounce cups. The Krupps carafe is larger than this one, which claims to make 5. So much for truth in advertising. I hate to return it because it is so pretty, but I wanted a bigger coffee pot, not a smaller one. So another merchant lies and now I have to trek all the way to the Post Office in the next town to return this thing. There should be a law against this kind of thing. Oh, wait, there is. Amazon just doesn't enforce it.",

I've used some of the small pot Mr. Coffee makers for a while now, but found this one on sale on Amazon and figured I'd give it a try. I wish I hadn't.It takes quite a bit longer (a difference of several minutes) to brew the same amount of coffee.It doesn't have an auto shut-off for the heating element/plate either. I'm notoriously forgetful, and it's nice to have the added safety of an auto-off heating plate - this doesn't have one.I just can't get my coffee to taste right out of it either. I've had it now for a couple of months. I followed the initial cleaning instructions. I have since made sure to keep the coffee pot clean, periodically do a deep clean on the reusable filter and basket, use cold filtered water, etc. I'm using the exact same coffee as usual and in the same amounts as well. Somehow, my coffee just isn't as good. It's almost burnt in aroma, and more bitter in taste.Lastly, I can't manage to pour out of the pot without getting water or coffee all over the place. I try to pour slowly, or quickly, or somewhere in the middle, and almost every time I manage to get the liquid within running down the side of the pot and onto the counter instead of into my mug. I give up.",
