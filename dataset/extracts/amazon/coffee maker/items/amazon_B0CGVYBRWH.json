                "reviewText": "I got this yesterday, set it up today and made my first cup. It was very good! The cup fits perfectly underneath, the brew strength is moderate (the way I like it), and the cup keeps the coffee toasty for a solid half-an-hour, so each sip was a pleasure.I'm very happy I chose this model. Others were more expensive and *didn't* include the cup (even though the cup was in the marketing photo). I am traveling this summer, and this little pot will be a great addition. Some hosts might be delightful people, but they make a lousy cup of joe. I like knowing I don't have to depend on anyone else to get a nice, smooth, creamy cup in the morning. I also like being able to use my favorite brands of coffee without buying k-cups. Costs much less and doesn't add the plastic waste of k-cups.I found single-cup paper coffee pods here on Amazon for a reasonable price (Wolfgang Puck Brand, $8.66 for 18). Even better! An added convenience, and these coffee pods can go straight into composting.I'm trying to reduce my coffee consumption to 2 cups a day, so this little maker will help me do that. Really, the only negative I have is the unit itself looks a little cheap. Plack plastic. But for $22 I will not complain! The only thing I would like to add is some sort of storage bag or bin, so I can keep the maker, cup, coffee, mini moos and scoop in one place.I paid $22.99 for this coffee maker. A great buy, and I highly recommend it.",

I have an older one also, I have to say that one is my favorite-bigger space underneath for the mug and lid(if I just want to cover it for a moment) This newest one, the mug barely fits under it(they stored the lid inside the coffee maker. All in All-it handles making a good cup of Joe as well as my larger coffee maker. This compact maker will be going with me when I travel, no nasty hotel makers. Sometimes, the Coffee Maker seems to not be working, clean it well with a vinegar mix running through, run water through a few times to unclog anything stuck in bottom or in hose. Once I did this, my older model roar back to life :).",

I had a similar black one about 15 yrs ago on my desk at the office when they started charging us to use their coffee machine, but not the coffee packets for the machine, so coffee was still free for me :). Anyway, I love that this uses ground coffee instead of those wasteful pods, comes with a reusable filter & a matching tumbler. It doesn\u2019t take up much room & can fit in a deep desk cabinet drawer.Hubs has his home office in the garage & now he doesn\u2019t need to schlep to the house to make his coffee. Although you need to wait till it cools down a bit before making another cup.",

This small coffee maker does not have a drip tray, a warmer, or do ANYTHING ELSE besides quickly brew you a to-go mug of coffee. Which is EXACTLY what it's purpose is.I can choose from using 12cup coffee pot, instant coffee, or single serve to-go mug coffee maker. In that order depending how many times I hit snooze that morning. Lol.Love the mint color also.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest I expected a little bit more from this coffee maker but you get what you pay for. The whole thing is made of cheap flimsy plastic and every time I use it, I feel like it is going to break. Also the start button is a complete mess. You have to push it very hard a couple of times just for it to turn in. And BEWARE, do not fill it up all the way with water unless you know it will all fit in your cup. It does not measure the water and will use all that you pour into it. So just a tip, fill your desired coffee cup with water first and use that to measure and pour into the basin. Otherwise, it\u2019s a coffee maker that does the job and has a quick brewing time like advertised. Just some small cosmetic and some functional things that just isn\u2019t my cup of tea. Regardless, I am keeping it as it is saving me much needed space in my kitchen and will make a tasty cup of warm coffee for me so I can deal with the small hassle. :)",

So her Crio Bru is her get the day started or warm-up in the evening goto.As others have noted, the included mug only keeps things warm for about half an hour. Not a problem on a commute as it were, but not if you want it hot when you get there. Like most people we have more thermal mugs around than we need, so my wife just uses one of them.That said, I knew that going in from other reviews and didn't buy the brewer for that. I got it so the wife would have her dedicated, easy-to-use and maintain, brewer. She loves it and that makes it 5 stars for me. After all, I got the gold star for getting it for her. ;)",

The thermos is nice but you can use any mug of course. Its easy to customize the amount of water and grounds to your needs. Use a tea bag or cocoa mix in your mug or fill the washable filter with loose leaf tea or coffee grounds. It's not hard to clean but I do use a paper filter at work to save time.",
