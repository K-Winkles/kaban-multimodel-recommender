Since Covid and WFH we started making pots of coffee and got away from our single pod coffee maker. With our old coffee maker with the hot plate, it didn\u2019t have an outo shut off and once it got below half a carafe it would end up burning the coffee if you left it more than an hour. This carafe keeps it hot for hours (4-5 hrs in our case, everyones idea of hot is different). It makes great coffee, hot, flavorful and when we want an extra boast we use the strong brew setting. You also use less coffee with this machine. For a 10 cup pot you use 7.5 tablespoons. I\u2019m so used to the old way one tbsp per cup and an extra for the pot.I\u2019m very happy with all the features - brew later setting, strong brew option, freshness timer to let you know how long ago your coffee was brewed, and auto clean function.After 3 1/2 months it still looks new. Just a little stainless steel polish keeps the carafe spotless.This was a great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Given our mineral-laden water, we've gone through many coffee makers. We chose this one thinking that a thermal carafe might lessen mineral deposits in heating coil as heat would be off once brewing finished. This might be what's helping as we've cleaned only when the maker indicates to do so (one time so far, and it was easy to do given built-in process). Coffee is good, stays hot for over an hour. Not sure why, but this maker is easier to take care of, basket easier to wash, rinse. In general, a good maker, better than the many we've had in past. Oh, another nice feature is that it's quiet while brewing, a little signal when coffee is finished.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Mr Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 to replace an older machine. My primary consideration in purchasing this machine was the thermal carafe. I did research into several similar machines but ultimately went with this one due to previous experience with this brand and the price. Several weeks into its use, I have no complaints and I'm completely satisfied. Here are some thoughts and highlights:Thermal Carafe: optimal coffee temperature (according to the packaging) is two hours but I have found that coffee that is 6 hours old is still hot enough to enjoy without reheating or getting a burned taste. The carafe is a thermos that maintains freshly brewed quality for hours without a heating element. My hands are a bit big so it is not easy to get my hand into the opening to clean but a brush quickly solves that problem. The carafe can also be placed on a table, counter, etc and take a bit of abuse since it is stainless steel.Brew basket: pulls out from the side for easy access. I use paper filters but a reusable filter would work well. I'm currently using the filter that was provided with the machine but I'm going to discontinue its use once it is used up since I have filtered water. It does not appear to affect the operation.Brew Time: the machine brews fast with a total time of approximately 8 minutes for \"10\" cups of coffee.Brew System: there is a rubber/silicone hood that connects the machine to the carafe to minimize exposure to the air to maximize temperature. The first few cups of coffee are extremely hot so it does work well. I can also pour a cup while it is brewing with no issues (though I use the delay brew feature so coffee is ready when I get up).You do have to use a little more coffee to get a stronger brew if that's what you like. It seems to be a \"feature\" of this style machine that it brews slightly weaker coffee.I have two small complaints but not enough to take a star. First, I don't like the chimes that first sound at the end of the brew cycle and then 2 hours later when the optimal quality time has passed. I will finish the coffee whether or not the quality time period has passed. While minor, I wish it could be disabled. Second, the water tank can be removed for easy filling but it is awkward when filled and water splashes. I choose to pour water into the tank without removing it but it would be a nice feature if the lid would seal to minimize splashing.Overall, if you want a quality machine that brews a great cup of coffee and maintains your coffee temperature for hours, this is the machine for you. It uses minimal electricity since there is no heating element so there is no chance of forgetting to turn the machine off.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice coffee maker. It runs extra hot (205 degrees!) very quickly. The coffee maker turns off the \"hot plate\" after two hours but the carafe is so well designed the coffee will still stay hot the next day!My only disappointments are - first it's kinda pricey for a coffee maker - I'd be OK with it if it held up better. After about five years (because it runs extra hot I guess) it will begin leaking not from the reservoir but from the brewing section (it leaks cold water though) - Mr Coffee knows about this but it will be out of warranty for a couple of years before it needs replacement (I guess it's worth it).It angers me that Mr Coffee is very well aware of this defective design though - but since I've never had as good a coffee maker as this one before I'm spoiled so this is my replacement for the exact same one I bought about five years ago.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this 5 years ago. ($79.00 in 2017). Best coffee maker I have ever owned. I can still brew a full pot in the evening and it remains piping hot in the morning and since it has not been on a burner overnight, the flavor is still great. Full pot stays hot (not warm......hot) for 10+ hours. A half pot stays hot for 4+ hours. A quarter pot stays hot for 1-2hours. The removable water reservoir is great. I can't imagine going back to the days of having to pour water into a built in reservoir.Everything still works after an estimated 3,000 pots of coffee made over 5 years. The flimsy lid to the reservoir broke when it fell to the ground in 2018. Black duct tape fixed it and it has been good since. The rubber seal around the coffe pot lid wore out after a few years. I substituted with an elastic band and it works fine. I have never used the timer feature. The only technical flaw is that the counter used to indicate when you should run a cleaning cycle resets if you unplug the unit, I just run a cleaining cycle once a month instead.",
