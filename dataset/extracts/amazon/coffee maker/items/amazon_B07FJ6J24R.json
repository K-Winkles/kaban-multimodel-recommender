                "reviewText": "Definitely the greatest \"Why didn't I think of this?\" invention ever. I use it for coffee from a coffee machine as it is already lacking in flavor. Putting it on ice makes it worse. With the HyperChiller, I can get cold coffee without watering it down with ice. It deserves five stars as it does a great job and is something I use almost every day. I also want to make sure the word gets out with positive reviews. There are a few cons which I hope they fix for V3. I will buy right away.1. Price. Was this a Shark Tank product where you sign your life away for a few peanuts? Based on the quality of the aluminum inside and complaints about cracked plastic, the HyperChiller should not be more than $10. Even with the 70% overhead needed to be on Amazon, cost before freight and tariffs should not be more than a dollar from a good manufacturer in China. That being said, you gotta love capitalism.2. This can and should be Made in the USA. Unless most of the profit margin is going to paying off the Sharks, this product can be easily made stateside. It would provide safety and peace of mind as it does come in contact with something you ingest.3. The vent hole for the inside ice chamber should be placed higher up the incline. As you pour hot liquid into the main chamber, you will need a very steady hand as anything more than a slow pour will result in hot liquid going into the inside ice chamber melting the ice inside and making cooling less effective. I imagine it takes longer to cool if there is less ice on both sides of the main chamber.4. Make a bigger version. To cool faster, instructions say to swirl the liquid inside the HyperChiller. I do not fill it to the brim to avoid spillage. Capacity is stated as 12.5 ounces. That is about the size of the tall size at Starbucks. Super size me.",

                "reviewText": "1) if you can\u2019t wait about five minutes for an ice cold cup of coffee WITHOUT ADDING ICE don\u2019t get this.2) only holds 12 1/2 ounces. But 4$3) it has more parts then I thought it was going to but they\u2019re not really a big pain. But it has you know a few parts four of them that you\u2019ve got to maintain and make sure you don\u2019t lose but they really don\u2019t need to be put into a dishwasher you just wash them off and you put them back together again and you keep putting it into the freezer after you use it you dump it out you wash it out fill it up again put it in the freezer. But it has more parts and I was expecting a lot more. I was expecting it to have just one container and that\u2019s it but it\u2019s nothing like thatdepending on how hot the coffee is you put into it you can get 2 usages but again you\u2019re going to wait between five and 10 minutes for the second one as well. So if you\u2019re in a hurry and you want 24 ounces of coffee this is not what you get. This was not exactly what I was expecting when I got this. I understand the concept of it is you know pretty basic but I didn\u2019t think it was gonna be like this I thought that it was gonna be a very large container and it\u2019s not I also thought I was gonna be able to drink out of it and you can\u2019t because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s not meant to be drunk you have to pour into something else. But overall of course it works. The concept is simple there\u2019s a ton of ice with a metal container and a coffee goes into it and as the ice melts the coffee gets colder. I\u2019m not disappointed at all. Because I can wait that amount of time to get an iced coffeeIt works. I watched a video about it and you know it\u2019s about 60 seconds or so they said to leave it in. To be completely honest here that\u2019s not how it works. When I get iced coffee I don\u2019t want any ice inside of it OK I want the coffee to be cold like it was in the refrigerator I don\u2019t want the ice. ice waters down no matter what you get. You have to leave this there for about five minutes if you take it directly from your coffee pot and poured it. It only holds 12 1/2 ounces. But if you leave it there for five minutes or so it comes out ice cold. And depending on how hot it is you can get more than one usage out of it you may have to wait five or 10 minutes out. But if you want a cup of coffee that\u2019s going to be cold without ice you\u2019re not gonna get it in 60 seconds no matter what are you shaking around you know slowly in your head and swirly they said to do or to leave it standing straight you\u2019re not gonna get it cold like that you\u2019re still gonna have to put it over ice. So wait five minutes if you can",

                "reviewText": "I brewed using a keurig, let it sit for about 5 minutes then swirled the flask for another minute, coffee was ice cold. However the ice inside was nearly melted so water poured through the holes that's on the lid, so you have to use your finger to plug the hole as you pour. Another thing I noticed was some coffee getting into the middle and sides through the lid holes.They say it can be used twice before having to refreeze but that's only if you want the coffee lukewarm poured over ice. If you actually want it ice cold it can really only be used once before the ice inside is nearly melted. But some brewers like nespresso don't brew as hot as a keurig so maybe your experience will be different.The build quality could be better as well, seems like it's only a matter of time before the plastic cracks.",
