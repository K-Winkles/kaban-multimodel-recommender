The patented 3-in-1 brew technology of the AeroPress Clear Coffee maker eliminates bitterness and acidity and creates a smooth, rich, full bodied cup of coffee. Paper or metal micro-filters allow you to use finer ground coffee for a faster brew time and no grit (unlike the mesh filter of a French press).

                "reviewText": "I bought the Aeropress to brew cacao, and it did a great job. The brew was rich and flavorful, but I am really a coffee drinker. When I finally got around to making my first cup, I noticed it looked different, it seemed thicker and richer. After I fixed it to my liking, I took a sip. OMG! Totally blew my mind! I have never tasted so much flavor in a sip of coffee, I didn't know all of those flavors were there, and so smooth! Between the first and second sip, I ordered another one for my brother in law, the other coffee drinker in the family. I gave him a few days and then I called him to see how he liked it. We both came to the same conclusion: time to get rid of the coffee maker and the French press!What I like about it: makes amazing coffee and coffee drinks, love the metal reusable filter, and the quick and easy clean up.What I don't like about it: haven't figured that out yet!",

My coffee is ready in a jiffy, and cleanup takes about half a minute. I especially like the glossy hard, crystal clear, high performance polymer!

It\u2019s super easy to clean, very user friendly, and I love the clear version. I almost didn\u2019t pay the extra money for the clear vs the original but I am so glad that I did. This is becoming a huge staple for me in terms of my coffee setup.",

                "reviewText": "First I want to say that even tho I bought this on Amazon, I first heard about it on a That Dude Can Cook YouTube video.This has made my mornings so much better. I have coffee first thing every morning. I\u2019m not a morning person so I\u2019m never at my best when I first get up. Some days the promise of my one guiltless pleasure is the only way I\u2019m able to convince myself it\u2019s worth getting out of bed. However, I\u2019ve had trouble finding a smooth and rapid way to that first sip. I\u2019ve been using a French press but hate the clean up. It feels like coffee grounds get everywhere. And you can\u2019t wash them down the sink as they are bad for the pipes. Recently we had to have 8 feet of pipe replaced due to one very long clog. Now we are very careful about what goes in the garbage disposal.Now I\u2019m able to pop the grounds into the garbage can in one swift move and boom I\u2019m ready to make my next cup.I do think the coffee tastes better now. Maybe it\u2019s just in my head - a placebo effect if you will. But it really does make good coffee and in less time. I don\u2019t know how but it seems they\u2019ve found a way to get more flavor out of the grounds in less time.Thanks that dude that can cook for telling me about this great product.",

                "reviewText": "I came across the Aeropress years ago when a friend demonstrated his, but I never bought one before because I have a Nespresso machine. Fast forward to this week and I\u2019m on holiday in a caravan so finally bought an Aeropress so I can have decent coffee here.Decent coffee is an understatement, the Aeropress makes exceptional coffee. It\u2019s very easy to use, it takes a couple of minutes to make a coffee, and cleaning it is as simple as rinsing it under a tap. The coffee it produces is smooth and tasty without any hint of bitterness, and you can have Americanos, Lattes or any other style\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make Espressos as such, as you need high pressure for them, but they\u2019re as close to espresso as it\u2019s possible to get without actually being espresso, there\u2019s very little difference at all. The blurb on the box is careful to call it espresso style coffee!Your first cup of coffee from the Aeropress will taste great, but mastering it will only come in time given the myriad of variables possible: amount of coffee, amount of water, temperature of water, steeping time, number of stirs, pressure applied to plunger and so on - a search on YouTube reveals hundreds of videos claiming the formula for the perfect cup of coffee, heck there\u2019s even an annual World Championship for the best coffee produced with Aeropress!Another fantastic thing about the Aeropress is the price - it\u2019s highly inexpensive given the quality of coffee it produces, and the fact that its inventor has 40 patents related to its construction. It looks deceptively simple, but it\u2019s very clever really.It\u2019s now got me into coffee in a big way - I thought I was into it before, but now I can\u2019t wait to get home and buy a gooseneck kettle for more even pressure of water pouring onto the coffee grounds, a manual grinder to ensure the correct consistency of the coffee grounds , and fresh coffee beans to grind myself - all to see how close to the perfect cup of coffee I can get!I\u2019m prepared to bet that, if you buy an Aeropress, you will be AeroIMpressed by the top notch coffee it helps produce, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to any coffee drinker - you\u2019ll not look back!A very easy two thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
