Step 2 Next, fill base with water to the level of the safety valve. Replace the funnel into the base and fill it with ground coffee; do not press coffee down. For best results, use fresh roasted, finely ground coffee. The recommendation is to use a 6-to-1 water to coffee ratio. For each tablespoon of coffee, use 3 oz. of water. Step 3 Tighten the top to the base. Make sure the top is completely secure on the base before putting on the stovetop. Step 4 Heat espresso maker on low to medium temperature until coffee bubbles on top. Remove from heat and serve.",

                "reviewText": "Even though it has only been one day that I have had this, I feel confident in its build quality and am convinced that it is an excellent value at $23. I can tell the handle will not and is not meant to withstand any torque as a result of joining or dismantling the unit. It is meant to hold the unit, and allow pouring and that is it. The reservoir holds 8oz, no more on this 6 cup model. Do not put more than that in the reservoir or you may have problems such as leaks. It is the perfect amount for 2 cups with steamed or warmed/frothed milk. I used some old freezer beans for my first run, I was also using a new hand grinder so I am still getting used to the grind settings. It was a fine grind, I tamped lightly. The first pot smelled fantastic! but I dumped it down the drain and waited for things to cool down to clean things up and go again. This time with a french roast bean and a slightly more coarse grind but still fine. Assembled the halves being sure that there were no loose grinds to interfere with the 2 parts joining properly and put it on the heat. I preheated the water this time and it started brewing a little faster. It gives the same auditory signals that an electric espresso machine gives, the sputtering means it is about done and remove it from the heat when it is mostly silent. It was a fantastic cup of espresso, well cappuccino I suppose, just like I remember from my old machine. This type of coffee making takes some attention to detail and careful execution to be successful. It is not a set it and forget it kind of thing. You are committed to the process for about 12 minutes, depending on your heat source and barista skills. Of course once you have enjoyed your Java, you have to clean the unit and dry it for best results.I experienced no leaks, no surprises just a splendid cup of espresso. The unit is easy to clean, no soap just hot water and brush or cloth. maybe occasionally remove the silicone ring(takes a little effort) and give the filter a good cleaning especially if it ever gets left for extended periods after use. I use baking soda to remove any stains where coffee is involved.I will add any updated information as time goes by but for now I have full confidence in this product and recommend it to anyone who is looking for an economical way to make espresso that is full stainless steel. Seeing how things have changed in the last few years where old time quality has given way to new world garbage, it is refreshing to see that a quality item can still be had for a decent price amongst all the inferior options.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used a French press for years, and have been very happy with it. However, I became interested in the possibility of acquiring an espresso machine, but the size, cost and complicated use of one discouraged me. I came across Moki pots and thought one might be a great alternative. I didn\u2019t want one made of aluminum due to health risks. This pot is stainless steel. It cleans as easily as my French press with only water. An added plus is the coffee basket uses only half the coffee I have to use in my French press. While one can use espresso coffee, I am very pleased with the taste of medium roast 100% arabica beans. I have an Oxo coffee grinder capable of a very fine grind, a big help in getting full flavor. I\u2019ve added a frothing machine and enjoy a latte every morning. The pot is well designed. The big plastic handle and ear on its lid have prevented my being burned. It feels substantial and easy to hold despite being small. I have a ceramic top stove, and wondered if it would heat properly given that the bottom is not flat. Instead, it has a circular outer ridge which slightly lifts the center area from the stovetop, but it heats up well. I hope it lasts a long time, as I do like it. I\u2019d look for this brand again if I needed a replacement.",

                "reviewText": "My wife wanted a home espresso maker so she could quit her $4.50/day Peet's habit, and before spending big bucks on a fancy machine, she wanted to try a simple stovetop \"moka pot\" to see how she'd like it. She's delighted - at how simple it is to make espresso with the Primula, the quality of the espresso, and how much money *and* time she's saving vs. her daily trip to Peet's. And as the home dishwasher and repair person, so am I: the Primula is simple, solid, easy to clean, and I'm spared what could be endless headaches trying to keep a less than top of the line semi-automated espresso machine working. And now that we're sticking with the Primula, I wanted to find out if there are replacements available for the gasket, the one part that can wear out - and there are, available on Amazon, and they fit perfectly: Primula Replacement Silicone Gasket for Stainless Steel 6 Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, Set of 3 . A very satisfying purchase! If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, Caffe Trieste espresso grind is a good choice for coffee; it works well in the pot.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what we needed! This little gem of an espresso maker works perfectly with easy clean up and the most important part, it's all stainless steel so it won't leach aluminum into your drinks or your body! IT is so easy to use. You fill the bottom with water, fill the removeable filter with espresso coffee like LavAzza which is awesome, and put it on the stove top for a few minutes, mine is a gas stove. It rinses clean in seconds and looks nice on the counter top for daily use. My son has made lattes with frothed milk and added syrups and a little whipped topping and says that it is as good as any he has purchased. I'm not much for sweetened drinks and I use only full fat cream, I use 2 oz full fat cream warmed and 3 oz espresso and it is fantastic! We couldn't be happier and from the reviews I read on counter top machines, this seems like the way to go. We have 4 coffee drinkers in the house so we use K-cups, a french press and now this. My poor old coffee pot sits unused unless we have a large gathering. Thank you for this quality Primula espresso maker!",
