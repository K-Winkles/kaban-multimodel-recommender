                "reviewText": "This was a great buy for an extremely casual coffee drinker whose usage can be described as 2-3 a month at most. The machine is a decent size, taking up less space than the old one. It\u2019s easy to use and clean. I don\u2019t use the clock or the programmable features as it\u2019s unnecessary for me. Based on my usage, I expect it to last a very long time. It was good but and recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I agree that for the price, this coffee maker is fine. That said, I bought it to replace an old Black & Decker that I've had for many years, and I don't like the new one as much, primarily because the filter basket does not sit flat on the counter, so when I fill it with coffee, I must bring the coffee to the machine and fill it there. Not a big deal, but also, the lid sticks, so requires 2 hands for me to open it. It's also noisier than my old one. Wish they had just stuck with their original design, although I do like that this one is shorter than the older version.",

I returned it for a replacement, and the seller was very good about that. I received the replacement in December and the enamel on the heating unit is wearing off even worse than the prior one. It's too much bother to return it at this point, especially since I did not keep the packaging. I'll just be looking for another brand. I don't understand why the quality has gotten worse since July. It's a shame because otherwise it's a great coffee maker, fits my needs and makes a good tasting cup of coffee. If you do buy this one, I'd caution you to keep the packaging in case you need to return it.",
