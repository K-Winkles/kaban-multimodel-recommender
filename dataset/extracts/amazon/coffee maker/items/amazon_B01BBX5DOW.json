It also comes with an internal filter, in case you have hard water which we do. The only thing I would improve is the lid attachment. We have found that it is not secure and will dislodge when carafe becomes less full. While pouring coffee, keep hands free of cup in case it dislodges. There is a possibility the remaining HOT coffee will scald your hand if you are holding you cup. regardless, very good coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "Sending it back for a refund, very displeased since it had high reviews. Expect more from Mr. Coffee.While running just water through it after I first unboxed it, before making actual coffee, it had an extremely strong plastic smell, which I figured would go away as it got used, but I have seen other reviews suggesting it did not.I ran just water through three times, three pots that night, and it nearly overflowed twice. I fortunately caught it both times. What appeared to have happened is the basket was not set just exactly, perfectly right so the spring stayed \u201cup\u201d and the water could not drip down through the basket into the pot. Instead it filled up the basket. As a result, the basket nearly overflowed the hot water everywhere. I jostled the basket a little and it got itself set and the water poured through. I was a little concerned but I figured I could just double check the basket when I brew. User error, right? Wrong.I did double check the basket making coffee this morning, and somehow it still didn\u2019t set right, or possibly got knocked off center when I closed the lid due to the design. But lo and behold, the basket overflowed hot coffee and grounds everywhere.Very poorly designed. There are plenty of other fine coffee pots on the market that don\u2019t require someone to hover over them while a simple pot of coffee brews. I\u2019ve never had to do that before. I\u2019ll look for another simple Mr. Coffee pot.",

Seems like the spring it too strong for the removal while brewing feature, which makes the filter overflow. It made a huge mess on my counter three times already. I've taken the spring out now. I'll see how it does. Works wonderful otherwise. Fast brewing, good flavor, and easy to use.",
