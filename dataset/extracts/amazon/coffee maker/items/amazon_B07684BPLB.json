                "reviewText": "This is now the second Hamilton Beach coffee maker I've had and I have to say the ease of use and the taste of the coffee and the general quality of these machines so far is unsurpassed for me. This past Christmas I decided to replace my still working not having any problems Hamilton Beach because it had hard water stains and it was going on a few years so I thought I was upgrading. Boy was I wrong I bought a GE coffee maker which started malfunctioning within a week of use so I decided to return it and buy myself the slightly upgraded version of my old Hamilton Beach which is this one. Also the ease of filling it with water from the front instead of from the top makes a big difference for my mom who sometimes has trouble with her shoulder and is a small woman so that was a little tall for her on the GE. The programmable function always works perfectly and the fact that it's got the settings for whether you want a boulder cup of coffee is also great. The coffee comes out hot and delicious every time I cannot complain and I don't see myself deviating from this brand again. Really a good buy for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Very well built and ready to use. It's everything you'd expect from a coffee maker and more. I especially like the front opening for pouring water in. I never use the rear except for cleaning.The 2 hr auto off is great, and every coffee maker should have that.Strong and well built. We use it 2 or 3 times each foy for a month now and it still seems just as good as brand new.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Untold details Hamilton vs Atomi",
                "reviewText": "Please read I hope this helps someone. Sorry, it's long.Returned due to unexplained operation details. I bought this unit over the Atomi due to the brand name, front load filter, and front water refill. Unfortunately, when I received the machine, I figured out very quickly that it was not what I wanted due to how it operated. To explain briefly, I work shifts, so my early morning schedules are on different days of the week. Therefore, when I want to sleep in on my days off, it is on different weekdays every week. This unit does not accommodate this type of use. It only allows for setting a schedule through the app Monday\u2013Sunday without the option to set a delay from the machine itself. Basically, you have to pick between using this machine with a schedule or with voice commands. This was my main issue, as was the fact that to use any smart controls, the \u201cready to brew\u201d button must be pressed every time for any operation to work. So if you have a schedule set and push \u201cready to brew\u201d but want to sleep in and use voice controls or the app to turn the machine on, you have to go into the app and turn off the schedule, or it will go off at the set time. The \u201cready to brew\u201d button ruined the functionality of this machine. For a Monday through Friday worker, this machine would work better. With the Atomi, I just get my coffee ready at night and leave it for voice commands or the app if I want to sleep in, or I just push the delay brew button on the front of the unit for the preset time of delay brew that I set from the unit itself. You can also set a schedule in the app. Basically, the Atomi is \"ready to brew\" at any time, any day; you just have to tell it to go. So in review:The bad:1) The \"ready to brew\" button has to be pushed for any operation to work. (Voice commands and delayed brewing) This button ruined the functionality of the machine.2) All operations must be made through the app.3) The power cord is very short.4) Carafe does not like its home. It can be difficult to place back due to the auto stop spring being too long. I think this is the reason for some reviews saying it spills out.5) Essentially, you have to pick to use this machine by voice commands or schedule, not both.6) Don't forget to hit the \u201cready to brew\u201d button if you want coffee at all.7) NO DELAY BREW BUTTON!The good:To be clear, this coffee maker did work and did its job. They just messed up the fine details to make this a fully functional machine to suit everybody\u2019s needs.1) I like the front-load filter and water refill.2) The carafe seemed sturdy and well made.3) It is best for Monday-Friday workers not rotating shift schedules.Overall, I returned this for the Atomi and like the Atomi 100 percent better. You can set a delay brew from the machine itself, and the unit is ready to work at all times without having to have any \"ready to brew\" buttons pressed prior to use. The set-up was easy on the Atomi and the time was accurate. Time will tell about the longevity of the Atomi.Take away the \u201cready to brew\u201d button and have it always ready. Bring back a delay brew button on the machine itself, and this will fit everyone's needs perfectly. All this is just my experience and opinion. I hope it helped someone",

I received it today (1/25/2024)\u2026 I plugged it in and within less than a minute it automatically connected to my WiFi, the clock set immediately! I went to my Alexa app and all was good!! I brewed my 1st pot via the Alexa command and I am enjoying a cup of very hot, delicious Starbuck\u2019s Green Apron Blend coffee!!! Personally, I don\u2019t need an audible beep to tell me my coffee is ready and my coffee doesn\u2019t last 2 hours so that beep is moot as well!! This is an attractive, functual, quiet coffee maker! Great price point too!! Highly recommend! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2615\ufe0f",
