Couldn't find any review that mentioned changing the head so I was worried it wouldn't fit, but it fits perfectly and works just the same.I also read it brews too fast, but after 5-6 mins it came out pretty well, doesn't taste burnt to me.Another issue I read was that the metal separator that comes with it breaks easily. I just don't really use or need it. A pod good \ud83d\udc4d",

Since, my day starts at 3:30 am, I made my espresso the night before. SoOnce it got hot, it began to leak. I waited and ghe leaking stopped and it began to brew. Everything seemed fine and Iwent to bed, thinking it would have auto shut off. It does not shut off and by morning, it was burning. I guess I got what I paid and now it will be returned.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars This machine only makes 3.5oz; not 3, 1.5oz cups (4.5oz total) they advertise.",
                "reviewText": "I like the convenience of using electric versus stovetop. It's quicker and easier.I don't like the misrepresentation of the cup size (I would have purchased the larger size.) Again, it makes 3.5ozs, not 4.5ozs. 1oz may not sound like much, but when you're only working with 3 or 4ozs, it is.I don't like the very poorly written instructions and the simple lack of some instructions.For example, they state to use a medium grind, it doesn't work. It needs to be a fine grind, otherwise the water just quickly rushes through the coffee and you get a very weak tasteless cup. You can't throttle the heat and therefore the rate of coffee flow like you can on a stove top. Because of this the grind needs to be finer to slow the water flow rate so it has time to extract the flavor.The water level differences they give you for making a 1 cup vs 3 cups makes no sense (a 1/4\" lower water level as they state does not change the cups from 3 to 1cup. Always fill the tank to just below the pressure valve. Same with the coffee, fill it up every time; the \"1 cup divider\" the say to use will again give you a weak cup of tasteless coffee. One last thing, once the coffee starts to fill the upper chamber, remove it from the electric base. It has enough heat to continue pushing the remaining water up into the upper chamber. Leaving it on longer just overheats the lower boiler for no reason.Other than that I like the machine, and it made a fine cup of cuban style coffee. I just don't like companies that don't take the time needed to test run their instructions or make misrepresentations.I hope this helps you overcome the shortfalls of the instructions and gives you a great tasking cup of coffee. BTW, I use Starbucks \"House blend\" ground to an espresso fine grind.",
