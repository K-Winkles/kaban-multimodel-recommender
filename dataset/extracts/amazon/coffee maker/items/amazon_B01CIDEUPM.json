        "description": "The dream to offer the best coffee to the world, since 1933. Over the years, illy has perfected this process to obtain a coffee with a rich aromatic profile, balanced flavor and a one-of-a-kind aroma. To make our coffee, we select only the finest Arabica coffee plants, grown sustainably by our farmers in over 30 countries around the world. We cultivate long-lasting relationships with them based on shared values and personal growth. Because it is only by working together that we can achieve exceptional results.We select only the 1% of the finest Arabica coffee beans, thanks to many years of collaboration with growers who place maximum importance on quality and sustainability. Researching and experimenting with raw materials is a journey that never ends. After processing, the beans undergo a meticulous selection to ensure zero defects: even a single imperfect Arabica coffee bean can compromise the aroma of our blend. We preserve and enhance the aromas through our patented pressurized cans. Patented in 1934 by illy, pressurization is a preservation system in which the air in the tin is replaced by an inert gas at a pressure greater than that of the atmosphere. In this way, not only is the freshness of our coffee maintained, but its aroma is also enhanced.",

                "reviewText": "This is the only good decaf coffee out there. Period. It\u2019s delicious as loose coffee percolated but as a K-cup, it\u2019s weak. But all decaf coffee in a K-cup is weak. But this is the only one that actually has a good taste. I\u2019d like it stronger but it\u2019s good. BUT, they deliver it just as is in the regular box. There is no outer box to protect the product. The K-cup box is smashed on one corner. I\u2019ll still use it because the pods are ok. Unfortunately they don\u2019t sell the kcups at the store so it has to be ordered.But ultimately the ONLY GOOD DECAF OUT THERE. Thanks illyWish they made a strong decaf.Gave it four stars because of the lack of outer box",
