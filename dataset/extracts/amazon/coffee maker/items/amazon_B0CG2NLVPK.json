                "reviewText": "After reviewing several grind and brew coffee makers I decided to purchase the one from GE Caf\u00e9. The set up process is very easy. And it makes delicious coffee! The best coffee I have had in along time. I read in a few posts that the water carafe leaked where the filter is installed. I can see this happening if you do not seat the gasket properly. I have not had a leak at all. I have to say it is a little more than I wanted to spend but I'd rather be happy with the first purchase then to have to purchase this one after trying a different one that I didn't like. I use the Gold brewing feature and the coffee is hot and stays hot for several hours after in the thermal carafe. I hope this helps anyone on the fence about buying this coffee maker. I LOVE it!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, we have recently redone our kitchen and used all GE Cafe appliances, so when looking for a new coffee maker to buy, this was top of the list. It connects to the GE \"Smart HQ\" app, where you can do some very cool stuff, like set up favorite settings for a one button brew, control strength, temp and ounces, and schedule brew times. And of course, you can order GE replacement filters directly from the app if you're not using the brass filters. There is also a descale alert so you know when to run that procedure to keep the coffee maker in tip top shape.I want to immediately point out one thing that may be important for your purchase if you have limited space. The holder for the brew basket swings out to the right, it's not removable, so you need to make sure you've got clearance for that. You cannot put the right side of the coffee maker against a wall.As far as the coffee produced goes, it's really good. There really is nothing like freshly ground and brewed coffee. Because the appliance comes with brass filters (a small one for single cup and large one for carafe), none of the oils get absorbed and all make it into the cup. That leads to a very smooth and full flavored coffee. Compared to a capsule based coffee maker, where the coffee tends to be bitter because they typically use a higher temp, this coffee is amazing. And I don't feel guilty because I'm producing minimal waste (no filter to toss, no plastic cartridge that ends up in the trash)With the scheduling, you can wake up to fresh ground and brewed coffee, which can't be beat, although I recommend using the carafe or an insulated mug (a tall one, see below), otherwise the coffee gets cold if you get up late.There are few things that detract from the appliance, hence the 4 stars. First and foremost, none of the things that get dirty, like carafe, filter basket, etc, can go in the dishwasher, not even the top rack. That is so sad, because nobody wants a sink full of handwashing. If you don't have a dishwasher, then add a half star back to this review :-)The other thing that detracts is the single cup brew. The filter basket ends up being pretty far from a normally sized mug, so when the coffee flows into the mug, it will splash and make a little bit of mess. This can be fixed by either raising the cup somehow by placing items under it, or using a tall mug, like a yeti-style insulated one. Also (and this isn't really specific to this maker), the valve setting in the filter basket for single cup brew allows coffee to continue to drip after the cup is removed. When used with the carafe, it will open a valve when the carafe is inserted, and close that valve when removed, so no dripping. This obviously can't be done with a coffee cup, so, you get the drips. There is a little tray in the base to catch those drips, but it is not removable. In my opinion, GE should have made the drip tray removable for easier cleaning, since you will get drips in there if you use the single cup mode. This is where the other half star went in this review.Overall, I highly recommend this coffee maker, especially if you're already using the Smart HQ app and have other GE Cafe appliances. The convenience, flavor, and beauty can't be beat!",

                "reviewText": "I must admit the design is what first caught my eye but the combined coffee grinder, coffee maker, and thermo carafe have exceeded my expectations. With new kitchen, I needed to consolidate counter top appliances. Replacing coffee maker and coffee bean grinder with one appliance was a first step. My better half sleeps late every morning while I start my morning around 6am so having a thermo carafe helps. Performance has been flawless and the many optional settings helps to meet all our coffee needs. We conducted a coffee taste test by preheating thermo with hot water, using \"Gold\" setting, 200F, 10-cups using Starbucks French Roast. Best pot of coffee we have had from any machine that we have owned. We also confirmed that thermo keeps coffee drinking hot for 2-hrs as described. Web app features that allow you to control everything and to save 4-favorites has been very useful. I have saved 10-cup Gold and 5-cup thermo preheat as examples. Water reservoir that holds 75oz (1.5 full pots) allows me to run the thermo preheat, dump water and then run the 10-cup gold without having to refill the water...great engineering. Having this beautiful Cafe design that matches our Cafe refrigerator was a bonus. Love the stainless steel with copper accents. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had the coffee maker for 3 months now. It\u2019s really a beautiful design and looks nice and for a few weeks it made fantastic coffee. Then\u2026 problems. One out of three pots that I brew, the result is hot water. The grind runs, I\u2019ve taken it apart and cleaned it, kept it filled with beans - it just decided to only grind a couple beans and make undrinkable light coffee. Not great when you are headed out the door.I thought that was the worst of it but wow does this thing leak water out of the reservoir. It would make a mess before I changed the filter because for some reason there is always 3-4 oz of water sitting in the receptacle you put the reservoir in so when you refill the tank and go to put it back in, it pushes that reserve water out onto your counter.Then changing the filter and lining up the new washer is an event to say the least. If it\u2019s not perfect the reservoir leaks all over you. Then I got it perfect, and now the machine itself just leaks water, like all of it, from the bottom of the receptacle.Three months and $300+ later, I\u2019m left with a leaking piece of junk that even if I stand there with a towel stopping the river like leak for the 8 minutes it takes to brew, I have a 66% chance of having a proper strength pot of coffee. No thanks. I\u2019m going back to a simple coffee machine and getting a separate grinder.",
