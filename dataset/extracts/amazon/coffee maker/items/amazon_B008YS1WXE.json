I got it to make a hot fresh cup of coffee before I have to plow snow. Sometimes we are sitting waiting on snow to hit. And a hot fresh cup of coffee is great. Stop to shovel the walks. You can make it up. It's ready in about 4-6 minutes. I have used it without coffee. To heat water. To make instance oatmeal or soups to. Working on houses with no heat or electricity. It's great on a cold day. To make up a fast hot cup. I don't like the new coffee machine at all the service station and convenient stores. That tastes like dirty water. The reusable filter is great. I use a pod filter in my reusable filter. Just to make it faster to clean. When making multiple cups. On the go. It's a durable coffee maker. And haven't had any issues. Both machines still working great. I want to have a spare. In case they stop making them.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this for 3 months. It replaced a more expensive single-use coffee maker that died after about 2 years. I picked this one because of the small footprint and its appearance on several lists of good coffee makers (always as the budget choice). In looking for a new coffee maker, my main criterion was a small footprint. I store my coffee maker in a cabinet and my space is limited. Many of these machines take up more space because of the design of their tanks. This one is very lightweight and feels cheap but it works well and I think the coffee tastes fine. Will it last? I don't know. Also: *I donated the mug it came with (not insulated); I don't think they should bother with it. *Some of my mugs are a little too wide to sit properly on the platform--they fit, but are crooked. I'm able to use them. I don't know if they have unusual dimensions or if a lot of mugs might not sit flat. *It is easier to put the water in if you use a measuring cup or pitcher with a spout--learn from me and stop spilling water when you dump it in from a mug. *It does splatter if you use something shorter (like a mug) but that doesn't bother me--I just wipe the splatters up when I'm done.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic product. I have gotten a cup of coffee at starbucks that cost more than this brewer so I wasn't expecting it to be this great. I went from a mr coffee to Melita brewing system (heat the water and pour it into the filter) to this. I like coffee fresh, not after it has sat for a while, so I like to make it cup by cup. Now, as for the details: the big filter basket fits the groove on the left; the inner filter fits the groove on the right. When these are positioned correctly, the top snaps down perfectly. I use a paper filter left over from my Melita days (Generic kroger box is about $2 for 100). I recommend using this little paper cone finger because you can dump it out and rinse the basket clean in seconds. Otherwise, cleaning up grounds can be a P.I.T.A. I had to adapt my coffee making habits a little bit. With the old mr coffee, I used to turn it on as I was filling the water, and putting in the grounds, but this one is so fast, I pour in the water, put in the filter and coffee, snap down the lid and turn it on. The first time I plugged it in, it was already on. I ran water through it once, because I didn't want that burned plastic factory smell. I use the black plastic mug to pour the water in. The perfect amount. It takes about 3 minutes from start to finish, just enough time to do the dishes, feed the dog, start breakfast. I use a jigger to measure my standard Folgers ground coffee (about the size of a Keurig cup). Once or twice when I was low on coffee and used less than that to make it last longer, used a second mug to pour the hot water through the grounds a 2nd time, but hey, I'm cheap And weird.) It takes a few seconds, then the water drips through pretty fast. I like using the paper filter also because it probably helps the water stay in contact with the brew a bit longer. The last few seconds of brewing, the last bit of water in the reservoir hisses and steams as the element dries. Then the light snaps off. You can hear the click. Give it a few seconds for the basket to drain to get all that coffee goodness.There's no warmer at the bottom of the cup. It's a plastic cup, why would you heat it? Fewer parts to break.I would not put this mug in the microwave. (A microwave is very hard on containers with nested parts, and it has a metal band around the top.)I highly recommend this Black & Decker CM618 Single Serve Coffee maker to people who like coffee one fresh cup at a time. I don't know how well it would handle multiple consecutive cups.I do use a paper melita-type filter and after the coffee is in, I tamp down the top of the cone to make a little package. I use the single serving size,and the kroger brand. It's cheaper and better because it has a little tab that makes handling easier. Prices at the grocery range from $2 to $4 for 40-100 filters, more for name brand filters. If you're a purist-recycler, the grounds are good for garden compost.At the end of the hot water heating cycle, there's about 3 seconds worth of that hot plastic smell but it does not affect the coffee at all, the way a mr coffee does.I have only had this a few months, but it is very reliable and is working perfectly. If I were still teaching, this would be the coffee maker I'd have in my classroom; if I still had a camper, this would take up little space and be faster than heating water for Melita on the propane stove. I'd use one in my office, but I'm a writer, and my home office is 3 steps from the kitchen.",

El vaso que incluye mide 17cm de alto y 8.5 cm de diametro, cualquier vaso con esas medidas queda perfecto para preparar directamente.- El boton de encendido solo tiene 1 estado, una vez que llenas el tanque de agua, pones el cafe, presionas el boton (Que no parece boton) y no se detendra hasta que termine su ciclo, es decir, no la puedes detener a media preparacion a menos que la desconectes, este boton me parece algo extrano, a primera vista pareciera que esta defectuoso pero funciona.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good! Super handy. I got it on sale for $20. Easy to use. The 3 tbsp / 2 soft pod coffee grounds limit is super high, probably for very coarse grind. I get a perfect serving from 2 tbsp of my go-to NoName decaf (giant yellow container). When I use espresso grind (Lavazza) 1 tbsp is plenty. I use the included tumbler just to easily measure out the right amount of water, and perc into a Starbucks tall cup (about the same dimensions). If there isn't quite enough coffee in the cup, it's super easy to add a bit more water to the reservoir and turn on the unit to run it through. It has shut off for me consistently each time it runs out of water. I still pull the plug when I'm done just in case. You do need to line up everything in the filter assembly for it to stop properly, but that's like any coffee maker. Just read the directions once! If you want instant coffee, well.. buy instant coffee or an espresso maker. No drip coffee maker will be super quick. This takes exactly as much time as I'd expect any other machine to take, proportionate to the amount it makes. I love this thing so far. And if you make a mess the first time, it rinses out just fine under the tap.",
