                "reviewText": "As a coffee lover, when I first heard about \"Cold Brew\" I knew I'd want to try that. I reviewed a lot of options but something that is easy to clean and that's long-lasting, with a stainless steel filter that could be quickly rinsed and cleaned out and that it was reasonably priced is what sold me on this Cold Brew Mason Coffee Maker. Good reviews helped too =)I read the documentation, researched on the net and then I was Ready to get started! I let mine sit out for 18 hours overnight and it's plenty dark, strong/full flavor, I noticed that there wasn't any bitterness and it is deeeeeeeelish with Italian Sweet Cream or your favorite liquid coffee creamer over ice! I prefer iced on hot days but it's good any time. I bought the 64-ounce size and found it fit well in our refrigerator without causing overcrowding. Since I am the only one that drinks it, it lasted quite a while. I'm giving serious consideration to buying the smaller one as well. Great product, fast shipping/delivery and I highly recommend this to any cold brew coffee lover OR those who merely want to try it. ~ Enjoy!",

This cold brew maker and pitcher is so nice!It makes about 6 cups of cold brew, and if you make sure to follow the instructions to get the best results, you wind up with an amazingly rich and strong cold brew coffee!I make a coarse ground of Death Wish Coffee, fill the coffee cylinder, add cold water while smushing and stirring the coffee bean mush (make sure to get it nice and saturated so you get all those grinded beans!)Then set in the refrigerator for 12+ hours (emphasis on the plus if you like your cold brew nice and strong) and it\u2019s ready to serve! And since it\u2019s so strong you can dilute it more with your favorite syrups and creamers and still taste the coffee, so the 6 cups go a long way!",
