Led by a brother and sister who grew up on the factory floor, CHEMEX Corporation is made up of a team of people who are passionate about bringing superior brewing equipment to the global community. Pure Design. Pure Flavor... It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But imitation can truly be no substitute for the original CHEMEX coffeemaker brewing system. Few products can match the flawless blending of design and function of the CHEMEX. Its visual elegance has earned it a place in the permanent collections in many of the most prestigious museums worldwide. Its functionally has been awarded by the scientific and coffee communities. CHEMEX coffeemakers are made from the same high quality glass used for lab ware. It is beautifully clear and imparts no flavors or chemicals into your brewed coffee. Each coffeemaker is inspected, polished and hand tied by one of our team, before getting boxed up for shipping. CHEMEX Bonded filters are based on laboratory paper and designed to remove bad fats, bitterness, acidity and sediments that all other types of filters leave behind. Each filter is cut in house, on a machine that is operated by one of our team.

                "reviewText": "When I read the reviews of this product, I was a little skeptical. I started drinking coffee, maybe ten years ago. After the usual drip machine, I went to a French press. Then I went to Aeropress (which is a good method but it is too expensive because it uses too much coffee). Finally, my old Cuisinart machine died, and I went looking for a replacement. I was looking for the ultimate machine that would get 5 stars; there isn't such a machine. The highest I found was the Chemex, which got 4 and a half stars(plus). I became intrigued, read ALL the reviews and went on to Utube to see how you are supposed to use this method. It's pretty simple; you heat up water to 200 or so degrees (I have a Cusinart electric pot I bought for tea which has a 200 degree setting), fold one of the special heavy duty chemex filters (and yes, use them, they really are better; that's half the reason this system works so well); others suggest you wet the filter; I agree, it seems to make things flow a little better) and put it in the top opening of the glass container. You put your coffee in (a tablespoon for each 5 oz is their recommendation), and put a slight indentation with your finger or something in the center of the coffee. You then pour just a little liquid in the center, then around the edges, gradually filling the cone with water (and raising the coffee off the cone). Gradually (don't just dump it in really quickly) pour all the water into the cone filter. It takes a minute or two for the water to drain down, but when it does, you have the best coffee you can possibly make. Of course, the quality of coffee is dependent on two other factors, one, a clean excellent water source, and two, FRESH (burr ground beans within a day or less for maximum taste) high quality coffee. This is not a machine per se, it is a method that has been tested for a bunch of years, and it really works. The downside is if you are in a hurry or you simply don't have time in the morning, this will not work for you as you have to have a few minutes and, most important, some patience. I have written over 350 reviews on products for Amazon, and this is, by far, my most enthusiastic euphoria with a product. It's like I found the magic bottle (glass), and it has fulfilled my wish (perfect coffee). You know, I've said so much (and so little when you analyze it), so here are a few final comments about the coffee produced. First, it is really smooth; it is absolutely NOT bitter at all, and it just looks clear and clean in a brown way. It's so good that my wife (I made her try it) who doesn't drink coffee even admitted it was very good (which coming from her is like a miracle). Clean up is very easy (other reviewers said this too); you just throw away the coffee in the paper filter and rinse the container out. I always rinse it right away, if you let it sit, you may have some problems cleaning it. The collar, two pieces of wood fitted around the neck of the glass, is held on by a rawhide cord; you can easily take this off (but why, if you just rinse out the unit each time, it is superfluous to mess with the collar). One more little trick I thought of (all by myself) is I heat the cup I am going to pour my coffee into with hot water prior to my putting the finished coffee into it. (And if I am putting in milk, I heat the milk to get it warm). This allows the coffee to be warm longer as when it comes out of the container as it isn't that hot (you can reheat it with a microwave, but I sometimes wonder if that does affect the taste). Oh, one more little thing, it says 6 cup, they are assuming a cup is 5 ounces, to me a cup is 8 ounces, so if you need a larger than say, 4 cups, go with a bigger size. Any comments are appreciated! Postscript: I also now use a double walled glass to put the prepared coffee in (16 ounce) as it keeps the coffee hot much longer (like up to 25 minutes, depending on how hot the coffee is to start). I also put dried egg shells in my filter before I put in the coffee; the egg shells help make the coffee even milder (if that is possible) and add a little calcium to the coffee, or so I have read. I take this all very seriously.",

Take the handles off and put it in the dishwasher. Normal cone filters work fine, but I recommend getting one of the reusable ones. The Chemex filters are nice but not required.",

                "reviewText": "this thing makes really good coffee, although it is a pretty involved process to actually use it. the filter papers for this are very thick, yielding a very clean, crisp cup of coffee without any grittiness or harsh flavors. it is a pain in the a** to use though; you have to use the official filters for this, as knockoff brands will not fit right, and you have to rinse the paper before brewing or else your coffee will taste like paper. the official filters are also really expensive and kind of wasteful, as they are huge and you can really only use it to brew one mug of coffee at a time. it does look nice, and it is pretty easy to clean after use (although if you want to put it in the dishwasher, you have to remove the wooden handles, and getting them back on is also a huge hassle). you also have to use quite a bit more beans with each cup than normal and you have to grind pretty finely unless you like your coffee very weak tasting. it can also be inconsistent; unless you brew the EXCACT same way every time, your cup of coffee will taste slightly different (this includes amount of coffee, coffee grind, amount of water, brewing time, blooming, and stirring). honestly, if you are looking to up your coffee's taste, i would first start with buying better coffee beans, and most importantly, grinding them fresh right before brewing (which is also a giant pain, but worth it in my opinion). you'll notice a much bigger difference doing that than you will using this device, even if you just use a normal automatic coffee brewer that you would see in like an office break room",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a coffee maker that was more compact and RV travel-friendly than my Nespresso Citiz. It was down to either Aeropress or Chemex but after a chat with my son (who has and uses both), Chemex seemed the better option. While I'm still experimenting, I will say that you do get a much smoother cup of coffee - there is just no bitter/acidic taste. In fact, I've rewarmed my coffee in the microwave (sorry gourmet coffee folks) and it still tastes great. I'm admittedly a bit nervous of keeping it warm on our flame stove but I'll likely try it at some point. I should also note that I am using the original Chemex natural filters for brewing. I love the wooden collar - little awkward to remove for washing but I quickly got the hang of taking it off/putting it back on. It does a great job of insulating your fingers to pour coffee while adding some real flair. I find the brewer washes up really easily but I always rinse it out immediately when it is empty. Some reviewers have mentioned the fragility of the Chemex but I find it very sturdy; it's been bumped a couple of times with no issues. Now let's talk design - did you know that the iconic Chemex has been exhibited in the MOMA? Even in my humble RV it looks beautiful on the counter with its simple elegance. I'm very happy with this purchase.",
