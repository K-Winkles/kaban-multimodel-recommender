                "reviewText": "This is a nice coffee maker! Like a lot of reviewers I\u2019m the only coffee drinker in the house so five cup in the morning is usually enough. I like to grind my beans and pods get expensive so a small pot works best for me. The Capresso is a nice size and fits under the kitchen cabinets. Although the clock and timer work well I don\u2019t use it. The water level step is an interesting design, I seldom make less than a full pot but once in a while I want one more cup and it\u2019s hard to see the lower steps. I do keep it in a darker corner of my counter so the water level and clock are a little harder to read. I\u2019ve been using it daily for about five months now with no complaints. I think the hot plate keeps coffee at the right temperature, doesn\u2019t burn the coffee if you leave it on to long. A little more than I wanted to spend but the quality is there and the cheap ones are just that.Well I guess I spoke to soon. Less than seven months and it died, stopped heating. The clock and timer work but I need coffee! I\u2019m not afraid to take things apart, they all work the same way. I did not find any shorts or fried wires. What I did find was the water level step was getting kind of nasty and due for a good cleaning. I really liked this coffee maker so do I try another one or move on to something else? I\u2019ll have a spare carafe and basket! I didn\u2019t change my rating but yeah, I\u2019m disappointed. Just more landfill.Final update; I did get ahold of customer service after being on hold for over an hour. The problem is I have to ship it to Pennsylvania. UPS shipping calculator came up with about $16.80 for shipping. I get it, they can\u2019t give a coffee maker to anyone willing to be on hold for a hour. I\u2019ve had bad luck with these small coffee makers so I went cheap and bought a SHARDOR for $17.99 + tax. So far it is working just fine!",

I replaced an old 4-cup coffee maker, which was fine for many years until it started leaking around the base. And quite often I wanted just one more cup. This 5-cup Capresso is perfect! It makes great coffee, and the pour spout is mess free. I like the water level indicator and the handle is sturdy and easy to hold, and the programmable features are a nice plus, and simple to use. I can\u2019t say anything negative about this cute little coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this for about an year now, so far it has held up fine. I chose to buy this one because:1. I had been using an AdirChef single cup coffee-maker but wanted to make more coffee in one go (for morning and for taking to work). The 5-cup size of this coffeemaker was perfect for my needs. Note about the size: The \u201ccup\u201d of 5-cup is a European measure, and it\u2019s also the standard for coffee-makers in the US. If you are going from 1-cup drip coffee-makers to this (like I did), don\u2019t expect it to make 5 times the amount of coffee from your one-cup coffeemakers. Here, 1 cup = 5 oz. As I drink from a standard 12 oz mug, for me it makes enough for 2-servings of coffee.2. Capresso is a relatively known/specialized brand for coffee equipments. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the best-ranked or anything, but it\u2019s just that personally, I feel more comfortable buying a coffee-maker from a company whose main business is coffee-related items, and not a variety of stuff from toothbrushes to exercise machines.3. It has a hot plate and an auto-shutoff. The coffee stays hot for two hours, and after two hours the machine shuts off automatically. I keep the coffee machine plugged to the wall and so far it has been completely safe. I haven't measured the temperature of the coffee, but freshly brewed it's very hot (at least, hot enough for my taste). On the hot plate, it's a little less hot (not steaming), but still good enough to take out and drink comfortably any time within the 2-hr mark.Other details:Coffee-filter: It comes with a reusable gold-tone filter, but I don\u2019t like cleaning it up everyday, so I use paper-filters (basket type, 4-6 cups). My taste-buds aren\u2019t refined enough to sense a taste-difference between this and the 1-cup coffee maker I had, and anyway it isn\u2019t a fair comparison because the sizes are different. The other coffee-maker I have is a moka-pot which makes much stronger coffee, again no way to compare tastes.The carafe: It\u2019s glass, therefore easy to clean. I don\u2019t have a dishwasher so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dishwasher-safe. But it\u2019s easy enough to clean by hand. Except, the glass is very light so it feels flimsy and fragile in your hand. I don\u2019t know how shock-resistant the glass is, and I have no intention of testing it. Other than that, I like the design of the carafe. It has volume markers, for both water and coffee. So you can use the carafe to fill your desired measure of water, knowing how much coffee it will produce (some water will be retained by the ground so the coffee will always be little less than the water). The lip of the carafe is well-designed and feels nice to pour from (doesn\u2019t spill).The stepwise cup markings inside the water-reservoir: These are very helpful for me because I can pour water directly from the water-filter and know the measurements. In my previous coffeemaker, I used to fill the carafe/mug with filtered water and then pour it to the coffee-maker\u2019s water reservoir, or just fill it to some random measure (which is very bad for making coffee). Having a measuring system inbuilt to the reservoir helps to bypass that step. I specifically like that it\u2019s inside the reservoir and not to the side like many other coffee-makers, because I have very little space in my apartment so I don\u2019t have to free the side of the coffee-maker to be able to see the markings.The 24-hour programmable timer: I like to grind my coffee just before brewing, so I haven\u2019t tested this feature.Overall, I like this coffee maker. The one negative is that there is always some drops of coffee falling to the hot plate as you remove the carafe. It badly affects the smoothness of the \u2018pause\u2019 function. At first I was worried about the coffee droplets on the hot plate, but as I said in the beginning, so far it hasn\u2019t caused any problem.",
