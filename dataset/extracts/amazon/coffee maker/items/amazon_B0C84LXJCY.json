            "Hot and Iced Coffee at the Touch of a Button - While some mornings you prefer an iced coffee, there are colder mornings when a hot cup of coffee sounds great. No matter what your mood is, this single serve coffee maker always delivers a great cup of coffee. Not strong enough? Simply press the \"strong\" button to make the cup stronger or even use the strong setting to save on ground coffee for making a regular coffee.",
            "Fresh, Non-watery Iced Coffee - By pressing the \"OVER ICE\" button, this iced coffee maker brews a strong cup of hot coffee directly on ice so when the ice melts, it's just the right concentration. Pouring regular coffee over ice can leave it tasting watery, and chilling coffee in the fridge takes time and can cause it to oxidize, affecting its flavor.",
            "2-in-1 for K Cups and Ground Coffee: For strong coffee lovers, the coffee brewer comes with a large reusable ground filter basket that holds up to 1.1oz of ground coffee, which is three times more coffee than a pod. Meanwhile, this single coffee maker also has the ability to brew pods. When making iced coffee from a pod, be sure to only use a 6 oz.",
            "Multi-Cup Size Available & Removable 30oz Water Reservoir - You can choose to brew 6, 8, 10, 12, or 24 oz of your favorite coffee, tea, or iced beverage, making this 4 cup coffee maker suitable for real coffee lovers or anyone hosting a tea party with friends. 24 oz coffee is always paired with \"STRONG\" mode and a maximum of ground coffee (1.1 oz) is added to ensure the correct coffee concentration and flavor. The large water tank allows you to make 5 cups before needing a water refill.",
            "Instant Heat Up Technology - This coffee machine brews a cup very quickly - from the moment you press the button, to having a piping hot 6 oz cup of coffee in your hands, it's just 90 seconds!",
            "Fits Most Cup Sizes: You can use mugs between 5 to 6.5 inches tall in this hot and cold coffee maker by placing drip tray in its normal postion or placing it upside down. However, to fit taller mug, you also can remove the dirp tray, but please make sure that the coffee in the mug is not full, otherwise the coffee will be splashed easily when you take off the mug.",
            "Hot Coffee 175\u00b0F or Higher: Water quickly heats to the right temperature, helping to extract flavor and strength from perfectly ground coffee, giving you a great-tasting cup straight or with milk.",
            "Easy to Clean: The built-in descale reminder will notify you to clean the machine by displaying an alternate red light on the \"REGULAR\" and \"STRONG\" buttons. You can then press these 2 buttons at the same time for 2 seconds to start the self-clean process after adding 14 oz. descaling solution. The ground basket is also dishwasher safe.",
            "Memory Function Automatically Brews the Last Cup Size: This smart coffee maker has a memory function to remember your preferred cup. For example, if you selected an 8 oz cup last time, the next time you turn on the machine, it will automatically and conveniently brew an 8 oz cup so you don't have to select the size each time.",
            "Safe to use: Whenever there is no water or not enough water in the tank or when the top cover is not properly closed, the coffee pod maker will stop working to ensure safety every time you use it."

But once you get in the habit of refilling it isn\u2019t that big a deal. I love this way better than the overpriced Keurig machines that for us, broke after a year of heavy use.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent coffee maker where you can use both k-cups and brew regular coffee. The coffee brews quite fast, brews hot and does not taste watered down. I never used the ice coffee feature so cannot comment on how it works. There is some splash while its brewing, but nothing more than any other k-cup machines.Sadly the coffee maker broke after two weeks. Steam started to come out of the middle section between the water reservoir and coffee insert when I tried to brew a cup, then it would make a sound like it was possessed and have seizure with all the lights blinking. Luckily it was still under warranty and once I was able to bypass Amazon Customer Service (not the best experience) and deal directly with the manufacturer, their customer service was great!Even though the machine broke in such a short amount of time, I\u2019m giving the review 5 stars because the Famiworth Customer Service does deserve it.They were quick to answer the request once I emailed the video of the defective machine to their support email, worked with Amazon to send me a replacement and it arrived within two days of contacting them.Will see if the replacement coffee maker lasts longer because I really do prefer it to the Keriug .",

Contacted Manufacturer got a reply the next day. 2 or 3 back and forth testing they decided it was defective and asked if I wanted a refund or replacement. I went for replacement due to the good cust service they responded on a Sunday that a new one was on its way. Tuesday we got our new unit and it seems to work well. I would buy from this manufacturer again just from their fast resolution of our defective unit.",

                "reviewText": "The coffee maker arrived quickly as usual with Amazon. The device was well-packaged. It includes an excellent instruction manual. I will operate this coffee using the provided grounds holder, probably never with an actual K pod. Before anything else, I carefully washed the detachable pieces.Now for some performance tests -First - output water volumes. Does it give you the quantity of water output as selected with the 'Size' button? There are five options, each in ounces: 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24. I tested all but the 24 oz. setting. For each of the four smaller settings the water output was consistently about 1.5 ounces above the value selected. Note that I was running these tests with no coffee in the grounds holder. So I'm guessing that the engineers planned for about 1.5 ounces of water to remain soaked into the coffee grounds. Makes sense, I think.Second - water temperature. Coffee aficionados suggest the best temp for coffee brewing is 195 to 205 degrees F. In my test, for the first 6 oz. cup, the water temp rose quickly to about 188 to 190 degrees F until near the very end of the cycle where it got up to about 194. Subsequent test runs gave slightly higher initial temps, around 192 to 194 degrees rising to 195 to 196 near the end. My conclusion - during the first test run with cool plumbing inside the device, some heat gets lost warming up the pipes. Second and subsequent runs with a warm coffee maker produced output temps slightly higher. So it might be wise for your first cup in the morning to run the coffee maker with no grounds or K-cup through a 6 oz. cycle to warm things up. Then put in the coffee and run a cup for drinking purposes. But I will say that I did not do this pre-warming technique for my first actual 8 oz. cup the morning after I bought the device. It was stone cold yet it made a very good cup of coffee running it on the \"Strong\" mode. So maybe a pre-warming cycle will be of little benefit. End of my tests.Overall product quality - Famiworths (actually Intertek) lost one star here. Our ancient Keurig B70 had recently bought the farm thus my need for a similar but operating device. That Keurig was a beast (i.e., quite heavy) and worked quite well for many years. My wife bought it at a tag sale for 5 bucks (Amazon take note). The Famiworths is pretty darn light. Will it last? Can't say quite yet. It does look and feel well made. The only weak element I noticed was the grounds holder furnished with the coffee maker. It has a slender hinge on the lid, and that hinge is very light duty. I ordered a spare just in case disaster strikes. Of course, this would only be a first world disaster not like an event in, say, Haiti, where a severe thunder storm could collapse a hillside destroying every coffee maker in town.But more on my spare grounds cup - The grounds cup was ordered on Amazon. Is it the right one? This cup ($12.99 - overly costly - Amazon take note) is described as a 'Replacement K Pod Holder Only for Model 2220'. In the picture it is not a K Pod Holder. It looks just like the grounds cup that comes with this coffee maker. I submitted a note to Amazon about this so they can correct the ad as necessary. That cup has not arrived yet so I can't be certain what cup version might be coming my way. It's a virtual thrill a minute awaiting such deliveries.My summation - This coffee maker looks nice, makes pretty good coffee (in spite of the 'low' water temperature), runs quietly, is simple to use and has the capability of easing the weighty burden of your coffee brewing process every morning. The grounds holder filters the coffee quite well allowing almost zero grounds to get through. Nice. You can make a reasonable-sized travel mug of coffee for your drive to work. Equally nice. You could also easily use it to heat water for a cup of tea. It comes with a one year warranty and the booklet with the device tells me their customer service folks are eager to help us lowly coffee drinkers. Eager customer service folks are always preferred. And, last, the front end cost was fairly low, just not quite at the price of our former tag sale Keurig. Amazon, take note.Two Month Report - The Famiworths self-terminated. All the LEDs and buttons begin blinking furiously. And no hot coffee produced. Nothing I did resolved this problem. Of course, it was outside the one month normal Amazon 'return-it-for-any-reason' period, but I reached a very kind Amazon customer service fellow. He allowed me to process a return for a refund. Thanks, Amazon. The coffee maker was great while it lasted. But seeing as our $5 tag sale Keurig lasted about ten years, I'd say Famiworths has not quite hit the gold standard yet for reliability. Not quite sure what I am going to do next.PS. Dropped my rating to 1 star.",
