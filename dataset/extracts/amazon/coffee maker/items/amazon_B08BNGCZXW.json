I prefer the flavor of cone-dripped coffee, and this well-sized machine makes a pot much faster than my old one, while taking up less space. It has a really great carafe with an excellent spout for pouring, and even with the \"BOLD\" switch turned on, delivers fast results. I tried out programming a start time and it was perfect. I'm very happy with this coffee-maker, especially since it cost me a lot less than I was expecting to have to pay.",

It\u2019s not leaking, easy to program, not expensive but at this rate it\u2019s not gonna last long. Not sure what to do about it, is it really obvious? It\u2019s brand new, and i\u2019m nuts without my coffee.",

                "reviewText": "Coming from a $20 coffee pot this is a nice upgrade. Keeps the coffee hot but not scalding, quick brew. I like the programmable time setting but it was a bit tricky to figure out how to change it after setting. Only other complaint is that the area to pour water in the reservoir is a bit tight on the right side and I often end up getting water where I don't want it. Besides that good coffee pot, happy with my purchase.",

But coffee grounds build up all around the sides of the basket and underneath, and it's a pain to clean the sludge out, and after a while it effected the taste of the coffee. The water overflowed out of the top several times when I made a full pot. It stopped working completely this morning - 7 months to the day after I bought it. Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions but nothing helped.",
