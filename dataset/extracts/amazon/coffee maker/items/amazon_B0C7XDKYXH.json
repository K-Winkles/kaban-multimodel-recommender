                "reviewText": "My father was a coffee salesman, so I\u2019ve been drinking coffee over 50 years, a tradition I\u2019ve passed on to our children as well. I previously owned an earlier model of the Ninja which brewed perfect cups of coffee 4 to 8 times a day for over seven years before that sad day came when it was time to retire it and search for a new coffee maker.I was hoping to buy the same model, but it had been long discontinued. I searched for the new Ninja models and settled upon the CFP101. It has not disappointed. An unexpected benefit was the ability to brew K-cups as well. We host a small house church in our home on Sundays and it\u2019s difficult to predict how much coffee to brew. Living in the Pacific Northwest, I\u2019ve become somewhat of a coffee snob and only buy locally roasted coffees. I hate wasting those precious grinds so having a Kcup option for the church has worked out wonderfully. No more pouring out half-full pots of coffee.My only complaint is that the coffee pot mouth is a little too wide. If I get too ambitious with my pour, it often misses my cup and spills out onto the counter. I\u2019ve compensated by pouring more slowly so it isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me.I highly recommend this machine to my fellow coffee lovers.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Ninja coffee machine. My first machine has a second brew basket for tea, a frothier and a metal carafe. I have had it for about 4 years and it still works very well. I bought this one because I wanted the k cup option and I liked the many options it offered. It makes outstanding coffee. I do believe it is as good as a Hario V60\u2013 which is the gold standard for coffee excellence. I have tried k cups but the taste is not as good. I buy only coffee beans and grind them just before brewing them. K cups use coffee that was ground months or even years before they used. There is no doubt that freshly ground coffee is the best. And this Ninja coffee machine Brews this freshly ground coffee to perfection.",

                "reviewText": "First, lets get the negative vibe about Ninja coffee makers out of the way. Do they have some problems? YES I myself had one that went bad in 6 months. So I just bought another one. People don't stop buying cars because of breakdowns. Purchase the extended warranty if you are worried. Don't let negative reviews stop you from buying the best coffee maker on the market. This model is by far their best. It brews great coffee. SUPER easy to clean. I use it both as a drip and a pod. The pod of course is very limited so I use it mostly as drip. The temp is right on for making good coffee. I have learned that cleaning can make a major difference taking care of any coffee pots. Maybe more with Ninja. I have hard water so I clean mine once a month. Have had no problems so far. Give it a try. It won't dissapoint!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This machine failed epically on the very first use right out of the box. The second one I captured on the video posted to this review, the first cup was definitely worse. Out of the first 3 pods I tried, only one was ok but the coffee tasted bad.Once I opened the outer box the product box was inside, the tape on the inner box was applied when it was in the outer box and the bags inside were torn and not packed like a manufacturer would do, I assume this was already returned for the same reason I returned it for since it appeared I was not the first person to open this package.I followed directions right from the manual step by step and used several different brands of pods all produced similar results. This machine is not capable of performing the primary function, the very reason it was created to brew a cup of coffee. This is the second model ninja that is incapable of producing a cup of coffee that is not full of grounds. To be clear I'm not talking a few specks in the bottom of the cup, I'm talking emptying the majority of the pod content into the cup. I will sadly never have enough trust to buy another ninja project again.",

                "reviewText": "We had been using a Hamilton Beech combination coffee maker, but we're disappointed with how flimsy it was constructed. The lid for the caraf coffee chamber warped to the point that it could no longer function. Also, with a built in water reservoir, if you accidentally over filled it on the k-cup side, it would refuse to function. We didn't hate it, but we needed something else. This Ninja machine is much sturdier in its construction. There are more parts do deal with, but they fit so well and have a place to store them. The seperate and removable water reservoir is so convenient. So far, we are happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I have very different morning routines, I get up for work 3 hours before her. I used to make a pot of coffee and the remainder would be cold and old by the time she got upthis makes it easy to adjust the amount of coffee made, and strength. Also iced coffee if wanted. You don\u2019t need to buy the expensive k cups but can use them if you likeYou can also set a timer which is very nice. I can make my coffee for work then set another batch to brew up for my wife when she\u2019s getting ready\u2026. Happy wife\u2026happy life!!",

It\u2019s taking me a bit to get used to the settings but wow it\u2019s wonderful. And since I live alone it\u2019s great to get a delicious single cup (I use grounds although there is a an adaptor for k-cups)! Don\u2019t hesitate with this one!",
