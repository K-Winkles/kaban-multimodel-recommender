                "reviewText": "Sometimes you just want coffee. This coffee maker fits that bill. Simple, fast, reliable, good coffee.Most drip style coffee makers work pretty much the same way. They have a little plastic one-way valve in a tube that lets cold water flow in (towards a heating element). When the water reaches that heating element, it heats and expands. Since it cannot go backwards, it goes forwards - through the tube, up, and out into the coffee grounds. More (cold) water then flows in through that little plastic valve, until all the water has been heated and ejected through the coffee grounds.The problem is with that little plastic valve. It can get \"dirty\" over time, so that it no longer properly prevents water from going backwards. Once water can flow backwards through that valve, it has no need to flow forwards. Brew times increase, and eventually stop altogether.While there is a lot of info all over the internet about how to remove, clean, and reinstall this little valve, you still have to do it - or replace the entire coffee maker.After contemplating doing this teardown yet again on my last coffee maker, I decided \"No more\", and bought this one.This type of coffee maker works differently. There is no valve to malfunction. The water is heated ahead of time, and kept warm until you want a pot of coffee. Then, you pour a pot of cold water in. That water flows in in such a way that it \"pushes\" the already hot water out and over the grounds, resulting in a very fast pot of coffee (3-4 minutes).There are no timers, clock, bells, or whistles on this one. Just a single switch that you leave on (unless going away for days). The brew process simply \"starts\" when you close the filler lid - so just make sure the pot is in place before closing the lid :)",

                "reviewText": "After owning several coffee makers over the years, all with the requisite bells and whistles, I was really looking for something simple and fast. This Bunn is perfect for us.It doesn\u2019t have a built in timer because one isn\u2019t needed. I just get it ready at night, leave the fill lid open, and flip the lid down in the morning. By the time I\u2019ve fed the cat and taken my meds, I have a full pot of hot coffee. The thermal carafe is well insulated - will keep coffee plenty hot for a couple of hours.Be sure to use the Bunn filters if you are used to brewing a full carafe, as those are slightly deeper & may save you from cleaning up an overflow mess.",

                "reviewText": "For the last several years, I've had a fancy \"grind & brew\" coffee machine. When it quit on me, I almost re-ordered the same machine because it was familiar, fancy and high end. I figured, grinding my own beans seconds before they were brewed had to make the best possible cup of coffee. Then I had coffee at my sister's house, made with a Bunn Speed Brew coffeemaker (different model), and I realized my fancy \"grind and brew\" coffee machine didn't make very good coffee at all. And the more I thought about it, it made sense. That fabulous cup of joe from the local diner is made with a Bunn machine. The convenience store \"air pot\" coffee is made with a Bunn machine. Most likely the after dinner cup from your favorite high-end restaurant is made with a Bunn machine. So I bought the Bunn Speed Brew Platinum Thermal Coffee Maker, and I couldn't be happier. I use knock-off \"donut shop\" blend coffee from my local warehouse club store, Bunn brand coffee filters (a must, because they're taller and you need that for this machine) and plain old tap water and I get a rich, dark, complex cup of coffee every time.I bought the thermal carafe style because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house and I didn't want my coffee \"cooking\" on the burner all day. It keeps the coffee piping hot for a few hours, long enough for me to get through most of the pot. There is no heating element/burner on this model. The glass carafe models have a warming burner, so I can't speak to that.And FAST! This machine makes a full pot of coffee in about three minutes. It has a reservoir that keeps water at a temperature just off the boil at all times, so when you fill the machine with cold water, the hot water is displaced out of the reservoir and immediately starts to brew your coffee. There is no \"brew stop\" feature on this machine, so you have to wait for the entire pot to brew before you can serve yourself, but with a three-minute brew time start to finish, waiting is hardly a problem.Highly recommend this and other Bunn fast brew products.",

                "reviewText": "Question for the people saying this takes 15-20 minutes to brew a pot of coffee, are you following the instructions properly? You're supposed to leave the power button for the water heating element ON all the time. If you turn it off after every pot, then yes, it's going to take 15-20 minutes to warm back up. This isn't a traditional coffee maker that needs to be turned ON and OFF. Leave it on and you get a pot of coffee in three minutes.Had a commercial Bunn in our house for about 12 years before it passed away. Loved it, but that sucker was huge and I had to disconnect the warmer plates so we could use a thermal carafe instead of the glass ones that came with it. This model gives the simplicity of that commercial brewer with a MUCH smaller footprint, no warmer plates, and a thermal carafe. Works just as well so far. Makes excellent diner-style coffee. If you're looking for some barista Starbucks brew, this isn't your machine.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this model to replace my Bunn velocity brew, which I had previously owned for about 10 years. I wanted the update of the thermal carafe to stop throwing away coffee that has been on the burner too long. This coffee maker makes excellent coffee very quickly - full pot brews in about 3 1/2 minutes. The carafe works very well to keep my coffee very hot for two hours and drinkably hot for up to 4 hours. I am very pleased with this product and love Bunn coffee makers in general. I had my doubts about the ability of the carafe to keep coffee hot, but no worries - the coffee stays hot and I am throwing away a lot less coffee now. Love it very much.",

We have been using our Speed Brew for a month now and gone is the bitter taste we had become used to. After experimenting on a few different coffees the determination is this coffee maker will give you the very best of whatever beans you choose.A side note about the insulated steel carafe, we had always had a glass carafe which stayed warm on a heat plate. The Bunn Carafe is very good at keeping coffee hot and the fact you can bring it to the breakfast table without loosing heat is a plus.",
