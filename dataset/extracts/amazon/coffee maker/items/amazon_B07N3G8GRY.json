It makes great coffee and it\u2019s easy to use and also my husband and I love the single cup feature, but if he wants a 2nd cup it only takes a couple of minutes as it heats up quickly.I would purchase this brand and style again and I would highly recommend it.",

Instructions weren't quite right (thought we had to push buttons twice instead of once) but once we figured it out, worked great.",

                "reviewText": "My first Keurig finally stopped working. My late husband and I had received it as a gift. It was small and really worked well. We had it eleven years, so it was time for a new one. I decided on the Keurig mini since it\u2019s now just and I only use coffee pods this was perfect. Well it has a few quirks and I wondered if any other customers who purchased this mini Keurig had similar issues.First it is loud when I first start it and it\u2019s heating the water. Then as it\u2019s dispensing the coffee into a cup small drops of coffee go all over and I\u2019m wiping it up after I brew. No complaints I don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s possible its splashing out of the cup as the coffee comes out quite fast. Lastly after you place the pod and pull the lid over it, it seems not to go down all the way. I hear the snap of the pod being opened on top and bottom, but there seems to be a small opening. It just close all the way as my old Keurig did. The coffee brews just fine but I\u2019m curious about that.Otherwise the Keurig mini is a great little, coffee, tea, cappuccino and hot chocolate machine. There are so many great K cups on the market you can never get bored.Update November 12The mini brewer stopped working I put water in, put the pod in, placed the cup, pushed the button to brew it took the water out of the reservoir but it didn\u2019t brew. I tried again and nothing . To say I\u2019m disappointed is an understatement. I\u2019ve only had this three months and already it stopped working.I called Keurig and they were helpful, they sent me an email with instructions how to get another one.Honestly I\u2019m not sure I want another one. I think there was something wrong with the unit because it was so noisy when I turned it on to brew. I\u2019ll post when I get the replacement, which will be the exact same one! I didn\u2019t want a fancy replacement just note this exact one, I offered to pay the difference to upgrade to a different mini brewer, but it\u2019s under warranty so I have to get the same one. I\u2019ll update when I receive it and try it it out.",

However this machine has sort of a delay while it\u2019s heating the water. It doesn\u2019t bother me but be aware the higher end Keurigs don\u2019t have this delay. There were a couple times I must not have put enough water and had to add some to get it to brew. It\u2019s a solid machine and I am happy with my purchase but when it dies eventually I would rather have the mini plus because it has a strong button and a removable reservoir for easier cleaning and cost only a little more. In retrospect I wish I had got the Keurig K mini plus.",

It\u2019s so much cleaner looking than my older bulkier machine. That being said the only complaint I have is that the coffee is never truly hot and I always have to pop the cup in the microwave to get it hot enough. Not a dealbreaker for the price but in the future I may purchase another brand. I do love the convenience of the single cup brewer though.",

                "reviewText": "Love Keurig products - decided to order one for our flat in India. Even ordered some local flavor K-cups. Plugged into the wall and heard a loud bang. And a bunch of circuits went kaput - and the machine does not work after that in any outlet. I think it's only meant to work in 110V settings.",
