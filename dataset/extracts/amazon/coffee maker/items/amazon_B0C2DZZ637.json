                "reviewText": "I bought this black and decker coffee maker because I\u2019ve always had b&d coffee makers and had zero problems with them lasting for years. I currently have one at home that I love, however I purchased this one for our trailer and the first time I used it was disastrous. The basket doesn\u2019t line up with the carafe. Every time you insert the carafe, it pushes the drain from the basket off to the side. And every time you insert the carafe first then install the basket nice and straight so everything lines up, when you close the lid it bumps the basket and the drain on the basket doesn\u2019t line up with the carafe and coffee goes everywhere. The only way to use it is to install the basket and carafe then reach in and manually line up the drain with the carafe. I do love b&d coffee makers \u2026 but not this model.",
