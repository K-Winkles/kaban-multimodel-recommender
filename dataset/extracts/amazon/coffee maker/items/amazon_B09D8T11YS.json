                "reviewText": "This frother is great for frothing your milk and or mixing your drinks. When we first received this item, we used it to froth and mix drinks and it did so well! Once the battery went out and we replaced it, the cover did not stay on. However, I did not throw it away and kept using the item by holding it together, tying a rubberband on it or whatever... and it's still going hard! Cleaning the frother is as any hand held, difficult depending on what's on it. At times we mix our protein waffle mix and it does a great job but it cakes on the mixer. If you do not clean it right away, you may have to soak the end. We've upgraded to a Nespresso that came with it's on electric frother, so I take this one to work so I can make my own. Bougie, but who is saving on Starbuck's drinks with their Salted Caramel Cream Froth??? ME!",

                "reviewText": "This little hand held battery powered blender is exactly what I was looking for. My old one broke and I am very happy with this Zulay one. It takes 2 AA batteries and whisks quietly and smoothly in my cup without spilling my hot drink everywhere like other more powerful ones do. It's great for whisking milk, hot chocolate or other powder drinks for small quick whisking for one cup. I like how easy it is to use by pressing the button on the top of the blender which controls the on and off switch. It turns off as soon as you remove your finger or thumb from the switch, which allows easier control. The stand is very helpful not only for storing but also for draining the blender after it's washed. I also love the aqua colour which matches my other kitchen gadgets but it comes in a variety of colours too. I am very pleased with my new little hand blender and you will too. To open the lid of the battery, just gently pull on the tab on the top of the lid in the back of the blender. The lid should then pop open easily. It's really one of the best hand blender that I ever used, gentle yet powerful enough to mix my hot drink with ease. You will enjoy this blender just as much as I do everyday.",
