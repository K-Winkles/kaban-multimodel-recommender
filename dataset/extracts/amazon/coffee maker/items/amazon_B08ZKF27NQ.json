                "reviewText": "Makes really good espresso. Well made.Makes a little under 1 cup of espresso for me following the instructions of filling to just below the pressure relief valve. It is not true that it makes more than one cup. However that one cup is good when using some good fresh ground bean. I can tap to compact the espresso grounds a bit and it handles that fine, and they way it waits until the pressure is good before letting the steam and hot water run through the grounds at the right temperature makes it phenomenal. I love that the top is glass so I can see hen it is done. The materials are great, stainless steel! I have bought a lot of stove top espresso makers over the years, this one is the very best! As long as you understand it is going to make a little less than one measured cup at a time, you will be happy with it. I use a little timer plug in stove top with it so I don\u2019t have to worry about it sitting on the heat too long or forgetting it. That works really well for me.",

                "reviewText": "This worked well at first out of the box but within a couple weeks not so much. No I have to buy another model but this one is garbage. Even carefully limiting how much water it has, too much water leaks out the valve on the side and thus reduces the amount of water going through the grounds and up the tube to the top. Additionally, the extra valve on the top of the tube stem is a great idea but in practice it just creates a blockage that forces water and then steam out the valve on the side. This leads to only half a pot of coffee and a mess of water on the stove top. If you fiddle with that thing while it's cooking it helps -- but you should not have to stick a fork or spoon in there and it seems a little dangerous to do so. Finally, if it's not perfectly clean and perfectly threaded water and coffee leaks out through the threads. It's easy to keep clean but the threading is difficult to \"feel\" is perfect and if it's not perfect it just doesn't work at all. This thing is a good idea but a huge disappointment. I now have to buy another model and so would not recommend this one, though I wish I could",

It would\u2019ve been fine if I had the time to properly clean it with the right solution, since dish soap is a no-go. But with my hectic mornings, I don\u2019t really have time for any cleaning that isn\u2019t a quick rinse and pop in the dishwasher. This one is so easy to clean and so forgiving for busy, rushed mornings. Very easy to use and offers some excellent espresso!",
