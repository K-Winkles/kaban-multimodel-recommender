                "reviewText": "There were a few deal breakers about this coffee maker that ultimately led to me returning it. The first being that the carafe is poorly made; nearly every time I or my fiance poured a cup of coffee we would end up with a pool from the carafe on the counter...didn't matter how steep or shallow of the pour, a pool would form, the leak is coming from the gap between the flip-top lid and the ring around the lid so there is no way to stop it from leaking....simply a poor design.The next reason i returned it is because of it's functionality with the autobrew. When setting autobrew, you need to turn on the coffee maker to enable the autobrew function, ramping up the coffee maker as if i you are going to actually make coffee at that time. So essentially you are running the coffee maker twice and using twice as much electricity as you would need to be due to the rapid heating of the water.Customer support was unhelpful from Keurig, They seemed to struggle to understand when i called regarding the carafe issue. Also, they did not call me back after the department they were going to transfer me too that day was unavailable, so i had to call back a second time. Eventually when i got someone who sort of understood the issue, They did want to send me a new carafe, but i tried to help them understand that it is a design flaw, not an individual product defect...they didn't have an alternate carafe they could send me ( a better made one). This led to me returning the coffee maker. It did make pretty good coffee if you can get passed the increased expense in electricity and paper towel usage on top of an already expensive coffee maker.",

The people complaining about the grounds overflowing must be using an extra fine grind of coffee or something cause I\u2019ve never had that problem. Try a fine-medium grind people. And those complaining about the coffee pot really have me wondering if they\u2019ve ever poured a pot of coffee before. Everything works as it should. Period. The end.Looks quite elegant, it\u2019s quiet and most importantly, super convenient. Cheers.",
