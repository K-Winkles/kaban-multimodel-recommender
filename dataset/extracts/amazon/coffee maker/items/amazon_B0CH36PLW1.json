                "reviewText": "I recently wrote a review for this coffee maker after a hose on the inside split and it started leaking from the bottom after only 9 months. I sent a message to the seller and they responded quickly and tried to solve the problem by sending me the part. When they found out the part was on the inside they immediately offered to send a replacement machine. Customer service doesn't get any better than that. Based on my experience I can recommend doing business with them. The machine was fine and made great coffee until that hose split. For all I know the hose might have been faulty when it was put on at the factory.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a friend and while brewing the first cup of coffee, the machine gave off a burning plastic smell. She assumed that was normal and brewed a 2nd cup of coffee that afternoon. Both cups were rich and flavorful, no complaints. The following morning though, the machine wouldn't operate and the lights flashed on it.We tried contacting customer service five days ago and haven't heard back, so we've requested a refund. I know this item has good reviews so I didn't think twice to order it, but looking back I now see several one-star reviews exactly as mine. Maybe a handful of these have faulty motherboards or circuitry? I'm not sure but I wouldn't trust a replacement.I had this shipped overseas so returning and replacing is a big process- I really wish customer service could have responded.",
