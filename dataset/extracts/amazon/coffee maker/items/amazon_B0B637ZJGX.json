They did end up sending me a whole new item without returning the one with missing parts. Unfortunately the top to the coffee pot of the second one went missing anyways. The pieces were not meant to stay together well especially for smaller children who don't realize how rough they can be when handling items. We still make it work though and he still loves to use it and have his \"coffee\" with me in the mornings so I guess I can't really complain too much. But the plastic top to the coffee put could be a little more sturdy so it doesn't just go flopping off the pot at the slightest jerk of the item. I got it during a lightning deal though so I can't really complain too much. It was worth the $10 I paid for it even though a piece of it ended up falling apart rather quickly anyways.",

Now he can brew his own at the same time and no worry getting burnt by the hot water. This one actually drips into a toy carafe then he can pour into the little cups that come with it. I think it would break easy as it\u2019s only made of hard plastic but holding up so fat. It is a good item that goes with his play kitchen he like to play with while his parents work in their kitchen.",
