(I have had other filters that were too small) I appreciate that they come in a smaller package so I don\u2019t have to buy a 500 pack to get a good price. I also appreciate that they are available by subscribe and save.",

These are equal to if not better than the name brand. Fits the basket well, just the right height and a great value. Will definitely be buying these again",
