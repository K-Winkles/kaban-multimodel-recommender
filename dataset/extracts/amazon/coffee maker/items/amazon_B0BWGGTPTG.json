                "reviewText": "It's sleek and sexy, and I love the warmth that the wood accents bring to this coffee maker.My favorite options are the ones that allow for low-acid (less acidity in the flavor, but also less caffeine) + the Americano option when I insert an espresso pod.The first machine I got was actually broken, as it wasn't letting me do the initial cleansing cycle. But their customer service was quick to help me resolve it, and I was able to get a replacement unit.The Bruvi is great for anyone that can appreciate a good cup of coffee, but isn't so into it that they want the ritual of grinding beans each morning and using a scale and timer.The app is also great for letting you know when your brew is done (A good feature if you're making cold brew as it can take awhile), letting you know how much coffee you're drinking, and what coffee you've been brewing. I think they made this machine really simple in terms of refilling water, cleaning, and general operation.My only downside is that the pods are not accessible at local stores. Amazon has just a few selections of B-pods available. Their website does give you 20% off the pods if you set up a subscription though. Excited to try the green tea option when that releases next year!",

This is the perfect coffee and you can buy refillable pods for your favorite coffee. I can confirm it does drip but it is DEFINITELY worth rewashing the drip pan 1-2x/week. I was hesitant for the price as well but they frequently offer discounts which is when I snagged mine! The pods are also good, just can get a little pricey depending on how much coffee you drink.",

                "reviewText": "We have a Bruvi for the house and my husband, who is a bit of a coffee snob, had me buy one to keep at work on his desk. He could not stand the Keurig machine they have and needed something just as convenient. The minute his colleagues saw this stunning machine, everyone wants a coffee all the time -- no one wants the Keurig anymore. It's just as easy if not easier to use, and the coffee is not only delicious and premium, but there are so many more options you can make: hotter, low acid, cold brew, iced, espresso, Americano and of course, just regular coffee. And all of this in a multitude of sizes. It also helps that he can just throw the pods away and not have to open or separate them to discard correctly, thanks to their special pod that allows these to degrade in a landfill. Get one, cuz you will probably want one for everywhere you go.",

                "reviewText": "Editing my original 1 star review:Updating my rating to a 4 star after the interaction I had with customer service. I reached out to Bruvi directly because I didn\u2019t want a refund through Amazon, I really wanted this machine. They were quick to respond to my after hours support ticket (literally minutes after opening this morning) and on top of it responded multiple ways (email and text). They asked me to try one troubleshooting attempt and checked in immediately after to see if it worked. When I told them it still didn\u2019t dispense water they instantly shipped out a new product even though I purchased the item through Amazon and not through them directly. They tested and inspected it first and did the cleansing cycle to make sure everything was working correctly prior to sending to me. I haven\u2019t received it yet because this all just happened today, but I\u2019ll be back for another update on my review when I receive it and try it out!Rated 1 star due to the item being defective- Packaging was great and the machine is a beauty! Was really looking forward to this machine but I couldn\u2019t get past the cleaning cycle. It hums and then started blinking the tea and 10oz cup lights. I reached out to customer service, but haven\u2019t heard back yet. Will update how they handle when I hear back!",

Hopefully, they expand and keep coming out with more pods so that it\u2019s not as limited. Otherwise, it\u2019s great.",

The machine is attractive, feels extremely well-built, and the coffee legitimately tastes like it's coming from beans that are roasted with care and expertise.I've never owned a Keurig but have tasted enough of it to understand that it's garbage. More recently, I've been using a Jura Z6 and Nespresso Vertuo. I'd take the Bruvi over either of them for its simplicity, versatility, and flavor.If I had to identify flaws, I'm only finding two so far: 1) very limited pod selection (hopefully will change with time); 2) I would've preferred a real display to a bunch of light-up icons.",
