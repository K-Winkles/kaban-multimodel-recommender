We just started using pour over coffee makers about 3 months ago and this thing is everything i thought it would be, and more. Super easy clean up....not staining the glass container with ugly coffee or water spots (like my old coffee maker carafe). Filter system works great and the taste is outstanding.We no longer use drip or other electric coffee makers since purchasing this....highly recommend this product.",

I got this because I wanted a low tech option at the office\u2026that and I didn\u2019t want to share a keurig with anyone.The coffee is so potent using this. Equivalent to a French press BUT BETTER. It drips fast and it\u2019s easy to use. To clean it I advise using a bottle cleaner. Also invest in biodegradable drip filters. The filter for this product is good. But I buy the filter inserts for easy clean up and to MAKE SURE I don\u2019t get grinds in my coffee.This would make a great gift for coffee enthusiasts, campers, or those that appreciate low tech. Plus the design is stylish. I can\u2019t wait to bring this to work and prop it up on my desk.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Obviously the most well known pour-over glass coffee maker is the Chemix, but I actually think this Kavako coffee maker is, dollar for dollar, a better value. First, it's beautifully made with thick glass carafe with a genuine leather collar, which I actually prefer over the wood collar that comes with the Chemix - I can see the leather aging nicely over time. Second, it comes with the stainless-steel dripper, which has very fine mesh filter. Although I think I may end up using a paper filter on top of the metal filter because I noticed it filters out the coffee way too fast. Third, it's close to $10-20 cheaper than the comparable Chemix, and hey, who doesn't like saving money? I guess only little thing I would point out is that just like with any pour-over coffee maker of this shape, it's harder to clean the inside without having some sort of a bendable brush that reach the inside. Overall, I definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a rich flavorful coffee in the morning or anytime.",

I have a very small kitchen and wanted to make a coffee & tea area in my dining room to save my limited counter space.The filter is high quality and has produced smooth coffee consistently for the few days I\u2019ve used it.I recommend using a coarse grind if you\u2019re having an issue with grounds getting stuck in the filter.I love the simplicity and cleaning is a breeze, everything easily rinses out. I saw the cork didn\u2019t fit well in other reviews but mine fits great. I like the leather grip, it easily snaps on and off and fits securely. It feels high quality and adds a nice flair.Combined with an electric kettle I also bought on Amazon, I have fresh coffee in under 5 minutes that\u2019s actually kind of fun to make.This set up is pretty enough to leave out, and if it holds up, the purchase was well worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I have used a pour over coffee system for a few years and have also tried many filters over that time.Every filter made quick work of filtering coffee for the start of my day.Not all did it well. I expected to replace after time the filter where it's used every day but not several times a year.This filter is the only one I reorder. It leaves NO sediment at the bottom of the pot. That's rare. Makes quick work of filtering and if (a quick learning process) I clean the filter after every use with a brush and soak once a month in vinegar/water, dawn over night, this filter might even last a year. I am currently still using one bought May '23. That's a great product!",
