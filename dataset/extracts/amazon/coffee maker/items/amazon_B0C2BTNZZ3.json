                "reviewText": "I have been making my own cold brew for a year or so and had a different caraffe and strainer setup. It worked okay, the holes in the strainer were a bit large I think, so I had a lot of sediment, even with a coarse grind. On top of that, the caraffe was known for being fragile and one day my husband proved that theory, shattering it all over the kitchen when he barely bumped it. But we aren't here to talk about that disappointment. We are here to talk about the good cold brew this makes! Let me just say this strainer is much better already after making my first batch! Coffee is clear. The strainer is easy to empty and clean and the jar seems robust! I did see a review stating theirs broke, but I think it was due to heat shock. So note to self, no hot water in this one. I think the strainer and kids will also be compatible with other jars I have so I might be able to be brewing while I use one! That's a win win! The size is nice too. It will likely last us 2 days of cold brew worth. The value is good as well, when you look at the price of store bought cold brew at about $6 for the same amount you can make yourself, let alone the cost at a coffee chain. Look up how to make cold foam and you're set!",

I got the 64oz and it\u2019s perfect to last a few days. It has very thick glass so it won\u2019t break easy and the filter where you put the coffee grounds have the perfect size holes so none of the grounds go into your coffee like the other ones I\u2019ve bought. Highly recommend",

Literally haven\u2019t purchased ice coffee since getting this!Coffee tastes so much better, fresher and stronger than the watered down ones I use to buy ! I am saving money and getting a nice fresh cup of ice coffee every day!My only complaint is I had to buy a mixing spoon separately. It is much needed in order for the coffee grains to be evenly distributed inside the metal piece but other than that in My eyes this product is a win win !! \ud83d\udc4d",
