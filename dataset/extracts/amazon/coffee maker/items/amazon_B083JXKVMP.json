                "reviewText": "I have been drinking ice coffee exclusively for about 15 years and buy whole beans and grind with a burr grinder. I had the queen of ice coffee makers (OXO) for many many years. It worked well even after my daughter knocked it off the counter and cracked the bottom part of the brewing container. After many years it has started to leak; the seals have worn away. I was looking for another iced coffee maker that could make about 32 Oz of dark concentrate iced coffee. I tried. Few of the infusion type available on Amazon and these type just can\u2019t make concentrate no matter how long it is left to brew. If you want concentrate don\u2019t bother with those. The water and coffee have to have a face to face meeting - anything else just doesn\u2019t do the trick. Next I turned to French press style. I have always resisted this type due to my exp with hot brewing French press- ie super weak coffee. I bought this unit and after some exp I am pleasantly surprised and a bit delighted with it. I grind and fill it up with about 3 inches of coffee and leave it on the counter over night with the regular lid. Next day I put it in the fridge and let it set for another day. Then I switch the lids and press. I tried pouring it into another container at that point but there was too much coffee sludge. So now I leave it alone and just pour it from the press. No residue at all. When there is a few servings left I pour it out slowly into another container leaving the residue behind. It is easy to clean and I repeat the process. It makes a surprisingly large amount of concentrate and is actually easier to use than than the OXO and I use half the amount of coffee now to make just a bit less than I did with the OXO. It is a little big in the fridge so you need a wide space for it. I haven\u2019t tried the other French press style ice coffee brewers so I cannot compare, but this one works great, is super inexpensive, uses less coffee grounds and is easy to clean. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this pitcher for about 4 months now. This has truly been a money saver for me. I drink coffee nearly every day, multiple times a day, so going out for coffee stopped being realistic and cold brew from the store skyrocketed in price. Which is when I bought this.The container itself is pretty slim and fits well in my busy fridge. Pretty self explanatory to use, drop the beans in, add water, I typically stir the beans to make sure they all get saturated, add the lid, and sit overnight. The least amount I\u2019ve let them sit was about 5 hours, most about 2 days \ud83d\ude05 use the plunger piece, push the grounds down, and pour.Some \u201ccons\u201d people may have. This does use a lot of grounds. I fill up the beans to the top of the black trim, not sure how many cups or anything that is. I normally buy winco brands seasonal bags ($5) with a high caffeine bag, half and half the two, and both those bags last me about 5-6 fills in the pitcher. Which, to me, is still worth it, because it\u2019s significantly less expensive then the other options.Also, occasionally the grounds will come up through the plunger piece, especially if you go up and down with it several times. I\u2019ve learned to just rinse the plunger off and it\u2019ll push all the grounds back down again.And finally, like I said, I drink a lot of coffee. I have a 24oz cup, one pitcher lasts maybe 3-4 cups worth of coffee before I have to refill it, which sometimes is one day. So it is a little small, but it makes enough for what the purpose is, and if you\u2019re a single person or the only one drinking coffee in your house, it\u2019s definitely a nice buy.Overall, this is probably the best purchase I\u2019ve made in the last 6 months. The coffee has great taste, very rich, and easy to use. I would definitely buy another if the one I have ever breaks, and would recommend one to any of my cold-brew drinking friends.",

Since I prefer my coffee hot, I really wasn't sure what to expect as I didn't know much about the process. When I received it, I realized that this is really just a large french press, which I have a couple of. I guess I could have just used one of those, but this is quite a bit larger than what I have. I also got it at a really good price so I'm not going to complain. Just thought I'd note that for any other newbies. I followed the directions and the brew came out really nice. The taste was on point and there were no grounds floating around. It was super easy to clean and appears to be made really well as it feels sturdy. Like I said, it's large, but doesn't take up too much room if you put it in the refrigerator. I'm actually pretty happy with it and have started to enjoy that taste of the cold brew myself.",
