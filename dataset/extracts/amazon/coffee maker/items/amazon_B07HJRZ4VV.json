Other than that it delivers a piping hot pot of excellent coffee just as did the older model..For my needs & purposes I give this machine a 9.9 of 10",

I like the swing away coffee filter area, I think it makes it a little easier to remove the old one, the program button lights up green when set so it's easy to tell when you have a horrible memory like I do. One of the things that impressed me the most is the automatic stop feature when you pull out the carafe; didn't leak a single drop, even mid brew, which most coffee makers still do. There's not much to a regular drip coffee maker so I can only say so much. I am happy with the price, features, and I would recommend.",

I'm talking too hot from the instant it hit the carafe. A minute after it was made you could smell the coffee burning. Not this one. It was fast, smelled great, tasted great. It has a small counter footprint, and the carafe doesn't drip every time you pour. Basket is swing out and lift, it'll take me a bit to get used to but it's not a thing, Easy to program, auto shut-off is great. Well worth the price,",

                "reviewText": "They must have recently changed the design on this listing, because this is the most annoying brewer in the world. How its achieved its high review status is beyond me.Here are the redeeming qualities:1. I was able to get it next day, free shipping, thanks to Prime. Yeah. That was pretty cool.2. It makes coffee.The annoying things:1. The reservoir is sealed off. You have to slowly pour the water into this half inch, by 4 inch opening. Which means, you could NEVER clean the reservoir if you expected it needed it.2. The heating element shuts off after like an hour or something. This is not 'unique' to this product. I've tried another programmable bot, that did the same thing. WHY?!?!? Nothing more annoying, then waking up at 7, brewing some coffee, then when you go for your third cup at 9, its cold!3. Its near impossible to pour without spilling. This has to do with how the spout is designed I guess. If you barely tip it over, and let the water or coffee just trickle out the end, yeah, i think you can get by with just a couple drops slipping out and hitting the counter/floor/foot. But, if you do a 'regular' pour, you end up with at least an ounce of liquid spilled on the counter or floor or foot. So annoying. Makes me what to throw the whole thing out my window at 7 am.4. The handle feels \"weird\". I don't know how to describe it. I'm a bit of a 'coffee slut' so I've handled my 'fair share' of coffee pot handles. And this just feels very strange. Like someone without hands designed it. Pretty weird.I hope my review was helpful. Don't buy this pot.",

                "reviewText": "For a couple dollars more, we could have gotten the coffee maker (sounds like \u201cFister Toffee\u201d \ud83d\ude09) of the same brand to replace the one that just died\u2014the button stopped working. My husband and I did a lot of back-and-forth about trying another coffee maker\u2026 He makes the coffee! This one seemed like a good thing because the water front-loads, and it makes 12 cups of coffee. The coffee is hot though we found we needed to put a little extra coffee in because it wasn\u2019t strong enough.There are so many downsides to this coffee maker: first, the handle on the carafe is lightweight. It does not feel like it will last very long. This is a problem, of course, because it is holding really hot liquid. Second, half of the time when pouring coffee, it drips. I don\u2019t know why, but my other coffee maker did not. The front loading area for the water is not real big, so you can\u2019t just pour the water in all at once, but have to pour it in more slowly. This is an issue if you\u2019re in a hurry. There is a spot at the top of the handle on the carafe, where we usually would hold the other carafe: but in this Proctor Silex model, there is steam coming out at the top of the handle where the lid joins the carafe and so I burned my thumb. Next, the coffee maker itself is lightweight and cheap: so when you try to return the carafe onto the \u201chot plate,\u201d it pushes the whole coffee maker back on the counter and you need two hands to secure the carafe onto the hot plate. For some, that may not seem like a big deal, but I have never needed a second hand to complete this simple task\u2026 Finally, we are used to loading both our water and our coffee filter (with coffee) at the top. No mess and no fuss. This brand requires that you pull the coffee basket that holds the filter out to the side. I did this because there were a lot of little grounds in my coffee today, and I wanted to see if the filter had collapsed. The filter had not fallen, but the coffee maker commenced to drip coffee all over my countertop. To save a few bucks, I feel that we disrupted our happy coffee morning ritual. This puppy is going back!",
