The K-Cafe coffee, latte, and cappuccino maker is one of the latest brewer innovations from Keurig. With the K-Caf\u00e9 coffee maker you can brew your favorite coffee or make creamy lattes and frothy cappuccinos using any K-Cup pod. What types of pods are compatible with the Keurig K-Caf\u00e9 coffee, latte, and cappuccino maker? The K-Caf\u00e9 coffee maker brews Keurig K-Cup pods. It does not brew K-Carafe pods, K-Mug pods, Vue pods, or Rivo pods. Can I use the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter with the K-Caf\u00e9 coffee, latte, and cappuccino maker? Yes, the K-Caf\u00e9 coffee maker is compatible with the Keurig My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter. Does the Keurig K-Caf\u00e9 coffee, latte, and cappuccino maker have auto off? Yes, the Keurig K-Caf\u00e9 coffee maker will automatically turn off 2 hours after the last brew. You can disable the auto off feature if you wish to keep the coffee maker on all the time. See the Use & Care Guide for instructions on how to disable. I ran the frother but the milk didn\u2019t froth. Is my machine broken? If the frother ran its cycle without any issue, then it could be an issue with the milk you are using. Due to the wide variety of milks sold in the United States, individual frothing results may vary.",

                "reviewText": "Sooo, I haven\u2019t been a soda or juice drinker for years. My choices have essentially been water, coffee, or alcoholic bevvies. I\u2019ve also never been a fancy coffee person. At home I had a standard keurig. When out I order the occasional cappuccino or latte which I\u2019d enjoy as a splurge.Well - Due to some health stuff I have put aside my nightly glass (or two) of wine, so it\u2019s down to water and coffee. And it occurred to me - I really don\u2019t *like* the coffee I\u2019ve been making at home. I have delayed fixing that long enough..This machine ticks the boxes for reasonable price point, ease of use, easy to clean, AND such an enjoyable cup. I use almond milk and it foams up so nicely and makes a great taste and such a pleasant sip. I\u2019m usually pretty standard but now I\u2019ve been playing with vanilla, cinnamon, and dark chocolate melting wafers, etc. I even started buying decaf for evening\u2026a first for me.It\u2019s only been a few days, but I am so happy with this machine. Highly Recommend!",

I no longer use powdered coffee creamer as with the warm frothy milk it\u2019s no longer needed. It\u2019s like having coffee house coffee every morning. It\u2019s nice and fast. You can program your favorite way to brew in it and that way when you start the milk frothing, and then select \u201c my favorite\u201d it will automatically brew the coffee as soon as the milk has frothed. I use both pods and freshly ground coffee grounds. It is easily adapted to either. I am SO GLAD I got this and I used to swear by my percolator. The pod brewers have come a long way thru the years. Thank God this one did not have that plastic taste - you can read my other review on that other product. I returned that one and left a bad review. But this one is a keeper for sure !! I just hope it lasts since it was so expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas as his carafe broke for his regular coffee maker. I was kind of glad it broke because brewing a whole pot for one person is a pain. Cleaning the pot, disposing the grounds. We love cappuccinos and lattes and I had no idea that Keurig made this! Found it on amazon and read lots of reviews first. We are soooo happy with this purchase! It brews a concentrated shot from the k cup. Then heats and foams the milk in the cup on the side. It's better than any fancy coffee house. I use milk but my boyfriend uses half and half. It's even creamier. The cup is so easy to clean. He loves it so much that he bought decaf k cups so he can have lattes in the evening. This machine was worth every cent. No more grinding coffee beans and cleaning a carafe pot. Just instant deliciousness!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this because my husband had to have a latte/capp machine. After some research we settled on this one, against my better judgment because of the size. This is a hefty machine! We've never had a Keurig before so this was a new experience. 1) The machine arrived on time but I felt the packaging should have included more \"padding\" to protect it in shipment. My machine arrived in perfect condition but for the money I expected more attention to safeguarding it in shipment should have occurred. There was just this molded cardboard around it in the box.2) After washing everything the machine sets up very quickly. Just fill the removable water tank, pop in a pod, put your cup on the stand and push a button. The thing is once you plug in the machine it goes through a minute or so of humming, which is it getting ready. When that sound is over, lower the handle, choose if your having coffee, latte, or cap, choose the size of the cup, then hit the big \"K\" button. After about 30 secs it starts to brew. It makes a very good cup of coffee. 3) The frother needs some improvement, I believe. First you cannot froth and brew at the same time, its either one or the other. I've tried hitting both the brew button and froth button at the same time, or one after the other with no luck. When I hit the brew button then the froth, the froth button flashes. When the brew ends the froth automatically starts. So either you have to froth first then brew or visa versa. This kind of didn't make sense to me, I don't want my coffee getting cold while I'm waiting for the frother. Or my froth getting cold while I'm waiting for coffee. Also, I do not get the amount of or thickness of froth they show on their video or commercials - no where near. The best I've gotten is using half/half and even that barely makes enough. So overall its a good machine, so far, and I would recommend it with the warning about the frother.UPDATE: Well, we've had this machine for a while now and we're getting a handle on it. Believe it or not, if you want to get a good thick froth use fat free milk. I tried whole milk, heavy cream, half and half with wimpy results. I gave fat free milk a try and couldn't believe the amount and thickness of the froth, It actually looks like the commercial. Also, the instructions aren't really clear about how to use the re-usable pods. You have to push up from underneath the plastic holder for the pod. This might take a little effort, it actually has to pop out. With this out you can now insert the reusable pod.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first coffee machine I've owned that has actually stopped me from buying coffee every morning. I love that it has many size options, including espresso (latte/cappuccino). The milk warmer/frother is amazing and makes it so easy to create a delicious coffee every morning. The only negative I have is that you can't fit much more than a large mug under the brewer. So when I'm making my coffee to go I have to put it in a regular mug first than poor it into my tumbler. The water can take a minute to heat, so I do recommend giving time for that. The great thing is you can hit brew and walk away and when it's ready (heated) it will start brewing for you. I also can press the milk frother start and walk away and it will complete when it can. I did notice that it can't brew coffee and heat the milk at the exact same time.",
