                "reviewText": "I've been using a filter cup and filters, really easy to clean up and use, not very convenient to pour hot water into the filter cup every few minutes. Which is why I got this coffee maker.This product arrived on time and in great shape.Item is light and well made (so far no problems). The plastic feels cheap but it works and is cheap so.....Nice removable plastic basket, I use a basket filter that I used for the filter cup, there's a swivel spout that you move out of the way to remove the filter basket, if you forget to push the spout back over the filter basket then when you close the lid it's made in a way to push the spout over the coffee grounds. The carafe is glass and plastic. The hot plate works well. All in all it's even faster than my filter cup and nice and hot just not burning hot so if you want burning hot look elsewhere.It does take about 50% more coffee grounds to make the same amount I would use with the filter cup. I typically drink one large mug which is equivalent to this carafe, I've cut down my coffee to 1/2 - 3/4 of this carafe to make up the difference in the coffee usage.For the price the convenience is worth it and now I don't have to stand over my coffee filing up the filter cup every few minutes. Love it.",

However, I received it dusty, dirty with some dried-up dirt around the hot plate, scratched up, it looked like it was somebody's return but before re sold it was not cleaned or prepared to be re sold. I thought I purchased a new item not used or returned ,but got one of the later.",

No bells and whistles, just a simple on/off switch.The coffee comes out hot (measured at 175\u00b0 F), and it brews a full pot in about seven minutes. The grab a cup feature works well as does the drip free carafe spout. (Note: If you want coffee hotter than 175, you're looking at a machine that will cost $100 or better. This machine will be fine for most people.)Build quality seems good for the price. After 18 months of use, brewing a pot each day, I cannot complain. The coffee comes out good and hot. I would purchase this machine again.",

It makes good coffee and fairly quickly. The warming plate stays hot until you turn it off.The cord is about 22\u201d long. It can also be tucked into the back of the machine. The reservoir has no volume markings but if you fill it from the carafe this doesn\u2019t matter. Just about perfect.",
