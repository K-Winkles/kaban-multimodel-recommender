It makes 6 brew sizes, from small cup to a full carafe, has a very sturdy fold down pedestal for making the cup sizes, fits a large travel mug, has a built in frother, and even has storage for the included double scoop. I like my coffee strong and, on the Rich setting, this makes the best cup I've ever had from a drip machine. The water reservoir is detachable and the top comes off easily for easy cleaning, you'll need a bottle brush to clean the carafe but that's pretty normal. I haven't tried the cold brew yet but am looking forward to that this summer. It is very feature packed for this price range and makes great coffee!",

                "reviewText": "I'm a terrible Amazon user because I order 90-110 items per month and this is probably my 3rd review. That's how much I LOVE this coffee maker. My coffee is everything, and I like it strong and bold, which is why pods just don't work for me. One of the things I like most is that is has so many size settings from one cup to a carafe including two travel mug sizes. And something I have not seen any other coffee maker is that, because the brew space is tall enough for a carafe, it allows you to also brew directly into the tall travel mug \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc so no dirty carafe to wash every morning. And the single cup platform is very sturdy, can handle large mugs, pulls down from the inside wall and flips right back up out of the way. There is an espresso setting that uses just the right amount of water which you can drink as espresso or as the base for other coffee drinks including lattes. And this is a critical feature that more coffee makers are starting to have: When you press start, it dispenses enough steaming water to properly wet the grounds, waits about 10 seconds, then brews. It makes any coffee taste better, but is especially important for those of use who like it strong. Every feature on this thing works EXACTLY as you hope it would. So many products describe a lot of features, but honestly they\u2019re often crappy and poorly designed so they don't work well, or they require keeping extra attachments somewhere. It's like Ninja thought of every typical frustrating thing about coffee makers and fixed them! The positioning of the frothing arm is perfect - when not in use you don't even notice it; can't even see if you're right in front of the machine. But just reach back and it right there in the perfect spot to froth your milk. The pieces are simple and detach easily for cleaning. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, something as simple as a recessed holder for a two sided (1 & 2 tsp) coffee scoop!! It's right at your fingertips, you snap it back in when you're done and you don't notice it because it's recessed. BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! :)",

                "reviewText": "After reading SO many reviews and researching products, I\u2019m so happy with this guy! My issue was finding a coffee maker that had a time delay brew setting, drip setting AND espresso option. With the \u201cspecialty\u201d and \u201crich\u201d setting, this machine has me covered.I can brew espresso for lattes, single cups for quick days, and full carafes for when I have company. Also, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d notice a difference but the FLAVOR of the brew is so much better than my old machine!!The size is compact and the parts are so easy to clean. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking to elevate your coffee game at a reasonable price!",

                "reviewText": "To start, it is very well packaged yet very easy to remove from the box. This is a biggie for me. No styrofoam packed into a box the seems to be a bit small for the product. This has heavy duty cardboard on top, the lifts easily to give access to the coffeemaker.The coffee maker is very easy to use, set the delay feature or brew immediately. The frother is amazing.Easy to measure how much you want to make with the measuring spoon included, with the amount of spoons to use. The resevoir is marked clearly with the amount of water to use for the amount of coffee your making..The only not so great issue is the opening to the pot is a tad small for washing. You can't put your hand into it to scrub so a brush is necessary.This is the best coffee maker I have ever had. I highly recommend this.",
