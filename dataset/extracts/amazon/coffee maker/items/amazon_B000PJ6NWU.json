Scurried down to my local Costco, where I purchased the original Cuisinart coffee maker, only to find that Costco has discontinued (at least for now) the unit. Plan B, find a replacement carafe on Amazon. Found an Amazon listing, but was concerned that that, although the number of maximum cups was the same, that the unit wouldn't fit. But, any port in a storm, so I ordered the Amazon replacement. Pot arrived the NEXT day! Exact fit, and I'm drinking a nice cup of home brewed coffee! Life's good! So's the coffee!",
