                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Replaced an old Cuisinart coffee maker with the Wolf. The Wolf produces far better coffee than the Cuisinart.Pro:- great coffee, cleaner taste, more aromatic- no steam output from the top making it safe under cabinets- easy access to the water tank and the coffee filter- simple controls- heavy duty - almost 10 pounds- coffee stays hot if you preheat the stainless carafe with hot water- 5 year warranty- FAST brew time - 6-7 minutes- Quiet brewCon:- price - I paid about $420 for the Wolf on sale with points. That is still a bargain compared to high end espresso makers that can top $5k. Thankfully, I\u2019m not an espresso guy.I like this machine. It works well, fits my kitchen counter perfectly, no top steam release that can delaminate of discolor upper cabinets, very quiet (see video), is simple to use and clean and brews quickly, like 7 minutes. Hope that helps!",

                "reviewText": "I have been eyeing this coffee maker for more than a year. I did research, I compared features, I was tempted to buy something cheaper\u2026.. and then one day, while I was at the airport waiting for a flight, I saw this go on Cyber Monday sale\u2026.. and I bought it. Now I have it and I love it!!!!!I finally put it where it belongs. Close to the sink and right under the cabinet with the cups. Fridge with milk is on the other side\u2026. I used to wait for my husband to get up and make coffee. I hated our old set-up where I needed to bring a pitcher of water clear across the kitchen. That was the only place with no upper cabinets. Now I have my Wolf coffee maker close to everything and it is amazing. I can\u2019t wait to make coffee in the morning.The accu brew function is amazing. No more counting scoops. A pre-kindergarten person can do it. It brews super fast and the coffee tastes delicious too. (I have tried various coffee grounds, all turned out awesome.).Whoever designed this coffee maker is brilliant. It is practical, easy to operate, and it FITS under a cabinet. No steam dripping down, no pulling out the whole thing to fill it with water and coffee grounds. Love love love!!It is expensive, so it took me a loooong time to pull the plug and buy it. I don\u2019t regret it. I further love that this machine does one thing and that really really well. I have had coffee makers that do different coffees and have all the bells and whistles. But the result was always the same a bulky machine making an ok cup of coffee requiring a lot of work. This one does one thing. It brews an awesome cup of coffeein a short time while standing under my counter and making me happy. That\u2019s perfect for me.",

                "reviewText": "I just came back to this amazing Wolf coffee machine to buy a THIRD one in four months and thought I\u2019d write a review. I\u2019m not a coffee drinker but my husband is and loves really good, higher end, dark roast coffee and grinds his own beans and has tried about every brand of coffee machines out there with some being around a thousand dollars. For his birthday I bought him this Wolf coffee machine after reading great reviews about it on every website I went to. He loves it! He swears it makes the BEST cup of coffee that he has ever brewed. We travel all over the country for his work so we have it in our motorhome. We went to our home in GA at Thanksgiving and he just couldn\u2019t use his Bunn anymore after using the Wolf so we ordered another one to have for our home. Now he wants me to send one to my sister in Virginia and surprise her with a Wolf since she is also a big coffee drinker like him. At $600 I hope this is the last one he has me order! To have a great cup of coffee every morning like this makes, it\u2019s worth every penny and it makes me feel very good to know that I got him a birthday gift that he loves this much! Besides brewing the best cup of coffee, it also looks good sitting on the counter with its red knobs that Wolf is known for. It\u2019s perfect in every way! Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "Wolf is a great manufacturer. I bought this to match my current Wolf appliances. I like the weighing option but you can always buy a digital scale and weigh out 15 GMs per serving and save on a less expensive machine. I like toys and it\u2019s convenient feature so the extra money was worth it. I couldn\u2019t figure out why many of the reviews were saying the coffee is cold and I almost didn\u2019t purchase the machine. I take my coffee black so this just has not been an issue at all for me. I can see if you add a large amount of milk it could possibly not be hot enough or if the pot sat for an hour before pouring and adding milk. There is no warmer and the pot is thermal insulated. It does hold temp for 90 minutes so if you don\u2019t drink coffee within that time frame this pot is not for you, especially if you add milk. Taking coffee black the coffee will still be warm after 90 minutes for me but not as hot when it was first made. Not cold but drinkable right away. Wolf needs to put some kind of warmer for those who drink milk. I think it\u2019s a novel idea not to but in the real world most people like coffee very hot 90 minutes latter. For me I drink my coffee within an hour so no issues. The machine is expensive and nothing special about the taste over a $200 machine. It does have a nice feature on brew strength but the weighing option takes care of that. The machine is very easy to use too and easy clean up. It is a Wolf and looks cool and if you have Wolf appliances is there really a choice? I gave it four stars as it should have a warmer and probably cost no more than $400.",

Coffee made in under 4 minutes for 10 cups. Taste is amazing as u can customize with beans and adjust strength. Coffee stays smoking hot for way over 1.5hours (without warming up the pot by hot water). Easy to carry and fill water reservoir. Pot has large opening if I want to wash inside. The pour out of it is great. It\u2019s not slow. It\u2019s a normal pour. I realize not everyone can be made happy but common \ud83d\ude44. I\u2019d highly recommend this coffee maker. Especially knowing that they have great support and a warranty for 5 years! And it looks amazing to boot.",
