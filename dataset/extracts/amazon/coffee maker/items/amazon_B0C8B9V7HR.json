It is simple to use with an on/off switch and no other doodads to fail. It brews great coffee and is solidly built. The only issue I have is the lid on the carafe is not removable for cleaning and I worry it might break when washing it as it seems to be the most fragile part of the unit.",

I ran 5 pots of water through with a filter (cooling in between), I didn't want any \"new\" taste. First pot was great.Just what I like, but I use the stainless universal scoop, and put 7 heaping Maxwell House Original Medium Roast, and there were no grounds that went over.When you fill to the 12 cup line, if you look inside, the overflow hole in the back is higher so you can add a little more water. More COFFEE!Love my new Coffee Maker, great one Black + DeckerThanks from a left handed person, who can fill it from the left side. The only thing I would change is have the numbers on both sides of the glass pot, because in your left hand you can't see them.",

It\u2019s a good size for one person and it\u2019s actually pretty quick at brewing.The downsides are it is small if you need more than 5 cups and it doesn\u2019t have a feature that stops brewing if you take the carafe off.Overall, however, it\u2019s a great coffeemaker for the price and for the needs of one person.",

                "reviewText": "Most coffee pots have the feature that supposedly let's you take a cup while the machine is still brewing, but they always spill some coffee when you do that. At least that's been my experience. And that shut off nozzle hanging down catches the pot when you replace it on the hotplate spilling some more coffee.This pot doesn't have that feature so there is nothing hanging down to for the pot to catch on when replacing it. I think that \"sneak a cup\" feature is stupid to begin with. I turn the pot on as soon as I go into the kitchen in the morning and by the time I feed the cats the coffee is ready. It's only a 5 cup pot so it doesn't take long to brew. The size is perfect for me as I'm the only one drinking from it.I also like that the coffee stays steaming hot on the plate even after an hour or more. I like my coffee very hot and my old pot didn't keep the coffee hot enough. I always had to microwave it to get it hot enough. Not so with this pot.",
