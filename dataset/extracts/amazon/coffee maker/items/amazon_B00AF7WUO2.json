                "reviewText": "I want to begin by saying that I absolutely love this thing. I was on the lookout for a coffee maker that would reduce the amount of spillage that my wife does when she pours her coffee. This turned out to be a great solution.We are on our second version of this product. We had a red one at first got it a few years ago. We now have a black one. Here's where the honesty comes in.The quality of a black one is less than the red one for sure. If the red one was a 9 out of 10 Star product when it comes to quality then the black one is probably a seven and a half. The pieces don't have quite the super snug fit that the red one had and the plastic just seems a little bit less refined if that makes sense.The ability to keep your coffee warm the variations of Brew types the Simplicity of use the pour feature are all fantastic. I've seen several on here stating that it leaks. Sure when you overfill it it leaks. If you pour in the water too fast it's going to leak or dribble. After extended use if you don't keep it clean yes it will drip.The only reason we bought a new one is because the last one started to drip. The compartment that holds the coffee which is the top part that you see in my picture that has the clock and the silver area on it started to drip. So you take that off you undo these two screws you remove the little flap that I see people posting on here that broke you give it a good cleaning your rinse out the area on the inside where the flap sits and you put it back together with the two screws and you're good to go.Most people don't take time to maintain their coffee pot when it starts to act up they just buy a new one because they're cheap. On the other hand I am cheap so I try and maintain it clean it take care of it and it lasts. I think we had our other one for 3 years and it started to leak and as I was cleaning it I over tightened the screw and I broke the section that it screws into and that's the only reason I got a new one and can write this review about the quality of the new version.Yes it's probably made in China or Taiwan or something like that but so is everything else. It is a quality product. And it reduces the potential danger of your older mother or your wife spilling hot coffee everywhere. Maybe your dad is not as graceful with the coffee pour. Maybe your kids drink coffee? They just walk up to it put their cup underneath it and push the button and it pours into their cup.Would I recommend this product? 1,000%. Is a little bit of a different process absolutely and that's okay. I think it's cool that the company at Hamilton Beach took the time to create a coffee pot that was completely different than all the other coffee pots you've ever seen. If you're worried about the durability then go get a 1960s percolator that makes 32 cups of coffee and just use that we have one of those that we use for parties and it's been around and works just fine for about 50 years now. But if you're just looking for something that is a little bit different convenient and provides the ability to adjust the Brew type of your coffee from regular to bowl to extra bold then go for this give it a shot. I like companies that think outside the box and Hamilton Beach has done a great job of that with this product. Like I said I bought two of them and if I had friends that I wanted to spend 50 bucks on for Christmas I probably buy one of these for them too.So don't let the negative reviews deter you because sometimes people get lemons it's the same debate between Ford versus Chevy this is Hamilton Beach versus Mr Coffee sometimes people have great results with one and not the other but for the most part it's a coffee pot man it should work just fine.I will end this by saying that I am a fan a very big fan. And would totally 100% recommend this product if someone asked me about it. Oh look they asked me about it, and here I am recommending it.",

                "reviewText": "I thought I'd love this, then got it and thought I hated it, but now I love it again.When I got it I thought the space to pour water in was awkward and a little small... Till I bought a Mr coffee and that was even worse... Now I think it's not that bad. It's a little different pouring from the little bucket thing, but now that I'm used to it, it doesn't spill much, especially if I don't pour too fast.Another thing I thought was a little strange is that this coffee maker claims not to give you the burnt coffee taste because it keeps warm inside the machine. The thing is, there still is a heating element inside the bucket that holds the coffee and keeps it warm... In other words there's direct contact between your coffee and the heating element. With your typical glass decanter you at least have the layer of glass between the heating element and the coffee. That said, I'm not particularly picky so I may not be the best judge, but I don't notice any burnt coffee (or tea) taste even if I reheat it later and it's been heating in that thing for maybe eight hours even. I end up needing to clean the element with a little steel wool if I want to get it shining again. Scrubbing with a sponge still leaves brown marks on that metal, but I suppose any coffee pot needs a deep clean sometimes.The thing I really don't like is that you have to take the basket out and set it down somewhere on your counter while you're getting the bucket out to fill and pour. I don't really like the wet basket (if I just rinsed it) sitting on the counter or it possibly getting bacteria from something, I'd rather be able to just leave it sitting in the coffee machine when I'm not cleaning it. It isn't difficult to get in and out though. The basket and bucket set easily into the machine and there's no dripping after you release pressure on the dispenser button. It all functions nicely and easily.Overall, I really love the ability to reheat easily and dispense one cup at a time. I don't know why really because you can do that with any coffee maker but it's just kind of nice and maybe a little fun. Despite the things that annoy me I think that they are probably necessary for this design and not really a flaw, you just have to decide if it works for you. After buying the Mr Coffee when I expected to return this, I developed a new perspective and I decided this works for me very well overall. I've decided to keep this one for brewing tea and my son is in love with the Mr Coffee so that sticking around for coffee. I'm comfortable giving it 5 stars. If it gives out on me or I have other problems with it I will update the review.**UPDATE: it is now two years since I bought this machine. I took a break from my tea obsession for the last 6-9 months, so it hasn't truly had two years of use, but it has always worked as expected without any issues other than the minor irritations I mentioned above. I recently started using it again, for coffee this time, and I still love it just as much as before, maybe more since it's been quite reliable.",

                "reviewText": "First, I would suggest buying some cheap coffee and brew 2 or 3 containers and throwing these away as I found the first couple of batches had a funky plastic taste. By the fourth day the flavor was better and has continued to improve with each use.Secondly, I would recommend the manufacturer make a protector of some sort so that when you are filling the water reservoir the heating element does not get wet. You have to be careful about pouring the water into the reservoir or you'll get this wet and it will boil between the heating element and the heating plate where the coffee is stored. This is one of the reasons for a 4 star rating.Finally, it would be nice to have a small LED light where the coffee comes out to light the inside of your cup. It is so dark, and you cannot see what level of fullness your cup is. My wife does not like this machine for that reason. Loves the coffee but does not like not being able to see when getting coffee.The bold feature is wonderful as we prefer strong, dark coffee. I actually re-roast my beans to achieve the level of darkness I want in my coffee. The bold feature further enhances my experience!Overall, this is a great coffee maker. Probably the best I have ever owned outside of true Spanish style or French press, expresso makers.Additionally, I wish I could turn the heating element back on without having to go through the brewing process. I usually have the heating element for 2 hours and sometimes I would like to turn it back on however it runs through the brewing cycle first and then the heater is left on for another 2 hours.",

Coffee is delicious and hot every time. I cannot find anything negative about this machine so 5* all the way.",
