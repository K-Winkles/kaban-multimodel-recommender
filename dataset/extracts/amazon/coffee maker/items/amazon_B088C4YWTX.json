I don't doubt her word, but my experience differs from hers. I've been using cold water and my coffee is very nicely hot.Have already recommended it to a friend, and I most likely will again.UPDATE: And it just completely died after ten cups. I'll be arranging for an exchange today.ADDITIONAL: Amazon made the exchange for a replacement of the same make, model and color very fast and easy.So far, it's working great. I'll revise this again in a couple weeks.ADDITIONAL: Replacement was fast and easy, and the replacement is working fine.",

This little machine is adorable, the price is rightIt makes delicious, bold coffee, quickly, and easily.. it\u2019s a large travel size cup filled when you fill it to the max. The only downside is that larger coffee mugs might not sit well on the plate. I use a smaller stainless steel milk frothing pitcher while brewing",

                "reviewText": "The coffee maker is super cute and does make coffee just fine. However, my unit arrived with a defective/broken basket handle. A small detail, it\u2019s true, but never used items shouldn\u2019t arrive broken.FUNCTION: it makes a hot cup of coffee with little bean waste. If you like rich, dense coffee, don\u2019t expect it from this machine though. I advise buying coffee a little darker roast than you normally would to compensate. If you prefer freshly ground coffee, a finer grind would help.STYLE: super cute! I even got a matching tea kettle. Both look great in my kitchen. I had a single serve coffee maker from another vendor and this one is lighter and more compact, making it ideal for small spaces or for portability.DURABILITY: meh. As stated, the coffee maker arrived with a defective basket handle. Half of the plastic pin that should hold it in place was missing. There was no sign of a break. It just wasn\u2019t made correctly. The other internal pieces are made of thin, flimsy plastic. Although I\u2019m sure this adds to the light weight of the machine, it also means it will be easy to accidentally break a part when not exercising delicate handling.All In all it\u2019s an ok product for the price. It\u2019s not the quality you\u2019d expect from the brand though.",

And, I had to use a smaller mug/coffee cup to fit where the coffee drains. What a great cup of coffee. Brew time is fast. coffee is piping hot and there really isn't much clean up needed other than the filter. AWESOME little appliance.",
