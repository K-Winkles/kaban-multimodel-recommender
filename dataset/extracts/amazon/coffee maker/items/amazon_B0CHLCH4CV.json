Not only is this the least expensive method I've tried, but it is also the best. My first cup of coffee the ext morning was terrific. Highly recommended.",

The descale indicator had not yet turned on but the amount of water dispensed was beginning to vary, indicating that I needed to descale the machine. (We get a lot of white crusty residue from our water.) I mixed the powder as directed and poured it into the reservoir. My reservoir is large so it took all the solution. I first brewed a carafe of 12 cups to clean the carafe side of the machine. Once that was done I poured the liquid back into the reservoir so that I could brew on the K-cup side. I ran the K-cup side for one 12 ounce session then left the machine sit for several hours. When I returned I ran the rest of the descaler through the K-cup side. Once I finished with the descaler liquid I filled the reservoir again and ran a 12 cup carafe then I filled the reservoir and ran four 12 oz. cups on the K-cup side.The directions say to fill the reservoir once and flush the machine, but I did it twice just to be sure. Coffee the next morning was fine, no funny taste due to the descaler.",

                "reviewText": "I guess I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this Milliard Descaler Powder, 1 lb. It's made of citric acid.A while back I bought a larger bag (maybe 3lbs?) of Milliard food grade citric acid to clean my tannin filter and iron filter in my vacation home. It did a great job and saved me a lot of money. I can attest to the purity and effectiveness of this product to remove scale, mineral buildup, or whatever unwanted deposits you may have in a unit that processes consumables (such as water, drinks, food, etc) This is safe to use in recommended doses, as citric acid is also used in many food products.I bit of a warning, though. Don't put too high of a concentration in whatever you are cleaning. It will leave a tart taste that won't go away for quite a while, and it could damage your equipment. Fortunately the container has directions on how to descale your coffee maker. Also, if you are using it on a machine that has an inlet water filter cartridge, such as a commercial Keurig, be sure to bypass the filter, as descaler will contaminate the membrane and leave a permanent taste in it. And remember to flush your machine several times to remove any residual aftertaste.If you have any minerals in your drinking water, then you probably have buildup in your coffee maker that will eventually slow down or plug up parts of the machine. This is enough for many, many de-scalings.",
