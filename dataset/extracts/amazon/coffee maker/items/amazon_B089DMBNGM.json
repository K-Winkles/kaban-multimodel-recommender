                "reviewText": "Love this coffee pot. I don't buy the most expensive coffee or grind my own beans and the coffee still has the best flavor of any coffee pot I have had for years. The 4 hour warming plate plus the adjustable temperature of the plate is fantastic. I use 4 hours on medium and it never burns my coffee. I can't use the permanent filter, allergic to metal, but the paper work very well with this pot. The only problem I had was getting the amount of grounds correctly for the pot. Even the really strong coffee I made was good tasting and not bitter. LOVE THIS POT. Can't say enough about it. It is very good looking, just the right size and the pot is easy to handle. Broke my wrist and it gets picky with balance and has no problem lifting and pouring the pot. No drips when you pour. It does have a feature that I have never seen before. A rubber 'gasket' that goes above the pot to put the condensation back into the pot. That helps keep the coffee at the right mixture and was a very clever idea. I did learn that if you put the pot in the holder and turn the handle to the side it seats the gasket seats correctly every time.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this pot for almost 2 years. I love my Joe and have owned several pots. None compare. Excellent hot coffee with adjustment for strength, hot plate temp. And time. I\u2019ve tossed my Brauns (had 4), cuisinart, Krups and Hamilton beach. When it dies I will get another. Heck I might just buy an extra one now.UpdateI bought 4 of these Calphalons. 2 burned out within a short time (months). I put the third into service. It leaked water from the bottom immediately. Makes great coffee but service life is very poor. Do not buy.I have a 30 year old Braun backup that I put back in service. Great pot, but only available on eBay. I ordered a cuisinart rapid brew today with a warranty.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this coffee maker on Jan. 10th 2024. Received a few days later and was looking forward to a new coffee maker since our old one started to leak. It was a Cuisinart 14 cup programable coffee maker. Used the new Calphalon coffee maker for about a week. While making a pot of coffee, there was this loud cracking noise. I checked the coffee maker and sure enough the warming plate ring had cracked. Seems to be a manufacturing defect since others have reported the same thing. Amazon replaced it and it should arrive today. Hope I have better luck with this one. Another problem I have is, that the carafe will not come clean. It has a brown film, from the coffee, that no matter how many times I wash it that haze is still there. Also, the carafe is very had to hand wash due to the pouring spot.Received the replacement coffee maker on Jan. 29th, 2024. Today is Feb. 11, 2024 and this morning while brewing a pot of coffee i once more heard a low crack and sure enough this coffee maker also cracked in the same place as the first one(the back rim of the warming plate. Not sure what I will do now. At least the carafe is able to come clean, unlike the 1st one.",

                "reviewText": "When I bought this machine I was pleased with the quality and how well it brewed coffee, but after several weeks, the coffee brewing deteriorated, which I attributed to the charcoal filter. I found that there are no compatible filters on the market. The manual indicates that filters are available at calohalon.com, but they are not. After 30 minutes on the line with Calphalon\u2019s service number, I was repeated put on hold while the representative attempted to provide me a source for the filters. The representative confirmed that the filters were not available at Calphalon.com and ultimately told me that the could be ordered from replacement parts.com for $15 each, but we\u2019re on back order. She gave me a part number which does not appear on the site, I can neither confirm nor deny the availability. Even if they were available, that is an outrageous amount to spend on a filter that needs changing every 30 to 60 daysOverall I am extremely frustrated and would like to be rid of this machine.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Calphalon coffee maker to replace my old Calphalon I purchased almost 10 years ago. The old one still works like a charm. Still makes the best coffee ever! The only thing wrong with the old one is that the heating element stopped heating.I was so happy that I could still get this new Calaphon coffee maker. It was a great buy! It also works like a charm just like the as good as the one I purchased years ago. and so does the heating element as the older coffee had done in the past.Other reviews mention noise. I have great hearing and only thing I hear is a coffee maker that\u2019s serious about making great coffee. I love how it sounds when it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job. It\u2019s a good sound. But, then, I grew up in the age of the old-fashioned percolator. That was a good sound, too, in my opinion.",
