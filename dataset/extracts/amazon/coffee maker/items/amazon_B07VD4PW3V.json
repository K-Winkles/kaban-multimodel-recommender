                "reviewText": "There has been bad reviews on this but maybe with the newer ones they corrected the problems of past. Mine works fine! Some reviews said the (finished brewing) beep was loud, mine is soft. Some said the flip lid is hard to take off to wash, mine I put a drop of vegetable oil on the tip of my finger and put it on the hinge and it comes off ok all the time now without putting a drop of oil on it. Some complained on the 4 hour shutoff. I usually drink my coffee by then and just turn it off. I like how you can take half of it apart and put it in the dishwasher, the other half you can\u2019t because it\u2019s the electrical part. So far I\u2019m very pleased!! Mostly I like the water filter on it, it\u2019s a little smaller then the Keurig filters.",

                "reviewText": "The previous one worked quite well for some time, but my brew now button started giving me fits on the weekends when I didn't use auto-brew... It would be difficult to activate and finally stopped working at all... the Auto-Brew functioned though... So I got a new one, it cost more this time, but it wasn't surprising...Now it started doing the same thing after a much shorter time... I think the defect is in the button itself...since it was identical in nature a bad batch of parts makes sense to me... Having been so long between purchases makes me wonder how many of these are doing to same thing to other people...",

There are no tricks to learn, the entire top tips up to easily pour a full pot of water in, and filling the filter with coffee is a breeze.I have owned coffeemakers where pouting the water in meant getting a mop, and have had some strangely engineered filter holders - a thing of the past. The clock is easy to adjust.Amazing!",

                "reviewText": "--UPDATE-- After having the coffee pot for only 2 months... And without even using it on a daily basis... The unit stopped being able to pump water from the tank into the coffree brew basket. In addition to the notes below, the machine is now completely worthless and broken. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS.*******************I saw a customer review, before making the purchase... Warning that the spring-loaded stopper on the bottom of the filter basket was extraordinarily flimsy. They said - it broke off the first time they cleaned the unit. KNOWING THIS ISSUE - I was as cautious as any human person could ever be when attempting to clean the filter basket. Guess what? The cheap materials broke anyway. DO NOT BUY. I have only had the unit for 3 weeks and it's already busted.Due to this flaw - Now I cannot let the grounds steep (at least until the brew basket is starting to become full of hot water) before putting the pot underneath, nor can I remove the pot while the unit is still brewing.Note: I bought a Mr. Coffee 2-in-1 that had K-cup and thermos carafe, so that guests could use K-cups if they want. It leaked the whole water tank on the counter on a regular basis. It stopped making hot coffee after a few months (even the first cup, freshly brewed, had to be microwaved before drinking). The size selection did not work - in order to brew a full pot I had to run the unit twice over (from day one). I struggled with it so long, that I SWORE that I would not buy Mr. Coffee when shopping for the replacement. But I fell for another gimmick.Mr. Coffee brand, which used to be affordable yet quality products, is now just gimmicks. They sell you on a 2-in-1 and the engineering/materials/design are horrible. They sell you on the \"easy to disassemble and clean\" gimmick, but the materials are so cheap that handling them for cleaning will always result in damage to the unit.I will never buy anything from Mr. Coffee again after he last two coffeemakers were total trash. Thanks for nothing!",

                "reviewText": "Mr. Coffee 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker with Dish-washable Design is fantastic. It's unique in that the entire top portion of the coffee maker comes apart very easily for cleaning, even the internal sprayer separates for easy cleaning. I love the carbon filter, makes the coffee much less bitter and it's a feature that is not easy to find in an affordable coffee maker (once you own a coffee maker that has an internal filter you will not settle for one that does not have this feature - makes a huge difference in the taste of the coffee. Basic coffee makers pale in comparison.) The coffee maker is simple to set up and program. The coffee maker stays hot for two hours and then turns off automatically so you don't have to worry about forgetting to turn off the coffee maker - it does it for you! The coffee maker brews 12 / 5 oz cups of coffee in under 10 minutes and then beeps quickly when it's done. There seems to be a slight low buzz noise coming from the clock at the base of the unit but I don't think it's a problem (I noticed the noise when I plugged the unit in - has nothing to do with the brewing process). I'm very satisfied with the coffee maker. It has all the features that I was looking for in a coffee pot at a very affordable price. Makes a delicious cup of coffee!",

Brews very hot coffee, timer set up so I can wake up to ready made coffee, easy to clean with dishwasher placement option, minimal buttons, very neat feature that brings the water arm bar to correct spot if you forget and lastly brews full body coffee flavor! I love this machine.",
