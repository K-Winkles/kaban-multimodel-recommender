                "reviewText": "We chose this brand because it offers a stainless steel carafe that truly keeps coffee warm for hours. This model is different from our previous; this offers the option for single serve pods, which is a nice feature. What I dislike: it is Very Hard to pour without making a mess! Water goes everywhere because of the shape of the lid on the carafe, and there's a tall plastic piece that holds a water filter, which splashes the water everywhere. This lid is just as the original one we had; which was also annoying. It is Very difficult when you go to pour that last cup of coffee also- it spills out the top holes; you actually have to hold the pot nearly upside-down to get the last cup of coffee out! The hinged lid on the coffee maker itself doesn't hinge back far enough to give you enough room to pour water into the machine. I also don't care for the fact that the blue light stays on All the time, \"indicating low water level\" on the single serve side. I don't want to keep water in there just to get stagnant! I feel it should have it's own On/Off switch. We also purchased it because of the price- we didn't want to spend over $200 to get a different brand. But I think we should have!",

And if you do, don\u2019t purchase through Amazon because Cuisinart will not refund when it doesn\u2019t work properly.The Keurig part hasn\u2019t worked properly since purchase. The top metal thing supposed to punch open the K-Cup is not sharp and rips open a bigger hole causing the water to overflow the grounds and turns it into a mess letting grounds go into your cup of coffee. I can\u2019t tell you how many k-cups wasted in the last 6 months.Company policy states to cut the cord and send an email of the pic BEFORE they release the replacement unit. This takes up to 2 weeks to receive\u2026without in home coffee?! NOT gonna happen!KATHRYN from customer service WAS AMAZING and was able to release my replacement unit prior to cutting the cord (carafe works great).UPDATE: new replacement unit does the same thing!!! UGH! Called CS again and now they\u2019re sending me a \u201ccap\u201d. Not sure what that\u2019s going to do or if it will work but willing to try anything since they won\u2019t refund me my $172 (this item is now $189). I\u2019ll let you know if this cap works.2nd Update: Cuisinart sent the same part already included in the Keurig brewing process. Also the new Keurig water tank leaks! I\u2019m so done with this POS!I stand by my original recommendation: DONT BUY!",

                "reviewText": "There are very few choices if you want to be able to use K-cups and still be able to brew a full pot of coffee when you have company. Cuisinart does this quite well. The coffee tastes great when the unit is brand new, less so after a while...Only gripe I have is that cleaning the K-cup side requires you to simultaneously press the 6 oz and 8 oz buttons for 2 seconds - this is harder than it seems! Wish there was a separate button for the cleaning function.",

(Gifts too) Negatives - They only last me about 18 months. Now I am a heavy coffee drinker but I think they should last longer. The first one purchased and this one did leak from water tanks. I have a love/hate relationship with this coffee maker. That being said, I still find it better than any other combo set.",

                "reviewText": "We love this! But we thought that both sides shared a water tank that you could remove and fill. Not the case. The coffee pot side works just like any other coffee pot brewer and having the single serve on the side makes it a bit more difficult to use the pot brewer. Sometimes the pot isn't lined up exactly right, so the filter doesn't pour down and overflows, getting grains in the coffee. The coffee pot stays hot for HOURS.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE the fact that it's a Cuisinart. I have had complete satisfaction in the past and assurance f quality products, however I FAILED to read the reviews on THIS one, I wsh I had. I had a power surge and my LAST coffeee maker of the same brand and type blew out!! It was relatively new and I was anxious to replace. I am sorry I didn't spend more time. The ONLY problem I have with THIS new maker is the \"thermal\" coffee pot. It does NOT show how MUCH coffee anywhere ON the pot, so while you are TRYING to read the measure on the LEFT side, while TRYING to pour into TOP, a LOT spills! The SPOUT is too long and shoots the water out the end, PAST the hole you are trying to FILL! It does NOT keep the coffee hot, as I assumed it would and you cannot get your hand INSIDE to WASH the pot after use!! BIG mistakes in design which would be easy to correct. It has great features, asthetics of design, the size and the pour a cup while brewng feature and of course, the Cuisinart name, but I am very disappointed in this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The thermal carafe prevents the burned flavour that happens when a pot is left on the heating pad too long. And the combination single and 10 cup unit saves counter space.This is a very good coffee maker with only a couple of draw backs. It is awkward to fill the coffee carafe water reservoir because the lid does not open wide enough to accommodate the width of the thermal coffee carafe. I have to use a jug with a long spout to fill it easily. The single cup side works well.I was also very frustrated with the product registration process with Cuisinart. I was unable to access the registration site online in spite of some \"help\" from their customer service agent. There was no follow up from them when I continued to have trouble even after trying their suggestions. Outcome: product still not registered!",

It makes a splattery mess with the single serve brew and now it is broken, after only 3 months of use. You have to push the single serve button 18 times to get one 10 oz cup of coffee... and it overflows a big mug.This product (purchased in Canada through amazon.ca, and through the Cuisinart Canada amazon page) is NOT supported by warranty, as they don't have an equivalent replacement. The replacement they want to send me is a glass carafe worth $100 less than the stainless steel carafe model. So now I'm losing $100 on a sub-par replacement. This is completely unacceptable service by Cuisinart. DO NOT waste your time buying this, there is no warranty support for it.",
