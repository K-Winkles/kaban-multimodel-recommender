We had a Keurig, which provided our family with ease of making only 1 cup at a time, on demand, but figured out we were spending so much money on Kcups. With inflation and the cost of groceries, we needed to make some adjustments to our budget. We found this coffee maker on sale on Amazon and thought this could help us out a lot! The coffee pot arrived on time. The coffee pot is programmable for a denatured brew, has a clock, and you can choose from your regular coffee brew or a strong coffee brew. The carafe is stainless steel. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for an hour after brew, and luke warm throughout an 8 hour day. The directions did state that if you put boiling water into the carafe before brewing, it would stay hot longer, but I like the delayed brew to much to do that.The coffee maker does what it is supposed to do and good quality with a good price tag!",

                "reviewText": "I am a diehard review reader when I am shopping for something, so I thought that I\u2019d share our review of this Black And Decker coffee maker. Firstly, we\u2019ve been using a percolator for years because our last two coffee makers had glass pots with hot plates, and over time the hot plates had gotten all scratched and looked bad even after I tried to clean them. Burned on \u201cstuff\u201d and I don\u2019t know what else drove me crazy. I eventually pulled out the percolator that we\u2019d had for a long time, and honestly, although it worked fine, I wanted a change.Enter my search for a coffee maker with a thermal carafe since no hot plate is needed, and after hours of research I decided to give this one a try. I should add that my husband and I are kind of coffee snobs in that we like our coffee robust, black and on the stronger side. He likes his hot, so I was a bit concerned about this carafe.The first night I pushed the \u201cstrong\u201d button, and after reading reviews, I told my husband to run the empty carafe under hot water prior to brewing to ensure hot coffee. He gets up for work well before me, so there is at least an hour after the coffee is made before I pour my first cup. Day 1 coffee was hot and very good.For day 2 and until today we haven\u2019t used the \u201cstrong\u201d feature, and it honestly hasn\u2019t made a difference. Brewing time is a little less not using it (about 15 minutes), and overall it\u2019s quiet. We have both commented that the coffee tastes better than with the percolator. I should add that I purchased a stainless steel coffee filter for Black and Decker machines here on Amazon.It\u2019s winter as I write this, so for now he will continue to run the carafe under hot water to help keep it hot, but as the weather warms up we are going to try to not do that. The coffee stays hot in the carafe, which was one of my concerns. In fact the first day I poured the remaining coffee into a cup at 2:30pm (he had brewed it before 6:30am), and it was still lukewarm. So hot coffee has not been an issue. We leave the carafe sitting on the countertop after brewing.Overall I am very happy with this purchase. I went back and forth on the two models listed here and ultimately chose the CM2046S. Yes, it would be nice if the clock had back lighting, but it\u2019s not an issue for us. And as far as cleaning\u2026.when it comes time I\u2019ll run vinegar water through it.I definitely recommend this coffee maker!",

                "reviewText": "tl;dr: Can't beat it for the price. Disclaimer: I have only used it one time. But I was so impressed, that I felt like writing a review. I am not a full-blown coffee snob, but I do all the things: fresh beans, ground daily in a burr, filtered water, proper ratio, etc. I also prefer a carafe vs a hotplate for all the reasons you already know if you're looking here.I've had a Melitta for 7+ years & it was time to upgrade. I agonized over the replacement decision since I love coffee so much but wasn't interested in spending $200-300. I would spend that kind of money if I felt it was worth it, but many models (Moccamaster for example) got spotty reviews. So I decided to try the B&D since. I figured its $60 so if it sucks, I can move on. So far, I am very impressed. Why?- Brews hot! I put a thermapen in the first pot & it registered ~195. This is key.- Brews fast!- 3 hours later (!) it is ~160.- I just used the permanent filter basket (included) the first time & got no grit. Delicious taste. It was a bit of a pain to empty after but that can be solved by using a paper filter, so not a knock on the maker.There are 2 very minor reasons I can't give it 5 stars:- It doesn't automatically turn off after a cycle. I guess it doesn't really matter, since nothing is hot or really happening. But it should shut off. My Melitta did.- The top of the carafe is a little goofy to take on and off. Maybe I just need to get used to it but it is more complicated than my Melitta.But all in all, for $60, this is a BUY!",

                "reviewText": "The water reservoir is large and easy to access for a no-spillage filling of the machine. Coffee basket easy to remove and clean. Carafe has an easy to use top that locks easily in place. Compact footprint and attractive designed front. The display for clock and brew status is not backlit and a little on the small side that\u2019s my only complaint.",

                "reviewText": "Our old one was acting up, so we bought an updated version. Keeps coffee pretty hot, but like any thermal carafe, without a burner, it eventually cools down. Still, we usually go through it before it gets the chance. A couple of strength settings, along with a 2-4 cup feature, programmable timer and a cleaning feature, make this a versatile coffeemaker.",
