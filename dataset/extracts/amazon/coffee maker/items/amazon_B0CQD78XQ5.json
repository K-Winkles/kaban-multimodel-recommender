The coffee is super hot w/3 heat settings, the hot runs basically 165 degrees so we run it medium heat. I like the \"all pod\" option and a very large removeable cup reservoir. A little pricy but way better then our original Kuerig & Cusinart we just trashed.",

                "reviewText": "We enjoy the craft side of this coffee machine. We have had major issues with the pod side. Each time we use it, since the first time, it overflows and grounds get all in the cup of coffee and also all in and around the machine. It is a pain to clean the grounds out of the machine because no parts come out to clean, you just have to wipe inside and around until all the grounds are gone, this is very time consuming. Also when I contacted Cuisinart customer service I do not think their return policy is fair. They want me to cut the cord to the machine, take a picture of this, send back the machine and then wait 2 weeks for the replacement, therefore we would be without a coffee pot for two weeks because they sell a faulty product? If I have to go out and get a new coffee pot I\u2019m going to buy a new one and not waste 200$ on one that doesn\u2019t work well. I asked if they could charge me for the new one, ship it and then refund me when they get my broken one back, so we can use the craft side in the mean time, so we don\u2019t have to be without one. They told me no, and I will have to go without and wait for the replacement. Seems strange, I asked why they operate this way and they responded, \u201cwe have alot of fraud and don\u2019t trust customers to return the products\u201d. Well welcome to the world, everyone deals with fraud, unfortunately part of owning a company is making the customer happy and standing behind your product. Very disappointed in this company and the product quality. Do not buy this machine!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this for about a month and I am happy so far. The carafe is big if we need to make a lot of coffee. But having the option of making one cup only is great, that is the side we use most. The built in filters that comes with each side saves me money from not needing to buy filters and I get to use the same coffee for both sides. No need to buy individual pods, which can add up $$. The water reservoir holds enough for multiple cups and is easy to detach so you can fill it. The instructions are easy to read. The display is very nice and modern. It makes hot and cold coffee and we use both options. The one thing I did not account for is the height of the machine. My cabinet on top does not allow me to fully open the lid on the right side. The machine is too tall and I do not have enough space between the top and bottom cabinets. That was my fault though, as I should have measured. I recommend measuring your space before you buy. You will need about a foot of space between the top of the machine and the top cabinet to fully lift the lid up. This is only an issue for the side of the carafe not the single cup that takes pods. That side works fine as it is a smaller lid that does not take up as much space. That is the only inconvenience I have with this machine. But it is not a reason for me to return it. I feel like happy with this purchase and have gotten compliments on it from family members who visit.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was searching for a coffee pot that offered both a K Cup option as well as traditional coffee pot style. I have previously been happy with Cuisinart coffee makers, so when I saw this one I ordered it. I love this coffee pot and would recommend this for anyone looking for a dual purpose coffee pot. This coffee pot offers the option to have your coffee on a timer which I love because I make my coffee the night before and set the auto brew so it's ready when I wake up. The K Cup side offers easy to clean removable pieces as well as a removable water canister to make it easy to add more water. Also to add, my kids love using hot chocolate k cups too. This is an all around great coffee pot. I am overall very happy with my purchase.",

The machine is easy to use, I usually make a half pot in the morning. The warming plate has different settings and I find Medium keeps it just the right temperature. If I want a cup of decaf in the afternoon I use the single cup side. Having options is great!",

                "reviewText": "I hate to leave a bad review about a Cuisinart product. I've purchased many of them, including the pod only machine, and the combo unit that was the previous version of this one.I was super excited that this newer machine had the pod dispenser on the left side (the old one had it on the right side), it works better for my counter set up.The older machine didn't poop out, I just moved it to my office to make room for the new one.Here's the problem: The coffeepot dispenser worked fine, it was the pod dispenser that didn't work very well. I can't tell what the actual problem was, it seemed to work better if I stood there and pushed down on the pop up pod door. Even then it would leak water around the pod into the cup (if it actually dispensed some coffee), sometimes it would dispense only vaguely brown water - and made a crap load of noise doing it.It makes me really annoyed to ditch a machine after so little time, but I will be tossing it - because it takes up too much room to keep it for the coffee pot.",

I even tried calling Cuisinart customer service, but after waiting for 20 minutes, I was hung up on. It's a real shame since the machine looks great, but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend it.",
