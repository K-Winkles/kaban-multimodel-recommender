                "reviewText": "I have a Keurig coffee pot and a house with hard water. Every few months the coffee maker will slow down the water flow, illuminate the descale light and stop working. In the past I ran several cups of vinegar through the machine to clear out the particulates and the hard water residue. The vinegar does a good job, but takes several pitchers of water to flush out. I saw these and thought they would be a better, easier way to clean; and i was right. The package says to fill the water tank with water and drop one of these tablets in and run a couple of cups of water through it. When I put the tablet in the water tank it began fizzing and took about five minutes to completely dissolve. I decided to run 4 cups of water through to really clean the machine. The first cup came out and the water was slightly brown with a lot of particulates in it, the second cup was clearer but still had particulates in it. After the second cup, the water got foamy and it was hard to see if there was anything in the water, I ran more cups though just to be sure it was clean The space for the coffee pods filled with foam and the last cup came out with mostly foam. After that, I dumped the water tank out, rinsed it well and filled it with clean water. After the third cup the foam was gone. I ran almost the whole tank of clean water through the machine just to be safe. I then refilled the tank, ran it thought the machine, let it col off and then drank it. The water tasted fine, with no taste other than water. I am happy with these, using them once a month the box will last an entire year",

I bought a Keurig K-Express Essentials machine a couple months ago, and do use purified water, as I have hard water. But I drink a lot of large coffees, so the descaler light came on soon (and I was happy to find it stayed on, but didn't require me to clean the machine to continue to work.) I believe the Descaler light on my particular machine is set to come after so many brews (vs. actual scale buildup). I googled instructions, (do this) as this was my 1st time, and learned: #1 Take out any coffee pod (duh). #2 You start the procedure w/ all lights off. (You don't open and close the lid first - the instructions didn't specify.) #3 In order to not waste the (heated) water, I threw it on my patio table outside, to clean it some. Following the instructions, my Renuv tablet didn't dissolve in the first tank of water, so I ran a 2nd one through. It did then, and the Descale light went out. I then made myself some coffee, and didn't taste a difference, but didn't expect to, as the cleaning water wasn't that dark whatsoever.",

                "reviewText": "Each in a packet you tear open, all come in a box.This did NOT remove the scale from my electric kettle. I wanted to use it on that first as I can see what it is doing. We have fairly hard water (lots of calcium carbonate) and we get scale build up pretty fast. My go to to descale in products we use for food or drink is citric acid, as it is very safe. It does leave a bit of lemon taste if you do not rise well, but that is preferable to a lot of other tastes. This was far less effective than straight citric acid (or some of you might use vinegar, but the smell to me is worse). It DID excel at cleaning and bleaching out a carafe we use for tea, it tends to get very stained and this tablet worked much better on removing those stains than citric acid. It worked about as well as using half a dishwasher tablet (my usual method) but with less issue of aftertaste.These are way more expensive than using citric acid (bought in bulk) but they are convienent and do get rid of stains. Not that effect on scale. The ingredients in this do puzzle me, why there is a strong base and a weak acid both in there, which would tend to counter each other.What is in it?First ingredient is Sodium Percarbonate, which most of you know as Oxiclean, it is a bleaching agent. Next is Sodium Carbonate, which you know as baking powder which is a strong base. Next up is Citric Acid, which is what makes lemonade mixes tart, it is a weak acid. Next is Trisodium Dicarboxymethyl Alaninate which is a chelator, which is used to bond to metal ions. Next up is TAED or Tetraacetylethylenediamine (which is why they shorten it) which is another bleaching agent like Oxiclean. The rest should be small amounts, some surfactants and such.",

                "reviewText": "We live in Midwest, we can drink and use the tap water, sadly it's a very hard water. We do have whole house filtration system in place, however calcification is a big problem. I also enjoy quality coffee, and a home barista for my family and friends. I own high-end coffee and espresso machines. I decalcify these machines religiously every month. I ordered these descaler and cleaner tablets for my coffee machine from Amazon, arrived very quickly in a very nice packaging. Out of the box I received a 12 tablets, they are XL size to efficiently descale and clean my coffee machine. I highly recommend to follow the instructions and make sure to checkmark the included monthly checkboxes on the packingin to follow your cleaning. I think these tablets works really good with my coffee machine and I highly recommend it.",

I don't rely on the sensors within the machine to tell me it's time to descale. Any brand on the marker will suggest some type of vinegar solution or a proprietary brand for the descaling process. This product makes your cleaning process as effortless as dropping your coffee pod in. There is no measuring or mixing of a solution. Just drop one of the 12 tablets into your machine once a month and feel assured that you keeping your machine as healthy as possible. This product was chosen through the Amazon Vine program free of charge. This fact has absolutely no influence on my opinion.",
