                "reviewText": "Wow, I love this little iced coffee maker! I didn't have high expectations for it but I promise you, it's a awesome machine! I've tried many different coffee makers and none of them made a good iced coffee besides the Ninja coffee bar. However, the Ninja bar malfunctioned constantly and had to keep getting replaced (this shouldn't happen with a almost $200 product) so we eventually threw it away. My husband bought a Keurig coffee maker but to me, the coffee that comes from that tastes like sock water. It's gross and not strong enough for my liking plus it cannot make a good iced coffee.This machine is small so it doesn't take up much counter space at all. It is very easy to use and clean! The cup it comes with is nice and you can measure the amount of water for the machine with it (it has the water line on the cup) so it will make just enough for the cup! Fill it with water, add coffee grounds, add ice and sugar (or fake sugar and syrup if you do that) to your cup, and press start- it's that simple! You can select your desired drip speed, I slide it all the way so that it drips faster, however, it is still kind of a slow drip. I love this coffee maker and for $30 you cannot go wrong! Now I don't have to take trips to our local coffee shop and I'll be saving $4 a cup \u263a\ufe0f.ETA- yes, the coffee comes out hot because you're suppose to add ice to your cup for a \"iced coffee\" lolol. Don't worry about adding too much ice, fill the cup all the way to the top with ice, by the time the coffee is done you'll have a perfect amount of ice and not too much.",

This item allows me to quickly make a large glass of iced tea that tastes fresh. I use bulk loose leaf tea, so the cost per glass is very small. Cleanup is simple - just empty the inner basket in the trash and rinse the residual tea leafs out in the sink.",

                "reviewText": "Update: After using this quite a few times, I would recommend this product. Yes, most of the ice melts before it's done brewing, but the cup is very insulated for a plastic cup and keeps the drink cold for a long time. I will be keeping it after all. It does a good job for the money.Original: I was a little skeptical, but this got great reviews and Mr. Coffee is a great name so I tried it. Machine is nice enough. Easy instructions and easy to use. However, I love my iced coffee full of ice and freezing cold. I'm not sure what kind of ice other reviewers are using, but I used big ice cubes from my fridge maker and filled the tumbler. By the time the coffee was done brewing over it, ALL the ice was melted. I was a bit saddened by this. I would say the drink is definitely cold, but I'm not sure I like the fact that there's no ice left. Not sure I'll be keeping this.",
