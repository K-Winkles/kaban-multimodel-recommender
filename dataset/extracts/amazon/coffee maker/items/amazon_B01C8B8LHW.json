                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this both in my office to make coffee, as well as in my traveling van. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. The first unit lasted about 8 years, and I\u2019ve just bought a replacement when the first slowed down. It consumes about 600 watts, and the heating element shuts down automatically when the water is used up. Some reviewers have mentioned their concerns about no automatic shut off. I\u2019ve tested this unit with a watt meter, and though the light stays on, the heating element definitely turns off. It makes a good cup of drip coffee, without the need for a k-cup or disposable filter. I carry a small container for the used grounds which I compost, so this makes coffee on the road with no waste in the landfill. It can also make tea or hot chocolate. It takes about 3 minutes to make a cup of coffee, and can handle up to about 14 ounces. This coffee maker is a terrific value. It\u2019s well made, works simply and efficiently, and lasts years.",

                "reviewText": "I waited four months before reviewing this because of some complaints about this coffee maker not lasting long. But the directions on the machine are very, very clear: turn it off when it is done brewing, and unplug it. I don't know why unplugging it matters - that doesn't make much sense, but I do it anyway. My suspicion is that the heating element fails if you keep the machine on after it is done brewing, SO TURN IT OFF and I think you'll be fine.And I mean, turn it off immediately after it is done brewing. If you're the type of person who is going to brew a cup and disappear for awhile, then, if I'm understanding the directions and other reviews correctly, you'll be disappointed. So just wait a few minutes for it to brew. It only takes a couple minutes. Then turn it off.Did I mention you should turn this thing off? Instead of complaining about it not working after you don't?As for the coffee brew itself? It's great. The filter is perfectly shaped and the filter holes are perfectly sized. It's easy to clean, too. Super easy to use. The brew is excellent, actually as good a coffee as I've had from any machine. For 20 bucks, I'd probably use this in place of any larger machine even if I needed a larger one.",

                "reviewText": "I first ordered this coffee maker because of the great reviews and cost. It does make good coffee and is easy to use but our first one died after 3 months. We tried to do a warranty claim though the company but forget it... their customer service bites. After at least a dozen emails and multiple request for videos of a non-functioning DOA unit (every time we sent a video there was some reason it was not correct???) we gave up after a month correspondence. The time we spent on this was not worth the price f the coffee maker. Against my better judgement my wife ordered a 2nd one when it was on sale. Since the unit does not have an auto off function I thought maybe my wife had left it on too long. Because of this I bought a timer switch that automatically turns off after 5 minutes thinking that this would avoid the issue on our second unit. That unit also failed after a few months. The timer switch I bought did not solve anything. Unless you want a paper weight that looks like a cheap coffee maker avoid this like the plague. The warranty is worthless.",
