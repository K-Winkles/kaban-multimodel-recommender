The reusable brew filter holds up to 16 tbps. of coffee. Insert brew filter inside carafe and slowly pour 2 cups of water over coffee to dampen. Once coffee is damp fill the remainder of the carafe with water. Tighten lid and place in refrigerator to cold brew for up to 24 hours (strength is related to brew time). For ultimate flavor extraction, stir grounds during brewing process. After you are done remove the mesh brew filter from carafe. Easily remove the bottom lid to release used coffee grounds. Always remove brew filter before pouring coffee.",

Cold brewing is nothing more than letting your coffee steep in cold or room temperature water for up to 24 hours. The result is more richly flavored coffee. With the Primula Burke Cold Brew Coffee Maker, you can easily brew your own cold brew coffee with a smooth, robust flavor that is less acidic than hot coffee.

I heat 48oz of water and add sugar and let it cool in the fridge for a couple of hours. Add 1 cup of grounds to the pot add the cold water/sugar mix and stir. Stir before i go to bed, stir in the morning and when the 24hr's is up stir one last time and pour it through the filter. Then add the coffee to the Nitro keg i have and enjoy. This coffee maker is well built and easy to use and clean. i recommend it to anyone who like cold coffee.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t get the negative reviews - I LOVE this for making cold brew coffee. My tips:1. If it is taking you FOREVER to get the water to initially seep through the coffee into the pot, then you are most likely using coffee grounds that are TOO FINE for cold brew! You want to use a COURSE GROUND coffee! I really like the Bizzy Cold Brew Smooth and Sweet coffee. Don\u2019t be misled by its name - it has NO sweetener added to it - the name just refers to the coffee\u2019s flavor profile\u20262. Even though this pot says that its parts are dishwasher-safe - HAND WASH everything. All parts wash quickly with warm water and a little dawn dish soap!3. To make the coffee, I put the grounds into the filter area in the pot, add room temperature water, put the lid on and let it sit on the counter for about 5-6 hours. I take a table knife from my silverware drawer and stir the grounds around (within their filter area) a couple times during this initial 5-6 hour soak. Then, put the pot into the frig and let it soak there overnight. After about 8-9 hours in the frig I take it out, stir the grounds around again with the table knife (within the filter area), let it sit for a few minutes and then lift up the filter. Hold the filter over the coffee, tilting it a little to let as much liquid as possible drip out from the filter into the coffee. I think I tilt the filter and balance it against the pot over the coffee to let it drip that way for about 5 minutes\u2026. Then take the filter all the way out. I dump the grounds onto a plastic tray and let them dry out - then give them to a gardener!.4. As soon as you have dumped the grounds out of the filter, unscrew the bottom cap and rinse out the filter! Then rub a couple drops (you don\u2019t need much) of dawn blue dish liquid between your thumb and index finger and then use those fingers to rub the soap all around on the filter - inside and out. This takes only a minute or two and gets it totally clean! Rinse well and let it dry\u2026. It gets totally clean this way with no staining!.5. I immediately transfer the coffee out of this pot into a borosilicate glass pitcher for storing in the frig.Then, HAND WASH this blue pot, with just a couple drops of dawn dish detergent. It only takes another minute to wash, rinse and invert to dry. Easy, totally clean and ready for the next use when the coffee starts to run low.",

                "reviewText": "I like a cup of iced coffee now and then, but don't like to pay Starbucks or other coffee house prices. The solution is to buy a cold brewer like this if you're an occasional consumer, and don't want to shell out bigger bucks for a fancier unit. There's no bells and whistles here, fully manual operation, but the brewer works, and for the price of a few store-brewed ice coffees, you've got your own thing. Just add fewer or more grounds to adjust brew strength, and sit it in your refrigerator to brew. Clean up is a bit messy, but we all suffer for what we want, right? And don't drop it, as it does have a breakable glass component. Other than that, a purchase worthy of your consideration!",

And since we don't always agree on coffee flavors. I had to buy the white one for myself.I have a few other brands of cold brew pitchers , but this is by far the best. The biggest selling point is the grounds holder in the center. I love that it has the little screw piece on the bottom that releases for easy cleaning. It makes things so much easier. Because I love cold brew so much i'm basically making coffee every other day.",

It's cute, super well made and it's easy to make cold brew coffee with it. I suggest getting two if you're a cold brew fan, as it empties quickly. You also have to take into account that once done, when you remove the middle part that infuses the coffee, the level of the coffee goes down, so freshly made, there is already about a cup less. In my photo, the multicolor (bought years ago, I don't think this color is still available) is the one that is infusing and the mint is the one that is ready to drink. You just use a frother, in another container, with your barista oat milk (milk or cream of your choice), vanilla and cinamon (if you want : sirup of your choice in this foam preparation or/and in the coffee tumbler) and pour the prepartion on the top. I assure you that it's just as tasty and good looking as Starbucks cold brew and you save on the trip and the 7$ coffee!",
