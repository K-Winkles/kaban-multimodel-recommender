Iced coffee is hot-brewed coffee that's cooled and poured over ice, resulting in a diluted taste. In contrast, cold brew coffee is made by steeping coffee grounds for 8-24 hours in water at room temperature. This slow extraction process creates a concentrated coffee that's less acidic, richer in flavor, and has a higher caffeine level. Cold Brew can be served over ice, straight from the fridge, or in caf\u00e9-style drinks.",

I bought this because of the internal filter tube that allows the grounds to be exposed to the water from the inside and outside of the main filter. It really seems to work because the coffee grounds were wet all the way through. Good job on this product!",
