                "reviewText": "Lalord Pour Over Coffee Maker is a wonderful addition to my coffee bar. There is just nothing quite like a good pour over coffee (and a double pour over for that matter). On the back of the box, it will tell you everything you need to do in order to make the perfect pour over coffee and it is literally quite fantastic at it.Inside of the box you will find the Glass Carafe, 100 V60 Paper Filters and a Glass Lid for doing the actual pour over. All of it looks really quite nice and is quite functional. The only area I dinged this (and really it's a 4.5 out of 5 for me but I cannot reflect that), is that the glass is actually extremely thin (huge plus for it being borosilicate glass but a large negative for the overall thickness). The problem with borosilicate glass when it is this thin is that it can be brittle (funny enough, it's also known for it's strength even when being thin), My point really is that something like this with parts that need to be interacted with really ought to be thicker for extra durability as I can easily see one wrong move and shattering the glass.For the price point, I certainly see a very great value here and would recommend it, just make sure to treat it with care knowing that it's extremely fragile and that it will likely not survive a drop.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first ever pour over brewer and today was my first time trying it. Real newbie here.The first thing I thought when I opened it yesterday afternoon was how beautiful it was. I find it looks even prettier in person than it does online. And such a nice size.Today I got to use it for the first time, and despite some fumbling around trying to learn to make pour over coffee for the first time, I STILL managed to make myself the best cup of coffee I have ever had. This is the only way I ever want to make coffee again.All the elements of the coffee just came together perfectly. Honestly, I made it a bit strong and usually I hate strong coffee as it tastes bitter to me. But when I had another sip, I realized it was just so perfectly blended that I wouldn't have changed a thing.I'm in love with this system.I also love how you can put the filter in the carafe's top to drain when not using the top, I was happy to get a filter holder that was glass as I felt sure that would not impart any taste to the final coffee. And the wood adds such a beautiful accent. Just looking forward to using it for years to come.",
