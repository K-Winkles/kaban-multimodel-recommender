As luck would have it, I was cleaning up the keurig and it would not pump up water. I tried everything in the world to get the keurig to work but alas, it would not. Luckily, this instant pot coffee maker was still sitting in my car, Ready for action.It makes a great cup of coffee. Absolutely adore the BOLD option.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go back to a keurig.

                "reviewText": "I bought a single serve Keurig in September of 2023. By January the coffee temperature was warm but not hot. I have been buying Keurig coffee pots for a number of years but they have been going down hill. This coffee pot makes hot coffee and also has a reservoir that holds 40 oz but still has the same footprint as the Keurig. You can choose from 8, 10 and 12 oz servings. I can use my refillable filters and pods. So far, I am very pleased with this coffee maker.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this due to the current reviews at the time. I waited before submitting mine. I love the size and the features, however when my husband was making my coffee(he\u2019s amazing), he said \u201cbe careful the coffee machine is spraying hot water when brewing\u201d. Because I\u2019m low vision, legally blind I need to be especially careful with how I handle appliances so when I made coffee I felt like I was being hit with hot water missiles. NOT GOOD. My back Kerrigan which is showing signs of retirement after 2 years is still trustworthy. I went back and ordered another Kerrigan with the feature now added called \u201cstrong\u201d, which I take to mean \u201cbold brew\u201d. This goes back to dangerous for the disabled.",

                "reviewText": "Love this coffee pot so when my current one broke after 4 years I ordered a new one. It was delivered yesterday in a box that looked like it was opened and resealed. When I opened the product box, again it looked like it was opened and clumsily repackaged. It didn\u2019t look like it was used so I set it up and ran a cleaning cycle as directed. Still worked this morning so we will keep it. It should have never been sent out that way! Update: broke after 1 week of use.",
