I like it better than any I\u2019ve had in years. It also makes enough coffee for our crowd.As other reviewers have mentioned, the only drawback is the fact that a little bit of liquid gets trapped under the spout. This isn\u2019t a problem at all; if you\u2019re using the carafe to fill the reservoir, just empty the teaspoon or sof water out. If you\u2019re pouring coffee out, just empty the teaspoon of coffee out into the sink.Re: the carafe and spout\u2014this coffeemaker\u2019s carafe is much better designed than any others I\u2019ve had. It pours beautifully and unlike my last 2, doesn\u2019t spill anywhere.A lot of coffeemaker for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "Oh my gosh but there's so many good things to say about this!First, the rain water verses straight water allows all the grounds to be utilized.The reusable filter keeps grounds from going through.And the best thing? The \"keep warm\" feature! My husband gets up at 4am and used to have to turn the old pot on and off again so it stays hot for me when I get up at 6. You can set it to stay hot for up to 4 hours!Highly recommend",
