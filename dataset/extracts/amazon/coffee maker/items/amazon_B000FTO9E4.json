There are pictures for us barbarian English speakers though, but I still wanted to do this right. So in a nutshell, if you have a Dolce Gusto, here you go:One bottle of this stuff in the water tank (one measure)Four measures (.5 L) into the water tank (I just use the empty bottle)Follow the rest of the instructions on the machine.That's...it. Start to finish about fifteen minutes, and my espressos are coming out much better now. The flow is much improved and I'm very happy with this. It's also given me an opportunity to learn some German, so there's an educational aspect to this product.Really, it works great. I'm more confident in this than I am with some home formula that someone posted on Reddit. Just do it.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 10-year-old $35 Krups espresso maker. The tank was coated with 1/4 inch thick lime/calcification... I can only imagine what the inside pipes looked like. I was beginning to think the water wasn't spurting out as fast as it used to, so the espresso grind would be soaked too long and the bitter taste would go into the cup along with the delicious early drips.So I researched the decalcification options here on Amazon. didn't do outside research, though. Should I spend $13 on decalcifying, or buy a new espresso maker for $45? Tough. I opted to try decalcification. I was sold on using this liquid approach, as opposed to the cheaper powder, since my problem was so extreme. Hard water over 10 years builds up.I got two bottles with this package, and followed the instructions on the first exactly. Pour it in the tank, add 1 bottle-ful of water to the tank, and then run the espresso cycle. Then rinse a few times. It expressly said NOT to let the solution sit in the tank for any period of time. I noticed that some calcium deposits were left behind. What to do? I still had one more bottle to go, so I pour it in along with the water. This time I let it sit. (Elsewhere in the instructions, it said to leave the solution in items like glass coffeepots, until the bubbling stops.) So I waited till it didn't bubble any more - about 5-10 minutes. Then I ran the espresso maker cycle and rinsed again. This time, the tank was spotless! But...The downside was that the solution got rid of the huge build-up inside the tank, but I don't know about the bits of piping that lead the water out of the tank into the coffee grinds. I might have let the build-up go too long. Because what happened then was that small bits of the white calcification, about the size of grains of sand, were plugging up some of the tiny holes where the water pours out of the espresso-maker into the coffee grind. I have a feeling that the solution dissolved completely the lime/calcium in the tank, but didn't have enough time in the pipes to fully dissolve those deposits, so some were just dislodged or broken into smaller bits that plugged the holes. They weren't all plugged up, maybe only about 10%, but still. Maybe more would come. What to do? There is a screw on that metal sieve part in my espresso maker, but it was stuck and I only stripped it trying to remove it. So, I decided to just go ahead and use the machine anyway, and it seems to be working fine.Did the product improve the operation of my espresso maker after I used it? I can't honestly say I've noticed any difference. Certainly the product claims that calcification will affect the operation and efficiency of the espresso maker... I've made espresso from this machine almost every day for the last few years, so I have it down pat. It had at least 1/4 inch of scale, which was fully removed. You'd think I'd notice a difference, but I can't say that I did. Still, it certainly didn't harm anything, and so I'm sure it was good to do.So, in summary, I would say the product works completely great, but if you have a cheap espresso maker like mine, don't worry about all their cautions. Go ahead and let the solution sit in that tank, and then what I'd do is figure out a way for that solution to run all the way through the pipes and sit for a bit. The instructions caution against letting the solution touch the plastic or other parts of your espresso maker, but it did mine no harm. I wish I had just used the first bottle and let it sit for a long time, sloshing it around and letting the solution sit in all parts of the pipeline, before flushing. Then I'd have the second bottle for next time.Bottom line: it's expensive, but works.",
