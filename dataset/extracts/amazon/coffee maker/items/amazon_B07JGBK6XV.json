                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used Mueller 20 oz Stainless Steel French press for the last week and I\u2019ve been very pleased with this product and the coffee it produces. Dollar for dollar, when paired with a good burr grinder, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll find a better way to make a great cup of coffee!I use the OXO Burr Conical Coffee Grinder set at 14 grind setting (coarse) and Peet\u2019s Major Dickinson whole bean coffee and grind three level coffee scoops of beans for about 12 seconds to produce the grounds. After placing ground coffee in the pre-heated carafe, I add just enough hot (205 degree F) water to cover the grounds, stir and let the grounds \u201cbloom\u201d a bit (30 seconds). Then I add 205 degree water to the press to the fill line, stir a bit, and place the top on the press (with plunger up). I let the coffee brew for four minutes. Then I confirm the arrow on the top of the press is pointing towards the handle and press the plunger slowly.Before I had the burr grinder I did experiment using pre-ground Peet\u2019s drip coffee grounds in this press. I pushed the plunger very slowly and poured from the press carefully. The coffee tasted great and there was very fine grounds in the bottom of the coffee cup\u2014to be expected. I drank the coffee slowly and discarded the last little bit of coffee.I really like the double-wall insulation. I preheat the press with near boiling water first, then heat the water I\u2019ll use to make the coffee. The press works very well and keeps the coffee warm for the second mug. The 20 oz size is good if you want two 8-10 oz mugs of coffee as I do each morning. If you need more coffee consider the larger press by Mueller.The clean-up is easy. Once all the coffee has been poured, I remove the top/plunger and shake the grounds out into the trash can. I then use a small silicon spatula to easily remove the remaining grounds from the carafe and place them in the trash. Then the entire press is washed in soap and water. I unscrew the filter portion and wash each part and then completely dry before reassembly. If you don\u2019t disassemble and clean each filter part, then you run the risk of small grounds and water trapped between the filter parts which can affect the taste of your coffee.The stainless steel construction looks very good and feels very sturdy. I\u2019m very happy with this Mueller French Press. I\u2019ve owned and used several other French presses over the years and this is my favorite and my favorite way of making coffee at home. The only coffee I\u2019ve tasted that has been better was from my sister\u2019s very expensive espresso/coffee barista machine at ~20-30(?) times the cost! Maybe someday I can justify that investment and the space on the counter? In the mean time, the Mueller French Press is creating exceptional coffee![Additional comparison thoughts: To get the best results from a French press you do need a way to create consistent coarse coffee grinds. The OXO Burr Conical Coffee Grinder is one of the most affordable and high quality grinders I found in my research. You can find it on Amazon. So between the OXO grinder and the Mueller French press I\u2019ve invested about $120 (the grinder was on sale a few days ago!). So comparing the burr grinder and French press together, the high-end espresso/coffee barista machine is about 6-8 times that cost and 4-5 times the volume on the counter.]",

                "reviewText": "After doing extensive research, I chose this Mueller as my first French press and I can assure you, I did indeed make the right choice! I depend on my service dog helping me with daily chores, so when I saw the reviews about glass carafe French presses breaking and shattering, I immediately ruled them out.Having over thirty years experience in design, fabrication and manufacturing, I compared the picture of this Mueller press to others and even without seeing in person, the quality differences were readily apparent. The finish on the formed stainless steel carafe is beautiful inside and out. The welded seams are done with excellent quality and polished smooth without any blemishes. Unlike many others I looked at in stores, the Mueller plunger rod has superior rigidity to ensure a long useful life. The screen filters fit perfectly and do not have sharp edges or points as is common in other brands; this attention to detail makes the Mueller much easier to clean as even my moringa, green and black tea blend easily rinses off without need to disassemble the screen assembly. The superior smooth finish on all the components also makes for easy cleaning of the entire press.Size does matter and the generous capacity means you can make one pot to last or have plenty enough to share with a friend. I have brewed from as little as one cup for my wife to a full load for me and this Mueller press works perfectly every time. What I really like is the double-wall insulating qualities which not only maintains temperature for the duration of the brewing cycle, but keeps the unused portion plenty hot enough for at least an hour as I'd forgotten that there was some left - typically I consume it all in less than thirty minutes.What does it make? Everything and it does an awesome job every time too! Like anyone who is familiar with industrial machinery, the first thing we do with any product is give it a complete and thorough test-run. In short, this Mueller passed with flying colors and as we say in the US Navy ... Bravo Zulu!Loose tea - you bet. I had no idea that cutting open the tea bag and dumping the contents into this Mueller press would make such a HUGE difference in taste! I got some green tea pre-packaged in the common tea bags and it quite literally tasted like wet newspaper when brewed in the bags. I was sorely disappointed in the tea which is supposed to be a \"premium\" product as far as boxed tea bags are concerned. When I removed the tea from the bags and brewed it in this Mueller press it was a night to day difference and it turns out the tea is actually wonderful tasting when it's not in the bags.I've gone on to brew loose whole-leaf gunpowder green tea and various sizes of chopped tea leaves from very course whole and broken moringa leaves to very finely chopped Oolong leaves. Same with coffee, this press works great with course and regular drip/percolator grinds with the only difference being that the coffee made in this Mueller press is sooooo much more tasty and satisfying! Contrary to popular opinion, I did indeed try using espresso grind coffee in this Mueller press and it does work; however, one must apply due diligence and common sense to press very slowly and allow the filter screens to do their job correctly. If you're impatient and force it, it's not going to work right so just take your time and let the press do what it's supposed to do.In closing, I highly recommend this Mueller press as the go-to for all brewing needs!MarkKw",
