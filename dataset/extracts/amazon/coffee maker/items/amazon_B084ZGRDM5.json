Any amount of water above the pot's 5-cup line WILL result in a overflow onto your kitchen counter. No big deal.The included mesh filter works great! And it IS BETTER FLAVOR without the paper taste.This brews faster than the Mr. Coffee. The Mr. Coffee claims a automatic shutoff that it doesn't have. This brewer also has no auto shutoff but it doesn't claim to either.The temperature of the brewed coffee is hot enough that you will sip with caution.....Same with the coffee kept warm......This does have a glass pot...So don't drop it.This is good bang for the buck!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this coffee maker daily for a few weeks now, it's super easy to set up and use. It even includes a reusable filter. I gave it a brisk wash and ran a plain water cycle before making an actual coffee as suggested. The first coffee had a bit of a packaging smell but after that it was all coffee smells and taste. Maybe if I washed it more thoroughly that wouldn't have happened but in the end it's all good. I totally endorse this coffee maker as a perfectly good old skool style maker.",
