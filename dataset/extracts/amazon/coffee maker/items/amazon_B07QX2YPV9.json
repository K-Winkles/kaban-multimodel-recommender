                "reviewText": "I am writing this review after more than 6 months of persistent struggles with the Jura GIGA 6, a high-end coffee machine that I regret investing my hard-earned money in. I wish I could pack it up and send it back, but the absolute lack of customer support makes this a Sisyphean task. The customer service from Jura is, simply put, non-existent. Calling them leads to endless waits on hold, and emails go unanswered. They do, amusingly, seem to accept faxes, a mode of communication I thought was left behind in the previous century.The machine itself, while aesthetically pleasing, is riddled with frustrating software and hardware issues. Randomly, the touch screen will start reacting as if there is a ghostly finger pressing it - and this happens regardless of whether the screen is dry or wet (refer to the attached photo). This has me standing around, waiting for the phantom touches to stop, before I can even start making my coffee.Another particularly annoying design flaw is with the pre-ground coffee system on top of the machine. One would expect that for this price point, Jura would have a system in place to prevent coffee grounds from spilling over. But alas, my hope was misplaced. More often than not, using this system results in a mess of coffee grounds at the bottom of the machine, which then requires cleaning before the tray can be refitted.Moreover, the water tray sensor seems to have a mind of its own. Despite being emptied, the machine will persist in displaying the 'tray needs to be emptied' alert. After some trial and error, I figured out a work-around - strangely enough, adding water back into the 'empty' tray seems to quell the machine's erroneous alerts.I understand that no machine is perfect, and some quirks are to be expected. But when I invested almost $4,500 in a premium coffee machine, I expected far better performance, less frustration, and most importantly, competent and helpful customer support. The Jura GIGA 6 has sadly fallen short on all fronts. It has turned what should be a delightful daily ritual into an exercise in exasperation.Think twice, or maybe even thrice, before spending your money on this machine. And if you decide to take the plunge, I suggest you also invest in a fax machine. It seems you might need one to communicate with Jura's customer service.In summary, I deeply regret my decision to purchase the Jura GIGA 6. It's a beautiful piece of design that's hampered by numerous frustrating quirks and abysmal customer service, which altogether makes it a poor investment for coffee lovers.Rating: 1 out of 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Very fun to use but a few issues that should be tweaked. Menu touch screen too sensitive to start the drink when I only wanted to slide to the right for more drink options. It starts the drink and really no way to cancel very effectively, keep having to press cancel during the drink pouring out. As of right now I don\u2019t see a way to custom create my own drink. There is only one way to change the preset drinks. Example would be to have 14 seconds milk foam with 30 seconds of milk so I can add my own hot chocolate. I know it\u2019s a coffee machine but it\u2019s really handy for a nice foamy chocolate. Just would like a feature to turn off the coffee grinder completely.Update:Love the machine so far. Customized my own Hot Chocolate by setting to the lowest setting of coffee. The cancel feature is terrible though, must get fixed, it keeps going and I have to keep pressing cancel. The way you have to edit and customize your drinks is very awkward. If you don\u2019t hold down just right, it will make a drink instead of going into edit mode, wasted many drinks this way trying to get into the edit mode. I wish we could update with new firmware from the website as improvements are made.The app would be nicer if you could customize the drinks that are on the machine and not just App drinks. A few more spaces for labeling drinks are needed, we have to abbreviate especially if we want to show decaf icons. But over all still happy with machine. I wonder if Jura would allow us to send in for these corrections when they get fixed?",

                "reviewText": "The Giga 6 was quite expensive. A *very* big reason for this purchase was fully expecting to be able to start a perfect cup of coffee from bed in the morning. This turns out to be Not At All Possible. * You must completely reconnect, from the beginning, the app to the machine Every Single Time you use it.The connection experience is beyond terrible and the reliability of that connection is even worse. This makes the experience awful. The Giga 6 machine itself remains reliably connected to my wifi. The app however, has advanced Alzheimer's and must be reintroduced to the machine every single day. Like \"50 First Dates,\" but a heck of a lot less funny. Really pisses me off. Every day.*For everyone else who has the same terrible problem, go to your Jura coffee machine that is probably already reliably connected to your wifi. To re-introduce your Jura to JOE, tap the top round button on your Giga 6 to enter Jura settings. Rotate the dial until you get to Wi-Fi connections, then, tap disconnect, and then start your reconnection procedure all over again. You'll have to do this every single time you want to use the app. The first several times it will tell you it's unsuccessful and require you to turn that 40 pound machine around so you can reach the back, unplug it, unplugged the Wi-Fi, connect, and plug it back in to restart yet again.It's not worth it. I've deleted the app. I'm debating whether or not to return the giga six, I'm still within the return window. That app was very important to me that it works.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased 15+ Jura coffee makers over the years, including two Giga 5s which performed flawlessly. I should have kept the Giga 5. I bought the first Giga 6 from Amazon and it had numerous problems, not the least of which was the near impossibility of reseating the drip tray after emptying the grounds container. This Giga 6 also had brewing problems & was returned to Jura for replacement. The second Giga 6 exhibited the same drip tray reseating problem. I later traced the problem to coffee grounds accumulating in the back of the machine preventing the drip tray from reseating properly. The Jura Capresso rep who called me this morning would not acknowledge a problem. He insisted I merely needed to readjust my grinding, and everything will be fine, which is total nonsense. Stay away from these machines. This once fine company has lost its way.",
