Er sch\u00e4umt Milch (normale Milch, Hafermilch, Mandelmilch, etc.) schnell und perfekt auf. Selbst Eigelb kann man damit schlagen. Auch super f\u00fcr Matcha-Tee. Zu reinigen ist er super einfach (im Vergleich zum Milchaufsch\u00e4umsystem der Kaffeemaschine), einfach Spitze unter Wasser halten. Platzsparend ist er auch. Echt ein super Ger\u00e4t!",
