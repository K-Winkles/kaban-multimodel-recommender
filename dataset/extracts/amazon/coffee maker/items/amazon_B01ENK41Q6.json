                "reviewText": "I've used pour over coffees for years. From pour strainers to single server pouches that hook onto your cup. Both solutions require you to pour and wait, and pour some more. The pouches that hook into your cup are great travel solutions, but they also prevent you from filling the cup. The OXO pour over coffee maker is a much less attention-intensive solution because now I can just set the device on top of my mug (any size or shape, which is nice), and pour a full 12-14 oz of water into the reservoir, and it will drip down at the perfect speed into the filter, and then into the cup. I just have to pour and walk away!If you are the sole coffee drinker in your house, or generally only need one cup at a time, this is the simplest, most hassle-free solution out there. Even easier than pods, and with less cleanup and maintenance of the machine. Also tastes better than pod solutions, as you can use whatever high quality coffee grinds that you want.",

With an electric water kettle, it takes about the same time with no muss, no fuss. Faster clean up with no vinegar treatments or constantly rinsing out the press container and strainer. I bought if for boondocking with my RV but use it at home all the time as well. Saves space and makes a great cup of coffee. Only drawback is it only does one cup at a time.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars High Quality Design & Works Beautifully",
                "reviewText": "This is a very nice product which is very pleasant to use. It is very well made with excellent plastic, and ergonomically designed so that it feels good in your hands. The whole thing just feels solid and durable. The handle is roomy, very comfortable, and sturdy. The clear cup that holds the water gently clicks into place on the cone. Everything fits together well. This was very carefully designed which is always the case with the OXO brand.I think I read that this would take a few minutes to brew, but it is much faster than that. I would say that the water finished dripping through in well under a minute. I used the cover to keep the water hot while it was dripping into the cone which is optimal, but it finished fast enough so that I bet not too much heat would be lost without using the cover.This made an actually delicious cup of coffee. We are using up some older coffee that we have had in our cabinet for several months. No sense wasting it. I have been making it with a Melita drip cone, and the flavor has been a little bit too acidic, or, perhaps, oxidized, but still good. The cup I just made with this same coffee using this OXO slow-drip cone tasted significantly smoother than before. I don\u2019t know why that would be, but I guess OXO does. hahahaThis product uses #2 filters, and some are included in the box.I am very satisfied with this cute little brewing system, and I highly recommend it. It is going to be a little bright moment in my day to use something modern, attractively styled, intelligently engineered, that feels great in the hand, and works perfectly.Oh, and it\u2019s very handy that the cover doubles as a tray to hold the filter cone after brewing. This will save us paper towels and having to wash an extra cup or dish. Very clever idea.Thanks, once again, to OXO for making products for people who care about using products that are actually good. I get no benefit from saying that; I just appreciate that they put a lot of thought into the design of their high-quality products.Thanks for reading this. I think this might be only my second review. I hope you have a fulfilling day.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this daily for 3 months now. It is the best method I've ever used to make one serving of coffee, because it addresses and corrects all of my pet peeves with every other coffee making method.It's as easy to prepare (if you're using an electric kettle, which I highly recommend) as a drip machine without the size and lost counter space in my small kitchen. It tastes as good as pour over without having to get timers involved or having to use a precise technique. It's as entertaining as a French press without the messy filters, glass, and parts that require difficult and time consuming clean up.Filter in, grounds in, tank on top, fill wth water. Done. The coffee is perfect every single time. Clean up involves removing the filter and washing off the surface with a little dish soap. The quality is amazing, just as one would expect of Oxo products: hard, tough plastic that hasn't melted, cracked, fogged, discolored, or become smelly after 3 months of daily contact with acidic coffee, 200\u00b0F+ water, and admittedly neglectful treatment on my part (letting the grounds sit for a long time before clean up). It takes all that abuse and remains in the same condition as when I first opened the box. This is one of my favorite kitchen tools.I recommend brewing over a small carafe instead of your coffee cup. You could overflow your cup of you're not precise with your water, and early morning is not the best time to expect precision. A small carafe is more forgiving of mistakes, and they're pretty to boot.I also recommend an electric kettle for this and many other uses. Otherwise you're either using your microwave to boil water, which can go wrong in weird and unpredictable ways (Google it), or you're getting your stove involved for one cup of coffee. Electric kettles are cheap, fast, easy, and reliable; perfect for this application.",

But didn't like it as it would not hold much water and would sometimes collapse. Although this one takes up more space it is very sturdy and I love that I can pour all the water I need for my cup of coffee all at one time. No more continuously topping up the drip with water. I might end up getting 2. One for the camper and one for at home.",

I did have a small cafeti\u00e8re, but it was messy & difficult to clean. I have also tried with just a filter cone over a mug - but judging how much water to pour in could be tricky...This has made life so much easier and means that I get a consistent mug of coffee every morning. I also find that I need less coffee than I did in my Bodum single cup/filter setup. Having the water tank to measure the water is excellent - and the way the water slowly drips through it ensures a good brew. I usually pre-warm my mug to ensure my coffee keeps hot for longer.It is very easy to clean - dispose of the filter and grounds in the composting bin then wash everything up.",
