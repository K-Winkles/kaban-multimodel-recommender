                "reviewText": "This coffee pot was working just fine then stopped heating water. This happened within two weeks of the amazon return window EXPIRING. 5-6 WEEKS OF USE?I contacted Amazon, who asked me to contact the manufacturer. They put the warranty phone number and my purchase receipt in chat. When I asked them to send me the info via email, they ensured it would remain available in chat and they would send an email. I checked my email right away, no email from Amazon! When I looked at customer service chat moments later, it looked like the conversation had never taken place. There was no record of me contacting them!So I contacted amazon via chat again. They offered to give me a one time exception return, but I would have to pick up the shipping charge.What?I think it is unreasonable to expect customers to pay money to return an item that stopped heating after 5-6 weeks of use, especially from a supposed-reputable brand like Mr. Coffee.I have brand loyalty and this experience has me thinking it might be time for a change.I'm back to talk about the warranty submission nightmare! :-) (April 1)The manufacturer responded to my warranty request stating the incorrect problem. They sent another email with a link to a warranty information form.I gathered the photos (4 needed - two for the form, two for codes on the prongs from 75+ year old parents in another state), receipt and started to fill in the form on the warranty site. Well, guess what? The code I had was six characters; the form would only take 4. I couldn't use the first four or the last four, so I just put in the code on the pop-up info button. I didn't have the second plug prong code. The prong on the machine I purchased is blank. Awesome.Well, fortunately the submit button didn't kick me back to an additional issue, but the page that showed up indicated I couldn't see the page I was sent to since I wasn't logged in. I guess I can't see the confirmation page or can't see what? Where is the submit form supposed to take me? Hmmm. I'll check my email for a confirmation. NOPE. Is my warranty form received or not? Snail mail is better than this hack of a submission. Maybe it's designed that way. Who knows. Either way, they should be sending me money for my time dealing with this nonsense.Now, I have a new warranty case number for the issue of not being able to submit my original warranty case. Fun. Definitely buy this coffee maker if you like to spend your free time trying to sort out a terrible product.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a simple coffee maker for a 2nd home. Didn\u2019t need a lot of bells and whistler. Easy to set up and program out of the box. Brews coffee quickly and keeps it warm. I also chose this one as so many coffee makers are well over 14\u201d tall and I have a low clearance below my cabinets and this ft.",

                "reviewText": "I am happy with the quality of the coffee that it makes. However something is wrong with the clock and the shut off timer. The clock has a tendency to run fast where it'll be a few minutes ahead after a couple of weeks. It will also switch from a.m. to p.m. without notice (or vice versa). So that makes setting the coffee pot a trial sometimes when you expect coffee at 7:00 a.m. but all of a sudden the clock has changed and it doesn't work. Also the coffee timer is supposed to last 4 hours and sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't you can go back after 2 hours and the pot will be off and the coffee will be cold.UPDATE: It died after 7 months. I think I should have returned it because of the clock. Be sure to return before the 30 days. I just thought the clock was fritzy and I just worked around it. Don't accept if not working properly!",
