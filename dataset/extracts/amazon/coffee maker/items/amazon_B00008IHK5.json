        "description": "Product Description Modern brewing technology with a retro design and stainless steel finish let Cuisinart's Brew Central coffee maker blend with vintage kitchens and ones equipped with fashionable stainless modern appliances, too. The Brew Central makes up to twelve 5-ounce cups of coffee, with two settings for serving either one to four coffee drinkers or five to twelve--just the right amount of joe for a small gathering or a thermos-size day's supply for the whole crew. The Brew Central lets you go from pillow to pot with a digital clock/timer that programs for automatic \"wake-up\" coffee, setting up to 24 hours in advance. The coffee maker can also be set to turn off automatically up to four hours in advance. If you can't wait for the brewing to finish, removing the glass carafe from the warming plate automatically pauses the brewing process for a quick pour. The hotplate temperature adjusts for hot, steamy sipping coffee with newspaper in hand, or for cup just warm enough for a swift swill on the way to work. Cuisinart also equipped this coffee maker with a swing-out basket, so you don't have to pull the whole unit out from under the kitchen cabinet to pour in the grounds. A charcoal water filter ensures optimal taste, and a permanent Gold Tone filter eliminates messy paper filters. An indicator-light shows when decalcification is needed for years of reliable use. The coffeemaker measures 14-1/4 inches high, 8 inches wide, and 10-3/4 inches deep (including carafe handle). Amazon.com Strikingly retro in brushed stainless-steel with black-plastic accents, this 12-cup coffeemaker includes Cuisinart's best brewing technology and premium features for ease and flexibility. The digital clock/timer is programmable for automatically brewing \"wake-up\" coffee at a selected time and for turning off the warming plate up to four hours in advance. Removing the glass carafe from the warming plate automatically pauses the brewing process for a quick pour, and the warming plate's temperature can be adjusted. For maximum flavor, the machine can be set to brew one to four 5-ounce cups or five to twelve cups, and it includes a charcoal water filter. For convenience, a permanent Gold Tone filter eliminates messy paper filters and an indicator-light shows when decalcification is needed. The coffeemaker measures 14-1/4 inches high, 8 inches wide, and 10-3/4 inches deep (including carafe handle) and carries a three-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack Editor's note: This is a reconditioned small appliance. Reconditioned generally means that the appliance has been returned to the manufacturer, so it may contain cosmetic blemishes. This item has a 90-day warranty.",

                "reviewText": "I have owned this item for over a year and a half now, so I think I have fully fleshed out all the positives and negatives.Positives:It is a nice sleek design, and it fits well in the space I have set for it.Works consistently, with no problems whatsoever.One particular thing I like about it is that the container for the coffee filter is removable, making for easy cleaning.It beeps to let me know when it is finished brewing the coffee.Auto shut-off. I would absolutely have forgotten to turn it off, ruining the pot, if not for this feature.Water level \"steps\" inside the water compartment.Though this was listed as a reconditioned model, there were no discernible signs of damage, wear, or anything that indicated it was not new.Negatives:The only negative I can think of is the size of the opening for pouring the water. I have to pull it out into the light, and carefully pour the water while looking into it to see the water level.Others have mentioned that the cover on the carafe doesn't flip up, allowing easy filling. It must be removed. I don't pour water in using the carafe, so I didn't encounter that particular problem.Overall, I'd rate this at 4.5. But unfortunately Amazon only allows either a 4 or 5.Update:I upgraded this to 5 stars. I have owned this coffee maker for six years now, and it has never caused me any problems. I felt like this deserved the highest rating.",

It is a backup for my cranky Keurig coffeemaker. This is a good looking piece of kitchen equipment.Some of the features were pretty new when this coffeemaker first came out and I love them all: on/off timer, permanent filter basket, adjustable heat setting under the carafe, Teflon coating on the hotplate for easy cleaning. It also uses a charcoal filter but I don't care for it and don't use it and filter my water in a Brita pitcher instead.The water reservoir is not calibrated so if you want to make less than a full pot you have to measure the water in the carafe and dump it in. I usually make a full pot anyway, so it's a minor quibble for me.The main thing is that it makes a really nice cuppa joe and that's all I want in a coffeemaker.",

This \"renewed\" model arrived even more promptly than promised, looks and behaves just like a brand new one and I ended up paying only half the price of the fancy new models. Hooray!",
