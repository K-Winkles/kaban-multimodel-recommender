                "reviewText": "This is my first French press. Never used one before this and never drank coffee made with one before this. I have to be honest... this is now my favorite way to brew coffee.This Veken (I got the 34 oz in copper) is not only beautiful in the copper finish, but looks nicer on my counter than any drip or other machine ever could.It's sexy.It functions flawlessly and cleans easily with the included cleaning sponge. The additional milk frother has been great. I no longer have to shake containers to get foam.The double mesh filters do an excellent job of keeping grounds out, the plunger is easy to disassemble, wash and clean. However, until my whole beans arrive I am using pre ground coffee. It's definitely finer than you want for this setup, obviously, but it is not something undrinkable in the end. I wouldn't try to make espresso in this.Overall this machine and the coffee it produces is smooth and not over cooked in taste at all.I would buy this again and I would recommend it.Pros:- borosilicate glass!!!- nice capacity in the 34 oz- it's beautiful. The copper finish is stunning- works as it says on the boxCons:- not the biggest fan of how the handle and holder assembly are attached, i don't like having to put screwdrivers near the glass, but what else could they really do?- the carafe is tight in the holder and a little tough to remove easily, but it slides out if a little wetNot enough cons to remove stars. May update at a later time if anything goes wrong with the materials or workmanship.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about this coffee press, especially because I'd never heard of the brand name before, but I figured I'd give it a shot and, worst case scenario, return it if it didn't pass muster. Boy, am I glad I got this.My fiancee and I had tried two coffee presses prior to this (avoid the IKEA model, as it is garbage!) and this one trumped them both, hands down, in both quality of the coffee press and of the included accessories. Seriously, the free milk frother they give you is stellar, as is the bamboo mixing spoon and the measuring spoon. Frankly speaking, we figured we wouldn't use the accessories and they'd be garbage, but we now use them literally every day. They're of unparalleled high quality and very durable -- it's now been three months since we first got this and the press itself and all the accessories are holding up perfectly. We couldn't be happier.The action of the press is impressively consistent. French coffee presses typically let through a few grounds with each batch of coffee, and that's a tolerance you just have to accept when using one. Not with this model. We've made probably 100+ batches of coffee over the past three months now, and not once have I encountered a single coffee ground in my cups, even though we use a relatively fine grind (you're supposed to use coarse ground coffee, but I prefer it fine). Color me wildly impressed.The glass is very thick and high quality, which adds to its durability and keeps the coffee hot for longer. Cleaning is a breeze and the whole mechanism of the press comes apart for those times you want to do a deep clean. Putting it back together is simple and intuitive. I could go on and on, but just know that this is a high quality coffee press with high quality accessories. You will not be disappointed.Another huge plus: Veken's customer service is outstanding, which to me was surprising. I don't expect to get great customer service from sellers on Amazon, but they definitely subverted my expectations! I really can't say enough good about them as a company and the products they make.Seriously, get this coffee press if you're in the market. You will be pleasantly surprised at how good it is!",

I found this Veken and the price was good and the quality was there so I decided to pull the trigger and get it. The unit came a day early so that's always nice and it was packed very snugly so no damage could occur. But unlike my previous press, this Veken came with everything I needed to prep, make and get ready for the next event :). I added a couple of pics, only because I was impressed with the design, quality and additional tools they included. Very Nice Touch. I especially enjoy the wooden spoon and the VERY Clear instructions. The container also has very clear water level markings and the handle is contoured very nicely to fit my hand and keep it far enough away from the hot container so I don't burn myself. Everything fits snugly so I appreciate the attention to detail in the look and the engineering of the coffee maker. Even the directions were printed out in such a way to give the feel of quality... I LOVE this coffee maker! You have a repeat customer Veken. Keep up the Quality !",

                "reviewText": "It's easy to clean because you can easily disassemble the filtering mechanism and wash it under hot water, it's rugged, the metal base is welded... it even looks nice. Five heaping tablespoons of your favorite coffee and a liter of water and you're off to the races. I got into coffee presses because my brother-in-law likes them... I had been using a drip coffee maker. These, along with a hot pitcher, make the process of making coffee a breeze. Just put a little over a liter of water in the pitcher and switch it on, then put the coffee in the press, and in a couple of minutes you have boiling water. Pour it over the coffee, set a timer for 3 minutes, then put the press in and put enough pressure to move it... you don't have to press hard... until the press bottoms out. You have nutritious, delicious coffee... the nectar of the gods.",

                "reviewTitle": "Fractured glass and wobbly",
                "reviewText": "Received the press quickly via courier from US to AUS. Initially upon opening I was delighted with how the press appeared and all the extras included in the box, well presented and packaged. Upon closer inspection I found a hairline fracture at the spout which catches my skin and finger nail to touch. Looking closer at the press it also stands uneven meaning it wobbles. I have pictured these issues even though difficult to capture in a photo. I saw in the sale description this statement-\u201cNotes:In the transportation of the Veken French Press, we have had a 1% breakage rate. If you receive a damaged package, please take a photo and then write an email. We will send you a NEW Veken French Press, and you will not have to return the broken item.\u201dI can\u2019t find where to send a message besides through to amazon customer service. I was informed I must return the item for a refund. I was offered a partial refund and not for postage costs. I have no doubt at all if I disregard the wobble and attempt to use hot water in the press the glass will shatter due to the fracture. Returning this item just leaves me disappointed. What a waste of time, cost, effort and energy of a courier service and also for the business, myself and amazon customer service.The statement on the description is incorrect and I\u2019m not too sure who should take responsibility for it. If \u201cVeken\u201d can look closer at the standard of the product being produced and sent out to customers that would be mostly appreciated. I really appreciated other people\u2019s positive reviews which influenced my purchase, just a shame mine was not to standard. I have received a full refund processed through Amazon Au.",
