Interesting but 20 mins to heat the sand and then another 10 to make the coffee.This electric coffee maker took 40 seconds to make a cup of very good Turkish coffee. Yes, it didn't have the nice looking foam top. However the coffee was great and done in record time.What you need to know before you buy and use, is that:1. There is no on/off switch Once it's plugged in and on the base, it's on2. This cooks VERY quick. You NEED to stand there and watch it.3. The Stainless Steel pot makes it very easy to clean.4. The short handle makes it a bit difficult to poor.5. The folding handle is a connivence for storing. However I don't know how this will hold up over time. At this price point it is a very small concern.Overall, this is a good deal for a very quick, and good cup of Turkish coffee. I'll be ordering another one for our shore home.",

                "reviewText": "As a miniature kettle - a concept I never knew I needed in my life, but I absolutely do - this is excellent. Super fast to heat, great size for an individual cup of tea, very easy to clean, etc. It's basically perfect as a kettle, and if that's what I had bought it as it would be 5 stars.I cannot make good Turkish coffee with this. I've tried fresh ground and commercially ground Turkish coffee, I've tried varying coffee-water ratios, with and without sugar, cold start, hot start, boil once, boil three times. I cannot get decent foam/froth. I am absolutely, 100% not a coffee expert, and have never made Turkish coffee before buying this. So some of it is probably lack of skill. I've drank a lot of good Turkish coffee though, I've put solid time into testing variations, and I've read everything I can easily find (in English) online. The one variable I can't test - and which the internet suggests is super important for froth - is heat/speed. Medium-low heat, heated slowly. This thing just blasts the water straight up to boiling, even with 4 (Turkish coffee-size) cups of water. Which, again, is an EXCELLENT feature for a single-serving kettle. But I think it's probably not great for Turkish coffee.I think I would've given it 4 stars if it didn't specifically say \"Slow Brewing\" in the name. Truth in advertising goes a long way.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ordered this to use on the days I don\u2019t have time to wait for a true traditional cup of Turkish coffee. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, this will make a cup of true Turkish coffee as long as you use the proper ingredients. The coffee will taste like a cup of Turkish coffee but it will be missing the crema which is the foam on top of the coffee. This fast brewing Ibrik is unable to produce the foam top. The foam can only be produced by slowly brewing the coffee over several minutes in a small four to eight ounce ibrik, preferably over a flame.When our new ETHNIQ Turkish Coffee Pot arrived we were sad to discover that the Ibrik had a dent on the side of it. All of the packaging was fine, so it did not get damaged during shipping. We contacted ETHNIQ\u2019s customer service and they sent us a new one and it arrived a few days later.I am most impressed, they have excellent customer service!!!About brewing coffee in this rapid heat pot, you absolutely have to pay attention to it. The coffee will likely be ready within two minutes and if your not ready to remove it from the base when the it starts boiling, if you wait to long, as I discovered my first time using it, the coffee will boil right over the brim and make a terrible mess.Once I figured out when to remove it, I have experimented with taking it on and off the base in an effort to pull even more flavor from the coffee beans. Overall I am really enjoying this Turkish coffee set. It is definitely worth the investment and I absolutely recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "This Turkish coffee maker is a useful, niche kitchen accessory. Not everyone will be able to justify the space it takes up, on account of it only having one function, but I for one appreciate having it. The first thing I noticed upon unboxing was how sturdy and thick the stainless steel was. I don\u2019t think this item could be dented or deformed very easily. When I tried making my first batch of coffee I was surprised hop quickly it boiled the water. It boils water quite a bit faster than my gas stove can. Because of this, I've been using it to make tea as well. The instruction manual doesn\u2019t explain how to clean it though, and I was a little worried about getting the heating element area on the kettle wet. Also, I had a boil over which got the bottom actual heating element wet, and I was worried about it malfunctioning. Despite these two times getting wet, the kettle seems to be working the same as before- impressive!I can easily recommend this item and give it 4 stars- one knocked off because of the confusion about whether or not it can get wet. Buy the Turkish coffee maker and enjoy tasty hot beverages in no time at all!",
