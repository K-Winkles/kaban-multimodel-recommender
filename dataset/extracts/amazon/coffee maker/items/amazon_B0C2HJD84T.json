                "reviewText": "Thinking that I was saving money, I mistakenly bought a keg of Maxwell House GROUND coffee instead of the little jar of INSTANT. OOPS. But once opened and confirmed that I messed up, I wondered if there was a way to use the coffee rather than just throw it away.Since we only drink 1-2 cups at a time, this product was the answer. The coffee making steps are even the same. Put sugar in cup. Put the filter on top of the cup. Put coffee in filter and pour.Just pour SLOWLY. I found that if you pour too much, too soon... the grounds float a little and leave a ring around the top of the cup. The filter and the cup are really easy to clean afterwards, presuming that you don't let the grounds dry. I haven't tried letting them dry, to see how difficult that would make cleaning, but I would imagine added difficulty.",
