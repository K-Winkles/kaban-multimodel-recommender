                "reviewText": "Kerig received with coupons that expired May 2023, a red flag. It would not work, trouble shooting done by manufacturer. Findings were defective purchase with an expired warranty. This happened the day item was received. Asked to send pics of pot with my name, date of purchase on paper in front of pot, model number, copy of proof of purchase, copy of post office tracking and delivery. Told no need to return, trash or recycle. After pics were received, immediately received email the info ie pics were not acceptable. Upon receiving Kerig a replacement would be sent. Followed by request for my physical address (I use PO Box) as UPS would pic item up at place of abode. I then receive email with bar code to use at Staples to return via UPS. So today after inconsistencies I\u2019m going to Stables hopefully for a successful return. Problem is at manufacture in that they mail item not Amazon. They do not check model numbers, warranty expirations, and sell useless items. Poor PR for consumers. Forgot to mention the troubleshooter asked if had K pod in pot. Answered no, and stated per directions one is to first run water through FIRST before making first cup of coffee.Today February 1, 2024 I received email your Kerig is on the way. Unfortunately to physical address and not mailing address. I have PO Box for safety, live in multi apartment building where others take packages of others. This was explained in detail when they requested physical address. First Kerig was mailed to PO Box, so why not replacement?? If it is stolen as many packages are I\u2019m in for more corespondency, and will request refund to charge card used for payment.Replacement Kerig mailed Monday of this week via UPS and received today Wednesday. The coffee maker works fine and I like the upgrade, btw no additional cost. It comes with large water reservoir so no need to add water for each cup. When warm weather come will try ice coffee feature, I\u2019m sure it will work fine too. It took some time to resolve issue but it is now resolved. I would purchase Kerig products again, good maker, and customer support is accommodating.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great unit for single use or couples",
                "reviewText": "I've owned several Keurigs in the past, including the ill fated Vue. I like this unit the best of all of them. But you have to understand it intended use and how it works to appreciate it.1st, it doesn't pre-heat and stay hot like the bigger, multi-person units, when they are simply turned on. It only starts to heat when you press the big brew button. Once it's done with the brew the heater turns off, meaning it needs to pre-heat again for any additional cups.2nd, after you press the brew button, you have to be patient as, unlike the multi-person, larger and more expensive units, it has to heat the cold water. For me and my cold tap water, this takes just under 3 minutes before the cup is complete. In the end, this unit is much more energy efficient as it isn't always heating when simply turned on.4rd, if you are a single or maybe two person coffee household, this unit is perfect. If you have 3 or more drinkers or throw a lot of gatherings where coffee would be served, the bigger and more expensive multi-cup units would be better for you.What sets this unit apart from others is :1) It's really small and doesn't take up much counter space, built-in cord storage and coffee bin are nice as well2) It's really easy to keep clean, as there aren't a dozen things to take apart to clean or difficult places to try and shove paper towel into.3) Does a good hot cup of coffee, no need to adjust temperature as it's comes up too hot to drink right away... Like a coffee maker should!4) Water bin is easy to add/remove, easy to fill, easy to clean, easy to dry - compared to the multi-cup makers5) Unlike other makers, the design is clean, modern, yet simple and doesn't have stupid curves or wasted spaces. This makes the unit easy to add water, brew, use and clean comparably6) The design is so efficient that there's not a single drip, at least for me, once the brew is done. I'm used to other Keurigs which drip for a minute or two afterwards.The one design issue that affects impatient people is that the brew LED seems to have no rime or reason. You really can't rely on it to determine what step it is in during the brew. I just press the brew button, verify the LED is no longer solid for a couple seconds and walk away for a few minutes or listen for the empty air sound that occurs at the end of the brew cycle if I'm in the kitchen doing other things.In the end I highly recommend this maker for single or dual-household coffee drinkers or those who drink coffee irregularly. However, if you are an impatient person who can't value a small, easy to maintain, energy efficient coffee maker with a simple design, you will hate this coffee maker. It's coffee people, not rocket science. The quality and age of the coffee and pod design/filter are the most important factors. The coffee maker just disperses a controlled amount of hot water to the overall process. In this last factor, I find this unit to excel.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my elderly father who had recently complained that he didn't drink coffee much anymore because \"making a cup (decaf) just for myself is too much work\". This has been perfect for him. Could it have better flavor? Sure, it isn't meant to be a gourmet top notch coffee machine, not for the price point. This is meant for ease of use and simplicity and it does not disappoint. Even my small coffee drinking kiddos come to grandpa to make a cup of decaf with him and can maneuver the machine all on their own. I also love the fact (for my dad) that there are so many varieties of K-cups for him to chose from. I wish there were more decaf \"flavors\" as I have only been able to find hazelnut for fun flavors but I guess that is where coffee creamers come into play so it's not a complaint. The color is so beautiful, a nice cool robin eggs blue-gray.I know the waste of the pods is an issue up for discussion but for my dad the convenience is really nice and I got him a couple of the k-cup reusable metal baskets to put his own ground coffee in. So far I have had zero issue in leaking or any other issues with the coffee machine. My dad loves it and that is perfect for me!",

Short of replacing the circuit board and coffee maker is now dead.In short, don't buy this product if you live in the UK unless you plan on having a large voltage transformer converter sitting on your bench as well.",
