Regular brew mode is suitable for those who prefer a milder coffee taste. \u25cfStrong Brew Mode: Strong brew mode is designed to extract more flavor and intensity from the coffee grounds, resulting in a bolder and stronger cup of coffee. In this mode, the coffee maker increases the water temperature slightly and extends the brewing time to enhance the extraction process. This mode is often preferred by those who enjoy a robust and pronounced coffee flavor. \u25cfOver Iced Brew Mode: Over-iced coffee is a popular cold beverage made by pouring brewed coffee over ice.

The GAVASTO iced and hot coffee maker brews hot, concentrated coffee directly over ice to quickly cool the hot coffee. This process gives you iced coffee in under 3 minutes, maximizes flavor extraction, and leaves you with a refreshing cup of iced coffee. Can I fill the tank with hot water? Must be filled with room temperature water of about 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) in the water tank of GAVASTO coffee machine, instead of heated water. Why does coffee overflow when I use an 8-ounce cup and point to the 8-ounce button? The flow rate of the single cup coffee maker varies depending on the type of coffee powder. The flow rate calculates by range, not value. 1-2 OZ error in the flow rate of the coffee machine is reasonable. We suggest testing the position of the cup that corresponds to the different capacity options you use to avoid overflowing coffee before the first use.",

                "reviewText": "Generally satisfied with this unit. My Kuerig finally died on me so I wanted a not-so-expensive replacement. Decided on this unit.Pros1. Makes a great cup of hot coffee.2. Sleek design! It's footprint on the counter is much smaller than my previous single cup unit.3. The extra bold option works as promised, making the coffee about 25% stronger imo without making it taste weird.4. Trick: if you don't like your coffee piping hot like me, use the iced coffee option, the water comes out less heated.Cons1. Made in China.2. The main reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the 6/8/10/12 ounce options. They are all off about 1.5 ounces too much. Doesn't sound like alot but it meant the coffee came up to the rims on my usual mugs. Fortunately I had a couple larger mugs but still it is a bit annoying. This is using the 8 ounce option (for a mug!).3. It's not speedy. Figure 3 minutes, no big deal cuz I just changed my morning routine to time it right.4. It does splatter a bit more than my old Kuerig but not a show stopper for me. I'm gonna try finding something to raise the cup up more, something I read on another comment.I still haven't decided about where the refill tank is (on the back). Having it on the side with my old unit was more convenient imo. It requires a relatively steady hand when sliding it back in when refilled but it does slide in easy. Also the control panel is a bit over-complicated but it's probably due to the cold coffee option.All in all, so far I'm glad I bought the unit.",
