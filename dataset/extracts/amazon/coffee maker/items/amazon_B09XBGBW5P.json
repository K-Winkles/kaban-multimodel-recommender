Ugh - all I see is a ton of white writing telling me a bunch of stuff I don't need to see Every.Single.Day. All that \"Caution\" stuff has to be there, but would have been nice to be on the side I rarely see. Yep ... a little OCD.",

                "reviewText": "We have been using it for almost a month now, after our Cuisinart died. The coffee is very well brewed as I think the hot water is more slowly infused into the grounds than with our previous maker. I love the signal at the end when finished brewing and when the maker turns off the hot plate. The glass carafe cleans easily and does not seem to stain! Also true of the basket! A really nice new item, when most new things are a disappointment.",
