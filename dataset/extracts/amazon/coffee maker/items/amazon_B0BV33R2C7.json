                "reviewText": "My other coffee single-serve coffee maker I use at work just quit one day. (GASP!) I needed a new one STAT but didn't really want to spend a small fortune to replace the other brand only to have it stop working again, so to Amazon I came. I compared several options in the price range and I'm super glad I chose the Famiworths Mini Coffee Maker. Why?1. As you can see in the picture, it's compact. Just the right size for my favorite mugs without taking up the extra desk space the other brand required. (I included K-Cups for size comparison.) Anyway, I like the size although I don't think it would work well with a mug that is giant (height or width) or weird-shaped, but it's great with normal mugs.2. It's lightweight, which makes it easily portable if that becomes necessary.3. I use it 15-20/week and so far it seems to be functioning just fine and it's quick! It seems to be a pretty sturdy little machine.4. It's the kind where you just add 6-12 oz. water as you go, so you don't have extra water in it just sitting around collecting dust or calcifying the machine.5. It uses either regular coffee pods but also comes with a re-usable filter so you're set if you want to just scoop in your favorite brand from a can. I like coffee options! :)I haven't had it long enough to really weigh in on cleaning, but it looks like that should be pretty simple too. I'll update the review if I find that isn't the case. (But can't imagine I'll need to.)If you're looking for a good, affordable, small, one-cup-at-a-time coffee maker, I highly recommend trying this one!",

                "reviewText": "My old coffee pot died and I was desperate need of a new one. I\u2019m not very impressed by the pods because I get tired of having to empty other people\u2019s \u2019leftovers\u2019. It\u2019s not hot people, empty your pod when you\u2019re done! However, after seeing some of the flavors of coffees, teas, hot chocolate, and even cider, how could I not become excited. Then when I saw I can get a dual function pot why not.It fits perfectly in my coffee station I\u2019ve set up at home. Now I can continue to use the rest of my ground coffees try some pods as well.The coffee is made quickly and the pots shuts itself off. The coffee/beverage is good and hot.I love that there\u2019s a window on the outside to see the water level.I love that the power button is on the top making very easy to reach.It is very light weight if I needed to move it around.The only con is that there is no hot plate to keep the brewed drink hot. If you get caught up and don\u2019t have the coffee right then, you have to reheat it or brew another cup.The only other con, remove the pod before you remove the cup. If not the last few drops will drip down on the plate. It\u2019s easy enough to wipe away so not a big deal.I haven\u2019t had to to descale yet so I can\u2019t speak on cleaning.I definitely would recommend and gift this product.",

It takes up very little space on my counter. I often use the refillable cup and bought an extra since other refillable cups will not work in this machine. My only real complaint is that it seems flat on the bottom where the Kcups are brewed so I have to wipe out the machine each time or it drips. I would buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "Love my sweet little coffee maker. Quick, simple, and makes a hot cup of coffee! Easy to use. Just fill reservoir with desired amount of water. I just fill it up to the little hole in the back of the reservoir for a full mug of coffee, but there is a window with measurements on the side of the reservoir. Pop in a K-Cup, push the on button. Pretty much in a few seconds, will start pouring coffee, and it makes a cup pretty quickly. Then after it finishes and the coffee maker turns off, I remove the K-Cup pod and discard before removing my cup. Prevents drips of residual coffee. The coffee maker comes with a filter basket also to make a single cup of coffee with regular ground coffee, but haven't tried that yet. The coffee maker is much less expensive than the name brand, and works just as well. I like the idea of not letting stagnant water sit in the machine all the time. Our name brand machine at work has some green funk growing in the bottom of the water tank from water sitting in it all the time, and it never gets cleaned. I don't use that one. I make drip coffee at work. I need one of these at work!",

Kitchen smelled like something was burning it was the coffee maker!! I wish I noticed sooner! I made a cup and the mug of coffee didn\u2019t smell at all, other than like coffee! Now it\u2019s telling me to descale, but I came to check and not seeing directions as to what to use? Idk white vinegar! It works great! I would just say is it be mindful of what\u2019s happened to mine, and if yours smells or there\u2019s water /coffee on your counter, replace before those 30 days are up!!",

I normally only drink one or two cups a day. If you follow the directions and place the k-cup adapter (supplied) in it's correct position the machine makes a cup of coffee in about two minutes, good and hot! One thing I don't like is with a regular 8-10 oz cup the coffee does splash some because of the distance from the outlet down to the cup. I solved this by cutting a piece of wood the size of the cup bottom x 1 1/2 inches thick to set the cup on. Works great, no splashing. I love the coffee maker!",
