                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this coffee maker for several days and have been delighted with the results. My wife has always used our K-cup coffee maker, while I\u2019ve used a percolator for my cup of joe. Percolator coffee has always had a fuller, smoother, and more flavorful brew than other methods I\u2019ve tried.This coffee maker rivals my percolator's when I use the included coffee basket. So much so that my percolator has now been relegated to the basement.The coffee maker brews coffee slower than our old K-cup coffee maker. The results, however, really make it worthwhile. I like Starbucks Pike Place ground coffee. When I use this coffee in the included coffee basket, it tastes wonderful. The coffee basket is also very easy to clean between uses, unlike the coffee basket in our old K-cup machine. This coffee maker also performs well when using K-cup coffee pods. I appreciate the smaller footprint this coffee maker uses compared to our old K-cup machine.I had no problem adding this coffee machine to our home WiFi network. Preparing the coffee maker for brewing before I go to bed and then preparing a cup of coffee from my bed before getting up the following day is enjoyable. As I am retired, I no longer have a prescribed time to start my day. This feature is so much more beneficial for me than a scheduled brew time would provide.The coffee maker came with an excellent, illustrated, easy-to-read instruction manual. Additionally, the iPhone app includes recipes for coffee drinks that can be enjoyed. As this coffee maker is made by the same folks that manufacture the Instant Pot cooker, the same app can be used across both devices.I\u2019m happy with the performance of this coffee maker and do recommend it.",

I had a similar Hamilton Beech single cup coffee maker, and it took forever to make a single cup, this is faster in comparison.However, I am disappointed that I tried numerous times to connect the unit to the app. The instructions say press, the Wi-Fi button quickly, but the app says to hold the Wi-Fi button until it beeps and blinks. I held the Wi-Fi button for several seconds, and it beeped, but it never blinked. I tried at least 10 times to connect the coffee pot to the app and it didn\u2019t work. The one thing I was looking forward to you, was being able to have my coffee brewed before I get out of bed and that function doesn\u2019t work. There is a link in the product page to report issues with the item, and when I clicked on it, it took me to a page to report suspicious activity. So that was not helpful at all.***Edit: I was able to connect it to the app finally! I had to brew a cup first and after that all the cup selection buttons were lit up, so then I long pressed the Wi-Fi button and that worked. I got the app open and was able to connect.None of this is in the instructions, so I hope that this is helpful.",

                "reviewText": "Easily the most convenient and simple to use coffee maker I have used. I prefer using a French press myself, but if you are looking for something that is easy and makes a decent cup of coffee, this is a great option. It's pretty easy to clean and makes a tasty cup of coffee.",

                "reviewText": "I usually use a french press for most of my coffee at home on the weekends and during the week I have a discontinued model of a Hamilton Beach coffee machine for me during the working week. Yes I have to have the certain model of coffee maker, I tried their updated version and the coffee taste bad, so I went to the bay and got three used ones. If that tells you how serious I take my coffee drinking experience. This coffee maker doesn't disappoint at all, it tastes like my coffee from my french press and way easier to make and clean up. I like a strong cup of Joe, you know the type to smack you in the face and tell you to wake up. This coffee maker does that for me, makes a mean cup of Joe while my wife can make hers the way she likes it, meek and mild. The app took me a minute to get use to but now that I have it setup and have been using it with no issues for awhile. I don't know how I did without this for this long, really AWESOME coffee maker for a good cup of coffee, just when you don't have time to drink the whole pot, like I do during the week before work.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using a combo pot for many months that has regular full pot with cone filter, as well as a Nespresso pod option. I really wanted to add something that uses regular K cups, especially with holidays around the corners and house guests staying with us. I dont have a lot of empty counter space so this coffee maker works wonderfully in that its really compact and I can tuck it next to my larger machine I use more regularly. After the holidays are over I can store it in the cabinet easily without taking up too much space and since its small its easy to get out and plug in as needed. It brews quickly and equivalent to Keurig machines I have owned in the past. The wifi feature is neat but I dont really use that, just set it up to see how it works.",
