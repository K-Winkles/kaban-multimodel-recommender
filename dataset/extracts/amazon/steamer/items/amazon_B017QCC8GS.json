I will probably sew some on myself with old shoe strings or some such. They will work just fine after that. I have no issue with the quality or workmanship. Would return if I couldn't use them. It must have been different machine that these were for. The Thane H2O machine I have is an inherited one from the people we purchased our house from, so no way of knowing which ones to order. Thought they would have had some kind of way to attach to the bottom of the machine. I got some others that had ties, so these kind of surprised me.",

They fit my machine perfect and so much more absorbent than the originals, they work excellent on my hardwood floors and even better on my area carpets!! Love them and got them for an excellent price, great value!!",
