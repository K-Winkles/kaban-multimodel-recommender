                "reviewText": "Believe it or not, I've never owned a steamer in my life. I've always found regular irons so tedious to use. Because of this, I would often end up wearing wrinkly clothes. And we all know that wrinkly clothes can quickly take a 10/10 outfit down to a 5/10. I I told myself, \"no more! I'm getting myself a steamer once and for all.\" I searched Amazon for an affordable yet effective steamer, and that's when I stumbled upon this steamer... Price point and great reviews won me over. And let me tell you, I I am very satisfied!2 things that I love about this steamer:1. Attachments: It comes with additional attachments. You're not just limited to plain steam; You'll have a 2-in-1 brush too. These attachments allow me to steam different types of fabric more effectively.2. Horizontal Steaming: The standard method of steaming is usually hanging the clothing on a hanger, and steaming vertically. I love this steamer cos you can also use it horizontally, meaning the clothing is laying on a flat service. Me for instance, I often steam clothes right on my bed!! Super convenient!I've been using this steamer for about a month now, and I can confidently say that it has exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer for someone like me who always found ironing a hassle. Well... that's it for this review! Hope I helped in your decision-making.",

It can easily be packed into a checked luggage bag for easy transport.The reservoir for it is spacious and holds a good amount of water. It heats up in less than a minute and works like a charm to get out stubborn wrinkles. I was able to steam a wedding dress in around 20 minutes (which seems like a lot but is actually pretty good timing for a handheld!) It comes with several different nozzle attachments, but I admittedly haven\u2019t used those yet. The cord length is decent; and long enough for most people to effectively steam their garments.If you follow the instructions, you will see just how easy operation is with this steamer. I highly recommend it for home or on the go!",
