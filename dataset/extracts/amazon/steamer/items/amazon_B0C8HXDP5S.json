The hose gets hot so make sure to keep it away from your arm while you're using it. It could use a hand switch or standby button or something so you're not constantly turning it off or on. The cord could also be longer. And the attachments are...meh. Wish it had an assortment of attachments or at least be compatible with other brands. But for what its got, it dies what it's supposed to do.Would definitely buy again and recommend to others.",

                "reviewText": "My 2006 Lexus LX 470 came with factory protective film on the front end. It had overstayed its welcome, becoming a major detractor for my rig. I picked up this steamer thinking maybe I could get the film off with it. Now this is not a very easy job, but the steamer made it possible. After using rapid release adhesive remover, the front end looks like new. If you have a big cleaning job, this little guy actually works pretty dang good!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this steam cleaner hoping to clean and disinfect my floors and other surfaces, but I was very disappointed with its performance. The steam (warm water fine mist) was NOT hot enough. steam cleaners need to reach high temperatures and maintain contact with the surface for several minutes to disinfect and sanitize properly . This steam cleaner barely reached 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). I felt like I was just spraying fine mist of warm water, not steam. This defeats the whole purpose of using a steam cleaner, which is to use the power of heat and pressure to remove dirt and kill germs without chemicals. To test this steamer, I tried cleaning out my window sills, and it failed miserably. The picture below shows how dirty they still were after using the steam cleaner. I have a lot of experience using an industrial clothing steamer/press and using that clothing steamer, which has no pressure, would have cleaned it better than this supposedly pressurized steam cleaner. It's a glorified warm water sprayer. I do not recommend this product to anyone who wants a reliable and effective steam cleaner. It is a waste of money and time. (See image)",
