                "reviewText": "I bought this based on all of the good reviews for a \"travel STEAMER\". I have been searching for a small, foldable compact STEAMER and thought I had hit pay dirt! WRONG! There is only one tiny hole in the middle of the iron that releases what can be steam, but is usually a squirt of water.Pros: Size is perfect for travel! So small and handle shifts to make it more compact. It heats up quickly It comes with a silicone cover for the hot part of the ironCons: Not a steamer by any means. Tried it on chiffon and polyester - NOPE no steam. The sprayer for the water is more like a small faucet that dumps big drops of water on your clothes The cord is extremely short There is no stand for this steamer",
