                "reviewText": "I purchased this steamer for business trip to steam my suit before an important meeting. When I got to my hotel, I took out the steamer, and was ready to steamer my suit, I was shocked that the steamer didn't work. The power was on, but it didn't produce any steam. I had to use the steam setting on the hotel iron and try to create enough busts of steam to look presentable. I lugged the brand new, but useless steamer back home in my suitcase. So far I haven't been able to locate the original box to return it in. But I'm still looking for it. The steamer us junk. I read a few other bad reviews for this steamer, but since there was a larger number of positive reviews, I took the chance. Don't make the same mistake.",

                "reviewText": "This steamer is fantastic! It emits a TON of steam and works very well on wrinkles. I used it on 100% cotton dress shirt, cotton/polyester blend trousers and a polyester women's suit jacket - all were wrinkle-free before they were packed, but they were squeezed into packing cubes and stuffed into a tight suitcase, so they had the usual travel wrinkles pretty badly. This steamer worked on everything! Note that this steamer won't work on higher voltage (e.g., in Europe) even with a voltage adapter (I blew the fuse on my voltage adapter....so don't do that....). It is small for travel and is like travelling with a hair dryer or a big hair waver/straightener. Will definitely be packing it for all my North American trips instead of relying on a hotel iron.",
