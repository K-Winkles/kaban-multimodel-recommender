                "reviewText": "I wanted a small steamer for travel that would not take up much luggage space and would be effective removing wrinkles from shirts and scarves. This is so small I didn't think it would be as effective as my larger steamer so I was happily surprised when it is ready to steam almost immediately. It also puts out a strong burst so no need to go over wrinkles multiple times. The only downside is that the water reservoir is small (obviously it is a small unit so this is expected) so it does not steam for a long time. I am usually only steaming a couple things at a time when traveling so the steam duration does not bother me. This is so much better than using the iron in the hotel room that takes longer and is not good for delicate fabrics.",
