Works great I just purchased a bunch of curtains for my remodeled home and have mostly used to help to get any remaining creases after the steam dryer and hanging. Works great. Have also used as a quick refresh on some clothes. It is light weight and easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "PROS: This steamer has a fairly large water capacity, heats up fast, has a wide mouth, and is quick to steam out wrinkles.CONS: It's a bit top heavy and clunky. Definitely not for travel. To turn it off, you need to unplug it. There is no off button.NOTES: As soon as you fill the water jug section on the belly (which pulls out easily) and plug in the unit, it begins to heat up. There is no off button and no explanation in the directions that they ship you!!I recommend the unit, but not for travel. Also, if you begin to steam, you may need to shift hands from left to right a few times until the unit is half full because it's a bit heavy when full. If you use weights at the gym, you'll have no issues. :)",

                "reviewText": "I got this due to the reviews on power and heating capabilities. I work primarily with acrylic yarn and was able to block a queen sized blanket made with acrylic and a shawl made with merino wool. I didn\u2019t need to pre-soak or spray water on the projects prior to steam blocking because the steamer produces just enough. I had to refill the reservoir probably 2 times for the shawl and about 8 times for the blanket. Added bonus is that it gives the option to add essential oil if you want to. I haven\u2019t tested that feature yet but plan to soon. I added a picture of before blocking and then after using the steamer.",
