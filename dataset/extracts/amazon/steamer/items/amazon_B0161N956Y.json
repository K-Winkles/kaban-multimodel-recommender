                "reviewText": "purchased the Pure Enrichment PureSteam XL Standing Steamer with Garment Hanger, and my experience has been somewhat mixed. While it has its strengths, there are notable drawbacks that left me with a sense of ambivalence.On the positive side, the standing steamer design is convenient, and the garment hanger is a thoughtful addition. It makes the steaming process more manageable, allowing for hands-free operation and minimizing the hassle of holding a steamer by hand.The steamer heats up quickly, saving time when I need to freshen up my clothes in a hurry. The water tank capacity is also decent, providing ample steam for multiple garments before needing a refill. The adjustable height feature is a plus, accommodating various clothing items easily.However, my main issue with this steamer is its performance on different fabric types. It seems to work well on lighter fabrics such as cotton and linen, but when it comes to heavier materials like wool or certain synthetic blends, the results are less impressive. I found myself having to go over the same spots repeatedly to achieve the desired level of wrinkle release.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to use, worth the money and very convenient for those who hate ironing.The PureSteamXL is a great steamer that saves time and works as an excellent replacement to a standard ironing. I have used it on a variety of fabrics and clothing and it works great on everything especially, curtains, and bed linen. It heats up quickly, and produces enough steam, the high heat minimizes the time needed to get all the wrinkles! I am able to reduce the amount of items I bring to the dry cleaners, which is a great cost savings for me, as well.Steamer comes with some nice features, a hanger with a telescopic mount, a compact design, which is also easy to take apart and reassemble as needed, the space-saving design makes it a perfect choice for someone in smaller size homes. It also comes with a fabric brush attachment, which actually makes a difference when steaming shirts!The steamer is well-priced and seems to be well made and durable. I have already used it multiple times without issue. I do wish that the hose was a little bit longer, and that the switch was operated by a pedal/foot mechanism instead of a constant steam flow. However, this is no reason not to purchase the item, and would still choose this over other products out there.Overall great steamer, worth the money spent and very convenient in many aspects.",

Good steam flow, knocks most wrinkles out in about three passes. I wouldn't carry it on a trip, though. Too much to cart around with luggage and stuff. Good product, would recommend.",
