                "reviewText": "It is very portable, and can be used when traveling. I can definitely see myself bringing it on one of our trips this year. What I liked about it is that it heated up quickly, in a round 2 minutes. It is recommended that you use distilled water in the steamer to prevent having mineral build-up issues. I think that there are mineral issues in my area, so it was great to have distilled water on hand for the fabric steamer. Not a problem with filling it up, you just unscrew the nozzle head and fill it up with water to no higher than the water line, at 140 ml. Screw the nozzle head back on, and then turn the switch on the handle on! The handle area stayed comfortable while the water was heating up, and stayed cool when it started steaming. I used two of my cotton nurses' uniform tops for fabric steaming in the pictures.The steaming occurred around the 2 minute mark. Per Asani's user manual, \"safe for all fabric types\". My uniform tops we used in the pictures are 100% cotton, and wrinkle big-time, even with a wrinkle guard timer on the dryer. (They also have been hanging in our closet wrinkled for awhile!) The steamer helped a great deal on my tops, and they were cool to touch within a moment of using it! I would be wrong to say that all of the wrinkles came out, but most did! I do like the ease of filling and using the fabric steamer. I am definitely pleased with the results from using it! Besides using it on clothes, you can use the fabric steamer on furniture, curtains, and more! when you are finished with it, you can unscrew the head of the fabric steamer and allow it to cool for 10 minutes, at least. Drain the water out, and make sure that it air dries before storing. An important thing to note is that the steamer cannot be angled more than 45 degrees, especially when the unit is on. They give you information in the user manual on how to remove mineral deposits from the device, should they occur.",

                "reviewText": "This steamer is small, light and still powerful! Very easy to use. Just turn top to open, fill the tank with cold water, screw top back on, plug in and turn it on! It heats up very quickly and steam is very hot. I used on my Christmas shirt that I could not iron. Took a couple of passes to get the wrinkles out, but it still worked quickly! I had some water drip out on to my shirt when steaming, but that also dried quickly with the hot steam. Another feature I really enjoyed was the long cord. This is essential for using this product on things other than clothing like furniture and curtains. Great item to have to use all over the house!",

                "reviewText": "Great steamer... it\u2019s small enough for travel and quickly heats up (about 30-45 seconds). Holds about 4oz or so of water (I\u2019m guesstimating) so you can get a shirt done and let it run out. I hate letting water sit in these types of things so I love the fact that it has a small reservoir. It works wonderfully at getting wrinkles out. I use it especially on my Indian/ethnic clothes bc I hate ironing and worrying about the correct temp setting. The top twists on and off easily for you to fill it up. It\u2019s pretty much dummy proof. Great product at a great price. I\u2019ll be traveling with it from now on. I think I\u2019ll even grab a few for gifts!",

It works on tough wrinkles and easily smoothes them out. It took me about 5 mins to get my husbands thick cotton shirt ready for an interview. It is very handy and super easy to use. The water heats up in less than one minute and you are ready to go. It is by far one of the most efficient steamers I have used. I will be carrying it around while traveling for sure. The steam is extremely hot so be careful while handling the steamer. Maintenance is very easy. Overall an amazing buy and worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "As others have said, this steamer heats up quickly and is easy to use. The downsides? Well, first, it only holds about 1/2 cup of water, and that really doesn't last very long if you're steaming more than one item. Secondly, and this is the thing that always annoys me about steamers (and even regular irons on the \"steam\" setting), it absolutely will spit out water on the garment you're trying to steam. Some said they didn't have this problem but I've had it do this every single time I've used it. I am using it in an upright position, not tilted at all, but it still gets water on the garments. It's really frustrating to try to simply steam wrinkles out of a garment, only to have water dripping all over it at the same time. I'm starting to think it's just about as easy and takes about the same time to just run a regular iron over the garments rather than deal with the water problem.",

It is small and would travel easily. It more than does the job it was intended to do.Con\u2019sNone really. Just follow the instructions. Do not fill with water above the fill line or it does send out water briefly at the beginning. Do not use at more than a 45 degree angle. Don\u2019t confuse this with an iron. This is intended for vertical steaming!My first experience with a handheld clothes steamer leaves me happy and feeling successful.",

I tried it on knit, 100% cotton and denim. Awesome. The denim I used has been stashed away for years to be used for scraps. To begin with I had my doubts about the denim. But I held the steamer just on the surface of the material and the wrinkles started to release. Of course if you do this you risk the material getting wet spots on it. I did it only for testing purposes for myself. There were only two negatives for me; tilting the steamer causes water to spill (IDK, but all steamers may do this?). Another is the awful smell it had the first couple of times I used it.",
