                "reviewText": "Steam mops are great for cleaning hard floors but they're never supplied in sufficient quantity to get more than a small area clean before the pads are completely filthy and need washing.These pads are functionally identical to the Shark pads and attach via velcro. They clean and scrub just like the Shark pads and launder just as well. There are slight stylistic differences to the Shark pads but work just as well. They're also priced at a much better value than Shark's own pads. We ended up buying a second package in addition to this evaluation package to allow us to routinely do the kitchen and breakfast nook that is constantly needing touchups from dropped food (and resultant dog slobber) and muddy dog paws.Excellent item.",
