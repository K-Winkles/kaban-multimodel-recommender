                "reviewText": "I've never had any need for a handheld steamer until I discovered my indoor cats had picked up fleas. To my utter and complete horror, fleas had infiltrated the upstairs of my home. After trying various insecticides, laying down diatomaceous earth powder, setting flea traps, I eventually decided that I had had enough of taking a passive approach to eliminating them - I wanted to seek and destroy. And so, I purchased this handheld steamer/steam cleaner.I believe it is pretty straightforward and simple to use. Unfortunately, you cannot press down the trigger at will to shoot out steam. There is a push-down safety tab which locks the steamer in the 'on' position until you are ready to stop steaming. Then you would press down on the safety tab again to release. The temp and air pressure at which it dispenses steam is very effective for completely disintegrating fleas, eggs, larvae...where ever they may be hiding. It has a fairly large reservoir for water. It is able to steam clean all around the borders of a smallish room (~100 square feet) without having to reload. It comes with every attachment you may ever need. I also thought the design was way sleeker than anything else I had come across on the market.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My family recently moved into an older home and needless to say there was a lot of cleaning and preparation to get it in a clean and livable state for our family. This steamer helped us so much. We were able to get most of the tough stains in the grout and window seals without the use of harsh chemicals and cleaners. It made cleaning so simple and easy. I just ran the steamer, which also blasted out all of the tough to get edges, and went behind with a dry rag to wipe up the debris. Super simple and super effective. It also heats up in less than 30 seconds which made refilling and getting back to cleaning quick and easy. I always grab this first now and have found myself hardly using any cleaning products. I have also used to to lift stickers, I have a toddler, off of places that would otherwise leave marks and residue. It makes it super easy. I am able to steam my clothes instead of pulling out my iron. It also has many attachments that make the job much easier. It is my new favorite cleaning device. I highly recommend. It does spit a small amount of water while the steam is coming to temp but it resolves in about ten seconds once the steam is flowing.",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this steamer. We had heard of the steam cleaners by word of mouth. The word was - steam cleaners are a cleaning dynamo. How true. Based on what people were telling us and the reviews on Amazon we decided to buy one. The selection of steamers is quite large so how did we pick this one. It was the longer cord and greater water capacity.I would guess the steamer has been used for over twenty hours now as we do grout, faucets, slate and glass. Sometimes the simplest things make a big difference in your life. Like a vacuum everyone should have a steam cleaner. This SXHY has been a great purchase. If feels safe, has numerous attachments and work consistently each time. I am sure all steam cleaners produce a steam cleaning action, it is basic in concept, but the longer cord and capacity are the buying standouts. When home the best thing is the consistent and the attachments that look to be quite durable. This item is a household utensil everyone should have.It is the season and rain and wind, come spring I will put it to use on bikes, cars and even outside item. The only downside is when one notices that the steam cleaner really cleans things that appeared to be quite clean. The unit is worth it just to clean the stove, oven and other kitchen appliances.",

I felt they were actually clean...no soap residue...which I hate! I used the soft pipe (the long hose attachment) the window brush & the ironing towel on the tiles. I also sanitized my toilet. I cleaned all the attachments after with just soap and water...very easy to clean up. After I dried my ironing towel I wanted to see if it would take the wrinkles out of my curtain as you can see.. it did! I will be using this a lot...it does a wonderful job and is easy to go from one thing to the next.",
