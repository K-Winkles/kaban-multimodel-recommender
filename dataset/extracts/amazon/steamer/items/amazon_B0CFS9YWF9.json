                "reviewText": "I gave my shot because I was really attracted by its appearance and description. And so great that it even exceeded my expectation. The steam is so intensive and strong. The ironing panel surface is large and flat. So the iron result is so good that I have to leave my recommandation here. It has a large water tank and it's built-out so you can easily see how much water is left! And again, it looks so great overall and in detail too! It's nice designed!after 3 months of consistent using, it\u2019s still working great. I attached some pictures to see the effect after ironing. Wrinkles are all gone and the quality still perfect after months",
