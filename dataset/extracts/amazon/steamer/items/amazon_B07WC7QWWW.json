                "reviewText": "My mother has been sewing most of her 72 years and she has sworn by Rowenta. So when I went in search for a steamer of this size I looked for over a month. I read reviews and for some reason this one on Amazon has a bad rap. Well I\u2019ve never personally owned a large steamer, but I\u2019ve worked years in the retail industry using a professional one. This was not difficult at all to put together. If you can put together IKEA furniture, then this is simple. I was skeptical about the amount of water it holds, thought I would have to keep refilling it. I do resale online clothing so when I need it the most, it\u2019s usually me steaming for a couple of hours, so I just keep a pitcher of water next to me and keep filling as I go, never had I ran out of water. It works great! I even bought a \u201cused\u201d one, it was actually brand new, came in it\u2019s original packaging and Amazon shipped in another box to protect it. I love that I noLonger need an ironing board and a steamer. I don\u2019t have much space to work in so this is perfect. I read the reviews on this on the Rowenta website and it had rave reviews. We\u2019ve always had a Rowenta iron, and the one we have is 20 years old and still working great. I hope this steamer provides me with the long lasting love that our iron has. Also if I just need to steam one item to wear, I just press the on button, go about doing what ever I am doing and when I hear it with a couple minutes I\u2019ll take care of my garment. It automatically shuts off with out use. And the best is you can use regular tap water. The base is extremely sturdy, was a bit heavy, but since it\u2019s the base and the steamer is movable with a handle it doesn\u2019t make any difference. Since it doesn\u2019t hold a large amount of water, the steamer itself would be great for doing curtains or anything you would have to hold it for if you needed to, since it\u2019s pretty light weight. Plus! Rowenta has its own website, so if you want to add on, or replace anything you can. Like the filter, I live in a region of the US that doesn\u2019t have the best water. I also was able to register my steamer with Rowenta in case of anything was to happen. It does come with a brush attachment, I don\u2019t see or didn\u2019t even really look or read for a place on the steamer to store it. But I keep it in my desk. What\u2019s one piece?I primarily bought this specific one because of its brand and the black and gold color, it matches my bedroom attire. But it has really exceeded my expectations. No buttons to figure out what you need it for, I\u2019ve used it on every type of material so far, and no problems. No dripping. Or leaving water spots on my clothing. I\u2019m truly happy I went with this steamer.My personal favorite extra about this steamer is maneuverability! Since I steam for hours at a time I can sit in any chair I want, and I\u2019m able to change the height to my needs, and move the board to different levels very easily.",
