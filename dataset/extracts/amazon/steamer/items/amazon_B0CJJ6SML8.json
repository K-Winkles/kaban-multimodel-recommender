                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have some more delicate blouses and things that I prefer to avoid ironing\u2013and sometimes in general I just prefer not to have to pull out my ironing board, so I thought it was about time to try out a fabric steamer and ordered this one.The steamer is a conveniently small size, and has a nice long electrical cord (about 91 inches according to my measurements). There is a gasket in the nozzle, and they\u2019ve also included an extra gasket in case the first one wears out. It\u2019s easy to fill since you just have to unlock the spout at the top and pour the water in. It\u2019s also really lightweight so it shouldn\u2019t be burdensome to add to my luggage, though of course its shape might prove a little awkward.For my first test I steamed a blouse that I made the mistake of storing folded in my dresser, which left it very wrinkly. I used distilled water to avoid any risk of mineral deposits steaming onto my clothes. The on/off switch is right on the handle and it started steaming pretty quickly after turning it on. The steam was very effective at removing the wrinkles from my clothes. I\u2019ve included a video of the process and the only issue I ran into was because I had it hanging off the back of my office chair; I hit an area where part of the chair sticks out and it prevented the steam from doing its magic. Otherwise, I didn\u2019t have to do anything but run the steamer nozzle over the fabric and the wrinkles relaxed right out.I didn\u2019t quite fill the reservoir and ended up having just enough water to fully unwrinkle my blouse. I imagine future uses might prove to be a little faster since I won\u2019t be trying to film it at the same time and I\u2019ll have a better idea of what to do.Bear in mind that since this is steam, you will need to let the nozzle cool off before you try to remove it if you need to refill it. If you want to be able to work continuously on a large number of items you might want to look for something with a higher capacity. If you need something that can do furniture and clothes steaming you\u2019ll probably need something that\u2019s more specifically designed for that, both because this one needs to be held at specific angles and is only designed to hold a relatively small amount of water.This will be helpful to have on hand for when I have just one thing I need to freshen up before wearing. Where it will be safe to do so I may experiment with trying to lift stains from certain things as well (bearing in mind that the steamer shouldn\u2019t be held at more than a 45 degree angle). Since it\u2019s so nice and small, I could also see myself packing this for trips within the US so that I can freshen up my clothes after getting them out of a suitcase or duffel bag.",

                "reviewText": "I primarily use a large standing steamer for my clothes, but it's so big and bulky that I wanted an alternative for shirts that just need a quick touch up from being too tightly wedged against something else in the closet. This works really well for that. It heated up in a little over a minute and I was able to quickly steam out a few stray wrinkles from a shirt that came out of the dryer less than smooth. I did find I had to be very careful about keeping it moving. Unlike my large steamer I could not start at the top and work down in straight lines as the design for the steam holes left clear marks down the shirt if you got too close. I basically traded unorganized wrinkles for very organized ones. I found working in a circular motion and moving constantly worked best but it also slowed down the process a bit and is counter intuitive to how you want to work from side to side. Overall you get what you pay for and after getting the technique down it will be fine for a quick job. It is small enough to easily travel with as well. It is going to be rough if you have a bigger surface area to cover or more set in wrinkles but if you keep in mind it is not really designed for heavy lifting jobs then it's a good option.",

                "reviewText": "I had my doubts whether this product would deliver, but it did. Getting started is easy:Unscrew the topFill with water to the max lineScrew but onTurn onWait about 1 minute until the water is boiling and steam begins to pour out of the spoutNote that one will have to keep the product plugged in while using it, but the cord is long enough to allow working standing up and moving back and forth.I had a few clothes I wear to the office I needed to unwrinkle and the little steamer worked well for over an hour.With the size of this product being fairly small, it gets about 1 piece completed. Then one has to refill the water.I used an oven mit to unscrew the top of the steamer in between garments because the top gets very warm and I did not want to risk burning my hands.I think my working with this product for about an hour uninterrupted gave it a pretty good stress test and proved that it can hold up to longer jobs.Granted, I got a bit irritated that I had to refill the product several times, but with the size being more of a \u201ctravel\u201d steamer, I am not deducting starts for that.The product did a fantastic job getting the wrinkles out and is very easy to use. I recommend this for anybody who wants an affordable garment steamer.",

                "reviewText": "I am really enjoying this steamer. It is small, compact, easy to use, and quick to set up. I like that you can fill it up with water and within minutes have it working. It takes up less space than setting up an ironing board and a traditional iron. Each fill of the steamer does one to two garments depending how wrinkled they are. Perfect size to take with you when traveling. I agree with other reviewers that you need to be careful taking the top off or putting you hand near the steam holes. I would recommend getting a hand mitt to protect your fingers.",
