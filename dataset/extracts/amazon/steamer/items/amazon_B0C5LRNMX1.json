Suitable for countries such as the USA, Mexico, Japan, etc. But not suitable for countries in the Europe area. Can I add a plug adapter to use this product in a 220V country? Unfortunately, plug adapters cannot change the voltage, so this is not possible. What should I pay attention to during use? 1. Ensure the product is not directed towards anyone or objects; 2. Place the product in a safe area and wait for it to heat up or cool down. Can I install the brush accessories while using the product? No, it's not recommended. The nozzle panel gets very hot during use, and installing the brush attachment could lead to burns. It's safe to install the attachment only before heating or after cooling down. What should I do if my Steamer has no steam push on? If no steam, check water level, clear nozzle blockages, ensure power connection, allow preheating, and verify settings. Regular descaling helps. If unresolved, see manual or contact support.",
