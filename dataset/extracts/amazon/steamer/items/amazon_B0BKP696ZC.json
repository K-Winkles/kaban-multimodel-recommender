I love that where the steam comes out has flat area that can be used as a mini iron on particularly tough wrinkles.

I find that it heats up and cools down pretty quickly, the only thing that would make this better is if it had something to hold it up while not in use instead of having to lay it down sideways.",

When it heats up has a funky smell (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because of the heat). Something that I\u2019m concerned is the voltage limit on the booklet. It said over 120 voltage can be dangerous but I don\u2019t even know what that means. Then how do they expect me to know when it stays within the recommended voltage. There should be some sort of instructions explaining how we can understand when it goes over 120 voltage. Also the book should contain info on how long can the steamer be on so we can be cautions while in use.",

                "reviewText": "I love this product. I just hope it'll keep working for a while. My old steamer just died after a year. I hope this one lasts longer than that. Will update.I love how you have to press the button while steaming because I feel like you don't waste a lot of water. I get to control when the steam starts and when to stop. It is pretty powerful and heats up literally in seconds. I also like the detachable water reservoir. I love that it is shaped like a blow dryer. The size is good. Foldability is also a plus. However, I don't like that it is a challenge when you wanna set it down (like let say you just wanna straighten the clothes briefly), there is nothing to hold it up. Coz I don't like the hot part touching a surface and eventually burning it. Nothing that a small wash cloth/towel can do, but it's just something to think about. It hasn't happened yet. But overall, this steamer gets an A!PS: took this on a cruise ship. As you know steamers are not allowed on cruise ships. But because this looks like a blow dryer (on x-ray machine), it was not confiscated. I did not use it on the cruise (for safety reasons obvi) but was surprised at the number of steamers I saw that were kept at the port and returned to the passengers at the end of the cruise. Not encouraging people to bring steamers on a cruise ship but if you have to, this will probably be your best choice. Not only because it is easy to sneak in (lol) coz it looks like a blow dryer, but also because you won't have to worry about leaving it on because it doesn't steam unless you press the button.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a steamer for a vacation, plus an extra requirement for this to look like a hair dryer in checked luggage (...) and this worked great.Seeing many reviews mentioning low water capacity and others about unit failures, it doesn't take a genious to figure out you shouldn't let this thing run out of water while you're using it. Fill it with water and press + hold the button. Don't let off. On a cold start it may spit water at first. Point it away for 30 seconds or so. Then it works great. It uses half a tank of water for shirts, full tank for suits and full length dresses. And yes stop and refill when it's less than half full or so. No problems. Works fast.This unit needs 120 volts and uses 1000 watts. That means don't try using this for 200v outlets and don't ask about using voltage converters ... for a 1kw appliance! A 1kw voltage converter would be large, heavy, and expensive. If you will have 200v where you are going, please consider buying a 200v unit.Btw I'm switching to this for work trips in the US (120v everywhere here). So much faster than ironing.",
