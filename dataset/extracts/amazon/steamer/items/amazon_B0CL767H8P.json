                "reviewText": "I ordered these steam mop replacement pads and have been impressed with their quality.I received 4 pad in the package - 2 scrubby pads and 2 regular pads. All 4 came bundled together in a vacuum sealed bag. The product said \"Made in China\"I own a Bissell 2685a steam mop and it came with only scrubby pads.Comparing the OEM scrubby pad to this pad, the Bissell scrubby pad weighs 77g and these replacement pads weigh 72g each. So they are a little bit lighter and feel slightly thinner. I did not see any difference in performance though. Both the Bissell pads and these pads worked great.The 2 regular mop pads weighed 54g each. I had no issues using them and they performed well. I didn't have any non-scrubby Bissell pads to compare these too.One difference in construction is on the Bissell pad, the tag is in the back. On these products, the tag is in the front. I think the tags are used to help remove the pad from the mop head and worked well. One caveat is that the tag on these replacement heads is smaller and I had to make sure it is exposed so I could grab it.All of these pads fit my Bissell 2685a mop head with no issues and I\u2019d recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "Upon receiving a set of four, I examined each steam mop pad. Each pad featured elastic around the circular portion, while the straight side lacked this feature. These pads flawlessly fit my steam mop. Installing them was a breeze, and once in place, they securely stayed put during use. The pads also proved to be easily rinsed out. I was pleased with their performance, as they efficiently tackled the task of cleaning my hardwood floors. Although the process of mopping and waxing can be laborious, the steam mop, aided by these pads, made the job more manageable.The only downside, if it can be called that, is that the efficient cleaning prowess of the steam mop and these pads leaves me with little motivation to complete the once-daunting task of mopping and waxing.Good item and a recommended choice.",

                "reviewText": "Wasn't really expecting much from these, but I was impressed. These fit so much better than the original ones that came with my Bissell Mop steamer. The original ones, I felt I had to really stretch to get around the edges and corners of the bottom of it but these fit on with no problem and I had no issues with them being too big or saggy either. These do a really good job of absorbing a lot of dirt. They are washable and made of excellent quality as I didn't have any problems with the seams or stitching coming apart. Overall wonderful replacements for your steamer mop.",

                "reviewText": "I am still rating this a 5 star item since it offers 10 in a pack that you can do a lot of mopping without having to wash every other pads because you only have two pairs. This way, you can continuously mop without being interrupted with washing the other ones but instead you can wash them all at the same time and be done with the mopping. At least 12 pairs is enough for my needs and more effective use of my time. I didn\u2019t have to wait for other rags to be dirty so I could put them all in the wash at the same time. The quality may be less than the original microfiber but it still cleans the same way.",

I honestly didn\u2019t realize how dirty my original pads were until I received these replacements \u2013 see side-by-side photo comparison. And I had washed the old pads every time I used them, but they are several years old so new ones were overdue.This set contains two each of the two types of pads that originally came with my Bissell model 1940-1 steam mop. Once pad is slightly thicker and is for more textured floors such as the tile I have in my kitchen. The other is thinner and more appropriate (at a lower steam setting) for wood floors.When I first opened the package, I thought there was a sizing problem \u2013 again, see the side-by-side photo, but it just turns out that the elastic on my old pads had stretched considerably. These new ones fit much tighter and more like they are supposed to.They have a small pouch on the inside where you can put a fragrance puck, though I don\u2019t use those.I did a quick job on my kitchen floor and even though it had been done not that long ago, the pad did pick up some additional dirt. The steam seems to go through the pad well and it picks up, rather than spreads around stains on the floor. As with any steam mop, the floor should be well vacuumed first.",
