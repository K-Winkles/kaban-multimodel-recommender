                "reviewText": "This handheld steamer works as described, and is good for steaming a few items at a time. It heated up super quick, and was ready to use within a minute or so. I steamed a few pieces of clothing with this, and it worked well at removing wrinkles, but the shape and way the steam comes out made me need to put it really right next to the fabric for it to work. I think one shirt that had sewed in pleats got damaged/the threading to hold the pleats melted or got too loose from the steam, unfortunately. It comes with a nice storage bag and a cord wrap for organization. A downside is that it's really hard to get all the water out of the water reservoir when you're done, based on the shape of that piece, so I put it away with that piece detached (in the bag provided), but it was still wet when I pulled it out a week later. This is unfortunate, as I don't want it to get gross or moldy!",
