                "reviewText": "So I love the container part that holds water. It comes with like this funnel cup that makes it easy to refill. The things I don\u2019t like about it is that the button for the steamer for me is not a good spot. So when you double click that button, it will go to a continuous steam wish is great so you don\u2019t have to hold the bottom. But your finger ends up, pushing the button again and ending the continuous steam because of the steamer being top-heavy, you tend to hold it more towards the top of the steamer handle. You probably can just hold it more on the bottom, but that was harder for my hands. The steam that comes out looks pretty good but I find myself taking a long time to steam one garment so I think the heat isn\u2019t as high as it should be. I also think the heat isn\u2019t as strong because I find myself having to almost put the steamer completely on the garment, almost like to iron it.Also, it\u2019s starting to make a ticking noise the water cup is full. I use distilled water but the ticking noises a little annoying. If the ticking noise gets worse, I\u2019m going to definitely buy another steamer.",
