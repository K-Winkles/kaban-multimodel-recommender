                "reviewText": "This little thing works great and holds a good amount of water too! The con is the size, it's a bit bulky for traveling. I use this at home though and the size for at-home use is perfect. The top piece comes off to make it more compact and you get attachments that are useful. It's a medium size versus compact so you can take it along with you while traveling, but think of it being the same size as a full size hair dryer. This works well and fast at taking out the wrinkles though so it does exactly what it says its going to do. Good steam output and heats up fast. It's a great product.",

                "reviewText": "This steamer came on time. It was nicely packaged and came with all pieces in brand new, perfect condition. I do not like to iron so I bought this to replace ironing. This product is awesome and it does a great job of getting wrinkles out of clothing and curtains, and any other type of products like that. I\u2019ve had some clothes that were pretty wrinkled, and I put them on a hanger. Turn this on and get the wrinkles out very nicely. I was shocked at how good this thing works. it\u2019s a small steamer. It has one button. Basically you fill the steamer up to your desired amount with water. Then you plug it in and turn on the orange button. There is only one button and I usually wait till I see steam coming out of the top. All I do is run the steamer along with the clothes and it works well. I go over it a few times and you do not have to touch the clothing with the steamer, it has an attachment that has a brush you can use as well. It also has a little cup that you can use to fill it up with. It\u2019s small enough that you could bring it with you on trips or vacations to get the wrinkles out of your clothes that were in a suitcase. I really like this steamer. It was a great price and I highly recommend. This can definitely replace ironing!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s easy to use, fill and the cord is long which is helpful in my closet. However, to use this steamer, you have to stay on task as it heats up very quickly. You\u2019ll see the steam start as soon as the heating up noise quiets down a bit. You\u2019ll see the water boiling in the bottle. My issue with it is that it wets the clothes far too quickly. If you\u2019re steaming something you\u2019re going to wear soon, make sure you have time to let the wet spots dry. The steamer starts spewing water within just a couple mins after you start seeing the steam come out so you have to operate quickly. I couldn\u2019t get past my dress to do my husband\u2019s shirt because of how much water was coming out. I had to turn it off let it cool for a few mins and then start it back up, but even then it still spewed some water on his shirt. i had to let it dry so that he didn\u2019t walk out with water spots on his chest.",

                "reviewText": "I never thought I'd see such a difference between this hand held steamer and the iron!What takes around 10 minutes for wrinkled clothes, I'm able to do it in under 2-3 minutes max. And it is still shocking for me in a good way.Although it is portable and easy to use, i feel that there are some things to take note of:1. One should be very careful with the high heated steam while using it2. Although a lot of people have mentioned it as lightweight, it becomes a little straining in the hand when you do it for more than 10 minutes straight3. Little inconvenient when it comes to being safe and doing it right for shirts especially but ultimately with some struggle, gets my job done.4. The water capacity is only enough for like 2- 3 shirts max. You gotta wait until it cools down to refill the water.I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for on-the-fly ironing :)",
