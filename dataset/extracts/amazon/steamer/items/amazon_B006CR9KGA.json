                "reviewText": "I waited a little to write this review since I wanted to have used it for a while to see if I really liked it. I had used the conair turbo extreme steam before, the one that now costs around $70-$80 bucks, and was thinking of purchasing it again but we had bought it for around $40 just a few years ago, also I didnt want a normal iron since it would involve buying and taking up storage space for an ironing board too, so I continued to search and read a ton of reviews on several steamers when we stumbled upon this one on sale for $26, I am SO glad we made this purchase.It works just as good, heats up in minutes, puts out more than enough steam at a good temperature, wrinkles just dissapear on all kinds of clothing, it holds about the same water, and its not heavy to hold at all, I dont mind that it doesnt stand upright by itself since I can lay it on its side when i need to turn a garment over or whatever, I loooove the feature that lets me have continous steam so no more hurting my fingers from pressing a button for a while when steaming several items.Its very easy to use and set up, I like that its lightweight, it has a tiny spout for the water but I find it pretty easy to fill and empty the reservoir, and takes up very little space when not in use, so far, very happy with the quality and overall use of this product, would recomend!",

                "reviewText": "This little steamer is much better than I expected. My husband is a professional window treatment installer and he uses commercial grade steamers to remove wrinkles on fabric all the time. We have one at home to steam garments/shades and sanitize surfaces around the house, but it's big and heavy and not practical for small jobs. I needed something small to quickly steam a shirt or pair or pants that came out a bit wrinkled from the dryer. I have this little guy right next to my dryer in the laundry closet and in just a minute, I can steam any garment to perfection. The steamer works just as wells as the full size unit and even with cool extra features. The steam comes out quickly and it doesn't spit out or spill hot water like the big one does. I can turn it around in any direction and it doesn't spill. I love that you have the choice to have continuous steam (locked) or only when you push the trigger (unlocked) It also has two temperature levels (low/high) which is handy if you need to steam delicate fabrics like silk. It comes with three attachments that I find very useful: A clip on crease maker, a mini-brush and a lint remover.I also use it to clean up anything that needs to be disinfected like bathroom and kitchen countertops, doorknobs, faucets, etc. I even removed nasty baked on grease from my stove's burners by steaming them for a few seconds and then wiping with a dry paper towel! It is not magic though, there are some things that will stay, but 90-95% will just melt away and that's good enough for me.The only con is that it doesn't come with a wall mount, clip, bracket or anything like that. And it is a bit heavy and unbalanced and likely to fall down and break to pieces if left on top of a table or shelf.However, I am still very satisfied with my purchase, I would really recommend it to anyone who is a neat freak and wants to save some money on dry cleaning. And I am getting another one for my mom.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer in 2017 and it recently stopped making steam so I came back here to get another one. I saw a review that said to try descaling it and wow it works great again! Super easy.. I just used distilled vinegar in the water tank and steamed it all out, then put distilled water to clear that and it works just as well as day one. So if anyone else is like me and needs a reminder to try cleaning/fixing things before sending them to landfill this one\u2019s for you",

Decid\u00ed compararla, adem\u00e1s de que ten\u00eda buenos reviews, porque vi que ten\u00eda la opci\u00f3n de poner un candado a la opci\u00f3n de vapor sin necesidad de tener que oprimir el bot\u00f3n todo el tiempo mientras planchas, eso facilita much\u00edsimo la tarea y hace que no sea cansado. Si planchas una prenda dif\u00edcil de planchar, es probable que el agua que colocas para el vapor s\u00f3lo te alcance para esa prenda pero es muy f\u00e1cil rellenar el contrenedor y para nada se derrama sobre la ropa mientras planchas.",
