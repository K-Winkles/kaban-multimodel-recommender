The reservoir holds enough water to steam about two men\u2019s dress shirts and then I need to fill it up again. It heats up so fast\u2013in under a minute\u2013so I really don\u2019t mind.There are still certain items I want to take the time to iron by hand but for everything else, this works well.

                "reviewText": "I've read the other reviews, and heeded the warnings. Do NOT overfill the unit. This takes a few minutes to generate the steam, and is very simple to operate. From the attached photos, a before and after on a T-shirt. They recommend distilled water, so grab a bottle on your next grocery trip. My take on this, is that if you have a single garment to de-wrinkle, this is a good tool to use without pulling out an ironing board, and setting up an iron. However, if you have multiple garments, this is not what I would use. It takes longer to steam than it would to iron, but it's convenient for one garment. It comes with a fill cup, and you pour it into the top opening, twist on the steam head, attach the brush tool, and steam away. It also has a storage bag to store it. For travel, it's an OK size, so you'd have to make room for it, and just use tap water. It took an entire fill line worth of water to de-wrinkle a single T-shirt. It does its job well enough, and should come in handy when needed. I was a bit disappointed in the delivery though, as it was not packaged at all, just a shipping label pasted to the manufacturer's box, like it just came off the shelf at the store. It didn't get any damage during shipping, but that doesn't mean it won't if they ship it that way to you.",
