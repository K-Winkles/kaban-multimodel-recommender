                "reviewText": "Absolutely amazing!I always had a hard time cleaning with swiffer wet +dry . I had to change the pad several times when it gets dry or dirty. But this steamer is now my life changer . It fell many times bc of my baby but nothing was broken. Design is beautiful especially when you love pink color. With one mop, I clean living room and kitchen and I changed it to a new one for bedroom. You can machine wash and dry. I will order more mop so I can clean more. Cleaning is fun now!",
