                "reviewText": "The steamer is truly exceptional! Despite claiming to heat up in 20 sec, it actually takes about 5, which is a game-changer for someone like me with limited time in the morning. I appreciate the rotating handle, offering added convenience. Whether I'm steaming vertically or horizontally, it performs exceptionally well. The steamer's build is sturdy, and the most important, it doesn't spit water, leaving my clothes neither damp nor wet.Its lightweight and compact design make it perfect for travel. I've tried various small steamers, including expensive ones, and this one surpasses them all. I specifically sought a compact option to save space, and this steamer fulfills my need for quick steaming.The downside is that you can't visually check the water level, but it's not a big issue as you'll hear when it's out of water, and refilling doesn't waste time thanks to its quick heating. The steamer includes a robust pad for resting it while dealing with garments. Although I turn it off when placing it on the pad, it's a minor step since it heats up instantly when you press the button again.",
