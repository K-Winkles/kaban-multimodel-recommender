                "reviewText": "No, I am not an expert in fabric steamers, or even good at basic ironing.I bought this as a gift for my wife several years ago. She asked for a basic little hand-steamer that was advertised on TV. I looked it up and saw the horrendous reviews, decided that with the good reviews on this one, maybe it would be worth the extra money. Not only was I right, it has exceeded our expectations.This thing is built solid. Everything about it says quality. Nothing has ever failed or broken. No parts need replacing, no filters need changing.You do have to lift the solidly-made plastic water container out of the unit and fill it up with water every now and then (actually not that often, unless you use this thing for literally hours every day I guess). But for a daily touch-up of a shirt or dress, the water lasts a long time without refilling. Its easy to do, too. You lift the big contoured black handle, pull it straight up and out, go to the sink, unscrew the lid, fill it up with tap water, screw it back and put it back in. There is even a little handle on the bottom side to hold it while you are filling it with water--they thought this thing out well! No mess or spills either. Nothing has ever leaked.Yea, it does look a little dated and utilitarian. Who cares? It sits at the ready in the corner behind our refrigerator. You roll it out on the smooth caster wheels, flip the big switch which lights up a pleasing soft green when on, and in seconds you hear a gurgling sound and steam is pumping out of the wand, ready to get to work. The big switch can be easily turned on with your foot without even stooping if you want!The solid aluminum metal clothes hanger holds your garment securely. Just leave the clothes on a hanger, hang it on the rod, and sweep the wand around the fabric to get wrinkles out.No pulling out the squeaky ironing board, setting up a iron, no burning of clothes. Yep, you can burn your skin a little with the very hot steam from the wand if you are lazy and not paying attention--I did it a few times when I started using it, not anymore. Just be careful.Look, I'm a guy. I don't like to iron clothes, or even steam them. But this thing works so easily and takes so little time, I just try to listen to my wife when she tells me I need to iron my shirt. Frankly, this gift keeps on giving for years. She loves it, I love it. It makes us both happy when we use it! ;)Wrinkles fade out like magic when you use it. It actually works, it's easy to do, even kinda fun. It makes me feel good when I use it, cause it makes my wife happy. Seriously, that is worth its weight in gold, isn't it?As the label proudly states, it is made in the USA.Did I mention how easy it is to set this thing up out of the box? A little kid could do it (probably better than us).I've reviewed a lot of other stuff, but for some reason forgot to review this Original Jiffy Steamer when I got it, years ago. If I could give this product 10 stars, I would. There is nothing not to like about it.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for us guys who now do the laundry. Following a few swear words, mishaps and ups and downs with the ironing board and iron I saw the \"little steamer\" advertised. This looked like my salvation, so I ordered the little rascal. It worked surprisingly great and the ironing board found its way into the basement (the steam iron is still up on a shelf in the laundry room.) Recently my little steamer started spurting hot water and steam all over, so was time to regroup and read all the internet reviews about steam pressing.I ordered the \"Jiffy Steamer J-2000 Residential Series 1300-Watt Garment Steamer from Amazon.com. I had my four pair of golf shorts and 4 polo shirts, from my four days of golf, available when the steamer arrived. I filled the water container with distilled water, turned it on and in less time than my little steamer was perking, steam was pumping out, and no spurting of hot steam water. My shorts and shirts were on hanger's right out of the dryer, so ready for the chore of pressing out wrinkles and folds, but hold on, this was actually fun and no chore. The wrinkles seemed to melt away with all the hot steam and each shirt was done in about 2 minutes. I had the shorts hung by the waist band so was simple to steam out any wrinkles and looked better than my ironing used to look. My \"ironing\" duties were completed in less than 30 minutes.Now the question for you guys who also have the ironing duties, would you rather spend more time on the golf course or in the laundry room? Also, as I said before, it is actually enjoyable to see the results in a short period of time and \"no hassles\" with an ironing board, lol.For the new-comers, yes, the little steamer works great, but would I switch back? - can I drive the ball 300 yards? - Answer is no. The occassional spurting of hot water from the little steamer was of course a nuisance, but tolerable, and naturally it could not be turned upside down. I now steam clothing from the inside, both the shirts and pants. With the legs hanging down it is easy to insert the steam nozzle and run it up and down. I might add this nozzle gets very hot, so be cautious. Also, the max for the little steamer was about 20 or 30 minutes and with my Jiffy Steamer, an hour is no problem.I might add I am 82 years of age, so you young'uns should easily outperform me. I steamed our mattress last week, so bye-bye any bedbugs. Feel like getting on the good side of your \"significant other\"? - steam some of her clothes and put a smile on her face (I now also steam my wife's PJ's so she looks gorgeous morning, noon and night.)So there you have it guys, would you rather sweat and swear over the ironing board, or sing along with your favorite CD. Also have extra time now on the golf course, wearing wrinkle-free golf clothes? Oh, would I recommend this Jiffy steamer? - as we say out here - \"Yes, yes, yes, in a NY second.\" Jiffy Steamer J-2000 Residential Series 1300-Watt Garment Steamer",

So impressed with the quality, the stability, the fast response, the cute pink color and the overall brilliance of this product. GOODBYE irons. This is the way to go. It is expensive but not considering the quality and how quickly it works and how well it works. HIGHLY recommend and to all the skeptics out there - I cannot vouch for all steamers but I can vouch for this one. It is glorious. I keep mine ready to go in the spare room and it is cute as a button too. So glad I followed my research and bought a quality product right off the bat rather than buying and failing with cheaper steamers first. Amazon also gave awesome delivery service.",
