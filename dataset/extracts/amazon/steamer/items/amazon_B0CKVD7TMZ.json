I put it to the test on two tough jobs: my shower and my oven door (using separate cleaning heads, of course!). In both cases, the KOITAT delivered!As you can see in my attached video, the steam output is strong and continuous, making quick work of grime and grease. My shower tiles are sparkling again, and the oven door looks brand new \u2013 no harsh chemicals needed!Overall, I'm highly satisfied with the KOITAT. It's powerful, easy to use, and tackles a wide range of cleaning tasks. If you're looking for a versatile and effective steam cleaner, I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Just got this steam cleaner today and used it on our very dirty oven first. It makes it SO much easier to get hard dried on stains off so that you don\u2019t have to scrape and scrub for a long time. I used the hose attachment and the scrubbing head in the video. It is fairly loud when operating.While it was very effective and satisfying to see how easily the steam washes off hard dried on stains, it was very tiring! You have to hold the steam cleaner with one hand and push the button up and knob down with your thumb. After a while, this is very uncomfortable for your thumb. I think this is a child safety feature, but I would be so much happier with it if I could just switch it on without having to hold down the button the whole time. Still, I would purchase it again because it was so powerful at removing stains! I used it to quickly clean and wipe off the kitchen mats too, and it was perfect for this too.",

I\u2019ve been using it all over my apartment since I got it, next up is grout and carpets. So far I\u2019ve used it on windows, baseboards, air conditioner, shower, faucets and they\u2019ve all come out fantastic. I definitely wish I bought one of these sooner.Also to be noted, I usually do a quick clean everyday and then on weekends do a deep clean. Adding this to your weekly deep clean is sure to give your home that fresh and clean \u201cnew\u201d feeling.

                "reviewText": "Got this product for getting into those hard to get places and jetting away engrained dirt from grouting and int he hard to clean corners of the kitchen and for cleaning the ovenI was really pleased to find that the steamer is really straight forward to use and comes with loads of different attachments making it really versatile. Its heats up really quickly (within a few minutes) making it useful in no time at all. If I could criticise one thing, and that is that the water tank isn't transparent so you cant tell how much steaming time you have left. Typically not a big issue (especially given the price) but would make a positive different if the design were changed in future. If it wasn't for this, it would have got a straight 5 stars. Nice product.",
