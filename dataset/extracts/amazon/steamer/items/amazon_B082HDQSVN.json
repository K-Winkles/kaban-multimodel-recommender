                "reviewText": "Pros:- Super portable. Same size as my hair straightening iron (which is the pink one on the comparison photo).- Has a steamer button that you hold down to release the steam, unlike some steamers that have no button- It works, unlike many so-called portable steamerCons:- Due to its portable size, you need to refill the water well if doing more than 3 shirts- Takes a little longer, due to its smaller size- The water well is hard to see, due to the red color of the windowOverall, it works.2 things to note:1. I took a pic of the door to the water refill compartment to show you how fragile it is. If it breaks off, you\u2019ll need to buy a new steamer, since that door is what keeps the water contained.2. As with any portable steamer, you\u2019re sacrificing size for efficacy. If you expect to steam your clothes quickly, then buy a full sized steamer. If you expect crisp creases as with an iron, then buy an iron, lol.I included pics of a button-down shirt and a silk tank top to show how the finished product using this steamer will look. Overall, I\u2019m happy with it, since portability was my main objective. I definitely would not use this overseas since the intense voltage will blow out any converter, rendering this useless.",

Other steamers work for a few months, then take forever to heat and are constantly in a cycle of boiling water. This is easy and ready to use. The resevput may be smaller than some, but the fact that you get consistent steam makes it easy to overlook the size of the resevoir. I can usually get 3-5 garments steamed before refilling. It cools down nicely as well. As far as space goes, it's compact and I live how the shape makes it easy to pack things around. I say purchase it and give it a chance.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Hamilton Beach's warranty is about as worthless as expected. When I reached out to them in September they told me they are out of stock and could not ship me a replacement. They would not refund me either. They only offered me a credit against a different CHI Steam (aka Hamilton Beach) product which is a joke because all their other products are irons and more expensive.They told me to check back in 6-8 weeks to see if they had restocked. So I set a reminder on my calendar (it's the principle of the matter, doggone it.) It's now 6-8 weeks later and they still do not have it in stock.DO NOT BUY THIS STEAMER.***I had the same experience as many other people who bought this product; it worked the first time then broke. Unfortunately, I was right outside the Amazon return window so I contacted CHI to get a warranty replacement.CHI's customer service responded right away and informed me that this garment steamer is NOT manufactured by them. They license their name to Hamilton Beach (i.e., a mass produced budget appliance company). So I have to reach out to Hamilton Beach for the warranty and good luck to me.Be warned that this is not actually a CHI product with the quality you would expect. It's just the CHI name slapped on a lower-quality brand. You are taking your chances buying this.",

So annoying! Thankfully I tested it before packing for my trip! The return process was easy, and I was sent a replacement right away. I tested the replacement, and same thing happened. So disappointed! I will actually give it another try even though it\u2019s too lake for this trip now \u2026 but I am hopeful for this to work out and maybe the third time will be lucky. I\u2019ll update once I get the replacement of the replacement. \ud83e\udd23It\u2019s the most compact travel steamer I\u2019ve seen, which is why I\u2019m even bothering to try again.
