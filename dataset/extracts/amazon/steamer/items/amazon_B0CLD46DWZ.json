It's got a sleek design and its size allows it to be portable, so it's perfect to take with you when going on trips and your clothes get wrinkled in a suitcase. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quick and easy alternative to getting out pesky wrinkles without having to pull out a whole setup for ironing clothes!",

                "reviewText": "I like it because it takes almost no time at all to start up and begin using (within 30 seconds to 1 minute). I've never owned an iron or anything before now because I'm living in a very small space at the moment. I don't have the space for a full ironing board and I don't want to wait so long for it to warm up and be ready.I attached a before and after as I tried it out on one of my shirts. I did this one inside-out because it's a graphic tee and I wasn't sure if it would affect the quality of the image. No damage/harm to the shirt or graphic. Per the instructions, the steaming can be done on a garment while it's up on a hanger. I definitely have the space to work with it on a hanger, but I was being a little lazy, so I did this on my bed. All wrinkles gone in the second pic! (The camera captures it weirdly, but those folds on the second pic are just natural folds of the shirt/lighting.) I can only imagine the results would be 100% perfect if I actually did it from a hanger and not on my bed, haha.It's nice and convenient.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought the first model of this travel steamer years ago (2019 i believe) and being a frequent traveler with a bigger family now, decided to try this newer (and improved?) version after having a positive experience with the first. Overall, i think they\u2019re pretty similar with the main differences being size (this is slightly bigger) and heat up time (this is much faster).I like that the steamer is compact and convenient for keeping clothes wrinkle-free when traveling with limited space or on a budget.Easy set up allows for quick steaming and clean up. The ergonomic handle and generous power cord length (about 8 ft.) provides seamless movement and maneuverability which is great when you\u2019re in a rush to get out the door.My only issue (and i experienced the same with the original model as well as my regular-sized standing steamers from other brands) is sometimes water will drip out when tilted too far down, leaving clothes or carpet slightly damp and occasional hand burns if you're not careful.All in all, it\u2019s a great tool to have handy whether for travel or quick use at home and a good deal if looking for a reliable and budget-friendly steamer.",

At first glance, I can definitely tell that this product is larger than my previous steamer which will allow me to steam more items without having to stop and refill.The package comes with the steamer, a measuring cup, and a fabric brush that is indicated to help you \"brush\" out the wrinkles as you are steaming. I decided to try the steamer out on my shower curtain that was wrinkled from use to see how it would fare since that is a large surface. Immediately I could tell that it could produce steam a lot faster than my previous one, within maybe 15 seconds there was already steam coming out. Steaming-wise, I think it did okay however I feel that the original OG Hom steamer that I had purchased still reigns supreme in terms of performance, even if I need to wait a little bit longer and I think would be more convenient for travel since its smaller.",
