                "reviewText": "I recently moved into a new town home, two stories with hard tile floors throughout the entire first floor and hardwood floors all throughout the second floor and while I'm used to having wood floors and not having an issue, this is a bigger place for my husband and I and I wanted some extra help so when I saw the actual dual head scrubbing mop contraption that they managed to create. I had to jump at it and it's one of those products you have to actually use and try in order to appreciate fully beyond just the novelty of it.I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed with the actual machine itself. It works beautifully and it does the job that I need it to and cuts my time in more than half just by using it on a somewhat bi to tri weekly time frame just depending on how dirty things get.That said, having bought the mop you obviously need to buy the pads to replace or if you have dirty ones that you haven't washed yet, you need to clean set to continue your job and keep things in order. So I decided to give these a try because I found them at a great price and they look nearly identical.I will say once I got them home and open the package. They are not identical and actually I am happy they're not. The pads that I have that came with my mop have the sort of buffed cloth. Kind of side to it the way that these do as well but that's all. So essentially, while it works great, it's working in the same way. You would see one of those floor buffing/waxing machines that janitors use in the very big schools and things like that.Obviously you can tell I know the technical terms for all this stuff. So in my actual hands-on experience I have to say I love these pads that I purchased 10 times better because they have a selection of the buffs softer pads like the identical ones that come with the mop. But they also have an equal amount of pads that you can use that have a rougher almost bristle like consistency to it.These in particular are awesome at cleaning up those extra. Hard to get messes and stains that may appear. Not to get too graphic but I do have a cat and there are times that I mayAnd I see that she has thrown up previously and I was unable to catch it and these are the type of messes that go unnoticed and can be a little tougher to lift if you're just simply using a softer cloth to essentially steam n buff away the mess.So these pads are perfect for that because they're very versatile. You can clean the everyday easy stuff and have a quick run through your home and have it shine and you can whip them out in those times when you have the bigger messes that might require little elbow grease and all is clean, sanitary and sparkling in the end.Have to say I am very happy with the mop and I am extremely happy even more so that I found these particular pads and I highly recommend them if you own this specific model because you won't regret giving them a try.They're very durable and quality made. I've already run several through the wash a couple times and there's no shrinking or issue with falling apart the way some items like this may on occasion. You can really tell that they took the time to create a quality product here, which I thoroughly appreciate and I will definitely be a customer in the future. For now, to you, I just have to say highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "These are the exact replacement pads for Shark Steam and Scrub \u2013 S7001 model in my case. The pack comes with 4 standard microfiber pads and 2 abrasive pads.MICROFIBER PADS:Form, fit and function these are identical to the original Shark branded pads packed with the steam mop. Although they\u2019re primarily for hardwood floors I tried them on slate tiles and actually did a good job of cleaning surface dirt and minor stains. I had no issues of the pads falling off or sliding out.ABRASIVE PADS:These are actually microfiber pads but with embedded \u201cstubble\u201d \u2013 (3-Day beard/scrub). DO NOT use these on hardwood floors! They\u2019re not exactly abrasive as steel-wool but I can see them scratching or leaving swirl marks on dark wood floors. However, on tiles these are excellent! Not only they cleaned the surface of the tile but they also removed stuck dirt and grimes in and around the pattern. As with the microfiber pads, I had no issues with them coming off or sliding out.Anyone looking for standard replacement pads for Shark Steam and Scrub, as well as abrasive pads for tiles this is the pack you\u2019re looking for. They\u2019re washable/reusable, appears well-made and depending how often used, should last for long time. Great value and highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "When i first saw the pads I thought that they were too large for my steam mop. To my surprise they fit. I can't compare the pads to the original pads because I purchased the mop used and no pads were included. I always use the deep steam setting on the mop and the pads seem to get the job done. You get many more pads than other brands that charge the same price.",
