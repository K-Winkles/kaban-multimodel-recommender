                "reviewText": "I had a great amount of grease buildup on my refrigerator. I didn\u2019t want to use chemicals and this steamer just got me so happy to start getting out the trenches of depression. I placed the nozzle close so the heat was able to melt the buildup and all I did was wipe clean. No scrubbing at all.It also steams clothing, which is great because the materials I have in my wardrobe are better without an iron.Heats up super fast.Someone gave a tip unplug and to press the button to release the steam so it can be opened faster than waiting for it to cool down. thanks \ud83d\ude09 I did exactly that. Haven\u2019t used all the attachments yet, but I\u2019m impressed. I did steam a niqab I was intending on wear and it was great to just hang and steam.The nozzle does need to be supported because it is like a ball and joint it moves. * It was me and not locking it in place. It\u2019s lightweight and very easy to use. I actually locked it in place by mistake, but now, I\u2019m totally happier than a little now. Make sure to empty the device and let air dry to prolong the life of the steamer. I used just tap water. Vinagre is acidic so I\u2019m not adding that to my device.Improvement suggestions:Create a window to see if water is out and an indicator light to show when to fill more water.I over filled on purpose and steam and blobs of water were the result of that.",

I definitely holds a lot of water and you can get a good amount of steam out of just one use only down side is that on the 4th use it started to steam from all ends and reeked of toxic chemical plastics. It was plugged in and in use for a min and I couldn\u2019t believe that it had already broke down after the first few uses. Spend a little extra more and get yourself a higher end one because this one won\u2019t last you long.",

                "reviewText": "Kiato Steam Cleaner ReviewI received my Kiato steam cleaner last week\u2014but with some major remodeling coming up beginning Monday\u2014I just got the chance to use it.Here\u2019s what I found:1. Unlike most steam cleaners, this one has 8 full minutes of steam cleaning before you have to refill it and wait. It doesn\u2019t take much. I even poured out some water after I was done.2. It comes with oodles of attachments for windows, car interiors, clothes, etc.3. It has a very long cord. 12 feet. Also it\u2019s lightweight. About 4.5 lbs.4. It shoots out bursts of steam at a high speed but it\u2019s not overly watery.5. It worked amazing and easily on my window sills and corners. Blew the dirt right out while cleaning it. I used it on my fridge grate at the bottom\u2014really cleaned it. I used it on the tile at the base of the dishwasher. Cleaned it right up. I used it around the base of the bottom over door. Did very well. Cleaned around the faucets. Did well there also. I got those ugly bolts that hold your car seats in completely clean. Used one of their small brushes.What it didn\u2019t do:1. I tried\u2014for the heck of it\u2014to see if it would remove grease from a stoneware piece I had. It doesn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t remove grease very quickly from the oven either. I had a few spots and found a degreaser wipe was better.Was it with it? Yes and yes! I\u2019ll use it in my new bathroom on the shower doors too. Worked amazing on the toilet without having to use chemicals since I have a toilet drinker in the house!",
