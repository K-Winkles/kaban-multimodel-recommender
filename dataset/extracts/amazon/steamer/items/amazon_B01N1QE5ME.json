The device is amazing, heated really quickly, no spills and left my clothes wrinkle free regardless of the fabric. I used filtered water and it got the job done. I had the Conair which cost me almost $60 but it had specific instructions on maintenance and the type of water to use. I had to buy vinegar and distilled water to clean it. It did last me a few years until it was spitting water and dirty water... which constantly required more maintenance. After cleaning the Conair with vinegar again it started spitting hot water and then stopped steaming. I had to get a new one since the Conair stopped working after I had it several years. I must say this apparatus gets the job done and quickly. It's affordable and it works. I'm a Prime member so I got next day delivery which worked out cause I needed to steam my clothes for a job interview plus my Conair stopped working",

                "reviewText": "This a great steamer with lots of nice features. It heats up very quickly, produces lots of hot steam, is easy to use the auto button so you don't have to keep holding it down, plus you never have to worry about water dripping out no matter the angle you use it at. The two things I'd say the manufacturer could improve on are with the water container - 1) you fill it upside down yet the markings are right side up so you have to eyeball what the maximum water level should be - maybe include markings the other way so it's easier to fill the to proper level? 2) I was able to steam about 4-5 shirts at a time so a larger water capacity tank would be a nice upgrade!",

                "reviewText": "Follow-up to my original review: After I left my 1-star review, the manufacturer contacted me and offered a full refund. I accepted the offer, and then used that money to buy another one at a lower price, since it happened to be Prime Days. So those are both good things! As originally stated, I liked this steamer until it stopped working. So I am going to revise to 4 stars. The one star off is because I stand by the fact that this should not be essentially disposable. I'm going to donate my broken one to a kid who is learning how to repair things, and wants broken items to tinker with. Otherwise, it's a lot of plastic that doesn't need to go into a landfill.Here is my original review: I was so happy with this steamer. I got it to replace my previous, smaller, travel steamer that I had decided was too small. I liked this because the reservoir was relatively large, the ease of use, the functionality, etc. I loved that I could steam an entire multi-piece suit or outfit without having to stop and change the water. It heated up fast. It worked really well with a great steam flow and never spit. I liked that the steam button could be locked for continuous steam. It's a little large for travel, but still packable. However...it suddenly stopped working after I steamed half a shirt the other day! After that, it would turn on, but just leak water from around the push button and wouldn't heat up to steam anymore. I bought it in March, so I'm outside the return window. If I had had this for 5 years, it would be one thing for it to stop working. But 6.5 months and about 8 uses makes it a waste of money and a lot of material to go to a landfill for what is essentially a disposable product. Now I'll go back to my previous travel steamer that I have been using for 15 plus years. Annoyed. Aarrrggghhh!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer September 2022, and only had used it a couple times (I don\u2019t have a ton of clothes that I need to steam). When I went to use it in August 2023, it wasn\u2019t working correctly. It would heat up but steam wouldn\u2019t come out (I didn\u2019t have this experience before). I reached out to this company\u2019s customer support via email. Within a day or two I got a reply with some troubleshoot tips. I tried those and still had no luck getting it to steam. The gal I emailed with asked for my address to send a replacement. I had a new steamer within one week. They replaced this item I\u2019ve had for almost a year because there is a 24 month warranty. Their customer support team made this incredibly fast and easy. So friendly and helpful too! I was thoroughly impressed!! This company truly backs their product! As for the steamer itself, works like a champ! Not sure what the issue was with my last one\u2026but either way, my new steamer works great! As advertised, you can hold it upright or horizontally like an iron. Heats up super fast, like a couple minutes. It will dribble/spit out a couple drops of water every now and then, but it isn\u2019t an issue as it\u2019s only water and not ruining anything! It does make like a continual clicking sound when you\u2019re holding down the steam button. It doesn\u2019t bother me, and I didn\u2019t even notice after a while. If you struggle with sensory overload issues, then you might not like the noise this product makes. It\u2019s not loud, and like I said it didn\u2019t bother me at all. Just wanted to mention it as that might be important to some people. I was able to steam 4 shirts on my first fill of the water chamber. With more practice, I\u2019m sure I could do more than 4, as I\u2019m kinda slow getting back into using a steamer. Also, had some shirts with odd fabric that were stubborn, so that took a little more time. No issues with stopping from overheating either.",

I have had this steamer for about a year, and it works great. I use ONLY distilled water, and I like that it has a metal plate that you can use to iron as you steam. As you can see, these thick curtains had some really deep wrinkles and the steamer took care of them in a snap! It gets really hot and is portable if you need it for travel.P.S. I'm not being paid for this review. I just really like my steamer.",
