                "reviewText": "This is surprisingly fast and easy to use. This was an upgrade from the more traditional bamboo steamer I've always used. The bamboo steamer was a bit small and never quite fit any of the pots I've ever owned, so I was always afraid of one or both layers toppling over.This steamer, being it's own unit, fits perfectly on the base using either 1 or 2 of the steaming trays. You can see the food, see the remaining water level, and add water as needed while cooking. None of this is possible using a bamboo or metal steamer without removing the lid and/or steaming trays from the pot. That convenience alone is what makes me really enjoy this cooker.On top of that, cook times have been way less than using the old bamboo steamer. I think the more secure connection this steamer has, as well as the abundance of holes in both trays eliminating blockages plays a rule in the faster cooking time. Additionally, the size of the trays are perfect for preparing a meal for 5+ people.I am really happy to have finally made this purchase. One I've been putting off for years because my bamboo steamer was \"good enough\". I never really thought it could be this great though. Would definitely buy again, and definitely recommend.",

Tried some frozen snow crab legs over the last weekend and they were perfect! So easy to set it up and to use as well as to clean it too! Double stacking trays means you can make a lot all at once and be ready to eat in 10-20 minutes on most of the items above I made. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for times of \"Food Sensitivity\"",
                "reviewText": "Had a scheduled surgery involving my mouth and the medical staff warned me I would have some extreme mouth sensitivity to flavors and hard/crunchy textures for a couple weeks. Basically I invested in this thing to help cook foods softer that I knew my mouth could handle and I could control both the seasoning and salt levels.>WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE PURCHASE:Invest in some great seasonings, (Ideally Salt Free) YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF.Flavor God and FitMenCook are my go to brands.>THE GREAT:It works and it works well. Because I was also away from work for a couple weeks, I basically played the game of \"DOES IT STEAM?\" You will be surprised what you can steam, the freshness of the food. My go to was soft fish and soft vegetables like carrots, cauliflower, sweet potato. I actually enjoyed the natural flavors of the food, without seasoning. However, as my mouth healed I started introducing flavors to keep me interested. It does a great job and steaming ground pork and beef! Great recipe over noodles or rice.THE GOOD:Size is pretty good. You can put enough food in here for more than one person or if you are meal prepping. I also like the double decker compacity to do more than one type of food item at a time. The heating picks up very quickly and your food cooks fast.THE NOT SO GOOD:Theres a small learning curve you will need to get use too. Alot of us know when food is done by look or smell. Since the cook baskets get foggy you cant rely on look unless you want to lift the lid which compromises the heat. (Not a major deal at all). Honestly it was nice playing around with different food variety. There is a guide which tells you how long certain food should cook so you wont go in blind.>My only gripe would be the cooking timer aesthetics. The numbers on the dial are black. They are very hard to see unless you are directly in front of dial or bend down. This is kind of a \"set it and forget\" type device so this isn't a deal breaker but more of a final design flaw.>OVERALL:Great product to cook with, control your salt intake, eat healthier foods overall. My favorites items arefish, store bought dumplings, root vegetables, ground pork.",

                "reviewText": "So, it's July 2022 and I've had this since early December 2021. This is one of the most used items I've bought in ages!! I use it every day, be it to cook some eggs or steam some vegetables for part of dinner or a quick snack. It doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space, and works very simply & efficiently.This is likely one of my favourite & useful purchases from Amazon--(which is saying a lot!!).If you've ever struggled to peel hard-boiled eggs, your difficult mission ends here. - I still haven't worked out the secret, but you can make up to 16 eggs at a time and all you have to do is chill them in the fridge (hot might work, too-- haven't tried it) and then crack the bottom and peel.-- I do it under a stream of water and each egg takes about 10-15 seconds. -Magic!!This is great for all types of vegetables-- haven't tried it on fruit, as that's not really up my alley, but I'm sure it would be a success also.I know this review is long, but if you're looking for something like this, I wanted to give my full take on it. :) I'm sure there are many uses I haven't even explored, but this is most definitely worth your money!~Chantal :)",
