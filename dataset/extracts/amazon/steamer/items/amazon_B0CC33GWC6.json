                "reviewText": "This is a sharp looking steamer with a comfortable grip. It is easy to use right out of the box. Pretty intuitive, the instructions told me nothing I couldn't have figured out on my own. This steamer has a nice long cord, pretty great if the outlet is a distance away from the item being steamed. The grip is comfortable and the steaming button conveniently placed. I'm impressed with how smoothly the water reservoir locks on and off. The fabric brush is removable, exposing a little ironing plate that you could use in a pinch. While this unit is fairly compact, it is larger than other travel steamers I have seen. All in all though, this is a handy appliance to have around, for steaming curtains, clothing and the like. It's well designed and manufactured without any obvious flaws or blemishes. 5 Stars.",

                "reviewText": "This is marketed as lightweight and it is not very heavy but not super compact for a suitcase. I have utilized it at home for work items that I cannot iron like certain fabric. It comes out of the box read to use. It does not take very long to heat up and get ready for use. The tanks where you put the water does not leak which is different than some of the other steamers I have tried, which do leak. The tank can be fully removed, which is really nice to fill up, unlike the other steamers I have that do not come apart. The chord is pretty long and longer than some other steamers as well. It is easy to work and pretty self explanatory. It works well and gets wrinkles out of the clothing items after a few passes. I would recommend this steamer to anyone looking.",

My only complaint is that it's hard to dump out all of the \"extra\" water from the bottom chamber when you're done, so you have to let it finish drying on the counter for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "Build quality:The quality is very good. It isn't what I would consider lightweight -- it actually feels pretty solid and substantial to me -- Yet I think it only weighs ~1.5lbs. The plastic is sturdy and the steam button has a good \"click\" feedback. The cord is a good quality and a good length ~10' which is about what you would expect. All in all I am VERY impressed with the qualityNo mess, Clean secure water tank.The water reservoir feels very well engineered and allows you remove it from the unit and fill it up separately. It can be closed after filling for transporting and it twists to lock in place on the steamer.UseWe use this a home for quick jobs. Its very easy to set up and use in a flash. The tank is enough for just about any one off job we have for steaming fabrics. It works very well and is very easy to handle especially on hanging items.Final ThoughtsThis is a great steamer for quick jobs. It is well made and works well. We highly recommend it.",
