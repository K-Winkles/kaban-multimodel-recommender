Easy to use, floor feels clean after being steamed, and lightweight. I love that the pads are washable so you do not have to buy extra pads like I had to with the Swiffer I used to use. First time you use it, it does take about 10 minutes for the water to process through before it begins steaming. But when it does start steaming, it is very obvious and you will know it is ready. I started using before it steamed and thought it was not a good machine....then the steam started and you can see it and hear it! You will love this product for wood or ceramic tile.",

The only problem was the handle now had to be duct taped and they thought they would never find another one. They bought 2 right then.I have had my Smart Living Steam Mop for 2.5 years. Although the pads are still somewhat usable I thought it might be time to order more. They came in two days and sure enough it was time.
