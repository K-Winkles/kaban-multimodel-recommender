                "reviewText": "My first complaint is that I really wish the power cord were a couple feet longer. My second complaint is that if you follow the fill line guide it will splash out of the fill hole before reaching the max fill line.In terms of performance... I'm very satisfied. I went to clean a condo where I don't believe the top of the kitchen cabinets have ever been cleaned before. And my multipurpose cleaner with mild degreaser was not getting the job done without a heavy dose of elbow grease. So I broke out this little steamer and it cut through it like a hot knife through butter. I also used it to clean their utility closets door track. Which, again, vacuuming and scrubbing with a brush and my multipurpose cleaner didn't quite do the job. I would advise caution on these more constricted areas as it does cause a lot more splashing. So please do use the gloves that are provided or similar thick gloves.One use that I really wish I had taken a before and after photo of was their bath tub. It took care of the mildew and the built up soap scum in the grout so beautifully. And the bottom of the tub has these non slip lines that just don't ever seem to scrub clean, even with barkeepers friend. And this little machine cleaned them so well that you cannot even tell the non slip feature exists.I've also used it in my home to get marker and crayon out of my tile grout. It's especially great for those hard to reach corners and crevices that no brush or cloth can seem to reach.As for the size of the reservoir, I did have to refill twice for the cabinet job and once for the tub, but I've learned to just carry a 16oz water bottle that I can refill it with rather than dragging the machine itself to the sink. And with as much water as you'll be blasting around, get yourself a bunch of microfiber towels or those sham wow things. Something that absorbs a lot, wrings well, and dries quickly. I found I rarely needed it above setting 3 and when used at a higher setting you'll definitely go through the reservoir much faster. And it will fog your glasses much more at the higher settings.Overall, I really enjoy this little guy. I don't think I could go back to before I had one.",

However, I think the fact the steam goes down a long tube creates condensate and then the output is half steam/half water. It makes a mess. Also, the brass fittings are needed but it was too easy to grab the brass instead of the small protective handle. I burnt my fingers many times and started wearing gloves. Didn't clean very well.

                "reviewText": "The nozzle comes off very frequently, the heating element causes the steamer to spurt lots of water before concentrated steam is produced. There is no switch in the handle. After about 10 uses the product has stopped producing steam entirely. It gets hot but no steam is pumped out.",

It's a really powerful compact steamer especially for the price. Just be careful....the parts come loose if you don't more than finger tighten them. And, though I shouldn't really have to say this, but the metal parts GET REALLY HOT! ;-)",
