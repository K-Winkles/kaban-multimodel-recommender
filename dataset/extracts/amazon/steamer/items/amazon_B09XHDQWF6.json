Whether it's tackling tough stains, refreshing curtains, giving car seats a new lease on life, or even cleaning windows, this portable pressurized steamer gets the job done efficiently.A surprising and highly effective use I discovered is its prowess in exterminating cockroaches. The intense heat emitted by the steam cleaner is more than sufficient to eliminate these pests on contact, offering a chemical-free solution that aligns with my preference for eco-friendly methods.The 350ml large capacity is a boon, as it allows for extended cleaning sessions without frequent refills. The comprehensive 11-piece accessory set further enhances its versatility, making it suitable for a range of surfaces and cleaning needs.In a nutshell, the Handheld Steam Cleaner has met my expectations.

It takes me forever to remove the cap and then once removed, it takes forever to tighten it back on. I honestly kept turning it clockwise for the duration of a movie before it remotely tightened. When cleaning it's not good with cleaning anything. I wish that I could return it, but I held on hoping that it would work if I continued to tinker with it. Stay away from this item and all those from this brand!!!!",

I use it at full steam strength, it's very powerful,Ease of use:No problem - it's easy to fill the tank with distilled water to prevent calcium buildup, flip the switch, and let it heat up. I use it soon cause too hot automatically will make the system safe to use!Features and functions:This machine has a large number of accessories and almost every cleaning you can think of. When changing accessories, multifunctional cleaning helps to clean the home!User experience:Using this machine is easy and lightweight, and my fingers or joints don't get as tired as they used to with other machines. I like that this machine is easy to use.Compared with similar products:The only steam machine I can recommend is the steam machine because it can steam clean things more cleanly!Recommended:I would recommend it to anyone who needs to steam clean floors, kitchens, bathrooms, cars. It's durable!",

                "reviewText": "I don't review much on Amazon, but felt compelled this time. DO NOT BUY THIS!! I have owned other similar steamers and this is by far the worst. A big sell point for me was the 'Continuous button' which is supposed to keep the trigger pressed, as your hand can quickly tire. But when using this button, the level of steam is 50% less than when you press the trigger hard yourself. They stress not to overfill it, but there is no way to see the water level. You have to just guess from the measuring cup. If you fill it up to start and then use 50% of the water during your project, you have to sit there and hold the trigger until no more steam comes out. It is not quick. My previous steamer had a valve that you could release a little steam pressure before opening the main valve. Like most China made products these days, the instructions were absolutely terrible. To the point that the weird wording and pictures could actually lead to someone getting hurt. And HERE is the best part, I used it 3 times the day it came, and then it just stopped working! I think of the cliches 'You get what you paid for' and 'Caveat Emptor'. I strongly recommend you do so as well and stay away. Hope this helps.",
