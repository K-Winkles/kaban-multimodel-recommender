Cons would be that the front plate takes a long time to cool down, so be careful when putting away. Also it is quite heavy. This was fatiguing on the wrist after a bit of steaming. Also the steam lock button is handy to keep the steam constantly going, but it is very easy to unlock. I found it easier to just hold down the steam button manually.",

I realized that it was time for a new one, but really preferred a more compact version due to our small space. My husband surprised me with this one for Christmas and it was just was I was looking for! It's compact but powerful enough to steam all my sweaters and dress pants. I really don't enjoy getting out the iron and ironing board if I can avoid it. So far, this has replaced my need to do that!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Rowenta steamer almost 3 years ago, and it was a wonderful steamer for the times that I used it. I followed the manual instructions exactly, and although I took care to empty the tank, used distilled water since my tap water is hard, and treated it carefully, it just quit working. It no longer produces steam and the instructions have no other trouble shooting solutions that work. I tried to find more info on the Rowenta site and wanted to see if there was another solution or a way to get it repaired because I was happy with how it worked when it was functioning. There was not a way to get additional support, and after looking at other reviews, I found several with the same complaint that it stopped working suddenly. Do NOT buy this unit. Find something else as this seems to be a common issue.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I bought this steamer to replace a series of cheaper ones that I\u2019d been using and replacing nearly yearly. First impression out of the box was that this was much nicer, more robust and heavy duty.I did notice water condensation in the tank when I first opened the box. My husband pointed out that they probably test it at the factory. Lo and behold, it said this in tiny print on the box. So, it wasn\u2019t used but just quality-controlled!Using the steamer was really nice compared to my previous ones. I like the on/off button and auto shut-off for when I step away. I\u2019m quite keen on the bubbling sound it makes when I steam, as I know it\u2019s drawing on the water reservoir and it sounds like a friendly kettle. The unit is a bit heavier on account of its better construction, but that doesn\u2019t phase me for normal daily use. For travel, it would be a bit bulky/heavy and I\u2019d consider purchasing a smaller/folding travel version instead.I would recommend this steamer as well as Roweta products. I also have an iron which I adore!",
