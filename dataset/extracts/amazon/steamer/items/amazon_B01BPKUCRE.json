If you read and follow the directions carefully and only used distilled water, you'll have no issues with this machine.It steams incredibly well. It just takes a moment to get going. I reccomend using a thinner towel to throw over the back of your head for the face steamer, the thicker the towel the harder it'll be to breathe. You need some common sense using this, because if your forehead gets the brunt of the steam it'll run into you're eyes with sweat and burn so be sure to wipe off the steam atound your eyes and pull back away from it more. Because I'm tall I had to sit up further to prevent this. I'm surprised how hot it actually gets to the point I have to take breaks to wipe the steam from my eyelids and get some cool air. It makes extractions around the nose, chin, and forehead so much easier and has helped our skin clear up more along with our regular skincare routine.It even works great as a humidifier by my desk. I haven't tried the towel steamer yet but I have no doubt it works great. Even the toolkit provided is durable and gets the job done.I do plan on ordering more of these as gifts.",

Even though it's designed for more of a spa-day experience, I bought it because I was desperate for some warm steam to clear my sinuses. The facial setting worked great for that. I wish it were more portable, but the cord is long enough for me to be able to sit where I wanted. I'll have to try its other functions soon.",

No plastic pieces wrapped around metal, it\u2019s all one piece and can be easily cleaned. I\u2019ve used it every night since I purchased. It surely will remain as part of my nightly routine. I had another face steamer you had to basically sit your face in it. It\u2019s nice to sit back and have some space from the steamer. My skin loves this thing. It leaves my skin so dewey and moist. Love love love.",

                "reviewText": "ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchased this unit after trying a different brand that was constantly breaking. After returning 2 units within 2 weeks, I decided to try a different brand. I found the Pure NanoSteamer to have a superior design (specifically with the water tank) over the pink one with the handle which you see sold under several names here on Amazon. This has much less risk of breaking.This has a good size water tank which allows for a much longer steam than other units. It takes about 1 1/2 minutes for the steam to start, and lasts about 20 minutes. The hand towel steamer takes a about a minute longer, if using a wet towel. I did not think I would use the towel steamer, but once I tried it, I love it and use it every day to remove cleanser.The one small negative is the height. It sits too high to use while sitting at my vanity. The steam goes over my head when sitting. It needs to be on a low coffee table, which isn\u2019t practical for daily use. When standing it hits my neck, but I have to bend to hit the face. The solution for me, whether standing or sitting, is to put a towel over head to capture the steam. This makes it very intense steam! I have to come for air a few times, but it feels great. You need a longer towel for this method, the regular hand towel will put you too close to the steam. You don\u2019t want to get burned, so get something bigger. I found that a 20 x 31\u201d Turkish cotton hand towel works perfectly.Regarding essential oils\u2026 I believe most manufacturers are saying not to use essential oils, and yet we all want to use essential oils with our steamers. So the following is my opinion only, based on my experience. This is not any sort of recommendation. Ignoring the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations is something you do at your own risk. But I use 5 drops of eucalyptus oil in my steamer. I\u2019ve been doing this twice daily for over 2 months and have not had any issues. I do clean it every week or 2 with a vinegar/water solution to avoid any buildup of the oils.BTW, I have NOT been compensated for this review. I researched and purchased the item I wanted and paid full price.UPDATE:After nearly a year, my NanoSteamer died. It might sound strange, but I bought the same steamer again to replace it. Even though it only lasted about a year, I used it daily, sometimes twice daily. So I got a lot of use out of it. And for the price, I feel like it was a good deal. I did look around some to see if there was anything new out there which I might like better. But the NanoSteamer had the features I want, and I know that it works great. This time I will not use essential oils in the steamer. That may be the reason it eventually stopped working, I don't know. But I found an even better way to use them, without adding them to the steamer. I put just a drop of eucalyptus oil on a cotton pad and, using tweezers so I don't burn my fingers, I hold the cotton into the steam. I get a lot more of the eucalyptus vapor, using just one drop of oil, than I previously did adding 5 drops to the steamer. I think this is a good solution for those like myself who really want or need to use essential oils.The newer model I received also came with some \"free\" skin care tools. \"Free\" in quotes, because the price has actually gone up $10 since the last time I purchased. I would have preferred the lower price and skip the tools I won't use. But I'm still very happy with the NanoSteamer and still feel it is the best option out there, unless you want to spend a few hundred $$ for a professional system.",

Did not take long to heat up and is so much better than the enclosed old school ones.Bigger than I thought but it does look pretty \ud83d\ude0dNeeded to put on bench instead of the table, will probably use piano stool next time as that is the perfect height so I can at least sit down. Using the table I had to stand and I don\u2019t want to do that! You can see the difference between the table, bench and piano stool. Also showing a video of how quick it takes for the steamer to start up.The steam did wonders \ud83e\udd29 No sides to put my face into, lots of steam comes out, and helped with my cold. I can definitely say I can breathe a lot better, nose and throat cleared so I don't feel clogged up like I did before using it.It\u2019s like being in a steam room but just for your face and neck. I was dripping \ud83e\udd29 after 10 mins.Checked my smart meter and used 8p (but we also have at least 20 other devices switched on as well including charging a laptop, we are a tech house. Just so you know my unit rates are 29.38p/kwh | standing charge 45.56p/day if this is of any help. Inc. VAT.I only decided to get a newer one after watching the Gadget Show and saw their reviews on several steamers. This wasn\u2019t on the show but the reviews caught my eyes so decided to go with this instead. Over 38K reviews with 4.5 stars, you can\u2019t give this a miss. I used Klarna to make the payment, but the price is also a bargain \u00a339.95 \ud83d\ude0d I\u2019ve just got chrimbo out the way, I\u2019m skint already \ud83d\ude02Personally \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 is what I\u2019ll post all day long!",

Praktisch ist auch, dass ein Set an Pickelentfernern mitgeliefert wird. Damit kann man im Anschluss direkt die Mitesser entfernen.Erstaunlich was da alles in kurzer Zeit rauskommt!Eine Tankf\u00fcllung dauert ca. 15 Minuten. Aber auch weniger Zeit reicht bereits aus, um die Haut danach zu reinigen.Danach f\u00fchlt sich die Haut weich und angenehm an.Hinzu finde ich das Benutzen als angenehm, wohltuend und erfrischend.Als Wasser verwende ich gekauftes Wasser, da Leitungswasser Kalk enth\u00e4lt und das Ger\u00e4t besch\u00e4digen kann. Dies steht auch in der Gebrauchsanweisung.An sich sieht das Ger\u00e4t farblich gut und sch\u00f6n aus. Ich kann verschiedene Modi bei der Benutzung einstellen.Alles in allem finde ich das Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis auch top! F\u00fcr knapp 40\u20ac kann man da echt nichts falsch machen. Das Produkt h\u00e4lt was es verspricht! Es ist n\u00fctzlich, tut gut und hat keine Nebenwirkungen auf der Haut, wie bei Cremes etc. Der Dampf dringt tief in die Haut ein und mit dem Set kann man alles leicht ausdr\u00fccken.Der Hersteller hat sich hier gr\u00fcndlich Gedanken gemacht und ein ordentliches Set entwickelt! Ich w\u00fcrde es jederzeit wieder kaufen!",
