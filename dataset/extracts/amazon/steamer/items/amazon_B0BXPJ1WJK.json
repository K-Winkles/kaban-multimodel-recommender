                "reviewText": "This steamer is really good! Its compact, but feels heavy for its size, so they seem to use good material in it. It also is and easy to pack and use. It worked great on my wife's cotton dress that she steamed from a hanger, after it arrived very wrinkled from the store and she had to wear it to a business meeting. Did not leave any stains, no smells, no marks, and needed a very light touch. Warmed up quickly. Other products like it were way more expensive, so that is why we went with this option. I am very pleased with the purchase. Would recommend!",
