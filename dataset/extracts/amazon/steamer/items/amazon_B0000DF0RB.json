                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Combine this with a vacuum feature & it'd be 6 stars",
                "reviewText": "Read a lot of reviews when deciding between this and the similar Wagner item. Ultimately got this one because it was available as a Warehouse Deal for under $95. For me it's probably really a 4.5 star item. I'd give it 6 stars if it had a strong vacuum feature built in to pull up the dirty liquid. Many people knock this device for unfair reasons. #1 bad rap is water coming out of the nozzle instead of steam. Come on people, use your brains! Steam is vaporized water. If you run steam through a few feet of cool tubing it's going to condense into water. There are ways to work around this. Use it continuously rather than brief spurts which reduces the water and makes the steam hotter or use a pail, directing the first few seconds into the pail until the water is gone. Also, once the steam hits something cool it will condense into water so be ready to wipe. BTW, that brings up another gripe that people mention. Continuous use will cause the nozzle and trigger parts to get pretty warm. Not really much of an issue. Others gripe that the steam isn't hot enough. It's a matter of opinion, I guess, but there are some realities involved. Your wall outlets will only support about 1800 watts so a machine like this can only heat so much water to turn it into steam. To get it hotter would mean less steam production or you'd have to plug it into a 240v outlet and many people don't have that. Continuous use does a lot for upping the steam temperature. If the steam were much hotter, you'd be reading complaints about melted and deformed plastics. I think this machine strikes the appropriate balance. One legitimate gripe is the flimsy plastic construction. Has plastic gotten so expensive that making the parts 50% thicker would add that much to the cost? I accept the device for what it is. A tool that most people will only be using occasionally. There are better, more sturdy devices for people who'll use this frequently.I've had it a couple of weeks and tried it on various things. Windows: works pretty good but a little messy. I used a chamois to clean up the water drips. Really great with a spray bottle of strong cleaner to clean your vinyl window casings, seals and felt scrapers. Again, chamois with a bucket of clean water gives best results. Walls: works pretty good to clean cooking oils and cigarette smoke film from glossy paints. This pretty much dissolves cigarette smoke film on anything from paint to plastics to metal or glass. Vinyl Mini Blinds: Oh, such a pain to clean with anything. I sprayed them with some strong cleaner, gave it a minuet or two and they came out pretty darn good. I think removal and cleaning in the bathtub might make the job less messy and would make rinsing easier. Microwave: I get mine pretty clean with a scrubber sponge and normal dish soap but finishing off with steam is the icing on the cake. Gets the nooks and crannies, corners and grills. Touchpad looked new and the rest of the oven was darn close. Upholstery: May get certain stains loosened up but this is really no substitute for a suction type upholstery cleaner and soap. I wasn't too impressed. Sink and Countertop: I have very hard water and my issues are more with calcium deposits than grime. This did nothing for water deposits. Leather Jacket: Used steam as a first step in a re-dye. Worked OK but not a big advantage over saddle soap and a brush. Took about 90 minutes to do a really good job. Coffee Maker: Didn't do much better than dishwasher plus soap and a sponge. Deep Fryer: Thought this would do a really good job but it was no better than using a strong degreaser and scrubber sponge with hot water from the sink. Slow and messy. Included scrubber pad clogged quickly and wore fast. Stove and Toaster Oven: Fine for hard to get to edges of the glass top on the stove but don't think this is your ticket for removing burnt-on food.Other random observations- The little brushes suck. they're too stiff when you start and too soft after a few minutes of use. The scrubber was unimpressive too. All these things wore down quickly and you're better off using a scrubber or brush that suits your need and use the steam to assist the scrubbing process. The window squeegee worked fine but sopping up the water is a pain. Much quicker than Windex and paper towels. Zero streaks. Did not use the mop attachment. Having no water gauge is lame. You don't know when your going to need to add water and then you don't know how much to add when it's not empty. The wheels seem mostly useless. I pick it up and move it.Overall I'm very happy with my little steam cleaner and I haven't even used it for the 2 things I bought it for, removing wallpaper and detailing car interiors. Unless you have a specific thing that you need a steam machine for (like wallpaper or bedbugs) you should think of this as another tool in your cleaning arsenal. It probably won't replace anything else you have now, it'll just help you to do a better job. Sometimes it'll save you time. Sometimes it'll save you work. For the most part, it's not going to save you a lot in cleaning chemicals. You'll mostly still use those. I understand these are really great with the hard plastics in a used car. I can see this as a great tool for cleaning a refrigerator. Not sure about the germ cleaning capabilities, I have my doubts about using this, alone, to mop a floor when your goal is killing germs. A bucket of very hot water and mop solution is probably more effective. All said, I definitely would buy it again and recommend it to friends.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT STEAM CLEANER",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this product to assist in an engine restoration / rebuild and I have to admit, I was almost expecting to be dissapointed in the machines ability to remove 30+ years of oil deposits and sludge. I am happy to say that I have been very impressed with how well this steamer works. (For an overall review of the steamer, skip to the second paragraph as I will detail how well it works on engine parts here first). Through trial and error, I found the best way to use the steamer on small engine parts (piston heads for example) is to secure the operating handle to a stationary object at a working height (I used duct tape to secure the handle to a lighting stand). The hose is plenty long enough to secure it at a standing or sitting height. Attach the jet-point nozzle to the end of the handle wand and select an appropriate detail wire brush for scrubbing (your own wire brush). When the unit reaches operating pressure, pull the trigger and activate the trigger lock, so you are hands free from the wand. You can now hold the engine part in one hand and the wire brush in the other (if you are smart you will wear rubber gloves, safety goggles and a respirator). Hold the steam directly onto the part in one specific spot for about 4 to 5 seconds before begining to scrub. Burnt oil deposits come off with only moderate pressure applied with the brush. The steam will run continuousy for about 40 minutes. Refilling and reheating to operating pressure takes only 15 minutes. Accessory attachments include a plastic scraper nozzle and bronze wire brush nozzle which are excellent for larger, flat items like a skid plate, oil pan, or frame rail. For smaller parts or those with a lot of contour, you will have to use the jet-point nozzle and your own wire brush, but it works like a champ. Much better than a parts washer and water-based solvents. You can order additional nozzles in 5 packs (bronze wire brush) which isn't a bad idea if you have a lot of large parts.In general, this steamer is a very well made product. It is compact, lightweight and has numerous useful attachments. I cannot state how important it is to read the instructions for the best results and to avoid damage to certain surfaces. The unit provides continuous steam for 40+ minutes at a temperature that cleans very effectively. There is no such thing as \"dry\" steam cleaning. Some manufacturers try to make that claim based on the fact that once a surface has been heated to the temperature of the steam, when the steam is removed the temperature of the surface itself will evapoate any remaining water vapor and the surface will feel dry; however, there will have been a reasonable amount of water vapor and condensation produced to get to that point, so the surrounding area will still be damp. Understand that when objects heat and cool condensation occurs, so there is no such thing as dry steam cleaning. Condensation also occurs inside the hose, wand and nozzle in between steam applications, so when the trigger is activated after an idle period, water will be expelled from the nozzle before the steam starts to flow. Direct this water into a sink, toliet, tub or bucket during cleaning (if you are using it outside, it probably doesn't matter). Use care if you are cleaning hardwood or faux-wood floors. A mistake on fabric or carpet usually just means it will be wet and have to dry out, on a wood floor this steam can warp or de-laminate surfaces if applied improperly - read the instructions. Despite the warnings - I bet that most people would love this steam cleaner and find many uses for it. I found it excellent for windows, bathrooms, kitchen areas and cleaning engine parts.My only knock on the design is that it does not carry its accessories well. There is a net provided to be placed on the end of the machine that I don't like - it isn't very useful, and the tote bag for the larger floor accessories is flimsy and unsecure; so my advice is to buy a plastic bin and keep the machine and accessories stored in it when not in use. Also, the stickers on the wheels fell off out of the box, but I didn't like them anyway.The McCulloch name is a sub of Vornado Air, which is a sub of Husqvarna, so I was hoping to see \"Made in Canada\" or \"Made in Mexico\" (there is no hope of seeing Made in USA, but I wanted to see anywhere but you know where), but alas, like everything else it is made in China.",
