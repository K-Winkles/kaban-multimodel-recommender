                "reviewText": "This items is precious. The cutest iron you have ever seen. However, it worked once for me and then stopped. Unfortunately this meant I was out of the country for two weeks with very wrinkled clothes. I then had to bring the broken iron back with me (I wanted to toss so bad to save room in my luggage). It also smelt like melted rubber the one time it kind of worked. I may have gotten a bad product but it\u2019s not worth the hassle of exchanging to find out.",

This hand-held portable hanging press is very effective and can quickly eliminate wrinkles on clothes, leaving clothes looking smooth and flat with texture. Very convenient for travel and daily use. It's a must-have for my business trip. It's worth it!",

I like that it has a heater base to place the steamer on and a small cup to show the minimum and maximum amount of water allowed in the steamer. I also like that the body rotates, which can help when placing water in it or it can also help when ironing some clothes. Would definitely recommend.",
