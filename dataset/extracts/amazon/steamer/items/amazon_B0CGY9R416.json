We highly recommend using distilled water to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up caused by hard water (tap water). Is it necessary to drain the water and reservoir after each use? It's best practice to drain the excess water from the tank and reservoir to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up. It also prevents water from spilling while in storage. I just got my steamer and the steam hose is really stiff. The hose is made with dual-insulated material to regulate temperature and once you start using your steamer, the hose will become softer. How do I troubleshoot leaking issues? Leaking usually happens when the water tank cap is not screwed properly to the water tank. This causes the tank to not sit on the steamer perfectly, causing water leak.",

I seriously don't know how I didn't have a full-sized steamer until now, nor how I survived without one. I absolutely despise ironing...avoid it at all cost. But then I walked into a clothing store a few months ago and saw one of the people working there steaming some clothing for a display. It just clicked...I needed a steamer!! I found this SALAV Professional Standing Garment Steamer, and I'm SO happy with it! I didn't want to spend a lot (these can be expensive), but of course, I wanted the quality of the top-of-the-line steamers. I don't think this is very far off! It seems to be good quality and really well made. It's really easy to put together, and even easier to use. You really need to use distilled water, which is only slightly inconvenient. However, if you use tap water, you do so at your own risk and you may need a new steamer in a few years. Especially with the heat it produces, the minerals in tap water are a killer for a machine like this. I found myself looking for things that needed to be steamed for the first week or so (I'm over that), just because it looks so nice when you're done! Get it. Get it now!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve only ever used small travel size steam irons so I don\u2019t have much to compare this full size steamer to, but I know I LOVE it! I actually ordered this to steam extremely large canvases in my art studio, but since I started using this, I\u2019v been steaming everything in my house from shirts and slacks to oversized table linens and drapery - I\u2019m steam crazy! It doesn\u2019t take long to set up, but I pored over the directions included, which were very clear and concise.I feel like the manufacturer of this product thought of everything. This steamer holds quite a bit of water, but it won\u2019t work if you only pour a small amount into the \u201cwell,\u201d but it holds quite a bit and I wasn\u2019t constantly refilling it like I would with a small hand held one. Great lengthy retractable cord that you don\u2019t have to wrap up after every use. This has a FOOT PEDAL that emits the steam which gets SUPER hot (obviously). I actually just ordered a steamer \u201cmitt\u201d separately from here on Amazon to protect my skin. The hand held head reminds me of my vacuum cleaner, the part that\u2019s detachable, which is so convenient and easy to use. The rack from which to hang garments from is super helpful and has clips that keep your items in place. But most importantly, it works - and it works well. I can\u2019t believe I waited this long to try a steamer like this. I\u2019m thrilled about the amount of money we\u2019ll be saving by steaming pieces ourselves instead of taking to the dry cleaners. Overall, just very impressed with this \u201ctool\u201d and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Personally, I'd rather live in wrinkly clothes than spend my brief time on earth ironing them. Ordered this garment steamer hoping for a better solution.Set-up is straightforward, it's easier and slightly faster than ironing. I don't think it de-wrinkles as well as ironing, depending on fabric; the 100% cotton curtain took more effort/passes than the pants and I never could get it totally smooth which an iron could. Oddly, it wrinkled back up a bit later on (the \"after\" photo was taken immediately). Maybe I needed to pull it tauter? The viscose/poly pants took very little time. Preferable to ironing even with minor deficit in performance.Takeaway - Some quirks I'm slightly annoyed with (details below) but overall, happy to have this garment steamer and look forward to nicer-looking clothes. If you have the space and hate ironing, I recommend it. Has a 1-year warranty. If I notice issues as I use it more I will update review.More details - Tank is easy to fill and pour out, but water left standing in machine requires you to pull a plug and drain the rest. I had to find a shallow dish to place under the drain hole. There was still water visible in machine, it was awkward tilting the whole thing to coax it out. I can't tell the difference between \"low\" and \"high\" setting. It slows and sputters a bit if the hose is not kept straight enough, which isn't always easy to do when maneuvering up, down, and around a garment. I like the continuous steam but it would be nice if there were a temporary stop (like on some shower heads) to use while putting one garment aside and setting up another. The wheels don't roll well but I'm putting it in the laundry room and won't need to move it much. The cord is only about 6 ft. You may want to get a steam-proof mitt. Used distilled water to avoid funk and mineral build-up.",
