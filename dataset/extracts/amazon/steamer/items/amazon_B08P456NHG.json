The first time I used it I was in a rush one morning to get to work, and the sweater I wanted to wear was pretty wrinkly from being folded in my dresser. I remembered that I had this and filed it up and within 5 or so minutes my sweater was ready to wear. I have used it a number of times now and love the results I get. Also very compact and affordable.",

                "reviewText": "This product and similar white-labled product is fantastic conceptually, however after just a few light uses (3 garments across 3 different days) the steam element stopped working and water would just drip out. The pump was still working and the iron itself was very hot, but just the steam element would not work, causing this item to be useless. do yourself a favor and get something more expensive to avoid a fiasco when you are on a trip and need to steam clothes quickly.Edit: Customer support reached out quickly and offered a refund. Modifying review to 4* for their fantastic support",
