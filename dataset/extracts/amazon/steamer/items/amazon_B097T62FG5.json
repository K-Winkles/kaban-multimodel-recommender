I was looking for something that I could travel with and not take up too much space in my suitcase. The Bear Steamer fit perfectly. My first use was on the trip that I am currently on as I am writing this review. The steamer is easy to use right out of the package. Fill with clean water, plug in. It heated up fast and works as designed. It was as effective the first go around, but that was operator error, yes me. Once I got comfortable with it was easy after that. Further, it steams for quite some time and never leaks. Love it! By the way, it is a steamer and gets very hot pay attention to your hand placement. I recommend.",

(Love these curtains, btw.) The curtains are thick and lined for thermal/blackout. To my surprise, this steamer quickly smoothed out the deep creases!I\u2019m giving this 5 stars despite the 6\u2019 cord being a little short, IMO, because it was SIXTEEN DOLLARS! Another nitpick of mine is it would be nice if I didn\u2019t have to hold the button down the entire time while using it. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t need to use it for so long though. I had six 52\u201dX108\u201d curtains to steam so my hand got cramped. I used a rubber-band to hold it down. I can definitely see the need to hold the button while in use as a safety feature so I\u2019m not going to knock off a star\u2026IT WAS $16! lolWould definitely purchase again and recommend!",

After seeing my dissatisfied review, they reached out and offered to replace it or reimburse me for my purchase, up to me - my choice. I didn't ask for that, as it was long past my Amazon return window. I opted for a replacement, as the steamer worked great on my first trip, prior to the unexpected issue -- I received the replacement quickly and have it packed for my upcoming trip. Thank you - A very satisfied customer!Do Not Buy this steamer.A fantastic concept - portable, fast heat up, easy to use but while it worked well on my vacation at the end of 2022. 2023 summer vacation 6 months later - 2nd use, plugged it in and was met with only a buzzing noise, no steam. 1x use is unacceptable - don't buy.",

However, stopped working the next time I went to use it. The whole unit becomes extreme hot to touch, no sound (as if motor isn't working) and no steam. Thankfully I'm still in return window. So opted to have steamer replaced instead of my money back and keeping my fingers crossed that the replacement one works more than one time.",
