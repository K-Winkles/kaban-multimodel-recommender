                "reviewText": "The Waitbird steam cleaner is an amazing multipurpose steamer with so many different uses. I researched different steamers for 2 months and finally went with purchasing this one because of the reviews and affordable price. One of the biggest reasons that I purchased this steamer was for the quality of the product and the adjustable output strength option to enhance the use for what I am cleaning without damaging the surface. I found that many other steamers did not have the same adjustable feature and ease of use; and this is an excellent feature to allow you to clean different surfaces from tile, to furniture to car upholstery.I have used the Waitbird to deep clean my showers taking away heavy dirt build up and it works amazing. I love that I don\u2019t have to use any chemicals and the results are incredible. I have saved so much money not having to buy expensive cleaners.It\u2019s also very effective when cleaning my car upholstery and carpets after the kids bring in mud or dirt from their sporting activities.The beauty of this tool is that the pressurized steam is ready rather quick; I have read that other steamers could take up to 7-10 minutes. In addition, the provided attachments are a great value add and allow to clean in different use cases.Finally, the product craftsmanship and quality is top tier; once you open the box, you will realize how well the steamer is made with very durable material.Thank you Waitbird for an amazing steamer and I am so very happy with this product. I have told all my family and friends about it and 4 of them have already purchased one.",

                "reviewText": "The waitbird steamer is amazing. I ordered it primarily to clean decades old grime from the grout in our tile floor. It performs beautifully! I have also used it to clean appliances and the baked on film that covered the oven door! One tank of water lasts about 45 minutes...about all the cleaning I want to do at one time. But it heats the water quickly and so longer projects are no problem. It is lightweight and maneuverable. It comes with various attachments that make the waitbird effective for all types of cleaning. It is easy to use and light weight. It is one of the best purchases I have made",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to use this machine a couple times before I could leave a review and I couldn't be more pleased. I've been looking at ways to reduce chemical cleaners both for the environment and, more importantly, my children sake. I heard about steam cleaners and some of the very, very pricey options were just outside of my reach. This one not only does the job, but I feel like it's a long-term solution that is beneficial in many ways. It heats up quickly. I had no problem understanding the directions on how to assemble and use. I actually got impatient and tried to open the safety valve before the pressure had properly released and it wouldn't let me! I loved that the designers added this safety feature.Finally, I wish I would have taken a Before & After picture of one project. Namely the bathroom sink. I have used all kinds of things to attempt to clean out our sink and nothing seemed to work. 2 minutes with this cleaner and problem solved.Would highly recommend!",

The steam could be stronger, but for the basics of steam cleaning this does a job well done with little to no elbow grease. Great for those hard to reach areas and if you have boys\u2026around the toilet base this is a MUST! Overall great product, with simple instructions, if you want a budget steam cleaner with the extras: this is the one!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been eyeing a steam cleaner for months now. I specifically was debating on buying the little white box one all over tik tok. I decided to wait until Black Friday to make my final decision and I really wasn\u2019t happy with the discount they were offering for it. I decided I was going to compare to other steamers on Amazon. AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! This baby was WORTH IT! This WaitBird was nearly half off on Black Friday. It\u2019s already $70 bucks cheaper than the white box brand at regular price. I was initially hesitant of buying the WaitBird because there wasn\u2019t a bunch of video reviews on \u201cclean-tok\u201d. I\u2019m sure there will be now!Let me set the scene for you. We just moved into an older and not remodeled home. We are planning to remodel sometime next year and didn\u2019t want to spend a bunch of money quite yet. The prior owner had been developing dementia and owned some dogs. Well, they didn\u2019t always make it outside to potty. Hence the hard to remove stains\u2026 We also have 3 dogs who have tracked in quite a bit of dirt and mud from outside. Our house came with a carpet shampooer and it has not done much to the stains or the dinginess in the carpets.So on to the actual review of the WaitBird! There are many attachments for the steamer. I have currently only used the floor attachment but can\u2019t wait to use it on the old appliances and windows. The floor attachment can be used with any microfiber cloth but does come with 2 in the box. The clips on the floor attachment were fantastic. I was afraid they would fall off but nope! The cloth stayed on the entire time!I did cleaned the 3 of the dirtiest carpeted rooms in our house (~1,000 sq ft) in 6 hours. I did put some hard work into the floors and was not an easy chore. I also cleaned the parquet in the hallway which it did fantastic on. I probably filled up the tank 10-12 times. I had the steam on the highest setting and it ran about 30 to 35 mins each time. It only took 5 mins to warm up each time and I wish it took longer as that\u2019s when I took my \u201cunion breaks\u201d.The unit itself is compact and easy to store! It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. I find the look of it to be retro and simply adorable. Yellow is not my favorite color; however, we decided to name ours Sunshine for fun :)Overall, definitely worth the money! I don\u2019t believe it was made to be professional grade but it does the Lord\u2019s work. We plan to use it on the old appliances left with the house, the windows, and I read that it could possibly help with removing the ungodly amount of wallpaper in the house! I also read that steamers are better to use when sterilizing than using chemicals (aka kids school germs). I\u2019ll update as I use on more things.Enjoy the before and after pictures. I didn\u2019t feel the need to label the pictures with before or after since there was such a drastic difference.My best advice is JUST BUY IT!",

I needed a steamer that I could use primarily to steam my bed, chairs and baseboards. I've unfortunately moved into an apartment building with a history of bed bugs and got hit with an infestation just as I moved in. The exterminator told me this steamer was a perfect choice and would help kill bedbug eggs and the bugs itself on direct contact. I've used it not only on furniture but floor boards, quilts, clothing, mirrors, tiles and floor itself. The tank holds a good amount of water so I can get alot done. Changing attachments is really easy. It let's out a lot of steam and is doing a fantastic job keeping my place sanitary and gives me peace of mind. I just keep it and all the attachments in a tote box. I highly recommend this steamer it's been money well spent.",
