                "reviewText": "I had been shopping the local cleaners to a location that was experienced in dry cleaning lined drapes. The drapes are very special to me therefore I wanted realiable professionally dry cleaner. I wanted to clean them before hanging them but unfortunately it wasn't as easy to locate a trustworthy location as it use to be. Fortunately dry cleaning being them could be postponed and was more of a choice than a need. Unfortunately the weeks they spend stuffed in a bag caused wrinkles that wouldn't just fall out from just hanging them. I decided to search for a steamer, after searching reviews I purchased this one. I am pleasantly surprised in how well it worked. I was able to steam them without taking them back down. The only issue is the water reservoir is very small so it runs out fast and the instructions stressed you must wait for it to cool before refilling so even smaller projects still will take extra time. Still I gave the product 5 stars because of the end results, being so small the price could be a little better but the plus in the size is that it's not too heavy to handle. I would refer this item.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this two days before a trip to a bridal shower I had to travel to. I called the hotel in advance to see if there was a clothes steamer on-site, and was informed that there was not, only the standard ironing board and iron. I decided to purchase this one and hope for the best as I hate ironing and always have wrinkled clothes when I travel. It was relatively easy to travel with. I had it in the side pocket of a duffel bag, which I carried onto the plane.Thoughts: This worked really well! It took all the wrinkles out of my dresses in minutes along with the shirts I had folded but got shifted during travel causing those pesky wrinkles.The only con is that the water from the steamer evaporated into steam very quickly (maybe 10-15 mins of steam), and the instructions state that you must turn off the unit after the water is evaporated and wait until cool down to refill the vessel. I was able to do one long dress before it ran out and then I let it cool down throughout the day and refilled the vessel to steam two other shirts before it again ran out of steam.But overall I\u2019m happy with the product. It did a great job for what I needed it to do!",

                "reviewText": "Update:We had the steamer for about a month now and as we've tried it on different clothing materials we realized it doesn't work as well on specific types of material such as Nylong. It also takes a lot longer to stream things than our previous steamer. We ended up returning the item.Previous Review:We got this as our old travel steamer broke due to wattage issues. We took this on a trip with us recently and the steamer works very well and removes wrinkles fairly fast. It also doesn't leave those water spots that can sometimes occur with steamers.Just a heads up, this model is a bit bigger than the one we had previously - not so much so that it's hard to travel with but it does take up more space than we're used to. It also weights a bit more.",

                "reviewText": "Escribo esta rese\u00f1a r\u00e1pidamente despu\u00e9s de apenas 1 uso, primera vez en mi vida que uso este tipo de productos: CUMPLE SU FUNCI\u00d3N.No es un reemplazo completo de una plancha, pero s\u00ed que ayuda a quitar gran parte de las arrugas. Es bastante f\u00e1cil de usar: abres arriba la boquilla, le echas un poco de agua, la enchufas, enciendes y en 1 minuto ya est\u00e1 generando vapor.Toma m\u00e1s tiempo y pasadas que una plancha regular, pero no requiere la tabla ni tanto aparataje. Es bastante peque\u00f1a como para poder llevarla de viaje, y suficientemente potente como para usarla en casa.Opino que es es casi esencial usar un guante de planchado, que afortunadamente compr\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n (misma marca Conair) o de lo contrario es f\u00e1cil quemarse porque el vapor sale sumamente caliente.En mi primer uso, rellen\u00e9 en total 2 veces el dep\u00f3sito de agua para planchar la camisa blanca que aparece en la foto, pero definitivamente creo que es cuesti\u00f3n de acostumbrarse y aprender a usar eficientemente el vapor. El pantal\u00f3n que aparece en la segunda imagen es grueso y de mezclilla y solo us\u00e9 1 rellenada de agua.En promedio creo que uno toma 15 minutos en desarrugar ropa tan arrugada como la que aparece en las fotos. El mejor lugar que encontr\u00e9 en casa para planchar es en el tubo de la ducha (disculpen el desorden). Si pones la ropa en una puerta corres el riesgo de da\u00f1ar la puerta con el calor o ensuciar la ropa. Seg\u00fan lo que veo, es solo para uso vertical (y para esto, nuevamente el guante de planchado ayuda mucho).Para la cantidad de ropa que plancho, definitivamente es una buena opci\u00f3n. SI planchas toda tu ropa y e eres muy mani\u00e1tico con las arrugas, tal vez es mejor opci\u00f3n comprar una plancha normal, con su tabla. La ventaja es que el tratamiento de vapor evita que deje algunos tipos de tela con brillo y adem\u00e1s sirve para quitar arrugas en sacos o abrigos.",
