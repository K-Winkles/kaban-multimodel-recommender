                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Such a handy little device to keep around in your closet for quick de-wrinkling!",
                "reviewText": "First of all it's a very compact, small little device, that's quickly and easily set up. The top twists on and off with a locking feature and is very secure while being very easy to twist. People with hand issues shouldn't have much trouble with removing the nozzle in order to fill it. The reservoir is small enough that it should fit under the faucet of your bathroom sink no problem. We have fairly shallow sinks and I was able to fill it without an issue. The opening is large and easily filled without spilling water all over the steamer. Do note, however, that due to it's very compact size you will only be able to put enough water in it to one garment at a time.The unit heats up quickly (under 2 minutes) and makes a little gurgling noise that will let you know that it's ready. There was not a lot of visible steam coming from it, but it steamed up the mirror above my vanity and I knew it was ready. Steaming was easy, though I did have to hold it very close, if not on the shirt. I was able to \"press\" a nice crease in the silk fabric very easily. Steaming the very bottom of the shirt was a little difficult just because it was hard to hold tension on it while it was hanging without burning my fingers from the steam. The steam is hot, however, I feel that it was a little conservative (likely to prevent people from burning themselves) I would have appreciated it being a little hotter, because it think it would have helped the process move a little more quickly. I did have to go over some more wrinkled areas a few times to get the wrinkles out. Overall, though, wrinkles came out of the shirt fairly quickly and very easily. Just a tip: Hold it very close, possibly touching the garment, for best results.Just know -- this is NOT an iron. You're of course going to get better results with an iron. But for materials that you don't want to risk scorching, or just because who wants to drag out the iron and ironing board at 5 in the morning, this is a great alternative. I was able to steam the wrinkles out of this silk shirt in about 2-3 minutes - way less than the time it would have taken me to set up an ironing board and iron. I also used this little steamer to fix a scrunched up tassel necklace. Worked super quickly (like 10 seconds) and my necklace is like brand new!All in all: A great little steamer. Super convenient to have on hand for quick de-wrinkling jobs. Works very well and will keep you from those lazy morning wrinkles. Tank is small (though on purpose) and steam is not as hot as I would like, perhaps, but is hot enough to press a crease in light fabrics such as silk. Great little addition to your clothing care arsenal!",

                "reviewText": "I own a shop that sells vintage clothing and the garments are often made of quite delicate fabric. Dealing with vintage clothing, I prefer to launder all of our garments - which often leaves them very wrinkled. This is quite a dilemma because ironing delicate vintage pieces is simply not worth the risk!So far I\u2019ve used this little powerhouse of a steamer on a very high quality 100% nylon jersey 1960\u2019s maxi dress (the same fabric type used by iconic 1960\u2019s designers such as Emilio Pucci), a 1950\u2019s style floor length acetate blend ball gown with a very full skirt and an intricately embroidered 100% cotton 1970\u2019s kaftan.Honestly, I could not possibly be more pleased with the results! I was very careful, spending quite a bit of time and attention steaming these pieces. Each of them came out perfectly without a wrinkle in sight - and I am not exaggerating! Per the directions I have and will continue using distilled water and while the capacity of the water tank isn\u2019t very large, with a bottle of distilled water nearby refilling it quickly is easy as can be.Also, as the directions state, do not fill it past the marked maximum fill line - as it will spit out boiling hot water. If you do mistakenly overfill it - just put it on a towel for a minute or less and once it reaches the maximum fill line it will stop spitting out water. For my use it is the perfect size - small enough to discreetly store when it is not in use and though I do not travel frequently I imagine it would be great for that use as well!",
