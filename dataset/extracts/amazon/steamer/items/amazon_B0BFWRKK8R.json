Not the most powerful thing so definitely takes some time and working to unwrinkle. It\u2019s a nice price, but not what I had hoped to get out of it.",

                "reviewText": "So I have two other handheld garment steamers and I hate them. I ordered this one half expecting to not like it either, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I steamed two 4x8 blackout curtain panels and two valances in about 20 mins. The steamer held enough water to run for close to 12 minutes, which did 1 curtain and 1 valance. The initial heat time was 1 min 45 sec, when already hot each refill took about 1 min 15 sec to heat.After I knocked out the curtains, I steamed 2 of my husband's long sleeved shirts, 6 child t-shirts (some not pictured) and a pair of child's pants in roughly 10 mins, and 1 tank of water. The shirts and pants had spent about 24 hours in the dryer and were very very wrinkled. This is hands down the best steamer I have tried.Cons:When the water level gets to about 1/4 inch, it violently bubbles and will spew large globs of hot water. Avoidable by keeping an eye on the water level, but inconvenient and a burn hazard.You cannot tilt it forward very far, depending on water level, or it will spill out the nozzle.",
