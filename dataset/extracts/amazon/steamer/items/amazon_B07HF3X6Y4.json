Always check the care label for ironing compatibility and temperature suggestions. Ideal fabrics for steaming include cotton, linens, and certain synthetic fabrics like polyester. Exercise caution when steaming delicate fabrics such as wool, silk, chiffon, and velvet, and do not use a brush attachment. Check the care instructions and consider steaming from the underside of the fabric. Additionally, waxed jackets, suede, and materials prone to melting, like plastic, leather, or dry-clean-only items, should not be steamed. Note: Please note that this product only use in 110-120V countries and regions such as the US, Canada, Japan. So We recommend that please do not use Hilife garment steamer in countries over 110 volts. If you use our products under 220V-240V voltage, the product will be burned immediately and cannot be used.",

Plug in the steamer. When the light on your device turns on and steam is produced, it\u2019s ready to go. 3. Hold the garment taut from the bottom and gently work your way up and down, section by section. Keep the steamer's nozzle moving; avoid leaving it in one spot. When steaming, never turn the unit upside down or tilt it past a 45-degree angle. 4. After steaming, allow your garment to dry and settle before wearing it to prevent wrinkles from reappearing. For stubborn wrinkles, steam over the area for up to 30 seconds, allowing steam to relax the garment fibers, releasing wrinkles and odors. Steaming Precaution: Avoid holding the steamer too tightly to prevent creating new creases. Should You Use Distilled Water or Tap Water? Always check the manufacturer's instructions for your garment steamer. If specified, use distilled water. If you live in an area with hard water, it is recommended that you use distilled water. Hard water can leave mineral deposits, visible as white flakes and potentially cause machine clogging. If you live in an area with regular water, you can fill up your steamer with tap water. NOTE: *Please do not add water over the Max water line. *Never turn the unit upside down or tilted your steamer past a 45-degree angle. *Never use the steamer on clothes that you are wearing on yourself. *For perfect use-please use a hanger to hang your clothes while steaming.",

                "reviewText": "When I made my buy, I did not take the time to read the reviews or even consider the advantages and disadvantages of the product. I wanted to try it, and I saw this one, and it was reasonably priced, so I only thought twice before purchasing. This steamer would be a good investment for people like me who do their laundry to ensure few wrinkles; however, no matter how hard you try, you will always have a wrinkle here and there. And this steamer is small but works miracles when it comes to those tiny wrinkles. It is travel friendly, easy to store, and compact. I am satisfied with the purchase because I knew it was something other than what I would use daily. There are instances when a minor crease in my clothing makes me lazy about getting out the iron and performing all that extra work. I did not need it for anything significant, in other words. I was excited to try it when it arrived, so I did. At first, I was frightened because there did not appear to be any steam coming out, but after 3 minutes, I saw smoke, so I recommend giving it some time after being plugged in to get it operating. I had never used a steamer before and was highly pleased. It contains enough water to complete at least one outfit. To avoid water spurting out, don't fill it up. Be cautioned not to put your hands or skin too close to the blue nozzle because this machine part gets hot. Despite being portable and simple, I tried a steamer because it doesn't leave wrinkles and lines like an iron. And just as expected, the steam did wonders for me in removing wrinkles. I also used the included brush, which worked equally effectively both ways. Although it works wonders, I would not suggest it to someone who plans to use it frequently because it is time-consuming and doesn't work as well on oversized clothing. This isn't to say that it doesn't work, just that you must review it a few times to get it to look exactly right. However, this is ideal if you're looking for something inexpensive, convenient for storage, and simple to use. Remember that it works best on smaller clothes because it will take less water, and you can get a lot done with one full cup. If you wanted to steam more than one piece of clothing at a time, you would have to stop often, turn the machine off, and let it cool down for a few minutes before adding more water and plugging it back in, and then wait another three minutes for the steam to resume. It has undoubtedly been put to use and has been helpful on numerous occasions. Getting wrinkle-free clothing has become necessary for travel and daily life. The functionality of this product is excellent, given its size and cost. The product heats up quickly and is a perfectly manageable size. Use filtered or purified water to avoid limescale buildup that could damage equipment and stain garments. Although it removes wrinkles rapidly, it cannot replace ironing. The product is excellent overall, and I suggest it unless you plan to use it frequently for formal attire because doing so requires a lot of time. But don't let it deter you from purchasing it. I'm sure you will love it as much as I do and will use it extensively. People like me who take their time with their laundry to ensure minimal wrinkles would benefit from investing in this steamer. Despite our best efforts, there will inevitably be a few wrinkles here and there.",

It came as described with a generous measuring cup, 2 brush attachments, and a user's manual. All items are very sturdy, great quality. In particular, the electric cord is heavy duty and very long as advertised.It only took 130 seconds for the water to boil, exactly as decribed in the user's guide.The steam is hot and strong enough to do the job. I did a trial test on a heavy cotton dish towel and it immediately removed all the wrinkles.I would recommend this steamer, I think it is well made and comes with a 2-year warranty.Also it was delivered in 4 hours, my first \"same day\" delivery. Very Impressive!",

                "reviewText": "Follow the instructions closely. It's very easy. At first it doesn't seem that there is anything happening. It doesn't emit a lot of visible steam. But it works fantastically. Takes about 30-40 seconds to heat up. Just go up and down on your fabric and your wrinkles disappear quite quickly. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This worked well on my heavy blackout curtains. I was so excited to hang them that I neglected to press them properly. I used this to steam the wrinkles out. This did not work as well as an iron would have, but it took the wrinkles out and now they look presentable. It helps if you can pull the fabric taught while steaming the item. The cord was long enough for me to work from the top of 8 foot curtains down to the floor. Seeing how well this worked on the heavy fabric of curtains, I believe this would be very effective on clothes on the hanger.This heats up in about 1 minute to boil the water, and obviously the steam and water are very hot. It has a small reservoir that I had to refill four times, but I steamed three large sets of curtains. Do not overfill the reservoir because when the water boils, it will shoot the boiling water out of the steam holes if there is too much water.",

No la he usado para viajar, pero su tama\u00f1o lo permitir\u00eda sin ning\u00fan problema y la velocidad de planchado permite que no se desperdicie nada de tiempo en dejar la ropa lista para usarse.
