                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Bissell SteamShot Hard Surface Steam Cleaner for my wife, and I have to say, I haven't seen her this excited about a cleaning tool in a long time. It's become a staple in our household cleaning routine, and for good reason. The only minor hiccup has been with the attachments, but more on that later.Exceptional Cleaning Performance:The Bissell SteamShot has exceeded our expectations in terms of cleaning performance. My wife is thrilled with how it effortlessly tackles dirt, grime, and stains on various surfaces. It\u2019s amazing to see how it sanitizes without the need for harsh chemicals, relying solely on the power of steam. She's particularly fond of using it in the kitchen and bathroom, where it cuts through grease and soap scum like a charm.Ease of Use:She can't stop talking about how user-friendly and convenient the SteamShot is. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver, making the dreaded chore of cleaning less of a hassle. The steam trigger allows for precise control, and the fact that it heats up quickly means she can get to cleaning without any annoying wait times.Natural Sanitization:We have young kids, so using natural methods to sanitize our home is a priority. The SteamShot's ability to clean with just water, transforming it into a powerful cleaning agent, gives us peace of mind. We're reducing our chemical usage without compromising on cleanliness.Versatility for Multiple Surfaces:Another aspect my wife loves is its versatility. Whether it's tile, hardwood, or laminate, the SteamShot works wonders across various hard surfaces, leaving them spotless and streak-free.The Only Downside - Attachments:The only downside, if I had to mention one, is the attachments that come with the product. While they are functional, my wife feels they could be more durable and offer a bit more variety to tackle different types of cleaning tasks more effectively.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Bissell SteamShot Hard Surface Steam Cleaner has been a fantastic addition to our home. Its effectiveness, ease of use, and natural cleaning capability have made it a hit, especially with my wife. While the attachments could see some improvement, the overall performance of this steam cleaner makes it a product we'd happily recommend to anyone looking for an efficient and chemical-free way to clean their home.",

                "reviewText": "We had some mold and mildew issues, along with soap scum, in our walk-in shower. We had used several bottled cleaners but they just didn't work. So we sprung for this great little handheld steamer. It is about the half the size of a gallon of milk and very light weight, yet well constructed. It came with multiple extension brushes and and a nice long extension chord, about 10' I guess.The unit is easy to fill. Just push down on the cap and unscrew then fill the little cup that comes with it to the black line. Then pour that into the steamer. Screw the lid on tightly - but not too tight or it will be difficult to get back off.Then plug it in and it heats up to steam pressure in about 5 minutes. A little orange light will come on when its ready. We used the grout cleaning brush and simply scrubbed the grout while releasing some steam every few seconds. It did a great job cleaning the grout. Got all the mold/mildew off and looks like new.The chaulking at the bottome of the tub was worse, however. And the steamer was unable to remove it. So I had to rechaulk that area.It did get the soap scum off the plastic shower floor but it was a lot of work - significant scrubbing strength required. So we'll not use it for that again. But we did have quite a bit of buildup so I think a more powerful steamer with different brushes would have worked.Our overall feeling is that this is a great little steamer. We love it - easy to use and handle. We're keeping it and going to use it for cleaning our stove top, wheel rims, upholestery, etc. Plus tile grout again when needed.This is a great tool to invest in. Highly recommend the Bissel handheld steamer.",

                "reviewText": "This little steamer is amazing. I recently steamed the kitchen floor and I never thought the ground in grease and dirt that had been there for over a decade would come out, bit this little steamer steamed it all the way. The only thing I would have liked was a larger reservoir so you didn't need to refill as often. I was usually able to clean about 4 tiles before I had to refill and depending on the severity, it could go down to only 1, or 2 tiles. Even though you need to refill it a lot, it is well worth it. I would highly recommend this product.",
