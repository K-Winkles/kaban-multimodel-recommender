I read through the instructions and it says it will begin to steam once it senses it\u2019s not on a flat surface. Held it at an angle for over two minutes and nothing.

I tested it on a wrinkled linen shirt and I don't think that shirt has ever looked better. I also used it in the horizontal position to steam my mattress and pillows, and it did just great - not a leak in sight. Now to decide if I should give away my ironing board as well. It's too big for traveling tho, in my opinion.*UPDATE - after just a couple of weeks, unit began sputtering and leaving lots of big wet spots on my clothing, even when used vertically. Contacted Conair directly and the woman suggested I descale it by filling the chamber with a 50/50 solution of water and white vinegar, then let it steam vertically for a while. Did that and now it's back to working perfectly. Hadn't seen that tip anywhere.",

Was very skeptical on how effective it would be, there were many brands to try from but I went for a name brand that I know than trying some weird names. It is perfect, I don\u2019t think I will ever have to iron anymore. It takes seconds to start working i just steam my clothes and within seconds ur ready to go. I didn\u2019t honestly use any of the other attachments but it does the job for me.Update: a while into using this and it started spraying water all over the clothes, its like no steam comes out anymore just really hot water. Such a disappointment I really liked it when it worked, back to my old iron I guess!!!Update: after some research turns out it just needed cleaning, all it needed was add some vinegar and water to it and turn it on, let it work till all the water is steamed and voil\u00e0 its back to functioning normal. Obviously this was a step needed every now and then, read about it before but for some reason couldn\u2019t think that spitting out water means it needs cleaning. Still rocks! I am back in love!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased the Conair 2-in-1 Handheld Steamer and Iron with high hopes of efficiently steaming and ironing my clothes. However, my experience with this product has been quite disappointing due to one major flaw: water leakage.From the moment I started using it, I noticed water bursting out of the steam vents, leaving my clothes damp and in need of rewashing. This issue completely defeats the purpose of having a steamer and iron combo, as it only adds unnecessary steps to my garment care routine.I have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the manual, including checking the water tank and adjusting the temperature, but the leakage problem persists. It is frustrating and time-consuming to constantly wipe down my clothes and surfaces to prevent water stains.Moreover, the water leakage poses a risk of damaging delicate fabrics, as it may leave watermarks or cause discoloration. It\u2019s disheartening to spend money on a product that not only fails to deliver its promises but also creates additional problems.While I appreciate the convenience of having a 2-in-1 device, the consistent water leakage issue overshadows any benefits it may offer. I had expected better quality and performance from a reputable brand like Conair.I would strongly caution potential buyers who are considering this product. Unless Conair addresses and resolves the water leakage problem, I cannot recommend the Conair 2-in-1 Handheld Steamer and Iron for Clothes. It\u2019s a regrettable purchase that fails to live up to expectations and leaves clothes wet instead of well-pressed.",

I tried everything but it\u2019s simply not working . Unfortunately I can\u2019t even return it because due to my busy schedule I never opened it for over a month which is a mistake on my part . The conclusion is to always use the product immediately after delivery because it might be faulty and you would have to return it .",
