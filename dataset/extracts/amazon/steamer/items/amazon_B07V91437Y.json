                "reviewText": "Took it to New Zealand for 3 weeks. Used it several times, loved how fast it gets ready (less than 40 seconds), the small water reservoir (yes, I actually think smaller is better in this case for portability), and that it works with both 110/220V outlets. Only two minor nits. First, the AC voltage is selected via a manual switch on the bottom of the unit - wish it could auto-sense the voltage instead. If you leave it on 110V and plug it into a 220V outlet (say, in NZ), I suppose the unit might fry (dunno for sure). Also, when we returned to USA, I forgot about the switch and when I went to use it, it failed. After a few minutes I realized the issue, flipped the switch back to 110VAC and all was good again. The second nit is the small water reservoir. It's good enough for one, maybe two shirts depending on their size/material. Perfect for travel, but some may get annoyed that they need to refill the reservoir once or twice. It pops out for refilling very easily (just pull straight out with two fingers), so it's really no big deal. Really a great product, will be traveling with us many more times.",

I can steam things on a board or while hanging up and get good results, even on linen. It's so easy to use and store that I whip it out when I don't feel like lugging out the ironing board. It's amazing how simple it is to look great when it's really easy and quick! It heats up very quickly and has a large reservoir for water. It's probably too bulky to pack (unless you're checking luggage) but I love it for home use.",

                "reviewText": "Great steamer, heats up fast and steams garments very well! I did run into an issue when I tried to use it for the first time. I plugged in the steamer and let it heat up, and once it was ready, I pressed the \u2018Steam\u2019 button but nothing was happening. I could tell the steamer was hot and I had filled the tank properly, however no steam was coming out. I called the Conair helpline and the rep was super helpful and informed me of what I needed to do to get it to work, and I was able to get it working in 5 min!If you run into this problem, here is what you need to do:- plug in steamer and ensure the water tank is full- allow it to heat up and when it lights up red to let you know it\u2019s ready, press the \u2018Steam\u2019 button- then turn the entire steamer upside down, and hold it that way for a bit- flip it back and forth, sideways and upside down, to help loosen the air bubble that is blocking the steam- you should eventually here it trying to work, keep holding it upside down and flipping it around (carefully), and the steam will soon come out!****hope this helps!! :)",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, that took a while given that the water chamber is intentionally small, but it does a great job and the voltage adapts for international use. In terms of every day use, the tank holds enough to steam a blouse and trousers and it heats up really fast. I can\u2019t recommend it enough!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not clear on the directions on how to use",
                "reviewText": "My wife wanted one of these portable steamers to take on our vacation. She settled on this. I could not figure this out at first but finally got the hang of it.Follow the directions on filling the little water tank. Turn on (button on the bottom) and wait until the blue light stops blinking. Once it stops blinking, you will see the 5 levels (in red). I use only 3 so press the setting button until you see 3 red lights or to whatever level you like. What was confusing was the actual Steam button. I thought you had to hold the button while steaming but you don't. You press once for the steam to actually come out. Press again to have the steam stop. However, there is no indication that the actual steaming process is on. Yes, you have to turn it on using the power button but it will not steam until you press the Steam button. Also the instructions stating it takes 30 or 40 seconds to heat the water. It takes more like 1-2 minutes. Once it is heated, press the Steam button and the steam will come out (be careful as it burns). Then you can start steaming your clothing item.If you have a large clothing item or multiple items, the water tank will run out so you will need to refill. It will let you know that the water ran out once it starts making noise.I use the brush attachment which seems to help. Just make sure to attach it prior to turning on the unit because the face will get hot even if you have not press the Steam button.Overall, it does work. We used it multiple times so far and no issues. Just the first time trying to figure out as I did not know you have to press the Steam button once to actually have the steam come out. I thought you had to hold it.Also don't steam your clothing item against a door or wall. The steam will go through the clothing and may damage your door or wall. Also I believe you only should use it upright. It may not work if you are steaming horizontal.The steamer is a decent size so don't think it is small. Check the dimensions as it is pretty big but we should put it in our suitcase. I do recommend this. Let's see how durable it is.",
