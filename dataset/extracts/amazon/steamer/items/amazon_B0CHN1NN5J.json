I got it on sale because this is my first handheld steamer and I wasn't sure I'd like it, but this is worth full price. It heats up super quickly, works extremely well, and goes pretty far on a single tank of water. I needed to refill it between sets of curtains, but the first set is basically floor to ceiling. The left side of the beige curtains is steamed, the right side isn't. I'm honestly shocked I got these results without having to lay the curtains down on a solid surface.It got a little heavy after steaming four curtains, but not overly so. This would certainly be too heavy for someone with muscular degeneration, but should be fine for someone with average upper arm strength.",

I love the dry iron and ability to steam on flat surface as well as hanging. It heats up fast, and lasts a long time 15/20 minutes straight before needing to refill the water. I\u2019ve tried a couple other steamers and this one has been my favorite by far!",
