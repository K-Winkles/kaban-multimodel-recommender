The steamer is pretty lightweight and it's compact in size making it great for use when travelling or at home as it will ot take much space. The quality is really good and the performance is even better. I was totally ready to be disappointed (I've purchased others before) and instead I was pleasantly surprised.",

I\u2019m not sure if I would recommend it for traveling if you\u2019re flying, as it does still take up a bit of room, but for traveling by car or something, it would be perfect. Highly recommend.

                "reviewText": "This steamer works super well! It heats up really fast and works great. The only thing I'd say is to only use it on small projects. We were steaming a small cloth and it did run out of water quickly because it's so small. I wouldn't steam a wedding dress with this, for example. But it's great to have around the house for a quick steam before you leave.",

Also try to keep the steamer vertical. If you tip it close to 90 degrees the boiling water will spill out.",
