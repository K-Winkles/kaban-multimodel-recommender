                "reviewText": "This looks like an American Girl doll toy at first; it's so compact and the lavender with gold trim is just... really cute! It does not hold a lot of water, but the water cup provided helps you 1) know how much it can hold and 2) it has a pinched out pouring lip that helps get in in without a mess. It started making a nice, consistent, steam in 10 SECONDS! I compared this to my full-size Conair steamer, and it worked just as well. It doesn't last as long between refills, but hey, it's a TRAVEL steamer. There was no sputtering, and the steam was not drippy or wet. Turn off the steam, and it stays hot and is used as an iron! (You need to unplug this to fully power off.) It even has a nifty little beak at the front to get into corners and around buttons a bit, and it has a tray with silicone supports to rest it on while hot. I left it there awhile and nothing melted. I love how compact it is when folded up. I did find that the water tank plug wanted to pop out and leak if I didn't push it in place very firmly. I think this would be awesome for travel, or for a dorm for kids who don't need to iron much!",

It was exactly the advertised weight which is noticeably heavier than my travel garment steamer, (all plastic). However, this will actually iron, not just steam, so it is more versatile for items that need a \u201csharp\u201d press adding only about a half a pound more. It works just like a mini iron. I only use distilled water in it to keep it clean. Overall a nice little iron for travel.",

This may work for some with its compact size but I am much too busy to be constantly refilling it to just get thru one shirt.The color and the weight of this is very nice. It steam irons very well.

It feels better with the handle rotated out and away from the iron body. The little cup is marked to 80ml but the iron says it takes 100ml. Not a problem though. It heats up really fast and is ready to go in under 20 seconds. WOW. The hot iron temp is just around 320deg. and when steaming, it drops to about 240deg. The iron bottom coating appears to be like that on some frying pans and seams to be good quality. I was even impressed with the electric cord having a isolated shielded covering. I did use distilled water in it and when finished put the remaining water back in the jug for next time. My test video was on a pair of wrinkled Levis to see how tough it is. I give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This Enemupa portable iron isn't just a travel companion, it's a wrinkle-wrestling warrior! Forget bulky beasts that hog suitcase space, this little dynamo packs a powerful punch in a pint-sized package. Steaming shirts? Smoothing scarves? Defeating denim creases? This iron tackles them all with the ferocity of a miniature dragon (minus the fire, thankfully).Small but Mighty:Don't underestimate its size. This iron heats up like a champ, unleashing a steamy torrent that rivals its full-sized brethren. It dances across fabrics, banishing wrinkles like a magician vanishing pigeons (though hopefully your clothes stay put!).User-Friendly, with a Side of Mystery:Navigating this iron is a breeze. It's ergonomic, comfortable to hold, and glides over garments like a seasoned ice skater. Just be prepared for a mini-adventure with the instructions. Tiny font can feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics, but thankfully, the pictures offer helpful clues (though the \"pure water\" enigma remains unsolved \u2013 distilled water seems to do the trick!).Power with Precautions:This iron's heat and steam are like a superhero's powers \u2013 great for good, but handle with care! Delicate fabrics might need a superhero sidekick in the form of a protective cloth. And like any powerful tool, unattended use requires caution. Set a timer, be vigilant, and remember, great power comes with great responsibility (for your clothes, at least).From Skeptic to Steam Fan:Despite the teeny-tiny instructions and the lack of fabric-specific settings, this Enemupa iron won me over. It's compact, powerful, and gets the job done beautifully. So, if you're looking for a wrinkle-busting travel buddy or a space-saving sidekick for your home arsenal, give this little steamer a try. You might just find yourself converted, like I did, from skeptic to steam-powered enthusiast!",
