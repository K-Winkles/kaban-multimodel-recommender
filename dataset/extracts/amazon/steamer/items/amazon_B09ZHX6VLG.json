Warm Tips: There is No trigger on handbar, please turn off the power switch if want to stop steaming. It is a high-temperature steam cleaning machine, please do not touch the metal nozzle, do not touch the steam, do not spary at human, pets or the device itself. If the distance from the nozzle is farther, the temperature will be lower, so please put the nozzle close to the surface of the object to be cleaned, the cleaning will be more effective. If worried about accidentally touching the hot nozzle or steam, you can wear heat-resistant gloves, but gloves will make the cleaning process inconvenient, please use it carefully. When cleaning glass products, avoid bursting due to uneven heating. Recommended to be used by adults aged 25~60 who has the physical and mental ability to operate the machine normally. During work, the item needs to remain connected to the power and continue to heat, in order to keep steaming.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this unit holds 3.5 cups of water giving you alot of steam before refilling the reservoir, and easy to refill holding tank is not under pressure. Using the wand and the steam hose is so much better than my old handheld, you can direct the steam in any direction without holding the whole unit. I already used it to clean gunk off my glass top stove and it did that without any effort. Used it in the shower to clean soap scum and grout lines. At first it worked but was alot of work, but when I applied a soap scum remover and then steamed it off - great results and easy. Attachments are useful. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that you can't control the steam flow only way to stop it is to turn the machine off. Handle does get hot after a while, as others have noted. Overall a useful tool better than my last one that you had to hold the whole unit to direct the steam.",

                "reviewText": "Originally wanted to steam 12 years of wear and tare off my kitchen wood cabinet doors, but for a first test I cleaned up 15 years worth of caked on dirt and grime from my old Hoover industrial vacuum canister and hepa filter container screen. It came out spotless and looking like new! With the extension pipe I got into nooks and crannies I never would have reached with just my hand. Stuff I probably would've ended up scratching the plastic trying to get clean. Took a moment to get going, but nothing to bad. Puts out a good amount of steam for small jobs, had to put the nozzle right up close for the pressure to work on the really caked on areas and went thru it like butter. Hit my finger tips a couple times with the deflected steam, but wasn't hot enough to do any harm. Then again I'm used to working on hot engine/transmission parts with my bare hands. Few seconds doesn't bother ya. Not exactly scalding hot. I used a couple bottles of spring water, as I'm not about to buy distilled. I hear adding a little vinegar helps the process. I'll try that when I tackle the toaster oven tomorrow. I wanted to try this one out for its size, I'm limited to where I can hide the nifty household gadgets. All in all I'd say it's worth every penny. So long as it lasts a while, I'm a happy camper. I've got a whole list of things lined up for this little gem. Tub and tile grout, bathroom sink formica surface, built up black soot on old ceramic propane fire pit logs, built up grime around door knobs, fish tank and equipment, pond, fountain and water fall nick nacks that have been out in the weather for years, the door seal on the old dish washer and if it ain't broke by then.... My 30 year old Zayer's special Grill Master. I like that its very light to hold, but the cord and sprayer hose are plenty long enough to set it down anywhere your cleaning. I've also got some old lawn furniture that has that green algae tint on the legs that this would make short work of. I bet you could steam clean an engine real nice too, without harming any wires or hoses. Has many many applications. Wonder how well it would do on tough carpet stains with the wet/dry vac to suck out the dirt, would make life much easier than having to set up a big carpet steam cleaner just for a small area. I'll be back for an update once I get all these odd jobs taken care of. For now, looks like it's well worth the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "So the adjustment on the steam rate does absolutely nothing. It's full steam ahead. The grip sucks is your actually trying to do detail work. If you want to use brushes just quit while your ahead as they themselves are good brushes but you can't get hold of anything to actually brush something. I don't mind a little pain and grind but the plastic threads feel like they are going to give at any point which would cause much more pain than I'm willing to chance. But it does steam for sure and fairly quickly.Unit is designed to be garbage after the heating unit. Tank size at the rate it steams is to little. Grip is horrible. Anything but the small one inch brush is to much for the handle to hold let alone any scrubbing power.I think it might be cool in illinois winters to go out in sub zero Temps and make it snow.This unit is so badly advertised and such a bad product the seller should be ashamed.But I do note, I've cleaned 2 door cards (apologies to the passenger side of my jeep) and one 3x5 carpet format (with the assistance of a pressure washer). All three turned out fantastic. I mean minus the three 2nd degree burns from the handle and various words I shared when it \"bit\" me due to the lack of any ability to put any force into this.I would not recommend the product nor would I the seller. This is obviously garbage but I had to spend the money to prove it to myself. I'm saving you the trial and tribulation.",

It leaks just above the handle. Therefore there's no steam goind out and you cannot handle it as it is very hot.Pay a higher price, rent one.... But DO NOT purchase this item.",
