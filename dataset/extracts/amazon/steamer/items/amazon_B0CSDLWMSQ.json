                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a handy steamer for my home, and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer. The compact and lightweight design of the steamer makes it very easy to use and store, and it heats up quickly, so I can start steaming my clothes almost immediately. The steamer is very versatile and can be used to remove wrinkles from a variety of fabrics, including cotton, silk, and polyester. I was initially worried about using it on delicate fabrics, but the steamer has proven to be gentle enough to use on even the most delicate of fabrics without causing any damage. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase of the handy steamer. It is a high-quality and versatile product that has made my life a lot easier. I would highly recommend this steamer to anyone looking for a quick and efficient way to remove wrinkles from their clothes.The product was on sale and the price was great. The continuous steam option is a very useful feature. The steamer is powerful. There is a faint humming sound which is expected from most handheld steamers. It also comes with all the accessories needed and also a CUP. That's very thoughtful!It is lightweight and easy to use. If you don't have an iron board or don't have time to set up the iron board every time, then this is the best option for you.",
