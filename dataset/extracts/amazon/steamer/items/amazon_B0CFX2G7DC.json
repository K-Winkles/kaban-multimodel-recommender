Indeed, as described, it can iron from any angle, so ironing horizontally or vertically is both possible. It's a perfect alternative to the traditional iron at my home.I recemmend this.",

                "reviewText": "I have a bigger steamer that I mainly use for cleaning but has a garment attachment. I've never really felt all that confident using it, to be totally honest. So when I saw this steamer/iron combo, I thought it would be perfect to fill that gap.It's been so great to have in the house. It heats up very quickly, and is super easy to use. There is only really one heat setting for the steam and for the iron, but that's just fine for what I need it for- it hasn't caused any issues with anything that I've needed to steam or iron. The iron plate is small, but in my opinion it's really just a bonus add on to what was always meant to be a steamer.I have used this thing several times and been really happy with the results each time- whether I'm steaming silky and satiny fabrics, linen, or something thicker, this garment steamer handles them all just fine. When I need to go in with the ironing plate for a little extra, it handles really well also. I haven't had any issues with burns or anything- it really seems like this steamer/iron was designed to be useful across the board no matter what it's being used on.This is a great tool to have around the house, especially when you've got a lot of people in your home and don't really have time to devote to ironing and steaming every little thing, but need to make sure that those things are wrinkle released before they are worn out. I have a family of 5 and it's been invaluable in our home.",

                "reviewText": "Like others have said, it is a bit bulky in the hand. Though I didn't order it for prolonged use. I ordered it to be able to steam a shirt while it's on a hanger and for that this works very well. I have not tried it as an iron and I have no intention of trying it as an iron on a flat surface. To me it was a way to be able to get wrinkles out without having to fight to get sleeves over the ironing board. Sure it's a bit large to hold in hand, but I'm not using it for a prolonged amount of time so it's not much an issue. I'm sure there are other steamers out there that are better shaped to hold but I'm perfectly content with this for the few minutes at a time it will be used.Definitely use distilled water in it vs tap though so you don't end up with buildup in it over time.",

                "reviewText": "Overall verdict: This is a great portable garment steamer that heats quickly (in less than a minute), lasts a while, and will not leak.I ordered this steamer for traveling. It\u2019s convenient to keep in luggage and takes up very little space, and when the description says it won\u2019t leak, they mean it. I filled up the tank and twisted and shook the steamer every which way to try to see if it would leak, and it just won\u2019t, even when it\u2019s in use. It takes less than a minute to reach temperature, and lasts more than 15 minutes when it\u2019s full. This is definitely a great option for anyone looking for a portable steamer to toss in your luggage and forget until you need it.The only minor issue is that its small size means the power cord out the side produces a lot of torque when you put it down on a surface, so you need to be careful that it doesn\u2019t twist awkwardly and fall. Still, this is a minor issue and is fairly easily avoided.If you travel (or just need a convenient steamer in general), this is a solid choice.",

It is easy to refill with water and convenient to use. Since it is a portable one, the water reservoir is not big. It's enough to steam one article of clothing thoroughly before I have to refill. The one side with this portable one is that it doesn't have a rack to hang my clothes while steaming. Other than that, it's very easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "I like this smaller steamer. It heats up really fast. You can use it upright or you can use it like a regular iron. It was easy to fill up with water. It is a little awkward to hold though. My hand is small and after a few minutes, it became uncomfortable for me to hold. I have a larger steamer that has a different handle than this, which has no handle. I will use my larger one for the bigger jobs like steaming curtains and bed ruffles. But for a quick steam, this will work just fine. It has a long enough cord to reach where I hang my clothes to steam them. It\u2019s not heavy, so that is a big plus for me. This is small enough to pack in your suitcase and not take up a lot of space. I really like this compact steamer. It\u2019s about a fourth of the weight of my big steamer. I give this two thumbs up.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice little steamer. My older steamer would get a lot of steam flowing for a while, then cool down and make you wait for it to start flowing again, but this one heats up quickly and emits steam in a continuous, pulsing fashion. I also like how it allows for horizontal usage as well, because my old one would spill out water if I tilted it too much, which is easy to do when steaming around a large item. As a dry iron, it is limited to low-temperature fabrics, as 257F is really not hot enough to get a cotton shirt smoothly ironed. But this steamer is really more about getting out minor wrinkles on already-ironed shirts and being easy to pack for travel purposes; it is great for this. The long cord is also a nice feature. I have attached some before-and-after pictures of a lightweight cotton shirt, and there is definitely a noticeable improvement after using the steamer. I'm happy with it overall, and I think it is a good deal. Just don't expect it to replace a full-fledged steam iron.",
