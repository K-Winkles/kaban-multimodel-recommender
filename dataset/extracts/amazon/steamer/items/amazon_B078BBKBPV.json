After making sure that it worked, I took it home and did enough research to determine that it is a model 1940w. I considered the options for replacement pads and ended up buying these four \"scrubbier\" pads. They arrived promptly, fit perfectly, stay on snuggly and clean great. I cannot compare them to the originals, but I'm very happy with both the steam mop and the pads.",
