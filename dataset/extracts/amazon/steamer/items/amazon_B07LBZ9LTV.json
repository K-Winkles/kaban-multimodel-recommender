                "reviewText": "This steamer is wonderful, sturdy, easy to clean and operate. I suspect, it goes through the distilled water so fast as a result of its impressive steam capabilities. I find myself always needing more water. I can easily go through 2 gallons if I need to steam items after traveling to return to my closet. If I wasn't such a clothes hog I'd suspect that maybe a gallon would be ample. I do find it pleasurable to get the job done when results prove such a professional finish.I'd caution you to not let young ones near the steam head as it will burn, I've caught myself not paying the attention required and I have had a couple minor wrist burns. Buy it and invest in distilled water!",

                "reviewText": "My PureSteam Pro upright steamer arrived in good condition and has performed well thus far. It heats the water quickly and is easy to use. It's also reasonably easy to move around. The garment hanger works well, although I do find that, when using the clips on the hanger, they're prone to moving around, which is to say it's hard to keep them spread apart to keep the garment taut. (I'll probably devise some fix for that.) It's a nice, professional-styler steamer for the price. I would recommend the Puresteam Pro steamer without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a bunch of steamers and this by far is the best. So easy to turn on/off, large water tank, good amount of steam and the fact that the hanger part attaches to the pole so securely makes it so much easier. So many of the others have just a hook that you have to hang a hanger on and the hanger swings while you are trying to steam. There are only 2 minor things I wish I could change-- but this by all means should not keep you from buying this steamer. I wish is that the clips didn't slide so easily because sometimes they move together when you hang an item and also that it had an auto shut off feature after running for a long while. Its so easy to turn the steamer off with the tap of your foot but I'm just waiting for the day one of my teenagers doesn't do it.",

The foot pedal for control of the on and off switch is convenient, much more efficient than bending over to use one's hands.The steamer heats in a matter of seconds - probably 30 to 45 and makes quick work of wrinkles.We have elected to use our own hangers rather than use the one that came with the product. We found that our clothes hung better with our own hangers than the one provided and allowed us to better remove wrinkles.In all, this was a good purchase and worth the price paid.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I am quite impressed with the steamer's design. It manages to strike a perfect balance between functionality and aesthetic appeal, delivering efficient steaming performance while looking sleek. Unlike previous steamers I've owned, this one stands firm and doesn't topple over easily, which is a huge relief.However, there is one particular issue that I've encountered with this steamer: the hose tends to kink when attempting various steaming maneuvers, causing a hindrance in the steam flow towards the nozzle. As a result, I often find myself needing to hold the hose with one hand, compromising the ease and safety of using the steamer. This requirement of holding the hose diminishes the convenience factor that drew me to this steamer in the first place.In conclusion, while I appreciate the overall design and impressive steaming capabilities of this steamer, the issue with the kinking hose is a notable drawback. Having to constantly hold the hose while operating the steamer undermines its ease of use and safety. Addressing this concern would greatly enhance the overall experience and make it a truly exceptional steamer.",

Quite a few times i left it on and forgot, 15 minutes later it's still putting out steam and happy as a clam. Then one afternoon after 2 yrs of 2x daily use (that'd be $50/year or like 15 cents a day?) it just stopped turning on. Wanh! Got in touch with the company to see if they had any advice, assuming I'd never hear back... and they responded within hours! And ultimately replaced it. So hassle free, so prompt, so unusual. Why would anyone take the time to review a steamer? That's why! And PS for any of you considering off-label use, I found it's also really good for styling curly hair. Hence the 2x daily use.",

My husband didn't like the piece that sticks out on the bottom of the steamer head. He said it would pull on sweaters. I didn't have that issue. And out of nowhere the steamer just stopped working the other day. The light went off and it just died. We only had it for seventeen months and it's done. This was was the third steamer I have purchased(two Conair, one Pure Enrichment). Instead of buying another steamer for another $150, I took the plunge and ordered the Jiffy J-2000 it's double the price but at least it has a three year warranty.",
