This steamer is almost the ideal size that I want for when I'm traveling, but it's just big enough that it can be a challenge to pack among other items, so this tends to stay at home. Nonetheless, this steamer does a great job at getting the wrinkles out of my clothes. Easy and straightforward to use. Just fill up the refillable tank with water, power the steamer up, wait for it to heat the water up and start steaming. I just wish it came with some sort of bag to store it, but I was able to find one to keep the steamer from getting damaged or scratched when not in use.One thing to keep in mind. I recommend using distilled water to help prevent any sort of mineral buildup that may occur when using tap water or another source of water.",

                "reviewText": "I'm terrible at ironing. I actually iron wrinkles that weren't there before into my clothes, so I love steaming them instead! The NOMAD steamer is super simple to use and operate. Once you fill the removable tank with distilled water (important not to use tap water), just press the power button and you're ready to steam in under a minute! And, if you're absentminded like I am, you'll appreciate that it shuts itself off after ten minutes if not switched off manually.It's not as powerful as a standing steamer, obviously, but it's still quite effective with several passes in each area. I was somewhat misled by the \"travel\" size aspect since I thought it would be smaller than the other handheld steamer I have, which is too bulky to pack if I'm only taking a carry-on, which is all the time now. It's \"travel\" size in comparison to a standard full-size steamer, but still not quite small enough for me to take on quick trips, but that's because I tend to pack so light. Overall, if you're sick of ironing, or tired of hauling around a standing steamer, switch to this!",

                "reviewText": "I became an iron-to-steamer convert several years ago and have no plans of going back! When I'm at home, I use a full-size upright steamer from Steam and Go, but I've been on the lookout for a travel steamer for a while now.This compact steamer from Steamfast is quite small & compact, especially compared to the other \"travel\" models I've seen here on Amazon. The steamer & cord fit comfortably into a carry-on bag or full-size suitcase, so it is perfect for travel. While it is quite a bit smaller than some of the other compact steamers out there, I still kind of wish it was even smaller. As it is, I will probably only take the unit with me when traveling domestically, and probably won't take it with me on flights.As far as the functionality, the unit works great and is very simple to operate. As soon as you plug it in, it starts heating for steam. To release the steam, just press the green trigger. The tank holds just enough to get several garments done at once and is pretty easy to refill as well.Overall, pretty happy with this little steamer. While I do wish it was just a tiny bit smaller, I think it's a great option for travel, and the price is competitive at the sub-$40 list price.",

Before I did, I saw this and figured I'd give it a try. Definitely worth it. It takes about the same amount of time as an iron to get clothing completely wrinkle free, but without the risk of you accidentally damaging your favorite top.The manual says to use distilled water. If you can't, just be sure to clean it thoroughly after every use because minerals from tap or bottled water can build up inside of it, causing the life of it to shorten.",
