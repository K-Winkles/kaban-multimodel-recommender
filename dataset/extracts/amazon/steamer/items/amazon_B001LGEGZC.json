                "reviewText": "We had a Haan Steamer for many years. They do not sell them in the US any longer. We bought another Steamer, which we like although not the quality (or price) of a Haan. We do still favor these pads on the new machine!Our current machine came with white velcro pads, just the same size of the unit. White. Use them twice and they are a mess. They aren't thick enough to last much longer, IMO. However, these Haan pads are significant pads and last for months. They wash up well. Best if washed immediately so dirt doesn't linger. Hang to dry. Since they last so long, I feel the price is well worth it.My current steamer can get very hot and this more substantial pad does a better job of absorption of water over the amount of tile we have in our home. A thinner pad and we'd have to put on multiple to get through the house. Who wants to do that when it is steaming hot?These pads go outside the head of our current steamer a bit, but I think that is an advantage. They stay put better as there isn't just 4-5 little pieces of velcro, the whole entire pad can grab all the points of contact.We do buy the original and not off brands. Due to length of use, they are worth the cost. We will keep buying so long as they keep selling.......",

We use them on ceramic tile floors that are in high traffic areas including the kitchen, pantry, small dining area and sun room. Even the originals still attach firmly and clean well after almost ten years of use. They are easily cleaned in a short cycle in the washing machine and then will quickly air-dry. I noted that some reviews indicated that size and thus fit had been a problem but note that there are other suppliers than the OEM, Haan, so suggest when shopping on line be sure the source you select is a Haan supplier.",

                "reviewText": "This far outshines the steamer that gave us problems. This HAAN does not leave puddles of water and because of the texture of the pads, it really does clean. I was concerned as to how it would get to the corners ... but it does because you move two square corners of the pad into the corners. Tho, it is heavy. If it had some kind of hold at the top to nudge/push the steamer along, would be perfect. Our vacuum has such a handle and it really helps. The other design feature that needs some work is the hand-held portion and attachments to really get in and clean the shower. I really had to work hard on this (and our shower was not that bad). When using the hand held portion it is way too heavy and it was difficult to clean the upper and lower portions of the shower ... because of the water flow and the cords. I think it is designed to clean horizontally and not vertically. But all-in-all it works.I still need to use it a few more times on the tile and use the rug cleaning feature before I'd give it the five-star rating. I did order extra pads so that I'd have them. But, I don't think you need to because the pads appear to be quite durable ... I love the texture of the pads for really \"scrubbing\" the kitchen floor tile!",

So no product problem. They arrived securely packaged by my front door and I received a confirmation photo. My feedback is on the improvements to Amazon in the last 6 months. I had purchased a pack of cheaper pads, the quantity alone I figured made them a better value. I admit the Hahn pads are washable so I was also lazy. The \u201cnight\u201d before my dinner party I began cleaning to find that they shredded with every stroke.I quickly placed an order with Amazon which arrived the next day jus in time to finish the floor. The delivery to my home, which is a half hour away from a place to purchase bread and milk is phenomenal! My PRIME membership has saved me both time and money, I\u2019m ashamed to save every week.Thanks once again.",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased this steam mop because I'm pretty much responsible for steam mopping the kitchen at our house. Well, my previous mop (Shark Steam Mop) left me with a sore shoulder. Today I tried the new mop and boy, what a difference! First of all, it was easy to assemble. This was no chore. The mop is light weight! I added the water and put the timer on in the kitchen for three minutes to let it heat up. I then mopped the kitchen. Where I used to be pushing what felt like a leadweight - this was light and super easy. We had food splotches on the floor and they melted right off with no problems. The few that were tricky, I just let the mop sit on the spot for a few seconds and then moved back and forth and did it a few times and the spot vanished fast. With my previous mop, it was tons of effort and pushing. This just slides over the floor and does exactly what they advertise. It quickly picks up the dirt. The floor will look like it's slightly wet but then it dries within a few minutes so you see no liquid at all. I am sold on this product. I would definitely buy this over the Shark one if only for the feature that involves no pumping of steam! The best part is that its easy to slid and I don't feel like I'm pushing something heavy around the floor. Way to go Haan!",

I keep some clean ones in the rotation knowing I will always have a fresh absorbant pad available when steam cleaning the hardwood or stone floor. Steam cleaning is the way to go IMHO. These pads are well made ( stitched) and have survived countless machine washings. They shrink very little and maintain their shape. The velcro strips have not torn off. A very good product I found them to be.",
