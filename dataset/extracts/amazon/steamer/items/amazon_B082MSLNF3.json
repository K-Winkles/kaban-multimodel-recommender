I\u2019m going on a 2 week vacation next week so I tested it out. It works great. It heats up super fast and does a great job. The only downside is that it\u2019s very small so I got only 4 pieces of clothing steamed in one sitting. The water compartment is small so it only steams 3-4 pieces at a time. But that\u2019s not a problem for me since I wanted something small and lightweight for travel. It\u2019s a great purchase and I wish I bought it many years earlier for traveling purposes. Also be very careful with it because it will burn you if you\u2019re not careful and do not leave it out if you have little kids. II find it easier to use if you hand your clothing on a hanger so you won\u2019t burn yourself and that way you can keep the steamer in an upright position.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't owned an iron in years but, some of the clothes I have to wear for work are a bit wrinkled. I bought my son a big steamer and he loved it so I thought about a handheld one for me. This is EXCELLENT. I can plug it in before I shower and steam my shirt to be ready for the day. I've steamed bulky sweaters, shirts, t-shirts, and pants within minutes. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is pretty great. I was able to clean up two very crumpled and dog hair covered wool pea coats, and a formal gown, as well as the dry cleaners would have within about two hours. However, the lint brush attachment that goes on the front of the steamer completely fell apart before I was even finished with one item. It\u2019s unfortunate because it was really helpful in pulling off some hair and little \u201cpilled up\u201d bits of fabric.I like this steamer, it would be a perfect device if the attachments were more sturdy and maybe 1-2oz more in the water compartment so you can really get an entire item steamed/cleaned/dewrinkled with only one filling, rather than having to add more water 3/4 if the way through.I was impressed with how quickly it heats up, how easy it is to use, and how well it worked on my items I did not have time to take to the cleaners.Overall good, but could use some improvement.",
