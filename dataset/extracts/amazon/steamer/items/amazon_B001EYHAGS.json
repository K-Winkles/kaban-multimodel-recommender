                "reviewText": "I can't believe how much stuff this steamer comes with for this price, especially since it actually works really well lol. I didn't realize it came with a hose or squeegee, or garment steamer head! It's awesome. I just bought it impulsively because everyone recommends it and I needed a better one. All the stuff fits back in the box for storage pretty well too which is important to me because I lose things.This machine is worth the price just for how much easier it makes cleaning the fridge. It's so much less painful for me that I can do it way more often. I don't have to take everything out or wash the big glass shelves in the bathtub. I'm not getting soapy water in/on my food or forgetting stuff on the counter to go bad.This machine is so much better than my last one, too. It's so much less awkward and easier to use. I've used it on tons of surfaces now with dried on or baked on stuff that I couldn't easily get off with different scrubbers and cleaning chemicals. Steam is so much faster and easier. I don't have to rinse off bubbles/chemicals for 2 hours or keep refilling a hot water bucket. It comes with a ton of little attachments that are actually useful.The things I don't like about this device are that if you use the hose, the steam button is only on the machine and it can't be locked down. There's no button on the hose. You have to hold the button down on the machine with one hand and use the hose in the other hand. It means if you want to use a rag or brush or anything between bouts of steam, you have to keep switching hands. You also can't, like, brace a grill or rack with one hand while you steam with the other, because both hands have to hold the steamer. If you only have use of one hand you probably just can't use the hose by yourself without like, taping the button down. I know it would have cost more to also activate the steam from the hose, so I see why that might not be an option. But you should at least be able to lock the existing button down or something like that. Lots of steam cleaners have always-on steam so it wouldn't be less safe than those.The machine is shaped like a kettle bell or something lol. The bottom surface is round and tiny. Since the machine has a hose that puts weight on one side, and it's all round, it should have a big flat bottom so it won't roll over all the time. It's pretty annoying trying to keep it standing up when you set it down for a second. It just rolls over. Even without the hose, the shape is so strange and unstable that it takes too much thought to set it down properly.There's no low water indicator or water level window etc. I thought the water tank was empty because the steam lost power, but there was a lot left. (I think I just needed to let it reheat before continuing to use it, but I didn't realize.) You aren't supposed to overfill it, but if it's not empty you can't tell how much is left in there so you can't know how much to put in. Since I'd already spent the time to depressurize the machine, I emptied the tank so I could be sure to refill it with the correct amount of water. Of course I burned myself. I wish it had a better way to tell how much water is left.The orange \"heating\" indicator light is on the bottom where you can't see it when you're holding it in your left hand. It should be higher up and visible from both sides.I think that's it! I really like it but it would be a thousand times better if the button locked.",
