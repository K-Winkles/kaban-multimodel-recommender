It is much easier to use - and with better results - than my traditional iron/ironing board set-up. This garment steamer allowed me to eliminate wrinkles that had persisted in apparel made of delicate fabric that I had never been able to wear because I was hesitant to use a higher heat setting on my standard iron. This steamer quickly removed those wrinkles. Thanks for a great product!",

As seen in the pictures there\u2019s little to no wrinkles left on the shirt I used it on. Could be great for traveling! Beware it does indeed get very hot so be careful not to touch the top or let it cool properly before putting away.",

                "reviewText": "Salav HS-04/T is a great steamer. Seems well built and removed the wrinkles on the suite and shirt we tried it on so far. It has very solid feel and good ergonomics. It starts very fast (under a minute). The cord is just over 8 feet long. The handle stayed cool during use. The only minor drawback is the small size of the water reservoir, but it is very easy to refill and I imagine this size makes the appliance easier to handle. Also it came triple-boxed which is good and bad, but I think the outer box was Amazon's fault as they want to put their logo on top.",

The container that holds the water is tucked under the handle, and it holds a very minimal amount of water. The device works great, but you'll find yourself running to the bathroom or kitchen every 5 minutes to refill it. (2.) the cord is too short! I've steamed everything from comforters, to blouses, to drapes, and the short-cord is very limiting.At any rate, I would still recommend this steamer!",

                "reviewText": "The SALAV HS-04/T 1000W Quick Steam Hand Held Garment Steamer turned out to be a steamy disappointment. With its promise of quick steam and no-drip system, I expected a hassle-free experience, but that was far from the reality.Firstly, the \"Quick Steam\" claim was misleading. This steamer took forever to heat up, leaving me impatient and frustrated. I could have ironed an entire wardrobe by the time this steamer finally started producing steam.The \"No-Drip System\" feature seemed like a distant dream. Instead of a smooth and dry steaming process, I was left dealing with annoying water droplets constantly dripping on my clothes. It's like the steamer had its own waterworks show going on, and I was the unwilling audience.The dual steam settings were supposed to provide versatility, but they lacked any noticeable difference. I couldn't discern between the low and high settings, making me question if they were even working properly.Furthermore, the 1000W power promised efficient steaming, but it fell short of removing wrinkles effectively. I felt like I was battling my clothes, trying to tame the wrinkles with little success.The build quality was another letdown. The steamer felt flimsy and poorly constructed, like it could fall apart at any moment. It's not something I would trust for long-term use.To add to the frustration, the steamer started leaking water from the bottom, leaving a wet mess behind. It's like it couldn't contain its own water supply, turning my steaming session into a watery disaster.In conclusion, the SALAV HS-04/T 1000W Quick Steam Hand Held Garment Steamer failed to live up to its promises. It's slow to heat up, prone to water dripping, lacking in steam power, and poorly constructed. I wouldn't recommend this steamer to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient garment steamer. Save yourself the frustration and invest in a better-quality steamer for your clothing care needs.",

Took the wrinkles out of my jeans as well as light cotton blouse and pants. If doing multiple items will have to refill with distilled water often. Is very easy to use and refill. I did not care for the brush. I tried it on my raincoat but I think it would have done a better job without the brush. Wonderful for touching up wrinkles in already ironed clothes. I usually have to iron things three times to get all the wrinkles out. I won't have to worry about that again.",
