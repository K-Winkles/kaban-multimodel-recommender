You just use the little cup it comes with and put water in it and then pour the water in the steamer and turn it on. The handle closes to make it easier to travel with and store. The steam isn\u2019t the most powerful but it\u2019ll get the job done. A regular cotton shirt took me about 10 minutes. It doesn\u2019t do the best job on jeans or thick linen but it did get about 60% of the wrinkles out so if you\u2019re in a pinch you could use it to look a little better. This is one of the better travel steamers I have tested. I do recommend this steamer.",

Cons, it takes longer to use than the conventional iron and board method, had to keep refilling the water tank, almost burnt my hand and it didn't give that crisp pressed look to my clothes. I can see the benefit of having it if you travel a lot but for daily use, I will stick to the iron and board method.",

                "reviewText": "Recently used this while on a trip to Korea, and proved to be very useful. Made quick work of steaming my very wrinkled clothing. Super quick heat up and produced plenty of steam. Fairly intuitive to use. Really hits the mark for portability, and quite honestly is far more effective than I anticipated. It would take me maybe a minute, two at most, to steam a single shirt.Feels like it will last awhile. Just make sure to try and use the softest water you can - ideally distilled - but reverse osmosis is the next best option, which is what I use in any appliance with a water reservoir. This is probably the most important aspect to consider if you want to prolong the life of appliances like this.",

                "reviewText": "The seekclass steamer looks really sleek and elegant, the look is what drew my attention to the product initially, functionality is good too. Light weight and compact, it folds nicely so you can store it away or carry it during travel which is great, when folding it the plastic creaks a little bit though which is a bit concerning and seems like the hinges aren\u2019t the greatest. But the folding works well nevertheless. Power cord is a bit shorter than I would like at about 8 feet, depending on where your outlet is this could be a problem without an extension cord. The tank is large enough and easy to fill with the included funnel, you could run this thing for probably 15 minutes before a refill. Design is sleek and has a nice finish and branding on the product is good not too obtrusive.The steamer itself works really well, I tried with some delicates with light wrinkles which is usually what a steamer is better for and it worked very well, it takes longer to use than a regular iron but sometimes easier and less frustrating. The steam jet is good and powerful the steam comes out fairly consistently. A con of this product I see is it claims to be leak proof which is usually the main problem with steamers, they leak water onto clothes, this one doesn\u2019t leak much when using it vertically. But when using horizontally it definitely leaks so probably don\u2019t use it that way, even in the marketing video on the listing it clearly leaks in the video when using it horizontally so that is a bit misleading.But nevertheless for the price this steamer is good. It isn\u2019t the perfect steamer since it does dribble and leak but it is light weight, affordable, portable, and gets wrinkles out.",
