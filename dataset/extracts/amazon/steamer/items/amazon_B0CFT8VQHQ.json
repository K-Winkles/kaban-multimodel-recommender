                "reviewText": "If I could give this YIKA Portable Steamer 3.5 / 5 stars, I would. I decided to take it on a trip and see how it works, and it's OK but not great.Here's what worked well:* The unit heats up very quickly, less than a minute and you're ready to go* The iron function is good for such a small iron* The steam function is good in conjunction with the iron* The unit can steam continuously without needing to \"recharge\"I have one big wish: This does not work well as a standalone steamer. Sure, lots of steam comes out of the unit. But it seems to go directly up / vertical, and not much steam moves perpendicular, onto the hanging clothing. The truth is that when I am traveling, I don't want to drag that bulky, noisy ironing board out of the tiny closet. It would be great if the steamer-only function did a better job.Such a bummer -- so much potential!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m really happy with this garment steamer. I love that it heats up really fast, in about 30-45 seconds. It has a light so you know when it\u2019s ready. I was able to steam about 3-4 shirts before needing to refill the water tank. In my hands it feels like it\u2019s made out of a sturdy material, it\u2019s compact enough to be stored for traveling, and the cord is a good length. During steaming, I noticed that I would get more water splatter from the machine when it was close to running out of water. Once you get an idea of how long each fill will last you can avoid the splatter or just wait for the spot to dry.I wish that the included measuring cup could be stored on or in the item somehow. It can easily be replaced if lost, but it would be nice to not have to carry it around especially if you are using it while traveling. This steamer is also an iron, but the temperature cannot be adjusted. The instructions say to use a damp cloth over garment to iron, which works but I would feel more comfortable using the iron side if I could control the amount of heat for different fabrics. I feel like the steamer does such a good job of getting rid of the wrinkles, the lack of temp control on the iron does not bother me at all, but it may bother you if you were hoping to use the iron function to get creases/pleats on delicate fabrics.I would highly recommend this if you want a portable, stylish steamer that heats up fast.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a cool little steamer for garments. It heats up crazy fast. It's easily ready to dry iron in 10-15 seconds, There's no temperature control, so be careful what you try to dry iron!The steam comes out pretty quickly too, I like that you don't have to hold the button down. You press to enable the steam, then press it again later to turn the steam off.The unit stores hot right on the base. I was a little worried it would melt it or something, but for testing, I left it sitting in there hot and plugged in for 10 minutes and it was fine.Like any iron, use water with no minerals in it (distilled water, not tap or drinking water).I think it's nearly a perfect design, and well worth the full 5 stars. There's only a few things I'd change:- Add a strap to the cord to make it easier to wrap it up for travel- Make the water level easier to see, especially when the unit is not plugged in",

                "reviewText": "As mentioned in the instruction manual, this portable travel size clothing steamer requires the use of distilled or purified water for the best results. I used regular tap water in the steamer and I got a tiny white streak on a black puffy jacket that I was trying to steam some wrinkles out of. After about an hour of use, I can see some calcium buildup around one of the steam holes on the iron's surface.This steam iron is small in size and has a long cord, which that makes it great for travel use. Because it is small it does not hold a lot of water for steaming. That means that it's better suited for steaming smaller areas or smaller garments.The water level gauge on the front is a bit difficult to read because it is made of dark plastic. It has two blue led lights, a larger one at the top of the gauge and a smaller one near the bottom of the gauge. I had to look closely to try determine how to read the gauge correctly. It seems that when the steamer is empty the tiny blue led is all the way down at the bottom of the gauge. As water is added to the iron the tiny blue led light rises up to meet the larger blue led light at the top of the gauge.I am not sure why the water level gauge has to be so complicated. Due to that issue I deduct one star and rate this portable travel clothing steamer at four stars.",

Anything from curains to your favorite blouse the power of this steamer blasts out wrinkles in seconds in most cases. What I enjoy mostly is I don't need an ironing board I can leave the items I need to steam on the hanger and just go to work on them. I would say I can do a shirt in about 2 minutes from start to finish. In the box you get a cup that can be used to fill up the water compartment after that hit the gold button and watch the magic happen. Please use extreme caution with your hands when using it because the metal on the bottom and the steam is extremely hot and could passably burn you so use caution as you would with anything that gets hot. I highly recommend this product",
