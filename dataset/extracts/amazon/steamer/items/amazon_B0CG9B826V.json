Works great on bathtub,sink, corner's of shower door.in kitchen it works great around sink area, countertop, doorknob,seats and back of chairs . It heats up super fast I mean it's seams like minutes and it ready to go when the water runs out it has a safety features that won't let you open top cap until it cools down it doesn't take long and then when you see the little red button on the very top go down it cool enough to open. It helps to push trigger button to let out any leftover built up stream. I also think it is very well made it has a good solid one piece appearance and a electrical cord that is long enough to reach good size areas without having to unplug and replug constantly.",
