                "reviewText": "I bought this to use to clean out my pets' food and water bowls. I didn't like the idea of using soap (would that taste remain?) and I wanted something that would disinfect the bowls. My animals all use stainless steel bowls. Well, at first it really scared the cats. It sounded like a really angry hiss. They are used to it now and I not only use it to clean their bowls, but also to clean my kitchen sink and countertops. Yes, it does produce water (it is called STEAM!) but it does a great job in cleaning and is very portable. I used it also to clean the tiles in my bathroom and ended up cleaning the shower doors. There was always a problem with hard water stains and I was very reluctant to use chemicals that advice you to use gloves.The steamer did the trick. I applied steam to the doors, used a squeegee and lo and behold, my doors are free of those annoying stains. The steam lasts about 10 minutes, but I didn't buy this little guy to clean everything. I might get a bigger steamer for that, but I would definitely recommend this steamer for anyone who has lots of small jobs. It is also a great way to clean and sanitize pet food bowls.",

It's easy to refill and only takes about 1-2 minutes to heat up.For $37 I think it works great so far. Refilled and steamed about 10 times so far with 0 problems.",

Ya en uso se aprecia que genera vapor en forma r\u00e1pida pero intermitente, es decir, despu\u00e9s de unos cuantos disparos de vapor debes esperar a que obtenga una nueva cantidad suficiente para continuar la labor, por lo que puede resultar un poco tedioso. El vapor es buena ayuda en las labores de limpieza, pero de ninguna manera sustituye el uso de agentes limpiadores y cepillos.",
