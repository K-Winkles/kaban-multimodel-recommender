They are EXACTLY the same as the one that came with the mop, aside from about being about 1/2\" longer & 1/4\" wider. The minimal size difference does NOT impact performance at all. The texture of the mop pad surface, as well as the back of the pads all feel identical to the Shark brand one, minus the Shark tag on the one that came with the steam mop.They wash & dry well. I machine wash & usually line dry them, but I have also tumbled them dry too.I WOULD purchase these again!",
