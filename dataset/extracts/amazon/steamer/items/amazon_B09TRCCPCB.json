                "reviewText": "I love this steamer! I wanted something that was a little more travel friendly since most places I stay don\u2019t have a steamer readily available, and prefer to give something a quick steam vs. an iron (the last iron I had didn\u2019t beat properly and even on the lowest setting burnt a hole through one of my favorite shirts so I swore off irons). It\u2019s big enough to be useful but small enough to pack without it being difficult to manage inside luggage. It fit perfectly in the zippered bottom of my duffle bag (where shoes can be stored) but it\u2019s also unassuming in my large suitcase or even a carry on. It has 3 settings but I\u2019m not sure of the difference between the two on settings. It props up nicely on the counter top. The water chamber is easy to snap on and off, and gives you a little \u201cclick\u201d to reassure you it\u2019s been replaced properly before using again once refilled. It also looks high quality but is very affordable. Great value for the price and what you get!",
