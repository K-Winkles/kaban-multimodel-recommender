                "reviewText": "I was excited to get this steamer as I had watched other video reviews. When the steam cleaner arrived, I excitedly started to clean everything I could think of that needed steam cleaned. It is easy to operate and does really well steam cleaning. I was able to clean built up grime around sink faucets (couldn't get them clean before) and several other things (oven, toilets, etc), however after prolonged use, the steamer lost efficiency. It quit working as well as when I first started to clean things. About a month later, I used it again and it worked really well. I didn't clean near as many things as the first time I used it. I think I must've \"overused\" it the first time. Overall, I feel that it was worth the price I paid (used coupons) for it as it does well when not overdoing it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty nice steamer but I would say the down side is that there is no bag or anything to store the attachments and such. You can store all the necessary attachments inside the box I suppose but it is a bit annoying when you are trying to store this steam pressure cleaner. This steamer is relatively light when it is empty but can get pretty heavy when you add water to it. Is it extremely heavy? No I would say you still should be able to hold it with one hand with water in it. I When this device is filled up, I am able to steam clean pretty much anything but the carpet really. I have tried it between my tiles, car, and even my stove top. It provides a good small stream of steam to get all the tough grime out. It does not utilize too much water and the pressure is using hot steam so be aware of that. It does require external power to power this device. The attachments are nice so you can easily steam clean between tiles which is one of the hardest parts to get to. I also was able to clean between the crevasse of my bathtub and get the grim right out. There are several attachment that are easy to take on and off. There are thin head attachments for those hard to reach corners, there are thinner steamers for those window plates, and the traditional ones for hard wood floors and carpets. There is a gun trigger to release and deploy the steam so you do not have to always constantly have steam when you are trying to clean. You can use as much water as you want however much you want but again be careful because this is steam so it is hot. Another thing to note is that there is no way to clean up the water or suck it up so you need to clean it with a cloth after. Afterwards I would just throw the cloth in the wash after I am done. I have not seen any issues of the steamers dying out on me. Overall I think this steam is pretty nice. It is relatively easy to store and you can put this into any closet space. You have plenty of attachment for all your deep cleanings. You can use this on your bathroom, kitchen or even your car if you wanted to. The steam gun is easy to control. The one minor thing I would say is careful when carrying this full of water and to empty it when you are not using it.",

                "reviewText": "This was delivered earlier today and I haven\u2019t put it down since. My first impression was that it is very well made. I was a little disappointed in the size of the scrub head attachment. It comes with 3 so I was hoping they\u2019d vary in sizes but they don\u2019t. It is pretty lightweight so it\u2019s not hard to carry it around and clean with it. The water lasts a lot longer than I expected which is good because once the water runs out you have to wait about 5-10 minutes for it to cool down before the machine allows you to open the lid to refill. I haven\u2019t experienced any leaks from the machine itself but it is brand new. I do wish it had a longer power cord so I could use it without an extension cord. I was very surprised at how loud the steam was. It makes sense to me now because this little thing is super powerful. I have a heart condition so it\u2019s really hard on my body to scrub things down. This takes the elbow work out of it. I can use one of the attachments on the area and wipe with a towel to remove access water and it\u2019s clean! It really is that easy. It also has a way of making cleaning so fun . It\u2019s so satisfying watching the dirt and grime melt away. I literally had to force myself to put it up for the night and relax. This thing has me cleaning things that I\u2019ve been dreading cleaning willingly and easily. Baseboards and doors are no match for me anymore. I\u2019m about to have the cleanest house on the block.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this originally for myself because of trying to find easier, faster but something that cleans and is less expensive and time consuming.The good part is that it steams windows, bathrooms, kitchen cabinets, draws, handles, knobs, countertops, inside ovens which are hard to clean .. but small tank for water so it doesn\u2019t last long.Now, if you\u2019re doing something where you don\u2019t need to reach into higher or further distances, then it\u2019s so simple to add water, plug in, give a few minutes to warm up and steam! Perfect size for handheld tool, heats up extremely fast, it\u2019s very Safe and provides a selection of tools you can choose to use for certain areas your cleaningFor me work wise, I needed something bigger than that. I ordered one of the same type but for what I do cleaning apartments, i needed a bigger tank to hold water in with a long hose to attach floor steamer which is UNREAL!Comes with many different attachments for steam cleaning. The only thing is I love them both for these reasonsSMALLER HANDLE HELD- I dont have to lugged the big one around so it is a lot more beneficial for this one- it is handle held so you can get closer to the area as different attachments come with this (more than what the bigger one had)- fast warm up time and less space for carrying and still can clean windows amazingly and fast",
