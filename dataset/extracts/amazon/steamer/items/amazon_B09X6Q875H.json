It is perfect for getting wrinkles out of outfits that have been packed a little too long in your carryon bag. It\u2019s super light weight and the directions claim it starts steaming in 2 minutes but it\u2019s definitely ready to go in half that time. Just mind the max fill line because it will spit out HOT water if you go past it but that\u2019s just user error. It also advertises that you can use it on curtains and while this certainly would work on them quite well, you\u2019d probably have to refill it every other panel so if you\u2019re looking for something that can handle those jobs, you may want to get one that has a larger water tank capacity. I still give this thing a 10 out of 10!",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write many reviews on Amazon, but I\u2019m so irritated by this purchase, I felt compelled to warn others.I had a similar-sized steamer that broke (I dropped it, not the product\u2019s fault!) and was about to re-purchase it, when I spotted this steamer for slightly cheaper. I bought it and man, was that a mistake. I didn\u2019t need to use it for a while, so the return window had passed by the time I realized it was awful, so now I\u2019m stuck with it.Pros:None. I guess the cute color? Maybe?Cons:-INCREDIBLY cheaply made. I took photos but they don\u2019t really show how cheap this plastic is. Just getting the top off and on to put the water in is nearly impossible, because the plastic tabs that are supposed to lock into place were so cheaply manufactured, they don\u2019t fit well.-Takes forever to heat up.-Far more importantly than either of the above- it spits hot water out all over you and whatever you are trying to steam. I have attempted to use it on 5 occasions. Every time, the garment is soaking wet and my arms are splattered with water.I wasn\u2019t expecting perfection for 27 bucks, but this misses the mark on every level. Please don\u2019t spend your money on this. It\u2019s my own fault I didn\u2019t test it within the return window, but it\u2019s annoying to be stuck with it. Due to the potential burn hazards, I don\u2019t even feel like I can donate it. I\u2019ll have to throw it away, and I hate waste.",
