                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Convenient, good for travel or people who don't iron much",
                "reviewText": "If you're someone who doesn't really need to use an iron or steamer often, then this is for you. The size of this (see photo) is clearly meant for travel and it comes with a little carrying pouch, which is really convenient. Because of the size, the steamer doesn't hold too much water, but definitely enough to iron one or two shirts, depending on how wrinkled and the size of the shirt. It's really easy to use, and the water starts boiling really quickly. My SO irons his shirts before work and it's really efficient. Cleanup is easy as well. I don't know what they recommend, but I usually pour out the water after each use and store it with the lid off to dry it thoroughly.Edit: I came back after some heavy usage to give some more comments. I love this steamer for dress shirts and delicate items, but if you need to steam thick fabrics or or something where you need crisp folds, an iron would be a better choice.Pros:- Lightweight, travel friendly- Heats up really quickly- Enough to steam one or two dress shirt with one fill- Doesn't leak water or drip (don't tilt steamer past 45 degrees)- Gentle enough to handle delicates, silk, etc.Cons:- Can't handle heavy or thick shirts well, or is time consuming- You can't get the crisp folds an iron can do- Because of the travel size, tank is not large enough for long usage",

                "reviewText": "This little number is the perfect size. You are able to travel with it, and store it easily. I've found that it holds the perfect amount of water to steam several garments at once. It heats up within a minute or two, and is quick to stop. I like that I can hear a difference when the steam begins to come out. You don't have to wait- just turn it on, and you'll know when to come back. In my case I turn it on, go grab the clothes I want to steam, and listen for the steam to begin.Tips: If you have never used a steamer before and are wondering if the switch from iron to steamer is worth it... It is. I've found that it works just as well, is much quicker, and doesn't wrinkle when moving it around to steam the other side. Hang the clothing on a hanger, and as you put the steam on the item, tug down a little at the bottom to smooth the item down and the steam will allow it to stay straightened out. I then use my hand to smooth it out as well. Several people believe a steamer does not work as well, but done correctly it is a miracle. I also recommend emptying out the water each time when you are finished to avoid rust (though I never do).On the down-side... This product did not last forever. I used it a few times a week for about two/three years before it began leaking. Which is probably longer than most steamers on the market, but still a burden to keep replacing. I will definitely but it again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It\u2019s no secret in our household that I detest the \u2018ironing clothes\u2019 task, and I have been very successful to avoid this chore for over 15 years. Although we own an excellent old iron, along with 2 ironing boards, these items have remained in our back closet safely gathering dust and out of my sight.I am truly thankful for our laundry dryers \u2018no wrinkle\u2019 cycle, and this helps for different material blends, but for an \u2018an all-cotton\u2019 piece of clothing my clothes do not come out perfectly pressed.I have also resorted to hang a mildly creased item in the bathroom while I take a hot steamy shower, and it works for some fabrics, however, most cotton items remain wrinkled.Several years ago, I purchased my first steamer, as an alternative for ironing. This was a \u2018Corey Travelaid Hand Steamer\u2019 and it was a disaster. The Corey Travelaid steamer has a small a very small water reservoir, as it will only accept 2 oz. of water. The on/off toggle switch is 12\u201d down the cord, which is an inconvenient placement. When the steamer top is on, I can\u2019t view the amount of water and there is no automatic shut off. Furthermore, there is no light display to indicate that the steamer is on, and I have to keep checking whether this is working, because it takes over 3 minutes to heat up only 2 oz. of water. However, the worst trait is the exterior of the steamer gets scalding hot, when I clutched the steamer to empty out the excess water, it burnt and blistered the palm of my hand. In conclusion, I considered the Corey Travelaid steamer a dangerous product and I never used it again.The second steamer I purchased was a \u2018Remington Steamer\u2019, and this too was another failure for the following reasons. The \u2018Remington\u2019 has a slightly larger water tank, and this one takes 3 oz. of water. However, there is NO power switch, when the electrical cord plugs into the outlet it immediately starts to heat up, which takes about 4 minutes. Similar to the Travelaid, the Remington does NOT have any type of \u2018on\u2019 indicator display, there is NO automatic power off either, and there is not a way to see the amount of water within the steamer\u2019s tank. In addition to these similar flaws, the last dangerous feature applies to this one too. The exterior gets scorching hot which burns and blisters the hand when touched immediately after, and the Remington steamer needs a long time to cool down before it\u2019s safe to handle. Therefore, the Remington Steamer is a hazardous product as there is NO power switch, and there is no automatic turn off safety feature, and the exterior becomes blistering hot.The URPOWER is my third garment steamer purchase, and this time I got it right, because this one has the extra features and none of the previous steamer flaws. This steamer has the 5 oz. water tank, which is much larger than my previous two steamers and the heat-up time on my steamer is between 1 -2 minutes. The on/off sliding switch is on the handle and convenient for my thumb and right below the sliding switch is an LED light that glows red when the steamer is on. There are two acrylic see-through windows on each side, which allows the view of the water from inside the steamer. Furthermore, this steamer has the safety feature, which automatically powers off when the water is low. However, for me, the most important characteristic is although the exterior does get warm, it never gets too hot to handle therefore there is NO risk of burning my hand as long it as I stay away from the front part of the nozzle where the steam comes out. This allows me to empty out any excess water, and let the steamer air dry for a couple of minutes before putting it away.This was my own full-price purchase, there was no discount, no promotion and I did NOT receive this free. This is an excellent garment steamer, it has all the conveniences and safety features and this clothes steamer is highly recommended by me.",
