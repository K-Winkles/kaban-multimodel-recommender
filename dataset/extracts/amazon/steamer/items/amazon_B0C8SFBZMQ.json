The dress fabric was a little think so we were a little concerned if it would do the job! It worked great steaming the dresses, heated up quickly and there was no \"leaking\" of water. It took out all the wrinkles that the dresses had. It was comfortable to handle and does not feel like some of the cheaper steamers I have used in the past. I used it to steam other outfits over the weekend and am using it a home now, as well! I would definitely recommend this clothes steamer!",
