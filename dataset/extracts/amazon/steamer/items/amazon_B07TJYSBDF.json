                "reviewText": "Don't let the negative reviews discourage you from purchasing this amazing little steamer. It's exactly what I was hoping for. The water begins to boil within a few minutes creating enough steam to get rid of wrinkles on two items then just refill if you need to do more. It was effective on silk, polyester and cotton, alike. As with any item that holds water, completely empty and dry out the vessel or it will accumulate water deposits that could damage the device, especially if using tap water. If you attempt to use this horizontally, like an iron, it will, of course, leak and spit water. You must use this steamer vertically. Just hang your item and steam away. I find it the perfect size for traveling, as it fits in my cosmetic bag rather nicely. Do not use the brush attachment on delicate fabrics. Just use the flat metal piece and you will not snag your fabric. I feel these tips are no-brainers, but negative reviews indicated malfunction of the device when I actually suspect malfunction of the human. Love my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This is a MINI steamer. It only holds a very small amount of water, so it runs for just a few minutes before it needs to be refilled. Then you have to wait for it to cool before you can remove the steamer head to add more water. So this is not good for a large item unless you have plenty of time. However, it does a good job and I would recommend it. Keeping mine for travel!",

All it did was leak water all over everything, water spots galore. Smaller water tank so constantly refill it. And you have to make sure you let it cool all the way down because you have to take the top off to fill up. You will get burned if you don't let it cool down. The only decent thing about it was the power button and it heated up quickly. Other then that waste of time buying it. I don't know if I got a defective one or what since I read good reviews on it. But it is cheaply made...",

Does spit water at first, make sure to not overfill at all and 2. The well isn't very big at all, I only got 1 shirt done with a full well. That's fine if that's all you do but if you plan on using it for longer or bigger items till be refilling A Lot",
