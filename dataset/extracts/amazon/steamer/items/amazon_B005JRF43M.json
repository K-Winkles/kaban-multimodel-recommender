                "reviewText": "I just got started with wood bending when I got this unit. It's easy to operate, heats up quickly, and makes plenty of steam for the average one-off project. I have used it steaming wood in plastic trash bags (you can put the wood in the mold while it is still steaming), and using a collapsible gutter downspout (variable length, good diameter, and a square end for the stream line). It's pretty easy to attach the steam line to whatever you need, just drill a hole and screw the line on. The only thing that I would caution people is to say RESPECT that max fill line on the side of the unit. If you overfill the tank with water, it will trip the overtemp safety switch and shut down the unit until the water cools off. Since you have a lot of water in the tank in this case, that will be a long time. You'll end up having to dump out all that very hot water (not a pleasant chore), and starting from scratch. Not to mention what a way-too-short steam run might do to the wood you're trying to bend. This is a good way to bend wood if you follow the directions.",

                "reviewText": "When I received this steam generator, I was surprised how small it was; I had an image in my mind of it being bigger. None the less, I decided to give it a try. I've been pretty pleased with it. It claims it holds enough water for 2 hours' steaming, but if you fill it with cold water you end up getting just over an hour's worth of steaming before the low water shutoff is activated. But when I want more than an hour of steaming, I just put a pot of water on the kitchen stove, and when this steamer looks like it's getting low, I refill it with already boiling-hot water and can carry on steaming seamlessly. I've had good luck steam bending the inner gunwales for a 95-year-old wood-canvas canoe from Old Town.",

I added a 6\" pipe nipple onto the provided brass fitting and was able to melt through the ice easily. Also used it to defrost my chest freezer. Once heated up, it produces steam for about 2 hours. No power switch, just plug in and wait about 20 minutes for it to start producing steam. Nice to have 12' hose to give lots of reach.",
