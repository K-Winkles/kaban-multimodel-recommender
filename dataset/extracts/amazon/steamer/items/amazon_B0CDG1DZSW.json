            "With 1000W high power, this steamer for clothes effortlessly removes wrinkles and creases in clothes. It warms up in just 30 seconds, and you'll have wrinkle-free clothes in 3-5 minutes, perfect for getting ready in no time. Equipped with an insulated base, so you can easily place the iron after heating to avoid burns.",
            "Our travel steamer for clothes features a triangular tip design that allows for full ironing, making it easy to tackle narrow areas like shirt buttons, plackets, and dress collars. It also features a 90-degree swivel handle for horizontal and vertical ironing, making it more convenient to iron clothes.",
            "The clothes steamer has a slide switch that allows you to easily switch between dry and wet ironing modes. When you plug in the steamer without pressing the button, then you will get an iron. After pressing the button, you can use it as a steamer. It is recommended to use steamer mode which has a better effect than iron.",
            "This portable steamer can be a normal iron or a steamer iron to meet different ironing needs. Suitable for ironing a variety of fabrics, including organic fabrics, nylon blends, wool, cotton, linen, and more.",
            "Our mini travel iron is small and portable, making it easy to pack in your luggage. Perfect for business trips,vacations, or anywhere else you need to smooth and dewrinkle delicate clothing quickly,safely and gently!",
            "Preheat Must Be Completely: Because the water needs to reach a certain temperature to become steam, if you press the steam button in advance, the water has not reached the steam temperature, the high temperature pressure in the tank will squeeze out the water without atomization, which is the cause of most leaks. So we recommend waiting at least 30 seconds to preheat before pressing the steam button."

Also, it does not hold much water, so if you garment is large, you will need multiple fills to complete the steaming. You can use this with or without water, depending on preferences and how wrinkly the garment is.",

The max line on the cup is 100ml, but it only takes about 70-80ml. It heated up extremely fast. When I plugged it in, it\u2019s already emitting quite a bit of heat. So, take care. It outputs a good amount of steam. It can steam the wrinkles out of a shirt or blouse within minutes. It\u2019s relatively compact. It is about 8\u201dx 3\u201d. The handle rotates 90\u00b0 but only in one direction. It also comes with a plate for the iron to rest upon while using or for storage. When resting on the plate, while hot, it did not transfer any heat to the surface below it.Be aware that it will not press or put creases in clothes like an iron would.I really like this steamer. Works really well.",

                "reviewText": "It may be a safety thing, but the cord is impractically short. This is not an iron, where I move the piece of clothing around on a flat surface. No, it is a steamer that I should be able to use with my dress or top on a hanger. And it was not easy for me to find a place to work--with a place to hang being close to an electrical outlet. If your electrical outlets are all near the floor, you are out of luck unless you use an extension cord.And steam is somewhat erratic. Maybe it reaches a certain temp and then turns off? But the steam is not consistent. And if you fill it too full, it will leak and drip hot water.Also be aware that it is recommended that you use distilled water. So good luck with that while in a hotel room. It is nice that the handle turns 45 degrees for a smaller footprint. I can't say I love it, but I don't hate it either. I've been working with its issues and it is getting the wrinkles out!",

                "reviewText": "This arrived at the perfect time, after I accidentally broke my regular iron (don't yank things out of the wall by the cord, kids,) and before I've gotten around to replacing it. So I've been using this at home to substitute for a regular iron. It doesn't work as well for actual ironing as a full sized dedicated iron, but of course it's not really meant to. It did get out most of the wrinkles from an extremely wrinkly cotton dress, though, which I found impressive. It works best on a flat surface if you steam a small area then immediately iron it. As far as just a regular steamer, it gives out a good steady amount of steam. The time it takes to steam something depends on the thickness of the fabric - a silk blouse took about a minute, but thicker fabrics will take longer. It does require frequent refilling of water, but that is to be expected since it's meant to be a portable appliance. This will be nice to have while travelling.",

                "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars Steam is a little strange",
                "reviewText": "This small iron is okay, but it has a couple of drawbacks that surprised me. It comes with a cup for adding water to make steam. It's a nice size for travel & is also handy to use for quick touch-ups if you don't want to pull out the big iron & ironing board. I 've used it with a towel & mini ironing board on my kitchen counter & it's convenient.It would have been nice if a small bag was included for transporting it. I'll use a small bag that I have around the house to hold the iron, fill cup, press cloth & for transporting it.It does a nice job but I couldn't use it like a regular iron. I had to hold the fabric of my blouse on one end and then pull the iron backward across the fabric. I didn't have much luck with pushing the iron forward because the front end isn't tapered & it tended to bunch the fabric up. The iron is oval shaped, so there's no leading edge or means of getting into tight corners.It can be used as either a steam iron or a steamer. It doesn't have a temperature setting, so if you're using it as an iron delicate fabrics, I'd definitely recommend using a press cloth. If you're using it as a steamer, a press cloth isn't necessary. The steamer does a good job of releasing wrinkles, but you can't get a crisp finish or create creases if using it as a steamer.But speaking of the steamer, I pressed the button expecting to release a shot of steam, but it didn't do that. It steamed continuously, quickly using up the water I'd put in it. I had to refill the water in order to iron a basic short-sleeved blouse. That was surprising & disappointing. It's fine if you're using it as a steamer, but that feature doesn't lend itself to using it as an iron.If I wanted a steamer, I'd have ordered a steamer & I'd expect it to have a hollow, tapered front so I would be able to direct the steam where I want it. I don't think it works well trying to have the device be both an iron & steamer.",
