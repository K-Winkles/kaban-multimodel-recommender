Plus, halfway through my mopping session, the pad would become saturated with water. As a result, the last half of my kitchen always ended up too wet, with noticeable water marks.These additional pads are identical to the one that came with the mop. They are the same size and even have the same pattern. Now, I can mop halfway through, and switch to a fresh pad when the first one becomes too damp! I highly recommend these!",
