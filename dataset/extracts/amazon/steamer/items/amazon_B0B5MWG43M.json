                "reviewText": "I purchased this steam cleaning device primarily for tackling kitchen stove grease, and overall, it impressively lives up to its promise of quick and powerful grease removal. The steam effectively transforms the grease into a milky substance, which is effortlessly wiped away, aligning perfectly with the product description and earning it a 5-star rating.However, there are a couple of concerns I'd like to highlight. Firstly, the water refill port is positioned close to the power input, causing water to frequently come into contact with it. While no accidents have occurred so far, this design raises some safety apprehensions. Secondly, the quality of the hose connecting the cleaning attachment to the machine seems average, and I fear it might wear out or even rupture after multiple uses.In conclusion, this steam cleaning device excels in grease removal, but attention to certain design aspects, such as the proximity of the water refill port to the power input and the durability of the connecting hose, could significantly enhance the overall reliability of the product.",

I had a smaller steam cleaner, which looked like a tea pot, and its reservoir was small; therefore, it needed to be cooled down and filled quite often. This steam cleaner has a larger reservoir and appears to work for over 20 minutes, at least, on one reservoir. I was happy with the purchase. A word of caution -- the steam cleaner is supplied with a long handle, which can get quite hot, so wearing gloves are a must.",

I'm currently doing a resto on a 4 wheeler, it's letting me get to every spot. Other than an initial small burst of HOT water, it's pure steam. It gets in, cleans, and quick dries. No puddles of condensing water.Safety first, wear good gloves.if it's shiny don't touch, trust me I know x6 (yes, I'm the guy that doesn't turn off breakers to work on the electric)",
