We highly recommend using distilled water to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up caused by hard water (tap water). Is it necessary to drain the water and reservoir after each use? It's best practice to drain the excess water from the tank and reservoir to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up. It also prevents water from spilling while in storage. I just got my steamer and the steam hose is really stiff. The hose is made with dual-insulated material to regulate temperature and once you start using your steamer, the hose will become softer. Does it have auto shut-off? It has an auto temperature regulation where it will stop producing more heat once the water runs out, but it will not turn off by itself. How do I attach the steam hose to the steamer? The hose has a double-lock system. First, insert the hose to the unit. Hold the hose from the base and twist it clockwise in 2 full cycles. Once the hose is locked in place, pull the hose up to make sure it's tightly secured before using the steamer.",

The thoughtful design of this steamer is impressive, with every feature carefully considered for ease of use.The hanger holder is a game-changer. It tightens to keep clothes in place, making it easy to steam every inch of the garment without a struggle. The extra-long hose is insulated and reinforced, so you won't burn yourself on it, and the garment rack/steamer holder is adjustable for easy storage. The steamer is on two wheels, making it sturdy yet easy to move around.Using this steamer is a breeze. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, and turn it on. Steam starts flowing in less than a minute, and there's enough steam to remove wrinkles without leaving clothes damp. The steam production is steady, so there's no need to keep stopping or going back over areas.My only complaint is with the instructions. They could have been more detailed, especially when using the steamer and the fabric attachment that goes on the steamer head.Overall, I highly recommend the X3 Commercial Full-Size Garment Steamer. It's a well-designed, easy-to-use steamer that gets the job done without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my business and have been very happy with the performance of this steamer. It's quick to get up to temperature, and the steam flow is very smooth, with very little dripping if you hold the dispenser upright. Assembly was also very easy. Make sure you use distilled water for this machine, which is not always easy to find but Whole Foods tends to have it.",

Was very simple to setup and easy to use\u2026 yes there\u2019s a but. I have owned some of the best irons and steamers over the years. (Sadly even with the best care, they don\u2019t last forever.) Having to wear a pressed uniform to work for 3 decades. So was surprised the water tank doesn\u2019t click or lock in place. Just sits there, easily knocked off. And only one level of steam, no button or lever for more or less power. Still for my needs now I\u2019m thinking it will work just fine. If I have something that needs serious attention I\u2019ll pull out my Rowenta. But this unit can stay in my dressing area without being in the way..",
