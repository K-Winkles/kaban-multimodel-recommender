The original pads come right on without any hand helping but this one seems a little more snug at the attach points in one spot, but nothing you can't fix without just slipping it on with your hand. That's not a deal breaker for me.The quality seems to be similar to the original and functionality is all the same so no issues there.Overall 5 stars for quality and 4 for exact fit.",
