                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this garment steamer. It is simple to use, heats up so fast that you don't waste time and just relaxes the wrinkles out of fabric. The hanger makes it easy to work and is flexible in height. Tall or short people can find a comfortable level that works for any individual. I just love the wheels, the compact size and the ability to wheel this anywhere while I work. It freed me from the laundry room and speeds up the process. It is easy to fill the water chamber and the steam lasts a long time before the next water addition. This steamer is also very kind to fabric and I believe it will make clothes last longer due to avoiding making creases that regular irons make. The same clothes I have been pressing, look better after they are steamed instead. I look more like I send everything out to the dry cleaners, when I actually saved the cost of dry cleaning (which will pay for the machine after a few uses). I like the way they included four levels of heat for all kinds of fabric. Because the base is small and the height is adjustable, this is also very easy to store in a closet, taking up very little space. It's all good.",

                "reviewText": "So I've never owned a steamer so I cant compare or know what's common, normal lolPros: set up was very easy, the color absolutely beautiful, the fact that it has wheel for easy move around access love that lol the fact that I can hang my clothes on their while steaming is also really nice. Never had issues with it tipping over or anything, when in a rush I never struggle with it taking to long to turn on steamer gets going and is ready to use real quick. The size works for us not to small but not super bulky where storing it is hard cleaning is also very easy (use vinegar to clean out every once in a while)Cons; (things that could turn other people away but its perfectly fine for me) the hose thingy does get hot but it wont burn you just gets a little warm, the accessories it comes with is nice and all except it has nowhere to store clip hang so whenever I need them they're usually always missing (thanks to my son) lastly during usage the steamer does make a pretty decent sized puddle around it that I dont really like but have learned to deal with it im sure it may be common with steamers make sense why it would be but I still fully haven't gotten use to that especially when you're running around trying to get everyone ready! But it has never spat water or made a wet spot on any of clothing while steamingOverall it's a great purchase and I'm very happy with it. Steams every diff garment I've tried just fine and it's way easier then an iron now that uve gotten use to it lol. I would reccomend it",

                "reviewText": "The steamer was easy to assemble and to learn how to use. It is easy to fill and heats up super quick. We've been using it on the highest setting and it definitely sends out a lot of steam. So far, we've been using it to steam curtains and it seems to really get the wrinkles out. I wish the hose was just a little longer but it is easy to pick up in one hand and hold the steaming wand with the other.The only thing that I really don't like are the wheels. They seem to be completely useless, meaning...they don't roll at all. When we want to move the steamer from the laundry room to anywhere else, we just have to pick it up and move it around.Even with the wheel issue, we would recommend this steamer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer because of the high ratings it has, and I needed a full sized steamer for my photography business to steam the backdrops I use. Well, was I ever disappointed!It was very easy to put together. Put the hose on and lock it in place. Push the 2 aluminum bars into the slots and attach the top piece with the clothes hanger (which does NOT stay on no matter what you try), then put the handle cradle on.Next came the time to test it out. I put water in the reservoir, not even filling it to the max level because I just wanted to test it out. I plugged it it, turned it to the Cotton setting, which isn't even the highest setting, and waited a few minutes for it to heat up. I started to use it on an old muslin backdrop I had, and it barely worked (I expected a little better, but I didn't have it on the Linen setting, so wasn't upset...it WAS working just slowly). The nozzle was spitting water onto the backdrop, which is not normal for a steamer, but I figured it was the first use, so maybe it needs to be worked in a little bit. Then, I moved the machine and much to my surprise...a BIG puddle of water right under the machine!!! This is NOT normal and completely caught me off guard.OK, well, I thought maybe I did something wrong. So, I unplug the machine and clean up the mess, take the reservoir out, replace it and make sure it's seated right in the housing unit. Then I plug the unit back in and let it heat back up. Well, it still leaked all over the place. Needless to say, this is NOT recommended. Now to see how I go about getting it returned.",
