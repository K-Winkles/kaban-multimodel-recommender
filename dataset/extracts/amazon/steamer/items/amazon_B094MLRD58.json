                "reviewText": "I bought a Conair several years ago that finally died, and I have to say the upgrades added since my last one are incredible. I love that the water tank lasts longer because the steam doesn't come out when the steamer is resting on the stand, but I also gave it a 4 star easy to use rating because I didn't realize this. My box didn't come with instructions, so I was about ready to return it because I had been waiting for the steam to start before I picked up the steamer head. Overall, Conair thought of everything to make this a great product. Highly recommend for home use.",

                "reviewText": "So the pros first.-Does the job perfectly before today. Powerful steam and rids all wrinkles my clothing can muster.Cons:-The attachment parts for the head have manufacturing errors that don't fit and attach to the steamers head. So they are totally useless. No big deal because I don't really need them.-The steamer head developed a rust looking dirt on the steam vent, about two weeks into owning it. Did not develop further and did not interfere with function.-Almost a full year now and the rust looking thing spread like crazy in the past 4 days. Today I turned it on and it started to release a rust color fluid from the steaming vents onto my clothing. I have another conair steamer that is full of calcium build up and that one still functions 100% without any issues despite the build up. It is over 8 years old. Was expecting at least 5 years out of this one for the price it cost me. Now I am looking to see what is happening and how to fix it. I want to retire the old one already but I need a trust worthy replacement. If I am forced to replace this newer one I can't say I trust Conair anymore and will look for another brand and risk it. Without knowing what the rust color abnormalities are, I can't say I recommend this product at all.Bought 09/29/2021 it is now 02/21/2023 and the steamer died. After coughing up the rust looking thing everyday since it started I managed to use it avoiding staining my clothing. Until now, preparing my clothing for work it just, didn't work. Didn't want to steam. I am now switching to an old Conair steamer that looks like it came from some apocalyptic movie, the thing is decades old, that still works. Sad, they don't make them like they use to.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write reviews very often, but I thought this was worthy of one. I used to have the older model and I went through two of them. They were amazing. When my last one broke, I chose to try another brand, which I deeply regretted, so I purchased this newer model of the conair. I hoped it would at least live up to the same standards as the prior model. Fortunately, it exceeded my expectations. I love the new features with this model. It has a bar to clip your clothes that extends out words, which is a nice touch. Also, when you place the handheld device back on the resting spot, it stops the steam automatically. This is a very powerful machine. I purchased it just a few days before my sons wedding. The entire wedding party used it. The gentleman used it to steam their shirts and freshen up there suits and all the ladies used it to eliminate any wrinkles out of their dresses. Everyone told me how amazing this machine was. I would definitely recommend this steamer.",

It was a great convenience gone wrong sadly to say\u2026.Totally happy with my purchase the steamer is so much easier than an iron! Heats up quickly and really gets the wrinkles out!",
