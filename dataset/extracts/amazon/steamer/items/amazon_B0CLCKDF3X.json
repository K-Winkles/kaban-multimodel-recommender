But once I finally got around to putting this steam cleaner together (it comes with a ton of accessories which is both awesome and a tad daunting) it worked pretty well! Before I had just been using a rotating brush only a tad more powerful than a toothbrush so with this steam it cleaned way better than that! However it didn't work miracles like I still have water spots and hard water stains but it did take off a little mildew that was accumulating in my kid's shower.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this portable steamer specifically to clean the tracks in my windows and sliding glass doors. We live on a farm and it is a constant battle for me to keep the dirt cleaned up. Between the animals and the dirt, my floors and surfaces can build up with dirt quickly. I have used this steamer to clean the tracks on the back sliding door twice and both times it has worked well. It has many heads and attachments with brushes that you can use for different jobs. I have not used it for removing stains or anything, so I cannot speak on that, however, I can tell you that it quickly and easily cleaned the tracks on my windows and doors. I love that I can clean without using harsh chemicals to get this dirt up. The steam does all the work! So for me, it works as intended. The only downsides I have found are that the water reservoir is small and that the power cord is short. That does make it a little cumbersome to work with but not a dealbreaker for me. I have purchased a couple handheld steamers in the past and this steamer performs comparatively to them. I think the more I use it and be comfortable with it the better it will be for me.",

The tank isn't very large but lasts a long enough time to clean.I only have a couple complaints about it, most of all is short power cord. It's about 5' long and just isn't enough for many situations. I also wish the lid was secured or latched on. I didn't have a problem with it but it could easily fall off if tipped.",
