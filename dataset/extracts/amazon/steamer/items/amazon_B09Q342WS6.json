It\u2019s perfect for travel but I also love how it\u2019s lightweight and good for everyday use on uniforms. I haven\u2019t found the brush attachment useful but maybe I just haven\u2019t used it correctly. I let it cool how it says so scalding despite daily use. I use distilled water so I can definitely see this steamer lasting me a long time. Very happy with this purchase.",
