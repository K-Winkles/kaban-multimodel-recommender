Only need about 3 minutes to produce pressurized hot steam quickly.\"It does NOT provide continuous steam. Steam comes out in spurts for a few seconds, even when I'm holding the trigger in as hard as I can. Usually it's not even hot enough for steam and spurts warm water and air. Sometimes nothing comes out at all and I have to unplug it, wait for it to cool down and start over to get it to do anything. The instructions on the User's Manual says to let it boil for 5 to 10 minutes. The INDICATOR LIGHT goes off in 3 minutes, but that doesn't mean it's ready.I left a message with the customer support website and I'm waiting to hear back. It was just a simple web form and I don't know what info they need.",

There was residue on some of the parts indicating they were used before. There were no instructions or warranty at all. The unit did heat up but the trigger did not work. No steam would come out when the trigger was pulled. Nothing I could do made this work. After letting it cool I could not remove the cap. It would just turn. Had to use a wrench to relieve the pressure. This is not my first steam cleaner but it will be the last of this brand. Just send a truck to pick it up. I'm not spending time sending it back. I am a partially disabled veteran and cannot just run around returning Broken(New) purchases.I'm surprised that amazon would have a practice of repackaging broken products.Update, Cannot contact decdeal.what a surprise. link dont work.",
