I have owned in the past a portable, handheld steamer, that was very poor in performance. And the first time I used a steamer of this quality was this past February on a cruise ship. I ordered the steamer in order to take the wrinkles out of dresses, but otherwise could not be ironed. I am now using it daily for near everything that I wear plus linens. The unit heats up fairly quickly. The only downside is that it does not get tall enough to hold a full length gown that I may be able to steam from top to bottom. I love the retractable cord and it\u2019s compact ability.",

                "reviewText": "It works consistently well, and after just a few uses the hose becomes flexible and it gets easier. It produces a good amount of steam and quickly. Ive had zero leaks the past few months. It even comes with a mini ironing pad good for collars and pockets.My only complaint is that the clips are absolutely usless. They can't hang anything heavier than a sock and they can't keep clothing clipped together to get specific folds. You are better off using a chip bag clip. But don't think you can use these clips for a bag of chips. Too weak. This is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five. As long as you only intend steam clothing by hand or on a hanger, this is a must buy, as your stuff will turn out great.",

I got a handheld steamer right after to compare and it worked a lot better and faster, this product introduced itself as a professional steamer but it took lots of time or forever to remove wrinkles and it gave up on the stubborn ones. I paid $136 for this and not worth it , spent $35 on the handheld one and found it more effective and useful",
