It was also missing the pads. Not a huge problem. I was going to use cloth diaper liners instead (I can get creative because I'm a mom of 2) I also am fighting terminal brain cancer. Your company wanted it back. I followed all of the instructions. Thank God, it can be picked up for the return because getting it apart was nearly impossible. And thank God that amazon shipped it in a bigger box than the steamer came in. I'm so thankful that it's going to be picked up for return because it would be very hard for me to lug that huge box and my toddler to return it. I will be more careful about doing business with 3rd party sellers from now on. Buyer beware. I don't recommend.",

The Dupray one was too heavy and hard to move because of its long cables and hoses. Plus, it took 15 minutes to get hot. This one gets ready in seconds. For folks with laminate wood floors, this one's a winner.",
