I use it on clients when I want to open up the pores of their scalp for Micro-needling treatments. I also use it to steam my face before I do a facial mask. I know I know. I love to sit and watch It bubble away as a tenders back-and-forth, it's kind of funny. It was such a inexpensive item and it works great. And yes, I have actually used it to steam a couple of shirts. It's perfect pack in my kit for work. As I am a hair, makeup and wardrobe stylist. This is a definite buy.",

I use it in a commercial alteration shop to remove chalk marks from items as well as to smoothen out wrinkles easily fast and at a great price. I have had the larger steamers and either they take 15-plus minutes to warm up the water or they break down. better than iron steamers as well. the best bang for your buck!",
