                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer because I love thrift store shopping. Anyone who's been to a thrift store may already know that you can expect a strange odor from anything and everything you bring home. Since I \"upcycle\" most of the things I buy, I wanted to kill two birds with one stone; eliminate odors as well as pressing the fabric for easy deconstruction.My steamer came about a month ago and I've used it a handful of times for about 40 min to an hour every time. I am very pleased with the construction, all of the pieces and parts look well made and are fully functional. The foam pad was squished pretty badly in the box but it popped back to life in about 5 days. I must admit, I the steam definitely helps the thrift store stank but does not remove it completely, it almost seems to go away and then once the garment is cool again it comes back very slightly.I did have concerns before making my purchase, one review said that the steamer squirts hot water randomly and could wet the garment or burn the operator. Within about 10 minutes of using the steamer I figured out what happens. With the buildup of steam and condensation coating the rubber tube after using the steamer for a few minutes, this water will travel to the lowest point and sit there. The continuous pressure from the steam still being made by the machine will push the hot water out the hose with enough buildup. To remedy the situation, one just needs to make the hose straight again every few minutes by lifting the steam head high up, allowing the water buildup to drop back down into the tank. The steamer makes a noise before it shoots water out so it's easy to anticipate. SCIENCE.As far as taking wrinkles out of fabric, it works great. I would recommend this for anyone who has regular household needs. I really only need to use it about twice a week for maybe an hour. Although it would work for a shop or for someone with higher volume of steaming to do, the item was clearly designed for clothing, the range of motion allowed by the hose and extension cord are not extensive- you really can't hang something longer than the extendo-holdy pole.Overall, a great product, the only thing I might change about it is weighting the base more because as you steam, your tank becomes lighter and lighter and very thick heavy fabrics may not be held up by it anymore.",

                "reviewText": "Had this unit for a couple of months now and use it a couple of times per week. Over all I am pleased with it. While it will not replace an iron for pressing purposes it does do a good job at steaming wrinkles from most fabrics. Which is convenient considering that is what it is suppose to do, heh.**Good points**1) The water heats up to steam level quickly. I rarely wait more than 60 seconds, or so, for steam build up.2) The steam is a steady adequate flow once going. It rarely spurts out hot water (until other home steamers I've tried).3) Once turned off the water cools down relatively quickly and thus the steam flow from the \"sitting\" unit stops shortly after power off.4) The base is light weight but heavy enough that my clothes don't cause it to tip when they are hanging from the fully extended pole. Unless I do something stupid like hang way too many clothes off the pole for some reason (did that once, don't know why, hah).5) I have yet to see any significant mineral build up. Though arguably I only use the steamer for a few minutes 2-3 times a week.**General points (not bad but not spectacular either)**1) The hose, while perfectly long enough for articles hanging from the extended pole, will not reach the top of hanging high level drapes. As this is a floor model and not designed to be lifted that makes steaming said drapes difficult without first taking them down. Nothing horrible, just thought the hose length should be noted.2) This item works well for a home steamer. The \"home\" moniker should be noted, as it does not produce powerful industrial steam flow. And as such will not replace an iron for very thick/stubborn fabrics (even when using the included backing pad).**Bad points**1) nothing negative has come up yet.Overall, I have been very pleased with this home steamer and found it to be an excellent purchase. It is a well priced (maybe even cheap) unit that still produces good results with no noted negatives so far.",
