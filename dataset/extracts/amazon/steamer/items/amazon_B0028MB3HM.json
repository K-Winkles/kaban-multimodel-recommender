                "reviewText": "I've had my Shark now for over two years and it's still going strong! I was honestly nervous after receiving my steam mop because it did feel a little flimsy. However, that being said...it would be tiring to use a heavy solid mop that holds added weight in water! We decided to go with the steam for several reasons but first, because my daughter suffers from severe allergies! This mop uses no cleaners and does a much better job than a traditional mop and bucket. I also liked the \"green\" factor of no cleaner and washable pads. I have washed and reused the cleaning pads too many times to count and not a single one of them is showing any signs of wear!! (not counting some staining of course) Also, one of my daughters accidentally dropped my Shark down the basement stairs and cracked the plastic housing...didn't effect the mop in the least. It feels no flimsier and hasn't worsened as I've continued using it...and it doesn't leak. It's plastic...I don't blame the mop for breaking when the same daughter dropped my cast iron pan down the same stairs and that also broke ;) We have finished hardwood floors, laminate floors, tiled floors, Allure floors and oiled pine floors...this mop works wonderfully on every one of them! I've used it to remove general dirt and grime, sticky nasties, wax, crayon, marker, paint, wood stove ash residue, unidentifiable kid & pet surprises and numerous food spills all with great success! I have recommended this mop several times and will do so several more times I'm sure! The only drawback, by the way, to steam mopping is during peak humid summer weather, although the added humidity during the dry winter months is great! ;)***UPDATE***Sadly my Shark pocket mop finally died :( It stopped making steam after 4 years! My super handy husband popped it open and removed one tiny little part and it worked again...but only for a couple more moppings. So...after four years of using the daylights out of it I am back to buy a new mop...just an FYI in those four years we have had 8 children, 2 adults, several animals and countless house guests traipsing in and out! I did the research...I read the reviews...I compared prices. For the money...I am buying another Shark Pocket Mop!Things I've learned...I originally bought the mop with several heads. I only used the rectangular one. I have an open floor plan so if you have tight spaces the triangular head may work better for you. I didn't use the carpet attachment either...with my daughter's allergies we got rid of all our carpeting...which means our entire house is bare, steam-moppable floors...this mop gets USED! Our house is not large...28x26, two and a half levels with moppable floors with a mostly open floor plan. The cord reached every area from one central outlet.**UPDATE** The cord on the new mop is shorter than the old one. I was disappointed, but it still mops the same...only now I have to move the plug to more than one outlet...not a deal-breaker for me** I also never had to buy replacement pads in the four years I've owned them! They are no longer white...but they still work beautifully! I occasionally tried the big purple fluffy pad that came with mine but I wasn't totally thrilled with it...maybe because it took longer to wet enough to clean with...admittedly I just want to get mopped and be done ASAP. If I came across an especially hard spot to get clean I simply (with shoes on!) stepped on the head and applied pressure and steam for several seconds and rarely had anything not come up...even cooled candle wax :) Most other mops don't look like you could step on the head without damaging it.By far my favorite feature is the reversible mopping surface! I mop half of one level (it actually could do more) then simply flip the mop over to mop the rest with the clean side! LOVE that! No changing scalding hot pads part way through a mop job or waiting for it to cool down enough to change it! I also got one level done on one tank of water with some left over :) AND...even though it said to use distilled water I never did....I used straight well water from the tap...and we have high iron in our water. I am most definitely a fan...especially for a price that's nearly half of many of the other steam mops out there!I am sorry that some other reviewers did not have the same experience I have had. I understand that this is an electronic appliance. My new one may have a manufacturing flaw that my old one didn't. You will get that with ANY electronic device...some will be flawless...others DOA. A definite pain, but for this mop, in my opinion...well worth the risk :) FOUR years...and 3 months to be exact! I totally got my money's worth!",

I don't want a wet mop head sitting around. I don't want to deal with a wet floor, or slopping semi-dirty water back onto the floor. I don't want to deal with any of that. With this, I don't have to! Super easy to use. Very effective. It's actually almost entertaining to watch the floor get clean. Minimal aftercare necessary. Simply find a place for the dirty pad to dry. You get two, so you have a backup and can wash them both at once. The floor doesn't stay wet at all. The pad turns black. It's amazing.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE this STEAM MOP ... even WORKS like the INFOMERCIAL!",
                "reviewText": "A couple of weeks ago, I hesitantly purchased (directly from Amazon) the Euro-Pro Shark Steam Pocket Mop ... but I am SO glad I did. I LOVE this steam mop. I have TILE and WOOD floors throughout my house and they have been nearly impossible to keep clean (as evidenced by my kids' no-so-white sock bottoms). Anyway, I had been researching all of the various steam mops trying to find that \"perfect\" mop that would work miracles. I thought I had decided on one, but then (while flipping channels) saw the infomercial for this mop. It appeared to be EXACTLY what I was looking for. As with most infomercials, I was VERY skeptical that the product would REALLY do what it claimed to do. Luckily, I took the leap of faith, and purchased one from Amazon.com. I could not be happier with this mop. It REALLY does STEAM (alot) and get all of the gross built up dirt and grime off the floors.I HATE cleaning floors! I'm more of a carpet person, so for me to say I love this product is absolutely amazing. I had a Hoover FloorMate (which I purchased 7 years ago), but it was ALOT of effort to clean up AFTER ... and it only had the brush scrubbers (so it didn't really WIPE the floors clean) AND it required the special Hoover cleaner (which I ruined mine by using Pine Sol ... which it specifically says not to use). Then I moved to the cheaper (although, not really after you buy all of the disposable pads and cleaner) Swiffer Wet Jet. It was ok for the quick clean-ups, IF my floor was already pretty much clean to begin with. But the Swiffer Wet Jet never CLEANED my floors. It was EXTREMELY frustrating to spend time and money cleaning and then STILL see the dirty sock bottoms (which meant the floors weren't really clean).PLEASE NOTE: There are TWO (2) versions of the NEWER MODEL steam mop ... the PURPLE version has 2 heads (rectangle and triangle) with 5 PADS (2 rectangle, 2 triangle, 1 purple duster) and the SILVER/metallic version has 3 heads (XL rectangle, rectangle and triangle) and 4 PADS (1 XL rectangle, 1 rectangle, 1 triangle, 1 purple duster). Both have the carpet glider. The XL kit, as well as extra PADS can all be purchased separately. I bought mine at Newegg.The things I like about the Euro Pro Shark Steam Pocket Mop are ...1. It has a LONG 30ft. cord so you are not constantly plugging and unplugging,2. It has sturdy/thick microfiber washable/reusable TWO-SIDED pads,3. It has a LARGE water tank, so you are not constantly re-filling the tank,4. It has a SWIVEL head (3 different HEAD sizes/shapes) that FLIPS for two-sided cleaning,5. It really STEAMS while cleaning and gets off the built on dirt,6. It cleans WITHOUT any chemicals ... only tap water (I prefer using hot water),7. It HEATS up quickly (under a minute ... although I usually let it heat for 5 minutes).Things you should know ...1. As with mopping, you need to vacuum or sweep BEFORE steam mopping (do this WHILE the mop is heating up).2. Filling with hot water worked best for me.3. PUMP/prime the mop about 10 times before you start mopping (this gets the STEAM really going).4. Make sure you have AT LEAST 2 pads (4-sides of cleaning), especially if your floors are dirty.5. Do NOT keep using the same pad side once it is dirty (so, check the bottom as you go) or your floors will not be cleaned and look streaky when they dry.6. I don't *think* this mop actually gets hot enough to really sanitize (I'm not sure if any of them do), but I spray/squirt some vinegar on the floor as I go and mop over that and it seems to work.Overall, I am VERY HAPPY with this mop! Actually, don't mind (as much) cleaning the floors now ... since they do truly get clean!UPDATE April 2011: My mop is still working fine with no issues (thank goodness). The pads are heavily stained (even Clorox won't get the stains out) and have started to wear through and need to be replaced. [...] I am still using mine and happy with the results, but am now a little more cautious.",

I am so happy to never have to use a traditional mop and bucket again.The cord is a little short, so I had to plug it into several different outlets. It also kind of had a wet dog smell that I think was just a result of the steam on the mop pad. Hopefully it will be better after the pads have been washed. But the smell didn\u2019t linger or come up from the floor. The mop head was very dark with dirt (don\u2019t judge. Lol) so it worked very well!!! So happy",

Me decid\u00ed a adquirirla, por lo cual no qued\u00e9 decpecionado. Mi esposa y yo decidimos darle un pre tratamiento al piso de cer\u00e1mica y sobre todo a las juntas del piso, que estaban muy manchados de polvo y suciedad de mis perritas (lavamos y tallamos con la escoba la soluci\u00f3n de agua y detergente). Posteriormente pasamos esta fregona de vapor de agua y ayud\u00f3 a desmanchar peque\u00f1as suciedades y lo m\u00e1s importante en nuestro tipo de piso (un aspecto de brillante).Tambi\u00e9n me gusta, ya que es bactericida por el vapor que genera el suministro y pueden agregar unas gotas de esencia de su aroma preferido si gustan aromatizar, no se que tan recomedable sea eso para el dep\u00f3sito de agua, pero es sensacional.Se\u00f1alo que vivo cerca de una \u00e1rea agricola y tengo dos mascotas que sueltan mucho pelo, as\u00ed que cumple bastante su funci\u00f3n, no le pide nada a otras fregonas de mayor precio. No esperen a que desmanche su piso por completo, ya que no es la funci\u00f3n principal del art\u00edculo. Ahorrar\u00e1n dinero en productos qu\u00edmicos para limpieza de sus pisos.El tip es que el mango de donde se sostiene se tiene que hacer un tipo bombeo de adentro hacia afuera, para habilitar el mecanismo de vapor. Cuidado con esto.Feliz con la compra y a un precio razonable.",
