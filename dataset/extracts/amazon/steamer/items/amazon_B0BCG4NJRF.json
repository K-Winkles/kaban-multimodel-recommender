                "reviewText": "This steamer checks all the boxes:\u2611 Ready as soon as you turn it on. Literally, it shoots steam the moment you flip the switch.\u2611 Incredibly efficient. Unlike smaller steamers, this one takes one pass.\u2611 Multiple steaming intensity modes: Red light (high), Blue light (medium), Green light (low). Tip: Just use the low intensity mode (Green light), the water lasts a lot longer that way and the wrinkles still come off very, very easy.\u2611 Comfortable switch to turn On and Off. When I'm changing garments to steam, turning off the steamer saves water, so that's fewer trips to the sink to refill the tank.\u2611 Refilling the tank is very easy. The opening to refill the tank is big enough to easily fill it up in the sink without using the provided cup.\u2611 The largest capacity tank of the traveling steamers I found here on Amazon. This means, fewer trips to the sink to refill.Notes:\u2014 After about 30 minutes of use, the top of the handle, the \u201cneck\u201d that meets the steaming head, gets quite hot, so you will need to adjust your grip a little lower.\u2014 It can get heavy after a while of using it.Very satisfied with this steamer.",

Surprisingly, it's easy to use, with fast heat-up to remove wrinkles instantly, making ironing clothes flat much easier than with a traditional iron. No need to worry about wrinkles anymore.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer because I was sick of ironing my clothes and it's worked like a charm. I used it on a dress with a full circle skirt and the wrinkles fell right out after I let the steamer heat up for a minute like the directions saidThe handle didn't get hot when I was using the steamer, which was a plus. Some irons get toasty when they're on for a while, so I was a little apprehensive, but it worked out just fine. The steam came out in a predictable direction, too, so I didn't have to worry about burning myself. I liked how you can select a continuous stream or do bursts of steam with the toggle on the front of the handleI haven't used the brush attachment yet, so I can't speak for that, but the pad worked very well. I liked the mesh pocket on the back that I could slip my hand into and navigate it around my garment. The beaker was also really helpful for filling the reservoir; the tip fit the hole at the top of the reservoir perfectly so it was easy to fill and I didn't spill. The carrying bag fits everything, too, which is nice, but the directions say to store the steamer in a standing position, so I just keep the accessories in the bag next to the steamerThe only complaint I have is that the cord feels really, really short. I accidentally pulled it out from the wall a couple times when I was steaming my dress. I also steamed some curtains and I couldn't get to the top of them with the steamer because the cord didn't reach",

                "reviewText": "I have not yet been able to fully discover it\u2019s potential, having just received it in past couple of days. What I can say is that it came beautifully packaged and has wonderful instructions for use, the best I\u2019ve ever seen. I was curious and put it together very quickly and easily. I tried it out on a dress that was very wrinkled. I was very cautious about how much steam to use on the dress that clearly stated, dry clean only. As a result I did not get the result I hoped for as I was afraid to ruin it.I next used it on a bedspread and it worked beautifully. On the Con side I found as others had, that the water reservoir opening was a bit too small but with the adjustment of water flow it posed no real problem. Another minor thing I discovered was that the brush attachment didn\u2019t stay attached very securely. Other than what I mentioned, I found it to be very comfortable to handle, very well designed and I hope to be able to put it to good use in many different ways. I will update the review of this product after a reasonable amount of use.",
