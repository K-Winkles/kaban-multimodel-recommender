I was running short on time and thought I should check out this steamer. After reading the instructions, I put the correct amount of water in the steamer. It didn't take as much water as I thought it would. After the steamer warmed up a short few mins, I was able to steam out the wrinkles... This steamer worked well beyond my expectations...!",

This little travel steamer is actually the best one I have tried so far! My husband kept saying\u2014you need to be sure and do a review (as he watched me steaming a dress shirt for my son). Understanding it\u2019s for travel-the water capacity is kind of small but surprisingly I only refilled water once to do his full long sleeve button up dress shirt. Would definitely recommend\u2014great value and would be a good gift for travelers. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I picked up this steam iron since I like the small size and portability for travel. I also like that it can be used with steam or without. I have the green one - the color is a deep jade. The water well is small, so I filled it twice to steam a suit jacket, but that's too be expected for a travel iron, and it was easy to fill with the included cup. It comes with a plate to sit on, which came in very handy once the steamer was hot and I needed to place it down for a moment to change the position of the jacket. The steam is very powerful, which was not always the case with all of the steam irons I've tried. I have had a handful of steam irons in the past and most of them have not lasted very long so we'll see how this one does and I can update my review. I plan to take this with me on some upcoming trips. My only complaint is that this steam iron already had water droplets in the tank as if someone had used it and returned it. It still works but it would have been nice to receive one that hadn't been used already or that was cleaned out before it was sent out again. Nothing in the manual indicated that water should already be in the tank.",
