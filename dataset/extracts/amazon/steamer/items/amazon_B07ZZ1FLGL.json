                "reviewText": "I purchased these a month ago and use them daily. They are starting to thin out especially around the area where the steam comes out of my mop. I believe this is do to how tight you have to pull them to get them secured to the mop. You have to essentially stretch them until they Velcro which is not always easy. This could be fixed if the Velcro strip was half an inch wider. Otherwise they pick up dirt as intended and wash well.",
