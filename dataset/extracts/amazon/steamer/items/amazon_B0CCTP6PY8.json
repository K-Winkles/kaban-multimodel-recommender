                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The SteamMaster's triple brush design impressed me with its versatility, effortlessly handling various surfaces and stains. The high-pressure steam capability ensured a thorough, chemical-free clean, promoting an eco-friendly approach. Portability was a breeze, thanks to its compact design and quick heat-up time. The durable build and user-friendly controls make it a reliable cleaning companion.It does come with a set of gloves and also different nozzles incldg. metal bristled ones to clean.However, few things to note1. as you can see from 3rd picture if by any chance you loosen up the tube where it connects to the base unit, you will have to remove the screws to tighten the coupling net and pull the tube back again. It is constricted and a pain- so be careful about it.2. Be sure to use the gloves as the metal wand gets *really* hot and can scald you if you are not careful.3. You might be better off using water that has less dissolved solids ( aka less hardness) as it might calcify quickly. Be sure to empty the unit and also clean it up for storage.I, for myself prefer using steam cleaning and not use harsh chemicals while cleaning. Though, the unit does mention that you can add cleaning chemicals ( vinegar ?) while using it.In summary, the SteamMaster combines efficiency, versatility, and eco-friendliness in a compact package, earning its place as my go-to cleaning solution.- 4 stars because of the issue mentioned above",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I must say, this steamer has introduced a refreshing change to my cleaning routine. I gave it a whirl around my sink area, and it effortlessly tackled grime without the need for extra scrubbing. Don't miss the video to witness how effectively it cleans grout as well!Using the machine is a breeze: simply fill it with water, power it on, and select the desired level (ranging from 0 to 6). It also comes with several useful attachments and a pair of gloves to keep your hands protected during operation. I appreciate how neatly it can be stored in a small box, which can be tucked away on a shelf when not in use.One thing to note is that it tends to leave a significant amount of water behind, which required me to return with a towel to mop it up. I'm not entirely certain if this is a result of improper use or if other steam cleaners share a similar issue. Nevertheless, it's a powerful cleaning tool worth considering.",
