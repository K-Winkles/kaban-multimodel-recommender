I am going to be moving soon so for now it will work until I get my new washer and dryer but I would return if I had to use it longer than a month. The steam kinda seems like it barely comes out and oddly it seems to release more steam and gets hotter towards the end when the water is running out. I attached a before and after. Like it said it does work, just not very powerful.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this steamer to steam the wrinkles out of photography backdrops, and while it did product steam it was also capable of spouting water out of the steam holes, leaving stains on these backdrops that were a pain to steam out a second time. The steamer also gets too hot, and melted some of the attachments that were included. Save your money and pick up something a little higher quality.",
