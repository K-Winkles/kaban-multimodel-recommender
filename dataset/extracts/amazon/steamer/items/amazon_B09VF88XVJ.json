Once all the pads are dirty I toss all the pads into my washer and let the washer clean the pads. Ezzy Peezy You don't need to dry the pads. They will air dry on their own. I would not put the pads into a dryer because the heat might distort the plastic velcro piece on the back of the cleaning pad.",

The question is do they get your floors clean?The answer is yes. My floors are perfectly clean. And while I cannot get the pads as clean looking as they were when I bought them, they are cleaner after I\u2019ve washed them and I use them over and over again.",
