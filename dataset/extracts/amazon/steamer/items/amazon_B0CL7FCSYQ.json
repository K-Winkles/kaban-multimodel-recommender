                "reviewText": "Safety First; Remember, you are dealing with extremely hot steam. Please keep children and pets out of the area while using. This is very easy to set up and use. You basically just add water and turn on. You have an extension wand and 2 sets of 3 different brush heads you can use. ( small brass, and large and small nylon bristles.) They also throw in some replacement gaskets for the wand. Bonus items include a small swatch of cloth, which I just use to wipe off the machine with. A small pair of gardening gloves, which I can't use because they're too small, but might fit someone. And a nylon apron to protect your cloths. I wear old cloths when I clean, so i'll probably get more use of that when I'm in the kitchen. I'm not complaining - I think it's nice they included some bonus items. There is a dial on the top to adjust how much steam is spraying. The base holds plenty of water. I have yet to run out during a job, but I tend to tackle one main job at a time. Pro tip; use distilled water to eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, any scaling build up. I have a Zero Water pitcher for drinking water that I use and haven't had any plugging/build up yet. If you do, just mix water and vinegar and use for a while to clean out the internals.",

                "reviewText": "I used this in my kitchen the day after Christmas. It is terrific at getting sticky or greasy/ dusty things clean, but its not a miracle. It did nothing for the tiny bit of mildew around the base of my kitchen faucet, but it made cleaning the stove top, the oven and the microwave a breeze. It is very lightweight. I only filled it twice, and I spent a good half hour playing with it before my arm started to get tired and I was done for the day. It was cold in my kitchen, and the granite counters felt cold immediately after using, but I tested it on a cotton towel and it is indeed hot steam coming out. I really wanted to try it on my sliding glass doors, but I will have to wait for a much warmer day. I still needed to use soap and a sponge for most items, but this still cut down my cleaning time dramatically. And it was fun to use.",

                "reviewText": "I got This little compact steamer for my trucks plastic interior and after market rubber floor mats. This worked like a charm to get all the nasty buildup of dirt and grime that didn't want to come off with simple soap and water scrubbing and red clay mud that seemed to stain the door and floor mat but this took it off with a breeze. Now my cars interior looks almost professionally done with this mini steamer. just be careful when starting up because it trickles water in the beginning as its heating up and I didn't get close to any electric switches or speaker housing due to fear of shorting them. All in all very satisfied with this small steamer.",
