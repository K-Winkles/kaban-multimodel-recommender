Not a fan! Increase the size of the water tank please!#2 when holding it I keep accidentally pressing the button to stop the steam. needs a different location for that button#3.

Do be aware though that clicking on the blue or red color options in Amazon's listing, instead of the original black, don't just change the color of the product that you will receive. They are listings for a completely different and lower wattage, less adjustable and less powerful steamer. Stick with the black version and you will be a lot happier with the product.",

The head of this thing is like a super-big driver like you'd use on a golf course. then, beneath that, there's a handle, and finally, the base. I couldn't imagine lugging this thing with me on a trip. I'll just use the iron in the hotels.Works great otherwise, though.Oh, and the cord is quite long. Great for use, not so great for storage.",

Con el nivel turbo las prendas de mezclina y pana, se desarrugan muy f\u00e1cilmente. El vapor es intenso y continuo. Yo cuelgo la prenda en la superficie plana y s\u00f3lida para facilitar la tarea. El vaporizador es un poco pesado, pero considerando su excelente funcionamiento, a mi no me molesta, solo me lo paso de una mano a otra. C\u00f3mo indica en el instructivo, esta hecho para uso dom\u00e9stico, por lo que el tanque del agua es peque\u00f1o y en promedio alcanza para desarrugar de 2 a 3 prendas, dependiendo del material y el nivel de arrugado. Yo solo lo uso hasta que el tanque se vac\u00eda. Lo dejo enfr\u00edas por completo unas horas y m\u00e1s tarde lo vuelvo a llenar y a usar hasta vaciar, y despu\u00e9s lo vuelvo a dejar enfr\u00edar. C\u00f3mo m\u00e1ximo hago esto tres veces durante un d\u00eda, pero no lo uso todos los d\u00edas. Lo he tenido por un par de semanas y estoy muy feliz con esta compra. En verdad se los recomiendo much\u00edsimo. La siguiente vez que lo use tomar\u00e9 una foto y/o video y lo pondr\u00e9 aqu\u00ed.",
