                "reviewText": "I had never used a steamer before and was just a bit hesitant to try it, but I purchased some items that could not be ironed and arrived extremely wrinkled, so this was the obvious and perfect solution for me! The instructions are very straight forward and clear. It is easy to use safely, and I found it to be totally effective. Depending on how badly wrinkled your items are, you may end up having to fill the water reservoir multiple times, but that, too, is quick and easy. I absolutely recommend it! (And I LOVE my yellow one! Fantastic and cheerful color.) Oh, it was also easy to register the warranty.",

                "reviewText": "I am so incredibly impressed by this little machine. The thick hem on the 100% cotton (lavender denim) mini skirt that I own always is flipped one way or another via a huge wrinkle, but I was able to smooth it out with this! I really believe that was the ultimate test (for what I need the steamer for) because I was convinced only an iron would take out that giant wrinkle. Nope! Had to go over it several times to get it out, but it didn't take too long and it was super satisfying to see it all flatten out. In the past, I've been a chronic wrinkly-clothes person, not thinking TOO too much of it (a lot of my clothes are stuffed in drawers, albeit folded), but feeling insecure at times when things seemed to be a little *too* wrinkly. As I'm now in my 30s, I all of the sudden find it very important. I think it's quite classy to have nicely pressed/steamed clothes, and I feel more comfortable and fashionable now that I own this and it's even cooler that it takes up very little room and I can bring it with me (to the office, or away at a conference for work, for example), if need be! I take a lot of pride in my how I choose to dress myself and have noticed that wrinkly and creased clothes make me feel off, so this has been the cherry on top to make each outfit look more put together. :) Highly recommend this very easy to use product. I have caught myself with the steam a couple of times, but that's user error. I would not recommend (AT ALL) putting this directly anywhere near your face, but if you happen to catch some steam from afar, it's almost like you're also getting a little face treatment in addition to the clothes steaming!",

                "reviewText": "We have been dealing with having wrinkly clothes for a bit living on the road and hadn't gotten any sort of iron to resolve it. We decided with this handheld steamer because it's smaller and lightweight but also is steaming and de-linting when needed. This has been such a game changer for us. We love it. It's so easy to use and then it stores easily, too. Absolutely love this and wish we'd gotten it sooner.",

I\u2019m steaming everything- jeans, t-shirts, pajamas\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have this much fun. It\u2019s definitely worth the $35-40, so if you\u2019re like me and have to read reviews for 75 different options before making a decision- I\u2019ll save you the time. This one is good!",

I LOVE THIS THING!! It works perfectly, is easy to use and my clothes look awesome!!The only small negative is that the water canister could be bigger, I steamed 4 shirts and a blazer and had to refill it 3 times, but that\u2019s not a big deal at all, as it\u2019s smaller size will make it great for travelling. If you want a steamer, but this one!",

Water reservoir is only limitation if you need to do a lot of clothes, but it's so quick to pop it off and fill it up it almost isn't a limitation.",

Works very well, does a great job, but what is frustrating is how small the water reservoir is. You steam one shirt and half a trouser and it's empty. Size is big, and when you consider its size, including handle, it makes a big chunky item in your suitcase. Some other products (Philips?) have a foldable handle and a bigger reservoir. That would be my other choice, but all in all, a good product that works well.",
