There was very little water droplets. It worked ok on a blouse and dress. I don\u2019t use it that often but I will take it with me when I travel. B.D. Dallas,Yx",

My first time using it, it worked for approximately 10-15 minutes and then water starting leaking out the back where the electrical cord is. This was definitely a safety hazard since I did not realize why it wasn\u2019t working till 5 minutes later. I could have been electrocuted because the water was slowly leaking out right on top of the cord while it was still plugged in. I definitely don\u2019t recommend buying this product and I wish I could get my money back, but unfortunately I can\u2019t since it\u2019s past the refund window.",
