Adding a pull tab at one of the corners would help this, so I may see one on to test that. They work as expected and have yet to show signs of wear after weekly use for almost 4 months. Definitely make sure they are air dried (as with all steam mop pads) so they don't shrink. I will definitely repurchase when needed.",

Unfortunately for me, right after I bought them and only used one, my Bissell steam mop quit working. Only used it 4x, now it won\u2019t even turn on. Don\u2019t buy Bissell, buy something that will actually work for more than a few uses. Now that I\u2019ve searched more reviews online, I realize the mop is just an overpriced piece of junk. Extremely disappointing, since I was really liked it the few times I got to use it. Of course companies don\u2019t stand behind their products anymore and they won\u2019t fix or replace it, so I\u2019m out $$ for a steam mop and replacement pads I\u2019ll never get to use\u2026 since I\u2019m certainly not going to waste even more money for a new one I\u2019m sure will also quit working. Too bad you can\u2019t get replies on reviews, I\u2019d love to send these perfectly good unused pads to someone who can actually use them. No problem with this product, it\u2019s just the steam mop they\u2019re made for is a piece of junk. :(",
