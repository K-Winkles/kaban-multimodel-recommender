                "reviewText": "This steamer works well and is easy to use. It is light weight and comfortable to hold. It comes with a diffusing shield for clothing and a brush for things like furniture, carpets, etc.The water reservoir is small, but hold enough to generate a lot of steam; plenty for two or three garments. The hole for adding water is very small making it a bit of a challenge to fill without spilling. No worries, just fill it over the sink.The steamer heats up very quickly, going from off to generating steam in under 30 seconds.One short-coming of this unit is the instructions. There is useful information in there, along with some utter nonsense. For example: \"....turned to the second gear to emit steam for wet soup operation\"., and this puzzler, \"Prevent steam burns by spraying steam onto hands\".Finally, IMO this steamer (and all others) represent a very real risk for severe burns. Steam does not forgive a mistake. All possible safety measures should be observed.I like this steamer and, if used with the proper precautions, I recommend it.",

Heats up and starts working very quickly and works just a well if not better then another much more expensive one I have! Love that it comes with some different accessories like a mitt to protect you hand and 2 streamer attachments.",

I wear a lot of fancy dresses and skirts that wrinkle in a flash but don't need cleaning, but I feel like this steamer will iron and clean, which I like! I am looking forward to all the nice, steamed clothes I am going to have in the future.",

                "reviewText": "This handheld steamer is very efficient. It works very well and fast. The steamer heats up in less than 20 seconds and does excellent work removing all the wrinkles without leaving any water stains. The steamer is lightweight and the quality is excellent. Very durable. The only downside is that it's a little bigger than I expected so it does take some room to store it.",
