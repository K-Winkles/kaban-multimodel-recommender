I used it to clean an old exersaucer from my 2-year old for my 6-month old and the bouncer looks brand new (excluding the seat cover which was machine-washed). There\u2019s a safety function to keep the lid closed when water shouldn\u2019t be added or it\u2019s very hot. It will act as a continuous spinning mechanism until all the steam/water has been used. Be sure to let it cool down before adding water when the cap is released or it will boil out of the top and spray everywhere. I made this mistake while paying more attention to what my toddler was doing than the heated tool in my hand. Overall, this is a great buy and was very affordable.",
