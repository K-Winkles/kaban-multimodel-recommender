Unfortunately, in my experience they tend to last about 1 - 1\u00bd years. Although I attribute the lifespans toy usage of tap water and not the recommended bottled water.This is a decent unit. Its a little heavy but the steam comes out sttong. It heats up quickly. It doesn't splurt hot water. It gets the job done, but it doesn't get rid of the wrinkles as well or as quickly as other units that I've owned.Overall, it's a good and sturdy clothing steamer.",

Well, like 6 or so months ago it broke and my life was turned upside down. I have no idea which brand it was but it did have a stand and was on wheels. So, I tried to search for a replacement and I was too cheap to buy the nice one with the stand again so I settled on this guy. I figured it would take up less space and the quality should be the same because it's JUST a steamer, amiright? WRONG. This one is small but its still kinda bulky. The little canister is well, little and it just doesn't pump out as much juice as the old guy did. The other one was a one hitter and here I am throwing multiple swipes for the same result. Maybe I was just spoiled. This one is fine if you're a steamer newbie but if you're looking to upgrade I would suggest the mac daddy.",
