                "reviewText": "This steamer works pretty well. I filled the tank halfway and ran it for the first time in my shower to test it out first. The instructions say to run it into air the first time to run off any manufacturing chemicals- like what would happen with any new appliance that heats up. But the smell wasn\u2019t bad I barely noticed.It shoots out a good amount of steam and has about a 4 foot reach. You hear a slight clicking noise as the straw in the water tank sucks up water but it\u2019s pretty quiet. The cord base is on a swivel ball so it\u2019s easy to move the device around when in use. A nice feature is that the trigger handle can lock in place so you don\u2019t have to hold it down with your finger while doing large areas. With about half a tank of water it lasted about 20 minutes, maybe a little longer I didn\u2019t time it, but it did seem like a long time. If you were doing curtains you could probably get most of them done in your house in one go. It did turn itself off after it ran out of water. The entire head of this device does get hot, clear down to right above the handle. But it\u2019s not hot enough to burn you like it can still be touched safely- except the front part of course. This is a great steamer and I\u2019m glad I got it!",
