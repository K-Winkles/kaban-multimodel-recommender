                "reviewText": "I just now ordered my second OXO steamer basket after an accident. The story: after dinner I washed my 4-quart cooking pan and the OXO steamer I use with it together, then sat them on a heated burner for a couple of minutes to dry out so I could put them away together. I love that the steamer folds and closes down and fits all my pans just about. Anyway, tonight I forgot and went into another room and watched a movie. Suddenly the smoke alarms went off! The apartment was smoky. In the kitchen the pan was sitting on a red-hot burner, cooking away. I had to put on a Covid mask in order to navigate as the air was awful and my throat, eyes, and nose were burning. I opened windows and turned on a fan full blast and shut the bedroom door where my cat was sleeping (and thankfully didn't beathe any of this foul air.) In a while the kitchen was cleared and the smoke dissipated. The OXO's plastic top was GONE! Nothing remained--I think that's mainly what I was breathing/smelling. The pan was shot, too. Metal was oozing out from a seam in the bottom and collecing on the burner. It hardened and looked like lump of hardened mercury but maybe was aluminum. I don't know. I just know that I found myself out of two things I use just about every day. I just ordered a new pan and a new OXO--I have to have these two for all the veggies I steam along with fish sometimes, plus other goodies. I love that the OXO has nice long legs. I see I ordered the first one over two years ago--so it's lasted a good while and until tonight was in geat shape. I learned my lesson about leaving a pan on the stove--never again! So spend the few extra $$ and get one of these--they are so worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I have a number of Oxo Good Grips products. Every one of these is better than the normal or standard version available from other manufacturers: Some only marginally, some substantially, and some spectacularly. This stainless steamer basket is in the \"spectacularly better\" category. I have the newest version and the engineering is amazing; odd to say about a product that has been around for years. The tall foldable feet prevent boiling rather than steaming your food and allow you to fill the pot once and get several steaming sessions if you have multiple items to cook. Important if what you're steaming cooks at different rates.The handle assembly is amazing. It telescopes for easy storage and extends for easy handling going into or out of the pot. The \"fork slot\" is also a good idea. I've been burned handling a steamer basket before. The handle also unscrews for large items like fish. But even cooler, it tightens with a click-stop torque limiter so you don't screw the handle in too tight and then can't unscrew it when it's loaded. Brilliant! Lastly, the stemmed handle allows adroit handling of a loaded basket. When you have a basket that uses a ring style handle and it is heavier on one side it makes lowering into a steaming pot difficult AND dangerous. Great product. Absolutely worth the price and I would recommend it to everyone I know.",

                "reviewText": "There is a reason this steamer costs more than others, and it is well worth it.We eat a lot of steamed foods and this is the best steamer I've ever used. It is useful for veggies, chicken, fish etc. I've had MANY problems with blades coming loose from the cheaper brands, but this one is well built and more durable, so I have not experienced that issue. The legs can fold up, won't scratch non stick surfaces, and are long enough to give you plenty of water for prolonged cooking times. This is a welcome addition because many of the cheaper brands have short legs, forcing you to constantly monitor the water level else get that nasty burning smell when it runs dry. There is also a handle which pushes down for a low profile when cooking (so you can use a lid), and then raises to easily pull the steamer out when it's done.The only caveat, as with all stainless steel steamers, is that when cooking fish or chicken it will be a huge mess to clean up if you do not use a non-stick spray product beforehand. The meat gets stuck in the holes and between the blades and takes some effort to clean off by hand. This is dishwasher safe, but putting it into the dishwasher with a lot of food still stuck on it will only dry it up onto the steamer. Coat with PAM or brush with olive oil before steaming and you'll be fine.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice steamer basket! It is a little bigger than I expected and larger than my old one that it is replacing, as you can see in the picture I posted. The old one lasted me over 30 years, so I expect the new one to pretty much last the rest of my life. What I really like about it are the longer feet which allow me to put more water in the pot which puts my mind at ease that the pot will not boil dry if I walk away for a few minutes, and yes, that has happened in the past with the old one. The extendable centre handle is very nice and makes it very easy to remove when it is hot, it is also easy to remove if you need to use all the space, but as I usually only cook for myself or two people at most, I doubt I will need to remove it often.I have used it a few times since getting it, mostly for vegetables and to steam hotdogs, and have found it very easy to clean afterwards. I haven't noticed that the edges are any more dangerous than they were on my old one, and I cannot see anyone who is familiar with this type of steamer having any risk of cutting themselves as they should be used to handling them.Overall, it is a great steamer basket for the price. You could probably find a cheaper one, but I doubt you could find a better one. The extendable feet are the main thing that put it over the top for me, and I am very pleased with my purchase.",
