So, when we saw this on sale during the \"Prime Days\" we thought why not give it a try and we are so happy we did. This steam mop works so much better then to other one. The rotating mop heads scrub and steam very well even the grout now gets cleaned way more than we could have imagined. Top notch and solid quality construction, very durable and easy to use. We love the port for adding water, very smart design and easy to fill. It is actually very fun to use compared to the previous model. This mop simply glides across the floor and does a good job scrubbing.",

The only square head \"Shark\" steam mop worked very well for 3 years then just stopped steaming. So we went without for a while and we missed the sanitation and clean the steam mop does.So when we saw this on sale during the \"Prime Days\" we jumped and purchased. We are so happy we did. This thing works so well. We love how it cleans our floors. The rotating mop heads scrub and steam very well. We love that the cleaning pads are removable and easy to wash by just throwing them in the washer and dryer.Seems very durable and is easy to use. It is actually very fun to use. It glides across the floor and does a good job scrubbing. My floors have never been more sanitary.This will not replace a mop for spills and clean ups but it does a great job of sanitizing.",

                "reviewText": "I saw the cheaper version of this steam mop (without the Blaster extra steam feature) well reviewed on a consumer site, so I decided to get Shark's top-of-the-line, assuming it would be even better. It's a great steam mop. I've had three steam mops now, two without motorized heads, now one with motorized pads.This mop beats the others in three important ways:1) Much more steam. It produces double the steam of other mops, even at intermediate level. At blaster level, it rocks steam. And you can inject spray by a hand trigger in addition to the auto steam feed.2) The powered rotating heads are no gimmick. They work, and well. And the mop heads don't come off as easily as the rectangular mop heads on my previous steam mops.3) Finally, it may seem a small thing, but the six extra feet of cord this mop has versus my previous mop make all the difference in the world in convenience of use.I STRONGLY commend this mop to anyone considering it.",

Ended up returning that one and just putting our old one in the camper. We ordered this one to replace the one in our home and it\u2019s awesome! If you have dogs, get this. Love that it scrubs and steams at the same time!",

                "reviewText": "I have a dusty old home. Even living in the humid midwest I have to dust two-three times a week and then I add my 2 dogs and a cat to the mix and I\u2019ve got the perfect mix for constant dirty floors.The puppies track in mud, dirt, leaves and sticks, you name it. The cat leaves his fur and litter wherever he chooses. And the dust. Well. It dusts. Everything.I have a normal steam mop that I\u2019ve loved for so long but it can\u2019t handle the fine dust along with the other asks that I have of it. And I noticed it during a deep clean of the hardwood stairs (oh. yes. did I mention. hardwood everywhere!) that the very next day a fine layer of dust still existed. It was like my perfect steam mop hadn\u2019t made a dent.So on the hunt I went for something that would lift up dust and dirt and fur (I do vacuum 3-5x a week as well). I tried a cross wave but it got clogged in 10 seconds flat. And while it might be good for a one pet household or I need one of the bigger versions, it felt like more of a inconvenience for me.So back on the hunt I went.And then this Shark showed up and I couldn\u2019t stop lusting after it.And so one day in a crazed state (it was late at night, I couldn\u2019t sleep thinking about the dusty) I bought it.I waited with bated breathe and couldn\u2019t wait to use it!It\u2019s perfect. My floors will never be fully clean but this easily lifts up the dust and the dirt. I\u2019m glad I got the stepped up version with the steam stream or whatever it\u2019s called bc that really helps with the tile and the dirt that gets stuck to the floor but if you don\u2019t have all wood and tile or 3 four legged creatures who let your share their home OR your home isn\u2019t amazingly dusty, then likely you could get away with the basic version.I\u2019ve used this several times and love how easy it is to use, get started, fill up, attach the pads, and wash the pads. I have had very few issues with it (except the one time I flew too close to the sun and it tore my internet cord out of my wall, but that\u2019s fully my own fault, not fault of the mop)The one and only con I have is that I think it\u2019s so dumb the tank is not detachable. If Shark and Bissell had a baby steam mop, that would be the perfect steam mop. I have to use this steam mop until the tank is empty even if I\u2019m doing a small space bc I refuse to pick it up and dump the water back into the sink.This is one issue I always have with Shark. I looooove that they\u2019re such a dupe for Dyson, I just wish their design for convenience was a little better.That said, I\u2019m 1000% satisfied with my purchase and 12/10 recommend!",
