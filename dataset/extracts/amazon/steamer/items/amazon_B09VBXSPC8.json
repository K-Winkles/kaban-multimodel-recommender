                "reviewText": "It arrived on time, in a nice black carry case with all the supplies. It literally took me 2 minutes to set this thing up and i had steaming \"hot\" water shooting out of this thing in no time. It's crazy how hot the water gets when there's no tank reservoir in which I really love about this thing; the endless water supply and don't have to worry about how much water is left. Another thing I really like is that its very compact and easy to take on a trip, especially if your go camping and have a trailer. The hose length is perfect and the nozzle works amazing and has a user friendly trigger to adjust the pressure. The main reason I purchased this is for auto detailing the engine and interior, general use around the house (bathrooms, toilet) and works very well cleaning door/window tracks. I would \"highly\" recommend this product to anyone that loves to clean, and yes, it's worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "I tried this product ro clean my smoker, while it did a good job cleaning, I started ro get a lot of steam out of rhe main body, after a few minutes I noticed the floor where I had sat the machine was wet and when I picked it up, water started ro come out of the machine. Another problem was that when I released the steaming wand, steam kept coming out of it. I had ro squeeze the trigger several times before it shut off. I could not find a phone number ro call to ask about this product. Would nor recommend purchasing one.Seller contact me thru Amazon to replaced the steamer. They did sent me a new one without me having to return the original order. I tested it on my smoker and it did quick work of it with no issues. I was very impressed with it therefore I changed my rating of the product to 4 stars.",

I've tried using those steam cleaners that look like vacuum cleaners, but this one is a little nicer because when it runs out of water, I don't have to wait until it cools down, then refill it, then wait until it heats back up. I can just swap out the gallon jug of distilled water. On the flip side, I have to carry around a jug of distilled water, which could tip over if I'm careless. But maybe I'm just not good at steam cleaning ... it doesn't clean as effectively as I was hoping. It has worked fine on those things that just require a little of elbow grease, but it hasn't been effective against some kitchen areas that I haven't been able to clean with detergents and abrasives.",

You can adjust the setting knob to provide more steam/lower temp or less steam/higher temp, but even at the highest temp, I could still hold my hand -directly- in front of it. Accordingly, it did not, and could not, dissolve the grease from my range hood or oven, which is the purpose for which I bought it. It is a wonderful idea, and came nicely packaged with accessories and a carrying case, but it was just not fit for purpose. I would call it more of a mini pressure washer vs. a steamer. Since it didn't work as described, i.e., a steamer, I give it one star.",

                "reviewText": "*****UPDATE(2)*****Okay after finally getting some use out of it, I have used the wand with the brass bolt and the all-silver wand. I personally like the one with the brass bolt more. It is a little bit shorter than the all-silver one by about 1-2 inches. I use my steamer very regularly and I tend to go through gaskets every couple of car detail jobs (2-6 hours of extended use at a time). Unfortunately, the issue I ran into now is that the steamer(2) I had bought lost all suction power and would not suck water from the bucket I use. I really do like this steamer but I don't like how unreliable parts of it can be that I cannot fix myself. I have had a total of 3 of these steamers. Steamer(1) I used for about a year and a half with no issues till it wore out, steamer(2) that worked for about 2.5 months, and steamer(3) that this company sent to replace the wrong wand - See first update.*****UPDATE(1)*****Customer service reached out to me asking if they could send me a new extender with the brass screw instead of the silver one it came with. I told them I would be happy to accept it and update my review. They ended up sending me a whole new steamer which is fine but it has the exact same extender. I have not used it yet but I would not doubt I will have the same issue. If this is not updated in the future then it probably did.In the pictures, they show an extender with a brass bolt that attaches to the handle. The extender that came with my order had not a brass bolt. On each end of the extender were adapters screwed in to attach the brush and then to attach to the handle. The first time using it, the GLUE dissolved and steam started leaking out from the adapters.",
