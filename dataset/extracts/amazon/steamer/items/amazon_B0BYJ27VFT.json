I like that it can also work as a regular iron as well.",

The dual ironing styles make it versatile for all my ironing needs. Whether I need to steam my clothes while hanging or iron them flat, this mini iron does it all. The 180\u00b0 rotating handle is a great feature that allows for comfortable and easy use in any position. The one-click opening design makes refilling the water tank a breeze. In terms of performance, this mini iron heats up quickly and delivers fast and powerful steam output, making ironing efficient and effortless. The portable and convenient design, with a long power cord and included cloth bag, makes it easy to store and carry during travel. I highly recommend this mini steam iron for anyone in need of a compact and reliable ironing solution.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this mini iron is a beautiful piece of work. I have the white with copper trim. Even the electric cord is beautiful. It is wrapped in some sort of fabric material. I got it because the picture they show made it look like lots of steam is coming out and that it can be used as a steamer to steam your clothes and get rid of the wrinkle. Unfortunately, it did not do this for me. It does a great job at ironing and getting the wrinkles out but it did not just steam the wrinkles out without ironing. You plug it in and it is on. There is only one button and that is to turn the steam on. It will make some noises for a little bit before steam comes out. There\u2019s a base that you can put it on in between ironing. It\u2019s not designed to sit any other way. You will have to remember to unplug it once you\u2019re done because it will stay on. It also comes with a small cup to pour water in. You should always use distilled water with any iron otherwise it will be clogged with minerals and is pretty much impossible to clean out. It also comes with a nice traveling bag that you can put everything in. I don\u2019t think that I will use this to travel since I don\u2019t want to carry another thing with me but I will probably use this at home for small items. Also, most hotels have an iron.",
