We highly recommend using distilled water to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up caused by hard water (tap water). What is the full height of the steamer? The height of the steamer from the base to the top of the hanger with the pole fully extended is 65 inches. Is it necessary to drain the water and reservoir after each use? It's best practice to drain the excess water from the tank and reservoir to prolong the life of your steamer and to prevent mineral build-up. It also prevents water from spilling while in storage. I just got my steamer and the steam hose is really stiff. The hose is made with dual-insulated material to regulate temperature and once you start using your steamer, the hose will become softer. How do I troubleshoot leaking issues? Leaking usually happens when the water tank cap is not screwed properly to the water tank. This causes the tank to not sit on the steamer perfectly, causing water leak.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this garmet steamer for obvious reasons :) main reason being I swore off ironing after doing my service with the Marine Corps. No one truly understands how much ironing our branch actually did compared to others. Lol! At first I relied ok the dryer dewrinkle cycle but soon found out it doesn't work as well.While researching I found a variety of sizes and styles but I just wanted a hard core steamer for anything without being oversized etc..Basically what we all want. I did more research and read a million reviews when I decided on this one. I was able to put it together and read through the manual in about 5 minutes. I must admit I was skeptical because the top half can be a bit flimsy especially at certain heights and you may not want to put heavy or a large amount of clothing on the hanging rack due to this. I have put like 6 or 7 womens summer tops (attempting to figure out what wear) on there with no worriesI simply turn it on within minutes steam is rolling out letting you know she is ready! I've used it on multiple types of fabric without a slightest problem. It's takes minutes just minutes to complete a regular shirt! I usually as you can see in pics leave it standing up in my bedroom but always include it on road trips. It's easy to fold down and store or travel with. It's wonderful. I can't think of anything to really complain about.My son is 24 and has quite the collection of leather Nike shoes and myself with quite the variety of a collection as well. We figured out that when shoes are dirty we actually will steamer up close take it back steam up close etc... it actually will remove a lot of dirt etc...I just love it! I am definitely an Amazon fanatic but this is one of my all time top 10 purchases!",

I zip tied the lower hose to the telescoping pole and this seems to be solving that issue. Overall, very easy to use and it does get the wrinkles out!",

                "reviewText": "I just started a new job and I suit up everyday, 5 days a week. I\u2019m so over ironing and was gonna consider dry cleaning. I decided to try this first as I figured if it would work, it would be cheaper than a weekly dry cleaning bill. Whew hoo!!! So happy I made this choice. Quick and easy. The steam gets hot so watch your hands. Place to hang my clothes while I steam them. I love it and it takes only a few minutes to get my clothes ready for looking good the next day. This is also a back saver for anyone like myself who can\u2019t stand and iron clothes for long due to back pain. I love the pole which can extend to accommodate a dress or other long garment. Great buy for me personally and well worth the cost.",

I believe the reviews are positive because this is the cheapest garment steamer out there. Once assembled, the hose cannot be put away the way it's shown in the picture. The steam is inconsistent, at times there was steam others there wasn't making a funny noise as well. The handle gets hot! How am I supposed to steam my clothes if I can't hold the handle? Got hot after 10 minutes. The wheels are a joke, they don't work at all. All in all, it works (for now) it feels cheap, hose is not long enough it feels like a kids toy because the hose is so short! Wheels don't work so have to lift it and the steam is inconsistent.",
