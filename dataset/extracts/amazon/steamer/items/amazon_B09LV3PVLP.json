                "reviewText": "Of course the steam can get really hot when using the steamer. This glove at the very least protects your hand and allows you to back up the material as you apply steam. If you can get to the area you are steaming and apply a little pressure on the opposite side with the glove it helps to \"iron\" out the wrinkles. It is a little bulky, the front is tapered which helps getting into some areas. However, it is 1 1/4 inch thick and the front while tapered does not come to much of a point. So there are some areas that you may not be able to reach. The back where you insert your hand under the mesh also has a loop for you finger to help stabilize it on your hand. So it is a good aid for your steaming that will aid you in most but not all areas because of it's shape and bulk. Overall a good product with only a few limitations at a great price.",
