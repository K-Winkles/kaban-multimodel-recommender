                "reviewText": "This is the first steamer I've ever owned. It works fairly decent for shirts/blouses (that's what I bought it for primarily), not sure how it would work on heavier and larger items. It does take a while to get the wrinkles & creases out and you have to hold up right next to the fabric. Maybe this is how they all work. Overall, it works for what I currently need it for, however, I may buy a larger more powerful one in the future.",

I didn't think much of it and scrubbed it with a toothbrush, but a white stain remained. I poured water inside like usual and suddenly I heard a weird noise and water started leaking from the bottom and it truly sounded like it was going to explode. I immediately disconnected the steamer from the outlet and came to Amazon to request a refund. Turns out that the return window closed and now I can no longer use this product. Would not recommend.",
