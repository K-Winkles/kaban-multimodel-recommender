My wife used this steam cleaner in the kitchen to clean the stove. It took a minute to restore the stove and the most important it gets dry very quick. Few small details like clean the restroom mirror in less than a minute and so on. I really appreciate if the manufacture extend the cord to be longer. Overall, very good product and recommended.",
