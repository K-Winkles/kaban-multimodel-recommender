                "reviewText": "This has been a time saver when it comes to getting my husband ready for work in the morning! His company work shirts, and occasional flannels can be extremely difficult to iron or fluff out the constant wrinkles. With this steamer, it works like magic on them! I love that it is easy to fold up for storage. The tank is large enough to do a few items at a time before refilling. It has an iron plate, so smoothing out his collars, and pocket flaps are easy to press out in a jiffy! Most steamers you can only use upright, but this one has the handy capability to use while clothes are laying on a table or ironing board. It also comes with a safety mitt so you aren\u2019t risking burning yourself! My husband feels more confident at work knowing he isn\u2019t looking like a wrinkled mess when going to work, and I don\u2019t have to work on one shirt for an hour for the most minimal results. I now can have them looking pressed and spiffy within 5 minutes! I highly recommend this steamer for anyone having problems with tough wrinkles. It\u2019s also a perfect travel companion vs taking a bulky iron! I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this product!",

Heats up very quickly and produces a lot of steam. Can use it upright or face down. The steamer face works like a little iron around buttons. It does fold down for travel and is a good size. Not tiny, but I have learned if I need a steamer on a trip, it is worth packing something that works even if little larger.",

This has been performing perfectly and it's very easy to use. It heats up very quickly and so far it does not \"spit\" or drip.",

I read so many reviews for so many different products, this seemed to be an issue for all of them, so I wasn\u2019t too bothered when it started.I do not recommend using the glove it came with. Mine was falling apart and what looked like snow came out from it, decided to try it anyways and burned my hand :( definitely get something more durable if you plan on using a glove.",

HOWEVER, now every time we use it, our clothes would just get really wet from it and won't even be ironed properly. Not sure if we just got a defective one but this is really disappointing. It's the same issue even if we use it vertically or horizontally or even with less water in the reservoir. Would not recommend this.",
