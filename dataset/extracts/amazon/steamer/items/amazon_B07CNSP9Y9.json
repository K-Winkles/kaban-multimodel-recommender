I did a lot of online research for a replacement and discovered to my dismay that standards had slipped with a lot of the brands that were trusted in the past. I have a couple of other Conair items, and they've worked well for me, so I thought I'd try the Conair iron. I am loving it! It produces a lot of steam, it doesn't spit or leak. It's heavy, but I like that, as it means I don't have to press as hard. I like the titanium plate, as it doesn't pit or degrade as other surfaces do. I am very pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "About a decade ago the iron I had had for about a decade finally died. I then went on a horrible journey of buying one iron after another that died within a year or so, sometimes within months. And I am talking about top-of-the-line name brands. They leaked, scorched and the sole plates would be a mess in no time.But this ConAir is really a champ. After 17 months, the sole plate is pristine and it has ironed smoothly and well, but it died suddenly. I replaced it with a less expensive and simpler iron that had a horrible soleplate that gunked up after using it only a few weeks. I am returning it. And, reluctantly, am ordering this Conair model again because no iron seems to last two years any longer, and this is a consumer issue that must be addressed. It appears that manufacturers are making irons (and other products) that do not last so we consumers must purchase them more often than our parents and grandparents did.",
