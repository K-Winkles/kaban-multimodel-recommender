                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My other, expensive steam cleaner died on me so I looked around online to find a replacement and came across this one. Just wanted something kind of inexpensive this time but still had decent reviews. Didn't expect it to be this high quality though for the price!First: I love the locking mechanism on the button. My old steamer had this button that was WAY too easy to press and I hit it accidentally on several occasions (in one instance, even burning my inner forearm). This one locks so you don't accidentally press it.Also loving some of these attachments like the squeegee attachment. Amazing for cleaning stuff like a dirty bath tub... I work on cars and motorcycles a lot so I get pretty dirty... which equals my shower/bath tub getting pretty dirty. I gotta scrub clean it like once or twice a week to keep it somewhat clean but as you can see in the video, it still gets this... what I assume is grease and filth from the car parts everywhere. Near impossible to get off with a scrub brush but this steam cleaner with the squeegee attachment does the trick in seconds. Couldn't be happier with that. My old steam cleaner couldn't even do that.Also, this thing heats up SO MUCH FASTER and puts out more steam than my old one did. Makes cleaning car interiors (like the plastic siding), shoes, bathtubs, tile floors, etc. SO MUCH faster than before. I'm using this thing on everything I own now with all these attachments, haha.Anyway, I felt like I needed to actually take the time to review this one since I was just so impressed with how much better it is than my old one - even though it's like half the price. Now I feel like I got scammed by my old steam cleaner, heh. Hope this info and video is helpful for someone out there. Don't normally do video reviews unless it's something I'm really impressed with :)",

As for the Bissell. It's heavier with no safety switch. Steam comes out better. I need to stick to the best sellers. I'm sorry but this one isn't for me because of it breaking down. As for the Bissell, it's the mint green one.",

                "reviewText": "I originally ordered the steam cleaner for a family member, but ended up keeping it for myself since she purchased one. I finally had a use for it after it had been sitting on a shelf in my laundry room for a year.I read the instructions for proper operation before doing anything with the unit. I do love the various attachments that come with the steam cleaner. I noticed when I opened the cleaner to pour in the water, there were what appeared to be hard water spots around the top and the metal part of the lid that screws in is rusty and there looks to be some chunks of clear plastic around the metal on the lid. I didn\u2019t order a used/refurbished unit but it appeared that is what I was sent and the seller didn\u2019t bother to clean it up upon receiving it before shipping it to me.I filled the unit with the recommended amount of water, making sure not to add more than recommended. I screwed on the lid and plugged it in. After a few minutes, the unit started making sound and I heard a pop (assuming that was the lid popping up). Immediately, steam and hot water started spraying out from under the lid and hot water started dripping down the side of the unit. I\u2019m thankful I didn\u2019t get burned. Immediately I unplugged it and let it cool. I re read the manual and after several hours, I unscrewed the lid and poured the water out. Along with the water, sand came out of the unit as did flakes of a white substance. I poured cold water in and dumped it out to give the unit a good rinse.I decided to give it a second try and poured water in, only using 175 ml. I screwed the lid on and plugged in the unit. The orange light came on when I plugged it in. It has been about 15 minutes now and I pulled the trigger to use it and nothing is happening. No steam, no water, nothing. It\u2019s not even making sounds.I am disappointed that I received such a poor quality steam cleaner. If it worked, it would be such a handy tool to use around and house and it\u2019s easy to move due to the compact size. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s worth the money or the risk of injury.",

I used this in an old shower that wasnt getting clean any other way (1980s weird PVC/Plastic pan and etched, with a person who loves charcol soap sooooo.) I was desperately trying to find something to replace my shark lift away that gave up the ghost. Came across this as a quick find, and wow. The steam DOES get hot. I like the ease of attachments, especially the fabric steamer tool, in the shower it worked awesome on the walls. Tried the window tool, not great. Steam, grab my old microfiber cloth (its a hardy beast), wipe. It actually got all the gunk off the walls, the rim of the pan and just outside. (Will not embarrass myself with pictures). Not too shabby of a steamer at all. Still trying to attack the pan and the BIG NASTY, but the ring around it is CLEAN for the first time, and Ive literally tried all the new stuff and old wives tricks. Im not gross, its just a bad shower, PERIOD.",
