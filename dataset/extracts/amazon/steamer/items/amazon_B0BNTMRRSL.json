                "reviewText": "I had been wanting a clothes steamer. I am one of those people who don\u2019t fold their clothes immediately when they come out of the dryer and I practically live out of my laundry baskets. Ironing my clothes is a joke to me, honestly. But my (regular, mostly cotton) shirts would get wrinkled sitting in the basket and who wants to look disheveled or unprofessional? This was an impulse buy at first, due to the price on Prime Day. The reviews didn't seem too bad, so I thought I would try it. It comes with instructions, but is pretty self explanatory. I saw one review about it getting \"stuck\" and not folding back down before I bought it. When I got it, there's clearly a button to hold to collapse it for travel, so that seamed (see what I did there? Lol) like user error by that rater. The button moves freely for me, so no concern about folding it down and packing it. I fill it up the tank easily in the sink to the fill line with cold water and it takes \u201cmaybe\u201d 30-45 seconds to heat up - it\u2019s quick. This steamer does not have an off or on switch, so it starts heating up as soon as it\u2019s plugged in, so it should always be unplugged when not in use and to cool it down before packing it away. It gets hot pretty quick and starts making \u201csteaming noises\u201d when it\u2019s ready, you would know. It does have a button that you hold down when actively using it on your clothes. I did find that if you go to use it immediately, it \u201cspits\u201d out drops of water before it becomes an even stream. I saw a few complaints about that after buying it, but I just give it a few test squeezes into the air to get some of the \"spittle\" out. After that, it is an even stream of steam and works exactly as expected. The reservoir is small, so it\u2019s not for a whole wardrobe (obviously), but perfect for a shirt or two. The cord is pretty short, so do take that into consideration if it matters to you. I just plug it into the outlet by my bathroom door, hang my shirt up on the door via a clothes hanger, and steam them. So far no burning of clothes or any issues. I have not traveled yet with it, but it is small enough to take (kind of the size of the hair dryers you find in hotels). I\u2019ve used it about 6 times now already, no issues, or complaints!Extra: I planned to take this on a cruise vacation, but found out Carnival Cruise Lines do not allow personal clothes steamers, so, while I did not know that before buying it, that is not their fault, nor do I regret the buy. It still works at home or other travel!!",
