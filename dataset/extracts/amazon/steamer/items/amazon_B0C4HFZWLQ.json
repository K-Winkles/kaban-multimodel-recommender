It has a thoughtful design in that the handle swings out of the way so you can fill the water chamber easily.The plate that comes in contact with the clothes is SLICK -- so no sticking and slides easily without bunching.I love the power indicator that shows what power level is associated with each type of fabric. It also heats up very quickly which is great if you just want to do a quick touch up.I tend to not iron as much as I should because it is a hassle dealing with my full-sized iron etc. But with this, it really doesn't slow you down and your clothes look presentable in very short order! Really love it for small quick jobs when you are in a hurry. And I also like the grey -- nice color change from plain old white![LCVR]",

Also it is very light so you don\u2019t have to worry about it adding pounds to your luggage doing travel.

                "reviewText": "I really appreciated the concept of this steam iron. It indeed does produce a good amount of steam and irons out wrinkles very well. I tried it without starch and it did the job with ease. Two issues I had was that you only get about 5 minutes ironing time before you have to refill with water, which won't be a bother if you're ironing one piece of clothing. Also, every time I refilled the water, it spilled over because there's no real way to know how much water is enough until it's spilling out. I tried to pour super slow and stare at the hole to see the level rise but still wasn't able to catch it before it spilled over. There's a small window on the outside of the iron but I don't know what it's for because it doesn't show you the water level. Also of note, the iron makes a loud clicking sound when it's time to fill it back up with water which could be avoided if the window showed how much water was left, giving an indication of when to refill it.",

This one comes with a little pouch and is so much more attractive without sacrificing functionality too much. It works well on the few occasions I need it to.I'd recommend this to others looking for something a little smaller or more portable!",
