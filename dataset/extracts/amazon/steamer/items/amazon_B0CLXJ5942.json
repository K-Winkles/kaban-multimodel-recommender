                "reviewText": "I got this pack of Jirmory steam mop replacement pockets for my Shark S3501 steam mop. This model is listed in the description so I got them knowing they were made specifically for the model I had. They arrived and are good, heavy pads with a nice mop texture material that feels like it will clean well. The inside has the similar mesh construction my original pads have, so from a quality standpoint, they seem to be built similar and are comparable quality to the originals.The only problem with these is when I put them on they are VERY tight. All the pads I have I can pull on from one side and almost one-handed pull them into place. They come off just as easily. These pads are so tight that I have to put each side on at the bottom, and then gently slide them a little bit at a time up into place. I popped a seam on the first one trying to pull it on, but was able to get the second one on without damage. Once on, they work just fine and the hook and loop connects around the back. They clean just fine and then are a bit difficult to remove again.Outside of the fit issue, they are perfect and the value is very good for six of them. I will continue to use them and hope they will loosen up with continued use. I think if they were just a half an inch wider they would be perfect. If you are willing to wrestle with these a little, then I do think they are worth it, but if you want something that goes on and off easy then these would not be the right choice.",

                "reviewText": "I love finally having extra mop heads so I don't have to keep using the same dirty ones or at least look dirty from many uses even after washing. These are a little tight going on because they have elastic in the corners to hold them on better. I really had no trouble getting them on though. They have the same velcro closing on them that the original pads had to hold them on. They are a little bigger than my previous ones so bunch at the top a little on my Lift-Away Pro, but there is no issue at all when using them. These pads work very well and the terry fabric helps get the dirt from all the grout in the floor.",

                "reviewText": "So, through no fault of the seller, I did not pay close attention to the models of Shark Steam mops this fit, so was sad to find out the hard way that it did not fit my steam mop. However, I used it to spot treat deep stains on my hardwood floors in my kitchen, and it worked a treat! It seems to have more abrasiveness to it than my typical covers (but not so much that it would scratch the floors). I also found out, that in a pinch, I could get these covers to fit over my original Swiffer mop, which worked out fantastically for me. The best part of these covers is that they are dual sided, so if your floors are especially dirty (or if you are neurotic like me and just want to ensure a clean floor), you can rotate them half way through cleaning.",
