My friend (bride) and I (bridesmaid) brought our steamers for her dress, for the getting-ready time. Her steamer was one of those really bougie-looking rose gold steamers. Unfortunately, her cord was really short and it hardly made a difference in steaming her veil. I mean, it was barely letting out any steam at all. It would've taken hours to steam the veil and even then, I'm not sure how well that would've worked. I gave up on her steamer and started using mine. Wow, this steamer did the job and did it quickly. The cord was also double the length of hers. I wouldn't consider it extremely long, but those couple of feet made a huge difference! And any part of her dress or veil that got wet from the steamer dried up in minutes. It wasn't even a concern",
