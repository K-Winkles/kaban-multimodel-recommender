                "reviewText": "The first time I used this it worked great. I thought it was going to me a great product. A few days later I turned it on to use it a second time and it started spitting out water everywhere. The water gets boiling hot in the inside, so when the water came flying out it splashed onto my leg and foot and burned me. I thought maybe I did something so I tried it for a third time and left it sitting upright on the counter and the same thing happened- water was spitting everywhere. Terrible product, do not recommend!",
