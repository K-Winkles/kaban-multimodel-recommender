Seriously, I'm head over heels for this thing!You know that heartbreak when you carefully hand wash and hang dry that adorable blouse or dress made of synthetic material, only to discover it looks like it's been through a rough time with a geriatric elephant? Yeah, been there. And don't even get me started on the whole ironing ordeal \u2013 either the fabric melts, or you're dealing with shirring that requires the skills of a professional laundress.Enter this steamer \u2013 a total game-changer. It tackles all the issues I used to dread. Now, I'll admit, it demands a bit of patience (and patience isn't my strong suit), but the results? Absolutely worth it, 100%.Let me add my own twist to this. The water tank in this thing is beyond imagination \u2013 seriously massive. I can steam away for ages without worrying about running out. And the extras? A brush that zaps away those pesky fabric pills, a measuring cup making refills a breeze, and a heat-resistant glove to keep me burn-free. Trust me, these accessories are worth every penny.Please don't sit on the fence like I did for soooo long. It's worth every penny.",

These definitely filter out a lot of noise, but it was still loud enough to hear others talking even in a loud setting. I can\u2019t wait to use these in the future!!",
