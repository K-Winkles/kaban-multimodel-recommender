My husband wears button-up shirts for his office job, and they\u2019re often wrinkled when freed from the laundry cycle. I read in other reviews on this product that it could be used to steam wrinkles out of shirts that were still hanging.What? You can steam wrinkles out of shirts while they are hanging? You can skip the ironing board!?I loathe the ironing board, so you can imagine what that bit of knowledge did to my brain. A choir of angels rejoiced. The world suddenly seemed brighter, and my shoulders felt lighter.Anyway, I ordered this little hand held steamer a quick moment later, eagerly anticipated its arrival, and tested it out today. It works! I\u2019m not going to claim that steaming the shirts while they hung was as crisp an outcome as ironing them on an ironing board, but the improvement is substantial, and given my antipathy towards the ironing board, my husband can deal with the imperfections while he\u2019s relying on me to do the work.I did run out of literal steam quickly with the hand held steamer, unfortunately, and I do not look forward to refilling it frequently when going through shirts, but this is still a delightful improvement over our previous situation.",

                "reviewText": "I was wondering what to expect since this product is labeled as multi-functional. It has a nice carrying/storage bag and water/measuring cup. There is also a holding/hot plate to rest on. Although it's a bit heavier than I expected, it's still easy to use.I read the instructions FIRST, and I recommend you do too. They provide detailed information throughout, but they are pretty straightforward.Here's my experience with it:The dry function, as an iron, was relatively cool, requiring more effort to use on something like cotton. This function is not the best quality.For the steam function, my unit did best in the flat position. It definitely had more steam power in that position, and the unit is not any noisier than any other steam iron. When I was done using it, I put it on the rest plate and moved the knob to the dry position. I never had any issues with it leaking. I did test it on an old towel first, as the instructions indicated, but I didn't have any problems with leaking or other issues.The instructions did not mention that when using it as a steamer in the upright position, it works best and has the highest output of steam when the nose of the unit is pointing up. In other words, the unit length is perpendicular to the floor. I did not get much, if any, steam out of it if I had the unit parallel to the floor. This unit is best used as a steamer rather than an iron, and even with that, it is fair to good at best.I have learned that having a backup iron is good if the primary one stops working. I will keep this for that reason, but I would not buy it for that purpose. This would do if I need a steamer in a pinch, but purchasing an actual steamer may be the best option if that's what you're looking for.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This mini iron comes with a drawstring carrying bag, a plastic pour cup for water, and a heat safe plate to rest it on. I don\u2019t do very much ironing and didn\u2019t want to commit to a full size iron and ironing board as I live in a small apartment. I mainly use my dryer to get rid of wrinkles but I wanted something for the more stubborn wrinkle prone clothing items and for flattening cotton paper for artwork. This mini iron is the perfect solution. Everything fits in the draw string bag and takes up little room, it heats up quickly and works well. I had a small issue with it dripping water when on the steam mode, but I\u2019ve had that experience with other irons as well. The water capacity is very small, so it would be difficult to use this on multiple items on the steam mode without having to refill it. However, for someone who intends to use it rarely and for small jobs, it\u2019s a good alternative to a full size ironing set up.",

Filling the water reservoir is simple, it heats up quickly, and produces enough steam to remove wrinkles. However, the dry function is not very effective, especially on cotton, and requires more effort. The steam function works best when the iron is flat, producing more steam power. It can be placed on the rest plate without any leaks. Overall, it is better suited for steaming than ironing, but its performance is only average to good. Consider purchasing an actual steamer if you want a dedicated steamer.",
