                "reviewText": "These are a pretty good generic dupe to replace the original brand mop pads. The 1 feature that's actually better than the original is how well it sticks to the steam mop. The original pads only have little velcro-like spots that you have to perfectly line up with the spots on the mop head, but they never line up perfectly so the pad isn't secured very well. The nice thing about this product is the entire surface of the pad is that velcro-like material, so it'll stick to the mop head no matter where you place it. The only negative thing about these is that they get curled up in the wash, but since the whole surface is velcro it doesn't really matter because you just uncurl the edges as you place it on the mop and it sticks.",
