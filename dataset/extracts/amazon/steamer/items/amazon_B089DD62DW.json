                "reviewText": "I bought this steamer to get package wrinkles out of velvet curtains. It worked perfectly. It's compact, easy to use, (and came with directions and a storage bag). It was strong enough to get the wrinkles out - you have to go over it slowly a time or two - but the wrinkles did come out. It is meant to be small for travel so the water reservoir was really small. In spite of that I was able to steam one 108\" long by 54\" wide curtain panel with one full reservoir. If you need a very large reservoir to avoid refilling so often, a portable steamer is not for you. There was no spattering or leaking of water. Also, the reservoir is attached by a magnet - which I had never seen before but was super helpful. This portable steamer performed as advertised and I recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Recently purchased this steamer for a series of weddings I had to travel for and it has been a welcome addition to my travel essentials, and its lightweight design truly stands out. The compact size made it a breeze to carry around, fitting seamlessly into my luggage without adding unnecessary weight.The convenience of this product is undeniable\u2014it's easy to travel with, and the overall construction is durable enough to withstand the rigors of frequent use. The zipper worked smoothly, and the material held up well during my journeys.One aspect to consider is that, like many travel-friendly items, getting the wrinkles out of clothes packed in this bag required a bit of effort. While it wasn't a deal-breaker for me, it's worth noting that a quick touch-up with a steamer or some extra care during packing may be necessary to maintain a polished look.In summary, this steamer is a solid choice for those on the go who prioritize lightweight and portable solutions. Just be prepared to put in a little extra effort when it comes to wrinkle management. I'm giving it four stars for its overall convenience and travel-friendly design!",

                "reviewText": "Bought for $39.99 in Dec of 2023. It works very well for it's size. It's made so you can use it with things hanging as well as things laying horizontally. So you can lay things out on an ironing board or bed and steam them. The face does get quite hot, so place a hand towel on top of the item if you want to use the steamer like an iron. The water tank is small to keep the steamer travel size, so does run out pretty quickly. For travel and/or light use, this steamer is great. Time will if it's built for a decently long lifespan.",

                "reviewText": "I recently traveled by plane to a conference where I had to meet some important people and also give a stand-up presentation. The weather was cold and I packed some nice wool sweaters and chinos. My suitcase was stuffed and of course everything got very wrinkled. I bought this steamer and tried it out before the trip. It is compact and fits easily into the extra zipper space in my carry-on bag. It heats up immediately and makes lots of steam, and I could steam my entire outfit before the water chamber needed a refill. It probably takes longer than ironing, and probably doesn't work quite as well, but it get the job done and is WAY easier than setting up an iron. This steamer can be placed directly onto fabric for very stubborn areas, including wool, or it can be used 1-2 cm from fabric for a quick wrinkle release. I hang the garment from the shower curtain bar steam before I go to bed and it doesn't take long. I looked great in my outfits and I'll be packing this item on all my trips. I have even used it on wool blazers that got crushed from being packed in a suitcase. It takes the dents out of the shoulders and gets the wrinkles out of the back. It even worked on a windbreaker that I had stuffed into a travel pouch (very wrinkled!) The cord is not very long, but it was long enough to reach the garment in an apartment-sized bathroom. The quality is good and it seems like it will last a long time if it care is taken when using and storing it.",

I had 3 pairs of pants that arrived smashed in those small plastic bags. The shipping wrinkles were still visible even after washing them and air drying. This little machine (with some work) removed the wrinkles pretty much. The water tank is small so I needed to fill it for each pair of pants. I found the cord to be cumbersome. It\u2019s thick and tweaked so the unit was tipping over when I sat it down. Can\u2019t have it tipping over because the metal steam plate is hot. I did finally manage move the cord around to avoid it tipping over. I first tried it with the garment on a hanger through a cupboard handle like some of the videos showed. I found it easier to work the unit with the hanger on my shower rod. I don\u2019t plan to travel with it\u2026kinda bulky and heavy. All in all I could have gotten the same results by holding my Rowenta iron towards the garment and blasting it with steam.",

On the road, I've tried travel irons but they're a heavy bother, and hotel irons are just barely serviceable. This steamer is small enough to go into a side pocket of my suitcase and works well enough. It's not hugely powerful but it saves some time over ironing, and clothes can stay on the hanger while you steam them. It does sputter a little; not enough for it to be problematic as long as it gets the job done, which it does.",
