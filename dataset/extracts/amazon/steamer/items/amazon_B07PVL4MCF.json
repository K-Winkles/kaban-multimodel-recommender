It\u2019s very portable and easy to use. The only con is you have to be holding down the button for it to work you cannot just click it on. So when steaming my thumb starts to get sore from pressing it down. But other than that it works very well. I love the different attachments for different uses.",

The kid has broken multiple times on this one I had to hammer the lid to get it off a few times. I had let it cool off and tried to open it to refill it and the top flew off half way through and steam shot out and burnt the side of my arm. I'm not sure what's different about this one over the old one I had but it seems very much not safe.",
