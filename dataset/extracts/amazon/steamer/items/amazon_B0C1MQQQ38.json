                "reviewText": "I really would have kept this one if it had a trigger sprayer. I was going to order one if they had it. It heats up super fast. Works amazingly. The only downside was that since it is on continuous spray, you can\u2019t move from one area to another without having to turn it off at the power button and wait for the spayer to stop. I really would have kept it. It\u2019s cute, and practical. It has a long power cord and a long spayer cord.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used a few steamers so from my experience with them I\u2019ll say this was not my favorite. I do like that you can see how much water is in the tank. I couldn\u2019t with my previous steamers which is one of the main reasons I chose to buy this one. I used it on my shower/tub. The steam was good and strong and got it clean, but a few complaints. First thing I didn\u2019t like is the part you hold isn\u2019t at an angle which makes cleaning things awkward. There\u2019s a dial to control the amount of steam but I didn\u2019t notice any difference between the lowest and highest settings. The thing most concerning is what you see in my picture. The outer tube covering the inner tube is not attached on either end. This makes me greatly question how long this will last. I plan to return and try another model.",
