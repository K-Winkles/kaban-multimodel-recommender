                "reviewText": "In the last 6 months I have really invested time in comparing glassware. Performing taste test with my favorite champagnes, whether Brut and vintages alike. I noticed a huge difference in flavor and taste when comparing thinner to thicker glassware. If the lip of the glass is too thick, or if the glass is too thick, you truly miss the taste and the flavors a beautiful champagne can possess. The gorgeous Italian handblown, thin and super clear glass is the not only GORGEOUS, tall and elegant, but you capture all the flavors of any champagne, especially your high end champagne. The glass is so thin, nothing will come between you and your champagne! As thin as it is, it feel durable too. The base of the glass is very sturdy. This glassware is great for hosting parties, wedding venues or just a romantic sip of champagne at home. I purchased 20 glasses and have shared this brand with all my friends. The price point for the flute is a steal! You will not find this quality of handblown glassware for the price point sold today. Similar quality of super clear champagne glasses, with other brands, are much higher in price and do not compare to the beautiful Italian Handblown flute. Purchase a pair, and you will see you will come back for more!\u2665\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have always wanted a handheld steamer for as long as I can remember. Previously I had to deal with steamers that were either being too heavy, too small, or scorched my clothing. Into the donation pile they went.As I unpacked the AOOE Handheld Steamer, I was very happy because it looked so cool. But looks aren\u2019t what makes a great steamer. The steamer definitely feels sturdy, the weight is well balanced, and once I read the instructions (very helpful), my steamer was ready to work. I turned the steamer on and it was ready in 15 seconds. I selected the appropriate steam distribution (high or low), and I was set to go. So easy to use. I am completely satisfied!I definitely am able to bring my steamer with me when I travel, but it is just a little bit on the large size for short trips. It sure beats the heck out of ironing any day.Since we live in an arid climate, we have hard water, so it is important to use distilled water for the longevity of the steamer.",
