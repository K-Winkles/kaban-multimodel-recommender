                "reviewText": "The cord of this steamer is 70\" long. Almost 6 feet, which seems fine. But as most electrical outlets are near the floor, and you steam things when they are hanging up- that means you have to be standing right next to the outlet to use it. I literally couldn't reach the shirt I wanted to steam, because the shirt was hanging 4 feet away from the wall. So I took it into the bathroom, because the outlets are higher- I couldn't find anywhere close enough to the outlets to hang my shirt there either. So I decided to use my special extension cord that is for irons to test this- but I couldn't use the extension cord, because this steamer has a 3 prong plug and extension cords for irons only have two prong holes. Besides, this is for travel. Who wants to pack an extension cord? I decided to just cheat and sit on the floor and hold the clothes as best as I could to test it. I tried it on a pair of medium weight pants and I tried it on a light weight button down shirt. I was less than impressed. I had to go over the same areas over and over again to get wrinkles out. This machine is worthless to me.",

It\u2019s not overly heavy and burdensome to carry or hold but it\u2019s not cheaply made and lightweight were you feel like it\u2019s cheaply made. It works great at getting wrinkles out of everything\u2026yes I was so excited about this I steamed wrinkles out of everything I could find from curtains, dress shirts, dresses, sheets, brand new shower curtain with those \u201cI\u2019m brand Nee\u201d lines, and so much more. Works like a champs and so easy to use.",
