                "reviewText": "This steamer works really well to remove the wrinkles in clothes, it's just very different than ironing so you have to use it a few times to figure out how to make it work the best. You need to let it warm up for a minute or two before using it and it's best to steam the clothes while they are hanging vertically, but once you've used it a few times and worked out your process, it's great. It's pretty easy to damage your clothes while ironing, or have the iron leave marks on the fabric, using the steamer reduces those risks.The included lint brush is a nice accessory to remove lint and dog hair from clothes while you are steaming them. The steam seems to loosen it a bit and make it easier to remove. The laundry bag is decent quality, I won't use it day to day, but will toss it in my suitcase to use while traveling.I recommend this steamer and will definitely use it in place of my iron on items that the iron might damage. Plus I feel like steaming the clothes helps sanitize clothes a bit and gets out any odors from pets.",

                "reviewText": "Great little steamer. Just wish the steam lasted longer before you have to refill it. I was steaming silk pillowcases and it would only do one. Two would be preferable. But it does the job well, is easy to hold and use. Took the wrinkles out of my silk pillowcases nicely and safely. One other thing I wish it came with was a carrying bag for travel. It does come with a laundry bag, but a travel bag for the steamer itself would be better I think.",

                "reviewText": "I got this item to steam the curtains in my inlaws house. It works great; does the job and is a lot faster than ironing them. I was worried it would be too small to be efficient, but instead it's a very comfortable size to hold and use while not making the job seem cumbersome. The included laundry bag is a great bonus; you never have too many of these to carry laundry from the 2nd floor down to the basement and vice versa.",

                "reviewText": "If this is the first time you've used a travel-sized garment steamer, then this one will probably be OK in your opinion. However, while it barely works, it's not without frustration. True, I'm comparing it to the previous steamer I had, which stopped working recently. This steamer takes much longer to heat up, was much less obvious when it was ready, and overall made a fairly quick task take much longer than needed.My previous travel steamer was a $20 Black and Decker brand. It heated up much faster than this one...like by several minutes. When it was ready, you could see steam billowing out. Not so with this one...it was barely noticeable, which left me wondering whether or not it was actually ready and powerful enough to do the job. Steaming a garment probably take me a good 50%-100% MORE time with this one, than my previous travel steamer. You're probably better off with different, more powerful steamer. Or an iron.To its credit though, it is travel-sized and able to be easily transported with you. That's probably the best thing about it honestly.",

The first and only time I used the travel steamer it spluttered hot water everywhere because inside of the chamber the water was boiling. Very dangerous and after checking, faulty! There should be an intermediary step where you can discuss a genuine concern for a faulty item. Is there one that I am not aware of? What about warranty?",
