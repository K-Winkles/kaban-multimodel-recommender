I want this to be like the tik tok videos where a once over takes all the wrinkles out but I actually have to run this through the piece a couple of times. The lack of backing on the piece that you would get from an ironing board really makes the task harder to complete. Does it do the job? Yes. Does it replace an ironing board? No.",

It heating up super quickly (take about 15-20 seconds) and done the job perfectly when iron flat clothes. There's no leakage of water while the steamer setting on (I like it!). The setup is super easy (like a no brainer)...simply fill the water up to the maxi water level line and plug in, wait the flashing light becomes stable then it is good to use. The only small issue I was facing when ironing my cloth is the small tiny water tank, it doesn't hold much water. Therefore, I need to consistently fill waters in during the Iron time for steamers to consistently working. (the water could only last for 1 shirt / dress).overall, I enjoy the connivence, small in size, nice quality and done the job perfectly (up to my expectation). I do recommend this Steamer Iron if you have limited storage space or need to carry for travel. :)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. A few years ago I got my spouse a garment steamer and it decided to stop working a few months back. She hasn't asked for another one, but every now and then I do hear her quietly saying she wished she had another one. So when I saw this garment steamer I had to give it a try.First it's a very simple device. So simple in fact there is no on/off switch. When plugged in it is on. The only button on it is to turn on/off the steam pump. As well, there is no temperature adjustment. So due to that, in the instructions it says to avoid contact with garments requiring a low heat setting, or use a buffer in between.As there is no temperature control I had to pull out my IR temperature gun and see what it is doing. Here is what I found....With the steam turned off, it heats up initially to 352.8\u00b0C, then it drops. It drops all the way down to 266.0\u00b0C where it turned on the heating element and it went up to 310.3\u00b0C, and then started dropping again. It doesn't seem to be able to keep a consistent heat. And when steaming it heats up to 372.2\u00b0C. Quite a fluctuation in temperature!Aside from the fluctuating temperature, it does heat up really quick. When I first timed it I made the mistake of walking away and when I came back at 35 seconds it was already done heating up. I got it right on my second attempt. 21 seconds. That's all it took to heat up to full temperature from room temperature. That surprised me.Included is a water filling cup with a nice pour spout. It has 2 levels marked on it. The top reads 75ml. The bottom reads 55. I'm assuming the 55 is 55ml. When I filled the garment steamer with water for the first time I filled the filling cup to the 75ml mark. I had about 20ml left in the cup when the garment steamer reached the max line. I would have liked it if the garment steamer had a larger reservoir as this one seems to deplete quicker than I would like.While using the steaming feature, when it is first turned on it tends to spit a little. It does smooth out and provide a steady stream of steam. The steam seems to come out of mainly the larger center hole. If you have to steam anything upside down, this won't do it. The water pickup doesn't seem to be designed to suck up the water when upside down. It does however work in every other position until the water gets too low.I do like it comes with a resting pad designed to place the hot surface on. If it weren't for that I'm not sure what I would put it on. It isn't designed to be layed on its side. And the one time I did leave it on its side for a few minutes, some water leaked out the fill cap, which was secured, I checked.How does it work on the garments you ask? Rather well I must say. Aside from its shortcomings, small reservoir, no power switch, no temperature control, fluctuating temperature, leaks when on its side, oh yea, too short a cord...my garments came out wrinkle free. I will tell you the spouse also wishes it held more water, \"a lot more\" as she puts it.Now, how many stars do I give/take away. There are a quite a few things I've mentioned which fall short on my needs list. And yet the end result is good. Unfortunately I give only 2/5 stars.",
