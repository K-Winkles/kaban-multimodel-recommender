Since I work more than 60 hours a week, I often throw my scrubs in my bag without thinking too much, and when I get to the hospital, they\u2019re all wrinkly. This steamer is compact and is easy to take on the go since it\u2019s pretty small. Set up is incredibly simple and instructions were very easy to follow. No more wrinkly scrubs at work for me!!",

                "reviewText": "This steam iron is the smallest and most convenient one I have ever used. I like to travel with it because it is light and small. And it can be used in two ways. For example, it can be picked up and ironed vertically, and it can also be ironed flat. And it has only one button, which shows the switch. It is very simple and convenient to operate. The only drawback is that it has too little space for water. It can only iron one of clothing full of water. But I still like it very much. It is worth five stars. If it is used for travel, I highly recommend it.",

The quick heat up and portability served the purpose.",
