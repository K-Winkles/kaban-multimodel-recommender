There is no difference between the ones you get with the mop and these ones, other than the name on the tag. They are nice and thick, and absorb a whole lot. I can\u2019t stress enough how perfectly they fit, they are nice and snug and don\u2019t budge a bit. They are really well built and look as though they will last a long time. I machine wash mine and lay flat to dry. They include the pocket on the inside too for the scented puck. *if that puck loses its smelling power, I just add essential oils to it to give it an extra boost! They were a great price for how many I got too!I would most definitely purchase these cleaning pads again and I highly recommend them!",
