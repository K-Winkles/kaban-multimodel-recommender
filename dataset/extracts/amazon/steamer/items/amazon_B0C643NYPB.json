I travel for work several times a year and some clothes cannot be ironed so a streamer is needed. This one, it has a folding handle so it packs small in the suitcase. The biggest surprise was how much steam this generates. I've used it a couple of times and it has worked out really well. The water tank is small but that is to be expected due to the size of this steamer. During the last two business trips when I used it, it didn't leak in any way. worked really well. To avoid any issues with clogging, I used distilled water. I was able to pick some up from nearest Walmart during my business trip.I highly recommend it.",

We tested it prior to leaving and it worked great. We packed it in our carry-on luggage to ensure it would be protected. When we went to use it a second time it did not steam and leaked water everywhere. It sadly was a waste of money and waste of space in our luggage.",
