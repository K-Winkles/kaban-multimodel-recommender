                "reviewText": "Clothes steamers have one basic job - heat up fast and provide great, continuous steam without coughing, spurting, dripping endless streams of water on you clothes, etc. This inexpensive CONAIR steamer does a better job of making billowing steam than any steamer I have ever owned or used, from pro Jiffy Steamers >$200 to <$15 cheap handheld steamers (good for travel and a few minutes of home steaming but not for everyday or prolonged use.) I've owned and replaced two PurSteam steamers during the past few years. I thought they were pretty great for the money, until the last one just died on me one day (a fatal water leak)) and then I discovered this undersung CONAIR STEAMER. This is the most awesome inexpensive steamer I have ever used. It puts out loads and loads of high-quality steam, without stopping; it just keeps on steaming. While the PurSteam models were constantly taking a break to recycle before they started steaming again (always at the wrong times, of course) the CONAIR STEAMER does not stop. It doesn't sprut tons of water (the occasional drops, yes) and its abundant hot steam takes care of wrinkles in a flash. To be sure, there are compromises in any item that functions at such a high level and sells for such a low price. The Conair Steamers doesn't like to move even though it's on castors, they're so cheap they hardly roll; the potential of tipping over the steamer when trying to move it is also too great. The tank and body of the steamer are made from plastic that seems adequate but not exceptional. The hose and wand and hanger support are great. An attachment brush for the wand head would be a really useful addition, even if made available at additional cost. The cord placement and the hose's stiffness will sometimes join forces to make moving the steamer even more of a pain. But none of these negative comments, at least during the past 2 months I've owned and used this steamer every day, not one of these shortfalls affects the basic operation of this unit. The CONAIR STEAMER is certainly a best buy in the world of clothes steamers for home. Its steam output can go up against ANY of its competitors at twice, 3x and 4x the price and hold its own. All for $45? Seems incredible but true. And when you've finished steaming all of your clothes, your sheets and blanket and draperies, drag the steamer into your bathroom and steam away every last germ, stain and spot on your tile, hardware and porcelain fixtures. You'll wonder how you ever lived without endless steam at your disposal 24/7/365! Nice job Conair! Thank you!",

It was very easy to set up and doesn't take up too much space thanks to the telescoping hanger pole. Clips and the bottom make it easy to secure any garment and steam out the wrinkles right away. It heats up in 30 seconds and once you turn it off the steam stops coming out (so you don't have to worry about cool down time like an iron) Also - you cant ruin your clothes! They're not going to burn or be destroyed if you stay on one spot too long, another bonus! I've noticed my wife using it too, even though she made fun of me after i used christmas money to buy it! If you don't like ironing, or have things that shouldn't be ironed (suits, nice dresses etc) then this is certainly worth the investment.",

                "reviewText": "I use professional steam irons at work. I can't see how it would be possible to have the same thing at home. There's just too much involved.With that said, I did have some idea of what would be required to get a good steamer for my home. I knew the little handheld ones would be a joke.This steamer works pretty good. Be sure to use distilled water please. You can buy a gallon for less than a dollar at the grocery store. Regular water has too much sediment and will clog your products quick.The steamers at work have some power behind the steam making it possible to get wrinkles out quickly. This steamer doesn't do that. I found I had to linger for a longer period of time over wrinkles. I think ironing would be quicker if that's an option. I'm always changing my curtains and you can't avoid wrinkles with them. After burning a hole in a curtain panel with my iron I decided a steamer would be a better option for me. I won't be taking the exuberant amount of time involved to steam my clothes though.Secondly, the hose. I'm 5'5\" and that's how high the hose reaches. I cannot reach above my head with it. While annoying, I believe I'm spoiled because of the freedom of reach I have at work with their steamers. It's not a deal breaker for me. After assembly the hose wouldn't reach the hanger at the top of the pole, but once the steamer was in operation the hose loosened up and fit comfortably where it's supposed to rest.I steamed 2 very wrinkled curtain panels and it took the whole tank and probably a half hour. I didn't time myself, might have been longer. I have low ceilings and was steaming under a smoke alarm. It caused the alarm to go off. Lesson learned.The clasps on the pole to hold your clothes are TIGHT! I'm 54 and my grip isn't what it used to be. I had to squeeze with all my strength to open one. I won't be able to use them.After all that complaining I do still recommend this product. As you can see, my complaints aren't all that severe. It holds a generous amount of water, doesn't leak, is quiet, and does get wrinkles out. I believe they put a lot of thought into making it and that it's price tag is fair if you plan to steam often. Take the time to read the directions sent with the product.As a person that gets paid to steam I'd like to make a couple recommendations to make your steaming easier.Go in the direction of the wrinkle. If it's a horizontal wrinkle then move the steamer head horizontal.For difficult wrinkles pull the fabric tight, run steam over it while holding the fabric tight, then remove the steam while holding the fabric tight, wait about 5-10 seconds then let go of the fabric.Be sure the wrinkle is getting the actual steam and not just the edge of your steamer head when going across the fabric.A steamer is not like an iron. You cannot press down on your fabric with it or you will make wrinkles that will be next to impossible to get back out. It's best to not touch the fabric with the steamer head at all and use your hands to make the fabric flat.",
