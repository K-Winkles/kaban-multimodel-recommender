This EAVE high-tech hand steam cleaner has a button to lock the steam and let it out automatically without keeping holding trigger during use, no any continuous hand pressure or hand fatigue any longer, also no hands fall off before you\u2019re halfway done. Unlimited Use Time(Add Water Anytime During Use) The water in the tank lasts longer(max load: 270ml), and the improved design that allows you to add water anytime during use makes it last infinitely. The endless use time is made for large projects and quick jobs without focusing you on waiting, for example: wait 3-4 minutes to heat up the first use, and wait for it to stop to reheat again and again, wait to cool down to open lid for adding water, spending more time waiting instead of steam cleaning. Large Water Tank With Visible Water Level Window The 270ml(9.13oz) capacity stands to be much longer than most, and the reduced weight(1.2kg unit) isn\u2019t that heavy to get hand tired. The 2 visible windows showing max water level and min water level give you the hint to stop when tank is refilling full and add water when low water level without guesswork. The well-sealed tank never leaks whatever angle you position it while using.",

This is the most effective steam cleaner with strong steam blast up to 120\u2103, not a \"mist machine\" like most not hot enough to clean. So, it's no need to add detergent for steam cleaning, the water steam power is enough to work on almost anything! 2. It is forbidden to add the detergent into the steam cleaner due to the high temperature and pressure inside the water tank. For quick cleaning, spray the detergent on the stain to soften it.3. Capacity of water tank is 290ml, but in order to get best experience, we suggest that add no more than 270ml WATER AT A TIME, so as to leave a certain space to ensure normal use.4. After cleaning done, leave the steam cleaner machine for a period of time. After cooling, pour out the remaining water.5. Input voltage of this cleaning machine is 120V~, 60Hz, and it needs an outlet to work while using. It can continuously work for about 10minutes without intervals per fill and you can add water anytime during use.6. The device requires a short run-in time. At the start, the steam output is very irregular and damp, single droplets of water may leak out shortly.7. In self-cleaning mode the steamer will only spray water instead of steam to clean the inside, please check and select the correct mode before use!",

This one will not heat up while on LOCK only when UNLOCK is selected and at first I was not impressed. The steam was low and weak but it was only about 15 seconds, then it starts to improve I\u2019m guessing as the water picks up heat and it will begin to release a super strong, cloudy steam. So that was different from previous steamer which I had to wait about 20 minutes for it to be ready but it would stay hot. Nonetheless, it\u2019s just a minor change, I\u2019m really enjoying it, the squeegee attachment works very well, so easy to clean my windows now, highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This little steam cleaner is mighty for its size! It's light weight and compact. The cord is nice and long and easy to use. You can change the attachments in between by turning off the continuous steam because it does get hot so wear gloves or use a hot pad just in case. One small draw back but no reason to under rate it is the water capacity is just over 1 cup, which means having to have the fill cup with water in it nearby to continue to work on large jobs like an entire bathroom, sink, toilet, shower, etc...Otherwise, it does the job of removing dirt, grease, soap scum and grime and cleaning grout and water stains. My recommendation would be is to have the area you are cleaning dust free before using the steam cleaner! I didn't post pics bc there are a sufficient amount available in the product reviews/description. I do recommend this product to anyone wanting an extra clean house like me! \ud83d\udc4d",
