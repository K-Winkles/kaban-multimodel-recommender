                "reviewText": "I purchased this mainly because I needed to clean my grout. I live in an apartment and I could tell that gray/black was not it's original color it was meant to have.I did try cleaning the grout by hand, but it was taking too much time and effort for such a lousy result.And wow, I purchased this, I turned it on, and it blasted the dirt away. Stuck on paint.. gone. Stuck on glue... gone. Stuck on whatever that is.. gone. Stains I could never get out by hand scrubbing for hours.. gone in mere seconds.1. It's expensive, but worth every penny for cleaning my home the way I wished it to be for the longest time.2. A lot of these negative reviews are straight up bologna.. here's why:- the cord is meant to be heavy. It's boiling water and actively making steam in 30 seconds. Would you rather have a thin flimsy cable that can be torn or burnt?- the steamer itself is heavy. Yes, but it has the power required to do the job you bought it for. I would not want to skimp on that for the price of the item. Work those arms!- for the broken window review, you probably used it on thin glass in the middle of winter. Yes, temperature is going to affect that.- for those that thought this product wasn't intuitive enough to figure out: you're lying. The manual is 10 small pages. This isn't a rocket and it has 3 simple buttons.- for those that said that it didn't work, they probably were not applying pressure and just expected the steam to hit it and perform a miracle. I'm sorry, but no, a little elbow grease is required for any cleaning job, with or without a machine.3. The tools DO wear down. That is not ideal. But really that is my only complaint. -- P.S. the grout tool wore down too quickly and I still had stains visible in my grout. Switched out for the thicker bristle one and voila!! Dirt gone. ****but as the manual states, test in a smaller spot first, and it's not recommended for use on fragile/softer surfaces****4. Yes, I've had to make several passes to get the dirt out of the grout. But atleast I had this product to make it easier on me. Plus, I don't think the grout has ever been cleaned prior to me moving in. That's a lot of compounded dirt and grime layering for years.5. There's 3 buttons: low steam, pause, and high steam. Yes, there isn't a \"power off\" button. Hit pause and unplug it. No power = power off.Overall, I am satisfied and recommend this tool. I love this steam mop. Don't listen to the negative reviews and get this tool if you have tough cleaning jobs to do around your house. It does it all, all in one tool. Versatile, effective, and simple to use.",

All of the pieces and attachments were still in their original packaging! SCORE.This thing works amazing, takes the scrubbing out of deep cleaning my house (which is great because I have wrist problems)!! Yes it is a little heavy as other reviews mentioned but it\u2019s a heavy duty cleaner, well worth the weight in my opinion. They have another indoor only option that is probably lighter, but this one didn\u2019t bother my frail wrists at all compared to the scrubbing I would be doing otherwise \ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to clean grout and it does a great job, but you will go through the grout cleaning attachments for sure. Would be nice if the bristles were thicker and more durable like on the round brush attachment. That is why I gave it 4 stars due to how fast the attachments wear out (some quicker than others even with regular scrubbing and not overly vigorous). When I read reviews prior to buying this steamer I thought perhaps people were not allowing the steamer to do its job and scrubbing to hard, but even with several passes of steam you still need to scrub so it\u2019s inevitable that you will wear out several attachments. But steam is the only thing that has cleaned my grout! No chemicals have worked. So this has been worth the labor it has taken to get my cream grout looking fabulous again. Also worked in the shower where rust has gotten into the grout. Very happy with the results!! I also used this steamer on my wood floors. So far everything has been great. You can\u2019t go wrong with cleaning with steam as it disinfects without chemicals and looks great.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a house that had dogs, smokers, and went a long time without proper cleaning. This ended up a being an invaluable purchase for restoring this property. I've used this for:- Removing Paint from hard surfaces- Removing old tape residue from windows, etc.- Removing old stick-on-shelf liner- Cleaning cooking grease off walls- Cleaning tobacco staining off everything- Cleaning grout of years of grime- Cleaning off soot from fireplace- Cleaning Wood FloorsIt outputs quite a bit of steam, and really does a good job loosening up pretty much anything. It's pretty heavy, so if you're doing a large area, you could get a bit fatigued. I used it to loosen up the tobacco staining on the ceiling, and I got pretty sore. When combined with conventional cleaning methods, I think I could manage to clean just about anything.A word of warning. If you're cleaning painted or veneered surfaces, do not stay in place for too long. It will cause the veneer or paint to lose adhesion or bubble up. There's one spot on my cabinet were I made that mistake, and it will haunt me forever. Not the product's fault though. On the other hand, that means it's really good for removing the same. I used it to easily remove paint from windows, faucets, toilets, tile, etc, as well remove years old masking tape that was never removed (previous owners were not master painters, that's for sure...). I also used it to peel up old stick-on shelf liner, which is normally a huge pain, but was a breeze with the steam/scraper tool.Other than the main mop head, the accessories aren't particularly great. I'd like their engineers/designers to spend a little more time think about how the tool is used and improving the accessories, and making them more durable. Replacements are all available on their website though.The fabric steamer tool, which turns into the flat surface tool with a little attachment, broke pretty easily, and the flat surface tool isn't well designed to hold the pads that come with it. It also doesn't swivel like the main mop head, so it's a lot harder to use. The scrubber tools are flimsy and wear out quickly. I found it was more effective to just blast it with the concentrator nozzle and scrub it separately with my preferred brush (careful not to burn yourself, you can). The concentrator nozzle is nice, but they only have one with a 45 degree elbow. It'd be nice if they included a straight one as well. The little scraper tool is pretty good for peeling up tape.The unit did stop steaming after about 4 months of heavy use. It took about 20 minutes with Bissel's chat support through their website to get a warranty replacement sent, so I'd say that's a pretty good result.",
