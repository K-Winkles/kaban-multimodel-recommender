I ordered this steamer and was pleased with it until I used it to steam curtains that were returned from the cleaners very wrinkly. Full disclosure, it was a large job (12 panels) which took 7 hours to do in several afternoons. After 6 hours of use, the steamer began to spit out water in large quantities. I had to run out an buy a replacement (different brand) to finish the job. When I went to return it through Amazon's site, I was informed that this distributor did not allow returns. Because the product was obviously faulty, there should be some recourse especially for a $50 item.",
