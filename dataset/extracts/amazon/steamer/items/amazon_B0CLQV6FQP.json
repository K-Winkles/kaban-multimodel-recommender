                "reviewText": "This is advertised as a steamer, and, well...it steams. There's nothing fancy about it nor does it need to be, like any other steamer it tends to get the wrinkles out of clothes and works well. The only difference is the price point, where this one is a bit more affordable than the others.This steamer is a good bang for your buck product, it works well, it's on the cheaper end, so pretty solid option if you're looking for deals.",
