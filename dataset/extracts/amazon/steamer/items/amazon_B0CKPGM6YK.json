I will say the output is not very strong, but that has so far prevented me from a) burning myself and b) clothes from getting wet streaks (which is awful if you\u2019re steaming with the intention of immediately using your clothes as I do so often). I also find that due to this, the water in the chamber (which isn\u2019t sizable) lasts much longer and I can get a few small outfits steamed with one fill. Its lightweight, super compact, starts steaming immediately, and as of yet I have nothing to complain about. Will update if so.",

                "reviewText": "The fact that it is so lightweight and simple to use makes it an ideal companion for those who are always on the go. It has been my experience that this steamer is an effective and space-saving option, regardless of whether I am ironing my clothes at home or when I am traveling. The rapid heat-up time of fifteen seconds is not only a boast; it is a fact for the product. To my joyful surprise, the steamer was ready for use in a very short amount of time, which allowed me to save a significant amount of time, particularly during those busy mornings. The fact that you do not have to wait around for the steamer to reach the appropriate temperature is a significant leap forward in terms of convenience. In terms of performance, I found that the ten minutes of continuous steam were more than enough for revitalizing and de-wrinkling a number of different pieces of clothing. It handled everything with ease, from delicate textiles to bulkier materials, and it provided a continuous and forceful steam flow throughout the whole machine.",
