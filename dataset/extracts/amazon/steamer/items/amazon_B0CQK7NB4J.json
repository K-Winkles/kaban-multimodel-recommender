I can clean a larger area, i.e. more rooms, by not having to stop to wash the two pads. Now, I can do several rooms using the original two pads and 2 of these, depending on my needs. These pads don't fit exactly with my steamer which has a square head so the pads protrude a little on the front and back. However, they attach snuggly and don't shift while in use. The scrubbing pad works well for more stubborn areas such as the kitchen. The pads are well made and I'm expecting a long life out of them. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "These replacement pads for my steam mop are great. They are almost identical to the ones that came with it. To have a few extra is so nice. The striped ones are soft and work nicely. The orange ones are a little more rough and work great to scrub harder problem areas. You just toss them in the wash to clean them. I love the sustainability.",
