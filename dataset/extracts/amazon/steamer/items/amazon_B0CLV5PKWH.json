I hate dragging out a big ironing board and giant iron every time, so I thought this handy little travel steamer would take some of the work out of getting dressed. It heats up quickly, so be careful of the water - it leaks and drips, and it will spit hot water all over your clothes and ironing board. DO NOT use on anything that shows water spots, like rayon or silk, because it WILL ruin it for good - USE A PRESS-CLOTH BETWEEN THE IRON AND FABRIC, if it's decent or nice fabric. It's good for jeans, some cotton shirts, or flannel, but keep it away from your nice clothes. I should have known better, but the box depicts a steam flow that would perfectly de-wrinkle a canvas tarp, but don't fall for this like i kind of did. It's nothing like that. It's a tiny, strange little steam iron that will work well traveling, once you get the hang of it. A Fahrenheit scale would be nice , and I wish it had a pointy end to get in small places. I would say it's okay, but a little misrepresented with the steam picture on the box. I think this iron is fine, and I would take it on a trip where I wasn't preregistered in a hotel/motel, just in case... 4 stars",

                "reviewText": "Keep in mind I do very little ironing because I\u2019ve never been good at it and only a few of my clothing items get wrinkled. I got this in case I need to smooth out a shirt if I plan on dressing up a bit. Now that we got that out of the way, this little iron seems like it will fit the bill. I tested it on an older shirt in case I did something wrong. I made an \u201cironing board \u201c using a towel on the granite kitchen counter. The iron heated up in a reasonable amount of time. I didn\u2019t use the steam option. I set it to what the shirt label said and away I went. The handy setting indicator worked well. Between my inexperience and the homemade ironing board the shirt came out noticeably smoother and acceptable to me. I think this will suit my needs. I imagine if you need to do a pile of ironing you\u2019d want a bigger heavier iron but for small jobs this will certainly do the job. I will need to get an ironing board now.",
