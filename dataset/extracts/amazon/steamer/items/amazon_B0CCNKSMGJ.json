I liked that there was a tray that you can use to rest the iron on. It also comes with a pouch for storage. Good item to have if you need to freshen up clothes while traveling. I would have liked the option to set a temperature although according the insert, you can iron silk, cotton and blended fabrics. I would probably use the steam function the most just to be on the safe side but nice to have the iron if a fabric needs more pressing.",

                "reviewText": "This little iron/steamer is wonderful for someone who doesn't iron too often and/or lacks space. I also only need a steamer on occasion. It is very well made. I love how the handle turns perpendicular to the iron to use as the handle for the steamer. It comes with a nice bag to store it in. It has a resting flat tray to set it in when hot. It heats up super fast! It takes longer to cool down. The directions were a bit unclear as to whether you had to hold the steamer button continually or not when steaming (you don't). It both irons and steams out wrinkles nicely. Obviously it takes a little longer to iron a piece of clothing with such a little iron but that's to be expected. I do wish the cord was a little longer thus 4 stars. It would be easy to take when traveling too.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a portable steamer to take with me on my trips for a long time. I already own one, but it\u2019s way too big and bulky. When I saw this portable steamer that also works as an iron, I was sold!I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the steamer. It has a clean minimalist design with rounded edges and a rotatable handle that can be set perpendicular to the body for easier holding while steaming.The iron side is made of a teflon-like material, so it\u2019s easy to clean, and the plastic casing is solid and of good quality. It comes with a tray that has silicone contact points, so you don\u2019t have to worry about setting the steamer down and burning something. I also like the little details that were included, like the little water cup, which makes filling the steamer with water much easier, and the travel bag to conveniently store all the items.As soon as I got it, I tested it by steaming a very wrinkly jacket, and this little but mighty steamer removed all the wrinkles in less than five minutes! This little guy will be my best friend during trips where I have to go to formal events or parties. Overall, I give this steamer five stars because it not only delivers on all aspects, but it is well designed and comes with everything you need to take it with you on trips.",

I like steamers because they're more convenient in that you don't need an ironing board or flat surface to use it.However I feel like an iron can be faster and maybe even capable of making your clothes a little more \"crisp\" if you will.I gave a four star review NOT because of product performance (which it worked great as a steamer and an iron) but because of my own concern for possible injury and/or potential to burn things.I can see a family using this with one person using it as an iron and another person using it but not realizing it was used as an iron instead of a steamer and burning themselves. Or it accidentally being set down somewhere thinking it's in steamer mode but it actually being in iron mode and burning something on accident.Like I said to be fair to this product I want to be clear that my score of 4 stars has nothing to due with the performance of this item but rather the danger that I can see potentially taking place because of its design.",

It heat quickly and having the option to steam out wrinkles or iron them is a great dual feature. The cord is on the short side but most likely you will be using this on counter top or dresser top if there is no full size ironing board in the room. This will be used only when we travel for business or pleasure. It comes with a travel bag and a base to set it on when it is hot. I am very pleased with this compact steamer/iron",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a decent option for travel. I like that it can steam and be used as a flat iron. It heats up very quickly.But it isn\u2019t the smallest of the travel steamers and it doesn\u2019t have heat settings. I have also had some issues with water leaking when using it to iron.All of that being said, it does the job of getting wrinkles out better than most of the travel steamers I\u2019ve tried.",
