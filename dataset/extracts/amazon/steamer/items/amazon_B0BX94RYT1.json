They almost fall off when lifting the unit up off ground.You can bump the pad with your little finger and it will fall off where as the original pads take a bit of effort to pull them off.Cleaning wise they do the job, to fix the issue I am thinking of attaching some stronger velcro to the pads.In fact I was very close to requesting a refund but I will see if stronger Velcro works.",
