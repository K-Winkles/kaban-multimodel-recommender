                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice Compact Design with Excellent Steam Generation",
                "reviewText": "Needed a compact system and generous steam and ironing function. Easy to assemble, will likely last long as long as I\u2019m not rough with it. The product was designed well and it\u2019s sturdy.Cons: the board is not very big. When ironing shirts the sleeves hit the floor. Would have been fantastic if there was a window to see how much water is in the tank. Or a similar funnel that my older steam iron had with a little pop up indicator so you knew to stop pouring. As it stands now, I find out when it over flows.That aside, it\u2019s a nice all-in-one compact unit that stores well and generates enough steam to get the wrinkles out without soaking the item you\u2019re ironing. It\u2019s does have some weak spots but shouldn\u2019t be an issue as long as I handle with care.I even made a slip cover to put over it to keep it clean when not in use which should help keep it in good shape for longer.Important Note: The first one I received arrived damaged. It was an unfortunate, irregular type of damage that I\u2019m sure doesn\u2019t happen often, but to ensure your product arrives in perfect condition you may want to check the box that says something about using an Amazon shipping carton in addition to the product box (found on the last page of checkout - follows somewhere after your chosen payment method).NEW INPUT:I\u2019ve had some time to use this unit and find it to almost make the mark. The areas that could be improved are:1). ironing board size and stability leg. The size is just too small. If it was at least two inches wider it would be better. With the narrow size and how low it is, all shirts end up touching the floor at one point which isn\u2019t ideal.2). The stability leg doesn\u2019t lock in place well and if you\u2019re ironing with any pressure it slides down (gets shorter).3) The boiler - would have been awesome if there was a level indicator so you knew how much water it can take when filling and how close you are to running out.5) Steam is strong but clothes end up rather damp and have to lay flat or be hung before folding due to dampness.4) The clothing steamer/hanger. Is a great concept except any item that you have hanging that us as wide as the side bars will lay up against the hot iron while in its holder or get in the way of using the iron holder. The top hanger holder could be a couple of inches longer so the clothes clear the area around the iron.The positives are its overall design - easy to store and use. The boiler holds a good amount of water so you can iron for over an hour without having to refill. I\u2019m trying to be careful not to handle it roughly since it is mostly plastic. All-in-all I\u2019m happy. Just need to adjust the way I use steam to avoid over saturating the clothing. Since I iron in the garage I have to lay a towel on the floor so my sleeves don\u2019t get dirty due to the lower height of the ironing surface.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I am very happy with this all-in-one steamer and iron, and I love the convenience and how much space it saves. The iron and the steamer function as expected, and the water tank is large enough to steam and iron an entire week's worth of clothing.The steam produced by this unit is high-pressure and can quickly turn your room into a sauna if you overdo it. Strangely enough, my old steamer that emitted a steady, gentle stream was far more effective at removing wrinkles, but this steamer will still do the trick. The iron functions just as well as a full-sized iron, and the ironing board is very easy to use and then fold back up into the unit.On the downside, I really wish there were wheels on the bottom of this unit so it could be moved easily. I also wish there was an easy-to-see on/off button, and the cool/ hot lights were larger and easier to see while ironing my clothes. Draining the remaining water from the unit is cumbersome, and there is no way to see how much water is in the tank.While there are some trade-offs to getting an all-in-one unit, this is a good choice if you need to save space or prefer the convenience.",
