Overall it is very easy to use and worked exactly as planned. It would have been nice if the box had directions on the outside or better yet pictures with directions. The manual was tiny and I didn't bother to read it but figured it out without much effort. I like that it comes with a small cup for pouring water where it needs to go. It takes 20 seconds to warm up and then it makes quick work of wrinkles. Everything folds up neatly and fits into a little travel bag that comes with it and the whole thing fit neatly into my baggage. Really good product for those of us living in small apartments also.",

                "reviewText": "A travel steamer is one of those things you never thought you needed, but comes in handy whenever the situation calls for it.For me, it was a last minute overnight trip when I was invited to a formal dinner/celebration. I had to bring my formal wear--3 piece suit, dress shirt, tie, the whole shebang--and it had to fit in my carrying size suitcase for easy transportation via the back of a sedan. However we all know that my (as well as everyone else's) outfit is gonne be wrinkled af once I take it out and hang it up. If only I had a steamer with me....And that's where this comes in! It won't rival your sfully decked out steamed you may have at home, but it's not supposed to; it serves as a much more convenient solution when in the go or constantly traveling for business trips or situation that require formal wear and you NEED to get rid of those wrinkles ASAP. It steams clothes pretty well for something so small and compact, and the handle folds down to a more travel-friendly size.So is it the BEST steamer? No. Is it one of the best travel steamers you can get at this price point and a handy travel partner? Yes!",

It is small, foldable and light and more importantly - it works! No matter how I pack my cotton and linen clothes they always get wrinkled and need ironing before I put them on. The steam iron gets the wrinkles and creases out quickly and leaves my clothes clean and sanitized. It holds enough water to iron several items and I like that it can be used in vertical and horizontal positions as well. The storage pouch makes it easier to pack in my suitcase and now I won't leave home without it. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "The product is easy to use, and the manual has clear instructions. It folds up to have a small profile and comes with its own travel bag. The product heats up quickly and produces a good amount of steam. Although, I did find the chord to be rather short, so if you can\u2019t find an outlet very close to where you plan on steaming, than you are out of luck.However, the major issue with this product is that upon the product heating up, I immediately notice a very strong odor, like plastic burning. This is very concerning to say the least. The odor is not just cause for concern, but very harsh and noxious and lingers for a long time after use. It definitely raises serious health and safety concerns about the product.Bottomline, due to the aforementioned health and safety concerns, I can\u2019t recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "PROS:* The device produces a lot of steam very quickly, usually within the described 20 seconds of it being turned on.* There is a user manual (English) that is adequate for essential understanding.* There is contact information included in the package even though it looks like a disposable email.CONS:* Device electrical specification are designed for 110 VAC at 50 Hz. North American, including my community operates at 60 Hz.* Although the packaging claims to be CE certified (for the European domain), I do not see any evidence of American UL or Canadian CSA electrical certifications.* When in use, the device emits a harsh chemical burning-like odor as if plastic is melting.* One time when I installed the water reservoir, the main device case split open! I happen to have the device plugged in. This was a very dangerous safety situation. I was able to snap the device main casing back together, but it did not look very confidently designed. See the attached images.* There is no control for the volume of steam generated. You might find yourself refilled the water reservoir often.* If your garment has an acute crease, expect to use a traditional iron to clear it. This device doesn't seem to affect it.* Be careful with your free hand when using the device. Intermittently it will spit out a blob of extremely hot water. This will burn your free hand.SUMMARY:Functionally the product delivers what it said it does. But the harsh burning smell, the electrical certification inconsistency and the failed casing among the list of cons stages the product as being potentially unsafe. I believe the presented opinion rating is perhaps generous.Consumers beware.",
