                "reviewText": "I am the director of a ballet studio and I needed a new steamer to prepare costumes for our concert (the steamer we had, despite being full-size, was absolutely worthless). I didn't want to spend a lot of money and saw that this one was highly rated.This steamer is quite small and doesn't hold much water, but it is *very* effective. I was able to steam dozens of garments (mostly tulle) fairly quickly with it, and they turned out great. I just kept a jug of water on hand to keep refilling the water reservoir when it got empty.When you first heat it up, the steamer does have a tendency to spurt. I recommend not starting to steam immediately when the water boils, but wait about 20 seconds. Then, as long as you keep it upright, the steam output is consistent and there are few to no water spurts.The steamer is very portable - it would easily fit in a carry-on or overnight bag. The power cord is a bit short, but if you plugged it in above a bathroom sink it would be fine (I just used an extension cord). It's so lightweight that you can use it for a long time and your arm won't get tired.I'm very satisfied with this purchase and am glad to have a reliable steamer at my studio now.",

                "reviewText": "First things first, I travel a good amount for work. Most of the time for out of country trips to tropical climates so the clothes I bring are light fabrics that wrinkle easily and I absolutely loathe irons/ironing boards... so you now understand my struggle. I was already familiar with steamers as I had a large one a few years back that I loved but it was cumbersome so I gave it to my roommate. Now it's 2 years later and I found myself in need of an ironing solution for both home and travel. As usual I started my search on amazon and looked at a few different models before settling on this one, despite the negative reviews which to be honest did make me nervous and here is my experience:This little steamer is fantastic and takes up about as much space in my suitcase as a pair of shoes! Yes, there are even smaller \"more\" portable steamers on the market but to me the idea of having to refill the water and wait for it to heat up again for one piece of clothing was not worth the little bit more of suitcase space I could've saved. It heats up within a minute and I can steam a full maxi dress in one fill with this little beast! You do have to get this steamer pretty close to the fabric (for most effective/quick steaming I rub the steamer nozzle directly on the fabric just as you would a normal iron - except vertical of course) as with the full sized steamers the nozzle can be held an inch or two away from the item. Mine does spit water occasionally but it is VERY minimal (1-3 drops per use) and it's normally completely dry and not noticeable by the time I walk out the door/get to where I'm going. Every once in a while it goes through a short period of time while its running that the steam almost comes to a stop for roughly 20-30 seconds (I've come to realize this is not a product flaw but rather the steamer regulating its temperature so it doesn't overheat and break). This shouldn't effect you very much if the nozzle is directly on the clothes as it is still extremely hot so I use this 'cool down' period for tinier wrinkle spots and the edges as I've almost burnt my fingers a few times while trying to de-wrinkle hems while the steamer was going full blast. I also like how long the cord is, which to be honest I originally thought would be a nuisance but I just wrap the cord around the neck of the steamer and it adds barely any bulk to its packing size. In addition to light fabrics I have also used this to steam a 8 foot long tablecloth that I bring along for work. To be fair I only did the front side of the table cloth and it worked wonderfully even over the logo part but it did take me 2 refills so this steamer may not be ideal if you need a steamer for really large items, but that's pretty obvious already by its size. I personally will continue to use this steamer for the giant table cloth since the pros outweigh the cons for my situation.I've had this steamer for less than a month and it's already been used over a dozen times, made it through international travel and shows no signs of slowing down! For the price, you can't beat this deal :)",

Occasionally it spits water while heating, but I've just emptied it and started over and it resolves that issue. I'm not sure why it does that only sometimes. But overall it has been a game-changer!",

                "reviewText": "If you select the one star reviews, you will find issues nearly identical to mine, and I wish I\u2019d read all the critical reviews before purchasing. With so many excellent reviews I wasn\u2019t too concerned and unfortunately for me, that didn\u2019t work out. As some others have stated, mine also arrived with some oil on the outside of the steamer near the connection point of the two pieces. I cleaned it off, rinsed out the steamer and gave it a go. The first time, the steamer worked as it should and I was pretty excited. I was steaming a light jersey skirt (an easy fabric to test) and needed to refill the water. After letting it cool down and then refilling and turning on once again, the water boiled right out the top of the steamer in huge quantities. It boils so much out the top that it quickly runs out and has no water to even steam a garment. I didn\u2019t overfill the tank. I didn\u2019t tilt it down too far on an angle. This happened again and again every single time after that original successful use. So not only does it not work, it\u2019s also a burn hazard! This is probably the worst purchase I\u2019ve ever made on Amazon. Not sure if the other reviews are fake or if the quality control just isn\u2019t there. Seems like if you get a good one you\u2019ll be ok but those who got a defective one all had the same troubles! Really wanted this to take on an upcoming weekend trip but it will be returned. On the hunt for a new one.",
