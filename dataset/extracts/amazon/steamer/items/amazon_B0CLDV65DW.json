It does a fantastic job of taking out wrinkles. The tank is a decent size. Only criticism is that it's difficult to get all the unused water out of the tank when you're done, but that's typical for devices with water tanks. Easier to just steam it all out. Very happy, so much better than busting out an iron and ironing board.",
