                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Durable mop pads for the price",
                "reviewText": "My first order was back in April 2018 as a supplement to the two mop pads that come with the Bissell Powerfresh steam mop, and these mop pads have been phenomenal. How so? They pickup the grim, grit and dirt off the floors, and they clean out well too. Attached is a photo showing how gross the mop pad is after cleaning the floor where our dog sleeps; another photo shows a laundered mop pad next to an unused one. I picked the 'dirtiest' looking laundered mop pad to show how well they do clean out after being laundered. The fit is a bit more snug than the original mop pads that come with the Bissell Powerfresh steam mop; the seams don't fit corner to corner (see photo). However, this does not affect it's cleaning ability or how well it fits and comes off the mop head. After much research last year, and reading other customer's complaints that even the original Bissell brand mop pad replacements are not as nice or fitted as the ones that come in the box, so I opted to try these out instead of purchasing overpriced Bissell brand mop pads. Very glad I got these. Attached is another photo showing this mop pad (on the left) side by side with the original mop pad that came with the steam mop. You can see both have the little pouch for the scent disc if you use them, and if you look closely you can tell this mop pad does have slightly shorter loops but tighter weaves (aka more loops per square inch to clean the floors!) When using this mop pad there is a bit more drag (resistance) at first since the mop pad is thicker than the original, but once it becomes slightly damp it glides easier over the floors. The first set of 8 mop pads that I received was shipped by Amazon warehouse and arrived promptly. I used the heck out of the set! I steamed mopped my floors at least once a day, several times a day on occasion depending on how members of our household treats the floors. So these mop pads had a LOT of use and went through the wash regularly. They held up great! No fraying. No holes. They started thinning a bit at the corners where they get bumped into the walls and furnitures. However, after 7 months of use, and because I was frantically cleaning and prepping for the Thanksgiving holidays, I forgot to wash them. They sat in the cleaning bin, damp and dirty, for about a week. After they were washed there was this mildew smell that wouldn't go away. I tried everything to get the smell out (soak in vinegar, dawn, borax, bleach, even ammonia-not all at once), laundered and soaked, repeat, repeat, and still they smelled. So I ordered another set. The second set was shipped direct by the seller BonusLife all the way from China. Ok, no big deal, my house is pretty clean, I can wait. But after a month, I still hadn't gotten anything. I was aware the government shutdown was slowing everything down. The seller kept me informed of the shipment process as they were receiving updates from the US Postal service. In addition, the seller advised me that they had filled the Amazon warehouse, and I could order direct from the Amazon warehouse if I needed mop pads sooner. So I ordered a third set from Amazon warehouse just after the new year. It arrived promptly, and my floors were clean again. In the meantime, the seller BonusLife refunded my original purchase price for the second set, and told me I could keep the mop pad set when it arrives instead of returning it for the trouble. The set eventually arrived the second week of January, well packaged too. All in all, I am very pleased with the mop pad set and pleasantly surprised at how well the seller handled the delayed order. Highly recommend the product and working with the seller BonusLife.",

Not only are they a great value, they fit better than the Bissell mop pads included with the steam mop.These mop pads are quality made, super soft, thick, and absorbent. They clean my wood floors and bathroom laminate floors efficiently without damaging them. I bought the eight pack and have been using 4 on rotation regularly/weekly. I wash them after every use in hot water, regular detergent, Borax/bleach, dry on high heat and they have held up incredibly well. I believe they\u2019ll last a long time.
