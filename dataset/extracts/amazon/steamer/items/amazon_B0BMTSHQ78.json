                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Nesugar G3 Steamer for my travels. It exceeded my expectations. It is incredibly lightweight and compact, making it perfect for packing in my suitcase. The steamer heats up quickly, allowing me to quickly remove wrinkles from my clothes without any hassle.The steaming time is decent for its size, providing solid minutes of continuous work. I appreciate that it doesn't leave my clothes damp or with water spots, which is a common issue with some steamers. The flexibility of using it in any orientation was also a plus, as I could easily steam clothes whether they were laid flat or hung up.My only minor complaint is that I wish the water reservoir could hold a bit more or that the steamer lasted a little longer. However, considering its compact size, this is a minor inconvenience.Overall, the Nesugar G3 Steamer is a fantastic travel companion. It does its job effectively, takes up minimal space in my luggage, and is incredibly easy to use. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable and convenient steamer for their travels.",

                "reviewText": "Alright, so here's the deal with the Nesugar G3 Travel Steamer:Honestly, it's light. Like, really light. Just picture carrying two smartphones and that\u2019s pretty much the weight of this steamer. Super simple and not a hassle to throw in your bag when you're off for a trip.The steaming time is surprisingly decent for its size. It gives solid minutes of continuous work, and it somehow manages to keep things pretty dry in the process. It\u2019s not shooting out massive clouds of steam, but it\u2019s enough to get the wrinkles out without soaking your clothes, which is a plus in my book.Now, when it comes to using it, it's honestly a piece of cake. It heats up very quick. You've got just one button to worry about, so there\u2019s no fumbling around trying to figure out different settings. Plus, a 6ft power cord comes in handy so you're not tied to the wall socket.The flexibility of using it in any orientation was genuinely useful. Whether I needed to lay something flat or hang it up, the steamer was cooperative in both scenarios. Kind of a dual-use scenario which is really thought through, considering we don\u2019t always have the luxury of an ironing board while traveling.Water spots can be annoying, but didn\u2019t notice any with the G3. It seemed to handle all kinds of fabrics well and didn\u2019t leave them damp or with those annoying spots that some steamers can.So, if you\u2019re someone who likes to keep things crisp while you're on the move, and you're not looking for anything overly complex or bulky, the Nesugar G3 might just be a worthwhile companion. It does its job, doesn\u2019t ask for much space, and it\u2019s pretty foolproof to use. Not too shabby at all!",

Lastly, the hardware is quite sturdy and does not feel as if it would break easily.Worth the money!",
