I got a big wheely boi that failed after one or two uses.This one - this one is not like that. Its compact and small so its not taking up a lot of my closet - huge win! It also heats up and makes a ton of steam after a few uses is still going strong. Its easy to use - just add water, turn on and in minutes you have more steam than you know what to do with.The only downsides are it doesnt have a trigger handle and maybe water volume in the canister since you go through it a lot on the high setting because it works so well.This was, so far, a great purchase and I'm happy with taking the gamble on it.",

The water and stream were very hot and I thought it would just remove the mold one time, but I kept having to go back to the same spot again and again. It's just ok. Maybe it was my grout/mold?",

I have another smaller handheld steam cleaner I purchased to clean the gunk that builds up in the hard to reach places in the bathroom (glass shower door connections sides and bottoms, drain spouts, etc) and this one does a much better job of getting in the cracks and crevices and steaming out dirt, mold, mildew, etc. And steam is a natural cleaner/disinfectant, so you don\u2019t have to use chemical cleaners. This steam cleaner is very well built with a powerful spray! I plan to use it all over the house inside and out! I Love it!",

But with this compact steamer I was able to accomplish it literally in minutes. It lifts dirt fast and effectively, and all you need is just dump the dirt with a rug.The steamer came with a set of accessories, and the loveliest one is a pair of gloves with very soft and nicely felt interior.I am happy with this steamer and can\u2019t wait using it in other projects!",
