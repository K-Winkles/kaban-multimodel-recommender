Is fantastic with wrinkles. Have not traveled with it yet but it\u2019s light weight and compact. It comes with a storage bag. The cord is close to 92 inches. I\u2019m not easily impressed with gadgets but this is worth spreading the word.I\u2019ve bought this compact steamer to iron out the more than several long winter coats I own and was dreading buying that large floor steamer model I used to own and decided to give this compact steamer a try and I must say it functioned exactly like a high power floor model streamer and what a gem it is to any wardrobe.Highly recommend.The only difference between the large floor model and this is compact steamer is you will need to fill this up with water several more times but well worth it by me!This will be my to go last minute for wrinkle issues.Amazon thanks for offering the review system on products.",

My old steamer took several passes to get wrinkles out. Each pass of this little powerhouse ERASED all the wrinkles. The wide head covered a lot of ground quickly. The unit is easy to hold and lightweight even when full, which I was looking for. It came with a nice sturdy travel/storage bag, and a coordinating Velcro tie already in place on the cord. I wasn\u2019t looking for aesthetics, but found the clean lines are very pleasing and easy on the eye! The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the silicone plug for the water tank looks very delicate, and I\u2019m not sure how I will replace it if it breaks (and I anticipate \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif\u201d). Being silicone rather than rubber, I hope it will last a while.",

It makes an out of the package costume come fully back to life, if you have a good 15-20 minutes to spend on it. Game changer for those, hands down.This past Fall I brought it on a Vegas trip with my girlfriends and they were shocked how well it worked on some of our more formal attire, helping us clean up our wrinkled travel look. Since we don't often require this type of maintenance around the house, it's nice that it doesn't take up a huge amount of space and can travel really well. I would highly recommend this item!

                "reviewText": "I loved this little steamer. The first one I bought lasted only a year but I liked it so much that I thought I'd try purchasing it again since it had such great reviews. The second I bought I only used about 4 or 5 times and it stopped working again within 4 months of purchase. I would not buy this item again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "We took this steamer on our first cruise last week and it works even better than ironing!! Heats up super fast, no spitting water on your garment. Light weight. Steamed a long dress with only one fill of the water tank. My daughter loved it so much, she nabbed it for every day use ;). I will be buying another for my home use when back in stock.",

                "reviewText": "This product works very well! I really liked how easy to use it was, it only takes like 10 seconds to warm up so it's super quick. I'll even use this at home instead of an iron and ironing board cause it's way more convenient! It does the job quick. These are two different types of material and I only steamed each for about a minute and it got the wrinkles out great. An amazing idea to have this for traveling especially if you are somewhere for an occasion where you don't want to be wrinkly! Highly recommend.",
