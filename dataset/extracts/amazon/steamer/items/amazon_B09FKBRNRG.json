Press and Turn Safety Cap Press down the safety cap and turn it counterclockwise to open it. NOTE: The cap will not open when the steamer is pressurized. Refill Tank with Cup and Funnel You can use ordinary tap water! Fill the boiler tank with about 8.45 fl oz (250 ml) of water with the included cup. Pour it into the tank using the provided funnel. Do not fill the tank completely or there won\u2019t be room for steam to build. Replace the cap and allow it to reheat. Steam away.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a darn good hand held steamer , my second time purchasing this one . I purchased others after my first one broke but could not find one that holds up to this one . As you can see in the photo and video . I had residue on my burner plate that just would not come off , not even with a sos pad ( and I swear by my Sos pads ) with a little help from my oven cleaner and some hot steam , stain came right out . Sometimes it takes a little more than hot steam to lift some stains but for the most part , it works like a charm . It\u2019s small ( a little cumbersome) because you have to constantly hold down on the handle but I can maneuver it well being I\u2019ve had one for almost 5 years before purchasing a replacement. I find putting on the parts very easy . My old one use to be a pain to unscrew the non , but the new one is very easy . I used tap water in the old one and never had a problem , but this go round I\u2019ll use distilled water as most say it\u2019s better because where I\u2019m from , we have hard water .Now to the Con : the steamer comes with two flimsy brushes that melt easy upon use , most steamers come with at least one hard bristle bush this one comes with 2 soft brushes only . The company DO NOT sell extra brushes but will ship you ONE as long as your under warranty. I don\u2019t need no company rationing off brushes through the mail one at a time for me , let me purchase as many as I want . I love cleaning and I use a brush on most of my cleaning jobs so I need brushes . By the time one brush come in the mail more stains will have build up .Suggestions: they should make and sell short bristle brushed as they might not melt as fast as the long bristle ones that come with the steamer . I know you can\u2019t please everyone but at least sell extra brushes as to some the machine is useless without them . I love my steamer and am now on the prowl to find a brush from another company that will fit this steamer . Will share if I do happen to find one .",

                "reviewText": "This steamer did a great job making steam quickly and it has a lot of attachment options. The water tank can hold more than one measuring cups worth of water and I got a decent amount of steam time before it needed to be refilled. You do have to allow the machine to cool down before you can remove the cap and refill due to the steam pressure that builds. The only small is I have is the bristles on the smaller round scrubber attachment wore down/melted a bit after one use. Overall it did a great job for what I needed and I\u2019m happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "It needs a water gage. I don't like that you can't fill it up if its still got some water in it cause of the pressure bc you can't remove the cap. You are busy you need to be able to just add water and go. It honestly needs a container you can just remove like with the steam mops. I like that its got several attachments. The first time I sprayed mine it was so powerful it actually scared me and made me and the cat jump. wow. i use both hands while spraying. it heats up quick so I like that. I like that it comes with a measuring cup however I think the hole is to small and you have to fill that cup up several times and pour in that funnel. who has time for that. we are busy. again a container that has a bigger hole would be better. now as far as cleaning we have issues. i attempted to clean the bathtub it was dirty it didnt remove any dirt at all. i guess it loosened it some but i still had to get my scrubber and scrub the dirt. i sprayed my oven which was barely dirty and again i had to spray it and scrub it. i sprayed my front door and then wiped it down. i know with my steam mop i mop my floors then i steam mop. so I guess with this I'll clean then spray it with this to just give it an extra touch cause it didnt actually remove any dirt. I watched a youtube video. mine didnt remove dirt like his. still worth the purchase though. still glad i got it. so I give it a 3. we will see how often it gets used.",

                "reviewText": "I bought my first steamer in February 2019 so it was well past the warranty when I discovered that I had lost the safety valve. After a few emails back and forth trying to find out if I could buy the missing part, customer service told me parts were not available but that they would refund me 20% on a new unit. It wasn't their fault that I lost the cap and they certainly didn't have to reimburse me 20% on a new steamer. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend their products...it's a great little steamer with a nice long cord.",
