                "reviewText": "UPDATE: when I first got this occasionally it would spit a little bit of brown out. I thought this was maybe just residue left over from manufacturer. Recently, I've had to steam a number of reenactment dresses. Suddenly the thing is spitting Brown constantly. We have a whole home water filtration system and all my other electronics have no issue. It's the consistency of syrup and the color of molasses.In desperation I ran it through with a white vinegar and water mixture as you would a coffee maker. It appeared to work well for the next few dresses. Then, it's spitting Brown again. So I attempted that again hopefully just to get through this event. Did not work at all. I even used a needle to get what looked like brown residue out of the holes before I started again. I'm having to hand wash massive ball gowns in the tub where it spit this brown all over them. It's infuriating!I've never owned a steamer before, but I absolutely love this one! I didn't think the ability to hold it horizontal instead of just vertical was important until I used it on a massive tulle skirts. What was needed to get the wrinkles out of it was actually to lay it on the ironing board and use the steamer like an iron. You can't actually iron it but using the steam vertically with a slight pressure worked like magic. It was difficult to get a picture though.Though not tiny, it is easy to pack and travels well. On a regular cotton button-up dress shirt it doesn't work as well as an iron, but it does a great job on polos, polyester Blends, and t-shirts. I've attached pictures where I've done half of the shirt in about 10 to 15 seconds. They were accidentally left in the dryer, then put in a laundry basket with weight piled on top of it. The wrinkles were quite set.Do be careful though, part of the magic of this is an extremely hot Steam. The top of the head will get warm, of course the plate the steam comes out of will burn you, and the steam itself can burn you even from several inches away.Would buy again in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewTitle": "I might never buy a cloth iron again",
                "reviewText": "All my life I only had cloth irons and hated using them. It's heavy, cumbersome. When I was a student I couldn't even fit an ironing table in my little room so I had to use my desktop instead which I had to first declot and clean.... Then irons are affordable, but low grade ones are heavy, last not long, take ages to heat up, are messy, .... You can get better experience with irons but only if you spend a few bucks.Now I have this Garment Steamer. How does it compare to an iron?I didn't expect it to be as powerful as an iron can be, or rather: you can brute force the hardest folds with an iron if you have a sturdy table and put all your weight into it, and you can't do that with a garment steamer.But still to my surprise, it does work good enough on my thick jeans, and it is going through most of my clothes like a penguin sliding on ice. The only real downside might be that you can't do seams as tightly as an iron, but that might also be my lack of experience with it.But the absolute winners here are the ease of use, the speed, and the space-saving. It takes about the same place as an iron, but you don't need a table, you can use it right on the cloth hanging from anywhere (even your hand, though be careful not to burn yourself), or laying on any random surface that won't suffer from hot water like a bed or a door. I literally steamed my entire day's clothing while waiting for my coffee machine to brew a cup, how can you beat that? If I had an iron, that would have been barely enough time just to deploy the ironing table and heat up the iron.I just steamed two of my thickest shirt for reference in the photos.A few notes though about the delivery: as you can see in the photos, the box was quite damaged. It was packed in a simple glued plastic bag with no protection. That is good enough to anonymize the content of the package, but it isn't enough of a protection.Also, the delivery happened 8 days before the announced day. I am not going to complain about a delivery being faster than anticipated, but the issue here is that I wasn't warned about it, so I wasn't available on time for when the package was dropped, and so it was just left at my door which is right on the street. Anyone could have stolen it just walking by.",

Saca buen vapor lo he usado con diferentes tipos de telas suaves y mezclilla y me ha funcionado excelente ya que quita las arrugas muy bien. Tiene algunos detalles que no me gustaron como que se repente al iniciar el vapor suele dejar manchas de agua, a parte no se apaga solo a\u00fan con el agua m\u00ednima, tambi\u00e9n el agua se acaba muy r\u00e1pido, solo he podido usarlo con maximo 3 prendas, o incluso con una se gasta m\u00e1s de la mitad del agua. No me lleg\u00f3 el accesorio de la manta 2 en 1 que mencionaba. Una ventaja es que trae un bot\u00f3n que detiene el vapor y aunque no se puede regular la potencia si ayuda a que cuando no se use se pare el vapor sin necesidad de apagarlo completamente. En general es buen producto.",
