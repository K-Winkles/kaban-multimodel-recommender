I put in a request for a return and they sent me a message on things to try before I tried to return it. I really love the look of the machine and obviously the price point is awesome so I really wanted this to work! I tried it exactly what they said and now it works perfectly! I guess when you get the machine sometimes it beeps non-stop while it's because when you put the distilled water in its not detecting the water because the water so pure it needs to be able to detect the electrolytes in the water so when you first get it you need to put tap water with a little bit of salt in it, not every time but for the first few times since it's new. After I did that my machine works beautifully! the design is awesome and it's quiet I definitely recommend this machine especially at its price point!",

                "reviewText": "The product wasn't very sturdy to start with, the base is wobbly. Also didn't like that it doesn't steam most of the water out. I get a max of 9 mins. Lastly, the machine was plugged in but the power was off and all of a sudden I smelled burning and saw smoke coming from the unit. The heating element turned very bright red and flames sparked. I'm so glad this happened while I was at my business or else there would have been a terrible fire. Do not buy!",

Poorly packaged and all metal parts are dented and one important screw is missing, without this your are not able to assemble and it means you have useless steamer.",
