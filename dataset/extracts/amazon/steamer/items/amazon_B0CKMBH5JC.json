                "reviewText": "I took before (left) and after (right) pictures of two very different materials. The first is a nylon/polyester blend. It didn't get too wrinkled, but it did clearly look wrinkled. Within about 45 seconds, the steamer got rid of the wrinkles. I didn't even use the whole container of water either! It's a hoodie, so it's not exactly small or thin, but it's a fairly easy material to get out wrinkles. The second set of pictures is a thick sweater. It can't be put in the dryer, so I usually have to iron it before wearing it again and I have to be very careful. This is a bit more dramatic. I did use most of the water this time and it took about 120 seconds to do the whole thing, but wow! No wrinkles and I could do it all while it was it on the hangar.The steamer comes with a bag and it has a velcro tie so you can easily wrap up the cord when you're done. It's compact when folded and takes up about the same amount of space as a hair dryer. It works so well and what I really love is that you don't need an ironing board! I haven't tried to make any creases in pants, so I have no idea if this would work for that, but for everything else this is great! It would travel well and for quick touch ups nothing is easier. I also tried it on velvet and silk and both came out really well so even on delicate materials this works perfectly. Thick or thin, this steamer does the trick and it's so easy to use!",

However, if you don't, what are you going to do? Bring an iron with you everywhere you go? Sounds a bit excessive. This product offers you a great solution in order to be able to travel and bring your own equipment to take care of your clothes. This Steamer compacts down into an extremely small size and is perfectly capable of making your clothes look like they just came from the drycleaners! I ordered it specifically for ironing photography backdrops while on site doing pictures, but it works just as well for clothes as it does for backdrops. I used to travel a lot and wish I had know about this, earlier! I highly recommend getting this steamer, especially if you travel a lot! It is a great tool!",

Meaning it might take longer to work with but for the sake of being able to fit it into a suitcase, I was willing. What I actually got a was pretty good steamer.It is portable in that it folds up to about roughly the size of a hardback book I would say just a bit thicker. This isn't something I would fit into my purse of course, but it still fits nicely into my suitcase with room to spare.The device comes with clear instructions and lots of warning labels to make sure you don't use the wrong voltage. It does state several times over that there might be some leftover moisture from product testing. My device was one of those. It wasn't much but a few droplets. I was a little concerned but then again it is nice to know someone tested to make sure the item was usable.The actual use of it was pleasant. I put in some distilled water and followed the simple instructions to let it heat. 20 - 30 seconds I would say. I took longer picking which shirt to test it on. The steaming took a few minutes as I got used to how the device worked. I think I need to do a few more passes, but overall I'm very pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "I steamed three items for comparison. A single curtain panel measuring 38\" x 84\" in cotton/polyester. One linen blouse. One rayon dress. I refilled the container once and had water remaining. The item that took the most time was the linen blouse. I had to hold the fabric taunt and move the steamer slower. If I wanted a crisp linen look, I would have pre-sprayed it with water, but I didn\u2019t do that to show you unadulterated results. I don\u2019t have an iron or space for an ironing board, which is why I chose the route of a hand-held steamer. The Diafield steamer heats up in under 30 seconds. I am impressed with this handheld steamer!",

It is quick to heat up and does an impressive job at getting the wrinkles out. I\u2019ve used it on several different fabrics and have yet to be disappointed. The tank is much easier to fill than other streamers I\u2019ve used. If you are in the market for a streamer, I\u2019d highly recommend purchasing this one.",

It took less than a minute for it to warm up to be ready to use. It was extremely easy to get started and use. I like that it is foldable for easy storage and doesn't take up too much room. Don't have to worry about the iron being too hot and ruining your clothes. This thing works quickly and gets the wrinkles out!",
