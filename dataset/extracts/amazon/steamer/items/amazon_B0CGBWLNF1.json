The steamer comes in 2 parts the body and the attachment capsule for water. The handle folds for storage and unfolds for use. There's the power button and a light indicator that it's on. It starts steaming almost immediately upon powering on. There's no dripping of water as the capsule is well secured. It's powerful and has worked on every fabric I've used it on. And yes, it can work on pants too but I just like my pants with creases. Oh and it's absolutely awesome for linen and satin fabrics. I've evenbused it on fur and faux fur products. It's also great for fabrics with prints or graphics on them as it doesn't burn or smear them. I've also traveled with it which is awesome and it takes up very little space and its light. Just an amazing product this steamer.",

                "reviewText": "I prefer to steam my clothes because ironing takes too long and doesn\u2019t really produce much better results. I previously used a little no-name travel steamer, so this Phillips steamer is quite an upgrade. I was really impressed by how quickly it heats up- within 30 seconds, it produces hot and effective steam to attack the wrinkles in my clothes. Unlike my old steamer, this has a little trigger to release the steam is burst as I need it. The result is that I use less water, and the room doesn\u2019t get all steamy and hot from having a constant stream of steam coming out. The wrinkles in my clothes release almost instantly when the steam hits them, and clothes look fresh and sharp. I love that I can easily use this for a quick touch when I get my clothes ready the night before, or even when I\u2019m getting ready. I don\u2019t plan on traveling with mine, but it folds up very compact and can be taken on the road if necessary. This product is a must for people that hate to iron their clothes!",

                "reviewText": "I have never been a big fan of irons and ironing boards, so a steamer seemed like a better an safer alternative for our needs.I love that this is compact and portable so it is easy to put in a suitcase for a road trip when your clothes need refreshing. It also removes bacteria - which is a bonus when it comes to bedding and seating.We have 2 dogs in our home so it can be hard to keep things looking and feeling fresh. This steamer is a fast solution to fix wrinkles and refresh fabrics.Since this only uses water, it is safe to use on pretty much every type of fabric. The instructions do recommend using distilled water though - since water can sometimes be hard or carry impurities.The cord is a little limited if you are trying to cover large surfaces and it won't do as permanent a press as an iron can. But for the convenience factor alone I do recommend it.It heats up fast and does the job well and will definitely improve the appearance of anything you use it on.",
