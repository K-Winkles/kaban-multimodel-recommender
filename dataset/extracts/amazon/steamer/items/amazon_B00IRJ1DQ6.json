        "description": "Discovering a green way to clean Clean and sanitize when used as directed in one easy step. Steam is an all-natural cleaner that can sanitize when used as directed, clear sticky spots and eliminate dirt\u2013all without the use of harsh chemicals. Steaming is safe on virtually all sealed hard surfaces including: ceramic, vinyl, laminate, granite, marble and sealed hard wood. Drying takes just seconds, so it\u2019s easy to clean anytime, anywhere. From showers and windows to counters and floors, there isn\u2019t a surface that can\u2019t be cleaned with steam. For tackling tough grime on above floor surfaces, we recommend a hand-held steam cleaner or the BISSELL Lift-Off Steam Mop for the job.",
