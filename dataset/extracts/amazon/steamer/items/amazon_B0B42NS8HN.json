The company selling this product will reach out before you even get it in the mail to send you helpful tips and documentation. I give an A+ effort on their part. They sent me a couple of emails right after purchase and right after it arrived in the mail.It took me a month or so before I finally unboxed this item to try it out and now the return window has closed, but if I could return it, I would. It didn\u2019t do much. I was so excited to try to steam the grout between the tiles in my shower or the caulk lining at the bottom edges of the shower, or even just the shower floor itself. I was thinking finally, I will get some of these spots looking brighter and whiter and restored. I tried and tried. I even added detergent to the water. Nothing worked. Nothing became cleaner than it was before.So like my title of this review says, I\u2019m not sure what this is meant to clean. Maybe it would be easier to clean surfaces like floors or something? I have no idea. But that would take a lot of time to clean a floor with this.I hope this review helps someone. I am simply speaking the story that happened for me. This product probably does work for other purposes, but I specifically bought it to use for cleaning the bathroom and I had difficulties.",

We all have knick knacks sitting around our homes and eventually they collect dust. A short spray of stream and a soft cloth makes such a difference.

I wrote the seller and got the response that if I left a 5 star review, sent them a screen shot of it THEN they'd give me a 24 month warranty. I told them that I review as I see fit and cannot be bought. I probably would have given this at least 4 stars except for the con on the warranty. I've only used it once but it put out a LOT of steam and did a good job.I had a little trouble putting the cap back on after filling. I'm not sure if the threads are a hair off or if it was me. The other problem is that is is poorly balanced and very easily tips over. You have to be very careful with the attachments (I used long hose). If it isn't on exactly right and locked...which I thought it was...it pops off. I can live with these issues.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this steamer for one main big issue at our seasonal home. We purchased this condo which was about 7 years old. One of the showers has bone coloured tiles and grout that was stained very badly with hard water stains and the glass door was totally covered from top to bottom with hard water stains and scale,that seemed an impossible thought it could be cleaned. I heard reviews of these steam cleaners, did some research on Amazon and due to the many positive reviews and the excellent price I decided to give this one a try. Well it took awhile to arrive to me due to a secondary transport company, but when I got it I went to town in the kitchen, the toilets everything and I was very impressed. Time to tackle the shower. I still was unsure of what would happen, so started with the tiles and grout. It did take awhile to get it clean. I used one of the included hard brushes and after an hour and a half the tiles were totally like new. All the discolorization had disappeared. It was a hard job, but it worked. I decided to tackle the glass door the next day. I got set up with the bristle brush and started in. Believe me I worked hard. I had to go little by little but after 2 hours, the entire door was completely clear of the hard scale. I was just so happy. I decided a week later I would do our floor to ceiling lined drapes. I got ready to go, plugged in the machine and nothing. The light did not come on...I moved to another plug, nothing. Got my manual out to troubleshoot, nothing. I got back on Amazon and looked though the screens and screens of reviews and found a couple of people with the same thing. I was upset because of where we are located with a return or resend but it was only used a few times and thought I would contact the seller. I managed to get a person at Amazon that got me set up to send a message to the seller. He answered by the next day and sent me out a replacement. What excellent customer service!! So my new one arrived to me a few weeks later, and today I fired it up. Redid the toilets, sinks, shower and one set of drapes. The drapes look great, I will tackle the rest this week. I hope I just had a lemon, and this little work hose will keep going. I plan on buying another one for our home when we leave here in 2 months. I will update this if anything changes. If you are thinking of getting a steamer, do it. Just makes you feel good having everything cleaned so well.",

Not\u00e9 que del dep\u00f3sito de l\u00edquido de limpieza nunca lo expuls\u00f3, solo sal\u00eda vapor pero no el l\u00edquido de limpieza por lo que el dep\u00f3sito al finalizar qued\u00f3 lleno de este l\u00edquido.Tiene el inconveniente que aunque el vapor calienta casi de inmediato, \u00e9ste se termina en muy pocos minutos, casi 5 minutos en cada llenado de agua en el dep\u00f3sito, despu\u00e9s hay que esperar aproximadamente 10 a 15 minutos para que enfr\u00ede y volver a depositar agua dentro de \u00e9l; esto quita mucho tiempo de espera para poder volver a iniciar el proceso de limpieza. Despu\u00e9s de horas de intentar, aproximadamente 6 horas, ya decepcionado y cansado, opt\u00e9 mejor por limpiar las superficies descritas anteriormente de manera convencional, con un cepillo en mano, no los del limpiador comprado. Ya sin usar el aparato limpiador, cepillando con mi mano, limpiando con otras toallas y usando un producto l\u00edquido de limpieza y en tan solo 40 minutos logr\u00e9 limpiar todas las superficies que hab\u00eda intentado hacerlo con el aparato limpiador de vapor comprado el cual no funcion\u00f3 para nada.S\u00f3lo gast\u00e9 in\u00fatilmente al comprarlo y aunque busque la firma de c\u00f3mo regresarlo a la tienda, no encontr\u00e9 la forma de hacerlo, as\u00ed es que no me queda otra que quedarme con el limpiador de vapor como un recuerdo de una compra in\u00fatil.En verdad, no lo recomiendo para nada, no funciona para lo que describe. \ud83d\ude25",
