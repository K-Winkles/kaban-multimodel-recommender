                "reviewText": "I was looking to replace a Conair handheld steamer that didn\u2019t get wrinkles out as much as it boasted for its 1875watts of power. I spent some time looking at some handheld steamers and after some consideration I chose this Ticwell steamer. Glad I got it! Out of the box, it was easy to remove the water tank, fill it with water, reattach it, and turn on the steamer. After about 30 seconds it was ready to go. I chose to steam a coat I just bought from Amazon. And you know that it came vacuum sealed so the coat was super creased and wrinkly. This steamer effortlessly got those creases and wrinkles out! What would have taken me 10 minutes took me 5 minutes to wrinkle-free wear. I took out some blazers that I had washed and hung dry and needed to get pressed. I used the steamer on them and because of the poly blend material determined how long you needed to spend on getting wrinkles out with this steamer.What I do love about this steamer is that it has a flat head surface with a metal plate that acts like the hot surface of an iron. Hold it against the clothing you are steaming and it acts like an iron and steams those wrinkles away. Since it doesn\u2019t have a setting for different types of fabrics like an iron does, you might have to spend more time running the steamer head but still the time it took with my old Conair handheld I was so excited. I ran out of things to steam lol so I jumped online to write this review.",

                "reviewText": "Why did I wait so long to get a clothes steamer?! This travel steamer is awesome! I bought this for our recent vacation but didn\u2019t realize the cruise ship doesn\u2019t allow them. Bummer! It steams well and heats up quickly. I didn\u2019t experience much if any spitting from the steamer and it was able to take care of all my wrinkled clothes I could throw at it. I used it so much that my husband bought me a full size one! As it is a travel one I was having to refill the water tank frequently. But again that is no fault of the steamer. It\u2019s very easy to use and I like the self clean option it has. Just make sure to use distilled water for best results and longevity of the steamer. Overall I love it and when I can take it with me I will!",

I might have gotten a faulty one and the customer service through Amazon messages was excellentThe steamer worked great the first time but stopped working after that. I contacted the customer (who can only be reached via email) and no response despite the advertisement of a 2 yr warranty. It became faulty within a month and after only one use.",

                "reviewText": "Real person here to give you the scoop on this item that I did not get for free or even at a discount. I wish.Reviewer ashwilu94 sold me with her video and I\u2019m so glad she did. I could go on and on, but the important thing to know is this thing melts wrinkles like butter. I ordered it when I bought eight 96 inch curtain panels. I anticipated lots of stubborn wrinkles, and got lots of wrinkles, but they weren\u2019t so stubborn with this tool. It even melted those hard creases that come from wrapping the curtain panels around a piece of cardboard. I didn\u2019t spend more than five minutes on any one of these panels, and some of them were incredibly wrinkled. This steamer even flattened out the puckering on the edge seams of the curtain panels. It was like I ironed them, but better. I have to say I\u2019m not too thrilled that I paid full price and now the steamer is on sale with substantial savings. Still, this thing is fabulous. I found myself looking around the house for wrinkles to destroy. I did struggle a bit with putting the water tank onto the top piece until I realized that I had to put them at a 90\u00b0 angle and then twist. I\u2019ve had no problems with mine and based on that, I would definitely recommend this all day long.",

Very easy to use. Once I fill the bottom with water it provides me enough steam to straighten 10 shirts with 15 minutes of continuous steam. Compatible with any material so I use it on everything. It only takes seconds to pre heat and no water never leaks. It came with 2 fabric brushes to help remove wrinkles, lint balls, and dirt. I like to use it right before I step out and it never leaves any water marks.",
