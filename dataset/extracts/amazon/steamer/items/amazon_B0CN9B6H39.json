                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been telling myself for years that I need a handheld steamer/iron; but there always seemed to be something I felt I needed more, at the time. This past week, I bought a new shower curtain for my guest bath. I\u2019ve had the old shower curtain for almost 5 years, and it still shows all the creases it had straight out of the package, even after repeated washings. This time, I knew I had to pull the trigger and get a handheld steamer. This steamer does everything it\u2019s supposed to do. It is small, but mighty, with a long cord - I appreciate that it\u2019s not a rechargeable device, as so many things seem to be. And it\u2019s easy to use. Unlock the top, to remove it, revealing the water cup. Fill it with water to the Max line, replace the top, locking it on. Turn the device on with a flip of the power switch, and wait about 2 minutes. This one seemed to be boiling at just over the 1 minute mark. When the water boiled, it did start to spit and splutter a bit, but after a few seconds it settled down, and steam began to come out of the nozzle. I simply picked it up, and began moving it up and down on my hanging shower curtain, concentrating on the fold lines. It took me a few minutes to figure out a good rhythm, and how close to the fabric I could hold the steamer (hold it directly on the fabric, if it\u2019s something like a shower curtain). I got interrupted about halfway through, so just turned the steamer off and set it on my bathroom counter. When I got back to it, it was cool enough that I could remove the top and check the water. It was almost empty, so I filled it again, and began steaming as soon as it was warmed up. I completed the whole shower curtain, and I\u2019m so pleased with it\u2019s seamless appearance. Sadly, I forgot to get before pictures, but you can see how nicely it falls, without fold lines, in the attached photo. It\u2019s beautiful! This is the year I\u2019m finally going to hang semi-sheer curtains on two large windows. I\u2019m not even dreading it, because I know I can steam them when they\u2019re hung, rather than trying to iron them, which never works well. I know I\u2019ll be using this little steamer enough to regret that I didn\u2019t get it years ago. At $22.99, as of this writing, I feel this is a good value, especially considering how much time and effort it\u2019s going to save me. Small but mighty handheld steamer - I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I got this steamer to remove a few wrinkles from a couple different sets of curtains that I already have hanging. The thinner the fabric, of course the easier the wrinkles fall out when steaming. It does a good job as long as you hold it right up really close to the fabric of whatever you are steaming. It took out every wrinkle and one of the curtains was more of a drape like thicker material. It will run for about ten minutes. It starts steaming within the first two minutes and then steams for 8 minutes. I put only reverse osmosis water in it. I think this steamer is a good value. It doesn't weight much and is easy to use. It also has a very long electric cord. It is kind of hard to see the max water line unless you are in a very well lit area. You don't want to overfill it. I really do like it and I will be getting a lot of use out of it. I recommend this economical steamer.",

The head is shaped the correct way to spread the steam in a nice thin line. It does a great job of steaming and clears wrinkles quickly.We're using these on the road and on future trips.

Worked great on our curtains as well as clothes.The extra long (8ft) cord allows for a lot of movement.Just a word of caution:the steam is VERY hot, as the warning shows, so watch your hands and young children nearby.Also make sure to use distilled water for longevity of the steamerMost tap water contain too much mineralsWould highly recommend this Becoolpet steamer.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this steamer! Lightweight, super simple to use, quick and efficient. I love the versatility this small size provides. I can put it in my suitcase when I travel, add it to my overnight bag, and use it in the mornings to remove wrinkles on my work clothes. I like that the lock/unlock safety feature for the top portion is easily visible. The steam nozzle is not too big and makes it easy to cover a good amount of fabric. The opening to add water is good sized, and I really like that I can clearly see how much water is in it. Once you turn it on the water heats quickly and you can see it boiling. In no time the steam is already coming out! I was able to iron 3 costume dresses on one tank of water. The one in the video is polyester, I also tried it on broad cloth material which took a few more passes but easily removed all the wrinkles. We are only allowed to load one video, so wasn't able to show the different material types. I found it to be packaged well, instructions easy to follow, and appreciated the safety information. This is definitely a winner!",

I tried this on 3 different fabrics, cotton, polyester, & linen. The wrinkles didn\u2019t come out of any of them. It does heat very quickly, as advertised though. It was definitely under 1 minute from power to full steam. I\u2019ll give them that. It\u2019s also a conveniently small size, making it great for travel. If you want it for something other than removing wrinkles from your clothes, you may love it. I don\u2019t find any other purpose for it, though. It just doesn\u2019t fulfill its purpose.",
