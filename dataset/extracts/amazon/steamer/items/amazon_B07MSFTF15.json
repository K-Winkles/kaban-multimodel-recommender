When using the steamer for the floors, the attached pad helps the mop move and glide nicely over the bathroom floor. I've even used this on our hardwood floor to remove dirt and dog paw prints. Does an amazing job!!Easy to take apart and use as a handheld steamer for cleaning and disinfecting toilets, sinks, showers, pretty much anything you need to clean.",

I use to use clorox bleach to clear these floors and I had to use a lot to get then clean. That cause breathing issues, but this steamer !! Oh my goodness. It Cleans! I gave it 4 and half because the brush on one clean kinda... wore out. I didn't use pressure so that was odd. I also wish the mop was Interchangeable with their other wider mop style.I will eventually get it. I highly recommend this product.",

Also, love the fact that it disinfects with the steam.",

                "reviewText": "My entire house is wood floors so I purchased thinking it would make cleaning a breeze. Well, there's a couple of things wrong with the how it operates. 1, there is no on or off switch. You have to unplug it/out each time. That in itself sucks because if you're cleaning floors in one room and the outlet you plugged into is on the other side of the room, you're screwed, you have to walk across clean steamed floors to unplug it. 2, The push spray button doesn't work after 4 uses.",

And the pads that comes with it, does not clean well at all. I loved the idea of cleaner in head. With foot pump.They should make it rectangle head with steam holes all over to the edges of the pad. Helps with cleaning to the edges And keep that cleaner filler head idea. That would be perfect. It seemed well made.But I clean houses and offices. And this did not work for my needs.I have a shark mop from like 14 years ago. And it's just starting to mess up. I'm looking for it's replacement before it completely dies.Always use filtered water. Or you'll continously plug it up. Cause tap water has minerals. Don't care what steam cleaner it is. Good luck",
