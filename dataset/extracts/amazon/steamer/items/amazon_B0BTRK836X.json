It puts out a decent volume of steam and has my shirts and pants wrinkle-free in a short time. The unit itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold in one hand for a while, without wearing my arm out.I just need to remember to use distilled water, so I don't clog it up and break it, like my last steamer. The on/off button starts out red and changes to green when it is ready to steam. The cord is long and does not get in the way when I am using it. So far, I have used the steamer several times and it has quickly done the job well each time. I have also used it on table runners and new kitchen curtains. This is a handy little steamer.",

And from what I have seen so far, this steamer fits my needs perfectly well!To be sure, this is not a super high end steamer, and you do need to hold the steamer REALLY close, if not directly on the garment, to have it work well, because the flow of steam is not particularly powerful, but it works, and it is quite portable and easy to use.I would highly suggest using distilled water in the steamer, which I'd recommend for any steamer or iron.Given the price and performance of this steamer, I think it is a great choice. I would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a big improvement ergonomically over other steamers I've used, most of which were owned by women and were smaller than this one. This is more like the kind they use in stores at night to bring order to piles of rumpled jackets, and has a design that most men would be comfortable with--not too long ago, most men wouldn't have even known what a steamer was. I've wanted one for a long time, since ironing takes a lot more trouble, and steaming is best for suit coats and ties. I tried it out on a tropical shirt that still had the packaging folds, and it not only took a tenth of the time it would take to set up the board and iron it, the shirt looks better than if it were ironed, which tends to bring up detailing from the other side or from the inside of a garment, getting worse each time. It was very easy to use, and I appreciate the sturdiness and the design of the steamhead. It only takes about forty-five seconds to heat the water, and the tank detaches for filling. It will be really nice for my draperies, which are mostly fairly heavy and hold wrinkles.I'm sold on this thing. I'm waiting for them to design one that I can use on my face, which may require backengineered alien technology, given the inherent obstacles. But for clothes, this one is just fine!",
