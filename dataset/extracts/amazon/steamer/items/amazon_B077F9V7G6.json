                "reviewText": "This is a very nice unit and replaced a SteamFast steamer we had for years. First off, let me go over the assembly and build quality.The assembly is almost straight forward, although instructions are a bit cryptic and the illustration is so small it's almost useless. Insert the pole into the opening on the steamer. I advise in fully extending it first (It's a three section pole) and then attach the hanger assembly. To do so requires an adapter to be installed over the pole like a cap, and the steam wand holder assembly then simply slips on to the adapter. The hanger assembly is then fitted together and clipped on to the steam wand holder assembly. To attach the hose, you must align the arrow with the slot on the side of the steam port, although I found nowhere it states to do so. The hose does not screw on like most steamers; it is pressed on with a quarter turn twist to the right to lock in place. Be aware the hose will be stiff (it does have a spiral metal piece at the bottom to prevent crushing) and will soften up as it gets warm. It does go back to being still when cold, as all steamers with heavy duty hoses do.Okay, we are done with assembly and you can figure out the creaser clip and brush that attach to the steam wand head. Fill the container with distilled water, plug it in, press the on switch and then wait. Yes, about a minute for steam and there will be plenty of it. I suggest you start on high and then move toward low as you decide what steam you need. The unit will occasionally gurgle on low but that is entirely normal. IF the hose is extended upright as it should be, the excess steam/water will settle back down with no drops or spurts.The hanger assembly is adjustable for larger garments and does have a pants hanger so that is a plus.In summary, it is an good steamer, with lots of steam that works well.Update: The seller has outstanding customer service and replaced the original unit that had marginal steam at best. Several e-mails and they sent a new unit that works exactly as advertised. I believe there was some issue with the steam selector dial, not providing steam selection on that unit. Normally I would give this 4 stars but with customer service like this, 5 stars is well warranted. Peace of mind knowing a seller stands behind their product so well.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't really have high hopes after having received and returned another brand that had pretty good ratings. This was recommended on another site so I figured with the free return option it was worth another try for a standing steamer. I am so glad I did because it works fantastic! I tried it out as soon as it came with an incredibly wrinkled dress and it was wrinkle free in under 3 minutes. Will it last? Only time will tell but I bought the extended warranty just to make sure. It doesn't take up much room, heats up fast, didn't leak and made quick work of wrinkles on a linen-like jacket. So far a definite winner.PS The garment hangar is adjustable in width. For the complaints that it is too small be sure you pull both ends out to expand it to its fullest width.",

                "reviewText": "This product definitely has it\u2019s pros and cons. To start with I have to say I really like the fact that the actual steamer is not heavy making it easy to carry if you wish to transport easier than rolling.I also like the fact that it is a quiet steamer, and the instructions clearly state that if you start to hear a gurgling you just straighten the hose and it stops - this actually works.The on/off button is easily accessible with your foot.The things I do not like about it are the following:The plastic are clearly not high grade. The hanger is flimsy and easily comes off and its a bit difficult to turn over and renegade if you want to steam the back. So, I found that for me it is easier to just leave the plastic hanger in place and have the garment on actual hanger and that way I can move around and turn to the back side with ease.The hose gets pretty hot so you have to be extremely careful to only handle the steamer and obviously towards the bottom so as to not get burnt from the steam.It took longer than 45 seconds to heat up and once it did the only really effective setting is on high even though it shows that cotton is best on a lower setting.Overall the product works well, and if you do not necessarily need a professional steamer this could be for you - it could use though some improvements.",

                "reviewText": "I typically use a standing steamer such as this one daily for my clothes and for a while this one functioned well. This is actually my second purchase through Amazon of almost the exact same standing steamer from Pursteam and although they were both rated very well, each of them failed within two years even though I only used filtered water inside both units.This particular unit failed pretty early on starting with the problem that the water easily overflows out of the reservoir so you constantly have to keep a towel underneath it to keep the water from ruining your floor.Only about 1.5 years into owning the steamer, I started to have problems with it only wanting to steam about half the time or if it did work it would take long breaks when turned on and you\u2019d have to wait about 30 seconds or more for the steam to kick back in. Not long after that, it stopped working all together and I even did some of the things that they recommend that you do like soaking the internals with vinegar just in case there\u2019s any buildup and nothing worked.I also reached out directly through Amazon as well as Pursteam since it really wasn\u2019t that old and I got zero customer service or any help with replacement at all. Next time around I\u2019m certainly going to choose a different brand because after two times I certainly don\u2019t trust any of the reviews unfortunately.",
