                "reviewText": "Been using this and I gotta say that I like this design of handheld steamers better. They used to have the other older portable steamers that you couldn't lay horizontally and were worse in quality I felt like. This class of steamer is nice and sturdier to use it feels like and can use horizontally. It didn't have any leak yet for me, I know that is often an issue with steamers. I like the ease of use and portability aspect of it. It's not the strongest steamer in the world but it also isn't hundreds of dollar and is a portable nice steamer that gets the job done for up to medium wrinkled clothes, in my personal experience. I would recommend!",

I do have a standard floor model steamer, which I love and use quite often, so I wanted to try this handheld one for curtains, as with a floor model, you can only reach so high and I like to steam my curtains to freshen them up, get rid of dust mites. It's definitely worth having around. Easy to carry wherever, plug it in and you're ready to steam. I did add a short extension cord. I'm very happy with this product.",

I love this steamer!When I ordered this, I had every intention of gifting it to someone for Christmas. After I read some of the reviews, I decided to try it. After I tested it, I was blown away by how easy it is to use and how well it works!Years ago, I purchased a steamer from one of the shopping shows on TV. It was not easy to use, and it did not remove wrinkles, so I gifted it to someone in a work gift exchange. I'm sure you see a pattern here.I decided to get the steamer out tonight and give it a whirl. The first item was my work slacks, which had been worn once and had some wrinkles from sitting at the desk all day. Normally, I'd get the iron and the ironing board out to freshen them up. The YIKA Steamer is so much easier and faster. The slacks were steamed and ready for work. Next, I tackled a sweater I'd left in the bottom of my tote; it was a wrinkled mess, and frankly, I didn't have much faith that I could get this ready to wear again. With a few swipes of the YIKA Steamer, it was ready for the office. I love this steamer!Highly recommend.",
