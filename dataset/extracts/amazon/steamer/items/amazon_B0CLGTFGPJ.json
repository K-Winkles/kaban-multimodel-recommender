Our steam cleaner is designed for safe and effective cleaning with an internal temperature of 230\u00b0F (110\u00b0C) and steam between 212\u00b0F and 221\u00b0F (100-105\u00b0C). Cleaning at this optimal temperature ensures both stain removal and personal safety. Why can't I open the safety cap if I want to refill it after use? Because there is high pressure in the water tank. It is recommended to cool down for 3-5 minutes after use and open the safety cap after the pressure in the tank has been released, and only after that can the tank be refilled with water. How effective is a steamer for cleaning grout and tile? It works well for grout and tile. The attachment comes with 2 nylon brush heads that are perfect for cleaning a variety of crevices. What is included inside the package? If you look at the pictures and description, you'll know that it includes the steamer along with 10 attachments for cleaning, and it helps with all-around home cleaning.

                "reviewText": "I bought this steam cleaner in hopes it would be helpful in removing years worth of grease/crud build up off of my gas stove metal grates. Mind you, this was after multiple attempts to clean it with other methods that usually work, such as soaking the grates in hot water & whatever cleaning agent followed by a good sesh of hard scrubbing with wire brushes.Although that method worked a bit, the result was always the same.Some of the grease build up would come off but that sticky, gross crud resembling the remnants of adhesive would hang on for dear life and I\u2019d be sitting there feeling like I just wasted hours of my day I\u2019d never get back.Well I\u2019ll be damned! This steam cleaner has been a life saver!!! It\u2019s easy to use AND works like a charm. I went from hand scrubbing all sorts of kitchen items which took me hours to steam cleaning everything within minutes. So yes, WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!With that being said, there are a few things to keep in mind:1)READ THE USER MANUAL BEFORE USING IT.2)Definitely use the water filling cup it comes with to fill the water chamber, rather than just placing it underneath the faucet and hoping it\u2019s got enough water in there. The cup is provided for a reason :)3) It needs time to heat up prior to using it and time to cool down before refilling the water chamber, so plan accordingly.4) Wearing some sort of gloves would be a good idea so your hands don\u2019t get covered in gunk. No you don\u2019t need heavy duty gloves, but a pair of household rubber gloves one would use to wash dishes with will do.5) If you\u2019re using this to clean heavy build up of some sort, wear clothing you don\u2019t care about incase there\u2019s any unforeseen splattering. The steam cleaner itself doesn\u2019t create a massive amount of splatter, but, odds are there will be a bit of splattering when cleaning.Hope this review was helpful :)",

                "reviewText": "My experience with the STEAMIFY Pressurized Handheld Steam Cleaner was nothing short of impressive. As someone who takes pride in maintaining a clean home, this steamer has become an indispensable tool in my cleaning routine.Let me start by highlighting its versatility. With 10pcs accessories and a safety lock, this little powerhouse can tackle just about any cleaning task thrown its way. From grimy bathroom tiles to greasy kitchen surfaces, the STEAMIFY Steam Cleaner handled them all with ease. The variety of attachments made switching between tasks a breeze.What really stood out to me was the safety lock feature. As a parent, knowing that the steamer won\u2019t accidentally turn on when my kids are around is a huge relief. Plus, the ergonomic design made it comfortable to hold, even during longer cleaning sessions.In terms of performance, the STEAMIFY Steam Cleaner didn\u2019t disappoint. It blasted away dirt and grime with its powerful steam, leaving surfaces sparkling clean and sanitized. I was especially impressed by its ability to reach into tight spots and crevices that other cleaners often miss.The quick heating time and continuous steam function meant I could keep cleaning without any interruptions. However, I did find myself refilling the water reservoir more often than I\u2019d like for larger projects. And while the power cord could be longer for added convenience, it wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me.Overall, the STEAMIFY Pressurized Handheld Steam Cleaner has earned its place as a household hero in my book. Its versatility, performance, and safety features make it a must-have for anyone who takes their cleaning seriously. I can confidently say that my experience with the STEAMIFY Steam Cleaner has been nothing short of fantastic, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable cleaning solution.",
