                "reviewText": "This steamer does an excellent job. We washed 2 sets of curtains but they wrinkled and to get them pressed at a dry cleaner was more expensive than buying this machine. They were a thicker material so we used the higher setting and it did a fantastic job and we tested the lower setting on a few of my wifes blouses and sweaters and again it did a great job. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because when steaming the curtain and keeping the unit level the steam escapes downward so it burns your hand so to avoid that you have to tip the unit backwards so the steam goes up and away from your hands. Other than that it's a great unit and I highly recommend it",
