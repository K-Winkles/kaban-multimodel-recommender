        "description": "GIOVANNI Tea Tree Triple Treat Invigorating Conditioner increases scalp circulation, leaving your hair feeling refreshed and renewed with every use. GIOVANNI was the first full-range, salon-inspired hair-care brand in natural product stores, and today is the #1 selling Hair Care line in the United States Natural Products Industry. But before there was a brand, there was a pioneer. Arthur Guidotti had a vision and a love for all things hair. He began developing his passion as a hairstylist in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. By the 1960s, Arthur was maturing his talents and decided to open his own salon, called On Sunset. The salon was a bustling site, on the famous Sunset Strip, and a hit with many Hollywood celebrities, including Lucille Ball. Since 1979 the GIOVANNI Rule of Balance has been our commitment to make each product as pure and as natural as possible without sacrificing exceptional product performance. GIOVANNI is committed to creating only the highest-performance formulations, wrapped in aesthetically beautiful packaging and marketed with extraordinary visuals and graphics.",

                "reviewText": "At the risk of sounding like a broken record, if you've already read my review of Giovanni's Triple Threat shampoo, I'm truly utterly amazed with this conditioner. Besides the amazing certified organic and vegan ingredients, the fragrance, the luxurious conditioning emollients, the truly invigorating sensation my scalp receives immediately upon applying, this product along with the shampoo has completely reversed my dry scalp and dandruff. I've heard amazing things about Tea Tree oil for dandruff and dry scalp. Believe me, IT WORKS. No more synthetic chemicals. But add rosemary and peppermint to the mix and you also have the perfect conditioner to support hair growth and reduce hair loss. And it's a great detangler to boot! When you love something this much AND you can buy the gallon salon size, what could be better? Less environmental waste, too? What a perfect product! Bravo, Giovanni! Bravo!",

                "reviewText": "I use this conditioner almost as a leave in. I use Nioxin shampoo for thinning hair. But it can be a little strong so I condition with this to invigorate the scalp, do a quick rinse, but leave some in. So far it is working better than any other conditioner I have tried. One of the things I like the most is that it is light weight even tho I don\u2019t completely rinse. It is hard to get the moisture balance right between to oily & too dry, for me this does the trick. I do use a lot of it at a time, probably different for everyone.",

Yes, it's not the most conditioning/detangling, but I detangle my hair before showering. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I love it!",
