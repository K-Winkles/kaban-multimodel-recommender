Trying to find a fragrance free conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down has been difficult.This works really well - easy to work through my hair, easy to rinse out, eliminates tangles, but LORDY! The SMELL! It seriously smells like dirty feet. I have to hold my breath until I get it rinsed out.I guess this is why so many \"unscented\" products have \"masking fragrance\" in them.I'll keep buying it because it works so well, but I sure hope the next tube smells better.ETA: Just started on my second tube and I'm happy to say that this one has no odor/fragrance at all, so I felt good about adding another star.I'm just going to assume the smelly tube was from a bad batch.",

                "reviewText": "I have wavy, thick, shoulder length hair, and a very sensitive scalp. I\u2019ve tried everything from unscented, natural conditioner, bars to doctor recommended unscented Vanni cream conditioner, and felt like I was never going to find the right conditioner for me. I was never happy with any of the previous products I tried, because I felt like they did not hydrate my hair enough or would leave some weird film on my scalp or hair. I was scrolling TikTok one day and saw someone recommend this hair conditioner, so I ordered it immediately. I am so happy that this product exists! It does not irritate my sensitive scalp at all and provides just the right amount of hydration for my hair, which is low porosity by the way. I\u2019d highly recommend that you try this product if you were interested in this , I really don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed",
