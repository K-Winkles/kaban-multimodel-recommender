                "reviewText": "I am not one who washes my hair every day. It is more like once, maybe twice, a week. Every winter, I get a dry, itchy scalp, and I am constantly scratching my head to the point of dandruff or some kind of dermatitis that causes flakes in my hair. And every winter I try to find products to alleviate this issue. This year, I did a coconut oil treatment and while I waited, I went on Amazon and found this and the shampoo. After reading the reviews and doing some quick research, I decided to try it. It arrived the next evening. That was a couple of weeks ago. I have washed and conditioned my hair about three times with this product and it has made such a difference. I do not itch anymore. I am seeing less and less dandruff. The smell is a little different than I am used to, but it isn't unpleasant. Had I known about this, I would have tried it a long time ago. If you battle the same problems I do, just buy it. It's not too expensive and the relief I feel is sooo worth it!((I wrote the same review for the shampoo.))",

Not only does it leave my hair feeling incredibly soft and manageable, but it has also noticeably improved the health of my scalp. The soothing ginger formula works wonders, and I've seen a reduction in irritation and dryness.What's even better is that I found this gem at a more budget-friendly price compared to the actual Body Shop store. This makes it a win-win situation \u2013 I get to pamper my hair and scalp without breaking the bank.If you're looking for an effective and affordable solution for both your scalp and hair, \"The Body Shop Ginger Scalp Care Conditioner\" is definitely worth a try. It's a fantastic product that delivers results and savings!",
