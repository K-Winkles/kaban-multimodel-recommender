My hair tends to be quite frizzy and unmanageable at times but after using this conditioner, I let my hair air dry. Next I used the flat iron and noticed how soft, shiny and manageable my hair became. You don\u2019t need to use a lot of this conditioner just like it says on the bottle.Will definitely be purchasing again.",

A friend said my hair now looks like I just got thrown out of a fast moving convertible. My hair now looks like a smooth frizzy fright wig found on the side of the road. I play it off, saying the look is intentional. I really expected this product to do wonders, to straighten my hair and make me more attractive when I've never been any of those things. The product works! It make your hair luxurious and smooth, but it does not promise wonders. I'm deducting one star over bitterness at how the universe has cursed me with a fright wig for hair.",

This is super concentrated and I needed to use the same amount as I normally would. Also note, this stuff is extremely thick and requires a very strong squeeze to get it out. I imagine someone with arthritis, carpal tunnel, etc. would have in incredibly difficult time getting this stuff out of the bottle.",

I\u2019ve been using it for almost two months and I noticed a difference on my hair. My hair feels and looks healthier. I have thick, wavy and puffy hair. If that makes sense, my hair is wild. Latina hair! My hair is loving this , it also looks moisturize and shiny. You only need a small amount as well. I am very picky when it comes to hair products. I can happily save that I\u2019ve found my new favorite shampoo and conditioner. Super affordable so it\u2019s a win for me.",
