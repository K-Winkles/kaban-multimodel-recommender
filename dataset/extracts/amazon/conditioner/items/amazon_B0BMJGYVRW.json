I bought the shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, and the strengthening oil. The hair mask jar came with a seal across the top to help prevent any leaks in shipping. I opened it and the jar is full and new.After washing my hair even the first time, I was surprised that the hair strands felt thicker. It is impossible to grow more hair in a day obviously, but collectively my hair felt fuller. After washing with this. I put the oil on my thinning spots every night. A little goes a long way! It IS oil, and if you use too much it will leave your hair oily of course. Just use a little bit. I will try to update in 3 months and see what the results are.",

                "reviewText": "It could be stress or nutrient deficiency or age, but my hair began to fall out, especially when I shampooed it and consistently yet exponentially after conditioning with conditioner. After trying some doctor recommended treatments, as well as using mielle rosemary oil, the hair loss lessened, but was still noticeable when I shampooed it, and super excessive when I conditioned it. Everytime I conditioned my hair, my hair would fall out in greater clumps and litter the shower curtains and walls and clog the drains. I began to fear conditioning my hair. I was skeptical of how much repair a topical shampoo could do and so I bought the mielle shampoo but not the conditioner. The first time I used the mielle rosemary shampoo, the hair loss was next to none. But I paired it with a popular conditioner (not mielle) and my hair fell out in clumps again. A couple of weeks later, I decided to give the mielle conditioner a try and did so yesterday, using the mielle shampoo beforehand. And for the first time in 10 months, I did not lose a single hair in the shower. Not one. There were no hairs in my hands, none on the shower walls, none washing down the drain, absolutely no hair fell out or shedd off. I was stunned. I let the water run down my body in the shower while I stood in disbelief and inspected the shower curtains for runaway shedding...... There was none. This is my miracle. This is my story of using mielle.",
