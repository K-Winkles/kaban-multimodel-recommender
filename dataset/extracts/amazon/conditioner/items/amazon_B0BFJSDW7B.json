                "reviewText": "All around I have liked using this product. This conditioner made my hair comb through easier for sure, and gave me confidence that it is a quality product. I thought it smelled good too contrary to another review. Not sure on the long term effects yet it will have on my hair (only using it for a week) or if I will re-order given the price point, but so far so good.",

I also feel my hair is more silky and healthy. Nothing short of what I plan on using for the rest of my life. If you're looking for a conditioner, this is the one. Also, feel my hair is more full after using this...",

                "reviewText": "I have continued to buy this for my son b/c I love the natural ingredients, smell and it works great for his curly dry hair. So the actual product I'd give 5 stars and O stars for pump. They need to design a new pump top. It is VERY hard to open and sometimes doesn't. You are supposed to screw base of pump on tight to bottle, then turn the pump top counter clockwise. It's only worked 50 percent of time on purchases. So you have to pull the whole pump out when you want to use it. There's no instruction on bottle on how to open it. So you have to go to amazon site and look up product and watch video on how to open. Really hope they design new top and advertise that. Otherwise, I think we're done. Too frustrating to open.",
