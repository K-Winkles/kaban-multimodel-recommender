                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Pureology Strength Cure Conditioner has been one of my favorite hair care products for over a year now. My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it, so it tangles easily. This conditioner works great for my hair to keep it strong but soft and shiny. It smells divine and the silky consistency is unmatched. I usually separate my hair in two sections and really work this conditioner in and I also let it sit for about 5 minutes to improve the workability. I have used this in combination with the shampoo counterpart and I also use it withy our Pureology shampoos and it still works like a charm. I highly recommend adding this to your hair care routine.",

Great products from this company.",

I\u2019ve been using these products for about two years now, and I\u2019m blown away by the difference it\u2019s made. Not only is my hair softer and less frizzy, but it\u2019s also longer, thicker, and fuller than it\u2019s been in years.Every time I see my hairdresser she comments on how healthy and thick my hair has gotten\u2026 And that\u2019s how I know these products truly work!I highly recommend Pureology for those looking to repair dry, damaged or breaking hair. It is well worth the investment!",

I still have more than half the bottle left and I bought this a few months ago! The 21 benefits spray is amazing also! I love that I made the switch.",
