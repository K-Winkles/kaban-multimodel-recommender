I have gotten tired of the chemical fake smells of products like Maui and some other brands have been searching for something more natural. So, I usually just wash my hair with conditioner but most brands build up. This conditioner does not! I've been using it for about 2 months now, once a week. I maintain my hair between washes with natural oils like coconut, olive and jojoba oils and a little rosemary essential oil mixed in. I have finally found this amazing stuff that is more natural than other products out there. Not sure I will get the shampoo but I may if I feel the conditioner starts to build up but so far I don't feel the need. This conditioner does everything I need it to. It cleans well and makes my hair soft, and the smell is pleasant. Not sure about the thinning stuff I'm not really thinning out much but can't hurt to prevent it. Pura D'or is definitely my new conditioner.",

I have been using both the shampoo and the conditioner for about 4 weeks and have yet to notice any difference in my falling hair. Also, it tends to leave my hair dry. I'm not sure if it's the conditioner or the shampoo. I will continue to use what I bought but am not sure I will buy it again.",
