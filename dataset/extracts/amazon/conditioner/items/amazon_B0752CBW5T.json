If you know, you know. I got this one to use for detangling and/or when I know I'm going to be right back in the pool later, so there is really no point.It's performed better than any drugstore conditioner I've tried, and almost as good as my favorite salon brand. I actually gave up on using my salon brand entirely, since I'm basically always going right back into the water. Along with the coordinating elvive protein cream leave in and a chlorine removing shampoo, my hair is doing surprisingly well.Absolutely would recommend to anyone with damaged hair and on a budget.",

                "reviewText": "I have very dry, thick, naturally curly long hair. Has been damaged by medications etc. Tried this based on several reviews as most all other products used in past only work ok. This made a HUGE difference! Gave my hair a softer feeling, shine and ends that are really damaged and need trimming actually look better! Curls are so nice and dry same way without being weighed down by oils etc. Really helps in higher humidity to not get super frizzy as of right now. Not getting a ton of high humidity days right now but happy with current results. The scent doesn\u2019t seem overpowering. Reminds me close to a faint almond scent which doesn\u2019t last. Just feels clean and soft. Easy to comb:brush wet without damages. Great value for the price and doesn\u2019t take a large quantity of product either. Very thick and creamy so works well into the hair.",
