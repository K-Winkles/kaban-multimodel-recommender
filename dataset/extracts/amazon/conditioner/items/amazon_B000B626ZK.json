I've tried cheaper alternatives and knockoff brands, nothing compares to the real thing.It's a bit pricey, but it lasts a long time and is well worth it. Using these products in the shower before work is a great way to wake up and start your day. Using at night before bed is a great way to relax and unwind.They smell absolutely fantastic, minty fresh and clean. Leaves hair looking and feeling great and of course has the amazing cool tingle sensation, that's the best part.I usually don't like to spend extra money splurging on myself, but these are products that are well worth it and I can't live without. Definitely recommend.",

It just makes my hair feel and behave so much better but not in some unnatural way.My hair is about 2\" long. About a pea-sized portion (maybe a pea and a half) after towel drying is a perfect amount. I rub it all in, and it spreads evenly. By the time my hair is done drying, it's disappeared except for the beneficial effect. You can use more and get some hold, but that's not what I'm looking for.The scent is both mild and pleasant. I am allergic to an ingredient that is in many fragrances, but this product does not bother me at all. That's quality.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this product for years, and I love it. It works well as a body moisturizer, but I use it primarily in my hair care. I have short hair that i wear in a fohawk type of style, I use one pump, it keeps it in place well, gives it a great shine, and keeps it really soft.If you have really sensitive hair that can't be washed every day, this is also a good product for you, as it will keep your hair soft and in place for 2 days.The cons: It can be a bit on the expensive side, but the big bottle will last a while when it's used how I mentioned earlier. And the smell is just okay.Overall, I do love this product, and think it is worth the money.",
