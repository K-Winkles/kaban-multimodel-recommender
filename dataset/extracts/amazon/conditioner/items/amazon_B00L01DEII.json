                "reviewText": "I LOVE this line!!!\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b It will give you the most beautiful hair!! &&I have ordered from Amazon for the last 6years at least &it has always been consistent; REAL PRODUCTS; the real brand &high quality;; exactly what I expect EVERYtime!! Give it a try!!\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc99I\u2019ve used Biolage products since I was a child && it is always consistent quality; very gentle;; but does a fantastic job at giving you clean, soft, BEAUTIFUL hair!! && the smell is AMAZINGG!!The Biolage Line has this classic; unique scent I am obsessed with!!!\ud83d\ude3b It\u2019s also the same scent for most of the products (or just slightly different) &&it\u2019s always been THE SAME... it reminds me of being little &&my mom washing my hair with me\ud83d\ude38or doing deep condition treatments at sleepovers w/girlfriends (sorry to be so corny\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\udc99)But I just LOVE IT!! every time I use BiOlAGE; I just get this flood of pretty smell; good feelings && it just makes me happy! It\u2019s like the old Herbal Essence commercials!! \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude38 ok back to the review!!I have the MOST trouble with my hair!! I have mostly straight; fine blonde hair;; it tends to be dry &difficult.. It\u2019s VERY very fine; but I have a ton of it! So it gets super tangles &hair falls && of course by the end of the day; it\u2019s also oily/greasy at the roots already!!!Usually if my ends are soft my roots are greasy!! ORR..it will get weighed down feeling; &heap together with this sticky feeling;;; like every hair wants to grab each other at the ends.. it just won\u2019t be soft &silky unless it\u2019s JUST the right balance &&products!I also have to switch products & circulate my shamp//condish every few days; or my hair gets used to it &&it stops \u201cworking\u201d (anyone else out there?!?!!\ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b) SOO;; trust me when I say I have tried EVERY-THINGG!!! &&trust when I say I would KNOW the difference of authentic product!! In my experience you DEF DON\u2019T have to be sketched to buy off of Amazon!!I don\u2019t love any other product as much as Biolage &&Bio\u2019s \u201cHydra-source\u201d!!I have used a lot of different formulas: FiberStrong repair(6/10)(scent is\ud83d\udcaf);; the Exquisite Oil(now it\u2019s called something else?)(8/10); && the color care(9/10)(&others) but the original Hydrasource has always been my favorite! Its the most soft & SOO silky;; even after using Lanza for years! I still like it best!!I switched from the Lanza Healing Moisture//Healing Strength(in summer) to Biolage (it also helps it\u2019s literally HALFthe price! TWICE the softness &3x the scent!)The original Hydrasource is also available but I decided to give the \u201cUltra Hydra-source\u201d a try && I\u2019m super stoked I did! I LOVE IT!!!! I can\u2019t say that enough!!The formula really is different in my opinion.. it seems much \u201ccreamier\u201d in consistency; but the conditioner feels lighter;; almost like fluffy feeling when you apply.. It is silky as it rinses &&it doesn\u2019t seem to want to tangle as much!.. BUT it doesn\u2019t weigh me down like some of the more \u201cmoisture//oils\u201d shamp/condish products or like the all natural/organic products do!I have been using this steadily for about 5/6mo now &&I think I\u2019ll only get the \u201cUltra\u201dnow on!!! I normally wash my hair every day;; but I have been wash training to go down to 2-3days.. i can really tell a difference in my ends.. My roots don\u2019t get as greasy as quickly && the ends are staying soft... usually by the end of the day/day 2 I\u2019d have dry straw ends.. it\u2019s improving every day but you will see a MAJOR DIFFERENCE in ONE WASH!!!Give this a try because:(1) It does NOT weigh your hair down!!! if you have fine hair;; especially if you have lots of hair(like me) or thick hair it will keep your ends soft & hydrated feeling until the next wash!(2) I can tell the difference in ONE wash! I use other moisturizer combos but this is my favorite;; it\u2019s so silky immediately! my hair feels like silk most of the day! You can feel it even while rinsing!!(3) it\u2019s easy on sensitive skin!! My whole family uses it! My son is 8&has VERY SENSITIVE skin && he has no problem with it! I usually use all natural for him;; but tried it while we were out && it made such a difference in his tangles! He has long; fine blonde hair like me && it gets so tangled && I love this for him so much it\u2019s now what he uses!&&it smells sooooooo GOOD!!I use this on me but I mainly bought the \u201cultra rich\u201d version for my husband to try.. he always complains that nothing works for his hair.. he has very thick dark blonde hair that tends to frizz (or \u201cpuff up\u201d in his words) bc it\u2019s between waves/curly/straight.. so for years he washes 1x/week.. I told him that\u2019s gross && I\u2019d find him something that worked! This Made his hair smooth; but without being \u201cpuffy\u201d/floaty/ in his face &&without making it greasy or oily looking/feeling on his scalp.. he has sensitive skin also && we have been using mainly all natural products since our son was born &&for the last 2years I\u2019ve tried almost EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET to find something for him... organic/natural and salon or drugstore products... he liked Biolage before but it wasn\u2019t quite right..the \u201cULTRA HydroSource\u201d is the winner!!!He is so glad I found him this! Thank goodness!! We all have long hair that tangles easily and it really helps!**We also use the Hydrasource Leave-in**moisturizer &detangling spray && it\u2019s AMAZING if you have kids!! I water mine down as it\u2019s a bit thick && a little too rich for me.. either with wet hands or add water straight to the bottle as it gets used! I have gotten in a routine where I feel like I NEED it! I use straight away after washes before I even towel dry my hair! That way it soaks in but it won\u2019t get too much on too thick!I know this is crazy/stupid long!! BUT I have had such a hard time with my hair especially after having my first baby &&as I get older!(just turned 30!) SO I told my story on the chance someone out there is like me&& needs help & hope!! So I truely hope my review & story helps someone else out there; who has as much trouble as I have;; find this product &it works as well for you as it does for me &&my family!!",
