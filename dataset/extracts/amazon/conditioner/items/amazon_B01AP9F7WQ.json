                "reviewText": "I have been using Pura D'OR Gold anti-hair loss shampoo and the regular conditioner for over a year now. I am very impressed with the quality and effectiveness of the products so I decided to give this deep moisturizing conditioner a try. First, it smells awesome and immediately detangled my hair in the shower. It rinsed out easily and left wet hair smooth and easy to comb through. After blow drying, my hair had life again. The conditioner seemed to bring back some of the shine that had been missing. My hair had body and was not weighed down at all. About my hair: I have more than a few gray hairs which are colored with a semi-permanent hair color. My hair has become dry from the lack of humidity in our Northeast Winter air (also forced hot air heating). My hair color was drab as it needs redoing. In the past few years, I have struggled with thinning hair due to menopause. I have found that using the PURA D'OR line of hair products for anti-hair loss has helped a lot. I am posting a picture I took today. My hair looked like this after a day of errand running. I loved that it had lots of body, a beachy look and STILL HAD SHINE. I recommend this product for daily use to anyone who had normal to dry hair. If you have oily hair and dry ends then it would really help smooth those ends out and bring some color enhancement to your hair. I have also added another picture take the day after with a smoother look so you could see the shine better. Please do pair it with one of the anti-hair loss shampoos. The LAST PICTURE is where I STARTED with my hair loss recovery journey over 15 months ago. In depth reviews are on the Pura D'OR Gold shampoo listing. The products need to be used together for at least three months.If this review has been helpful to you please press the \"helpful\" button. Also, if I can answer any question about the this conditioner just send me a message. I have left reviews for the other Pura D'OR products I have used (gold shampoo and organic conditioner). I have additional pictures there of my hair loss recovery journey.",

                "reviewText": "I'm experiencing continued and unexplained hair shed. I'm not old enough to be dealing with this and washing my hair has become something I absolutely dread, but it is what it is. Like everyone, I took to Amazon and the web to find a solution and the solution is, basically, Rogaine. My derm confirmed this, didn't even blink. (Do your research, however - everything has a side effect and a catch).Topical Biotin is generally not going to help the cause of hair loss - there's little science behind that idea (and technically, you're really only supposed to put conditioner on your mid-lengths to avoid oily roots later, so scalp contact should be minimal). Most often the issue needs to be treated from the inside because the inside and for temporary effects there's the Rogaines of the world. There's some study(ies?) coming out that say MELATONIN could be something to look into but it hasn't been studied enough for hair loss (and it's a hormone, yikes). Check out Dr. Dray's videos on this topic on Youtube.I won't be here to add to the hope that this product will solve your problems because it has not solved mine - I bought it knowing it wouldn't but I liked the ingredient list (if it made a real difference for you, though, bravo).I really like this conditioner for it's basic properties - it's thick but light, very rich texture without being oily or heavy. It feels....expensive. So, as much as I dread washing my hair now, I definitely look forward to using this after my shampoo because Nizoral feels like it strips alllll the moisture from your hair. I put this on and clip my hair up while I shower to let it do its thing. I have shiny, smooth hair after - at least something I can enjoy in the midst of all this! This review was kind of anticlimactic, even for me lol",

For me, this is the best shampoo and conditioner out there. It is a little pricey, but it is worth it. Absolutely recommend it. (I hair fine hair that was thinning quickly. This product has drastically reduced the thinning.)",
