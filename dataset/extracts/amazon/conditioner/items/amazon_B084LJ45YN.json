It's so invigorating and long-lasting, making every shower a delightful experience. I often get compliments on how good my hair smells after using this conditioner.If you're looking for a conditioner that not only delivers great results but also provides an amazing fragrance experience, the Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Conditioner is a must-try.

I decided to give this conditioner a try because of the price point and the reviews about the amazing scent. My conclusion: the scent is fine, pleasant even, but more salon-like than I prefer. However the conditioner itself is great! I can actually use it without shampoo 4 out of 5 washes because it doesn't leave it oily feeling. I've always wanted to co-wash but I did not think that was possible back when I used suave professionals or tresemme. I will be ordering this brand again but experimenting with the other scents. I haven't tried their shampoo as I am currently happy with Hair One's cleansing \"conditioner\" as a once a week shampoo.",
