                "reviewText": "My hair is curly and on the thinner side so heavy products really weighs my curls down. If you have issues with heavy products or weighed down hair, I\u2019d recommend this. I\u2019m not a baby (obviously) but I just rub this through my hair and allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes while I finish my shower routine and it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized without that tacky feeling of built up unnecessary chemicals and product. My hair also looks and feels visibly healthier after using and I have no issues with detangling afterwards. As for the smell, it smells really good! Like a sweet lemon pound cake. Not overly so, and I\u2019m not sure if the scent lasts after washing. Overall, I really like this products and have no issues.",

                "reviewText": "I personally think this is the best conditioner I\u2019ve ever used. I use it differently than most. I use one pump at the end of my shower and do not rinse out. I have 18 inch long, thicker than most hair. The conditioner has no lingering smell, which I can\u2019t tolerate. The bottle lasts a very long time due to the way I use it. I do subscribe and save to get a %age off. If you are looking for a matching set (shampoo and conditioner combo) this is NOT the end of your journey. While the shampoo is good, works well, and doesn\u2019t bother my sensitive skin, you have to use about 15 pumps per use. 3 bottles of shampoo to 1 of conditioner. If this doesn\u2019t bother you... then I would recommend the set. I truly like the formulation of the conditioner. It makes my hair silky and so easy to brush.",

I am now on my second bottle and the pumps on both stopped working, one broke on the third day of use. Even when the pumps did work, it was awkward and dispensed the shampoo so close to the side of the bottle that you had to tilt it to the side to get the product in the middle of your palm. It would be SO much better if it came in a tube like the lotion does.",
