I have color treated, highlighted, long, type 2b wavy hair. I swim in a chlorinated pool and live in a region with hard water. I now use many Davines and Olaplex products, but the two most important to keep my hair manageable and healthy looking are this product and Davines Oi Oil (the best smelling hair product ever, at least to me).",
