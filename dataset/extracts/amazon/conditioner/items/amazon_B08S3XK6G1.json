Dandruff shampoo helped the flaking short term but ultimately dried out my scalp so much that in the long term the result was even worse flaking. This product balanced everything out perfectly! I\u2019m able to use the clinical strength dandruff shampoo to treat the oiliness and build up without the adverse effect of severe drying. I use this right after I shampoo with a scalp brush to ensure it really gets through the roots of my thick hair. It has resolved my scalp issues, and as an added bonus my hair is softer than ever. It feels healthy again! I have less frizziness and fly aways! Which I find crazy because I\u2019m naturally a very frizzy gal, but even more so when using the dandruff shampoo since it\u2019s very dehydrating and strips my hair of all the \u201cgood stuff\u201d. 10/10 I recommend; but I do wish the bottle were easier to squeeze! Not for people with arthritis! Can easily be solved with a hand pump or other device that dispenses conditioner.",

                "reviewText": "We stayed at hotel on campus of world renowned cancer center. Inside hotel room they has Neutrogena shampoo and conditioner trial size bottles. Also stayed at Hilton and they had Neutrogena. If the cancer center and Hilton had this product I felt comfortable using it. It cleans hair and condition's hair. The price is reasonable I cannot use expensive products anymore as the Biden economy has created too much inflation and has limited my purchasing options. If you purchase high end products just for shampoo and conditioner it can cost $50 and up. $50 buys a few groceries or a tank of gas. I can't justify being selfish buying high end hair products when groceries or gas for car is needed. Besides hair is genetically predisposed to be curly, straight or wavy by the shape of hair follicles. Hair products can only put chemicals on outside cuticles of hair then it wears off with hairs natural oils and friction. You can flat iron and blow dry to break down bonds in the cuticles but over time it dries and breaks hair. You can chemically straighten hair but chemicals are bad for women even if they tell you it's more natural ingredients it's not. They must use chemicals to loosen the bonds in the hair shaft. Doctors found out the chemicals may cause cancer. The chemicals are inhaled or absorbed in skin via scalp. The scalp has pores like the face. The same with hair coloring it's chemicals unless you use henna dye. Look at ingredients. Be safe",
