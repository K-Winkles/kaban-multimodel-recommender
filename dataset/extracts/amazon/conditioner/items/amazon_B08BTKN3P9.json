                "reviewText": "This white conditioner is a staple for me. It's thick but not heavy, and the white color makes it perfect for mixing with veggie-based demi-permanent hair dyes to dilute them when I dye my hair. The large 3-pack means I always have plenty on hand since I use quite a bit when I dye my hair.After letting it sit in my hair for 45-60 minutes, my hair is so soft and shiny. My hair becomes scented for several days and I always get compliments on how nice it smells!",
