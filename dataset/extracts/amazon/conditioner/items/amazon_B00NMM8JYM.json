                "reviewText": "Have been using Cantu Hydrating Cream Conditioner along with the matching Cream shampoo for a few days and I am very happy with this. I have short, thin, fine hair with a slight wave and the conditioner does not weigh my hair down but rather seems to give it body and lift. I do find that with this conditioner if I use a generous amount, work it in really well wherever my hair feels rough and dry and leave it for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it seems to work the best. But I feel you do need to work it into the hair with purpose. The shampoo cleans well and suds up even without sulfates. Also, the scent of the shampoo and conditioner is very mild, sort of fruity/citrusy, not overpowering. I would recommend this hair combo for any hair type.",
