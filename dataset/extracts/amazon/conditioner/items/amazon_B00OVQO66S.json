Limits the tangles. Good price.Everyone's hair is different. Mine: coarse, curly, very dry. This works to ease all of that. I use it for co-shampooing in place of regular shampoo. 2x per week (but I do not live in a grimy city). I also leave it on for longer than recommended, figuring the longer it soaks in, the better.Very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I already tried most of the products of this brand and I can say that the conditioners never disappointed me. They all leave my hair extremely soft and it is so easy to style and brush them in the following days. I chose this conditioner because of its specific benefits listed on the bottle, and I have been noticing visible improvements in my hair, it is more hydrated and less fragile. One thing I don't like, and for which I wouldn't choose this product again, is the scent, but this depends on personal taste. In summary, I would recommend this product because it really gets the job done even though the scent is not the best.",

It's not too thick or too thin. It smells lovely and doesn't leave a build-up. I was very pleased and will stick with this, after I'm done the bottles I have.
