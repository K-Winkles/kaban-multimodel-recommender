She literally can sit still in a chair and within an hour, the nape of her neck is tangled. But if she is out doing normal activities, forget it. She gets MATTED on a daily basis. Her hair is fine and it's very painful to brush out the knots. So we got this and she is able to brush her hair while this product is on her hair in the shower. We are so happy with the results. It's super expensive so it had to be AMAZING to be worth the price. Well, I think it is.",

It doesn't make my hair greasy and can be used on its own or in addition to wash-out conditioner.Tips:I don't use it at the roots or on my fringe.Brush your hair straightaway after applying - leaving it to dry in causes tangles and is therefore counter-productive!",
