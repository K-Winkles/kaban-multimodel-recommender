My hair was so frizzy and looked horrible. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and first time I used this set my hair was so soft and not frizzy and I was very happy with the results. I\u2019ve used it three times now and my head doesn\u2019t itch from being so dry. I will definitely be getting more. Wish I could get it in a bigger bottle though! Also, Aveeno is only company I have found that doesn\u2019t use tocopheral acetate aka as Vitamin E in all of their shampoo products which I am allergic too. Thank you!!",
