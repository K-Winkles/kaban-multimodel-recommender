Blackwoods hydro blast moisturizer meets all three criteria with flying colors.1. Hair feels extremely smooth soft and has a nice sheen to it after just a couple uses2. Strong natural scent that definitely feels masculine leaning3. If you look at the ingredients label you will be surprised by the natural ingredients in this moisturizer (peach leaf and citric ingredients)This is a strong buy and I would highly recommend this product for men looking for the above three criteria",
