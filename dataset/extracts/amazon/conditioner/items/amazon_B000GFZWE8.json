                "reviewText": "My husband and I both have long curly hair (3A and 2A, respectively) amd when I say this is the BEST conditioner I have found for our hair, I'm not kidding. I've tried mamy different conditioners from popular brands, all claiming to be hydrating and good for curly hair but this one takes the cake! At an affordable pricw too, with a lot of product and it also smells very clean and refreshing. Definitely buying again.",

                "reviewText": "Last week I lost a lot of my long, thick, healthy hair following a trauma. What was left was 'thin' and crunchy with no volume and shine. My stylist recommended a good reconstructor and such was my desperation that I bought the first one I saw on Amazon - Nexxus. I read the reviews, liked what I read and pressed the buy button for Nexxus Emergency Reconstructor and Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner.The results are truly stunning; unbelievably good; my hair looks vastly thicker and more volumised and I even have beautiful silkiness, shine and movement that are even better than before. I am utterly thrilled with Nexxus products and will keep up fortnightly treatments. I now feel brave enough not only to go out but to feel good about my hair. To impress on you the qualities of the Nexxus Reconstructor and this Nexxus Humectress conditioner, I am happy to share the fact that I'm a mature lady this side of 70 who can truly say that I've never had better quality hair. I'm one very happy customer. Thank you Nexxus.",
