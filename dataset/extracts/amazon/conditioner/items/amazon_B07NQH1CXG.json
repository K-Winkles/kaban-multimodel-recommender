My hair has a mixture of different curl types but nothing too curly and might be considered more wavy. However, I have a very frizzy top layer of hair. This conditioner has solved all my frizzy and dry problems. When I blow dry I can get away without straightening it if I want and I can actually let my hair air dry and have a similar texture throughout now!",
