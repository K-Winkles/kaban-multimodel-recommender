                "reviewText": "Fantastic conditioner for dry, color processed hair. I have longer curly hair that is very dry. I have color treated my hair for 20 yrs (highlighting since I was a teen) and it has taken it's toll. My hair is course and lacks that luster/shine we all seek. After years of trying traditional conditioners (it seems every product has a line) with little satisfaction, I thought outside the box. I went to my local Target, went for the small and often neglected multicultural section of beauty products and bought several different brands. I am embarrassed to say, that it never dawned on me prior to that. I purchased leave in conditioners, hair masks, creams, sprays and good old conditioner.Methodically I tried each product in hopes of a soft, bouncy, hydrated curls. Carols Daughter Vanilla conditioner nailed it. My hair is silk soft and manageable with this product. I only need a dab the size of a quarter to half dollar and let it soak in while I shave or loofa. Just a minute or two and rinse. My hair is easy to comb through, smells outstanding and shines! Yes, the dull, course over processed hair shines. This stuff is impressive and worth every penny.On a side note, although I love this conditioner, I am not a huge fan of the shampoo in this line or spray leave in conditioner. The shampoo feels thick and my hair doesn't feel clean. The consistency, while probably good for my hair feels oily and it is as if I can't wash it out? The leave in conditioner smells amazing, but I don't really see or feel a difference in my hair when I use it.As for where to purchase, Walmart and Amazon seem to be neck an neck on price. It varies by a few pennies depending on when it's purchased. Target is always $1 to $2 more per bottle.",

It worked great the first couple of times I used it. But it does not detangle my hair easily unless I use quite a bit of it, which wears my hair down. And it does not much for my frizz. I'll work through the bottle but I don't think I'll be buying it again. This is not a good fit for my curly/wavy thick hair.",
