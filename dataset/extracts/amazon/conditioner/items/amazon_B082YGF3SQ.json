                "reviewText": "I\u2019m cursed with tons of chemical sensitivities plus a massively over sensitive sense of smell. Suffice to say finding hair products is a challenge.I love this one so much. Not only does it work well, the smell is amazing. Most people probably wouldn\u2019t smell much of anything, to me it has a lovely mild almost fruity smell that I find quite nice. It also doesn\u2019t do that weird thing some conditioners do of leaving your hair smelling kind of like rancid oil. Once it\u2019s washed out there is no smell at all.I absolutely recommend trying it if you\u2019re like me and have any sort of fragrance sensitivities. If you don\u2019t I still recommend trying it because it works great and you\u2019ll help make the world a little bit safer for those of us who do!Emissions from the scents in personal care products in the morning rival the emission levels of rush hour traffic (seriously, the NOAA proved this in a study) so choosing something that doesn\u2019t put those off is the kind choice for the planet too!",

It doesn\u2019t leave that gross buildup feeling that other conditioners do even after you rinse forever, my hair feels really soft, and it doesn\u2019t weigh down my hair! My only problem, and it\u2019s really not much of a problem since I use a scented oil in my hair after, is the smell. It\u2019s kind of tangy-sour. I don\u2019t love it. It doesn\u2019t linger after I dry my hair without any other products on it, but the faint sour scent stays in my hair while it\u2019s wet. After it dries, it goes away, though. Other than that, it\u2019s great!",

I Purchased both the shampoo and the conditioner twice and it did absolutely nothing for my dry, itchy scalp. I also have long, thick and wavy/curly hair and I did not find that the conditioner did much for that either.",
