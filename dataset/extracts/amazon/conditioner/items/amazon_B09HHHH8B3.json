                "reviewText": "Hair type: long, fine, thick, straight and color treatedI had high hopes after reading the reviews and I gotta say, I was let down. The price is great but it's not worth it. The conditioner appears thick until u go to use it and it's got the consistency of Suave where it's basically water. It does not coat your hair and there's no way it closes the cuticle back up, it just washes off leaving your hair dry and tangled. I've seen better hotel conditioners to be honest. I won't even color my hair while using this since this does nothing and it will leave my hair damaged. I normally use Aussie or tresseme so its not like im comparing it to any salon brand. U will get better results and better smelling conditioner with any other brand. My daughter has long thin, fine hair and very rarely colors her hair and she wasn't a fan of it as well and said it made her hair feel dry and like all the conditioner washes off no matter how much she uses.If you happen to have shorter hair and get it cut often where you don't have to deal with tangles and split ends and you're sensitive to fragrance than give it a try I suppose. Other than that, I will not buy more, nothing in this line and I wouldn't recommend it.",
