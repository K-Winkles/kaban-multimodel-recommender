I highly recommend buying this and using it every day for your child while they are in school especially in elementary or preschool or day care because you never know and in the meantime they can easily catch lice anytime but this stuff works at preventing it from ever happening I will constantly keep using it on him. And he does not mind the scent or anything it's overall very pleasant!!!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: When purchased in 10/2018 both the shampoo and the conditioner came with pumps!!! Thank you so much for adding these. They are great and help tremendously with the bottles being so big and little hands. The only sad thing is I purchased pumps when I ordered because I knew we'd need them so now we have extra. Oh well, it was still a nice jester on the company's part. Thanks again!!ORIGINAL:We found out that a cousin that was at our house playing had head lice, a few days after the fact. We did a preventative Rid treatment (against my preference because of all the chemicals) because I did not want to deal with head lice in our home. Everyone was treated with Rid, we checked every other day with combs, then did a second treatment and thankfully, haven\u2019t seen a thing. I purchased these for daily use throughout the school year. Having a false alarm scare was all I needed to know that head lice is really not something I want to deal with. The smell is really nice, and everyone in the house is using this with the shampoo. Hopefully it really will work well!!",

                "reviewText": "I started using the Fairy Tales products when my kids were in preschool - they both have a lot of hair and I wanted to avoid lice if at all possible. We used the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner for years. I ran out and took for granted that maybe it was a placebo, so I didn\u2019t reorder...and then BOOM - both of my kids got lice. Super lice! We couldn\u2019t get rid of them with Nix or Rid. They just wouldn\u2019t die. We used the Fairy Tales lice treatment on an almost daily basis, and it saved us - we didn\u2019t have to use poison on the kids (that wasn\u2019t killing the lice anyway). With diligence, we were able to finally get rid of them. And we placed an auto subscription for the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner so we would never run out. Prevention is the easiest way to get rid of lice! Super lice are a crazy pain to get rid of. Save yourself some (or lots! of) aggravation and use the preventative products to keep your sanity and keep lice away. I highly recommend the Fairy Tales line of products - they work, AND smell good!",
