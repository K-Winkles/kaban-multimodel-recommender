Each time my hair comes out soft and silky and very smooth. The only thing I would not recommend is using it on short thin hair. When used on that length and thickness it can cause the hair to become greasy sooner. Before I used this my hair was so unmanageable I couldn\u2019t even braid it and now it\u2019s so easy! Yes it is a little bit expensive but it is totally worth it! If you suffer from dry and puffy hair this is for you!",

                "reviewText": "It DID make my hair shiny. But also dry. Drier than any other shampoo/conditioner I have used. And I didn\u2019t realize when I bought it that it contains sulfates, which means you shouldn\u2019t use this if you do keratin treatments/Brazilian blowouts. Since those are for people who want smooth/shiny hair, this product should have been able to work for them.",
