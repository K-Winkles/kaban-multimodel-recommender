I bought the brand because I like Aveeno lotion. I thought the conditioner sounded good and was a good price. The one I got smells like eucalyptus and not floral as some reviews mentioned. It feels thick and not creamy. Most conditioners I use have a silky smooth feel and leave my hair feeling silky and soft and moisturized. This did not. It\u2019s hard to work it into the hair. For lack of better description it seems to have a lot of drag. I seem to have to use a lot more product to get it worked into my hair and get the coverage I need. My hair doesn\u2019t feel soft or silky. In fact it seemed a lot drier and dead looking. I would not recommend. I have color treated hair which tends to be dry just in case you have similar. This product is not for me. I just colored my hair and used the after color conditioner that comes with the product and I noticed a remarkable improvement in my hair\u2019s texture, silkiness, shine, and manageability. The Aveeno is going in the trash.",
