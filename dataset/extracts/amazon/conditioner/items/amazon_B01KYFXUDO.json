                "reviewText": "I want to use this product for the rest of my life.I have 4a/4b low porosity hair and nothing melts into my hair. Every products sits on top of my hair and eventually dries two days later. Every product flakes or leaves white residue. I was hopeless until I found this product. As soon as I applied this leave-in, it melted into my hair straight away and dries within 5-10 minutes.HAVE YOU EVER BOUGHT A LEAVE-IN THAT DRIES IN UNDER 10 MINUTES?!This is perfect to use in the mornings especially when you're in a rush to get work/school, etc. You don't have to wait 30 minutes for it to dry, you can just use it and go. No flakes, no residue.Tips:- Use on wet or damp hair. (Can use on dry hair but it wont tame frizz as well. Regardless, using it on dry hair will not leave you with any residue)- Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.- Buy two bottles if you can, so you don't have to worry about it running out- Can apply on roots and ends without any shrinkage woahhhh- Smell is strong but wares off after 30 mins",

                "reviewText": "As a black woman w/ super curly hair, it's hard to find a product that adequately moisturizes my hair. I've tried a lot of different kinds of leave ins but they mostly dry out my hair & make it hard. I loved this from the moment I tried it cause aside from smelling amazing (wish it was edible lol), it actually works. Having black hair, I can't be washing my hair everyday so when it comes to refreshing my curls, I need something that will put the moisture back in my hair during mid week stylings & such. I've been using Creme of Nature products for yrs but this leave in is my new favorite 1...it makes my hair so soft & my curls feel lush...I can run my fingers through my hair w/out having to use a comb so I guess this detangles too...It's like the life is being put back in my curls. A little really goes a long way w/ this stuff...I have a lot of hair but I only use about a quarter sized amount & that's enough to get the job done. I swear since using this I've had little to no breakage & my hair is shinier than ever. I don't know where this stuff has been my whole life but I'm glad I found it now.",
