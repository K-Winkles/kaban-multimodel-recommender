I highly recommend this enriching conditioner.",

It took me a while to realize I had a chronically irritated scalp from what I believe was from use of too many products with too many ingredients that didn\u2019t rinse off well. All the heavy multifunction products built up in my scalp and didn\u2019t let it breathe. Vanicream products remedied this while being gentle yet very effective on hair and scalp. My scalp feels so much better and is way less sensitive.",

We learned choosing fragrance free seems to be key for us or at least have a mild light scent. She also doesn't need protein as it makes her hair straw like. Formaldehyde also causes issues. This omits all of them. I personally find this more drying than my cowash but she doesn't work the cowash into her hair well enough so this shampoo works great for her.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners over the last few years since my hair texture and scalp started changing. My scalp has always been on the oily side, but it suddenly started getting super oily. So I tried lots of different conditioners. I tried only using conditioner on the very ends, skipping every other wash, every two washes, and eventually just leave in. My hair felt okay on the ends, but wasn\u2019t shiny like it used to be. And my scalp was definitely dry and irritated, and even started flaking from it. Finally I tried this conditioner, and my hair feels almost back to normal! Even when I used it directly on my scalp for the first few washes to give my poor scalp some much needed moisture and tlc, my hair wasn\u2019t greasy looking by the end of the day. My hair is shiny again, and it doesn\u2019t irritate my sensitive skin at all! Even when only using other conditioners on the very ends of my hair, it looked fully dirty by the end of the day. This conditioner is seriously a lifesaver!",

                "reviewText": "This product was not my favorite - I second all the reviews that mention how this product can feel a bit drying. I don't think it completely sucks out moisture from my hair, but it definitely does not feel moisturizing or nourishing to the hair. It does an okay job of conditioning it, but I can't bring myself to finish the bottle because I can't stand how it makes my hair feel dry and brittle. If fragrance free/clean ingredients are important to you, then this might be a good option for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest finding a different product.",

                "reviewText": "The product itself is great It takes only a drop to make my hair soft and manageable without flattening it. The problem is the plastic container. The conditioner is very thick and so it is difficult, if not impossible, to squeeze out because container is very stiff. This morning I couldn't get any out and, having just gotten the tube, couldn't believe it was empty. So I took a box cutter and sliced the tube in half. By the time I was finished doing a very sloppy job of spooning it out into a 16 oz. glass jar, you can see how much I rescued. And because I know glass isn't safe in the shower. I keep the jar on a shelf in the medicine cabinet and fill a little plastic container as needed. Why, oh why, can't the put it in the flexible tube like they use for their hair gel?",
