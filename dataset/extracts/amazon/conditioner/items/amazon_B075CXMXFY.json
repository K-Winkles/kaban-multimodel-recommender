As someone with dry, damaged, and frizzy hair, I have tried countless products over the years, but this conditioner has truly exceeded my expectations. The fact that it's sulfate-free is a huge plus since I'm trying to avoid harsh chemicals. The conditioner is made with natural ingredients like argan oil which provides my hair with the moisture and nourishment it needs to look and feel its best. The texture of the conditioner is creamy and luxurious, and it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky from the first use. After several uses, my hair is much more manageable, and I'm noticing a reduction in frizz and breakage. I also appreciate that the conditioner doesn't weigh my hair down or leave any residue, which is important to me since I have fine hair. Overall, I would highly recommend Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner to anyone looking for a high-quality product that can transform even the most damaged, dry, curly or frizzy hair!",

I commonly finger detangle my curls and this works through the hair well to do that. The product is okay! But I feel like I\u2019ve had better argon conditioner personally. Not bad but not great overall in my opinion.",
