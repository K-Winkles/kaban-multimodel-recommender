                "reviewText": "I have been getting keratin treatments every three months on my long, grey hair. My hair is frizzy and unruly. As the keratin wears off between treatments it is increasingly difficult to get a comb through my freshly washed, wet hair! Thankfully, since I started using this product combing my wet strands is a breeze. I use a wide toothed hair pick or comb to make sure I thoroughly work it through while in the shower and I try to leave it in for at least three minutes before rinsing. It makes a world of difference! This is the only product I have found that actually helps and I have tried so so many! I tried Wow by Chris Appleton and 3 Minute Miracle and\u2026nothing worked until this! So grateful to have found it.",
