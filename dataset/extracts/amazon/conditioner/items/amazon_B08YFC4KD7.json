When this goes on in the shower, you may feel like it's not as thick and luxurious as other conditioners but that's only because of the filler they pump into those mixtures. This, on the other hand, does absolutely rinse beautifully and my hair has never been shinier, more moisturized, and no frizz at all. Highly recommend.",

I'm going to go to the health store to buy some natural aromatic stuff to put in it so I'm not walking around smelling like plastic. Kind of nice I guess that I can switch up the scent if I want, lol!",
