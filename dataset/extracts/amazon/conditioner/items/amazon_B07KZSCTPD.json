I just leave it in, let it dry, and no more frizz, no tangles, smooth as silk, VERY shiny, yet it still looks and feels sooo clean and fresh! This is a definite re-buy for me and a thumbs-up recommendation. I don't put it on my scalp, as I'm not sure how good that would look after drying.I use just a little of this in my palm with water to spread it out thinly, then pat it onto the length of my wet hair. If I had 4B or 4C hair, I would probably coat each strand of clean hair WITHOUT using extra water.This stuff is YUMMY and smells wonderful even after drying.",

Wasn't sure at first but after using for a few weeks noticed my hair was easier to brush through and the hair was softer. We have since added the coconut shampoo and with both we have both noticed that our hair is softer and has a better feel. I know this isn't what a guy would normally be writing about but since my hair and beard(it too feels better) are longer than normal with being unable to get to a barber shop/salon (thanks CA) it's just the way it is. Also contacted the vendor and to quote their name WOW, their customer service is fantastic and their response time is great.",

Blow drying and using a other heating styling tools certainly didn't help.I have tried almost every shampoo, conditioner, oils, hair masks known to man...Nothing worked or helped. No matter what shampoo or conditioner I used my hair always had an odd odor to it.I decided to try WOW. I opted to try the conditioner, and the hair oil.After the first use my hair felt soft, It had body, volume and was manageable and after many years of not having a shine, I finally saw a shine to my hair.I noticed upon rinsing that my hair felt totally clean and didn't have that conditioner \"coating\" I normally get with other conditioners. I thought \" this isn't going to work\". Well after styling I was amazed. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!I would definitely recommend this conditioner. I am going to purchase the shampoo as well.",

                "reviewText": "I first received both the ACV shampoo and conditioner back in May with my first ever order, I was amazed at first with the results and my hair seemed to grow at a faster pace then normal over the next few months prior. About 2 months into using it, I noticed my hair became very dry at the ends even with leaving in the conditioner. I liked that the products made my hair grow quicker, but in return it was slowly damaging my ends...my advice to you is this: enjoy it while you can, but as soon as it stops working STOP using it! I was disappointed that my hair started to break at the ends, but it didn\u2019t surprise me because my hair has a tendency to get used to products very quickly. Overall, not a bad product but beware of overusage and dried hair.",

If you shampoo too often without using the conditioner it will dry your hair, at least speaking for myself, but using the conditioner with it takes care of any dryness. Will keep buying.",

My hair was so dry, it felt like straw. Good for frizzy hair? My hair got frizzier and more out of control. Shiny hair? My hair was dull and heavy. Tangles? If you want your hair to be so hopelessly tangled, sure, get this conditioner. My family and I tried this conditioner, along with it's partner shampoo, on three separate occasions. We all had the same complaints. Back it went. I was afraid I had to get a foot of my hair chopped off! Luckily, my hairdresser saved most of my tresses. I DON'T recommend this for dry or curly hair!",
