I purchased this product because I know Biolage professionals is a good shampoo which has a fabulous scent and leaves hair feeling and looking healthy and soft. I loved the scent a lot. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was the amount of shampoo is only 1.7 fluid oz like a travel size bottle at a bit of a high price for the amount you get per bottle. This brand is usually out of my budget range so I rarely can purchase it but if I could afford it I'd definitely buy it all the time. Perfect for hotel stays, travelling, or even to use every once in a while for better hair at this size of a bottle of you don't mind running out quicker of the product or can afford a top notch brand such as this one. When I can afford it I'd buy it again.",

My hair was so dry and dull from coloring it, and I have only been using the name brand shampoos and conditioners from Walmart with no improvement. I used the shampoo and conditioner today when I received it, and after just one use I can already tell a huge difference!!! My hair is SO much softer and it's shiny! I just can't get over how soft it is! AND it feels light and clean. Most \"moisturizing\" shampoos and conditioners weigh my hair down and leaves my hair feeling heavy and coated, almost like I hadn't rinsed the conditioner out well enough, but not this glorious shampoo and conditioner!!! I can't praise this stuff enough! HIGHLY recommend this shampoo and conditioner! This will be the only shampoo and conditioner I use from now on! I'm so glad I finally found the good stuff :)",
