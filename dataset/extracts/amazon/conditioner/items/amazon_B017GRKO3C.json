My stylist recommended the shampoo and conditioner to me and after just a few uses, I saw my hair normalizing. Instead of having random curly areas, I found my hair was becoming more consistently straight so I could dry it in a chin length style( shorter in back, longer on the sides) and not have one side and half of the back curl up while the rest just hung. It also makes my hair much more manageable without being too soft and overconditioned ( read, oily looking).I highly recommend this product and will look into their other ones because of my experience with their shampoo and conditioner.",

                "reviewText": "The bottles are nice packaging, a little goes a long way, and the smell is pleasant. As far as it thickening my hair or promoting hair growth, I cannot attest to that as it\u2019s only been used twice. I will update as I use it more. I will say it does not wear my hair down like many hair conditioners and I\u2019ll like it so far. I did buy this with the shampoo by the same brand with the biotin. I can tell a difference in the volume and shininess of my hair after several uses. I will buy both again.",

I love the scent and packaging, and I think your hair falls out less after using this because it does a great job of smoothing and detangling, but I will be purchasing another conditioner that is better value for money going forward. It is just sooo small and a bit disappointing because it goes so fast. It is also a thick conditioner, so it is hard to get out after a couple uses.",
