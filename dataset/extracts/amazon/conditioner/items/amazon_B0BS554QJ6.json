It provides lightweight nourishment without weighing down strands and enough conditioning to transform dry, frizzy, damaged locks into shiny, smooth hair. Is the conditioner clear or creamy? It\u2019s a creamy, lightweight conditioner that will help restore your hair\u2019s natural shine. Infused with argan oil, it tames frizz and smooths down flyaways for smooth, manageable strands. Do I need to use Pantene Pro-V Blends Argan Oil Shampoo with this conditioner? For best results and more great hair days, it\u2019s recommended to pair this conditioner with Pantene Pro-V Blends Argan Oil Shampoo. However, it\u2019s still effective when used alone without the matching shampoo. Is Pantene cruelty-free? Pantene has been committed to ending animal testing for over 30 years. We do not test our products on animals and have been actively working with governments around the world to put an end to animal testing for good. Why is sulfate-free important? While sulfates are a common cleaning ingredient, some Pantene fans prefer alternatives that are free from specific ingredients. With that in mind, we created formulas that are free sulfates, parabens, and silicones while still delivering great hair.",
