The bottles were loose in a large box. I see that others have had the same problem that should be addressed as customers deserved to have products wrapped to avoid damage. As far as the shampoo, like I said I have ordered more than one type and I alternate them. The results have been wonderful. My hair is damaged from having major surgery and a very long complicated hospital stay. Lots of pain killers. This just destroyed my hair. It was breaking off badly, falling out and dry and frizzy. But no more of that ...it is soft, has bouncy curls and is gaining strength as I am finding very little hair now in my brush. I love all the Garnier products ... check out the ones for the face ..they are equally wonderful.",

                "reviewText": "So for anyone that\u2019s ever bleached their hair. They should know. It gets dry. Crunchy straw like feel. Especially after shampooing. You might as well use it to make a broom.Well I didn\u2019t have high expectations for this. I had planned to keep using the conditioners that came with my hair color and bleach kits. I bleached from black to light yellow blonde. And then I used another lightening color kit for light brown hair. So since I also did it back to back 2 hrs with a blow dry in between it\u2019s about as damaged and dried out as it can get. I used this conditioner. And I haven\u2019t needed the conditioner that came with the kit. It washes out well. It\u2019s so hydrating my hair looks like a child\u2019s. It\u2019s shiny wet looking and no frizz. Smell is great too not too strong.Pump makes it worth the purchase each to use and looks nice that the bottles are semi transparent so you can see the product as you use it up.I dunno what this other reviewer was talking about saying it made her hair feel course. Maybe she didn\u2019t use enough \ud83d\ude06I used about 3 blobs size of a quarter on shoulder length hair and it was amazing.I\u2019m never going back to other brands that cost 3x as much. This was a good deal for $8",
