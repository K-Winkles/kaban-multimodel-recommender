Do the memories of that awful taste haunt your waking hours even years later? Do you get a sweaty mouth anytime you smell someone else\u2019s cherry flavored treats?If so, then this conditioner is not for you. It has the single most overpowering scent I have ever smelt from a hair product \u2013 maraschino cherries. The smell will permeate your entire bathroom as you shower and will LAST on your hair all day. My towel smelled like it, my shirt smelled like it, and every time the wind blew, I caught another goosebump inducing whiff.The nausea from the cherry cough syrup smell aside, this conditioner is WONDERFUL. My hair feels silky, smooth, and hydrated. It isn\u2019t heavy \u2013 my hair air dried quicker than normal, with minimal tangling. I feel that the price is great for the quality of the product. I would happily continue using this conditioner if not for the smell.Do you like cherry scents? Do you have a masochistic need to wallow in memories of childhood illness? Are you completely nose blind? Then ABSOLUTELY get this conditioner \u2013 it works amazingly.But if you\u2019re like me\u2026maaaaaybe try another product from Acure\u2019s line.",

Found this brand from someone on Instagram who focuses on products that nourish and heal the body without the harmful chemicals you find in most products. I\u2019ve been using this for almost a year now and my hair feels so healthy and clean, and I feel good about using it!",

Naturally drying my hair leaves nice and happy wavy curls and I just feel like this suits my hair perfectly.Pretty much this review will go onto the other product.The only thing I'm concerned about is I thought this was purely natural but there's about 50 ingredients with super long names and no description of what they do in particular like on some products.I'm trying to steer as clear as possible from chemicals and sulfates and the nasties most typical brands use that wreck your hair and leave you needing to buy 17 other products to fix the issues they caused.Otherwise though? If you don't care about those parts go wild! It's a great product :)",
