                "reviewText": "I bought this conditioner to go with the shampoo I had already purchased (but couldn't find the conditioner to match at the store). And let me tell you...it was the most amazing experience I have had with a store bought product. It left my hair feeling so amazingly soft and healthy! I got so many comments from people asking if I did something with my hair, it made me feel so good. It's the best store bought product for your hair and one amazing value for the price! I am a new fan and have already repurchased it a couple times! Highly suggest trying.",

I\u2019ve tried so many conditioners in my life & most of them never worked very well. I am beyond THRILLED with this conditioner! I was able to comb my hair without using a detangling spray & my hair feels silky & hydrated!!!!! It also has shine now! I knew it would probably be wonderful when I saw that it had hyaluronic acid in it. I hope they never stop making it! Now I\u2019m anxious to try the shampoo.",

                "reviewText": "I have searched for a conditioner than could really hydrate my dry hair without weighing it down or making it look greasy. I have tried very expensive brands and wasn't completely happy with them. A friend suggested L'Oreal Paris Elvive Hyaluron Plump Hydrating Conditioner and I bought it and the shampoo with no expectations of having a good experience. BOOM! Holy grail. This conditioner is rich and concentrated. It makes my hair so smooth and soft but doesn't weigh it down and I have plenty of volume. I never thought a drugstore hair product could do what this one does for my hair. I color it, use hot styling tools on it, apply loads of styling products, and it is naturally dry so I need a lot of help. This conditioner (and the accompanying shampoo) does it. About every six weeks, I will I use Elvive Total Repair 5 Damage-Erasing Balm with Almond and Protein and my hair in in great condition. I am glad I found an inexpensive line of haircare products that finally work for me.",
