I had been using Matrix Biolage Hydrating Shampoo and Matrix Biolage Detangling Solution for years. A friend told me I should try her L'anza Color Preserving Shampoo & Conditioner, and I loved it. Since I don't color my hair, I bought the regular L'anza shampoo & conditioner. It didn't work as well, though, so I bought the Color Preserving shampoo & conditioner and have been using it for a year and half. Additionally, I started using a small amount of L'anza Keratin Healing Oil massaged into my wet hair after every shower, and it worked wonderfully. After using that for about a year, I decided to look at L'anza's other products and bought some L'anza Healing Strength Neem Plant Silk Serum - it's supposed to be for \"aging hair,\" and I'm in my fifties. I like it even better. Both of them detangle my hair, make it shinier and healthier, and don't make my hair oily at all. I shampoo my hair every other day or once in a while every third day, and it's never even slightly oily.",

                "reviewText": "The shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING!! I have never actually had soft hair after it's been bleached. Super glad I splurged. Posting this on the conditioner, shampoo, silver care shampoo and hair oil products. I use the silver care once or twice a week, and the regular shampoo 2-3x a week (I only wash hair every other day). Conditioner every time I get my hair wet. I use the oil on dry hair usually but sometimes damp. The whole routine was suggested by my hair stylist at Tiana\u2019s Hair Salon in Albuquerque, NM. That girl is amazing at her job!",
