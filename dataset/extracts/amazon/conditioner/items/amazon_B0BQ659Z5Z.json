I am ethnically Irish/Caucasian and have curly hair. I have been purchasing different products to find the right one for my hair- and so far conditioner labeled for curly hair has worked for my hair texture. This is the first conditioner that has made my hair dry and frizzy. I will either return or throw out.",

                "reviewText": "The conditioner itself is fine and works well on my hair. It is almost impossible to get out once it gets down to a 1/4 bottle. Very thick consistency and I even tried leaving the bottle upsidown at night to use the remainder. Tranferred to a bottle with a pump but in the end I wasted most of it. I'm not standing in the shower fighting to get my conditioner out of the bottle for 5 minutes. This product was not tested well before entering the market! Won't buy again. And the bottle is as hard as a brick to begin with - you'll need a firm grip for this one to get your conditioer out of the bottle.",
