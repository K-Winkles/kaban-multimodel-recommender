                "reviewText": "My hair is very very picky. I was liking the Maui Moisture curl line (orange bottles) but I felt like I def still had to use a cream or leave in after. So I was on the hunt for a conditioner with a tiny bit more moisture (but not too much! otherwise my hair gets easily weighed down). This shea moisture conditioner is perfect. It\u2019s not too heavy for me, it\u2019s just right. I used no products after!! Happy so far with this",
