The only reason I gave it one less star is because I noticed it doesn\u2019t work that well if your hair is damaged or dyed. It gives just enough moisture, but it doesn\u2019t feel that conditioned or healthier but I do like that it doesn\u2019t make my hair greasy. There is a very light fragrance that is not noticeable and great for sensitive noses. Of course the bottle is cute overall I think it\u2019s a great by and probably better if you have healthy natural hair, it will work great for you!",
