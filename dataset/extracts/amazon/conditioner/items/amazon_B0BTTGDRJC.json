                "reviewText": "It works well as a slickening agent, making it easy to pull tangles out with, and reduce damage through breaking knots.It does moisturize the hair well. It uses dimethicone to do it, so it works well for straight/wavy hair, especially if you shampoo out the cones each shower. It controls frizz nicely throughout the day. Not great for tight curls, though - I would recommend oil-based conditioners over cone-based conditioners in that case.It's a bit thinner than other conditioners I'm used to, so it's a bit easier to get too much out if you're in a hurry.It smells like a typical conditioner, like a light non-specific floral scent with a bit of citrus. The odor isn't strong, and can only be smelt if directly against the nose after showering.Overall, it's a very normal, mainstream conditioner set at a good price.",

                "reviewText": "With my wife and three daughters, our household goes through a lot of hair products. Most of them have fairly straight hair, but my youngest is very curly and kind of in her own little world. Being the youngest, she often just has to deal with whatever is available for her but not anymore! When I saw this, I thought it would be perfect and she has loved it. I mean, she still hates dealing with her hair, but she doesn't complain about it nearly as much as she used to. Some might say it's because she's growing up, but I refuse to let that happen (she is still my little girl after all). No, I believe it is because this conditioner is designed for people just like her. And best of all, it's actually a pretty good value. You could easily pay as much for one small bottle of fancy stuff that you could for this multi pack and it really wouldn't have any noticeable difference. Save yourself the headache (or hairache) and pick this up instead.",

However, upon giving this conditioner a try, I have to admit I'm a believer. It is so silky and immediately makes my hair feel soft and manageable. I recently went on vacation and was pleasantly surprised how quickly this tamed and untangled my gross, tangled, sea-water, beach hair. Usually my hair would be horrid after multiple consecutive days at the beach, but I had zero issues using this product. My hair feels as great as ever. I really recommend this conditioner and will continue using!",

The caps are also very secure on the bottles, so no leakage.",
