I bought this conditioner both for my scalp and my hair. it is amazing! My hair has been super soft and smells great. My friends told me that my hair had not looked this healthy in a while. Do keep in mind that I chopped a lot of my dead hair. But this conditioner has been taking good care of my hair. I let my hair air dry and it looks super nice, no frizz. One thing I will recommend is to not put too much on the scalp. After I did that I would have to shower again sooner maybe because of the residue of the product on my scalp.",

                "reviewText": "The Neutrogena Soothing & Calming Healthy Scalp Conditioner has become a cherished addition to my hair care routine, providing a refreshing and soothing experience for both my hair and scalp. This conditioner has truly impressed me with its ability to deliver on its promises.The calming properties of this conditioner are immediately noticeable. The moment it touches my scalp, I feel a subtle, cooling sensation that is incredibly relaxing. It's like a mini spa treatment for my hair care routine. The formula is gentle, making it suitable for daily use, and it never fails to leave my scalp feeling refreshed.The scent is both subtle and invigorating. It's not overpowering, yet it adds a touch of freshness that lingers throughout the day. I appreciate that the fragrance is not only pleasant but also contributes to the overall calming effect.Beyond its sensory appeal, the Neutrogena Soothing & Calming Healthy Scalp Conditioner works wonders on my hair. It leaves my locks feeling soft, smooth, and easily manageable. I've noticed a reduction in frizz and an improvement in the overall texture of my hair since incorporating this conditioner into my routine.The conditioner doesn't weigh down my hair, and it rinses out effortlessly, leaving no residue behind. This is particularly important for me as someone with fine hair who often struggles with finding the right balance in hair care products.As with other Neutrogena products, I appreciate the brand's commitment to skin and hair health. The dermatologist-tested formula gives me confidence in the product's safety and effectiveness.In conclusion, the Neutrogena Soothing & Calming Healthy Scalp Conditioner is a gem in the world of hair care. It goes beyond the typical conditioner by delivering a spa-like experience for the scalp while leaving hair soft and manageable. If you're in search of a conditioner that pampers both your hair and scalp, this product is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to elevate their hair care routine with a touch of tranquility. My only issue is the price per bottle which may be a little on the higher end.",
