My hair is so soft, shiny, and moisturized without the heaviness if being weighed down. Absolutely no love it! The smell some have claimed it has, really isn't bad like I had imagined after reading some comments. It actually smells good, but does have a very slight smell different than others, but over all, barely noticeable, compared to the other wonderful scents this has, and w rinsed, that slight off scent washes out completely and hair smells wonderful! Definitely worth it!",
