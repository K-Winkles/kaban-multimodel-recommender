It dislodged completely when I first pressed down on it and will not \u2018snap\u2019 back into place as with most such engineered caps. The bottle is plastic (ugh!) but was well padded in shipping and although there was no discernible damage to the cap itself when opened, it nonetheless is unusable in the normal design sense which may make dispensing difficult and product protection somewhat nullified.Again, great product\u2026good seller\u2026poorly designed and \u2018functioning\u2019 cap.
