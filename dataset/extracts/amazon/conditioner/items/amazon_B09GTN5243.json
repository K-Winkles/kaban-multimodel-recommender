The main reason I'm giving 5 stars though, is that it is difficult to find shampoo/condition set that will clean fine/thin hair without drying and adding frizzy ends, and condition without leaving it dull, oily-looking, weighed down and dark. This leaves my hair silky, shiny and gives some body and movement. Will buy again.",

I had used this brand years ago, but had ended up using other expensive brands throughout the years. So I was extremely surprised when I used this shampoo and conditioner and my long thick frizzy hair was very silky and smelled so heavenly that I purchased both of these as soon as I returned home. It is a wonder after all these years that this brand really does a better job than the more expensive brands I had been using.
