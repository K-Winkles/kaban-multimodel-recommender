It only takes a small amount of this product to do the trick and it'll leave your hair quite soft. I don't use any styling implements so I was satisfied with how my hair feathered back nicely after combing. The smell is nice in the moment and doesn't really linger which is fine, mint and eucalyptus are an awesome combined fragrance but I suspect an overload might turn one into the fabled \"aromatic man.\" Five stars to a tee. This stuffs chic, y'all. A minty fresh experience that leaves your hair as soft as a forest creatures... unless they've been up to mischief.",

I was amazed on how soft my hair was with just the shampoo, but this makes it even better using both.- This product is made in Canada.Cons: - The bottle For the conditioner only comes in a(n) 8oz bottle.- The price per ounce is more than if buying a cheaper quality product that is not made from natural ingredients.",

Luckily I stumbled upon this bottle and decided to try it based off the good reviews and they don't lie. Only been using for a few days and my dry flaky scalp has about 2/3 the dandruff as before, and not only that but my hair actually looks and feels so much softer/fuller and heavier. I also have a super sensitive scalp and this hasn't irritated it all. Smells great too.",
