I admit that I was shocked at how smooth my hair felt when in the shower...so much so that I rinsed for a very long time to make sure that all of the conditioner was cleanly out of my abundant hair.After rinsing well, I then pumped about an 1/8 teaspoon in to my palms and messaged it through the bottom 1/2 of my hair prior to towel drying as a leave in treatment...the scent seemed a bit powerful, yet I persisted with my testI allowed my hair to dry naturally because I\u2019m lazy, tbh... & yes, I was more than pleased with the resultMy hair is soft & bouncy, & stupendously smooth, while the scent is clean & nicely fragrant, not overpowering at all. My hair feels clean & super healthyI am a convert. Goodbye Nexxus, it\u2019s been nice knowing you, but there\u2019s a new superior & less pricey set of haircare containers in my showerPS: I\u2019ll circle back to share pix",

I have a layered cut, so all I do is wash and wear! For more defined curls, I spray a little \u201cIt\u2019s a 10 \u201c leave in conditioner. My husband loves my hair again too. And I am back to getting compliments on my curls.(So far I have only used the conditioner as I am waiting to finish the bottle of shampoo I was using. I can hardly wait to try the shampoo and conditioner together. On a fixed income so I have to wait.)",

First time ordering through Amazon and I was a little disappointed to have a broken bottle. Obviously it's still usable I just had to take the top off of the bottle but it would've been nice to not receive a broken product.",
