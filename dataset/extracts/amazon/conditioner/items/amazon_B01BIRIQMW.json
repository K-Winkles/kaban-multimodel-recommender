Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina. Fascinated by the plant's effect on the elephant, he returned home to India to seek scientific evidence for why this particular plant would have such a beneficial, calming effect. Young Manal's mother gave him her bangles to sell so he could pursue his work, and Himalaya was born. Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical, Mr. Manal bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and began his work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a few hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work paid off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the anti-hypertensive drug in 1934. Himalaya\u2019s legacy has always been one of researching nature and using the tools of modern science to develop and produce Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade herbal medicine products. And today, that legacy continues. Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well. Today, Himalaya Herbal Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a complete range of contemporary, proprietary formulas and single herbs dedicated to making the world well one person at a time. Since 1930, Himalaya has been passionate about the healing wisdom of herbs. We offer a wide range of herbal supplements, toothpaste and personal care products that unlock the powerful healing benefits of herbs.",

I gave it four stars instead of five because it contains some artificial ingredients; however, without them, the product may not work as well. It also is easy to use....I just put it on after shampooing and leave it on my hair only for one minute. If you want a smooth look, this should work for you.",
