                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best conditioner money can buy",
                "reviewText": "I have been using Pantene Smooth & Sleek for years, and every time I get away from it (if it's sold out, for example) I always come back and buy it again as soon as I can. I've tried everything (including the one that everyone's obsessed with that stylists like to try to sell you that starts with an \"o\" and ends with an \"x\", which coincidentally has the same ingredients as this product, at a massively inflated price) and Pantene Smooth & Sleek is by far the most moisturizing, and leaves my hair in the absolute best condition.While other Pantene products are pretty good, this one stands out for me (my fall back is Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal conditioner, but it isn't nearly as good as the Smooth & Sleek.) I have naturally curly (2b) frizzy, bleached hair that I flatiron several times per week. I have been coloring and highlighting my own hair at home for years, and I have tried so many different products and techniques to try to get the hair that I want, while minimizing damage. This stuff is the absolute best. After I shampoo (which I do daily, believe it or not) I make sure to glob it on my wet hair in generous amounts, finger-comb it through, and then leave it on as long as possible while I shower (anywhere from 5-10 minutes.) I always get amazing results.This particular order came with two massively sized bottles of conditioner, and a small single-use vial of a treatment. The treatment itself has the same appearance, consistency, and scent as the hair conditioner, so I'm not entirely convinced it isn't just a little vial of conditioner honestly. \ud83d\ude02 Apart from that, I find this stuff to be great value given how soft and free from breakage it leaves my colour-treated, straightened hair, and the amount of product you receive for the price. I love the two pack, because I regularly shower in two different bathrooms at home, and I can leave one bottle in each room. Unlike with other products, I've never experienced an issue with the pumps on these bottles. They never arrive broken, and they're always super easy to open up and use right away (unlike some other products where the pump keeps spinning but never pops up to open.) Also unlike competitors' products, these bottles have never caused me injury in the shower (don't ask \ud83d\ude02.)I use all kinds of different shampoos from a variety of brands and types, ranging from toning (purple) shampoos, to clarifying, to moisturizing, depending on the condition of my hair and what I'm trying to achieve that day. However, I almost always follow it up with Pantene Smooth & Sleek, and beautiful healthy hair is the result. Honestly, I would continue to buy this if it were 4x the price (but I'm glad it isn't!) I definitely recommend it to others and I hope this product is available for a long time to come.",
