I just could not find any sulfate free shampoo that could relieve the itch and irritation. SO I picked this stuff up been using it for about 6 months now and I LOVE IT. It fully cleanses my hair and removes all the product buildup. I then follow up with a high end (silicone free) conditioner. My hair feels so clean and it looks so shiny. I was afraid that my hair would get dry, but as long as I use a good quality conditioner my results are fantastic!",
