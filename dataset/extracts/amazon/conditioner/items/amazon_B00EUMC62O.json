Also, the product is so rich and thick that that pump (before its fall) wouldn\u2019t bring up the product.I won\u2019t buy this conditioner again until it\u2019s in a user friendly, usable container. I had to, over several days, bang the product out into a new container. At least now I can easily use itMy curly hair likes this product! Manufacturer, please change your packaging!",
