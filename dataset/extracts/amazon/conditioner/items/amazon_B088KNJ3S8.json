                "reviewText": "The company claims it has a light orange-like smell. I don't know what they are talking about- mine has quite a strong smell (that smells almost exactly like Johnson and Johnson baby powder), and it really lingers in your hair for a long time. Like, through a thorough shampooing, and using a clarifying shampoo on my daughters' hair, you could still catch whiffs of it from both of our heads thanks to it doing its' job and penetrating all the good stuff into the strand. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but having a head that smells like a baby's butt for days is something that is good to know before you go in.The company also says it is color safe, but this definitely pushed the dye out of my hair a lot faster than any other conditioner I have tried. Not a problem as I can rotate it with a color depositing daily conditioner, but again good to know before going it.Other than that, it does indeed make my hair feel soft and easier to brush through. I will still use it, just not as often because I am not crazy about the strong, lingering perfumey scent.",

                "reviewText": "I'm going to start with the positives:- I love the scent. I usually buy fruity shampoos and conditioners, while this smells like something you would be given in a salon. I did not expect to like it so much because it's so different from what I usually buy, but it's very nice! Not too strong or overpowering.- It made my hair very silky after the first use! I had been out of conditioner for over a week at that point and was really in need of some. I was extremely impressed with it, and loved the smooth texture of my hair.Now for the negatives:-My hair has a very fine texture that tangles easily, and especially so when using this. I honestly thought I outgrew hair that tangles this badly, but apparently I've just been using good conditioner! My hair stays okay for a day and then it's a rats nest overnight. I have to use a lot of this to keep my hair like it usually is... It's not worth having cheaper shampoo and conditioner if I need to use so much more of it!But, I feel this is most likely ba problem caused by my hair texture, and most people won't see much of a difference. If you're someone like mom, who can go a week without brushing her hair with more than her fingers and it looks perfect, then I think this conditioner would work fine for you. People with hair that tangles at the drop of a hat, on the other hand? I recommend staying away, unless you're also planning to use a hair oil treatment every week!",
