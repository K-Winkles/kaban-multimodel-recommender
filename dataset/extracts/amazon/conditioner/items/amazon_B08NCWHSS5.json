It does not make hair feel heavy or limp. Probably that is because it does not contain silicones. No dinethicone which builds up and can't be removed through washing. I don't leave the conditioner on mire than one or two minutes. I had been using it along with the companion shampoo but now use it with a differeant shampoo meant fir sensitive skin. I found that the shampoo had amodimethicone, which caused limp hair. Also, it was making my scalp itch.
