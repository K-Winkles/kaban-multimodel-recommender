                "reviewText": "I like the scent of this conditioner and how it leaves my hair. My only complaint is the pump is too small for such a thick conditioner. A new design is badly needed for this. I was transferring some of the conditioner in the original bottle to a travel bottle and it took forever to do that due to the thickness of the conditioner. Fix the bottle design and this will be perfect in every way!",
