I was using head and shoulders for the longest time then decided to switch to garnier. Garnier began to give me dandruff, so I was looking for something better quality. I bought the shampoo and conditioner and used per directions. With my hair being so thick and long I do have to use more shampoo than expected. I love the way my hair smells and it doesn't give me dandruff. But it is dry. To me that just tells me hair is clean. I do follow up with their Argan Oil treatment. But if I don't, I can feel the dryness. Their argan def brings back the luster of my hair and the volume. Their purple bottle does make my hair feel clean and no dandruff so I'm not disappointed so far.",
