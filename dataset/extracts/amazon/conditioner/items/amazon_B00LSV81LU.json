                "reviewText": "Note: My hair texture is 3c/4a, low porosity, thin strands (but a lot of them), and is bra-strap length.I purchased this conditioner as a replacement for a discontinued product I used from a mainstream beauty supply store. The original conditioner had a simplistic ingredient list, no fragrance, and quickly absorbed into my hair.The Ginger Lily conditioner is a viable substitute - but keep in mind that I only intend to use this product as either a pre-washing treatment to soften my hair to aid the detangling process, or for when I use conditioner to \"wash\" my scalp in lieu of shampoo.For this purpose, it's a great product - it's efficient at providing a lightweight level of moisture (not to the same level as the product I'm replacing, though), without adding any weight or buildup.Having said that, I cannot imagine being able to use this conditioner as my primary conditioner as it doesn't provide enough of...I hate to say it, but anything. It doesn't provide enough penetrating and long-lasting moisture for protective and nourishing purposes. It definitely didn't provide enough slip for me to detangle my hair without causing damage.But the caveat is that my specific hair type simply needs a more of a powerhouse conditioner. That isn't to say that this product couldn't be viable for other hair types (such as straight), or hair that doesn't need as much moisture to keep it happy.For this conditioner's price point and volume of product, I'll definitely repurchase it because I go through A LOT of conditioner. But I'll make sure that my expectations for its usage is primarily geared toward my hair prep process, and not my hair maintenance process.",

                "reviewText": "After using this for about a month I have decided to not use this. I'll probably give it away to someone who doesn't have longer hair and it's too worried about moisturizing their hair.I have to use a heck of a lot more then other brands I have used in order to get a similar result. Even then, it's subpar. Unless you like the \"vegan\" and \"cruelty free\" aspects or if this happens to be the only stuff you can use due to a skin condition or something, I would recommend using something else.The savings from buying in bulk I think is offset from the cost of having to use handfuls of this stuff. I shampoo my hair, then condition and let the conditioner do it's job until I'm done showering then rinse the stuff out. That's my routine. I have to use about five times the normal amount to get anywhere close, and my hair cannot soak up anymore and I might as well be bathing in it. You would probably get better results putting olive oil in your hair, and you can buy that in bulk for the same price and use way less.Getting past the volume I have to use in order to compensate how poorly this does with my hair. The smell isn't that great. While I'm not one to really care about the fragrance products give off, I hate cologne and perfume, this stuff just doesn't smell \"clean\" if that makes sense. It would be like bathing in lake water, sure your clean but you probably don't smell good.If you have short hair and don't mind the smell, this might be the best stuff you can pick up and will last you.",
