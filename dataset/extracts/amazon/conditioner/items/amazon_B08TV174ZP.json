Die meisten Conditioner riechen nach Potpourri oder eindeutig zu weiblich f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack. Nichts f\u00fcr mich. Ich habe dann bei einem teuren Friseursalon den American Crew Conditioner ausprobieren k\u00f6nnen und war \u00fcberrascht wie toll sich dieser w\u00e4hrend der Benutzung aber auch noch danach anf\u00fchlt. Ich brauchte dieses Erlebnis unbedingt f\u00fcr zu Hause!Meine Haare f\u00fchlen sich seit dem nicht mehr so trocken an, sehen gesund und gl\u00e4nzend aus.Was gibt es \u00fcber diesen Conditioner noch zu sagen au\u00dfer, dass er das Haar wunderbar pflegt, richtig gut duftet? Der frische Kick auf den ich mich morgens fast schon am meisten freue ist ein Erlebnis das jeder mal gemacht haben sollte. Kaufempfehlung!",
