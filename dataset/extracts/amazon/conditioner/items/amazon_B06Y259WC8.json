Not only is the scent great, but it definitely helps get my hair clean, reduce grease, and increase the feel to my hair for a few days. I was having an issue with my hair getting too greasy almost the next day after washing it. After trying multiple different shampoos I decided to give this one a try and I'm happy to say I think I have found the shampoo for me. If you're looking for a quality shampoo to give it a chance, I would recommend you give this one a try!",

This shampoo looked cute so and had some really good ingredients for hair so I tried it out. It is AMAZING!! I absolutely love the smell and the way it makes my head feel so refreshed. Not only does it have great quality ingredients, I love how it smells and feels. The cap on it is also amazing. Shampoos and conditioners tend to break and get gross in the shower but the way they made these are super durable and easy to use!! They are a little bit small but I didn\u2019t have to use as much as I normally do because a little went a long way! Great product!",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Kristin Ess Hydrating Signature Sulfate-Free Salon Shampoo and Conditioner Set, and I have mixed feelings about it.On the positive side, the bottles look sleek and the packaging is attractive. The scent is pleasant, not too overpowering, and it lingers in your hair for a while after use, which I personally like. The sulfate-free formula is gentle on my hair and scalp, and I appreciate that it doesn't strip my hair of its natural oils.However, when it comes to performance, I found this set to be just okay. The shampoo lathers well, but I felt that it left my hair feeling a bit heavy and not as clean as I would have liked. The conditioner, while it has a nice texture, didn't seem to do a great job of detangling my hair, which was disappointing.In terms of hydration, I didn't notice a significant change in the overall moisture of my hair. I have naturally dry hair, and this set didn't seem to provide the deep hydration it claims. I had to use additional leave-in products to achieve the level of softness and manageability I desired.The price point is on the higher side for a drugstore brand, and I was hoping for better results given the cost. I've used other hydrating shampoos and conditioners that performed better at a similar or even lower price point.In conclusion, the Kristin Ess Hydrating Signature Sulfate-Free Salon Shampoo and Conditioner Set is decent, but it didn't quite meet my expectations in terms of hydration and overall performance. While it has some positive qualities, I may consider trying other products for better results in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Took multiple tries, but I have finally found a shampoo I love on Amazon! Kristen Ess' Signature Shampoo & Conditioner really is \"The One!\" The shampoo lathers up so well, and you really only need a small amount. I'm used to needing 3 tablespoons of shampoo to get a full lather, and with this shampoo you only need a tablespoon - maybe even less if you have shorter hair. The conditioner is nice too and my hair is soft, with little to no fly-aways - even in the dry winter air. I would have given this all 5 stars, but the smell is only so-so. If they came up with a nice fragrance this shampoo would be unmatched! One last point, I love the small compact bottle size. My shower is small so I don't have a lot of room for massive bottles. Don't let the small bottle size fool you. Because you only need a small amount of shampoo & conditioner this is still a very good value. I will be buying this product again, and in fact, this may be my go-to product of choice!",
