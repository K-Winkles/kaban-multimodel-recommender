I like it being soft, brushable, and feeling nice.I spent an eternity looking for products to use that will make my hair behave, because it really likes to just get wiry, or develop a random curl somewhere when exposed to heat or humidity and then get stuck permanently until I wash it. This stuff finally did the trick for me.And yes, got my haircut recently and the hairdresser was talking to the girl next to her and saying \"you can tell he takes really good care of it\" and \"come feel this boy's hair, like oh my god.\" and next thing I know I had three hairdressers tousling my head.Make of that what you will, but this stuff is 100% responsible.Can't say it'll work for everyone, but if you have thick, wavy hairs, try this stuff out!",
