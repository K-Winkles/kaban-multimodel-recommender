I was noticing so much brassiness from my regular conditioners. I was scared to use a blonde consirionwe because I have wavy hair prone to dryness, but after using my usual conditioner unfortunately I noticed so much brassiness developing so I tried this. I applied this today and the difference is like day and night. I cannot believe how much brass has been removed from my hair - it's the perfect ash like the box without the auburn tones I had before. I love the smell too - it reminds me of my lavender body lotion. And it's not drying at all. Will definitely re-buy!",

I used Brass Banisher, which did the immediate trick, but I knew follow through would be necessary. So I bought this, and it keeps things as they ought to be. The brassiness is gone. One word of advice: it says just to work the shampoo into a nice lather and rinse. The first time--a bit of red was creeping through. The second washing, I left it on 3 minutes, and I was back to where I wanted to be. So for more stubborn brass, leave this on for a bit. I wouldn't leave it on longer than 3 minutes because I am not sure what would happen.",

I should have taken those reviews that promised moisture lightly not knowing their hair types. I had to go heavily on my regular conditioner after washing this out, to prevent my hair from dying of thurst. It has a lavender smell which is a fragrance to each it's own, doesn't bother me, but I know some of the other reviews mentioned a smell... definitely adds that orange tone to your hair if that's what you're looking for, but be careful, it ended up turning my darker blondes a little too orange/gold for my liking and not really doing much to the ligher blondes which I wanted to bring down a notch. I want to give it another go and will try to post a photo of my hair afterwards, to show what I mean about my need for moisture. I decided to go with this after reading reviews on other products and they all seem to be really drying, I guess it comes with the territory, but this seemed to be the least drying of them all. If you have very course 3C or any 4 type hair I suggest pairing this with a conditioner that gives your hair what it needs or even doing a co-wash.",
