In fact, I started using Olaplex #3/6 to help with the issue and it wasn't making any difference. This product was recommended to me and after reading several reviews, I gave this a go and it's been great. Within 2 weeks, I've seen a big difference. Keep in mind, I also use the shampoo and the Olaplex products but what a difference. It lathers up beautifully. Smell great. My hair feels so soft and hydrated. A little goes a long way. I also notice that my hair isn't falling out as much...",

I still have more than half the bottle left and I bought this a few months ago! The 21 benefits spray is amazing also! I love that I made the switch.",
