Previously my hair was around 2B/2C wavy, and I needed to always use a gel to even get day 2 hair. It changed after adding this conditioner to my routine. It has lots of slip, detangles extremely well and is soooo moisturizing. Plus its protein free! Totally worth the money since the bottle does last me roughly 5 months, and I have to use a lot of it every time I wash because my hair is thick and coarse.",
