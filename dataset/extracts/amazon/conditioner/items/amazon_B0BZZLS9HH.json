Then I realized that this particular shampoo/conditioner made it so that I could comb through my tangled delicate hair without any breakage, even better if I let my hair dry before combing. So, I put up with the horrid smell. Funny thing, I seemed to get used to it. The other day I used a different shampoo and conditioner and I really feel like I miss the scent of this shampoo and conditioner! It makes your hair so soft and shiny and keeps it from breaking. It also gives enough volume for thin hair, without weighing it down. I now absolutely love it.",
