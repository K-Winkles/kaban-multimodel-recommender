I do not use any products with artificial fragrance in them, so I have tried many different \"natural\" brands that have simply not been moisturizing/detangling enough for my hair. This conditioner is the ONLY one I have found in stores that's ingredients meet my standards and detangle my hair! I use it as a shaving cream as well because of it's moisturizing effects. I have used this conditioner for over 2 years now. I will admit that the \"Vanilla Mint\" conditioner is the only one that has this effect on my hair. The other scents do not seem to be formulated the same, as they do not moisturize as well as this one does. The scent is so pleasant & light--& no artificial fragrance!! I highly, HIGHLY recommend Alaffia's \"Vanilla Mint\" conditioner for those who are looking for a conditioner that detangles and is one of the cleanest in stores!",

                "reviewText": "Lavander essential oil is clinically proven to regrow hair as well as 2.5% Minoxadil, and this conditioner contains large amounts of lavander essential oil. I soak it in from scalp and root to end and let it sit for a minuet or so before rinsing. The result is beautiful, soft and shiny hair. I have course, porus, wavy hair so this product may be better suited to that hair type which would make some sense as this is sometimes sold in the ethnic hair department of pharmacies. Nonetheless, I think it's a great product.I also like that it is Fair Trade Certified and that buying it supports living wages for the workers thst made it.",

I have very fine hair and had to give up all my plumping hair products. It turned out to be the best thing ever because I didn't need them using this product. I highlight and color my hair every 4 weeks and this conditioner has protected my hair. It is a great value, I am also saving money not buying the expensive hair products I had been using-like living proof and it's a 10. Great product, please keep selling it here.",

                "reviewText": "I have suffered from breakouts on my back almost my entire life. I have sensitive skin and I'm sensitive to fragrance. Those wonderful smelling shampoos and conditioners run down my back when I wash my hair causing breakouts in their path. Finally this conditioner solved that! But it's not the 1st fragrance free conditioner that I've tried. That's why I was still searching until now. This Alaffia conditioner is perfect for my slightly curly, color treated, fine hair. It gives just the right amount of moisture and shine without weighing my hair down. I pair it with my shampoo bar. I love Alaffia's other products too. For the 1st time ever I can shave with my conditioner because it's fragrance free and doesn't sting, itch or burn like others. If you've never shaved with conditioner you've got to try it! You will get an extremely close shave and it's super inexpensive.",
