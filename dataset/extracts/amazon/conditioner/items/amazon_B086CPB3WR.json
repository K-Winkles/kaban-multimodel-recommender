You save way more buying this than the smaller size, also the scent is perfect not overwhelming at all, smells lightly of coconut - like a vacation, so great if you're sensitive to scents, but this only works if you have normal slightly thick to thin hair that doesn't have build up. If you shower daily and don't have greasy hair this is perfect, it cleans just enough without being harsh.I buy this for my mom, it's perfect for her - it does NOT work for me, my hair is extremely thick and gets greasy very fast and since I use product to straighten it, this shampoo does nothing. Leaves behind all the buildup from product, so would not recommend for hair types like mines.",
