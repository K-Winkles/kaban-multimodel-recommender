All of that and I just realized that the large bottle lasted me literally an entire year!!! I had purchased the smaller sized bottle to trial it and when I decided that I liked it, I decided to get the larger size. The price was a little scary especially if you buy the shampoo too....but here we are literally one year later, I just came on to buy it again and realized the bottle lasted me from 15May 2022 to 10May 2023 (and there's still some left in the bottle). Also just for comparison, I probably wash my hair 5 of the 7 days of the week. Great product all around!",

It's very expensive, but I would've bought the shampoo and conditioner a long time ago had I known that it would make this much of a difference. It leaves my hair soft, silky, manageable and it smells great. Buy it today.",
