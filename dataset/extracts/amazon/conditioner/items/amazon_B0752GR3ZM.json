                "reviewText": "I have very thin, wispy hair. Flyaway and thinning on top with 0 natural volume.So far, this L'Or\u00e9al Paris Elvive Volume Filling product has been the best I've found. But, I'm all ears if there's something better out there! I use both the shampoo and the conditioner.This is affordable and I am not one to spend big bucks on shampoo/conditioner. However, if there were a miracle product for my hair, I would probably spend A LOT more. Glad I don't have to.To correct some answers asked about scent: YES! This conditioner and the shampoo are scented! I hate scents of most kinds, but I tolerate this for the benefits and it is not overpowering. I am very sensitive to scent, to the degree that no one in my household can use scented lotions/perfumes/laundry soap. However, I do tolerate this well enough with no adverse issues like itchy lips,eyes,runny nose, rash. Nothing.Tips for this conditioner: If you aren't using cool water to rinse, you're not going to get the full effect and you may have issues with your fine hair feeling weighed down! Since I do not care for cool water in the shower, this is what I do:1. Apply this cream rinse after rinsing out the shampoo with warm water.2. Comb through my hair to detangle3. Rinse out conditioner with my favorite warm temperature.4. Turn the water to the coolest I can tolerate (not cold), do a quick rinse.5. Turn the water back to warm to warm myself up.You will feel a DISTINCT difference in how much condition is coming out of your hair when you use cool water.For drying, I towel dry and really rub it all over pretty welll with the towel, especially at the scalp. Then I let it dry naturally...and messy. That helps give the appearance of more volume on top. It tames down after awhile and looks really nice for that first day. 2nd day is not too bad. After that, I have to wash and towel dry again to have any volume.",
