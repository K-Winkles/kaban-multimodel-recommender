I don\u2019t over easy my hair so I don\u2019t necessarily need to wash it very often because it doesn\u2019t get oily. I like this product because my hair feels silky smooth, it doesn\u2019t feel heavy, and I no longer have dry brittle ends. I have what you would call wavy hair so it\u2019s not curly, but it\u2019s not straight and this conditioner allows me to not have to style it and it looks super natural without it looking unhealthy. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I love this conditioner! It smells amazing, just a really lovely scent, like smelling the flowers and leaves in the air in a meadow (it\u2019s more natural, no fruity or fake smelling or powdery or overly perfume-y). And the conditioner works sooooo good. A little goes a long way too! I have long curly hair, which I will straighten every few days or so, and this conditioner works so well to moisturize and untangle my long curly hair and leaves is smooth and shiny, whether or not I leave it natural (smooth soft curls, nicely defined) or if I straighten it (smooth, flowy, and soft without fly aways). I think it is also sulfate free which is great because my skin gets really irritated and itchy when I use products with sulfates. It is, admittedly, a bit on the expensive side but you can really feel the difference when used compared to drug store shampoos and conditioners. My one gripe is that I wish the conditioner came in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid, like the shampoo, or a inverted squeeze bottle with the flip lid on the bottom, so I could more easily take it in my gym bag and traveling, etc. without worry the lid was going to come off (I do have a travel size of the shampoo and conditioner but the conditioner also had a jar/lid design that is just round vs square).Overall, I absolutely love this conditioner! Totally worth it!",
