The conditioner helps keep my hair looking healthy from all the damage, shiny, and soft. I use this every day after shampoo and it works well. I also like that it is light and doesn't weigh my hair down. However it is kind of liquidy so it is hard to control how much is coming out of the bottle, making you waste product.",

While I am amazed by the silky texture this achieves, I will say I noticed that when I air dry my hair it doesn\u2019t get nearly as smooth of a texture as when I blow dry it, and it tends to make my hair feel sticky by the next day. Blow drying is the trick for me! With blow drying I can go 2-3 days between washes with no frizz.",

I use the shampoo and conditioner and sometimes the dry shampoo and I now can make my hair last several days until my next wash. I am a girl who\u2019s scalp gets oily super fast but since I\u2019ve been using this brand and working on not washing as much, I now can extend my wash days to 4-5 days out, and I believe it\u2019s because of this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is growing back and feels so soft, and my last hair cut was in February. I use some other oils at the ends of my hair but I feel like my scalp is healthy and clean because of this shampoo and conditioner.I know it\u2019s expensive to purchase but if you can eventually get your wash days to 4-5 days out, it\u2019s not that bad. I wash my scalp twice with the shampoo, using quarter size portion, I like the foaming up feeling on my scalp. And after I use about 2 quarter size portions of conditioner and let it sit for at least a minute or 2. I also bought the larger shampoo and conditioner to fill up the bottles to help get more product out of the cost.",
