        "description": "The Dove Ultra Intensive Repair Shampoo and Conditioner system visibly repairs and restores damaged hair in just 30 seconds. Using only half of your usual dose, this ultra-fast detangle concentrated conditioner formula efficiently penetrates hair strands and delivers visible repair, restoring and shielding damaged hair in just 30 seconds. Brushing, heat and washing can damage hair and break essential hair bonds, resulting in dull and unmanageable hair. The conditioner for damaged hair formula helps to visibly repair and progressively nourish damaged hair with continuous use when used as a system, so you can help protect your hair against future damage with this nourishing conditioner. Dove Intensive Repair Conditioner, formulated with Bio-Nourish, helps your hair to recover from damage in two different ways. The formula repairs signs of surface damage, making your hair look and feel smooth and strong against breakage. By helping to reinforce your hair against breakage, it can also prevent the appearance of split ends and damage caused by coloring and heat styling. This hair conditioner for damaged hair contains 100 percent more Fiber Repair Activity per drop, provides 2X more washes and uses 50 percent less plastic per wash.* How to use the Dove Intensive Repair System: Step 1: Squeeze ONLY HALF of your usual dose (yes, that's enough) and massage the gel-like shampoo in wet hair. Step 2: After shampooing, squeeze ONLY HALF of your usual dose (yes, that\u2019s enough) and massage the gel-like conditioner as usual in wet hair. Step 3: Rinse and experience hair that feels stronger.*vs. non-concentrated Intensive Repair 20oz.",
