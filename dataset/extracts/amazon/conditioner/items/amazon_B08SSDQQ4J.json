My hair went from a bale of hay due to a blotched balayage job to feeling like Farrah Fawcett in 72 hours. My hair feels thicker and the texture is almost where it was before I sat in bleach for two hours. The conditioner is light with a nice scent and made my locks silky smooth. If you are considering this or just scrolling by, put it in your cart. It will save your hair and mend your heart.",
