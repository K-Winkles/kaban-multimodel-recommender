I am happy this one does not burn my head and it smells good too. It does add a shine to my hair as well. This is the first hair product in my life I have ever gotten excited about and to use. Will be sticking with this conditioner. Have used it since october 25th and still continue to do so and it is November 10th. I didn't want to write a review until I gave it a fair chance. I don't have issues getting it out of the bottle and it was packaged fine with no issues, thankfully since I did have other orders in the box it came with.",
