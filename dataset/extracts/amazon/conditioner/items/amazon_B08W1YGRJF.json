                "reviewText": "Ryo seems to have changed the formula for this conditioner in addition to the bottle design. I have been using this line of Ryo since the early days of the pandemic, when my American style shampoo started drying out my scalp. I have been a big fan ever since - the quality was great, did not dry out my scalp, and did not irritate my skin overall (I have eczema and some products are irritating). This new formula is very different from the old conditioner; its thick and gloopy like cheap drugstore shampoo and does not smell like ginseng. While wet, my hair did not feel smooth at all, it felt tangled as if I had not even used conditioner. After blowdrying, my hair did become softer but my scalp felt tight and itchy. I have never had that kind of response to Ryo before. Please bring back the old formula!!",
