I had hoped it wouldn't suds up as much as most shampoos, but it doesn't really matter that it does. Washes out cleanly. Very good for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I love this shampoo! Just bought it for the first time a month ago and I'm hooked. I prefer shampoos that also work well as a body wash, and this one does. It is really moisturizing and makes my skin feel great. I wear my hair very short, so I don't know how it is with long hair, but for me this leaves my hair and body clean and moisturized. The smell is also fantastic. It has a fresh, sweet, coconut fragrance in the shower, but doesn't leave you smelling like a coconut after the shower. I shampoo everyday, but rotate between a few different shampoos to prevent a build-up. This is a great addition to my rotation.",

It left my skin moisturized and \"comfortable\" (winter makes my \"over 60\" skin dry and uncomfortable). Once I used it I expected it to weigh my hair down--but it doesn't. It leaves it soft and light. Since I couldn't decide whether to use it as a shampoo or body wash, I simply decided to use it as both...and love it. I really like this product...!

                "reviewText": "I used to represent a fairly large hair care brand and overtime started to recognise what ingredients do what in a product. Now for the squeamish there\u2019s an ingredient that some people can have an allergic reaction too, though it\u2019s fairly low down the list which is called Diazolidinyl urea. It\u2019s a formaldehyde, though it\u2019s widely used in beauty product as an anti microbial. If that\u2019s a worry then this is not for you, however I\u2019m ok with living dangerously. I like a lot of OGX shampoos but this one tends to put moisture where you don\u2019t need it which is closer to the scalp and none where you do need it which is on the ends of your hair. I suspect any porosity in your hair can\u2019t hold it and it rinses out. I\u2019ve got pretty fine hair and prefer the roots of my hair to be pretty squeaky clean to get some root lift which this doesn\u2019t achieve. Of course it smells nice, but that\u2019s about all I like. I\u2019d say if you got pretty healthy medium straight hair this may be worth trying.",

I have oily fine and thin hair and this shampoo cuts the oil without drying my hair. It feels like it has conditioner innit yet my hair is still full and not weighed down. Very little tangling andvi hope they keep making it. Love the smell too.",
