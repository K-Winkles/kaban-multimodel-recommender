When I put it on my hair, the perfumey smell was almost overwhelming. This conditioner worked wonders for my hair, but I would not recommend it for anyone sensitive to smells.",

                "reviewText": "I have very fine hair and was in the market for a shampoo and conditioner that didn't weigh my hair down. This stuff is amazing for my fine hair and it leaves behind a luxurious scent that has lasted days in my hair. I am someone who cannot stand smelling bad and now I never have to worry about my hair getting that \" dirty hair smell\" a day or two after washing. I have also been able to stretch out my hair wash days to just twice a week (for someone with fine, thin, oily hair, this is a huge step). The only caveat I have with this product is that the conditioner is not super moisturizing. It makes my hair a little soft if I leave it on for a few minutes. This is the downside of using products formulated for thin hair. We need the volume and added moisture tends to weigh our hair down. However, I have started using a weekly hair mask that has combatted this problem.Overall, I have never used a shampoo or conditioner that has had such a powerful lasting scent on my hair like this one. I catch myself smelling my hair throughout the day because it is so addicting!",

The packaging is pretty, the conditioner was a good consistency (will update once I\u2019ve used the product more than once). The reason for my 3 stars is the scent. Dang\u2026. Pow! Bing! Bam! That\u2019s a strong, granny, powdery, floral scented soap smell. Wow!\u2026. Just wow\u2026. Whoever decided to go with this fragrance should rethink what they do for a living. I think if it wasn\u2019t so strong I might\u2019ve tolerated it. Maybe if I see great results I will change my star rating, but tbh I won\u2019t be buying this product again once it\u2019s finished because I cannot stand this smell.",
