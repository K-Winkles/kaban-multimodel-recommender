                "reviewText": "Here is the truth. I don't write many reviews. I was looking forward to a new shampoo and conditioner. One that smelled great, worked well and didn't cost a fortune.The smell is good. It didn't last long after like I was hoping. Not a big deal. I only bought the conditioner to try first before getting the shampoo too. That might make a difference on the longevity of the smell.It gives a nice clean feel. The main problem is that it leaves my hair tangled as if I didn't use any conditioner. My hair is baby fine. Maybe it works better on different type of hair? I use a detangler after and that solved it. Then use a leave in conditioner once a week.I didn't tell my husband I switched conditioner. I refilled our bottle with a pump. After a few times using it. He made the comment to me the conditioner didn't work as well as it was. I didn't even ask him. After I told him I had switched, he said \"He felt it didn't moisturize it and left it tangled\".I hope this helps anyone who is thinking about it. If your hair doesn't have an issue tangling, then give it a try. If it does this isn't for you. I am going to try the bodywash. I did like the smell.",

                "reviewText": "But this product was genuinely just not what I was hoping and expecting it would be.I use a ton of conditioner. Recently upon searching \u201cbulk conditioner\u201d on here I happened upon this product.\u201cOmg! Perfect! Great price, cruelty free, massive amount, a scent I was sure to like. This is perfect!\u201d, I thought. And the company seems really cool, ethical, etc.It arrived exactly as expected and WOW the smell was great! I was actually excited to use it. Well\u2026 unfortunately it fell really flat of what I was expecting based on all the great reviews.I shampooed and rinsed my hair, then slathered the ponytail sections with a handful of this conditioner to let it work it\u2019s magic while I completed the rest of my shower tasks. Towards the end of my shower, I began to run my fingers through the ends to detangle my hair before rinsing. To my surprise, the tangles weren\u2019t budging. My hair felt dry and knotted, as if I\u2019d used no conditioner at all. I added some more and tried to detangle\u2026 nothing. It was like the more I added, the more tangled and dry it became. It felt as though my hair had been soaked in pool water.Eventually I gave up, rinsed it out, and concluded my shower.I could not believe the condition my hair was in. It was a veritable birds nest. It felt \u201cchemical-y\u201d, dry, damaged, and as if it could snap and break. Like I said earlier: that feeling of soaking one\u2019s hair all day in highly chlorinated pool water.I had to use like 1/4 cup of leave in conditioner to get the tangles out. I ended up ripping out a LOT of hair in the process. Thankfully Amazon is letting me return it.In summation, I feel bad leaving this rating. The company seems lovely- good values, an array of products, and cruelty free which is very important to me as a consumer.This conditioner just ain\u2019t it though. Maybe I got an unusually bad batch, but my hair caught some damage and ended up worse after using this product sadly.",
