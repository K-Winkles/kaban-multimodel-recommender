                "reviewText": "I originally purchased the entire Old Spice thickening system (steps 1,2, and 3). I started experiencing some thinning on two areas of my scalp. I've been using the system for about 4 months now. I've been told by others that my hair looks thicker and healtherier. I think the areas that were thinning are filling back in but I prefer to ask someone else to look. As for the conditioner itself I like it. The scent is not heavy or overpowering. It immediately starts conditioning my hair upon application. I can feel snarls smooth out right away. It rinses out very easily. It doesn't leave any residue after my hair drys. It is more expensive than a lot of the brands you buy at the big box stores but not near as pricey as some of the designer brands. I'm satisfied with the mid price point. Summing up, if you only used this conditioner as a conditioner I think you would be very satisfied. As a hair thickening system I believe the system works very well but you do have to be willing to invest the time and not expect big results overnight.",

I have naturally thick hair so I do not necessarily use this product for hair thickening, nor have I seen any difference in hair thickness after over a year of use. This conditioner is great for keep hair moisturized and is a far better option to a typical shampoo & conditioner combination. I use this product once per day and it lasts me weeks before I need a refill. I\u2019ve found it incredibly rare to find in store so being able to order this to arrive the next day is one of the things continuing to bring me back.",

Worthy of five stars.Except...The container is shaped like a giant toothpaste tube -- and has the same problems. After a couple of uses, it becomes very difficult to squeeze out more. It's also hard to hold onto in the shower because you have to grasp the container above where the stuff that's still inside is located, and the skinny top is very slippery when wet.If I didn't like the product itself as much as I do, I wouldn't buy it again for that reason. So take a pass if you're not interested in having to deal with an awkwardly-shaped container while showering.",
