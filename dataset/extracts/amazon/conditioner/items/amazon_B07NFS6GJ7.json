I started using this conditioner in addition to the rinse-out conditioner about 7 years ago and still love it. It is very inexpensive and works great. I use a large-tooth comb and spray this in my hair and can get through he tangles in a minute or so. My hair is a little past my shoulder blades in length and baby fine but not thin. This is a good addition because it is light enough to leave in without making my hair feel weighed down but still detangles and adds some moisture.It also smells great. A light coconut smell that reminds me of being on the beach.Highly recommend.",

I like how the spray is controlled. Each press of the nozzle button sends a very small spray out so it's extremely easy to control how much you are applying to your hair. The formula is not a heavy moisturizing one, it just detangles and leaves a little bit of something on the hair. I am retired and am not on any sort of schedule so I have the luxury of time. After I wash my hair I towel dry it then use this spray and let it air dry. I don't try to comb it out until it's dry.",
