So it is important to me to purchase products that I feel good about and are safe for my children. It's hard to find a conditioner that actually detangles her hair. I have gone through sooooo many products. I found only two conditioners I absolutely loved and this is one of them! Loved it so much I bought this big 33oz for my shower, lol!",

Let me start off by saying that I am an African American woman with 4b relaxed hair. I had been looking for an organic conditioner. And let me just say I love this conditioner. On my first use my hair was super soft and detangling was a breeze for my bra strap length hair. Yep-no tangles and the days following I was able to tell that my hair was still well moisturized. I did not need as much product for my daily moisturizing and sealing. Saving to splurge on this product will be a definte for me, but I will do whatever it takes to make this a staple!! Original Sprout 33 oz Deep Conditioner is a God send!",

I use it all the time even after the shower it helps to comb it through. Doesn\u2019t dry out your hair. My only one request would be is to have an extra pump they always break then it\u2019s hard to use. It last me about two to three months.",

                "reviewText": "Good conditioner, but not as \"deep conditioning\" as we needed it to be. If you have normal hair, this would work as a deep conditioner. For my daughter though, who is half African American and half Caucasian, it did not work well enough. I had to use lots of it, and in combination with olive oil. Since finishing the bottle we have used mixed chicks products, which also weren't saturating her hair well. Finally, we found in the ethnic isles the brand SheaMoisture. They have a kids line, carrot&mango extra-nourishing that REALLY does the trick! I've tried a couple other conditioners as well and that one is the best for getting knots out and really saturating thick, dry hair.",

                "reviewText": "Love this conditioner on my daughters curly hair. It's normally a nightmare to work with and we've recently started following the curly girl routine where we don't use shampoo but do a co-wash instead followed by conditioner. It uses a lot of conditioner. A lot. \ud83d\ude00 This is a huge bottle, lovely pump dispenser which makes it easy to use in the shower or bath which is especially handy when working with a reluctant 3 year old. It has a fairly light, fresh fragrance which is quite pleasant but different to the average children's chemical smelling products. Her hair is far less tangled after using this, but I still use their detangling spray daily as well. I'm really pleased with the conditioner.",
