I tried many products, wasted alot of money as well, until I found Loreal shampoo and conditioner. No, it's not salon quality, but it's the closest I've found on a tight budget.",

                "reviewText": "A lot off people done know that L'Or\u00e9al is actually produced by the same manufacturers as the big expensive brands. This shampoo is no exception. It smells salon good and is thick and rich great for men or women. The smell reminds me of an expensive salon, it's truly invigorating! It is the smell of luxury and quality that will last all day. Make sure that you properly rinse your hair out if using the conditioner, it can be a bit heavy for men with short hair. Overall this is a solid \"W\"",

                "reviewText": "I have fine hair and have been trying to find a good shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years after one i previously used was discontinued. This lathers so well and my hair feels very clean after shampoo, but not dry or stringy. The conditioner makes my hair feel super soft. I've been using this for a few months now and I do feel that my hair is healthier and more moisturized. As mentioned, I have fine hair and this definitely isn't doing anything for volume, but I'd rather have it feel and look healthy and add my own volume.",
