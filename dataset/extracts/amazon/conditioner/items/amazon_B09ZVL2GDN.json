(Blonde, Fine, Medium thickness, long)I was on narcotics for years for a chronic pain condition from which I\u2019m still struggling. The narcs played havoc with my once thick hair and I wanted to see if I could repair some of the damage. My beautician says this is working. I\u2019ve got hair growing most noticeable on the front of my hairline causing stray insubordinate pieces to poke out when back in a pony tail. Lol. I\u2019m also scent sensitive and this doesn\u2019t bother me. It smells so good. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. Both the shampoo and conditioner wash out clean leaving no nasty residue on the hair. I just bought my second set. I\u2019m very happy with this product and have told friends about it.",
