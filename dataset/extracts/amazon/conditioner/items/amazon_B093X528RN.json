I am seriously so impressed I have never had a conditioner replace a smoothing serum. my husband also used it and has typically dry hair with some dry scalp and I have not seen any flakes and his hair is super soft as well (not saying this is a cure for scalp issues it just worked for him)",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying several conditioners the past few months to see which ones will actually DO SOMETHING for my dry hair. I've got thick hair, it's wavy, and I have recently gone back to heat styling and wanted something that would help to combat the possible damage from that among other things. Keeping hair moisturized is very important obviously. And this conditioner, compared to all others I've tried, has done a decent job of that.It doesn't cling to my hair like a lot of other conditioners do, washes off easily. I'd definitely say it feels silky right after washing it off and it doesn't weigh the hair down even though the conditioner itself feels quite concentrated. Comparing the amount of frizz I normally get to the amount I get using this conditioner is also relatively impressive. I've got frizz naturally and yet with this conditioner it feels like that amount has reduced by a noticeable amount. Also, I am not noticing nearly as many split ends as I'd normally see with heat styling. Maybe that's thanks to the deep conditioning and the heat protectant, but I'd attribute the success to the only consistent factor here: The conditioner.I haven't gone through the full bottle yet and It's been almost a month already, so for the amount you get, the price is also quite reasonable. Obviously my hair has not transformed completely, and it can still be quite unpredictable. But the overall experience I've had with this conditioner has been quite positive. I feel as though I've finally found a conditioner that actually does at least a quarter of what it claims on the packaging. Do plan on keeping this in my routine.",
