Free from parabens, dyes and silicones and enriched with a botanical blend, our professional-quality formula simultaneously nourishes and moisturizes each time you lather up for healthy looking hair.

Then squeeze a generous amount of TRESemme Botanique Nourish & Replenish Conditioner into palms and rub hands together. Apply to damp hair, focusing on ends to mid-lengths first, and then work any remaining conditioner up toward the roots. Leave in 2-3 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Follow with TRESemme Botanique Collection treatment products to maximize nourishment and add moisture. The TRESemme Botanique Nourish & Replenish system, infused with coconut milk and aloe vera, simultaneously smooths and silkens for healthy-looking hair.
