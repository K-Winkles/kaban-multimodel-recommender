                "reviewText": "A few things: I don\u2019t know about reducing breakage because I only began using this product this week so that remains to be seen. The strong perfume smell did take me by surprise, and I admit I didn\u2019t look at the ingredients list until my first use and realizing the perfume-y scent from this was so strong (I work in health care, and don\u2019t wear perfume-y stuff because of my patients). Also, I have a lot of long, thick hair, but it is very prone to breakage. Buuuut, upon applying this conditioner, it was so thick and luxurious, and I was able to comb through my wet hair in the shower incredibly easy with little product, I honestly could not believe it. I have never used a product that could detangle my hair with such ease unless I globbed it on.MY HAIR ACTS YOUNG AGAIN, if that makes any sense. It has the body and bounce it had when I was in my early 20s. I\u2019m in my mid 30s now and have been disappointed in the change in my hair over time. This product literally changed my hair back to its golden days in one use!Yes, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars, but this is because the perfume smell is so strong and unnecessary, and yes, it\u2019s one of the first ingredients, which I really feel takes away from the quality of this product. Nothing but actual perfume needs to smell this strong, so I hope the makers of this product consider at least toning it down. But also I want to tell the makers THANK YOU for making this stuff! I could cry having my old hair back, I\u2019m so grateful!",

                "reviewText": "This products is the best I have used for my hair. I actually have straight hair and I use this product. This was given to me from a friend who can be sensitive to scents. My hair was brittle, lifeless and breaking prior to using the product. I think my hair is feelings better than it has in months. I ran out of the conditioner and was using Biology and my hair started feeling dry and brittle again. So I ordered this again and have decided that I will not be without this shampoo and conditioner ever again. The scent is a very mild scent. I can be sensitive to scents (especially if they are floral) but this shampoo and conditioner doesn't bother me at all. I love the smell of the shampoo and condition and I love how they leave my hair feeling when I use them. This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner so far. TRUST me..... I am over 50 and I have tried several brands and kinds of shampoos and conditioners. Both from professional salons and off the shelf. This is by far my favorite.",
