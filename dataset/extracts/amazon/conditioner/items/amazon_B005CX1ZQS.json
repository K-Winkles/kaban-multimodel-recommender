Perfect for curly or straight hair. Makes blow outs wayy faster without looking greasy or losing volume. It gives u bouncier softer fuller hair while de- frizing after 1st wash. Works best to leave on 10mins and come thru.. my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive ( to me I'm on low budget) . Look for sales ..deals..",
