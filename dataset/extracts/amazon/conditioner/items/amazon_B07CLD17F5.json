The refreshing scent of hydrating coconut water and sweet lime lifts your mood as well as leaves your hair refreshed with every wash.

                "reviewText": "Dove always comes through!!This conditioner is unreal for the price. I have fine, thin hair and I love switching up my shampoo/conditioner a couple times per week. I wash my hair a lot in the summer because I work out and I can count on this Shampoo/Conditioner combo to really clean my scalp and clean out any hair products that I have in. It's unbelievable that I get so much product for this price. Thanks, Dove!",

Really glad I did - love the smell (not overpowering), and makes my hair super soft and easy to comb through, which is no easy feat because my hair is very very long.",
