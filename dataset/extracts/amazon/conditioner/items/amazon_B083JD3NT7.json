It is good for travel because it serves all these purposes without all the bottles. Of course, it is excellent for its intended use, which is to condition and detangle the hair. I like its coconut scent, which is subtle enough for me. When I use it as a leave-in, it does not flake and provides definition for my hair too, so it can be used as a styler if I'm pulling my hair back. If I'm using it as a styler and my hair is loose, I put a gel on top for hold. It works well with other styling products.",

Years ago I tried to use this conditioner as a detangler, but it seemed to aid in the tangles, but in recent years I\u2019ve also learned that for my hair less is more. I no longer an heavy handed with products, layer or use oil on my hair ( just scalp). This conditioner with water melts my tangles away and moisturizes my hair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be without it! I\u2019ve spent hundreds trying to find products that work. I\u2019ve use drugstore products as well as salon. I\u2019m now at the point I will use what works for MY hair and not jump on the newest trend. The conditioner is thick and a little goes a long way. I found that it is best when activated with water. It\u2019s cost effective and it works!",

                "reviewText": "I have really long hair and tend to use a *lot* of conditioner in the shower. I\u2019m always looking for less expensive products that still work well since getting the fancy stuff is just way too much money given the quantity that I\u2019m using on a regular basis. This is one of my favorite brands/products that I\u2019ve found in my years of experimenting, and definitely the best value-for-price option; in my experience it\u2019s better than the other brands I\u2019ve tried at the same price. It might not make my hair quite as soft & smooth as some of the slightly more expensive products, but it works well enough that most of the time I would rather have this for the lower price, especially with my thrifty-college-student budget. There was a while I couldn\u2019t find it in stores and I\u2019m super happy I\u2019ve found it on Amazon, and in the large container version too!",
