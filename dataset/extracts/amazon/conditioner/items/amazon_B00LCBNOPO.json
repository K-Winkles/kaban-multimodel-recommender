                "reviewText": "Is it worth the high price? I decided to splurge on myself and I\u2019m a changed woman. This stuff is legit. People have said \u201cyour hair looks healthier\u201d \u201cdid you get a haircut?\u201d \u201cyour hair is so soft\u201d \u201cwow you smell good\u201d all thanks to this shampoo and conditioner. I have fine, frizzy, bleached at home hair that I\u2019m trying to grow out. This makes my hair soft and shiny. It also is the best product I\u2019ve tried at making my oily scalp feel clean. It doesn\u2019t do much for my frizz issue (a light hair oil solves that though). Shipped fast and in good condition. The shampoo and conditioner come in their own packaging, a thin cardboard box, and that is mailed in the classic Amazon envelope. I didn\u2019t have issues with leakage like some other reviewers, but these do not come with a seal so that is always a possibility. If you have a little extra money and want to pamper yourself, I recommend trying it\u2026 but you might get hooked and seriously consider spending big $$$ on shampoo and conditioner here on out!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very torn because for this amount of money, to get such a small amount (not even 8oz) is obscene. It also has a terrible perfume smell that if you\u2019re sensitive to smell is very hard to tolerate. But it\u2019s a really good conditioner aside from that. Incredibly moisturizing. It would be perfect if it was just a big bigger and stank less",
