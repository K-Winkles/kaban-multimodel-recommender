It has become a staple conditioner for me now.When I was on the lookout of sulphate free shampoos and silicone-free conditioners about 2 years back, there were only few options available in India. I picked up this one then.A lot of buzz is going on now regarding sulphates and silicones. I would say, if you want to try it out, this one is a good option if your budget allows.I have not-so-thick curly hair. This one works well for detangling in the shower. Might not be the most moisturising of all, but for me this suffices for now, until I find a better conditioner.I have seen mixed reviews here. While I cannot speak for everyone, but I think it is one of the best options among silicone free conditioners in India, especially if you are looking for something good for detangling in the shower itself. Provides decent slip. Straight haired might not need this, but it is a good option for curly hair.Once you are half way through with the conditioner, it's wiser to store it upside down as getting the conditioner out of the bottle can really be chore then.",
