We bought it months ago and still have the same bottle.Our little is 2 so washing her hair and then conditioning is a fight so I just add a little bit to her shampoo when I\u2019m washing her hair and it smells amazing and makes her hair extremely soft! I pair it with suave coconut 3 in 1 for kids and it\u2019s the best combo for us.",
