                "reviewText": "This is my first time trying the Pro Pure Damage Recovery conditioner. I am VERY picky about conditioners because they 1) either weigh my fine hair down so much that it looks incredibly flat and/or greasy or 2) they do not easily rinse out of my hair.I was interested to try this product since it doesn't contain any sulfates, parabens, mineral oil, etc.The conditioner is average in thickness, a bit lotiony in texture, and is easy to spread through my hair. I apply from mid length to ends, rarely on the top of my head unless my hair is INCREDIBLY dry and brittle. You immediately get that slick, slimy feeling on your hair when applying which quickly goes away after rinsing. I LOVE that this conditioner rinses easily without leaving behind any unwanted residue. My hair is left feeing soft, silky, and manageable.The fragrance is very pleasant - light, fresh, and a bit floral. It smells nice in the shower but doesn't linger long on my hair after drying. It has that traditional TRESemm\u00e9 fragrance that I have always loved!It pairs quite nicely with the Pro Pure Damage Recovery shampoo. They compliment each other well.I don't have severely dry or damaged hair so this conditioner was just right for me. It provided the perfect amount of moisturization and left my hair feeling super silky, soft, and tangle free without feeling coated or weighed down. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "Another amazing conditioner, courtesy of TRESemme!This sulfate free conditioner works great on my natural curly, wavy hair. My hair is normally dry, but drier than usual during winter months with the heat running in the house 24/7. This conditioner hydrates and moisturizes while keeping my curls and waves soft and smooth, ridding my hair of flyaways as well. When I sweat, my hair frizzes and looks like a pile of out of control Ramen noodles. lol. Needless to say, the other day I moved furniture all around and did some spring cleaning. I worked up a sweat. Using TRESemme's Pro Care Curls conditioner the night before, prevented my hair from frizzing and turning into a pile of out of control Ramen noodles. Its a wonderful conditioner-easy to apply to hair and just as easy to rinse out. It does not weigh hair down or make it look/feel oily or greasy. It has a fabulous scent as well though not long lasting. (at least not in my hair) This conditioner works wonders on curly, wavy hair and I absolutely recommend it. The price can't be beat either!",
