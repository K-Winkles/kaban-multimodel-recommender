                "reviewText": "Third time is a charm! I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner in citrus, rosemary and now the coconut. I really liked the citrus. The smell was light. Shampoo lathered ok and the conditioner was good. I was running low and decided to try the rosemary. I really liked the scent of the shampoo but the conditioner had very little scent. I wasn't sure I liked it as well as the citrus but I really came to like it as well as the citrus. Third time I bought the coconut. This one is the true winner. Shampoo lathers wonderfully and the conditioner is the easiest to apply of the three scents. The true difference is that this one works best on my hair. I have very fine straight color treated hair which tangles easily especially at night. First time using and I woke up with tangle free hair. All of the shampoo and conditioner are a good size. Roughly the size of a palm. I find that both run out around the same time with washing my hair almost every day. Approximately 3 months. The only issue I have is that when the bars get about 2/3 gone they start to crumble. I just softened them up like you would chocolate in a double boiler and poured them in a silicone ice cube tray and was able to completely use up all the bars. The only thing I would like is for the coconut to come in a set like the citrus and rosemary.",

                "reviewText": "I just bought the conditioner bar the rosemary mint. I used the conditioner bar last night with the little bit of my ethique shampoo bar that\u2019s left. So far I haven\u2019t found a conditioner bar I\u2019m in love with. I have thicker wavy hair that I get a lot of blonde highlights in. This conditioner bar applied much easier than others I\u2019ve tried and didn\u2019t take nearly as much work to get it distributed through my hair. I left it on for about 3-5 minutes and as I washed it out my hair felt very soft (this has not been the case with other conditioner bars so far). After I towel dried my hair I applied a little bit of the conditioner through my hair as a leave in and let it dry overnight. My hair is super soft this morning but still bouncy and not weighed down and a ton of my natural waves are showing. I also really liked the scent and definitely felt some minty tingle in the shower which I like. I will update my review as I use this more if needed. Since I\u2019m almost out of my current shampoo bar I bought the rosemary mint shampoo bar from this brand to try them together. I get itchy dry scalp with many shampoos, so I will definitely report back after I\u2019ve been using both these products. But so far, this conditioner bar has worked the best out of others I\u2019ve tried (ethique, viori, and one other that I got on amazon I can\u2019t remember the brand). Hope I keep getting this soft and bouncy results as I keep going\u2026.cause I will be a repeat customer if so. Oh also great packaging, no plastic etc.",

                "reviewText": "My husband says my hair smells exactly like lemon Pledge furniture dust-removal spray. Now that he has said that, it's the only thing I think of when I catch a whiff. NOT what I would choose! If you love that scent, this is for you. (I'd give you mine, even.)That said, my hair tends to feel a bit course and dry, tending to have split ends. My hair is very soft after using this conditioner bar. I have brown hair with copperish highlights that curls into loose springs, or frizzes to rival Einstein's hair texture on bad days. No frizzies this morning after my shower last night. However, the copper shine is not there. My hair doesn't feel heavy at all, but that bright luster isn't there. It does still have a softer sheen.The smell is the deal breaker for me. When using it, it smells very strongly airfreshener lemon, with an undertone of pot. Like a lemon Hi-Chew candy. The pot undertone disappears when the hair is dry, and the lemon scent fades a lot.The feel is very invigorating! It's almost a light mentholated feeling. I shower at night, so this also doesn't work for me. If you are looking for a conditioner that also helps wake you up, this is awesome! Throw this in your gym bag!All in all, if this company could make a more subtle scent and eliminate the menthol feeling, I would be back in a heartbeat! (Can I suggest German chamomile; the fresh crushed plant scent, not a tea; with a hint of Earl Gray tea scent, minus the tannic bit. It would really match with your product in a great way. And it would still be a gender neutral scent.)Please? And thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I was previously using the Super Zero shampoo/conditioner bars, which was my first venture into bars. I loved the results with those but the condition was so hard to apply, it just never felt like it was coating my hair and I wound up using it up fast because I was actually using so much. Then, when it got low, it would break apart into smaller pieces which was strangely better. I set out for something better and found this. It smells amazing, very natural and invigorating. It coats the hair so easily and feels instantly moisturizing. My hair feels great and it doesn\u2019t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin/scalp. I will absolutely buy more and look forward to trying the shampoo too.",
