                "reviewText": "The best part about this conditioner is a little goes a LONG way. It does not weigh my fine hair down. The even BIGGER plus to this conditioner is it NEVER makes my face break out or my neck. I have to be very careful with shampoos and conditioners. The down side is you absolutely need to find a pump to work with this bottle because it is fairly thick consistency and a total pain in the ass to squeeze out of a bottle this size. Also when you think it is empty, cut the bottle in half so you can scrape out the rest. There will be a TON of product left at the bottom. I've been through numerous bottles and I always go back to this conditioner.",

As I'm growing out my highlighted hair to it's natural silver gray, I wanted something which wouldn't strip the color still in there, and help restore any imbalance to the cuticle of the hair shaft. It seems to work very well, and the fragrance is soft & lovely. (not overpowering!) I'd definitely recommend it.",
