This works for all ethnicities.If your little one has the type of curly hair on the thicker side that gets dry and matted up easily, then you should use this more as a leave in conditioner with a spritz of water and then twist/braid the hair till dry.But other than that, it works well with all hair types as a good baby conditioner.",

                "reviewText": "I've been searching high and low for a natural alternative, and I finally found the very best leave-in conditioner for my 3yr old. Her hair reaches the small of her back and she can't stand to have her hair brushed, much less after washing it when it's tangled. This conditioner makes her hair so slick, the tangles just slip through the brush. I use essential oils daily for my own homemade products, and the lavendar in this conditioner smells like genuine lavendar. I have very long, coarse, curly hair and I've been a WEN girl for years, but I'm using this now. My hair so soft and smells so good!",

                "reviewText": "It contains lavender. Yes, a flower (with pollen) that a lot of people are allergic to. So, for being mislabeled, this product gets one less star. That being said, it is darned good conditioner, and only makes my scalp itch a little bit (which is more than I can say for 99% of all conditioners out there).My hair is hopelessly, un-manageably curly. Not \"just wash it once a week and you'll be fine\" curly; it's \"it starts turning into dread locks if I don't use conditioner for two days\" curly. Oh, and while it's turning into dread locks, what isn't knotting together is frizzing out into a white 'fro. It just isn't the look I'm going for. So, I tried this conditioner, and it does two amazing things:1. It de-tangles my hair, so I don't have to spend an hour in front of a mirror trying to get the knots out. (It now takes about 10 minutes.)2. It weighs down my hair so that instead of turning into ringlets + frizz, it becomes mostly ringlets, which I like.My hair still gets unmanageable after two days or so, but for those two days, but getting it manageable, again, is far less of a chore, and it looks better between washings than it used to. With a slightly itchy scalp (grrrr).",

I\u2019ve used lots of conditioner from Loreal to expensive pureology but this conditioner has been the best. It really detangles! I can easily brush my long hair. I don\u2019t recommend applying this on your scalp because it can make your hair flat. Apply it from the chin down only.",

I didn\u2019t even realize this was made for infants as well but to my surprise the first night I used it it was fantastic. I never knew conditioner could make your hair feel so light weight. I was so used to using junk all my life my hair felt weighted down and HEAVY! I will never go back. I love this conditioner. My hair has never felt so soft and so light. And to my surprise it gave me a ton of volume. For the first time in over 15 years I feel like I have my natural hair back! So happy!!!!",

It is free of major allergens like wheat/gluten, nuts, and soy - which is very hard to find. It has a nice mild scent. It does well to detangle, and I've seen an improvement in split-ends & breakage in both of my daughter's hair that are using it. The awesome surprise is that we can use this as a leave-in or wash it out. It works great both ways! I thought that was great, because often leave-in conditioner gives your hair a dirty look and strange coated feel. I would have given it 5-stars if it was actually a natural conditioner. Alas, they've just added some essential oils and called it \"natural\". If you're looking for a truly natural personal care product to avoid ingredients like lauryls & benzotes then this may not be the one for you. The conditioner rates a 3 on EWG when I looked it up. That being said I would buy it again, because it's one of the best balanced options I've seen out there.",
