I have hip-length spiral curly hair and I use A LOT of daily-use conditioner, so I thought I would give this product a try because of the value, the amount in each unit, and the mostly good reviews that I read. I am happy to report that this product as a daily conditioner/leave-in conditioner for me has worked beyond my expectations. I noticed the difference after the first use, and each use thereafter increased the results of greater softness and manageability. I recommend this product as a quality, low-cost hair conditioner that is perfect for daily conditioning purposes.",

This conditioner does a nice job of reducing the frizz, making the hair feel softer and reducing its volume without making it feel greasy or sticky. There is very little scent using the product, and no apparent scent left in the hair, which is definitely a plus for me. I wash my hair every other day and use the conditioner each time, and it has had a definite positive effect (vs no conditioner). At this price, it is definitely a great value.",
