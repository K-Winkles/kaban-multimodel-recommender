With that being said I don't recommend long-term use with people struggling with oily hair. For dandruff it worked wonders I was shocked. I tried original Head and shoulders and other products. It got to the point where I was doing home remedies since I had dandruff for a couple of months. I gave this a shot and within two uses no itch and notice less flakes within 2 weeks completely gone no flakes at all",
