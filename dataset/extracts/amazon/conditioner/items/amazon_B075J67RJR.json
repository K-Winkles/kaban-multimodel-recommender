I do now!From loving the oil I decided to dig a little deeper and saw they have a ghost conditioner as well! Imagine my surprise.I used it for the first time today and my hair feels flowy and I have the feeling of being an ethereal little fairy with flowing hair that's not greasy not frizzy not heavy it's just there. Normally at the end of a long 12 hour day I usually wanted to shave my hair off from it being flat greasy and frizzyBut after my long 12 hour day today (pictured above) it's like I just blow dried it after a shower. I'm so happy.I feel volume stayed in my hair throughout the day as wellI could write an essay about how happy I am but I'll leave it at that",

What I like most about this product is that it feels like a shampoo when you're applying it (slight foam), but is very easy to work through to the ends of your hair. I use about 1/2 as much as I would using other conditioners, and the scent is very pleasant. Highly recommend it.",
