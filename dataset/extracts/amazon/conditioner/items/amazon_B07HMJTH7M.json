                "reviewText": "I love the Aveeno brand shampoos. I started off using the Rosemary and Chamomile scent, which smells amazing. This one is ok, not as nice, but definitely smells like blackberries -- so it has a fruity smell with a hint of grains. It does a great job of protecting my copper color that I have my hair dyed -- honestly have been told by my stylist that my color is holding up very well, considering reds tend to fade faster than most. One of the things that I like about this shampoo, is that it is one of the few brands that help with an itchy scalp. I have oily hair but I sweat a lot on my scalp too for some reason, so my scalp gets super itchy. No flakes or anything, just makes me want to scratch my skin like crazy because of dried sweat. This shampoo helps so much with that, neutralizing any itchiness. Some shampoos actually make me itch worse, and this doesn't. It's better than shampoos with teatree oil imho -- which I've also tried. It's also not terribly expensive like some of the salon brands and doesn't have a lot of harsh chemicals, in fact it is sulfate and paraben free, which I also love. My hair feels healthy and shiny and uncoated.",

                "reviewText": "I have color treated, straight, and thick hair. Ever since I dyed my hair it\u2019s been a nightmare to untangle every time I shower. Before Aveeno I used the pantene color conditioner and it was fine but it was so hard to wash out. Aveeno didn't have this problem. It was easy to rinse out, hydrating to my hair, and made detangling it easier. It also smells so good. I wash and condition my hair everyday so I ran out of this product around 3 weeks in. With its affordable price, I don't mind repurchasing every couple of weeks.",

                "reviewText": "It smells great, feels thick enough like it should do the trick, and your hair does feel clean after, but after washing and conditioning, my hair did not feel like it was conditioned at all. My hair was super frizzy, worse than with any other product. I actually wound up having bad split ends within a week after using this line of products. Got my hair cut and switched back to my old stuff I was using for years.",
