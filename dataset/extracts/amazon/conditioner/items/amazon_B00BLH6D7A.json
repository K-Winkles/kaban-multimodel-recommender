                "reviewText": "I will say 2 nice things about this product first. It's organic... yay. It smells fantastic... a real lavender scent. Besides these things, I found this conditioner to be absolutely useless and ineffective! I used to buy Avalon Organics shampoo and conditioner regularly some years ago and was VERY satisfied with them. The only reason I stopped using them is because our budget got really tight and I had to buy cheaper products. As I have been able to buy nicer products again, I wanted to give Avalon another try. Feeling I could trust that it was a good product, I made the mistake of buying a really big bottle of it on Amazon, excited to see the good value. First... I was not able to get the pump nozzle to release by turning it, no matter what I tried. So, I just used it by pouring it out the top. I was extremely surprised and disappointed to find that it was a completely different consistency than I remember (but same great smell). When I used it years ago it was nice and thick and I didn't have to use a huge volume of it to get good coverage for my hair. This stuff was so thin, I had to use handfuls of it just to feel it on my hair at all, and even with a huge volume applied, I felt like there was nothing in my hair. Even what was in my hair just ran and dripped off instead of being retained and letting my hair soak in it a little while. After I rinsed and got out of the shower, I was disgusted to find that, as I tried to brush my hair, not only was my hair dry and tangly, as if it has not been conditioned at all, but I began to notice a waxy build up on my hair brush, which I have never yet experienced! I would return it if my return window was not already closed. Now it will probably just go in the trash... a complete WASTE of money and resources!",

                "reviewText": "I love this conditioner. It's a little on the liquidy side, not thick like conventional conditioners; however, it works fine. It's moisturizing and contains clean ingredients.However, do be aware of the packaging. Sometimes they ship it strapped to a cardboard piece in a box that it fits in perfectly. Other times they just throw it in a bag inside a box that it doesn't fit well in (in which case the cap breaks open and all the contents squeeze out).",

I also use the matching shampoo when I do need a good scrub. After trying all the curl method options, I can use this as often as I like and it doesn\u2019t destroy/dry out my curls or weigh them down between washes. I get tons of compliments since I\u2019ve been using it and I\u2019ve noticed my curls are shinier and bouncier/lighter weight than with other thicker (shea butter) conditioners. Very nice to see from a natural option.",

                "reviewText": "In the quest for healthy, nourished hair, I recently tried the Avalon Organics Conditioner. Promising organic ingredients and a natural approach, I was hopeful for a transformative experience. However, what followed was an unexpected journey that left me with dried-out hair and a flare-up of my rosacea. Avalon Organics Conditioner boasts an impressive list of natural and organic ingredients on its label. These include essential oils that claim to provide deep hydration and revitalization for your hair. However, as they say, \u201cthe proof is in the pudding.\u201d One of the most puzzling aspects of my experience was the conditioner\u2019s effect on my hair. Instead of the expected silkiness and smoothness, it seemed to suck the moisture right out of my locks. This left my hair feeling dry and brittle, a far cry from the promised hydration. The real plot twist came when I noticed a significant worsening of my rosacea symptoms. It\u2019s crucial to mention that I\u2019ve had my rosacea under control for quite some time. However, the inclusion of essential oils in this conditioner seemed to trigger an unexpected rosacea flare-up, leaving my skin red, inflamed, and irritated. Intrigued by this unusual reaction, I decided to delve deeper into the product\u2019s ingredients. It turns out that some essential oils, when applied topically, can exacerbate skin conditions like rosacea in certain individuals. This revelation added an unexpected layer to my experience. My journey with Avalon Organics Conditioner was indeed an eye-opener. While it may work wonders for some, it proved to be a gamble for my hair and skin. The drying effect on my hair and the unexpected rosacea flare-up left me baffled. It serves as a reminder that what\u2019s labeled as \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d may not always be suitable for everyone. Before trying any new product, it\u2019s essential to understand your own unique skin and hair needs. This conditioner may hold promise for some, but for me, it was an unexpected twist in my beauty routine.",
