                "reviewText": "I didn\u2019t want to buy this, because the last time I used it was probably 1995 & I\u2019ve since moved on to wayyyy fancier products which aren\u2019t hideously packaged. But, I have always been on the hunt for a great conditioner for my coarse, curly, wild, long hair. I have tried so many, even many products made for ethnic hair (even though my ancestors came from Scandinavia & no further south than Germany on any side) and nothing has given me the softness & gloss I\u2019ve been looking for.Well, I saw this Amazon deal & remembered this product from my youth, so for the price I said screw it, let\u2019s do it.First, the negative: bottle looks like something that belongs in your teen\u2019s bathroom, not yours. I\u2019m a ho for good aesthetics, so I really dislike that. It\u2019s really thick, so not easy to decant into a bottle, but I\u2019ll come up with something. Its garish purple is ruining the vibe of my shower lol. Next, the smell. It\u2019s not awful per se, but I lean very heavily toward orientals, incense, sandalwood- think Aveda or Pureology. So these cheap drug store vaguely fruity floral girly scents are NOT my jam. I have to pat some dark patchouli oil in my hair after using this so I don\u2019t smell like a person who wears fuchsia nail polish.BUT\u2026 the good. There is a reason this product has been a best selling cult product for literally decades. It freaking works. My hair went from being mad about being too dry all the time to laying in glossy but not weighed down curls. It feels soft. It looks super healthy even though I desperately need a split ends trim. (Since my hair is so long, I rub a little extra in the ends as a leave in treatment without needing an extra product).Bottom line- value for $ cannot be beat & if you can tolerate this very not-chic bottle & fragrance, your curly girl hair will thank you.",

                "reviewText": "Three of them for this price is phenomenal. This product has been around for a long, long time and the quality is still there. Great for moisturizing dry hair and a great leave in conditioner for dry ends. You get a lot of it for what you pay for. This is no thin, runny conditioner. This is thick and works all the tangles out as you put it in your hair. The smell is fresh and tropical. My hair smells great when I use this. I'll definitely repurchase but I won't need to for some time since you get three bottles. Definitely recommend if you have normal to very dry hair. Would be great to get a spray bottle, add some product and the rest water. Shake well and use as a leave in conditioner or dry hair before brushing.",

                "reviewText": "I've been hearing folks talk about Aussie my whole teen-into-adult life, but had just stuck with cheaper V05 type options. Finally decided to take the plunge, and I am LOVING this stuff. My hair is silky smooth and I've properly noticed a difference.My hair type is thin and straight, and I've always had issues with volume - but this truly gives my hair shape that I am a fan of.Some tips (also willing to accept tips/criticism):You should leave conditioner in your hair for a bit for it to work effectively. I typically shampoo first, rinse immediately, conditioner, wash my face and body, then rinse my conditioner at the end.Also - if you're prone to oily hair like I am, you can always opt to condition just your tips OR just dilute for your scalp. I tend to do about a nickel sized dollop and run half through my ends/tips, then rub my hands together, run them for a brief moment under the water to thin, and place it on my scalp.Apologies if this is all general knowledge, it's stuff that took me into late 20s to figure out and I know it's still not perfect.TLDR: Solid product.",

                "reviewText": "I have bleached hair and I need a conditioner that is super moisturizing. I have actually been spending 30-40 $ on fancy, salon products for my hair but I am also a college student and am trying to pinch pennies, so I finally decided that it was silly of me to spend that much. I was looking for a affordable conditioner that would help my damaged hair and then, I remembered I used this conditioner when I was like 14 and it worked SO well! This 3-pack is an insanely good deal. I leave this in my hair for about 10 minutes and it honestly moisturizes just as good as the expensive products I was using. The scent isn\u2019t my favorite. It\u2019s not overwhelming, so it\u2019s tolerable but I usually go for more natural scented things like rosemary. For the price, it is worth it to me and I will continue to use this!",
