This might be a considered a lightly fragranced product but to say that it is fragrance free is a flat lie.I really wish these manufacturers would understand that their false advertising can cause actual harm to people. 0 accountability.I ordered this conditioner because I really like the serum by this company. I put the conditioner in my hand and didn't smell anything. I put the conditioner on my hair and woah-- perfume like scent!! Gave me a headache, lungs tight plus fatigue. Next time I will try it out on my arm instead of hair as it is much easier to wash out.Unfortunately this keeps happening (I'm looking at you Lume with your supposedly Unscented Deodorant). It seems I can't trust the words \"unscented\" and \"fragrance free\" anymore which is sad. What these people are doing is making money of a medically sensative group of people without providing a product that suits them. Shameful.If you're looking for truly Unscented products try No Nothing and Honest Co.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this conditioner after getting frustrated with scalp breakouts that I suspected were being caused by my previous drugstore conditioner. I did see an improvement after switching, so I\u2019ve continued to use it even though the price hurts almost as much as the scalp acne did.As a conditioner, I would rate it \u201cokay\u201d for my thick, coarse hair. It\u2019s not the most moisturizing or smoothing conditioner I\u2019ve used, but it does well enough. You do need to leave it on for several minutes in order to get the full effect - it doesn\u2019t do much if you rinse it off right away.",
