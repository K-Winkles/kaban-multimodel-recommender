I wouldn't say it performs to the same caliber, but For the lower price it is excellent.I ran out of detangler from my child, And I won't go back to buying it because this conditioner works far better than any detangler ever did!! And it leaves their hair feeling very soft and smooth.Also I got another use out of it, which is a little funny to review. But this shampoo and conditioner work phenomenally to defrizz and smooth Barbie hair! The dolls' hair all feel light and smooth and they smell great!
