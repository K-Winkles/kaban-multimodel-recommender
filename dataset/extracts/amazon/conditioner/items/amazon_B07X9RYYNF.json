                "reviewText": "I bought this conditioner as an addition to the corresponding shampoo. I know that this is a lot of money to spend on a conditioner but I wanted to try this brand for a long time and finally took the plunge. I love it!!! It has a light perfume smell to it. No overwhelming but it stays with you all day. I think the scent even smells expensive!!! I have fine, thin, color treated short hair. My hair is flat. This conditioner seemed perfect for me. It is not heavy and you don't need to use very much. The directions said to leave it on for one minute before rinsing which I did. After blow drying, I feel it made my hair super shiny and soft. But I was still able to curl it with a curling iron and the curls held great. This is a perfect conditioner for me. Even though it's pricey I feel it's worth it. I will certainly buy this product again. With the little amount that you need the bottle should last quite a long time.",
