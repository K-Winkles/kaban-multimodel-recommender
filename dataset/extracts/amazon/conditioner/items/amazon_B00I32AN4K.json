It arrived in very good condition, with no leakage or mess and the results are impressive.My hair is prone to brittleness, especially during the Wintertime, but has been feeling so much better since I started using this hair mask. The mask has reduced breakage, making my hair stronger and more resilient. The hydration is exceptional, which has been bringing back softness to my hair. What's truly amazing is the newfound shine \u2013 my hair looks healthier and more vibrant than ever. The scent is subtle but pleasant, without being overpowering.Incorporating this mask into my routine has been extremely helpful. If you want a quick and noticeable hair transformation, this product is worth the investment.It says on the product to use it around 2 times per week, but I only use it once a week, and look at the shine! The pictures of my hair that I took are after using the product 3 times. I hope it helps you like it helped me :)",

                "reviewText": "I recommend trying this mask, and I\u2019m delighted to explain why!First, it smells nice. The description I\u2019m about to give may seem off-putting, but trust me when I say that is all me and my skill in description, not the product. The scent is, for lack of a better description, \u201csophisticated bubblegum.\u201d There is a top note that is sweet and smells a bit like lotus, hence the bubblegum, but then there\u2019s warmth to it, with something slightly woody and herbal, and a gentle but not powdery musk base. It smells good, like sniff-your-hair good, but it\u2019s not overpowering.Then, the slip! Yes, there are -cones in this product, hence only using it once or twice a week. I know as a curly person I\u2019m supposed to rear back in horror, bare my teeth, and hiss if a product that has -cones comes near me, but y\u2019all, I\u2019m color-treated and porous. I want some sealage! Furthermore, I\u2019m thinking that if you\u2019re trying to comb out a situation\u2014and I\u2019m talking matting, I\u2019m talking gum, I\u2019m talking creepy-crawlies, I\u2019m betting the slip in this would stand up and take a bow after just sliding all your troubles away.Finally, the results. As y\u2019all know, sometimes you need protein, sometimes you need moisture, and sometimes you need to stay away from both\u2014protein making you brittle, or humectants like glycerin that\u2019ll either suck the moisture back out of your hair shaft or suck so much in from humid air that you\u2019re either electrifying the world with static or turning into a swamp poodle. Yes, I have been to those places and it is lonely and frizzy. This, however, is not a protein mask or a moisturizing mask, it\u2019s a sealing mask. Yes, you can use protein or moisture before you use this, but this is just going to lock that underneath it and to your hair. If you\u2019re looking for a good mask to layer on your ends, for example, here you go!Buy and enjoy!",

After the first use I combined it with some other oils and presses and really couldn't tell what it did for my hair. This time I used it after shampooing with Pantene. I left it on a couple of minutes and rinsed. I liked that it smoothed my hair cuticles. After slightly towel drying my hair felt soft and there was no frizz. The pictures show one side after blow drying on high heat. I have thick hair as I stated and it takes more heat to dry it prior to styling. I was pleased with the results! It only took 6 minutes to dry both sides. My blow dryer has the comb attachment which helped dry the roots. I didn't give 5 stars because the jar was 3/4 full and it was hard to remove the plastic covering after taking off the lid. Overall a good conditioner. I would buy it again and recommend it to family and friends.",
