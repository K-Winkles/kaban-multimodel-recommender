                "reviewText": "I have short fine hair with some highlights. The conditioner will go a long way as only a dime size or less leaves my hair soft and shiny. However, sometimes I think it wears my hair down a bit. I wonder if a regular conditioner of the same brand would work best for my hair. I also bought the shampoo and like it as well.",
