My hair has been much more manageable over this past year: much less severity of frizz with my gray and dyed hair. My hair texture to the touch has greatly improved, and no longer feels or looks dry. Is actually shiny/silky now. My hair is shoulder length. Been using these 2 products for over a year, and has helped make the big difference. I highly recommend this product line. I also checked into: best use of styling tools for least damage, use a Satin pillowcase now, use a microfiber cloth correctly before using a dryer now correctly also, \u2026 all of this and these 2 products have really helped my hair\u2019s appearance go from drab, dry, frizzy \u2026 to now: healthy, shiny, silky, with movement and a youthful appearance. I\u2019m sticking with what is working for me now\u2026 such a dramatic difference from last year+!!",

Every time I open it I'm afraid I'm going to end up skinning my knuckles and/or damaging my nail (which is the only way to get it to open). I'm not planning on buying it again for this reason. There's too many good products in the market to use one with this sort of a dumb issue.If it had a pump instead of the cap, I probably would get it again.Oh, I suppose I should mention too that I had to exchange the first bottle I got because it was a milk-like texture and it smelled like something that has gone bad. I had no issue with the return or anything, and the bottle I received from the exchange was perfectly fine, but I'm curious if anyone else has had that issue!",

So I have been alternating both the shampoo and conditioner with my purple shampoo/conditioner for my blonde hair. I can definitely see and feel a difference in the decreased frizz, increased shine and overall health of my hair in just a few weeks. My daughter is thrilled that I am a convert too, I had been resistant to spending the money. I did get the conditioner on sale before Christmas, but the shampoo was full price.",
