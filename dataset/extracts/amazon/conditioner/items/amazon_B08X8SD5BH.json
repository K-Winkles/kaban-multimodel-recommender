                "reviewText": "I like the scent of this conditioner but overall, for me, I saw no improvement in my hair. I actually had better results from the 'Bed Head Dumb Blonde' conditioner. I'll be going back to that one.I saw a lot of people in reviews complain about it being too hard to get the product out- I had zero issues. My guess, is they either had an expired bottle, or they were trying to shake the product down to the top while the top was open. You have to keep the top closed to get it to flow down when it's a thicker product like a conditioner, or moisturizer, or a body lotion, etc. (If you try to shake it down while the lid is open, it's going to suck air back inside of the bottle, which pushes the product back inside of the bottle. Keep the lid closed so there's no resistance!)Everyone's hair reacts differently to products so, I do recommend giving this one a chance. Just because it didn't help me doesn't mean it won't help someone else.",
