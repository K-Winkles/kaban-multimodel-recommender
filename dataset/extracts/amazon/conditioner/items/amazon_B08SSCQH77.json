I have long, thick hair and struggle to find a conditioner that is safe for color treated hair that really feels like it makes a difference. This is it!! I have spent so much money trying everything and almost gave up. This doesn't wash out my deep red/purple color on my naturally dark hair and leaves it soft and manageable without adding 5 more products after I wash my hair. I was ready to cut my hair until I came across this line!! Don't hesitate, buy it.",
