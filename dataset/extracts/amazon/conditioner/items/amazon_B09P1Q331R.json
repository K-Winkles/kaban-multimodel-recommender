                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this conditioner for ~3 months now, and it is truly the best conditioner I\u2019ve ever used for my hair. I have thick, wavy, normally frizzy hair that tends to get dried out with other shampoos. This conditioner keeps the frizz under control and makes my hair feel amazingly soft and smooth. It does make it feel a bit weighed down, which is great for me, but may not be good for someone with finer or thinner hair. When I first got it, the scent was so lovely. However, after a few months the scent has faded considerably and has kind of an unpleasant undertone to it when I blow dry my hair. That\u2019s my one complaint, but it\u2019s so good in every other way that I\u2019ll continue using it and buy more when I run out.",

Half of my hair literally falls after a Brazilian blowout process, my hair was dull and very sensitized and this saved my hair, now it\u2019s soft, shiny and thick, all thanks to this product.3. The smell it\u2019s ok, I have a very sensitive nose and although I\u2019m not fan of it, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all4. I have tried everything Orbe, Kerastase, Briogeo, OUAI\u2026 nothing comes close to this product, it\u2019s amazing",

                "reviewText": "\u201cI was really excited to try this brand but I have to say I was underwhelmed. Not a huge fan of the scent, products come half full and for the price I can\u2019t justify purchasing the full sizes that might come halfway filled. My hair felt dry after using and this did not help my frizz. I had been using the pureology smoothing shampoo and conditioner and noticed a huge difference in my hair so I\u2019ll probably stick to this. Again, I really wanted to love these products and the brand but so far I\u2019m just not impressed. Maybe it takes a few washes, so I will finish the products off and update the review if I see a noticeable difference.\u201dUpdate: I used the product again today and I have to stand 100% corrected. I have absolutely no frizz at all and the scent smells much lighter and better actually on the hair than in the tub. My main complaint with this product is how they\u2019re not filling the tub up completely. For such a tiny jar at $16.00/jar I expect it to be full. This also doesn\u2019t seem like a fluke as almost all reviews and images of the product show that it is half full. I think I will purchase the full size and refill the smaller one for travel instead of purchasing separate travel size ones because my mind has been changed on this product and I love that the conditioner is more solid in consistency which is perfect for travel!",

Yes, this size is small, and it looks as if it's enough for three uses but a small amount goes a long way as with all their products.I agree, the container could be smaller and more full looking so that the customer doesn't feel slighted, but you are definitely getting the correct amount.If you like davines products and plan on using one product specifically I'd suggest to get the larger size. If you like using different formulas get a few of these sizes. The ingredients aren't like your average drug store shampoo where you need to use more. Worth the price!",
