I've tried many different brands of deep conditioners, but, the GKhair product shas made a substantial difference. After blow drying and straightening my hair with a flat iron, it is very shiny, soft and flows freely. I just love this conditioner! I have since purchased the moisturizing shampoo & conditioner/Hair Creme/Hair Serum, plus, GKhair has sent me several free products with my orders! This is absolutely awesome! One of my favorites is the leave-in hair cream. I for sure have found my new hair care products and will continue to purchase as needed. A big thank you to a sweet nail technician in Florida who recommended GK Hair to me. She had such beautiful, shiny ethnic hair (like me) and when I asked her which products she used, she told me only GKhair. Very happy with the products!!",
