                "reviewText": "Personally, this leaves a bit of a residue in my hair despite much rinsing. It does moisturize as it claims to, but a bit at the sacrifice of feeling clean. I am not a huge fan of the pump, it is a little cumbersome to use (feel like it fights me a bit). Additionally, after several pumps it sucks in the the sides of the container, creating a need to unscrew the pump for it to reinflate itself (so as not to cause some horrific conditioner implosion mid-shower). Otherwise the scent is nice, the price was very right (at the time it was like $8 for 28 lf oz). Very upset with shrinkflation prices so the more i can get for less, the better. Just wish this conditioner jibed with my hair better. I'll still use the whole container down to the last drop... maybe my hair will be that much less damaged and better for it, who knows? Just gonna have to put up with some light residue for a while.",
