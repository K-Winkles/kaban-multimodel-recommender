I would use products with so many oils and butters in them and they left my hair as dry as the desert. This along with Pantene's shampoo of the same line (moisture) has kept my hair from having excessive breakage so I have now bought them in bulk! I hope Pantene doesn't change this product because it's a shame how companies will experiment with different ingredients and the next thing you know the products that worked for you are discontinued and you go back to having the same hair problems as before because their new products become trash.",
