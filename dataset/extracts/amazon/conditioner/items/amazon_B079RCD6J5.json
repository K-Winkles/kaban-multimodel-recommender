        "description": "Get the New York City salon experience at home with Nexxus Keraphix Conditioner for Damaged Hair, the first step to a powerful protein-infused keratin treatment that visibly heals signs of severe hair damage after just one use. Clinically proven to deliver internal repair to severely damaged hair from the very first use, Nexxus hair conditioner helps heal rough and brittle hair. The concentrated formula of this hair treatment for damaged hair features our highest level of proteins containing Keratin, Collagen, and Elastin. At Nexxus, we believe helping hair return to its optimal state means treating it with protein at high levels. Bleaching, chemical process, and rigorous heat styling is very harsh on hair and can severely damage it both inside and out. Using advanced protein science research and testing, Nexxus scientists identified Glutamic acid as the key amino acid hair protein loses when it is severely damaged. With this discovery, Keraphix's transformative PROTEINFUSION blend includes black rice (a rich source in Glutamic Acid) and strengthening keratin protein to create a healing ritual that delivers clinically-proven healthier looking hair in one use. The Nexxus Keraphix Healing System for Severely Damaged Hair heals visible signs of severe hair damage. Along with our Nexxus keratin deep conditioner, try our shampoo for damaged hair, and add a gel treatment or revitalizing hair mask. We\u2019ve created possibly our best hair mask: Keraphix Hair Masque for Damaged Hair\u2014our favorite deep conditioning hair treatment. A leader in salon-quality hair products, Nexxus uses learnings from science and nature. We know that hair is made of almost 90% proteins, which is why we use advanced scientific methods to identify the protein needs of each hair type and create customized formulas with proteins to bring your hair back to life.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the shampoo on Amazon and was so impressed with it, that I decided to try out the conditioner. Wow! My hair is so soft and \"fluffy.\" It now has bounce and lift and is incredibly soft. I live in Florida and the summer humidity makes my hair do crazy stuff, but with this shampoo and conditioner I am able to tame it. I knocked off a point for the scent because for me, I'm not 100% crazy about it. It's nice, but not as nice as the shampoo. I wish they were both the same scent. I will be purchasing more in the future.",
