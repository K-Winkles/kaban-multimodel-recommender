Every day exposures to common elements like water and chlorine have higher, more alkaline pH levels that cause damage to hair. Acidic products have a lower pH to help re-balance your pH levels. How is Acidic Bonding Concentrate different than other bonding products? Acidic Bonding Concentrate products are made with Citric Acid, which helps strengthen damaged hair. Most bonding products are treatments or in salon services which are more time consuming and an additional step in your regimen. How much of this product should I use? The Acidic Bonding Concentrate System is concentrated, which means you do not need as much as your normal haircare routine. We recommend starting with a dime size amount and increasing from there based on your hair thickness, length and preference. Is the Acidic Bonding Concentrate system suitable for color-treated hair? Yes, the Acidic Bonding Concentrate Intensive Treatment is suitable for color-treated hair. Do you have to use the intensive treatment with Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo and Conditioner? Yes, it's recommended to use the Intensive Treatment with Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo and conditioner as a system. However, the treatment delivers benefits of its own and can be used with another Redken haircare range.",

Will I ever buy another hair care routine? Also no.It\u2019s. Phenomenal. I haven\u2019t trimmed my hair in over a year and it looks and feels SO healthy!I did use the whole routine of the Redken Bonding Concentrate, shampoo, and conditioner full disclosure but again won\u2019t be buying anything else ever again. Seriously Olaplex is a joke compared to what this does for your hair!",

                "reviewText": "My stylist turned me on to this shampoo and conditioner line by accident. I was able to purchase my first bottle of each (and the leave-in cream) at half the cost through another channel. My fine (highlighted) hair that's prone to breakage absolutely seems to love this product line. The full retail cost is incredibly prohibitive, even though the shampoo lasts me 2-3 times as long as a bottle of the conditioner (and one bottle of the conditioner lasts me about a month). Unfortunately, my hair soaks the conditioner in, so it's not like it's lasting me long enough to justify the full retail cost. Having said that, I do feel like the cost is fair if you're able to purchase it at a discounted rate. I'd definitely do some research to investigate other channels to purchase at a more economical price.I'm very picky about scents, and really had to work hard to not hate the smell of the Redken Extreme line (which is what I'd used prior to this). The Acidic Bonding line has a very gender neutral scent: it's on the lighter side, though it definitely is scented, but it fades quickly, so you don't walk around smelling like your shampoo and conditioner all day. That's a plus for me, but I don't LOVE the scent. I'd call it tolerable.Does this line do what it promises? It does, though it can get heavy on fine hair. I've tested it to see if I can skip a few days and use other product lines in between, just to save on cost. I'm pretty certain that once you've washed with something else, that's it - and the \"glue\" that's bonding your split ends and frayed strands is gone until you've used this for another week straight to replace it all again. A little does go a long way, but be warned if you have porous hair that loves conditioner: you'll still use less than you're used to using with other product lines, but you'll definitely go through this quicker than the shampoo. On the flip side, while I'm on my first bottle of shampoo, and third or fourth bottle of conditioner, I'm not even halfway through my first tube of the leave-in product. That makes it the most economical purchase in the line, IMO, and the one thing that I can totally justify purchasing at full retail since it's likely to last me 3-4 months.Overall, I really do like this product line, and I would be a faithful, dedicated, every-day-no-matter-what user if only the price were more reasonable. At $30 a bottle for a shampoo and conditioner, this is a luxury purchase purchase for me regardless of how much I like it, so I'm sort of forced to try to extend my time between purchases and intersperse it with other product lines - unless I can purchase in bulk at a more reasonable price.",
