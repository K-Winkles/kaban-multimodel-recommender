Well the only conditioner I use.. I have a shelf of several bottles of conditioners that I've tried a few times and quit using because I didn't get the results i was looking forward to, My teenage daughter picked out this conditioner for herself and she loves it. The bottle was just sitting there in the shower begging me to try it out one day so I did. OGX Renewing Argan Oil is amazing. My hair is fine and very thick. So although I have a lot of hair the fineness of it makes it prone to frizzing and split ends. This stuffs amazing. It leaves my hair very shiny and it doesn't frizz at all. My natural wavy hair calms down and it's easy to style. I use about a tablespoon of conditioner each time, My hair is 2 inches below my shoulder and one tablespoon seams to be enough. I always wait 3 minutes to rinse it.",
