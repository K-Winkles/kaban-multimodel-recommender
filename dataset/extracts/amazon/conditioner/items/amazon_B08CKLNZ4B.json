I have better curl definition when wearing my hair curly and better shine when it\u2019s straight. The conditioner has a soft sweet orange scent, conditions amazingly, and these refill packs are totally my style since I recycle everything I can. Their website has a hair mask and more items I\u2019m excited to try, and if I can get more travel testers I\u2019m giving them to my friends!
