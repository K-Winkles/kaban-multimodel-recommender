Don\u2019t need to use very much to get lather. Make sure to leave conditioner in 1-2 minutes. Let it work. Spritzed in the styling spray and blew dry. Wow. I never had the volume and shine from any other product. Even held up for the next 2 days. Just have to save up $ because this is my last shampoo.",

That one was so lovely, left my hair feeling silky soft and so easy to brush through. I have fine hair so I thought I would try the thickening shampoo, but it did not live up to expectations. The smell was not great, it did not help to thicken my hair, and it left my hair an angry, tangled mess that felt like straw every time I used it. I would not recommend this product. Use the BB Curl 3-in-1 conditioner instead.",
