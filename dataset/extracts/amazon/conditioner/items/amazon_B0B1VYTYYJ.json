                "reviewText": "Overall I would say that this Dove Hair Conditioner has helped make my hair less dry and more soft. My hair tends to be dry and frizzy after just washing with just shampoo. This conditioner has helped my hair by making it softer and smoother (less dry and less frizzy). I usually shampoo my hair and rinse off the shampoo soap. Then I apply the Dove conditioner to my hair and spread the conditioner with a little water, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Afterwards I try to rinse off the conditioner with warm water. This is somewhat difficult to do and I notice that there is a noticeable Dove conditioner scent left on my scalp despite rigorous rinsing with water. However, my hair is softer and smoother. I guess this is the trade-off. A lightly scented hair conditioner might help with reducing the residual scent. Overall, I am satisfied with the results and I would recommend this Dove conditioner especially for its reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I have highlighted curly hair below my shoulders and this balm is now a lifesaver for me. It's so hard to find a good conditioner for hair like mine that gets tangled all the time and can't be combed after washing, yes it moisturizes the hair, but I also use a leave-in conditioner on the ends to organize my curls. It is thicker than other balms, and I use only a small amount, and the price is absolutely amazing for such excellent quality, haha. Thanks a lot!",
