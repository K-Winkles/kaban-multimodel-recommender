I always try to used paired shampoo and conditioner because I think it\u2019s the best way to see the most benefits and this conditioner is a perfect example of that. I love the smell and unlike a lot of other midline budget hair care brands, the smell was long lasting and I even was complimented on my hair smell two days after I used the conditioner. I shampoo twice and use this conditioner, leaving on for at least ten to fifteen minutes in the shower before rinsing. I usually can find on sale and I stock up while I can.",

I've bought so many hair products over the years - and dumped them because they just didn't work on my hair. This was so affordable I thought it was worth a try, and it performed as advertised. Even my hairdresser asked me what I was using (she only uses Matrix products) because she noticed the difference in my hair and has now told other clients about this product. You can buy it at Walmart but I think it costs a little less at Amazon.It may not work on my hair forever but for now, I absolutely love it and won't use anything else.",
