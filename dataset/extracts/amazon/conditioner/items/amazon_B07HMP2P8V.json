This one is it!!! I\u2019ve bought high-end products and clean products, etc, you name it and I\u2019ve tried it. This one meets everything I\u2019m looking for and smells lovely! I usually can\u2019t use highly fragranced products but the ingredients in this are clean enough that it doesn\u2019t bother my scalp at all and leaves my hair smelling good!",

                "reviewText": "I don't like it as much as I wanted, but it's not badPROs:-my head doesn't itch like it does with almost every other dry shampoo I have tried which is kind of a big deal because it claims to be gentle and actually is!-the white residue it leaves it minimal and is very easily brushed out.CONs:-my hair feels weird. Yes it feels like the product absorbs excess oil from my scalp and my hair does feel cleaner, but it doesn't actually look cleaner or refreshed. It still looks semi-greasy because it plasters the hair to my head even after brushing and attempted fluffing. It also makes my hair feel super texturized. Imagine if you put a bunch of hairspray on your head and left it overnight and then brushed it out the next morning. The hair isn't stiff or sticky but it definitely doesn't feel presentable. This would be fine if you were going to just use the product and then wear a messy bun/ponytail or were going to go workout, but using this and wearing my hair down does not work because it makes the hair difficult to manage-the smell. This could be hit or miss, honestly. It's not specifically fruity, floral, citrus, musky, or baby powdery. It reminds me of professional products in salons if anyone can understand that. It's certainly not a bad smell and there's no hint of an off-putting chemical smell. It's just different and unexpected.",

                "reviewText": "I'm allergic to just about every hair care product there is. Shampoos, conditioners, hair gels and sprays, you name it. I used special eczema-safe shampoo and conditioner for years (sure, they're hypoallergenic, but otherwise they suck) and only recently found some that doesn't give me hives and/or severely itchy scalp (Pharmacopeia Citrus, for fellow sufferers - it's organic, vegan and not chock full of chemicals). Aveeno has been a great brand for me in the past, with excellent anti-itch eczema lotions and such... so I thought if anyone's going to make a dry shampoo that doesn't trigger my allergies, Aveeno's probably my best bet. Even so, I steeled myself for the distinct possibility that this was going to be just one more of the dozens and dozens of products I've bought, tried once, and had to give or throw away due to my allergies. But this stuff is fantastic! Does a wonderful job on my hair and makes it look great for those daily Zoom meetings at work. Smells really nice without being overpowering or allergenic to my nose and lungs. Absolutely no itching or rashes. Easy and quick - takes only a few seconds to use if I'm in a hurry. Hair has body and looks beautiful and natural. Couldn't be more pleased with this product! Thanks, Aveeno!EDIT: I'm now allergic to the Pharmacopeia Citrus as well. Such is my allergic life. So I tried the Aveeno Greens shampoo and conditioner and they were actually better for less money. My hair feels more moisturized, my wallet feels fatter... and look ma, no hives! Been using for several months now with zero problems. Shoulda tried Aveeno first, I guess. Ha.",
