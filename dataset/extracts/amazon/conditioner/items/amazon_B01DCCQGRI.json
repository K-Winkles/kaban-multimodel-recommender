                "reviewText": "I usually use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Scalp and Hair Treatment, but the \"anti-thinning\" property of this new product caught my attention. Let me start of my staying that I have a very sensitive scalp, thus I end up having to use one product for my hair and one for my scalp since most shampoos and conditioners irritate my scalp terribly. The Scalp and Hair Treatment mentioned earlier I use exclusively on my scalp since it's soothing and I find it important to still moisturize my scalp (because that's the base for new hair growth). The Anti-Thinning Conditioner is definitely a much thinner consistency and also has a more medicinal smell to it. However, it too, has not caused any irritations to my scalp. It's also a bit lighter thus, it weighs my hair down less than the Scalp Treatment. I've been using it for about a month and a half and I don't see a significant difference in hair thickness, but I think a see a reduction or hair thinning, although very small. The hair near my scalp where I apply it looks super healthy and shiny so I'm sure it's had its benefits on my hair. However, I had very similar results with the Scalp Treatment. In the end, if my scalp begins to dry out during the winter time since this is a thinner formula, I will switch back to the Scalp Treatment (Especially since I love the scent on that one!), but in the mean time, for the summer heat and sweat, this one does pretty well.",
