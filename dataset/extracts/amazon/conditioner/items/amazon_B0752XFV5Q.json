                "reviewText": "My sister-in-law gifted me the Paul Mitchell Invisiblewear shampoo and conditioner and it has done wonders for my hair. I have naturally curly hair, and have tried many different shampoos & conditioners from the regular store over the years (Pantine, Fructis, Herbal Essance, Costco brands etc..) Also many products meant for curly hair. I've always fought friz, puffyness, and managability. I don't know the science of it, but Paul Mitchell Invisiblewear just does something wonderful to my hair! It makes it less frizzy, lay nicer, more managable, the curls are piecier, and it just looks better! I'm never going back. I was bummed when our local Ulta stopped carrying it.It's very lightweight, and doesn't weigh my hair down, which makes it seem like it isn't \"working\" like other conditioners, but it does help with detangling (I should know, having curly hair I only brush my hair after I wash it) without leaving it heavy with product buildup. I don't know how it works, but for this girl with thick curly hair, I have finally found the product that works for me. In addition to Paul Mitchell Invisablewear shampoo and conditioner, I use Herbal Essences Curl booster mousse and my hair has never been better! Highly reccommend this product",

                "reviewText": "I just bought a second bottle! I have waist length fine (but lots of it) hair that I don't use products in or blow dry. I really needed a lightweight product that would help with combing and smooth it a bit, but with minimal added weight. This has worked really well for me, in combination with a lemon clarifying shampoo. Hair is very shiny, fairly soft (not as much as a product that coats and weighs down, but I understood that would be a sacrifice for the lightweight part). I tried something else in between bottles, which I disliked, so going back to this. I think reviewers it hasn't worked for need a heavier more moisturizing conditioner. Smell is wonderful, but doesn't really linger on hair too much. Like most salon quality products, I don't need very much even with my very long hair, so it lasted me quite awhile and the value is good. I recommend trying this!",
