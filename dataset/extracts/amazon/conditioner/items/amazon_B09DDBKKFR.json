I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would boost my volume and condition at the same time. Unfortunately, the product does not work for the appearance of thinning hair and I didn't see any real changes in volume. The smell is a bit off and it does not do a good job conditioning. It also takes three pumps of product to get my hair into a lather. The condition is not good. It leaves your hair feeling dry and full of tangles. Overall I would not recommend this Dove product.",
