                "reviewText": "I am super, super, super picky about conditioner for my hair- it is impossible for me to find something that works well. I have medium length, fine, curly hair and use a conditioning mask nearly every time I wash my hair because normal conditioners just aren't enough. There's always something not right: not moisturizing enough, leaves a residue, leaves my roots too oily, etc. etc.I can't believe how well this stuff worked on my hair. It seems silly but one of the first things I noticed was how the ingredient list was a fraction of the size of most others and there were no silicones that I could find (something I avoid putting on my hair unless absolutely necessary). My hair drank this up and felt so silky smooth which is almost unheard of for me without detangler or leave-in conditioner. Not only that but it didn't weigh my hair down at all and smelled great.As an added bonus, my hubby also tried it and his scalp tends to be pretty sensitive on what he can use for shampoo and conditioner and he said this didn't give him any issues at all and he really liked it.For four large bottles under $20 this is a really great deal- especially when I've been buying crazy expensive salon-level conditioners that don't perform nearly as well as this!",

                "reviewText": "What a great value! All four bottles were neatly shipped in a box together, and arrived without any damage. The conditioner is great, it leaves my hair super silky, soft, and moisturized. It really helped with some of the winter static that I was experiencing. a little bit of this conditioner went a really long way I have longer hair with extensions so it\u2019s much thicker. I did not use the normal amount of product that I usually would as it coated my hair really well. I really love the smell of this conditioner as well, it\u2019s not too overpowering, but strong enough to make my hair smell great all day.",
