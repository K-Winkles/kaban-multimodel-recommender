                "reviewText": "I mean it\u2019s shampoo and conditioner it does it\u2019s job of moisturizing my hair and does a pretty good job at it, and it does make my hair quite soft. The smell so pretty good but it\u2019s not nearly as \u201csweet\u201d or \u201coverbearing\u201d as some reviews have said. I got this because my hair is damaged and needed nourishment and I will say it did make it feel healthier but it didn\u2019t fix much damage it just kept it at bay, and I also got this because I WANTED a sweet, overbearing scent; as my hair doesn\u2019t hold scents very well and I want a shampoo and conditioner with a lot of fragrance. So I\u2019m disappointed about the scent but it\u2019s not bad. It also doesn\u2019t supply any volume at all, but that\u2019s not what I was looking for in a shampoo. It makes my hair flat but it\u2019s nothing a blow dryer and some hair spray won\u2019t fix. The bottle so really convenient for traveling and it came in perfect shape.",

I find it just too sweet smelling, and not like the natural apricot scent but rather very sugary like a dessert. It's also not as conditioning for my dry hair. Didn't help with keeping it smooth or tangle free. I found hair falling with this product. So will go back to what I was using. I wanted to give this a try on account of the price and the high rating but it's not as effective for me. I do have highlights and need something with a good protein, keratin and moisturizing balance to keep my hair soft and manageable. This didn't do the job for me. I had to use additional hair oils to keep it soft. It was especially not too useful after I touch up my base color.",
