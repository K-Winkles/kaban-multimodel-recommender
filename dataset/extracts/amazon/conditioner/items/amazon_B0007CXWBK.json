                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Conditioner For Men",
                "reviewText": "I have a full head of hair that tends to suffer from a cowlick in the back and just gets wild when I wash it daily, which I do by habit (and because I work out a lot.) I also have to wear a hat at work which makes it stick out at utterly insane angles (one friend even remarks that I look like a cardinal with all my hair pointedly protruding like tail feathers in the back), especially when it is hot and humid outside. Because of these physical follicular foibles, I have for years been looking for a conditioner that can help me control my hair without making it feel greasy or plastered down.This is the one. I can't imagine using another conditioner after using \"American Crew Daily Conditioner For Men.\" It makes my hair hold its shape in all temperature and meteorological conditions (no more humidity issues), and doesn't change the fundamental texture of my hair. The woman who cuts my hair recommended this product, and for once it was a good suggestion. Normally the pitch for something like \"Honey Mustard Dijonnaise Leave-In Conditioning Mousse\" at the end of a haircut leaves me a bit skeptical. I was skeptical this time as well, especially after reading the claim that it \"instantly detangles and create silky smooth feel\" and \"reduces oil texture.\" For once I was pleasantly surprised. This stuff is wonderful. Having had a lot of chemistry in my background, I suspect the secret of the control here is in the proportions of Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone; while the refreshing and masculine scent is obviously due to the olfactory interactions of Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis) Leaf Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Quilla Saporaria Bark Extract, Menthol, and Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil. (Don't let the hint of menthol frighten you off; it has a clean scent, not an antiseptic one.)The price seems a bit high on this product, but understand that the product is very concentrated, and requires much less per use than cheaper conditioners. I have a full head of hair and I require only a dime-sized dollop of conditioner to do the job. My last 15.2 ounce bottle lasted about five months.In summary, even if you are skeptical of conditioners and have searched for years, this is the product I recommend above all others for bringing your hair into submission.",

I started using American Crew products many years ago, when a hair stylist I started to go to used them. The products seem nice, so I have been using various ones over the years. I am no expert on hair conditioners, but this seems to be a good one. I don't have any complaints with it. A tiny amount goes a long way, and it smells nice. You can notice there is mint in it, because it has that slightly cold feeling that mint gives you. I would have to try this back-to-back with other quality conditioners to see how this stacks up. I have used quality conditioners from other brands over the years. I just don't recall how they compare to each other. I would say this at least 4 out 5 stars.",

I bought this because I noticed that my scalp was a bit drier than normal so I had dandruff, and since I normally don't have dandruff I didn't want to invest in a dandruff shampoo, so I bought this. This has solved all my problems as a conditioner as I have little to no dandruff now and my scalp feels less dry.One thing that I loved (but you may not) about this conditioner is that it has a cooling sensation when applied to your wet hair. This is a similar situation when you chew mint gum, but a more subdued version of that for your head. It's not a chill burn by any means (it's actually more therapeutic), but it is noticeable.",

I have been using it for a while and havent seen an improvement however it might be working slowly on my emerging solar panel on top of my head. I didnt buy it for the hair growth, I purchased it for scent and how it makes my hair feel.",

El aroma es a menta y con un peque\u00f1o toque de romero, pero no es especialmente fuerte (a excepci\u00f3n de la menta). Como es mentolado, deja una sensaci\u00f3n refrescante en el cuero cabelludo al emplearlo.",
