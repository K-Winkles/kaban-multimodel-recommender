I don't recommend the shampoo, but the conditioner works great. Sleek, smooth, and shiny hair with little to no frizz. If I blow dry my hair I have zero frizz which is the first time in my life I've gotten the frizz under control. Leaves my hair shiny and smells great. I use in combination with Brad Mondo's Viper smoothing oil and my hair looks like it could be in modeling commercials. I've gotten compliments from coworkers, family, strangers, and hair stylists even. Finally love my hair. Really recommend for someone looking to tame the frizz.P.s. I only put it on my mids and ends of hair and leave in for at least 5 min; 10 min if I have the time. Never on the scalp. And I only wash my hair 3 times a week (it takes about 4 hours to dry if I don't blow dry it).Background: I have waist length half color treated hair, half natural hair that is super thick and slightly wavy. I'm German, English, French, Irish, and Korean.",
