After wetting hair with water, I massage scalp, drench head and hair with apple cider vinegar mixture, massage head again, rinse, and detangle, which is an easy process. Then, saturate hair shafts and ends, with conditioner, massaging scalp, and running hands through hair, which is an easy task. Rinse, t-shirt dry, and apply a leave in conditioner. That is my consistent weekly hair routine, simple, inexpensive and to the point. As long as my hair continues to strive and flourish, this is the only rinse out hair conditioner, for my hair. No MORE breakage. No more hair flying around on the floor or dropping in the sink, NO MORE! No additional products causing havoc. Strength is evident, and length is increasing, even the left side, which has been unresponsive for some time.",
