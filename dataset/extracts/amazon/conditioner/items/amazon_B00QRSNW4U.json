                "reviewText": "Finally a product that softens my bushy grey hair. Scent is nice too. My only concern is the shape of bottle. My old arthritic hands have some trouble grasping and squeezing the rotund shape. Product is thick so squeezing it out takes some effort. Hope geriatric friendly packaging will be considered in the future.",

It\u2019s a very heavy, thick conditioner, almost like pudding in consistency, so you can really control where you want to put it. I put a large blob of it in my hands and starting about mid-ear work it in going down to the ends. My hair is waist length and as long as I do it like this and don\u2019t put a lot on the roots, my hair stays clean and shiny for several days. It also makes my hair soft to the touch, but not too soft to style. A lot of conditioners I\u2019ve tried in the past just leave my hair limp like spaghetti, but not this one. My hair looks and feels so much better since I\u2019ve started using this along with the corresponding shampoo. I\u2019m really pleased with the results.",
