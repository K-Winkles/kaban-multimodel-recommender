But thankfully my hair bounced back about a year later, albeit in a very strange way. My hair was originally thin, wispy, and ram rod straight. It grew back in CRAZY curly. I mean, little ringlets all over mixed in with the remaining ramrod straight hair, like I had curled half of it with super small curling rods. I mean, I love the extra body but what do you do with a mess like that? It was untamable. Enter this blue goo from heaven. Yeah, it smells like my gramma, but I love my gramma so I love the smell. I just rub a quarter sized dollop into my ends after washing and comb it through with a wide tooth comb. Then I just let it dry naturally, and blammo, a couple hours of later I have sleek, glossy even curls that look like I actually used hot rollers. Really, really fantastic curl manager for someone who is new to super curly hair. I just can't stop looking at it. Never thought I would have such beautiful hair. I LOVE this stuff.",

My hair stylist recommended it to me. Hers was colorless and had a pleasant smell. This looked the same as hers but it's blue and has a slightly unpleasant odor. The odor seems to go away quickly, so I'm still using it. The bottle is enormous and will probably last me for a year or more.",
