I decided to use glass bottles at home because they are so much easier to clean, and I don't have to worry about microplastics leaching into the milk or whatnot. The only problem is that I worry about glass breaking. The Avent glass bottles are pretty sturdy, but still, I wanted a little more peace of mind. These silicone covers are perfect! They fit the Avent bottles really well. They are a great balance between having a snug fit and being easy to put on and take off. I like that there are holes where you can still see the measurement lines.",
