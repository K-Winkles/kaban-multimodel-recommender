                "reviewText": "I purchased the Pura Kiki after reading the recommendation from BabyGearLab.com in 2016. I was searching for a good \"sippy cup\" since all the mainstream ones at the store were disappointing. I realized these cups (Munchkins, The First Years, etc) were extremely difficult to drink from and leaked. I was hesitant to give Pura a try because of the cost but I'm glad I did.First off, I love that these are PURE. There is absolutely no plastic! Plastic is something we eliminated in our kitchen years ago but it crept up again since having children. With Pura I don't have to worry about plastic leaching into my child's drink.They are durable and look almost as good as the day we bought them. They recommend to replace the silicone spouts overtime, but we haven't done so because they're still fine. I have sterilized them a few times in boiling water for 5 minutes. In one of our houses, we had tile floors in the dining room and my daughter would knock the cup off which resulted in a few dings on the bottom. This is one of the downsides to this material. At times we were worried the tile would crack, but it never did. It is leak proof BUT if there's liquid in the spout at the tip where they suck and it drops or they flick it then a few drops will come out. Other than that, you can shake the cup and tip it upside down and nothing comes out.It's expensive but it grows with the child, is safe material, and lasts.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1. Stainless steel - Website says its free of toxic chemicals and certainly BPA, BPS free2. Easy to clean3. Durability - I think its good enoughCons:1. The nipples are either soft and slow Or the fast flow ones are very hard. So my baby got tired of sucking. I am using Dr. Browns nipples which fit perfectly.2. Its not leakproof.. I have to make sure the bottle does not tilt and the lid is secured the right way.3. I haven't tested this for longer time like a day but if I store milk in this bottle for 4-5 hours it smells different. I have read we can sterilize the bottle in a solution with water and vinegar .. will try that to see if that changes anythingOverall , I like that I can send this bottle to the daycare (since they wont accept Glass) instead of plastic ones.",
