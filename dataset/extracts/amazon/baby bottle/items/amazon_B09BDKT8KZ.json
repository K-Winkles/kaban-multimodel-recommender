But the good news, if your child doesn\u2019t like these, you can still use it as a bottle if you add the nipple and attachments From the other brown bottles.They don\u2019t leak, which is great. We use it more for water than milk. My little one will drink water from it but not milk.Meh for the ease of cleaning. The straw comes off, and if You clean browns in the past. They take a moment to clean all the parts. If you are use to it. It\u2019s a tad simpler.Every child is different. I will use again with our second.",

                "reviewText": "My son has health issues and he aspirates when drinking. Because of this he has to be a on a special thickened diet, and he can only drink from a slow flow straw bottle. After researching all the different options, I circled back around to the Dr. Brown's Sippy Straw Bottle. (I always come back to this brand!)The best part about this bottle is that it is easy for my sons tiny hands to hold. It comes with removeable silicone handles which he can not use because he has to sit at a 90 degree angle to drink. But even without the handles, it is still the perfect size for him to hold on his own. The handles are soft and flexible and easy to remove and clean. I also love that it has a closable lid, as I often have to pre-mix his drinks and then store them in the fridge. This allows me to not have to store open drinks overnight.These cups are not hard to clean if you have a dishwasher. I simply rinse the cup and then take all the pieces apart - the bottle, the straw, the sippy spout, and the lid - and place them in the dishwasher. I have never had an issue with mold by cleaning them this way. I do think hand washing them would be a little bit more involved, especially for the straw - but the bottles do come with a long tiny brush that fits in the straw for proper cleaning.The weighted straw does not do its job as far as being able to drink from any angle. This is not a problem for us, and actually works better in my favor due to my sons health issues and requirements - but if you are looking for a straw cup that they can tip back and still be able to drink from, this is not the one.Overall this is a great cup. Any Dr. Browns users will know that they are not ideal when it comes to being easy to clean. But it's a small price to pay for a genuinely good quality sippy cup.",

Only \u201cissue\u201d to speak on is you just have to make sure you assemble all the parts of the straw and too well together or it won\u2019t work. Just a very minor learning curve for us, but now that we know what we\u2019re doing, absolutely no issues using these bottles. They even come with a brush for the straw to clean more in depth when need be. Also love that the cover slides over the straw to keep it clean when we go out and about!",
