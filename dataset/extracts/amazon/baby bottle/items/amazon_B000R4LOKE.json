Looking back I see it says assorted colors in fine print. I wouldn\u2019t have ordered had I known. I feel it\u2019s not made clear that it\u2019s not the color shown. I should have read the fine print so that\u2019s my fault. I just expected to get what I clicked on. Typically when it\u2019s assorted colors, there\u2019s a picture of each of the colors. I had no idea it even came in blue so that felt a little misleading. I\u2019ll be sure to check the fine print next time, or just order from a seller that posts pictures of all the possible variations of the product!",
