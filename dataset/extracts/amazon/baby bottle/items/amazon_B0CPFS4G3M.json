For the most part their cups have served us well and the quality is top notch which is why when I saw these I didn\u2019t hesitate. My son recently turned 2 and he\u2019s now drinking more water so I was happy to find these cups larger cups. As you can see in my photos we have cups with this exact same design, the only difference being that these new ones are much taller. Now these come with an attachment on the inside of the lid that serves as the leak proof feature. When in these cups will not leak if the cups simply turned over, however if you were to shake it upside down some water will splatter out. For my needs this is spill proof because my son doesn\u2019t shake it and we just need protection from being left on its side. That piece on the inside lid does make the spout a little hard to get water out of but my son doesn\u2019t seem to mind. If your child gets irritated you can remove that piece just keep in mind it will leak if tipped over. These are my favorite so far when it comes to design and color, the monsters are just darling.",

Right now my son is using a thermos cup and it's been so far great. It does however leak out every chance it gets tipped over! But it has been hard to find a good cup that is easy to carry, easy to clean and leak free. These guys exceed my expectations. Firstly they are really cool looking with the holographic designs scattered around and bright colors. They have a great easy handle to carry and no matter how hard I shake it upside down it does not spill! They are super easy to clean with only two compartments that come apart and it's easy to get with a normal straw brush. My only downfall was that it took almost 2 months exactly to get delivered to me since I ordered it in December and just recieved them. Besides that they are well made and hold up to my toddlers hands!",

I washed the internal straw in the silverware container.While the advertised age range is 18+ months, we got these for our one year old twins. They have already mastered drinking out of a straw and had no issues using these at 12 months old.We did notice you have to be careful mounting the silicone ring on the lid. This silicone ring has a tab that needs to be mounted in the right orientation and also in the right position where there is an indention in the plastic rim. Otherwise the lid might leak.Overall, we are very happy with the bottles.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the size of these water bottles as they are bigger than some of other brands I've tried so they need to be filled up less often. They are also nice looking and the kids enjoyed the designs.They feel pretty sturdy but are still lightweight. One minor annoyance of them is that lifting the straw is a bit of a challenge, but I suspect it might get easier as it loosens up from regular use. More annoying, though, is the low flow rate through the straws. We've tried a handful of other brands and these were by far the hardest to drink out of. When my kids first tried it they complained that the cups didn't work. I checked it out thinking maybe I hadn't put the straw on correctly or something until I finally tried drinking through the straw, only to find it very difficult. Now they are used to it and it's not really an issue anymore, but a larger diameter straw might have been nice to avoid that.",

                "reviewText": "I like the size of these water bottles, they're a step up from our previous 12oz bottles that our toddler has been drinking from. They're well made, all hard plastic that is BPA free. I tend to like silicone better for food-grade stuff but these bottle should stand up to what toddlers put them through a little better.The variflow valves are a good idea, but can be tough for younger kids to drink from. If you're having that issue, maybe follow the other reviewer's idea of puncturing the opening to make it easier.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the #Nuby 2 Pack Iridescent PP Flip-it Kids On-The-Go Printed Water Bottles for when my grandson comes to visit. He is always looking for something to drink and takes his cup with him. When I saw these water bottles with a handle I knew he would be happy. He carries the water bottle with him when he plays and moves place to place.The bottle construction is strong and sturdy. The handle is easy to grab for an adult or child. The colors and design are bright and vibrant. The best part is the lid and straw detach. You can really get in there and clean. That feature is really helpful.The bottle is easy to wash and dry. Soapy water and a sponge do the trick. The designs do not get rubbed off when washing.The bottle is also spill-proof another great feature. My grandson often takes the water to bed and the bottle is on its side quite often.I am very happy with these water bottles and highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I love that these bottles are just about impossible to break and easy for our 2 and 4 year old to hand on to. The 2 year old has troubles swinging out the spout if it's locked in, but the 4 year old doesn't-- so I'm sure our youngest will get the hang of it soon.One thing to note is that it is initially hard to suck water through the straw. If you pop off the rubber internal bit, you'll see a + slot cut for the water side and a - cut on the air inlet side. Take a skewer or something small and shove it through both slits (the + and -) and wiggle it around to loosen them up and it makes a noticeable, immediate difference for how easy it is to drink the water. This will probably happen on it's own after a while anyways if you'd rather not.",
