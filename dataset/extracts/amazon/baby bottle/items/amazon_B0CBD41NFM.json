Dr. Talbot's bottles are made from BPA-free materials for parents' peace of mind.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bottle because I am sick of the dr browns ones leaking.First off these are harder to clean than the doctor browns, there are more pieces and the \u201cself sterilization\u201d is a pain in the rear end.Second; these leak just as much as the browns bottles. They do not leak from the nipple hole which is a plus however around the nipple seal is where they leak.Third; I do not believe these are true anti colic. The vent system makes no sense to me and I saw just as much bubbles.Overall super disappointed as I was super excited about this. Back to bottle hunting!",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I really love these bottles, but the greatest warning I can provide is just to realize how much cleaning can be involved. With these bottles and honestly any of the anti-colic bottles I've come across, there are quite a few pieces to clean, so just be prepared for that. I don't find it to be a bother, because I think the benefit of reducing gas for my little ones helps them sleep so much better, so it's worth the extra time. Overall these have held up fairly well and I haven't had to replace any parts so far!",
