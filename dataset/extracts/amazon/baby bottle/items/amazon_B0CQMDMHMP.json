        "description": "Inspired by moms and designed by experts, our Natural Start Anti-Colic Baby Bottle has an extra-wide neck and breast-like nipple to help your baby have the most natural bottle-feeding experience. Made from super soft silicone, the nipple is Closer to Nature because it has a special breast-like shape that encourages a natural latch and prevents nipple confusion when switching between bottle and breast. This works by mimicking the flex and movement of mom\u2019s breast, allowing your baby to feed at a pace that feels comfortable and natural to them. It also features an anti-colic valve to prevent the symptoms of colic by ensuring your little one ingests more milk and less air. For added peace of mind, the Natural Start baby bottle is completely mess-free and leakproof when the screw ring, nipple and cap are all secured (even if it\u2019s turned upside down or shaken). It\u2019s also 100% BPA free so it\u2019s safe for your baby. However, you choose to feed your baby - whether it\u2019s breast milk, formula or a bit of both - our Natural Start Anti-Colic bottles are #1 for easily switching between bottle and breast*. *Based on an independent survey of 1,006 UK moms of 0-12m who have used bottles, Feb 2023.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, about the reviews with the nipple collapsing, milk leaking, and/or baby not getting anything: make sure the squeeze the valve before putting it inthe bottle to assure its open. Takes litterally a sec. Also, double check you screwed on the bottle top correctly, it can easily get off course and leak. Other than that, it's actually really easy to clean and put together! These bottles really saved my sleep. My son was born 5 weeks early and has tummy issues. First we had to get him on sensitive formula, but he was still squirming in gas pain and projectile spitting up. Me, my husband, and two year old never got any sleep.... My pediatrician suggested these and i noticed IMMEDIATE improvements! He sleeps and smiles now! No more crazy spit up, no more gas pain... So if your dealing with a baby who easily gets colickly or just has a sensitive tummy, these are your bottles. Get them.A/N: Also, don't shake the bottle if your mixing formula.. I measure and mix up formula in a separate pitcher and then pour them into the bottles. Reducing air bubbles makes a difference.",

                "reviewText": "My baby was strictly on demand breast the first 3 months of her life until I went make to work from maternity leave. I wish I would have introduced a bottle earlier to her and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had so many issues. I tried MULTIPLE bottles listed in the picture and more. She just would not latch to any of them.Then after long painful hours, a ton of tears from both of us, and multiple orders off Amazon we finally found a nipple she would latch to. This bottle has been a godsend. I\u2019m not putting down the other bottles at all I read great reviews that\u2019s why I tried and bought those. It\u2019s just the fact that this one resembles the breast the most which was awesome.The bottle does not leak unless it is human error. There is a few extra pieces than \u201cplain\u201d bottles but completely worth it. I prefer to clean a little more knowing my baby is happy, healthy, fed, and feeling well.",

                "reviewText": "I have exclusively my son since birth. However, for the first few weeks, he had a hard time latching on (he was born a \"tongue-sucker\" and with an high palate) and took him a couple of weeks (and many lactation consults,assertive devices, and tears before success. while he ended a great nurser, I was warned by many \"professionals and family against any bottle feedings. however, I had to return to woks seeks after birth, and only way I could give him breastmilk only was to pump and have my mother feed him from bottle several times a day. i purchased several different bottle brands, (Advent, and others advertised to avoid nipple confusion and mimics the breast; including \"Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature\" bottle, (Be careful package is labeled \"Sensitive Tummy Bottle\" with picture of tube and valve system, which is critical in reduction off air bubbles that can cause air bubbles in tummy, discomfort, and increased spit up. Additionally, it makes a \"whistle\" sound if improperly fed and valve turns red if temperature rises above 98\u00b0F. All these features resulted in the only bottle which reduced/eliminated extra air in tummy, decreased spit up, and was able to successfully alternate between bottle and breastfeeding. The bottle needs to be assembled exactly per instructions, which took a bit to master, but crucial for it to work. From six weeks old and continuing currently at 12 months old; they have held up, and he still successfully uses. The only negative but avoidable issue I found was the small, clear, wheel-shaped bottom piece of valve blends in with water when washing, is and I have lost a few. I have not found replacements to buy, so had to purchase of few extra bottles to replace it. Although frustrating at time- in the end was nice to have entire new bottles, which are affordable. The bottles themselves have a wide opening and any standard bottle brush works. The valves and nipples need to be cleaned with a specific narrow brush, (included with every bottle purchased), but entire bottle is simple to clean. If purchase a bottle warmer, make sure the width dimensions allow the bottle to fit inside. finally, I cannot stress how these bottles are HUGE factor in the success I had returning to work, transition daily feedings between bottle and without infant discomfort or refusal to feed either way!",
