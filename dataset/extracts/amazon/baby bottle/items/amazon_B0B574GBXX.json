                "reviewText": "Everything about this bottle is wrong!! There is huge design flaw. Bottle opening is too small you have to use funnel provided otherwise you will spill formula everywhere. Of course its extra part to wash and sanitize. Its also very difficult go clean bottle due to small opening. Cap is the most difficult to open out of 5 baby bottles I tried. Sometimes even my husband cant open it and has to use tool to open. If you close the bottle too tight, formula will squirt out of nipple. You have to tighten it very carefully. If its too loose, it will leak. Also bottle is long and narrow which makes it easy to tip over and break. The bottle is thinner than any other glass bottle. It also wont fit it steam sterilizer.Why am I using this despite of my complaints above? My breastfed baby wont take any other bottle but this! Try all other brans first before you give this bottle to your baby. There are way better products out there. Avoid this if you have alternatives!!",
