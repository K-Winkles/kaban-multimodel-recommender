                "reviewText": "No this product is not for every baby at every age. So many people are giving this product a bad review based on an improper experience. My friend bought these bottles when her daughter was born and had to wait until her daughter was 6 months old to be able to use them. A younger child will not have the sucking strength to use these bottle. Definitely not for newborns. These bottles seem to be best suited for breastfed babies. As breastfed babies are used to waiting for a let down for milk. The baby will have to continue to suck to keep the milk flowing through the tubing. But the milk does not completely fall from the tubing and milk does stay in the nipple. So it may not be constant instant gratification but these bottles are well worth it if you have a great sucker and a child who is old enough to use them. Again these bottles are not suited for brand new babies I personally would not even bother offering them to a baby under 6 month old.ALSO YOU CAN USE THE DR. BROWNS SIPPY NIPPLE WITH THIS SYSTEM. MY AON LOVES IT.",

With my newest purchase for my youngest (6 mos old), I was disappointed because the nipple leaked so much. Overall I love the idea of this bottle however, I think the nipple preference is dependent on the baby. Mine unfortunately didn't do so well.",
