                "reviewText": "This review may be a little lengthy but I\u2019m gonna go into all the details about how these products have changed my life.I\u2019d like to start by saying this Newborn Bottle Starter set is the perfect gift for all the breastfeeding moms out there. It comes with 4 thick plastic bottles with breast like nipples and nipple covers and storage caps that are super easy to assemble, a ELECTRIC FREE bottle warmer that\u2019s easy to use, a few samples of pumping bags that Nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 sells, 2 pacifiers (which my baby is absolutely in love with) and pump adapters for every pump on the market that allow you to pump straight in the bottle.My daughter was born 3 weeks early and we had issues latching from what we recently found out was due to a lip tie. For a while, we were having to pace feed her with a syringe and a bottle nipple and she lost a lot of weight in her first few weeks after birth. My friend gifted me with a lot of different top name brand bottles (some with anticolic and what was claimed to be \u201cslow flow\u201d) but every one we tried would choke her up. I decided to research different bottles and came across the Nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 Breastfeeding Bottles and bought the Newborn Starter Kit to give them a shot. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. These nipples actually allowed me to pace feed her without choking her up and the bottle warmer it comes with makes heating up refrigerated breastmilk a breeze. The shape of the bottles is perfect for my hands that cramp and lock up easily from tendinitis and early arthritis and carpal tunnel issues and also allows for super easy stacking storage in the cabinet as well as in the fridge. The breastmilk bags, I\u2019ve recently discovered are also space saving as well because they lay flat and I can stack them on top rather than standing them upright like other bags that take up so much room in my fridge. I plan on purchasing more breastmilk bags and a storage organizer for my freezer. Also, the fact that every purchase of bottles I\u2019ve got (I got the starter kit and two 3 packs of the breastmilk bottles) comes with a pump adapter so you can actually pump into the bottles, even if you only buy the bottles. And the pacifiers are the closest to the hospital grade without the bulk that I\u2019ve been able to find. My daughter WILL NOT take any pacifier other than her Nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 pacifiers.If you\u2019re thinking about purchasing these, they\u2019re definitely worth it and I HIGHLY recommend these bottles over any other bottles on the market.Pro tip: a lot of reviews on here will say they leak but that\u2019s only if you don\u2019t close the bottle bottom properly. The way these bottles are built make washing them so much easier and I\u2019ve had very little to no issues with leaking from the base. The starter kit comes with a lot of helpful little information packets that tell you how to and how not to use the products to make using them easier.",

                "reviewText": "We love this bottle!! We were looking for a bottle that would assist in allowing me some value resting time while also not giving nipple confusion to our newborn son. We bought these and they have worked out great! The only thing I would suggest and it definitely isn\u2019t a bad thing just a important reminder is to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS: this isn\u2019t something I thought you would need to do with a bottle but it is. My first day of milk coming in I managed to pump 4 oz of milk. It was painful, hard, and tiring. This bottle was going to be my first night of more than a hour of sleep while my husband stayed up to feed baby and bond with our son. 1am hits and Zeke is screaming he is hungry. My husband jumps up and heads to the kitchen to retrieve the bottle from fridge. While I was pumping I used the storage cap and not the nipple attachment. So my husband gets the container and proceeds to heat up some water to put it in to warm the milk. Half asleep and not reading the instructions he missed the warning on the storage cap that said do not heat up with cap on. So as he headed to the room to grab our son the bottom of the bottle popped off and all the precious milk spills out. He is trying to put the bottom back on and it just keeps popping off. At this point I\u2019m awake and watching the horror as I try to refrain from crying because I knew it would only upset my poor husband more. I simply say help me up and I sit down in the glider to feed our son. My husband sat up the entire time he felt so bad. The next morning we get the instructions out and it clearly explains to heat up with nipple attachment. After learning this the feeding as gone great. My husband gets skin to skin bonding and feeding with our son and I get close to 4 hours solid sleep and there has been no issue with my son switching from bottle to boob! I highly recommend this product and plan on buying other products from this company!",

                "reviewText": "Nanobebe review- [ ] We purchased the Nanobebe system for baby number eight. With literally every child before we used the same exact feeding system but wanted to try something new HOWEVER we were only willing to switch for the right system (good design and easy on babies stomach with no gulping air, etc). I ordered a few bottles early in pregnancy so I could get to understand them in advance and then we ordered all of the parts of the system (bottles, storage bags, carrying case, storage rack, pacifiers - EVERYTHING). The thing that stands out about the system of course is the design, it\u2019s modern and more aligned with breastfeeding. Plus the design of the bottles makes it easy to ensure that every portion of the bottle is TRULY clean and sanitized. You just have to make sure that you push firmly and close the base tightly. The milk warmer works quickly and all I do is add hot water and throw in either the bottle or the bag of stored milk. I really appreciate the adapters that make it easy to connect with my Medela breast pump. And the storage bags are durable which is great for freezing breast milk and ensuring it\u2019s quality when thawed. The part that has me committed to the system permanently is that my little one loves it. She was born prematurely and has struggles with feeding. The nipples work great for her and the Nanobebe pacifiers are the only ones that she will accept comfortably. I also love that there is a carrying case made specifically for the bottles considering their unique shape. Having that ability to keep milk chilled in the case while you\u2019re out is an extra bonus. I\u2019m looking forward to purchasing the newer flex bottles once our little one has grow more.",

My baby took to the dummy and bottles straight away the teats and dummy definitely have a breast like feeling to them so was easy for my baby to get used to them immediately. Comes with everything stated in the picture and instructions are easy to follow. Will definitely be sticking to nanobebe for the future thank you!!",
