Designed to mimic the fit, flow, and movement of mom as closely as possible, this is the only bottle with up to 9 nipple holes, just like mom. This provides a natural feeding experience to ensure the mom-baby bond remains strong. NUK\u00ae Simply Natural\u2122 bottles feature a super-soft nipple that mimics the shape of mom's breast while breastfeeding. The scoop nipple cavity allows space for baby's tongue and jaw to move naturally, just like they do when breastfeeding. Now NUK\u00ae Simply Natural\u2122 bottles feature SafeTemp technology, which lets you know when milk is too hot. The blue thermometer indicator fades when milk is too hot and reappears when milk has cooled and is safe to drink.",

                "reviewText": "If you are breastfeeding and bottle feeding and want to avoid nipple confusion these are literally the best out there. Because of the bottle nipple design and how it flattens out like a natural breast would it doesn't allow for confusion. It also has multiple holes just as a mothers breast has for identical fluid flow. I have heard nightmare stories about babies not wanting breast after bottle feeding as well as not wanted bottle after breast feeding. These allowed us to do both, no matter time of day, all the way up to 8 months old when I weaned our daughter due to biting issues and me scaring her when I let out a loud scream. So she no longer wanting to latch, which was heartbreaking. But from birth to 8 months these were amazing. They grow with baby and have slow, medium, and fast flow nipple options. Daughter now 9 months old we are still using the bottles and have them all switched to fast flow. I believe there are sippy cup tops for them too. As well as handles to attach to the bottom to help us transition to toddler years. Highly recommend. They are also easy to clean even in dishwasher and do not get that filmy color.",

                "reviewText": "Amazing product just thought it was glass...We have the glass ones and we prefer glass even if glass doesn't last us. We only have 1 glass Nuk bottle left so we bought these with 6 thinking it was the glass. We don't have anymore bottles and we do well on the only one we have left...sadly, for us..we will return and get the glass ones. Also because 1 won't do for two babies. Trust me when I say glass won't last you, they expensive and they do just as well as plastic but they heavy and baby cannot feed themselves with them because they will break it. I never let my child touch the glass ones but it is our preferred bottle.back to these plastic Nuk bottles I accidentally purchased... Nothing is wrong with them! They are in perfect condition. Just as my glass bottles came in. You have to wash them and is all good!",

I love that the bottles stays crystal clear and does not cloud overtime, and the capacity to hold 150ml is great compare to other brand that holds 120ml only. The only con is that the measuring lines are hard to see when filling up the bottles with liquid formula or milk. I wish the markings are in darker shade as it contrast better with the color of the milk.",
