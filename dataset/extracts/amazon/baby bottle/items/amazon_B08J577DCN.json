Squeeze me When assembling your baby bottle, hold the nipple up to the light to check the slit in the silicone isn\u2019t sealed closed.

The nipple prevent too much air getting in so less burning and gas. . Tommy tippee is a brand that I\u2019ve trusted from almost 40 years ago when my son was born. I got this bundle of 2 lg, 2 small bottles + 2 pacifiers.at a promo price of about $19.00. What a great deal, which made it even more desirable. However,, I would highly recommend them at the full price! I will buy again for gift-giving. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "My baby was exclusively breastfed for a little too long, so when we tried to introduce the bottle, she refused it. This was a nightmare for my husband when I would go to work. She was hungry, she would cry, but she would refuse every bottle he tried to give to her.We tried the avent bottles, comotomo, dr browns, mam, and the emulait bottle which was supposed to be the closest thing to a breast that we could find. We even got creative and tried feeding her with a syringe and a little cup. She refused them all. Finally, we tried this bottle, not expecting much, but for whatever reason my baby started drinking milk from these bottles little by little. At first it was just an ounce or two, but now she\u2019s drinking 6 ozs from it in one sitting. So, if you\u2019re dealing with bottle refusal, these are worth a try.",
