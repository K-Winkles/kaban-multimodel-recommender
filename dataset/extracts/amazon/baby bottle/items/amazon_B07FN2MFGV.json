                "reviewText": "We returned this size because our LO needed more formula than these offered but, these bottles saved the day and were one of the reasons that my baby easily transitioned between breast and bottle. The previous research and reviews did not lie. These bottles are loved by my baby as well as have many parent approved qualities. They are easy to clean (with a built in ability to sanitize). The vent function works to help prevent air within the bottle. You will still need to make sure that the milk is going into the nipple. Overall, the bottles are aesthetic as well as come in all of the variety you need to not purchase an abundance of bottling supplies.The only downfalls (if you will) are that the bottles do not heat well in a bottle warmer due to the thicker plastic base. You are not able to see the one ounce mark on the bottle itself, the included cap however is beneficial here.",

Otherwise they get moldy because there is a part on the inside that acts like a seal that you have to take out and clean every single time. It also keeps the bottles from getting gross.They were really easy for the babies to hold because they were nice and wide and in my opinion are better than the skinny Dr. Brown\u2019s bottles that are hard to hold because they\u2019re a little fat arms. Can\u2019t get that close together to hold them.",
