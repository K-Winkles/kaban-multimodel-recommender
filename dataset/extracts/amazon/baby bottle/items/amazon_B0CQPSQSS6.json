I love that this cup can be completely taken apart and cleaned thoroughly. No risk of mold forming. We mostly put water in it, but we have put other things like smoothies as well with no issues. The only two things that are annoying is the handles don\u2019t lock in place so it can get kind of awkward with their positioning versus where the straw is and the other thing is my son loves to throw his cup when he\u2019s done eating and the straw cover almost always comes off. It does snap right back into position but a little annoying because if you\u2019re not paying attention it can easily be lost.I\u2019ve only had it leak a couple times, but I realized that if you don\u2019t pull the straw all the way to where it \u201cpops\u201d into position when you\u2019re putting it together it will leak. That was a user error.",

And your child has to bite down in just the right spot on the straw to drink otherwise it is pretty hard to get liquid from. Where they have to bite it pretty close to the top of the straw so I feel like babies transitioning from a bottle naturally put the straw in their mouths and bite in a different spot.",

You have to make sure a majority of the straw that is sticking out is in baby\u2019s mouth for them to be able to suck water out. The only downside is I put some baby food pur\u00e9e on the straw while he was learning to use the cup and it stained the straw.",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite straw sippy cup for my toddler.I have tried many other brands and they all leaked or didn\u2019t survive been thrown around!This is the only one I\u2019ve found to NOT leak, which was the most important factor for me because I have to carry it in my diaper bag and I\u2019ve had other cups leak all over my bag!I had to find a cup that had a lid go over the top for this reason- I need it to be portable.My daughter has thrown this cup off her high chair table so many times I\u2019ve lost count and it\u2019s never gotten cracked.!She can drink out of it very easily. You do have to somewhat bite down on the straw in order to suck but this is how it is supposed to be fir a toddler/ baby learning to suck from a straw.Other negative reviews I\u2019ve seen of this being a problem - they obvydidmt realize that that\u2019s how it is supposed to be!! I thought the same at first but every straw cup that\u2019s a transitional cup has this feature! It is meant to be like this so remember that!!I love that it has the handle so she can hold it well and then when and if you need to you can take it off.I honestly can\u2019t recommend this OXO tot cup enough!It\u2019s by far the best one out there! Don\u2019t look any further!",

As long as the straw is pulled through all the way, it does not leak or spill, which is awesome! The straw is kind of hard to clean, but I\u2019ll take it over a leaky cup any day.",

                "reviewText": "Okay so I need to say that I removed the top cover because whenever I would slide the cover over the straw, it would pinch the straw in the most perfect way to make it leak! But without that cover, I am so so happy that it DOES NOT leak. Like ever. We've been using it for 9 months and it's holding up great. Even when it has cold liquid and then that cold liquid gets warmer and warmer and rises up into the straw like any other straw cup... It will not leak. Unless maybe the end of the straw gets damaged by toddlers chewing on it. But anyway. I was really in need of another one and I didn't see any of the 9oz blue on amazon.ca so I over-paid to get one from amazon.com because that's how much I love that it doesn't leak! Oh and very easy to clean! Happy customer here. The lid is long gone so I just pretend it didn't even have one ;)",
