                "reviewText": "As a parent, finding the right bottle for your newborn can feel like a quest for the holy grail, especially when dealing with the dreaded colic that disrupts many babies' early days. My journey led me to Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Anti-Colic Options+ Narrow Baby Bottle, a choice that has proven to be a blessing for both my baby and me.What sets these bottles apart is their innovative green anti-colic filter, designed to minimize the air intake during feeding, a common culprit behind colic symptoms. This thoughtful feature has been a game-changer, ensuring that feeding times are comfortable and calm, devoid of the fussiness and discomfort that can accompany swallowed air. The result? Peaceful, uninterrupted feeds and a content baby, which is all a parent could ask for.My experience with Dr. Brown's bottles has been overwhelmingly positive from day one. The assurance that comes from knowing my child is less likely to suffer from colic symptoms is invaluable. The design of these bottles deserves special mention too; they're not just functional but also come with the most adorable squirrel and goat designs that add a touch of whimsy to our feeding routine.The bottles' 8 oz capacity is another feature I appreciate. It's perfect for adapting to my baby's growing appetite, eliminating the need to switch to larger bottles as he gets older. This versatility, combined with the slow flow nipple suited for newborns, makes these bottles a practical choice for long-term use.Ease of cleaning and assembly is crucial for any baby bottle, and Dr. Brown's doesn't disappoint. The anti-colic filter, while an additional part to clean, is a small trade-off for the benefits it provides. The bottles are also BPA free, addressing any concerns about harmful chemicals.In summary, Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Anti-Colic Options+ Bottles have been a cornerstone of our feeding routine, providing not just a solution to potential colic but also a delightful design and practical features that cater to a growing baby's needs. If you're navigating the vast world of baby bottles, consider giving these a try for a blend of function and fun that will make feeding time something to look forward to.",

                "reviewText": "I have used Dr. Brown's bottles for all of my kids, and they don't disappoint. With the birth of my newest baby, I needed to replace the bottles I had since I had gotten rid of them all years prior. The bottles have changed design a bit over the years, but they do an excellent job at helping to keep the amount of air their take in to a minimum, which in turn helps to make for less gassy and happier babies. The internal parts are a little bit of a pain to keep clean, but the bottles can function with and without them. As my baby's get older, I eventually stop using the internal parts and just use them as a regular bottle. But when my kids are younger and colic is a lot more of a problem, those parts make a world of difference and are worth the extra time it takes to clean them. I'm not planning on any more kids after this one, but if I did, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "We used Dr. Brown's bottles for my son since he was a newborn. The bottles are notorious for being harder to clean because of the anti-colic \"straws\", but you have the option to not use these. We only started using the larger 8 oz size for feedings when my LO was an older infant and drinking larger amounts. These would be hilariously large for a newborn. You can always choose to use these for storing expressed breastmilk as well. Nonetheless, a classic staple for our family and these bottles have cute gender neutral designs. For the price, I do wish it also came with the travel caps to prevent leaks!",

                "reviewText": "These bottles came highly recommended by multiple people, including a pediatrician. We are happy to report that we have a less \"gassy\" baby after using these bottles. The baby latched easily to the natural-like nipple. The flow is excellent. The only \"negative\" I can give the bottles is my own uncertainty that I am getting the bottles completely sterilized. The straw/filter used to reduce air intake needs some additional attention. I have since ordered Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Reusable Baby Bottle Vent System and Reservoir Cleaning Bristle Brushes. These brushes help me feel more confident that my bottles are truly clean.",

Despite the anti colic feature it is still easy to clean which is so important to most parents..anything that makes the job easier is worth trying so I\u2019d say this doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easier but also doesn\u2019t make it any harder plus you have the added anti colic feature. Love the neutral colored design too and the bottles are the perfect size.",
