                "reviewText": "My baby is formula fed and deals with a lot of gas pains so a good bottle is a must for her. We have tried almost all brands out there with her and the Nuk bottles have worked the best. They are really easy to clean, dry, and assemble back together because they only have 4 parts (cap, nipple, rim, bottle). It is a light weight bottle so holding on to it while baby feeds is convenient. Also, out of all the bottles we have tried, the nipple on the Nuk bottles have worked the best. Not only does my baby properly latch without spilling but it keeps her from eating too fast. The nipple also has a small hole were trapped air can escape which is great for gassy babies to not take in as much air between feedings. In addition, the bottle itself has a blue temperature line that turn white when the milk or bottle is too hot and does a great job at indicating when the temperature is ok for baby by turning blue again when it\u2019s a safe level. The Nuk bottles have worked so well for use that we have bought a total of 5 sets and only have to wash them once a day or two depending on how much baby girl eats any given day (we feed on demand). Definitely recommend based on quality and value!",

                "reviewText": "I see a lot of these reviews and think that people are perhaps misunderstanding how breastfeeding and bottle-feeding vary among infants. Every baby is different, every mouth is different, every breast is different, and every latch is unique. A bottle that works for my baby may not work for yours, but that doesn't mean the bottle is bad. You may have to try a few before finding the right one.I like this bottle for us. My baby is a pretty easy feeder and has good suction. We wanted bottles that would let him feed slowly. These work well for that. They've helped us minimize spit up. For us, these worked better than the Tommee Tippee or Avent or Dr. Brown. Definitely make sure you get the right size nipple, though!If you want some advice from my genius lactation doctor... One of the best things you can do with bottle feeding is just go slow. Really slow. Breastfeeding is not an instant or fast process for babies. It takes a minute for milk to let down, the flow changes throughout the feed, there are starts and stops in the process, etc. If you're testing out a new bottle, try to imitate that process. Give the baby the bottle, but don't immediately let the milk flow to the nipple. Take breaks if your baby allows it, and if not, incline them a bit so they're not getting a full flow. Do some gentle burps. Maybe change their diaper in the middle of the feed rather than right before. If you do that, you'll get a good idea of how well the bottle is working AND, bonus, when you breastfeed, you'll have a baby accustomed to a normal pace so they won't get frustrated at how slow the process is!",

I also use cereal in his bottle , so if you only using milk pls make sure you\u2019re baby can handle the flow . The Y shape is made for cereal bottles .",

                "reviewText": "Upon opening the package and inspecting the bottles, I noticed light scratches on the bottle already. I was very hesitant to use it but the box did say \"New\" on the label. I made sure to give it a good wash and sanitized in hot boiling water before using. The plastic part that holds the nipple in feels cheaply made and cant get a good grip on it when trying to open and close the bottle. I'm not sure if it's smooth controlled flow, I tried the first bottle with my son and it came way too fast which I thought he was probably just got to get use to it. Second bottle same thing, flow came too fast, I squeezed the top of the bottle nipple of the Y shape and milk came pouring out. Not sure if we will use it again since he is only 4 months. We will have to wait until he is older and can drink at a faster flow to use it.",
