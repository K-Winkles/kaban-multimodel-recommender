I got these screw caps to store my breastmilk correctly. These screw caps work great for Avent wide mouth bottles. Avent doesn\u2019t include screw caps with their bottles, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to purchase screw caps separately. The screw caps helps cut down on washing parts because I can now pump directly into the bottle and then put the screw caps on afterwards. The screw caps are great as one piece because I won\u2019t lose a part. The cap doesn\u2019t leak because there is an o-ring inside to keep the seal tight.",

While there are definite positives to these lids, I've also encountered a few minor drawbacks, which is why I'm giving them a 4-star review. These screw lids are a handy addition for parents who are often on the move. They offer a convenient way to seal baby bottles, preventing spills and leaks during travel. The rewritable sealing disc is a great idea, but I noticed that it can wear out or become less effective after a few uses.",
