        "description": "Philips Avent Natural bottle with the Natural Response nipple lets baby control the pace of the milk, like they do when breastfeeding. The nipples' unique opening and tip only releases milk when your baby actively drinks. When pausing to swallow and breathe no milk flows. Baby can drink, swallow, and breathe using their natural rhythm, just like they do when breastfeeding. Easily combine breast and bottle feeding with a wide breast-shaped nipple with a soft feel that mimics the shape and feel of a breast; plus baby controlling the flow of milk like they do when breastfeeding. The nipple has a no-drip design which helps prevent lost milk from the tip. An anti-colic valve integrated into the nipple is designed to reduce colic and discomfort by sending air away from your baby's tummy. The ergonomic shape makes it comfortable for parents to hold and easy for small fingers to grasp. Assembly is simple with only a few parts and the wide bottle neck makes filling and cleaning easy. The Natural bottle is made from polypropylene, a BPA free material, and works with all nipples and caps from the Natural line. The Natural response nipples come in flow rates 1-5, to keep up with your baby's growth. Includes: 4 9oz Natural bottles with Natural Response nipples, flow 3. SCY903/04 What to expect when introducing the Philips Avent Natural Response Nipple It is totally natural for your baby to take 2-3 tries to get milk flowing from a new bottle. Unlike traditional bottles the Natural bottle is designed to only release milk when your baby is actively drinking, like what happens when babies breastfeed. We have 5 different nipple flow rates for the Natural bottle. When looking for the right nipple flow rate, age is a guide, but your baby's approach to drinking and the feeding cues they will show will help determine when to move to a higher or lower nipple flow rate.",

They don't leak, they help with gas, they're easy to clean, they hold a lot, and they're sturdy. I personally like that there are only 3 parts. I've bought more since my first purchase. However, I'd suggest buying a slower nipple if you have a newborn. My 3 month old took fine to the 3 level though since being a newborn. The only thing that I personally don't like is the way the nipple is made. It's a little awkward to wash but that's just something I don't personally like.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I started searching for a new baby bottle after the one I had (\"Dr. brand\") had major issues.I was hesitant to spend money on a new bottle, but I am extremely happy I went with this one.Absolutely no regrets. This is THE ONE. I should have got this sooner/first.I can't imagine a better bottle than this in terms of replicating a real nipple (I easily notice the higher quality in the material), ease of cleaning, and how attractive the bottle looks (the blue is so beautiful!!) -- and of course, a highly reputable well established brand.I was worried at first about the different nipple sizes. The default one that comes with this is \"Flow 3\" which is the middle level, targeted for 1 month old.My baby gobbles up milk like a starving child every time; this nipple works fine for him.He can finish the 4 oz milk less than 10 minutes, which is good. If it takes longer than 30 minutes to feed your baby, that's not right, and exhausting for the parent too.It doesn't make weird sounds when he's drinking and and it doesn't drip. There's no milk wasted either. So much better than the lame Dr. brand I was using before; that one also had so many parts to clean, it was more work.The top cap has a thumb grip area, which can still be a little difficult to open if it's wet. I also notice the silicone has a bit of certain odor when you get it.Philips AVENT is easily one of the best baby bottles on the market. It's the perfect gift - must have for any parents out there.It's life changing. It will make feeding time more convenient and a pleasure for you. It's worth spending extra considering you're going to be feeding your baby so many times. It was definitely worth the investment.",

                "reviewText": "Love these bottles! I bought them for my son and his wife who recently had a baby. She\u2019s now 6 and a half months old. They work great! No leaking, and easy to clean.Just an FYI. The green bottles are for 0-3 months and purple bottles are for 3 months and up. Please note, they have both USA and European measurements on the bottles. So if you\u2019re looking at the bottle the US measuring system is on the right (in ounces) and European (which is slightly less) on the left, but the measurements are side by side so it might be a bit confusing at first, unless you know what to look for.",

                "reviewText": "The Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle has been an absolute lifesaver for me and my little one. As a parent, finding the right bottle that provides comfort, convenience, and a natural feeding experience is essential, and this product delivers on all fronts. The Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle is a fantastic choice for newborns and infants, offering a clear design, a natural response nipple, and a convenient 4-pack set.One of the standout features of this baby bottle is its natural response nipple. Designed to mimic the shape and feel of a mother's breast, it promotes a smooth and comfortable feeding experience for the baby. The wide, breast-shaped nipple allows for an easy latch, making the transition between breast and bottle feeding seamless. It also has an anti-colic valve that reduces air ingestion and discomfort during feeding, helping to minimize colic symptoms.The 4-ounce capacity of each bottle is perfect for newborns and young infants. It allows for controlled portion sizes and helps prevent overfeeding. The clear design of the bottle makes it easy to see the liquid level, ensuring you can monitor your baby's intake during feedings.The quality of the Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle is exceptional. The bottles are made from BPA-free materials, providing peace of mind in terms of safety. They are also easy to clean, as they can be disassembled into fewer parts compared to other bottles on the market. This makes sterilization and washing a breeze, especially during those busy parenting moments.The 4-pack set is a great value for money. Having multiple bottles on hand means you can prepare multiple feedings in advance or have spares readily available. This is particularly useful for nighttime feedings or when you're on the go. The bottles are compatible with other Philips AVENT products, such as breast pumps and bottle warmers, adding to their versatility and convenience.Overall, the Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle is a fantastic choice for parents looking for a reliable, safe, and comfortable feeding solution for their little ones. Its natural response nipple, clear design, and convenient 4-pack set make it an ideal option for newborns and infants. I highly recommend the Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle for its quality, ease of use, and the peace of mind it provides during feeding times.Note: This review is based on my personal experience with the Philips AVENT Natural Baby Bottle and reflects my honest and unbiased opinion.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got these to use with my newest gs. They are so nice because they are wide which makes it so much easier to fill. We use breast milk and supplement with formula so pouring from bags as well as putting in scoops of powdered formula is so much easier and you don't waste it by spilling it trying to get it into a standard size bottle neck. Another giant advantage for me is being able to actually read the numbers to measure. The light blue is a nice faint shade, they are easy to hold and see how much milk is actually in the nipple so they don't get a bunch of air, which helps on too much gas. The nipples it comes with have a good shape that is more natural and soft against his face. He actually likes these best. They are also easier to clean and sturdy enough to last for years through multiple babies and the nipples can be replaced very easy as needed. They are a really good quality which makes the price worth it. I'm very happy with them I highly recommend these and I hope this info helps you.",
