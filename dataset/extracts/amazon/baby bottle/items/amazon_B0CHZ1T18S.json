Ventaire bottles are designed with doctor-recommended features that help prevent colic and reflux. The patented bottom vent promotes an air-free feed, and the ergonomic, angled design promotes semi-upright feeding to help prevent ear infections. Unlike nipple vented bottles, VentAire's bottom vent keeps air at the back of the bottle and prevents it from mixing with Milk as your baby drinks. Less air bubbles in your baby's milk means Reduced colic, reflux, gas, burping and fussiness. Playtex Baby offers a variety of uniquely designed bottles that meet all of your baby's changing feeding needs. All Playtex baby products are BPA, PVC and phthalate free.",
