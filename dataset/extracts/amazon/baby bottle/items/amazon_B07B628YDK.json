He couldn't latch onto them properly and was getting too much air which was causing horrible gas issues.. desperate, I bought these and he LOVES them and latched properly right away and no air issues or sunken nipples!!! The only cons is the opening of the bottle is very narrow so it makes it hard to clean them with a bottle brush , or to dispense formula without spilling some. Also amazon charges an arm and leg for them when you can get them at Walmart for literally $1 a piece so I will be buying them from Walmart for now on!",

                "reviewText": "Like previous reviewers have said, these bottles are available cheaper at Walmart than here on Amazon, and these work with Medela pumping parts so pumping moms can pump straight into the bottle for their babies. They have also been very accurate as far as the measurements on the side if you are tracking how much you pump, the only thing is the measurements are in increments of ounces or 30, so if you need more precise measures, you will have to use a different container. The nipples are sturdy and last a while, as well. Ive used these with all three of my children who were primarily breastfed and have not encountered nipple confusion or bottle refusing when using these. I prefer to use the 5 ounce bottles, but have also used the bigger bottles in the past, and both hold up very well over time. I will continue to buy these bottles for as long as i have children who need one (but probably bought straight from Walmart to save a bit of money). Photos show the measurments in PC bottle and one that comes with the Medela starter kit. The PC bottle is just uner the 2 ounce mark and the Medela shows a measurment between 50 and 60 ml.",
