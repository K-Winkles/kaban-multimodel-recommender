Our bottles provide a more comfortable feeding experience for the baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and silicone nipples provide a consistent flow so the baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. Our vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aids in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. The silicone nipple, together with the internal vent system, offer a reliable and trusted bottle feeding experience.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE THESE BOTTLES. Once we started using these spit up and gas disappeared almost completely. She doesn't leak formula out of her mouth now when she eats and feeding time is easier for her as well as for us. The bottles are not only cute but the white thing in the top keeps the air out, and keeps the bottle from spilling all over the place you can hold them upside down and they won't leak. They are the BEST bottles for any newborn and I highly recommend them until the baby is eating 4 oz these are the bottles you need to use. {We do use Doc Brown nipples with them but the other nipples work just fine. I just prefer the slow flow nipples from Doc Brown for newborns and love that the Doc Brown nipples have stages to them so they are our nipples of choice, and there is nothing wrong with the nipples that come with these bottles}",

                "reviewText": "There are four tiny 2 ounce bottles included, This size is convenient and not so easy to find! They are quality bottles with a unique vent system that keep bubbles from passing to the nipple. I did replace the nipple with preferred standard bottle nipples-easy low cost fix. Since the bottles are such a great price, it didn\u2019t bother me to replace the nipples. The ones that came with the bottles are softer than we prefer. Overall, I highly recommend these for newborns, especially preemies.",
