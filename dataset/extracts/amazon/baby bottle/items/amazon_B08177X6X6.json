I've not gotten a chance to use these specific bottles as my little one has not arrived yet, but I'm very impressed with the product and the interchangeable nipples to get the correct flow for your little one. I've read a lot of other great reviews on this product and I'm super excited to use them!",

                "reviewText": "From weeks 4 to 5 of my baby's life I pumped and bottle fed almost exclusively. Yesterday I put him back to breast - there was a brief learning curve for me as I needed to get him to latch more deeply to avoid him gumming down on my nipple, but after only 12 hours he is comfortably back at breast and doing great. He does clearly work a little harder at breast, but he latches well and accepts it readily. It's nice to know I can transition between bottle and breast without any issues thanks to these bottles!These bottles are very easy to clean. I love that they are glass - avoids more plastic garbage and I believe is healthier for less exposure to plastics overall. And I love that they have a multi-stage use, so even when my baby is bigger I won't have a bunch of old bottles sitting around. I do wish they made the smaller size in glass as well, but the full size isn't bad because the length allows me to do some one-handed feeds.Would buy again - and I have, I purchased a few sets of these since we needed several to get through the week of only bottle feeding.",
