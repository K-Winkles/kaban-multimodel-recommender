                "reviewText": "If I spent as much time studying in school as I have researching baby cups I could have gotten a doctorates degree. And after everything... I still haven't found the perfect cup, but I haven't given up hope. I like this cup a lot, I got this cup when baby was 7 months to help transition from bottles to straws and cups, baby is 11 months now and I use this cup more than any others.Things I like: It's so cute! I really love the color and that its opaque so I can see how much liquid is in it. It's really easy for my baby to hold. The straw has a stopper so it cant be pulled out. It has a lid and it fits really well. It's super easy to clean (I only hand wash it as silicone can end up holding soap flavor). It has a flared bottom and that's always important. The cup has ounce markers.Things I don't like/wish were different: Volume, I wish it was a little larger, if you fill it too close to the top and put the lid on you will have an overflow, so I can only fill it 3/4th full and need to get a refill through dinner. If the cup is full and it tips over (a.k.a the baby throws it overboard) liquid will spill out of the straw. And lastly price, felt like a lot of money to spend on a cup... but I bought it anyway because I'm desperately seeking perfection.It's pretty good, until I find my perfect match, this one is at the top of my recommend list for a first transition cups.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 9 month old to start her using a straw. Its light weight and easy for her hold. The shape of the lid and bottom of the cup make it easy grab points for her to hold on to. And because of the silcon its easy nonslip for her to hold on to. She loves playing with the straw and it was easy for her to slurp up her first drink of water. Its a very durable cup and the lid stays secure. With many drops and throws onto the floor that lid stays on. It does leak from the straw but that is to be expected because its normal silcon straw. The straw does not have one of those stopper or restricters on them because its suppose to be an easy to suck straw. So expect liquid on the floor or table if left with the child unattended. My daughter loves to chew on the cup and straw which is actually encouraging her to want to play with the cup and use it more. It came with a sturdy straw cleaner which helps make the cleaning process even simpler. This cup is great and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my 10 month old twins. I wanted something they could easily hold, not pull the straw out of, and get the water up without a lot of force sucking. Having never used a straw before they took to these immediately! They are the perfect size (5 ounce) for them to grasp. They will leak if thrown on the floor but are fine if tipped over on their high chairs. They are also SUPER easy to clean with minimal parts and no fancy valves. Definitely worth the price.",

It has weighted bottom so the cup does not get knocked over so easily. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s leak proof cause some liquid does come out but not a lot very tiny. It\u2019s very easy to clean and it comes with a brush to clean the straw. I will be getting more colors for my little one.",

He does great getting the water out of this straw, but it does leak a lot from between the cup and the lid, and if it is turned upside down it leaks a lot too. We only give it to him in his high chair with a bib. It's a good size for him and he's able to hold it well even though there aren't handles.",
