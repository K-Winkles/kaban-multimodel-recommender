        "description": "A newborn starter set with a manatee sea design. Philips Avent Natural bottles with Natural Response nipple lets baby control the pace of the milk, like they do when breastfeeding. The nipples' unique opening and tip only releases milk when your baby actively drinks. When pausing to swallow and breathe no milk flows. Baby can drink, swallow, and breathe using their natural rhythm, just like they do when breastfeeding. Easily combine breast and bottle feeding with a wide breast-shaped nipple with a soft feel that mimics the shape and feel of a breast. A bottle brush with a curved brush head for easy cleaning of rounded bottle edges and a molded tip to clean the nipple. Soothie pacifiers are used by medical professionals to calm newborns, the durable pacifiers features hospital grade silicone. Our soft and lightweight snuggle pacifier holder helps babies feel secure and makes it easy to find the pacifier. Snuggle has two attachment options to hold any Philips Avent pacifier. The Natural bottle is made from polypropylene, a BPA free material, and works with all the Natural line nipples and caps. The Natural response nipples come in flow rates 1-5. Includes: 2 4oz Natural bottles with Natural response nipples flow 2, 2 9oz Natural bottles with a Manatee design with Natural response nipples flow 3, 1 Snuggle pacifier holder, 2 Soothie pacifiers 0-3 months, 1 bottle brush. SCD838/05 What to expect when introducing the Philips Avent Natural Response Nipple It is totally natural for your baby to take 2-3 tries to get milk flowing from a new bottle. Unlike traditional bottles the Natural bottle is designed to only release milk when your baby is actively drinking, like what happens when babies breastfeed. We have 5 different nipple flow rates for the Natural bottle. When looking for the right nipple flow rate, age is a guide, but your baby's approach to drinking and the feeding cues they will show will help determine when to move to a higher or lower nipple flow rate.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a few hours trying to find bottles/ nipples with a very slow flow, because my newborn daughter kept choking with the ones we already had. These bottles are the ones that kept coming up.Pros:1. They let her pause to breathe for a moment without me having to take the bottle from her, which was making her upset when I was using the other bottles.2. The slower flow seems to make her much less gassy, presumably because she's not swallowing as much air trying to keep up with the flow.3. She has to work for it more than she does with bottles with a faster flow, which is good because my wife is breastfeeding (I am the only one using the bottles, to let my wife get some sleep without having to wake her up to feed the baby every hour or so) and the bottles with a faster flow can make babies \"lazy\" and therefore lose interest in latching on to nurse.(Potential) cons:1. Feeding time takes significantly longer as a result of the slower flow. I don't really mind this because I am completely obsessed with our sweet little bundle of joy, but I can see it being inconvenient for late-night feedings, if you're in a rush, or if you have to mix medicine into your baby's breast milk/ formula and make sure they actually finish drinking it all.2. They were a bit more expensive than the ones we had on our registry, so if you don't have a specific reason for getting them like we did, it may not be worth the premium you're paying for themOverall this is a great product. I haven't had any problems with leaking or manufacturing defects like some of the other reviews mentioned. They make feeding time much less stressful because I no longer need to be so hyper-vigilant to keep her from choking, which is awesome when you're exhausted with a newborn.I don't leave reviews very often, but this product has most definitely earned one, for all the right reasons.10/10. Thank you, Philips, for making such an excellent product.",

                "reviewText": "We alternate between nursing and bottle feeding expressed breast milk. We have used BOTH the Dr Brown's and Phillips Avent bottles to keep baby adaptable. I prefer the Phillips Avent bottles. We have NOT had any issues with baby refusing to latch, refusing a bottle, or refusing a pacifier (also Phillips Avent brand).Baby is 5 months old at the time of this review. Baby eats 6 times a day - 5 bottles and 1 nursing session. 100% breastmilk. Mom went back to work at 8 weeks.SIZE and QUANTITYWe have 6 of the 4oz size and 6 of the 9oz size. 6 of each size was enough for us to maintain a rotation. I would recommend a minimum of 6 bottles.We used the 4oz size until baby was about 10 weeks old. After 10 weeks, we moved up to the 9oz. Can you skip the 4oz and just use the 9oz? Yes, but the measurements on the 9oz bottles are NOT as accurate as the measurements on the 4oz bottles when you're feeding smaller quantities in the beginning.CLEANINGWe use the Munchkin brand bottle brush and Papabolic sterilizer. The GRASS style drying racks do NOT work well with these bottles. I originally had one of the grass drying racks and ended up returning it. I purchased the drying rack that is specific to these Phillips Avent bottles instead and it works so much better.NIPPLE FLOWSWe have gone back and forth between the size 2 and size 3 nipples that were included with the 4oz and 9oz bottles. Baby had tongue, lip, and cheek ties in the beginning that were released at 5 weeks old. So we have gone back and forth between the nipple flows as baby's mouth was weak and then got stronger.I do NOT intend on buying additional nipple flows. Think about breastfeeding - does the flow of a human nipple change? NO! Baby's suction gets stronger. So why change the bottle nipple as baby grows? In my opinion, the various nipple flows are move of a marketing strategy rather than a necessity.PUMPINGThese bottles are compatible with Spectra. I pump directly into the 9oz bottles from Spectra flanges for my first pump of the day while I'm getting ready for work in the morning.I am highly satisfied with the quality of these Phillips Avent bottles. I would recommend these to any mom. I will continue to use these bottles for the duration of our bottle feeding experience.",
