        "description": "The b\u00f6kee makes late nights, early mornings, and round-the-clock moments a little bit easier for new parents with one-hand bottle prep enabling you to better hold and soothe your baby. Ideal for standard & wide mouth bottles such as comotomo, Nanobebe Flexy Evenflo, Dr. Brown\u2019s, Nuk and MAM. Made of food grade silicone, the b\u00f6kee is BPA-free, lead-free and phthalates-free and is top rack dishwasher safe. A smart solution that allows you to prep bottles and sippy cups with one hand. Keep breast milk from spilling when using the b\u00f6kee. It keeps silicone pumps and bottles with top-heavy flanges from tipping over, or you accidentally knocking it over! Compatible with Haaka, Medela, and Spectra pumps and bottles. Mix formula, open a medicine bottle or food jar, and prepare a sippy cup for your toddler with one-hand ease. Suction is key to using the b\u00f6kee correctly. Simply press down firmly on a hard, smooth and dry surface (just like anything that requires suction), nestle the bottle inside and apply gentle pressure while twisting. The b\u00f6kee's suction will hold your bottle in place so it can be opened, filled and closed with just one hand.",

                "reviewText": "The Bokee is pretty rad for new fathers! It lets you twist and open a bottle with ONLY 1 hand. That allows you to hold and dance with the babe in the other. Love this thing. I highly recommend it if you have smooth counter tops. If you have a bumpy or porous wooden counter top it works less well.Also it took a bit of trial and error to learn the maneuver to get the bottle out of the Bokee after tightened the cap. Watch some of their videos, that title action really helps!",
