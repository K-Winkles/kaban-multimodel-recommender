                "reviewText": "I wanted these to label my left overs. I figured they\u2019d work with mason jars (they do! See more below). I have peel off labels, but it kind of felt like a waste throwing them away so I was really excited when I saw these!I wish the instructions told me what kind of pen I could use that was erasable on it. I tried wet erase markers and they worked okay. They come off with water and don\u2019t leave a mark on the labels. They don\u2019t rub off after they dry if your hands are dry (if your hands are damp, it will smear and make a mess, though).It had to stretch a lot for a regular sized mason jar, and it made me nervous. I had one on there for three days and it didn\u2019t shatter, so maybe they are okay? They fit a lot better on half pint and smaller mason jars. I can use them without worrying :) It makes it easier how they are dishwasher safe and even safe in the micro and the freezer!I like these :) It makes me feel better that I\u2019m not just tossing labels in the garbage. I\u2019ll just have to remember to keep my damp hands off them\u2026and keep an eye on the reviews to see what pens other people found wipe off okay :)",

                "reviewText": "I got these so I can label the bottle times in our fridge, but they are actually too big for our 4 ounce bottles. It's obviously my fault for not paying closer attention, but I saw the skinny Dr. Bronner's bottle in the photo and assumed it was the small 4 ounce bottle instead of the larger 9 ounce bottles. Anyway, the labels themselves seem sturdy and well made and like they will hold up well over time. We do have a set of larger bottles, so I will just hold onto these until our baby girl is ready for those.",
