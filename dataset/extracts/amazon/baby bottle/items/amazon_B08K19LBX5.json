One bottle had a dent in it, the lids are so hard to screw on and if you don't get them absolutely perfect, they'll leak everywhere. I was about to send them back when I realized, the Dr Brown colic bottles, fit them perfectly. Now I have to use the Dr Brown lids but Dr Brown's lids fit the Disney bottles better then the Disney lids fit the Disney bottles. Sooo, just incase you use Dr Brown bottles, these go great with them. If you don't then it's not worth the money",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful baby bottles. I bought them for my 2 years old that\u2019s obsessed with Mickey, but they will open as soon as they fall. You can feel they don\u2019t close tight enough. I bought them on sale for a very cheap price, and figured out why they were so cheap. They are not cheaply made, is just that the lid and the bottle won\u2019t close safely enough.",
