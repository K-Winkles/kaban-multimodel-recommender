The entire process is faster than you think between the sterilizing and drying. This machine does offer several settings to accommodate your needs. We did get this on sale during the Black Friday special for $39 but even at full retail I still think it\u2019s worth every penny. We use the machine 2 to 3 times a day. I definitely recommend!",

Definitely one of the best postpartum purchases that has helped make life easier. I use it for Mam brand bottles, pacifiers, and all of my Momcozy brand breast pump parts. I usually have to use dryer mode twice for the breast pump parts just because a bit of moisture stays in the small ridges of some of the parts. It feels good knowing I'm able to take that extra measure to disinfect these items. I would highly recommend this for any mom!",

                "reviewText": "The Bottle Sterilizer and Dryer, Compact Electric Steam Baby Bottle Sterilizer, has become a reliable companion in my baby care routine. It functions well, effectively sterilizing and drying bottles with ease. The compact size is a great space-saver, but I do wish it had a larger capacity. It can only accommodate four Philips Avent bottles, while it would fit five bottles of Dr. Brown's. However, apart from this limitation, the sterilizer works perfectly. It is user-friendly, with easy controls and hassle-free cleaning. Overall, I recommend the Bottle Sterilizer and Dryer for its excellent performance and convenience, keeping in mind its limited capacity for certain bottle brands.",

It dries super quick and fits a decent amount in there. I run it several times a day and I literally would be lost without it.",

I used to sterilize in a pot on the stove \u2026.. I hate that I didn\u2019t buy this sooner with my first!! Can fit 4 large bottles and 4 nipples no problem in one sterilization. Super easy to use and clean. I love that I just put a little water in and close the lid - press a button and leave it. Come back 10 minutes later and the bottles are ready to go! So user and family friendly. If your thinking of buying a sterilizer DO IT!! This one works great - no issues and it\u2019s been 4 months of non stop use!",

It has an auto-off feature but no timer so to speak. I recommend not just leaving it over night. Reason being it will off it but the steam remains inside, so if you don't remove the cover, then it does not dry easily. It boils the water so the more water you have, the longer it will take to heat. Not a big deal to me, I just put more water to be on the safe side. There's water left after the auto timer is up. I only used it about 3 times now so I have not seen any scale built up but I do also drain the left over water soon after the auto timer is done. just be careful not to burn yourself.",
