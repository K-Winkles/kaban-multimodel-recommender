(We have used for 3 straight months now and they look new). I would recommend buying different dry erase markers as the one included works but dried out quickly for us.",

                "reviewText": "As soon as these labels arrived, I tested one to see if it held up to my expectation. The package came with an EXPO ultra fine tip dry erase marker.The writing is very clear on the label. I rubbed the label with cloth and my hand to see if the writing was removed and it was not. I wet the label and rubbed the writing with my hand. The writing smeared a little but was still legible. When I attempted to wash the writing away, it did come off but left a light \"ghost\" of the writing behind. It wasnt bad though, you could write over it easily and it did not effect the new info. If it is bothersome, i used a little bit of hand sanitizer to clean the label and it was as good as new.I got the SMALL blue labels. They fit my 4oz glass evenflo bottle. The evenflos are similar in size to dr. Brown. I have not used on my 4oz dr. Brown but i am confident that it will.",

They are easy to write on, and the ink from the marker that accompanied it is fairly durable. The ink washes off quite easily with a paper towel and water. The ink has held up so far in the bottle warmers at daycare.Con:The marker began to dry after a few weeks of use. I expected it to last longer.",

                "reviewText": "Really well made product. The pen that comes with it was dried out and not useful at all. Just chuck the pen regardless and use permanent or dry erase marker. The silicone labels were really well made. Initially, it will need some muscle to place the sleeve on the bottles, but it gets easier with use. Loved the orange color, it's muted and not too bright. Also, we were the only family that used this color so easy to keep baby's bottles separated. This fit most bottles from the ones that were wider to the slim ones. It kept the permanent marker writing on it for several months. Easy to wash in the dishwasher or hand wash. Now that we don't need it for milk bottles, I think it is perfect for sippy cups and snack cups during play dates, park visits, or anytime you have other kiddos in the mix.",
