I appreciate the thoughtful design with the window to see the oz/ml level.It's easier to get them on and off than the instructions would have you believe. I did not need soap to slip it on or off. I can do without anything or worse case a little water does the trick.I particularly appreciate the glow in the dark property of the blue swirl sleeve... for making bottles or using them in the middle of the night with the lights low or off, this is excellent. It is not much glow, very subtle, but just enough for me to see it and that's all I need.",

Attached is a video showing the easiest way I\u2019ve found to both put it on and take it off. Hoping it helps others as it took me a lot of trial and error to get it right.The key to getting it on is pushing down then pulling back up to push down again. The key to getting it off is to twist the bottle in the opposite direction from the sleeve as you pull apart.My daughter drops (throws) her bottle on our tile floor a LOT and these have saved countless bottles from shattering. Only once when she dropped it from her high chair did it actually break and this cover saved me from having to clean up any glass as it stayed within the silicone.These are easily hand washed in the sink.",

I've dropped two bottles onto tile, and both have survived thanks to these sleeves.I have every color, but I wish I would have just bought glow in the dark. It's the only one that has a fully transparent window where you can see how much milk you're adding. The other colors are almost fully opaque, which is frustrating when you're measuring formula for your screaming baby at 3am.",
