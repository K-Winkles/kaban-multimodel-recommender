I\u2019m a first time mom and at first we were using avent bottles and it was a nightmare. Baby was in so much pain from sucking in extra air during feedings. These bottles help baby pace feedings and filter out air. They do leak if your baby is trying to feed too fast because the extra air gets expelled through the top. They also will leak if you overfill the bottle. I always fill the water up first , leave a tiny bit of space under the line, and then put in the formula",

However, I switch to Glass due to her loving it even better if your baby does not like Glass would definitely recommend the plastic ones.

This is a great value, even if you don\u2019t need the premie nipples. These are also our favorite bottles because of the vent. They also have little inserts for when you are traveling with a bottle prefilled.",
