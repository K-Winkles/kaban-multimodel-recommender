This was an absolute game changer for my baby that didn\u2019t want to be put down. It allowed me to be hands-free while also enjoying the cuddles. The fabric is thick and durable. I washed it many times and it never lessened in quality. It was super comfortable for both myself and baby. It feels surprisingly supportive- I sometimes wore for hours and didn\u2019t feel sore or uncomfortable. Could easily sit up, stand, and change positions while wearing. While the shoulder part can be moved over to help support baby\u2019s head, I definitely used a hand to support whenever bending over as she could sometimes wiggle out. While it seemed confusing at first, it was easy to learn how to use the wrap. I just watched a quick tutorial online. Would definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Others say it\u2019s too cumbersome to use, but I promise\u2014 stay patient and keep working at it! I got the \u201ceasier\u201d D-Lite Kea babies wrap and tbh I prefer this original one. I use both, but this one is more comfortable for both me and baby in my personal opinion.When you\u2019re wrapping it, try bringing it around your body holding each piece by the edge of the cloth so you are minimizing twisting. This is what has made it easier for me to wrap. Just be patient, baby will quiet down as soon as you get her into the wrap! (:My 7 week old loves this thing, if she\u2019s fussy I verify fed+clean diaper+burped and once I get her into this wrap\u2014 she\u2019s out like a light! If I want to put her down, I lean over and wiggle her out, quickly lay her down and soothe her if she startles, and that\u2019s it folks\u2014 out for the count!During the day I keep her here almost the whole time she sleeps. I clean, cook, do my homework (I\u2019m a full time nursing student and right now taking online classes). I eat hot meals (gotta lean over to take bites but who cares?! It\u2019s a hot meal for mom during the tiny baby stage, it\u2019s a miracle!).My husband was skeptical at first but now he\u2019s a true believer in the baby wrap. He tries to imitate the wrap with his arms when he holds her while I\u2019m putting the wrap on; but he says it\u2019s never going to be like what he calls \u201cmommy\u2019s hug\u201d with the wrap \ud83d\ude02Anyway, I do highly suggest this. I like it a lot better than the ring sling I got, although I think I\u2019ll use that more often along with this one when she\u2019s older. It can get warm, but just adjust the temp. My girl likes it sometimes when I put the fan on us for a bit. She falls asleep even faster with the cool breeze and white noise of the fan, cuddled up tight inside the wrap against my chest. Enjoy!P.S. watch YouTube to see tutorials from the company!",

                "reviewText": "This wrap is super easy to use & comfortable. I have had 2 spinal fusions and my neck is prone to pinched nerves as well, so carrying my 9 month old great niece around in my arms put a lot of strain on my back & neck. This wrap helped distribute her weight appropriately, so I didn\u2019t feel any strain on those usually painful areas. I was able to wear her for hours without pain. Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This baby wrap is super soft, comfortable and breathable. It may spend few times to get used to wearing but once learned the way, it\u2019s very easy to wrap.One thing I found this baby wrap wins over a baby carrier like ergo baby was its material. The former is way more stretchy, comfortable and more friendly to newborn\u2019s skin. With a small bag, it\u2019s also easier to store and bring out.I began using this wrap since my baby was born and now his 6 month old I\u2019m still using it. I love how baby is close to me, sleeping safe and sound, while I can free both my hands. I definitely think it\u2019s a baby essential.",
