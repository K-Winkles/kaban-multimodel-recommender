PopYum is the only bottle which was designed to be used with one hand only so you can comfort baby or multitask with your other hand.",

It never touches the leak points of the tip of the nipple and anti-colic vent until you press the PopYum buttons which releases the agitator and allows the breast milk into the nipple area.",

We have taken this to Disneyland and it has made our trip more efficient. It's very easy to set up, just pour the water to your desired amount, put formula in the designated spot, input agitator, and secure the top. When ready for use, squeeze the sides and it is ready to go. I haven't had any leakage issues. The parts are dishwasher safe.I started using this when my little one was 6 months and the flow was fine for him. The width of the bottle may be too large for little ones to hold, especially for those younger than 6 months. My son had no problem holding the bottle, but each child is different and learns on their own. He transitioned from Dr.Brown bottles (narrow ones) to these bottles and it was fine for him at 6 months. I bought the biggest bottle due to how much formula he was consuming.What I don't like about the bottle is it doesn't really fit in the diaper bag bottle area. It also takes some time to dry.Before purchasing please consider:* baby's age (flow may be too fast)* baby's ability to hold the bottle on their own (bottle is wide)* the size of your diaper bag bottle areaOther than that, I would recommend other parents to give it a try!",

Just fill all the bottles with the formula in the dedicated slot and the correct amount of water it\u2019s all you need to worry about. When Baby gets to crying just click and shake and it\u2019s ready to go.

                "reviewText": "This bottle is a lifesaver. After the Mixie bottle gave out on us after 1.5 years I was in the market in search of another replacement and came across POPYUM. Compare to the Mixie Baby 2-Pack 8 oz. Bottles , here is a closer look at the pros and cons of this bottle.Pros -Aesthetic - this bottle looks modern and chic in echoing the price that you pay for. The orange color is a great choice for unisex and it's definitely a conversation starter when it is seen out in public.Travel Friendly - anything that can fit into my Diaper Backpack, Large Capacity Baby Bag, Multi-Function Travel Backpack Nappy Bags, Nursing Bag, Fashion Mummy, Roomy Waterproof for Baby Care, Stylish and Durable by Jewelvwatchro (Navy blue) is a huge plus, and this fits into the cooler compartment beautifully with ease.Leakage begone - there is no leakage in the gear compartment. Everything fits and screw tightly and beautifully together.Assembly - I love putting together this bottle. The flange that comes with the set is so adorable and there is 0 mess whatsoever in the aftermath.Weight - This bottle is super lightweight overall even with the top-heavy design. My baby can hold and drink this on her own with no issue.A Few Minor Cons -Size - this bottle is definitely on the bulkier's end with a top-heavy design. There were a few occasions where I set a newly made bottle down too hard and the agitator would become disengage, causing the powder to release.Mixing - due to the nature of the storage design, the powder will become attach inside the nipple the longer it is sitting inside the bottle pre-mixed. I usually prepare the bottle around 9 pm for a 12 am feeding, and I would notice that I would have to shake the bottle for a nanosecond longer than I normally would have to with a regular bottle like the Avent Classic Feeding Bottle 260ml (3) , otherwise the powder will stay clog at the nipple tip, causing the milk unable to fully flow through.Flow - this is more of a review for the PopYum Stage 3 Fast Flow Nipples, 2-Pack , but even with the fast flow nipple, this is still a relatively slow flow compare the fast flow from other brands such as the Comotomo Silicone Replacement Nipple, Fast Flow, 6+ Months, 2 Count that we have. My 15 months take the Comotomo fast flow with no problem but with the PopYum, she would have to pull out to release pressure every 10 sec or so in order to continue the milk flow. Otherwise, the nipple would collapse.Cleaning - as most reviewers have mentioned, the top compartment does take a bit longer to dry. I normally would leave this inside the Baby Brezza Baby Bottle Sterilizer and Dryer Machine \u2013 Electric Steam Sterilization - Universal Fit - Pacifiers, Glass, Plastic, and Newborn Feeding Bottles for 60 mins and it comes out perfectly dry ready for assembly. Washing and drying with a towel to be used right away will not be a good idea, as it is nearly impossible to get all the moisture out.Printing - a hard scrub will rub off the printing, so please do wash mildly and gently with care. I made this mistake the first time washing but it has been fine ever since.A thought on this bottle vs the competitor -A lighter weight bottle, extremely easy assemply, great modern and improved ergonomic design makes this bottle ultra unique and clever. The patent design was cleverly done and very innovative, I wish I had found this sooner years ago. The only minor downside to this is dropping the bottle too hard will cause the agitator to disengage. However, compared to the poor assembly design that comes with the Mixie, I can tackle this minor flaw. Another key point that's worth mentioning is the exceptional customer service that's behind this brand. I've recently lost the agitator during washing and I've reached out to customer service for assistance - not only was the responses were prompt, but I was treated with great care and with the utmost attention. This is truly a great up and coming product and what's more important is your purchase will reward you with a great customer appreciation should you ever have any questions or concern.",
