I have mine by our kitchen sink, it\u2019s easy accessible and keeps everything for preparing a bottle at hand. The ridges on the mat help with drainage and quick drying. The colorful ridges add a pop of cute colors. The pegs can be removed or put on either side of the mat, it stays in place on the mat well. There\u2019s a small indent in the silicone mat to push the pegs into to hold them in place. There are two openings to hold bottle brushes and a cup in the middle to help hold a bottle upright for preparation. It can easily be hand washed or thrown in the dishwasher.

                "reviewText": "When my son was little we used Dr Brown\u2019s products and appreciated their quality. More recently, our family has been more focused on recycling. In order to recycle, most items need to be rinsed out and air dried. While it is easy to rinse things, finding a way to get empty water/pop/juice bottles to remain standing while turned upside down to drain and dry is not. I kept remembering the baby bottle drain/dry stations I had seen back in the day when our son was much younger and thought that might work well. That is when I came across this bottle drying/prep mat from Dr Brown\u2019s. The pegs originally designed to hold baby bottles while draining also work equally well for bottles draining and drying out for recycling. The center cavity will be nicely repurposed for bottle lids, and the rest of the mat will allow for draining/drying of other to-be-recycled containers. The entire items is well made from a heavier weight silicon, and will wash up easily in the dishwasher. Recommend - for multiple purposes!",

                "reviewText": "We use Dr Brown's bottles for my grandson, so when I saw this item I wanted to give it a try. The mat itself is heavier than I expected - definitely sturdy silicone. I like that the brush holder feature is removable and that all parts are dishwasher safe. The green inserts (that go in the bottle) as well as the bottle fit great on the pegs. My one complaint is that I don't think the middle part which is supposed to hold the bottle for you for one-handed preparation is that great. The bottle fits into it, but doesn't sit flat on the bottom, so it tilts a bit. I also don't love the rainbow color - would have preferred something in neutral tones for my kitchen. But, overall I am happy with the product and think it is well made.",

The blue \u201cgrass\u201d portion is removable and you can toss the whole thing into the dishwasher which is nice and convenient when you want to thoroughly clean it. You can\u2019t fit as much on it, just a few bottles on the rainbow portion, some pacifiers or bottle nipples on the grass and some toddler utensils in the middle. I do wish it would have drainage though because you do have to empty the water more often than you\u2019d think since it\u2019s just a silicone tray essentially. I appreciate that it\u2019s not such bright coloring so it can match your space.",

                "reviewText": "This drying rack is quite different in its design, with the built-in bottle spot and removable insert. It's a lot sturdier than I thought it would be, doesn't flex and act wobbly when you pick it up, it's got substance. The ridges are pronounced enough to work very well and everything is easily cleaned. It doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter but was still slightly bigger than I thought it would be.",
