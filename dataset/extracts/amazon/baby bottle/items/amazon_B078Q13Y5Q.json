But then I found these and figured I\u2019d give them a shot because they were low priced and I was tired of spending a ton of money on brands that didn\u2019t work. Best bottle we\u2019ve tried. They don\u2019t \u201clook fancy\u201d, but we haven\u2019t had a leak, they\u2019re easy, simple, and the nipples they have are perfect for preventing any gas/colic without all those extra pieces. So easy to clean.The ONLY problem I have is that it\u2019s pretty hard to see the measurement of ounces on the side of the bottles... especially in the dark. If you have poor vision they probably won\u2019t work out well for you.Pros outweighed the (one) con for us. We even ordered more because I don\u2019t see us needing to, or wanting to try another brand.",

I have one of the old school standard neck playtex ventaire bottles before they discontinued and it\u2019s the only bottle that my daughter doesn\u2019t make a complete mess with. I searched for months for something similar. Trying out so many different bottles wasting so much money. She hates the dr browns nipples but so many bottles have that same type of nipple including the eventflo classic. Then there\u2019s all the fancy ones that also worked terrible for her. then I found these by total accident and the nipples are almost identical to the old ventaire bottles and OMG she does so good on them. I\u2019m so happy. They\u2019re easy to clean too. No so many sorts that other venting bottles have. The markings like others have said are a tad hard to see but only if you\u2019re not in a well lit area but they\u2019re not as terrible as people have said. Wish I found these sooner because they\u2019re affordable too. I would\u2019ve saved myself a lot of headache and money. I was bummed at first though that they come with the slow flow nipples since normally when you purchase an 8 oz bottle they come with the medium. However since the way they\u2019re vented they flow like a medium flow nipple. So definitely keep that in mind when purchasing.",

                "reviewText": "Our sweet boy (2 months old now) has tried Dr. Brown, Avent, and NUK bottles, but these are his favorites by far!!!! He is able to make a great \"suction\" around the nipples and they're easier for him, especially because he started out with feeding issues and wasn't gaining weight very fast. I was debating about getting the glass bottles, but I was glad I just got them in this material because they are so light- weight, easy to grip and they are better suited for when baby begins to hold his own bottle. I had to order the next stage nipples directly from the Evenflo Feeding Store. So, I definitely wish they were more accessible for shoppers; I can only find them on Amazon or Walmart (online).",

They feel so cheap, don\u2019t screw on right all the time and tend to pop off if you\u2019re not careful. Yes the dr brown bottles are a hassle to clean but if you get the Options version they are a lot better quality and you won\u2019t ever have to deal with a cheap collar ring,",
