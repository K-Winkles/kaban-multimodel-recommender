        "description": "The NUK Smooth Flow\u2122 Pro Anti-Colic Baby Bottle features an anti-colic venting system proven to reduce baby colic symptoms of gas, extensive crying, and reflux. The advanced venting system minimizes air bubbles in the milk so baby swallows less air, reducing spit-up and burping. The NUK Smooth Flow\u2122 Pro Anti-Colic Bottle has fewer pieces than the leading anti-colic bottle*, so it's easier to prep, assemble, and clean. And because the nipple and collar is only one piece, there are no leaks, guaranteed. SafeTemp\u2122 technology features a blue thermometer indicator that fades when milk is too hot and reappears when milk has cooled and is safe to drink. The newborn bottle's unique nipple design allows baby to control the flow of milk with their suction strength, delivering comfortable, colic-free feeding. Our Anti-Colic Baby Bottle is BPA-free and dishwasher-safe. *based on NPD Unit Sales L52 2021",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are very nice and the baby loves them but when they have the straw in them and the temperature changes, like putting cold milk/room temperature milk in a bowl of warm water or a bottle warmer they begin leaking almost immediately.When putting fresh breastmilk in them and than in the fridge they also begin leaking.They are nice bottles but basically you can\u2019t warm the milk them without taking the lid off and than you can\u2019t use a warmer. They aren\u2019t as prone to leaking without the straw but still can.Easy to clean, temperature strip is nice. I won\u2019t be buying more though due to the leaking problem.",
