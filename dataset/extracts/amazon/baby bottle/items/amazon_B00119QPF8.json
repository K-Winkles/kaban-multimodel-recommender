Very little clean up really it might seem crazy to have to buy liners to some but I think a colic bottle with 17000 different parts or having to constantly sterilize all these different bottle. Super easy on the go!! And you buy them in month supplies very accurate!",

                "reviewText": "I've never had a problem with these.I did accidentally pop a hole in one BUT the instructions CLEARLY warns against using sharp objects to push liners and I CLEARLY ignored the warning. That was my fault 100% that being said.The liners eliminate a few steps in bottle preparation.Dont have to wash the bottle as often. The liners are sterilized and always clean if u take care of them. It's not difficult to close the box.Makes warming the milk faster because the [barrier] between hot water and milk is so thin, it allows for fast warming.Dont let the thinnest of the bag worry youm they dont break super easily while using them properly.Not sure the best way to travel with these? I put a few in a ziplock baggie and they dont take up much space so I guess maybe not so bad for traveling. Maybe actually best for traveling. Rather than having multiple bottles you have to wash. Just one bottle and 2-4 nipples. 100 liners takes the space of 2 or 3 bottles. You don't usually need 100. You need less than 10/ day in this size. The 4oz ones even take less space. So in the end the liners are a win in my book!",
