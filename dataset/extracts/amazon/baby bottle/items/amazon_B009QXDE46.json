                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic bottle, with one small heads-up...",
                "reviewText": "After trying several different brands and types of baby bottles, this one is the winner by a long shot. In summary, they have the magic combination of being both vented AND easy to clean. Let me explain...Due to some challenges with nursing we have been feeding our little one exclusively from bottles (with pumped breast milk), so we have had plenty of opportunity to try different bottles! The first bottles we used were non-venting, which turned out to be a big mistake. By the time our little one was a few weeks old she had developed such a strong suck that she would create a vacuum inside inside the bottle as she drank, which would cause the nipple slowly to collapse. Several times each feeding we would have to pull the nipple gently to one side of her mouth to break the seal and allow the nipple to re-expand. Obviously these mid-feed interruptions did not make her happy!Next we tried a well-known brand of vented bottles which vent via a thin tube that extends all the way down through the center of the bottle. Although these bottles solved the suction problem, each one had four separate pieces, two of which contained tiny internal tubes. Cleaning all these small parts was cumbersome to say the least, and the thought of doing it multiple times per day filled me with a sense of despair I just couldn\u2019t shake. There had to be a vented bottle that wasn\u2019t so difficult to clean!Enter the Comotomo bottle (accompanied by rays of sunshine and a renewed sense of hope). This was the answer! What makes this bottle so great?1. The bottle is vented very simply, via two tiny \u201cvalves\u201d on the sides of the nipple, so the whole bottle has just THREE pieces: the bottle itself, a nipple, and a plastic ring which secures the nipple to the bottle. No small parts to get lost!2. The wide-mouth design and lack of tiny tubes make these VERY easy to clean.3. The lightly textured silicone body has a non-slip quality which makes the bottle easy to grip.4. They don\u2019t leak (at least, WE have never had a problem with them leaking)5. They have a cool, modern design (this is subjective and a matter of opinion, but still\u2026).I can really only find one \u201cnegative\u201d to these bottles, and it\u2019s really not so much a fault but rather a characteristic due to their shape. As the bottle\u2019s contents are being consumed, if the bottle is held at a 45-degree angle or so, the last bit of liquid will pool at the top-side of the bottle instead of flowing into the nipple (see my photo). This isn\u2019t a big deal, as all you have to do is tilt the bottle more upright briefly and the liquid will move into the nipple, but it is something to watch as the bottle gets close to empty.Oh, and it\u2019s not obvious from the product photos, but these bottles DO have volume markings on them. They are inconspicuous but still easy to read.We are VERY happy with these bottles.",

                "reviewText": "Baby Review + Comparison to other bottles/nipples as well as explanation on complain on leaks.Baby Background: Full term baby. Had trouble latching for much of the first month. Had to find a bottle that did not interfere with learning to nurse. Bottle use for pumped milk and occasional formula. No issues.Overall.Pros: Worked better with Baby trying to Latch. Easy to clean. Soft and comfortable. At 1-2.5 months i could balance the bottle with the chin or between chin and should for hands free feeding.Cons: Round so it tips and rolls away easily. Whoops. But its soft, so no worries. Just gotta rinse the tip and there you go again (at home). If you don't check the nipple installation it may leak and if it leaks, it will run a small river down your baby and your arm. Check for leaks. (tips below)*** Comparison to other bottles we triedMy baby didn't deal with colic. Started with Dr Browns and Comotomos. He loved the Dr. Browns but it flowed too quick and he regressed in his breastfeeding. He choked on the Philips Avents, too fast. And the medela Calmas were too long and he choked on those too. If you have free samples or hand me downs, it could also be he got used to the comotomos, so the others seemed fast.***Transition to Medium flow at 3.5 monthsBaby just upgraded to Comotomo Medium flow at 3.5 months. Noticed, when he started to stop having boughts of chugging and seemed to ALWAYS be distracted during feedings (every feeding). We had tried the medium flow at 3 months and he choked a few times. But then he started needing more breaks when eating with the slowflow and the medium flow allowed him to eat at the pace he wanted.***Why it can leak --- User Error rather than Design ErrorCan leak if not properly attached. Bottle set up comes in 3 pieces (4 including cap). Rubber nipple, nipple holder and bottle. You stick the nipple into the nipple holder, Can be done with one hand but if it doesn't load completely in, it will leak. Its pretty obvious if you check but as any newborn parent is a bit too tired, you'll catch yourself with a leaky bottle every once in a while.Quick was to check. Pop in nipple. Screw on top. It should be a semi-sealed when you screw it on, aside from the vents. If you poke the top, you should feel resistance as a little air comes out the vents. If you hear or feel air come out easily through the sides, that means you didn't seal it right and it will leak. User error, not design error. People who complain about leaks never learned to properly attach the nipple or got a rare defective product.",

                "reviewText": "Generally I think these bottles are very good. They're highly ranked everywhere for a reason. The soft sides are unique and if the bottle happens to fall there won't be a huge clatter that will wake the baby. I think a lot of babies latch well to these, mine included. Also, I've never had one of these leak on me, which is rare.A few things, though. As others mentioned, these bottles are very wide and won't fit in the side pockets of most diaper bags. That seems a little trivial but actually is pretty annoying. Also, I feel like there's more milk left in these than, for example, Dr. Brown's, again owing to how wide the bottle is--it's a little hard to get the right angle for that last bit of milk, which means a little might get left over, which makes my diligently pumping wife very angry at me. As others have noted, the hash marks are inferior and hard to pick up in dim light. Finally, it has those little vents, but my baby isn't any less gassy with these versus others--the Dr. Brown anti-colic bottles are the only ones that seem effective at that. (Also, just for the record, these are WAY easier to clean than Dr. Brown bottles.)If you're new to this game, you're probably going to want to try a bunch of different bottles to see what works for your baby. And PS, what works for your baby now may be different than what works for your baby in a couple months, so don't just toss what doesn't work at first!",

                "reviewText": "Good for our slow flow requirement from the nipple, as it was recommended for our newborn so that the formula doesn't just spill into her mouth uncontrollably, much less spit-ups. Also, Easy to clean. Our newborn who had trouble latching started using it at 1 month old and didn't have any problems drinking from it.Issues:1.The base of the bottle very tippy which caused lots of spilled formula and pumped breast milk when we prepare a bottle and the lid isn't yet closed.2. Doesn't heat well so we only serve the formula in it, but heat the liquid in a simple medela plastic bottle in the microwave.3. Need to hold it very high for the last few milliliters of pumped breast milk since the milk gets stuck in the sides of the nipple.4. Cap and lid are both difficult to put on, mostly at first couple of days when you're not used to or, so don't do it in a hurry.",
