            "PREMIUM VENTING - Evenflo Feeding's patented Proflo Venting Technology was developed to ensure milk bubbles stay in the bottle and not in your baby's tummy. This gentle, 1-piece venting system helps significantly reduce the potential for colic, reflux, gas, and fussiness, keeping your baby comfortable even after they are finished eating.",
            "EASY TO CLEAN - Designed with only 3 pieces, the Vented Plus Glass Baby Bottles can be easily assembled and disassembled for a quick, thorough cleaning between feedings. And because there are only a few parts, there is nothing extra to worry about misplacing. These bottles are also dishwasher safe (top rack only), making your busy life a little easier.",

        "description": "The Evenflo Feeding Vented + Glass Bottle delivers a twist on an iconic, classic design. This glass bottle is recyclable, sustainable, and Mother Nature approved. The unique, ergonomic shape is easy-to-hold, making feeding time comfortable for both you and your baby. The included Vented + Slow Flow Nipples are 100% silicone and feature built in air vents to help prevent nipple collapse. The nipple has a gradual transition between nipple length and base to allow your baby to maintain their latch. The Vented + Glass Bottles have molded measurement markers in both ounces and milliliters to provide an easy and accurate way to measure the volume of liquid. These dishwasher-safe bottles (top rack only) are compatible with all Evenflo Feeding breast pumps, as well as most other standard neck breast pump brands. The bottles and nipples are 100% free of BPA, polycarbonates, PVC and phthalates, and are also made of food-grade material.",

Easy to wash and sanitize. It comes with the slow flowing nipples but I was able to buy fast flow nipples as well for my toddler to use for his nightly chocolate milk. The textures on the outside of the bottle also make it easy for a toddler to grip and not let it slip. Absolutely amazing bottles!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using these for 12 months now and they are fantastic. They don\u2019t leak, they are dishwasher safe, not too heavy for my baby to use to feed herself. They\u2019re solid and can withstand dropping onto my hardwood floors. They fit the connectors on my Medela pump and so I can pump directly into them. I usually fill them up with 5oz at a time. The price of the bigger bottles was cheaper than the pride of the smaller bottles so I went with these ones even though I don\u2019t give such big bottles to my baby. The nipple flow that these came with has worked for my baby since birth and she continues to use the same nipples. With other brands in the past I have switched from slow flow to medium then fast flow but these ones seem to be ok just the way they are. Once we\u2019re done with bottles, I\u2019m planning on passing along to a friend because glass lasts! If no one wants them, I might use them as vases because they are cute in teal color and have happy memories for me.",

                "reviewText": "We always use glass bottles for our kids. Baby #5 is 2 months old now. We've used Dr. Brown's glass for the most part, but decided to give these a try. I wish I used these from the start. The vent actually works amazing. No issues with the nipple collapsing. I was concerned about breaking them so I ordered a pack of white claw koozies for the tall bottles and red bull koozies for the short bottles. They insulate and protect from breakage and are cheap! I will likely buy another set before all is said and done. Very happy with these. They could make the numbers on the side easier to read, but that's the only con I can think of.",
