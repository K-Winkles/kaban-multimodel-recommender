                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works decently, but my baby prefers no handles",
                "reviewText": "My 8 mo old has been working on feeding themselves with a bottle for a few months now and can often get through a whole bottle without much help (I just need to hand it back if it gets dropped). I thought these handles might make it even easier especially with the claim they could be sterilized and go in the dishwasher with everything else.I've shared five different bottles with the same ring and nipple and the handles attached to each. Then I'm one picture I've shown all five bottles. All five fit the handles, but the three on the left allow the handles to spin and the two on the right do not. I believe the ones without logos are spectra and motif but I'm not sure which is which. I haven't noticed the spinning being an issue though so that's a plus.Whether it spins or not depends on how tightly the ring you have fits the bottle you're putting it on, as the handle simply sits below the bottom of the ring. I was worried when I ordered these that they might cause a leak if they stopped the ring from fully tightening, but that hasn't been an issue with any bottle I've tried. I've included one picture that shows the area of the handles where it sits in the bottle.The handles stick out from the bottles quite a bit which might make them easier to grab but at least for my baby it feels a bit too spread out. They're also sort of a spoon shape which doesn't seem very useful for my baby. I think something more like a cylinder would be an easier shape to grab.In the end, I probably won't keep using these as my baby has progressed significantly in their ability to hold their bottle without handles and I think this would just be another additional skill to learn, but I know for months I was thinking \"what if there were handles for bottles like sippy cups have?\" so I could see these handles being useful if we had them earlier on - say at 4 or 5 months old when they started feeding themselves, or potentially even at 2 months when they started working on holding the bottle.I don't know anything about the company so it's hard to trust the claims of no BPAs and all the rest without any additional evidence, so for that and the weird handle shape I'm giving 4 stars. Still potentially useful, but not a fit for our particular needs.",

We tried out a handle and she immediately held on and fed herself happily (with our supervision). These are great for strong-willed, independent babies like ours who like to be in control of their own destiny (and their own feedings).",

                "reviewText": "These handle attachments fit on our plastic Avent baby bottles. One puts a handle attachment on the bottle before screwing the nipple portion of the bottle onto the bottle itself. The handles are a good size for a baby to hold. The handle attachment doesn't \"lock\" into place. Rather, it rotates fairly freely around the bottle, but this is not a problem. When the baby is drinking, the baby holds the bottle in place by virtue of sucking on the \"nipple\", and holds the handle attachment in place by, of course, holding the handles. So, ultimately these handle attachments work very well. No need to be put off by the fact that the handle attachment can rotate a bit when the baby is not using the handles to drink from the bottle.",
