I say that because some of the sippy cup styles have caps that flap open or shut and get in the way when she\u2019s drinking or they\u2019re so wide it covers her eyes while she drinks. I have purchased 3 of these: one 5 oz and two of these! They\u2019re awesome. They are easy to take a part and clean and the depictions are super cute to choose from. They\u2019re good quality, they don\u2019t leak and they feel intact.",

                "reviewText": "These sippy\u2019s are a great transition from bottle to sippy cup. The handle can be used or left off. My toddler loves to carry hers around. While teething they tend to gnaw on the nipple and bite larger holes in the top. If this happens the cup will leak, otherwise they stay pretty leakproof. This is our second time purchasing these sippys. We buy the replacement nipples. When we notice they start dripping, we throw out the old nipples and use a replacement. It\u2019s like we have a brand new bottle again! A great buy!",

We also have the star bottles (which are also great!) but our toddler loves the mickey mouse ones so much she only wants to drink from these. I will note that the bottle has to be properly put together to be leak proof. If there is a discrepancy anywhere, no matter how small, milk will dribble out. Otherwise, I'd totally recommend!",
