I tried to take out the nipple and put it back in, I make sure the lid was ok tight and it was really bad with 2 of the 3 bottles. 1 bottle worked fine and didn\u2019t see as many bubbles while she was drinking her milk but the other 2 were so bad.",

                "reviewText": "There are 3 Avima anti-colic bottles in this order. They are good bottles. I ordered them for 6 months old, but the nipple is quite big for medium flow. I think it will take a while to adjust the flow with it. Nevertheless, this bottle works fine and the cute elephant pattern is just right for kids. Great value on these anti-colic bottles!!",

They allow too much air when baby is drinking and offered no help for colic. As I said they might work out ok for older babies and maybe as a back up bottle to be kept in a diaper bag but I would not recommend for every day use.",
