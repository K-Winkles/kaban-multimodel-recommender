                "reviewText": "I was a little worried seeing the reviews about low flow, and I can understand for a younger kid it might be slightly difficult, but for things like juice that you don't want them to chug, it's perfect.I bought these to encourage myself to drink more water, and it works. I drank 2 bottles full in like 30min, when normally I wouldn't drink any all day.I have autism, and normally use stim chews to help with anxiety and bad habits of biting nails, and chewing on these has worked great as well.I was even able to put soda in them, and because of the vent hole, it didn't even leak. I was extremely impressed.Only flaw is that it is slightly low flow, but it's good if you have a kid who tends to drink too fast. It's not hard to drink from, just alot slower then sipping from a hard sippy or cup.They are super easy to clean, all the pieces come apart once unscrewed. They are also very pretty, love the design in person.The strap clips can also be removed, and had no issues with leaking when taken off.All in all, for a kid or for an adult these bottles are definitely worth the money.",

We\u2019ve tried other transition sippies/nipples before and it did NOT go well. She wasn\u2019t happy about it the first night but here we are on night two and she happily took the cup! I love that it\u2019s a 10oz cup while others are like 5-8. Super simple parts. Easy to clean. Aesthetically pleasing. If my baby likes it and it helps achieve our goal, then I like it!",
