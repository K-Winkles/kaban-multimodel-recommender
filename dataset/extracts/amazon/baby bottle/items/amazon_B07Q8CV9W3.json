                "reviewText": "Or that's what I'm calling them.My three-month-old daughter has tracheomalacia. Which is a disorder of her trachea. It causes her to choke extremely easily on the slowest flow nipples. Along with colic and severe reflux. She paced feeds, so bottle shape plays a massive role. She's also breastfed, so nipple shape is just as important.We went through every single top of the line bottle you can imagine. Just like with my son. Nothing worked. She would scream, fight, and push every bottle away. The worse she choked, the more she averted the bottle.At the end of my rope, we decided to give another kit a try.We'd heard about these bottles, but I was afraid it was just another gimmicky style with the same problems. Boy ... was I wrong.She INSTANTLY latched. There was no fight. No wiggling. No holding it at a certain angle. She just took it. The nipple is definitely close to breast.My next worry was choking and flow. She still chokes some on the slowest flow, but nothing like she did with the other bottles. The severity and frequency of the episodes dropped dramatically. To the point where instead of refusing the bottles of fighting us, she takes right to it. The decent flow rate allows her to go more than her usual 5 suck and break pattern! NO other bottles have accomplished this for us.GREAT colic and gas relief. Which genuinely surprised me seeing as there is no long additional vent. Which means no 5000 parts to clean and lose! I feared that without the vent, that it surely meant we'd have gas. There's no way we'd get lucky enough to find a bottle that she loved, didn't choke her badly, AND didn't give her gas.Wrong again.This bottle is a flippin' miracle.Coupled with it's comfortable ergonomic shape and soft, touchable texture for baby - it's unbeatable.Get them!",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve been using the Comotomo with our (now) ~2.5 month old son. The good part is that the flow rate and venting have worked great. He is also able to move back and forth between the breast and bottle near seamlessly. Cleaning the bottle is also an absolute cinch, and generally speaking the build quality is good.Now, the not so good parts are that:a) For some god forsaken reason, the manufacturer has decided to put form over function when it comes to the measurement marking on the bottle. Since it isn\u2019t colored in any way and blends in 100% to the rest of the bottle body, PM/late night feeds REQUIRE you to have a source of light nearby to see how much you\u2019ve poured in/baby has fed. This is a major oversight IMHO making late feeds inconvenientb) Those same measurements\u2026.they\u2019re off roughly by ~10ml. We supplement with ready-to-feed formula, once in a while. It is a 200ml bottle and when I put in a Comotomo claimed 100ml of formula the first feed, I consistently have a Comotomo claimed 120ml the next time\u2026which means the Comotomo is overestimating by ~10mlc) The cap\u2026the wretched cap! Why does it need to be so damn tight?! When you have a wailing baby in one hand and you\u2019re desperately trying to pop open the cap with your other hand and it won\u2019t budge without crazy force. Fail.I would\u2019ve given this fewer starts, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the actual feeding has been going well with our baby.",

I know bottles turn yellow over time but this is has been such a short time frame, its very disappointing.They were cute while it lasted but we most likely wont be buying again.",
