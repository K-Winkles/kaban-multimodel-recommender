                "reviewText": "Highly recommended for exclusive breastfeeding babies who refuse bottles. It took us a few months of feeding in the carseat in the car (on and off) before he got the hang of it and weaned himself from the breastmilk and transitioned 100% to the bottle! We now hold the baby facing forward when feeding our son to mimic the sitting position in the car seat.Pros:-Accepted by exclusive breastfeeding babies!!-Soft, short nipples that is easier to suck on and won't gag (The nipple on Dr. Brown both narrow and wide neck bottles which were too long and made my son gag at month 4... he was ok with the bottle when he was a newborn. The nipple on the Phillip Avent wide neck bottles were too stiff). We also tried Num and Mimijumi, which didn't work out either)-The flow of milk on the bottle is great, it doesn't gush out when tipping over the bottle like some of the other fast flow nipples (Phillip Avent), so baby will not choke on the milk when the flow is too fast for them. And baby can learn to control the flow of the milk.-Air vent of the bottle allows the baby to drink the milk continuously and that he doesn't have to stop for air.-Soft squeezable bottle which was important when trying to get baby to learn how to use the bottle. I could squeeze a little milk into his mouth so he could taste it, then squeeze more into his mouth when he was learning how to drink from the bottle (apparently drinking from the breasts and the bottle is completely different). WIth some of the bottle, either the milk gushed out when i tried to dab my son's lips with some milk, or milk wouldn't come out because there was no way to squeeze the bottle, and due to the air vent, milk wouldn't come out unless the baby sucks on it)-Few parts, super easy to wash (only 3 parts vs. Dr. Brown which had way too many hard to wash parts). Dr. Brown was great when my son was a newborn and had gas issues.Cons:-For some reason, the silicon bottle absorbs detergent smell when using dishwasher even though it's supposedly dishwasher safe. I contacted customer service through amazon, the service was great and they offered refund/replacement right away.-The bottle of the bottle is round and narrow, so the bottle often rolls off the table if you accidentally bumped the table or the bottle.Other:- The bottle was leaking for the longest time, until I double checked the instructions and made sure that the nipple was placed into the rim correctly. It stopped the leaking, and my son was able to drink from the bottle successfully.Giving it 5 stars because my son eventually loved it (after 5 months)!",

                "reviewText": "Comotomo baby bottles are a game-changer for parents seeking a convenient and practical solution for feeding their infants. The bottle has a soft, squeezable body, which closely resembles the feel of a mother's breast. This unique design allows babies to latch on easily and promotes a smooth transition between breast and bottle. I particularly appreciate the ease of use and maintenance that comes with Comotomo bottles. The wide opening facilitates effortless filling and cleaning, and the overall construction ensures durability. The bottles are microwave and dishwasher safe, providing added convenience.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this is hands-down my favorite purchase for my formula-fed son! 10/10! He was a VERY gassy baby before the bottle purchase, who was also already on sensitive formula prior to treat his gas.Here are a few of the most common complaints I read about the bottles prior to our purchase:Tip over easily/ top heavy; egg shape is poor design; hard to open and close; leaking; air valves sticking shut; difficult to read measurements... despite these complaints we decided to try them and here is our thoughts!!The reviews stating that the egg-shaped design is simply for aesthetic appeal and not practical are simply missing the big picture! The tapered design is necessary for accurate ounce measurements while accounting for the shape of the large nippletop! Sure a cylinder shaped bottle may not weeble wobble but if you don't mind taking an extra 0.3 seconds to set the bottle down up right you will have no problems at all!The soft squishy bottle reviewers are stating is very difficult to open and close, I myself have had no problems... I simply cup my hand around the solid rim of the top of the silicone bottle while opening and closing.That's squishy design is very clever in my opinion! It is designed to replicate a mother's breast along with the large, wide nipple top. This makes for a much easier transition for a breastfed baby to a bottle because the silicone is squishy and feels like a mother's full breast well the nipple is wider and larger like a real breast and they don't have to change their latching technique. My son was never breastfed and he has had no problems transitioning from a normal typical bottle top to the larger wider nipple... If anything, it has helped enormously because he naturally and instinctually opens wider for a breast, and when he nursed a normal bottle you would hear suckling sounds from the corners of his mouth while latching... Which ultimately was just additional air intake for my already gassy baby!!The valves on the nipple are what caught my attention the most. They're designed to let air in the bottle so that there is a consistent flow of milk without the disruption of collapsing a bottle we're pulling the bottle away to relieve the suction. For us, the valves worked as advertised! We have had no issues with the valves being stuck closed with clumps of milk or sticking together.. perhaps this is because we are using formula? Or maybe thoroughly cleaning or bottles and valves? I am unsure because we have had no issues whatsoever!!!Also, we have had no issues whatsoever with leaking. There was one user error where I did not insert the nipple in the collar straight which resulted in minor leaking but I open the bottle, closed it again, and everything was fine. We have had no leaks from the valves... Maybe this is caused by people inserting a cleaning brush into them and they are becoming misshapened?? Perhaps just a faulty nipple??The other biggest complaint I read which concerning the ounce measurements on the side of the bottle. Some reviewers stated they were difficult to read and or did not like the fact that there was only measurements on one side of the bottle. All of the other bottles I have used, including common types like Medela, have all had only one measurement bar on the entire bottle. To me this is not a huge deal because you just turn the bottle and it's right there!! I can understand how measurements could be difficult to see, since the bottle of silicone and not plastic, the measurements are molded into the side of the silicone bottle rather than printed measurements like the Medela bottles. this is also not been a big deal to me because let's remember mommies and daddies out there, this bottle is designed to help our babies eat better, more comfortably, without gas and colic! So ultimately I do not mind looking at the bottle, placing my thumb near the ounce mark I'm wanting to use ( which I also made a habit of doing on my bottles that were plastic and printed) in order to use it as a filling guide for milk or water levels..hopefully this helps some of you out there debating whether or not to make the investment. The price is significantly more expensive then a typical bottle but for our situation it was worth every penny because our baby is so much more comfortable and we were able to see a difference in our sons gassiness immediately!!!My opinion: take the plunge and invest! I will do my best to make time and record/ upload a video review!",

With other bottles she would almost choke and spit up/burp a lot but with this one, she controls how fast the milk and formula go which means I hardly have any wasted and the child isn\u2019t choking. Yes she feeds longer due to being able to control how much she gets but I am ok with that.Also, no issues switching between breast and bottle at all!Would recommend for all moms.",
