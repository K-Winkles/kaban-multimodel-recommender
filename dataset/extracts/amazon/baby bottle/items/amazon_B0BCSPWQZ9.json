                "reviewText": "This is my second baby. I used the Haaka with the first just to collect the let down. However I wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable and I did it every single time I nursed so I think it created a bit of an oversupply. Haaka was also hard to stay on and the suction hurt. This time around I still have a very strong letdown and flow and was soaking through pads on opposite side from the one I started out feeding on. I saw this as an option from Karrie Locher and decided to purchase on a whim since not super expensive. It\u2019s so much better than Haaka - fits in your bra and stays on with minimal suction. I only leave the suction for the first few minutes of the feeding session and then I break the suction. I collect about 0.5-1.5 oz each time. I think that\u2019s well worth doing and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s creating an over supply (with Haaka I would sometimes get 3 oz). It\u2019s enough for me to pool throughout the day and give my baby a bottle once a day or every other day so he gets used to it before I go back to work. I bought the 2 pack so I\u2019d have a clean one at all times. I don\u2019t use it every time I nurse but I do when I\u2019m home especially if it\u2019s been awhile since last feed or in middle of night.",

                "reviewText": "I got these as a random curious purchase since I got tired of bringing my bigger breast pump with me or having to continuously find somewhere to pump when out with friends. I love with these that the suction is extremely strong but gentle. I can leave them on for long periods of time without hurting. They collect so much milk!!!! For some reason with these I collect more than I do when I pump with the electric one. I would recommend buying more than one pair so if you are cleaning one set you can grab the other and go.They are a little bulky so needed more room in a lot of my bras. This may just be due to my chest size I\u2019m a 36ddd.I\u2019m overall amazed at how well this product works and how easy it is to manage while on a busy schedule. It does not fall off when carrying my toddler and taking care of my newborn. Makes feeding time a breeze as I can pump with these on while feeding the newborn as well and it is still comfortable with both at the same time.Just make sure when you wear these that you bring a cooler bag with you if you plan on being out all day so you can refrigerate your milk so it does not spoil.",

I have 3 haakaas (1 I bought for myself, and then was gifted 2) and used to use them frequently. The Boon Trove is easier to put on, fits in my bra and stays on (!!!!), has a barely noticeable suction, and is surprisingly easy to pour out. I also get more milk than with the haakaa - I used to get 2-2.5 oz at most from my one breast while my baby nursed on the other. Then I worried because I was barely getting 1 oz for a while. When I started using the Boon Trove, I easily got 3 oz! My only critique is that I wish there were more measurement lines as it only shows 30/60/90 ml (1/2/3 oz). If you plan to breastfeed, get the Boon Trove!",

                "reviewText": "I purchase this after using the Haaka ladybug for a few weeks, and let me tell you, it\u2019s a GAME CHANGER! They are much more comfortable than the Haaka. They fit very nicely in my bra and are barely noticeable. I use them primarily for letdown on the opposite side when feeding and they catch A LOT. I also wear them sometimes at work at the hospital when I know I won\u2019t be able to pump for a bit. I wouldn\u2019t recommend wearing them without a bra, because once they start filling, the suction can break from the weight. They\u2019re very easy to pour the milk out, but not as easy to wash unless you have the right bottle brush. I found using the OXO bottle brush worked well for us.One issue I do have is that the base is very wobbly and is easily knocked over when it\u2019s both empty and full. I have definitely cried over spilled milk a couple times with these, so be careful!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Haakaa for a long time and I was so over it just falling off and spilling milk or how much of my nipple it sucked in. So I decided to give this a try and I will never go back! 10 times softer than the haakaa, sits nicely in my bra and I can't even feel the suction but since its only sucks in my nipple it gets so much milk everytime! Now if you need to get a clog or something strong then the haakaa would be the right choice but for just everyday use while nursing this is your new BFF.",

All the drops throughout the day add up to a bottle in the fridge for my partner to take a feeding while I catch up on sleep.I also put them in after that long nap to catch the leaking until baby is ready to feed again.They're easy to pop into my bra and easy to wash. Their shape allows for clean pouring into a small bottle, but they don't spill when I take them out or lay them next to me during after-feeding cuddles.Great design and material!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a large chested mama and could never get the hang of the haaka. Saw this was a newer product since my last baby and it looked way more comfortable. I wasn\u2019t sure it would have enough suction power but every time I\u2019d nurse on one side I would put this in the other and easily get 1-3 oz. It doesn\u2019t overflow because the suction expands and cuts off before that happens. It did not hurt at all on my sore nipples those early days which is a huge plus. I bought two! I highly recommend as a must have.",

Works great also when things are busy with the baby and I don\u2019t have time to sit still and pump. Very convenient and highly recommended.",

It's been an absolute game changer in my current breastfeeding journey. It works so well that I use it in place of pumping. I manage to collect about 2 oz each feeding while my baby nurses from the other side. I really hate pumping, so it makes a world of difference for me to not have to pump and still have a good stash of breast milk on hand. It's also super easy to clean. I strongly urge any breastfeeding mom or mom-to-be to get one of these! You won't regret it.",

I wish I had started using this right after having my baby but I'm glad I got one at 6 weeks post partum. I have been able to save 72 ounces of milk after having it for only a week! I didn't respond well to my electric pump so this has been so important in my breastfeeding journey! I previously used a Hakka in my past pregnancies but found them finicky to use. I've used this with and without a nursing bra and it's worked prefectly as long as your shirt can hold it in place and it's suctioned on properly. It may lose suction when you first place it on you, you simply need to press into the \"boon\" logo and it will activate. Hope this helps another mom who has struggled to save milk!",
