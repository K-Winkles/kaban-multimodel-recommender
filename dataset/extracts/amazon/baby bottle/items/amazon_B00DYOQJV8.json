Whether you're using baby formula or expressed breast milk, MAM bottles will support you every step of the way. MAM Easy Active Bottles have a SkinSoft textured nipple that is easily accepted by babies. The anti-slip surface at the base helps to keep it in baby's mouth, so MAM nipples are often accepted by babies when other nipples are not.The flat shape of the nipple fits perfectly in your baby's mouth, making the switch between breast and bottle easy. The ergonomically-designed bottle is easy for both parents and babies to hold, and the wide neck makes filling and cleaning easy. The bottles are also compatible with Slow Flow (0+ months), Medium Flow (2+ months), Fast Flow (4+ months), and Extra Fast Flow (6+ months) nipples.This set includes two MAM Fast Flow Silicone Nipples, accepted by 94% of babies. The bottle is made from BPS and BPA free materials. *Medical study 2011 / Market research 2010, tested with 204 mothers. ** Market research 2009-2020, tested with 1,572 babies .",

They go in the bottle sterilizer with no issues. Our children have had no trouble transitioning to different flow size nipples with this brand. Definitely recomment",

Everything looked pretty good and nothing was missing, occasionally there is some leaking but I'm not sure if that's because I need new nipples again, if its an issue with the bottle, or if it's just user error and I didn't pull the nipple all the way through. It happens are the most random rushed times and when it does leak on the occasion its leaking when I shake it between the nipple and they grey cap.",
