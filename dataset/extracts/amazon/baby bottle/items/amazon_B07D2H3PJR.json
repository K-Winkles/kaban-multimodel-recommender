The flow from the nipple is perfect for her, she rarely chokes on the milk. The measurements seem accurate and all the parts are easy to clean as well as easy to put together. The only thing I'd wish for are lower measurement readings.",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are great replacements for my Spectra S1 bottles. Perfect fit to the breast shield and way more value for the price. The only thing that I do not like is the removable rubber band in the lid that is used for sealing the bottles when the cap is screwed on. Since they are not permanently affixed, you need to make sure that you wash and dry them thoroughly before placing them back in otherwise they can start to grow mold. I have a water bottle that has the same thing and I don't use it very often for this reason. I'm a full time working mother of two and just don't have the time to wash and dry the extra parts. It's bad enough that I have to make sure all the other bottles, pump accessories, etc. are cleaned and sanitized regularly. However, I work around this problem by removing the rubber bands and only using these bottles for collecting milk when I pump at work, which is the main reason I made this purchase. I need to have clean bottles on hand for pumping several times a day. As long as I don't tip the bottles over, they won't leak. Note: they do leak without the rubber bands. I place them upright in my breast milk cooler bag, which should be used for transporting. There is greater potential for the bottles to tip if they're placed in any other type of cooler or lunch bag. Once I am home, I either freeze the milk in storage bags right away or prepare the next morning feeding bottles in my Tommee Tippee for my nanny. If I plan on traveling, then I would take the time to use the rubber bands to maintain the milk's freshness and prevent leakage while on the road. Overall, I would recommend these bottles for milk collection, not for storage or feedings unless you plan on using the rubber band.",

It was mostly for creating a freezer stash or relief pressure/clogs while I nursed, rather than someone that would use it daily to exclusively pump.Now that my daughter is onto solids, I continue to use these to freeze food for her. These bottles are sturdy and made of good quality. To be honest, they work just as well as the real bottles. Sometimes I don't even remember they aren't Avent bottles. I love how I can just pump with my Spectra S2 straight into these bottles, then later feed my daughter with an Avent nipple, and I don't have to transfer or pour milk anywhere, risking spillage.",
