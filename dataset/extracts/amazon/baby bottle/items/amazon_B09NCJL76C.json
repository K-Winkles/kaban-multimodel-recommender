The only con as you heard or read, cleaning is pain in the butt. I know you can wash them in the dishwasher but I hate that it doesn\u2019t dry completely when it\u2019s done and it takes forever. I have to separately dry them in the Dr. Brown sterilizer so that adds the extra time. Yes, I tried leaving the dishwasher open to let it dry overnight and I also put them in the bottle drying rack and there\u2019s still water in them. I\u2019m also paranoid about the dishwasher not cleaning the nipples and the vents properly so I just wash them separately. Overall it\u2019s a great bottle. As long as it works and keeps my baby comfortable after feeding.",

We bought this set for my younger sibling and his wife, who recently had a baby, we love that these bottles really do help keep the gassiness that sometimes happens when you use bottles that just leaves your little one gassy. The bottle has a stem that allows the air to escape and prevent gassiness so the little ones can burp without feeling sick.We also love the affordability of the set that we purchased, as well as the ease of which to clean them, the set also comes with a brush, several different sizes and nipples for the bottles. All in all, a good buy and an affordable set for a new family with a little one.",
