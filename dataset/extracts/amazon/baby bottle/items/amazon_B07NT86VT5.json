                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is an amazing contraption. I had one with my first baby and ordered it again this time around. I use it most in the car when we don\u2019t have time to stop for feedings as they can only drink what they pull out so choking is not an issue. I will say that it is only good once they reach 5-6 months because it requires quite a bit of suction and effort for them to get anything and then keep the nipple in their mouth. The only downfall is all the pieces you have to clean, but like I said this is a convenience and not something you use for every bottle. Definitely recommend for busy parents!",

                "reviewText": "We got the podee system for our twins at the our baby shower, and started using them when the babies were 4 weeks old. They have been a lifesaver! It gives me some sanity time while they are eating. While it does require a constant sucking, the twins caught on quickly and have adapted flawlessly. The biggest issue we have is that the twins do spit out the nipple and then cry for it to be placed in. I find this to be not the end of the world considering i don't have to hold each and feed, as this would take forever with two and while i do it on my own. I have read some of the reviews, where the parents have given the baby the bottle and gone back to bed themselves, I definitely advise against this. The bottles definitely help with the inconvenience of things, but you should never feed your child while they are lying down (these parent's didn't specify if their children were lying down or in a chair of sorts so I assume lying down). You also want to be around and aware if your child starts choking which has happened here..my daughter sometimes sucks to much to swallow and then its a whole bunch of coughing and I need to pick her up and pat her back. Plus when your child is done eating they still need to be burped or they may be in discomfort...while the Podee bottles help with gas it does not get rid of it completely. it did help with night time feeds as I took the babies out of their cribs and propped them up on my pregnancy pillow while they ate and I did lie down while they ate. The biggest issue that my twins now 4 months, are figureing out how to hold things grab things and they often grab the straw and pull it out of their mouths...and while they are getting better at putting things in their mouths they haven't quite mastered putting it back in after they pull the nipple out!! I absolutely recommend these to anyone who has multiples because the few moments of silence and sanity are the most wonderful thing! Definitely wonderful to be able to feed them while shopping or walking or in the car. I like that life doesn't have to stop because its time to feed the babies!",

                "reviewText": "I have an almost 3 month old baby and I waited over 2 weeks to receive these just for them not to work. I didn\u2019t like that they\u2019re a really fast flow at least in my opinion. My baby has nearly choked because she sucks on it and it comes out super fast and I had to just stop using it I tried using it more than twice but she would just cry and turn red because she nearly chocked. If your baby has a strong and fast suction these are not for them well at least not for me. I\u2019ll just stick to her regular bottles and I really really wanted these to work for her but they didn\u2019t :(",

I purchased another pack a few months ago, because I love the concept, but again it's iffy.Something changed over the years.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great feeding system for traveling! Worked great for my 4-7 month old daughter. Better for pacifier babies!",
                "reviewText": "I purchased my first Podee bottle in 2008 for my daughter for our long road trips to visit family. Stopping to feed a baby with a peacefully, sleeping toddler in the car wasn't always ideal! I saw a few different versions of the \"straw bottle\" but settled on this one after reading reviews. I LOVED it for her! It worked like a charm. I put the nipple in her mouth and she would start sucking away. When it was done she would spit it out and fall back asleep. It was also handy to have at the pool so she could drink a bottle in her infant carrier while I was free to feed snacks to my energetic 2 year old. I recently purchased this two pack after having our 3rd baby. It did not work quite as well for him, so it clearly has something to do with baby personalities, etc.Specs: This does take a few seconds of sucking before milk gets up to the nipple, but once they have enough sucked, a small reserve of milk stays up in the nipple so it is readily available. If the baby quits sucking, the milk in the straw goes back in the bottle, but there is still some in the nipple to get them buy while it comes back up the straw. My daughter had no problem sucking for a few seconds and was patient for the milk to come. My son wanted the milk instantly and got frustrated when it wasn't there right away. He often spit it out before he could get any. Some parents state that they \"prime\" the straw/nipple by sucking some into the nipple first. I tried this with my son (formula \"air\"- GROSS!) but it still didn't seem to help much.There are 8 pieces to this bottle: the bottle, the short straw that goes in the bottle, a screw on ring, the straw connector that goes under the ring, the long outside straw, a twist on straw connector for the nipple ring, the nipple ring, and nipple. Quite a few pieces to keep track of and clean, but the bottle comes with a long handled brush to clean the straws, and once you know how it goes together, it doesn't take that much time at all.Age: My daughter was between 4-7 months when she used this. My son was around 3-4 months when I tried with him- he was more active with his hands and would smack it out of his mouth but not able to grab it and put it back in himself. Obviously, once they can hold a bottle on their own, this is not as effective or necessary.In my opinion, babies that are used to pacifiers will take these bottles better as they are used to \"dry sucking\" for periods of time anyway. That was a clear difference between my two children who used this.Price: Great price on Amazon and I have never seen these in a store. This two pack was almost the same price as buying just one, so I kept one and gave one to a friend with twins!For anyone who travels, or has mulitples and needs extra hands, these are definitely worth a try! And not too expensive even if they don't work for your baby.",
