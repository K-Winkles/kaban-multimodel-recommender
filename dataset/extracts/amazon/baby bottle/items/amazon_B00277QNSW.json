This allows our bottles to transition safely from freezer to boiling water. The silicone sleeves provide a good gripping surface for little hands and help protect against the occasional drop. Includes 4-ounce (120 ml) bottle with Stage 1 (0-3 mos) nipple. Care and Use -Before first use, place in dishwasher or in boiling water for 3 minutes. This is to ensure hygiene. Immediately after use, disassemble individual top components (e.g. nipple from top or valve from cap). All parts are dishwasher safe (top rack only). To wash by hand: wash separately in hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly. Bottle and sleeve may be placed in the dishwasher or boiled without removal of the sleeve. If you wish to remove the sleeve, it comes off best in warm, soapy water. To allow venting and prevent nipple/valve collapse, do not over-tighten screw top From the Manufacturer Lifefactory's glass baby bottles are bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalate, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) free.",

                "reviewText": "Glass bottles and avoiding plastic are a high priority for me when it comes to choosing a bottle for my baby. These bottles have leach free glass, and don't have large plastic ventilators in them like the born free glass bottles we got. I am breast feeding our baby, and about a week into using the born free bottles I dropped an empty one and it shattered. That made me think of two things, one, glass flying everywhere is not safe, and two, what if that had been full of milk and my baby's only available meal? She is still small, only three months, but soon I can tell she will be trying to hold the bottle more when she drinks it.These bottles are more resistant to breaking than other glass bottles.Another pro of these bottles is how many colors they come in. I am trying to establish a freezer supply of breast milk, and they make it easy to keep track of what was pumped when. Because the bottles are so expensive, I pour the milk into ball jelly jars to freeze it. There is no residue left on the bottle when I pour the milk into the ball jar, even if the milk was cooling in the fridge. That is important, because if you are combining milk from different pumping sessions, you can only combine cold with cold.They do attach to the Medela pump, but not perfectly. If you tighten it to much, it will become detached. For me, that is ok, and a lot better than pumping into plastic, then pouring into glass.Some people have issues with the nipple, that has not been a problem for us at all. In fact I like this nipple better than the born free, because that one seemed to make my daughter lazy when she breast fed. With these bottles, she has to work a little more.They are expensive, but we are hoping to have more kids, and these will definitely hold up. I am also planning to purchase the sippy cup caps.",

I like that they\u2019re glass and silicon and LOVE that they are so easy to Clean with only the bottle, plastic top and nipple. They were perfect for when I\u2019d pour breast milk in but when I switched to formula recently, they can be kind of messy when making bottles because the formula scoop is about the same size as the bottle opening. It just takes a little time to get the hang of it and I make sure I wipe off the top of the bottle so it\u2019s not wet when I\u2019m trying to add the formula. It wouldn\u2019t deter me from using these again with the next baby and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll last! With my first baby, I went through several bottles because they weren\u2019t as durable as these. These will last for the next baby even! Plus they are beautiful with vibrant colors on the silicon sleeves!",

                "reviewText": "I love these bottles. I had three and bought this one so I could use these bottles exclusively (I send 4 bottles a day to daycare). The bottles look great, are study but not easily breakable, and go right in the dishwasher. I've not seen other babies using these either, which is a bonus (so bottles never get mixed up). My baby gets pumped breastmilk at daycare, so I can likely use these (won't need larger ones) until she moves on to drinking out of cups. I think these have tops you can switch out to make them sippy cups as well. Although these are 4 oz bottles, you can fit an extra 1/2 oz to an oz in there if you wanted to.I did switch out the nipples with Dr. Brown's preemie flow nipples, just because my daughter does fine with them and I'd like to avoid making bottle feeding \"too easy\" on her (so she'll still want to breastfeed). Great purchase & worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these bottles. I purchased 3. 2 4oz and 1 8oz. I was worried about using glass for obvious reasons. This bottle can really handle a lot! My daughter has tossed the bottles out of her crib, stroller and highchair without any damage to the bottle. I drive a large SUV and the bottles have fallen on the ground when I've opens her door and the trunk!!! No damage! The only thing that has done any damage to these bottles was my husband tighten the lid so tightly that the plastic lid cracked a little bit in one top. But still usable!!!It took me a few tries to perfect pouring the powder formula in the bottle but it wasn't a big deal. Measuring the exact ounces of water was never difficult I just tried to be as precise as I could be.The bottles clean so nicely! The thought of a plastic bottle or sippy just grosses me out now!I purchased the sippy top and they work great!",
