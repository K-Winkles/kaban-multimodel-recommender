                "reviewText": "I saw another reviewer mention adding the Evenflo nipple to this bottle and OMG life changer!!I originally tried the nipple that comes with the bottle on my five week old, and it was way too fast of a flow. And my son hated it. After I added the Evenflo nipple, it was amazing. I love glass bottles themselves. So the combination is perfect. The evenflo nipple fits perfectly in the ring and there\u2019s no leaking. It\u2019s lightweight for being glass. Much easier to hold than the other glass bottles I\u2019ve tried.I bought this set for 7.99 when it was on sale and I think that is a great price. As I\u2019m reviewing this, it\u2019s now listed at 18.99 and I feel like that\u2019s a bit expensive. I want to buy more, but I\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s so expensive. You can get name brand, better glass bottles, with good nipples for that price. So, I will not be buying any more unless the price comes down.",
