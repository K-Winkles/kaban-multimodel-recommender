                "reviewText": "Update: We are again using these liners in our Playtex bottles for our new baby. She is 12 weeks old, and I am still very pleased with them. No leaks, easy clean up, easy bottle filling. I like being able to get them on Subscribe & Save. We go through 8 liners/day, so a box of 100 lasts just under 2 weeks.Original review:I've been using these liners in bottles since shortly after my baby was born. We had nursing difficulty, and after several consultations with lactation, moved to exclusive pumping by about six weeks of age.I chose this type of bottle because it was what I remembered from my youth and babysitting days. (I had someone comment to me that these were so \"old fashioned\", as though that was a reason she wouldn't use them.) I love being able to get the air out of the bottle, and how the bag collapses as the baby feeds.I went into my order history, and I have bought 2400 bags (24 boxes) in recent months (plus a box I bought at a big box stores waiting on one shipment) almost entirely through subscribe & save. I have only had two bags that had any sort of defect. They we're sort of crunched up at the top of the box (perhaps due to the way they were packed in there) and the top wouldn't lay flat against the rim.I've never had a leak that wasn't my fault (a couple of times I didn't get the lid screwed on tight...user error).I like knowing that I have a clean start to each bottle -- really cuts down on bottle washing time (especially since we don't have a dishwasher).I have no issues, and would use these again for a future child.",

                "reviewText": "We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler. These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day. These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles.",

My baby had nipple confusion using other brands and it took a long time to lure him back to the breasts. With Playtex slow flow nipples baby is switch between breasts and bottles easily now.It so easy for me - easy to clean (only the nipple and the ring), easy to setup (drop in), formula can be mixed in the bottle with drop-in directly. Very light and easy to pack extras for long trip.My baby loves it!! It collapses so baby hardly suck in air; It's light weight with an open bottomed holder. My baby was able to be able to hold the bottle by the holder at feeding since 3 months old and loves the involvement.All in all to me it represents great product design - simple concept, well executed, with many benefits, and pleasant to senses. Good job!",

                "reviewText": "Some people say that these drop-ins did not keep a good seal, but I found that those individuals were trying to push all the air out through the nipple and the pressure is what broke the seal. If you want less air just press some of the air out before putting the ring on. Pressing all the air out is unnecessary. The liner does its job without pressing all the air out. The point of the collapsible liner is to not let more air in as your baby eats, and it does a fantastic job. If you would rather not buy replacement liners, Playtex VentAire takes the same nipples and does the same job with a vent at the bottom, keeping a seal when the pressure of the milk is on it, and then allowing air in through the bottom to replace the milk as the baby eats. These don't leak as long as the bottom ring is screwed on properly. I loved them because I didn't have to buy replacements and it did the same job!",

Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one. Just press in the liner from the bottom. We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner, and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner. Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple (be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow). If your fingers are not long enough, we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air.",
