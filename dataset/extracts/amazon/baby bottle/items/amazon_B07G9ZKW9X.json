                "reviewText": "So I ordered this for my 1 year old because his ped mentioned he should really drink his milk from a sippy cup. I tried and he hated it and I felt like he was still little to take the bottle away. He drinks his water and juice from a sippy but for nap/bedtime milkies he likes his bottle. I found this for transitioning and I was so excited. We have always used the Dr. browns wide neck since he was born because I breastfeed (still). I noticed these didn\u2019t have the vent so I was hesitant. We tried it and he was like \u201cwhat the hell is this mom,\u201d because of the nipple and he choked because of the bubbles and the flow. I bought vents to put inside his bottle (pictured above) and he seems to like it ALOT now. It\u2019s only the second day we\u2019ve had them. I noticed it has leaked a couple times I think that\u2019s due to the vents but I would rather it leak a little than my little one drink bubbles. Also, the designs are adorable! In conclusion, I think these are great transitioning bottles, however if your baby is used to the vents for bubbles I would recommend getting those.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this on 1/30/23 and our son didn\u2019t take it until yesterday 12/13/23. We thought he would never give up his bottle w/ nipple - he has texture issues and also very strong-willed. He is almost 3 years old and NEVER drank from anything else other than a baby bottle. This is literally the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d sippy cup/bottle. It makes sense because the shape and feel is the most similar to a traditional baby bottle. The sippy spout is soft and it\u2019s in the center of the cap, as opposed to being off-center like the other sippy cups. All the small details make a big difference. Our little one is smart too, so he can tell right away if it\u2019s too different from something he\u2019s used to. If you\u2019re in a similar situation, don\u2019t give up hope. Give your child the time they need until they are ready to do something. Keep introducing every few months until they are ready to accept it. We hope this helps! \u2026P.S. My husband made the hole in the spout bigger to make it easier for our little one to drink out from so it wouldn\u2019t take much effort for him to get the \u201cpayoff\u201d for trying to drink from a new bottle.",
