                "reviewText": "We bought the Pura Kiki Stainless Steel Infant Bottle for our 9 month old daughter. She switched to strictly bottle fed at 7 months and these bottles are a lifesaver. We tried 5 brands of glass bottles before finding Pura Kiki, including Dr. Brown's, Lifefactory, Born, Tommy Tippee and Medela. The glass bottles are heavy, can break when dropped and do not keep the milk/formula cold long enough, especially in hot weather. We were thrilled to discover stainless steel bottles, especially since the nipple is made of food-grade silicone. Unlike the other aforementioned bottles, this means *no plastic parts* in the Pura Kiki bottle! We are committed to limiting our babies exposure to plastic and if you haven't researched it yet, please look into Xenoestrogens and plastic. BPA's are not the only thing to worry about with plastic and food.Pros:- Lightweight, easy for baby to hold.- solid, quality construction - holds up well to drops and spills.- Silicone grip is makes it easier for baby to hold, fewer floor spills and easier to see in an over-stuffed diaper bag.- Stainless steel insulates against heat and keeps milk from spoiling faster- Will not break like glass when dropped (it can and will dent if dropped hard enough)- ZERO plastic parts. This is huge. I have yet to find another brand that can make this claim. All the aforementioned baby bottle brands have plastic components (cap and/or nipple) in their glass bottles.- Other nipple brands can be used with the Pura Kiki bottle as long as they are made for a standard wide-mouth bottle. We used a medela nipple and it fit, however this nipple is food-grade silicone so we use the Pura Kiki nipple with the bottle.- Simple parts. Unlike some glass bottle brands (see above), the Pura Kiki only has 4 parts: Silicone food-grade nipple, stainless steel nipple cap, stainless steel body and food-grad silicone soft bottle cap. The flow vent is built into the nipple. This makes it much easier to clean and assemble when a fussy baby want's their bottle.- The bottle cap is made of food-grade silicone. It works quite well at preventing normal drips and spills. Bonus: Our daughter loves to use it as a teether, chewing on the capped bottle.- The silicone sleeves are simple to remove and reassemble for easy cleaning.- We have different colored sleeves and this is great for keeping track of clean bottles, especially when traveling with several bottle in the diaper bag.- The 4 oz size makes a great first sippy cup with the purchase of the Pura Kiki sippy spout. Very compact and lightweight.- The Pura Kiki bottle line can go from newborn to toddler with the change of nipple to sippy spout.- It's easy to buy additional/replacement parts. We like having extra nipples and lids on hand.CONS:- The Pura Kiki nipple tends to collapse. Our baby doesn't seem to mind and while it's annoying, it's never been a game changer.- The Pura Kiki nipple also leaks, especially if the stainless steel lid is not tightened enough or is slightly off it's threads (It's a steel on steel contact, which takes a little more finessing). Being careful about tightening and properly aligning the lid seems to solve this.- The bottle drips when inverted. We just try to make sure it stays upright when the cap is off.- We've ordered the 11 ounce bottle and it's in fact an 8 ounce bottle. There are only two sizes: 4 ounces and 8 ounces, so please don't be fooled by the listed 11 ounces. The bottle does hold a full 8 ounces of liquid.The pro's far outweigh the cons, we have yet to find a bottle as convenient and safe for our baby as the Pura Kiki Stainless Steel Infant bottle. We will use this bottle for our next baby as well! After many months of trying every glass bottle we could find, we've found a bottle that works for our family. All in all, we are thrilled with Kiki Pura bottles. It's our go-to newborn gift in the four ounce size. if you're debating this purchase, buy it! you won't be disappointed. It's the only bottle we use and I know you will love it too.",

                "reviewText": "Best Baby bottle we have ever had.We bought these with out 3rd child and have loved them! The bottle design is simple and clean, which I appreciate.As far as use goes, the bottles are great. Our baby has not had any gas or colic, thanks to the vented nipples, and the stainless steel makes the bottles very easy to heat. Once you mix your formula or insert the breastmilk, simply run hot water over the outside of the bottle for 10 second increments. Stop to feel the temp of the bottle. Once the outside temp of the bottle is a temp that you feel is appropriate and safe, your done. The inside contents will match the temp of the outside bottle. If it has been refrigerated, shake the contents after running the hot water over it and the outside will adjust to the inside temp of the contents. It's so easy.The second thing I noticed is this bottle doesn't accumulate any residue like our Dr. Browns, and other plastic bottles did.The only con that i can tell you is that if you wash it in a dishwasher the painted areas will wear off quicker than if you hand wash. We have had ours for almost 4 months and the paint is still intact, but we mostly hand wash them.",

                "reviewText": "We only use these- super easy to clean, pop in the dishwasher for sterilization with no worries about plastic leaching! And the nipples are great- they have a little air release thing so babies who drink quickly won\u2019t have problems with the nipple squishing up. In addition, one of the types of Dr Browns nipples fit (possibly the wide kind?), so you can get those to change the level of flow if needed. We ended up using level three when our daughter was outgrowing a bottle, but the slower flow nipples from dr brown might be a good buy if you have a younger baby. ! Also, we bought a separate awesome straw top option which allows us to use it beyond the bottle stage. Instead of a sippy cup, We always use the straw top for liquids other than water, because the straw top is clear and you can see whether it is clean. Also, the straw assembly can be replaced, since our baby likes to chew",

                "reviewText": "My favorite bottles! So easy to clean and sterilize, and it's super quick to warm/cool them. My son loves the wide neck nipples, more than the normal sized. There was am issue with the screw lids being wonky but the company sent a new one right away and it works great. These bottles don't get that old formula smell like other bottles do even after cleaning. They are pricier (too much, imo. It's just steel, but when you dominate a market I guess you can charge what you want) but worth it to not have to buy soppy cups and food cups for the future. We will be using these bottles for a long time. I've heard the paint chips off the colored bottles, but I got the stainless natural ones. The pura logo paint hasn't chipped, and they've been sterilized over 10 times and washed hundreds of times. Plus, they're just cute. We initially purchased the Dr browns anti colic glass bottles but there were so many parts, they took so long to clean, the parts were plastic (duh, not much you can do about that), and they didn't reduce gas to any noticeable extend. We donated those and ordered more of the stainless.",
