                "reviewText": "Our baby uses the MAM bottles so I'm always a bit hesitant to introduce new bottles to her. But I was curious about this one as I like the material as I've not heard of it before. It's comfortable to hold and my little one seems to hold it much more comfortably than MAM (since that one has a thick base). The nipple she seemed to have some trouble with but I did this when she was hungry and she eventually took it. I don't understand how the anti-colic function works as MAM has a design on the base and Dr. Brown's bottles have that little green piece, so I guess I just have to trust it works. One thing is that I can't find where to buy different sized nipples. Also, I don't know what size this one is. Many babies increase nipple sizes throughout their first year, so that might be a concern here. Mine is on the same size since she was about 3 months, so I'm thinking we'll be fine. But even so, that's my only con here. The bottle itself is nice and sleek looking, as well as easy to wash and sterilize. Worth a try for sure if your little one isn't taking any of the popular brands.",
