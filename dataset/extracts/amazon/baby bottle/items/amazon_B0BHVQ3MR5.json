We use the Avent naturals and didn\u2019t want to buy more bottles to transition to sippy cups. Our son does well with it, and he does need the weighted straw because he can\u2019t figure out that he needs to tilt the bottle to drink yet.Each \u201cset\u201d comes in a little storage pod that includes the soft spout transitional nipple, a weighted straw, and an individual straw brush for each one. Four handles come with as well!Thank you so much!!! Please keep selling these. They\u2019re perfect!",

The straw is too long for the 9oz bottle and therefore doesn't work properly. The mouth part is also too long for a little one's mouth and leaks. The handles do not fit on the bottle at all. I would give 0 stars if I could. Absolutely awful. Don't waste your money.",
