But with cost in mind I seeked out something reusable. This lead me to this product. I love this product. You simply add the water, arrange the bottles and items, microwave for five minutes or less, let stand for 10 minutes and finished. Also this item is easy to clean, either by hand the parts come apart easy or by dishwasher. I also have seen the reviews of where the unit melted, I have not had that issue. My unit after microwaving doesn\u2019t run out of water or get dry enough to ever melt. It\u2019s common sense I think on that it needs the certain amount of water and certain items cannot be done it, such as metal bottle brush cleaners that were shown on another review for melting the unit. Lol an item that should never have gone in the microwave to begin with. Also if you need to use this unit back to back, I just run cool water in the unit until it cools back down before using it the second time. I do this just to make sure it doesn\u2019t get to hot and melt. Also this unit holds pretty good amount of items. But only holds 4 bottles. But with as quick as it sterilizes I have no problem using it twice a day. Would purchase again and again.",

                "reviewText": "I originally had purchased an electric sterilizer that could sterilize up to 11 bottles. I love it but it was becoming a hassle to wait 40+ minutes when all I really needed was my pumping accessories. At first I got the Dr Brown microwavable bags, but when I did the math, I realized it made more sense to just invest in this one; and I am so glad I did! I no longer use the electric one - it's so easy to wait 4 minutes and then a couple minutes for cool-down.*I saw a few reviews comment that it can be difficult to put all the bottles...I don't think so! Certainly no more difficult than the electric sterilizer! You do have to be precise in where you put stuff, but Doc already thought of that and created this with different holes to hold different things. It took me a couple tries to figure out the best system for me, but I can easily sterilize my pumping stuff and two 8 oz bottles with their accessories. I will try to remember to take a picture next time I do it - I keep meaning to but am always in such a rush!",
