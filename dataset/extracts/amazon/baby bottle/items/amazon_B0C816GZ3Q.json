The depth of the cup and the anti lump piece for the formula works to well so you aren't over shaking milk. The nipple is so perfect. The fact that it is anti colic in itself is amazing because it doesn\u2019t require additional pieces and it closely resembles the breast, helping with formula and breast fed babies. It is very easy to clean and with minimal pieces. The bottle is definently a hero and I intend to use them through all stages and sizes.",

                "reviewText": "This bottle is incredible! My baby always has milk run down his cheek and neck when he drinks and this virtually eliminated it.He also is a kinda fast drinker, especially when hungry and sometimes he chokes with other bottles, but not this one!Also, if using powdered formula, like I do on occasion, these come with strainers so no clumps get stuck in the nipple.The lettering/numbering on the side is bright and easy to read to fill the bottle to the exact amount you want.And another thing, my son seems to have less gas issues/less colicky with this bottle.It\u2019s comfortable to hold. Dishwasher (top rack) safe. Sturdy. I mean what more could you ask for!?This is BY FAR our favorite bottle.",

I love the overall design the cap twists on instead of popping on and off so overtime you don\u2019t have to worry about a loose leaking bottle and the fact that they look like a little protein shaker way too cute, the nipple is extremely soft and really does remind baby of the breast he took to them immediately",
