Even when they have their own, they want to drink from mine, but haven\u2019t mastered it without pouring it all over themselves. These allow them to sip also without spilling. I only use these supervised with them because they are small, but baby and toddler can both drink from these without spilling. I stash a couple of these in the car for when I have forgotten their water bottles, but always have a regular bottle of water on hand. They wash well in the dishwasher and push right into the top of a water bottle easily, but tough enough they stay in place. You can\u2019t sip a ton of water out with each sip, but a perfect amount for little ones. Overall, I like these and am happy to have them.",

While these would work ok for adults and responsible older kids, I might trust a 4-5 year old with them, only if they're using them outdoors. But, they're marketed for toddlers! Absolutely not! They're also marketed as leak proof. But, they're not. If you turn them upside down or sideways, and shake them some, they can leak sometimes. They don't fit snuggly enough over the bottle opening. They are easily pulled off. If you put pressure on them, they can pop off. I was trying to show they leak when shaken, and the cap popped off, making a mess. Luckily, it was only water, and that I hadn't simply offered juice to my toddler grandchild. I can imagine that sticky, juice filled mess. \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab Since these don't seal fully, they probably won't maintain carbonated drinks. Though, if they did seal fully, you wouldn't be able to use them with carbonated drinks anyways. The build up of pressure would cause the tops to pop off. I knew they wouldn't be good with carbonated drinks. It isn't an issue, since these were intended for use by a toddler. I just wanted to mention it for others. I would have rated them at 4 stars. But, given the fact that they're marketed for toddlers, I rated them at 3 stars.",

I tried several times for this review and you can see in my above video that they definitely leak and with just a small squeeze they expel water all over the place.If you have kiddos and teens that have a nervous habit and like to squeeze their water bottles (I am guilty of that too) these bottle caps will not work for them. I tried these on 20 Oz water bottles for reference.Every single one of them did the same thing they leaked or blew out the water if squeezed or dropped.Perhaps if just used very carefully these may work casual walks or to keep in your cup holder in your vehicle but for my bunch these don\u2019t work. I do love the colors and I do admire the design of these but my search for finding bottle caps that stay on and don\u2019t leak is still ongoing! I feel badly that these didn\u2019t work for me. The colors are pretty, non-toxic food grade silicone six bottle tops for a great price! They\u2019re just unfortunately not leak or spill proof.",

                "reviewText": "So I am not going to lie I got these for me, an adult.. no toddler or kids because a lot of the cheaper water bottles I can buy are screw tops and if I'm in a rush it annoys me to unscrew to drink these fix that SO WELL... as long as your drink has no carbonation in it or is sparkling as that will put pressure on the top and it WILL slip off if the bottle falls, turned upside down or is shaken in anyway but that's not a fault of the product at it was made for basic drinks like juice and water and possibly milk.It WILL NOT fit anything larger than a basic/standard bottle mouth like those on soda bottles, basic water bottles (think those are 16oz i'm thinking of). I don't notice any leaks when I tested them with the cap on but did notice after some use if the cap is off it will leak but didn't try no cap before drinking so it might work but I assumed no leaks if sealed. Just pop the cap off stick in mouth and drink, you do not have to bite it to get liquid but it makes it a lot easier.",
