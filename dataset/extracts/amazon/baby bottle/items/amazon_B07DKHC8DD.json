                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Ant-Colic Bottle",
                "reviewText": "This bottle is fantastic. I have had to bottle feed my baby since she was 2 weeks old due to tongue and lip ties. I have also had to feed her formula exclusively because of not producing milk. I have tried multiple bottles: Playtex, Kiinde, Mam, Chico, Nuk, and more importantly Dr. Brown's. Out of all of these Dr. Brown's was the best, but definitely still not great. My baby was still in pain and uncomfortable after eating, and I wanted something better. After further researching anti-colic bottles I came across Natursutten bottles, and they have changed everything. My baby still has to burp, but she does not get the painful gas that would last several hours. Her reflux has improved, and she is much more calm and happy after eating. I am not using the nipples it comes with because my baby can't handle faster flow, even the slow ones are too fast for her. She will be able to use them in a few months, though. For now she uses Dr. Brown's nipples, and they work well even with the anti colic valve. I'm so thankful to this company for designing a product that is so simple and much more efficient at reducing air intake during bottle feeding. Also, not having as many complicated parts to wash is a nice perk. They are also durable, I have dropped them in my stainless steel sink a few times on top of each other and they didn't even chip. I don't do that often and have changed how I wash them in the sink because they are glass and glass is breakable, no matter how well it is made. That said, these are definitely worth the price, and as far as I am concerned the best anti-colic bottles money can buy. I now use Natursutten bottles exclusively and will never go back to other brands. If your bottle fed baby struggles with feeding and has difficulty with gas, reflux, etc., please consider these for your little one. I have had so many problems with other bottles causing intense discomfort and pain for my baby, and these have improved her comfort and enjoyment of feeds by 90-99%.",

Once my milk came in, baby no longer had patience with this slow flow nipple. I really love these bottles but wish the nipple didn\u2019t have a notch / was more sloped like a breast.",

                "reviewText": "I bought some 4 and 8 ounce glass bottles for my newborn because I didn\u2019t want to add even more plastic contaminants into her life. Plastic is hard to avoid nowadays but it seems like every day you hear more research about forever chemicals, micro plastic, and plastic pollution. Every day we learn more about the long term consequences to our kids\u2019 health and development. We take so many precautions with our kids and we put so much effort into helping them have the best life every day, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to give them something dangerous to suck on all day long.These glass bottles are tough and stand up to some abuse, and they\u2019re super easy to keep clean. The natural latex nipples are great too. Took our kids a couple days to get used to them after getting plastic ones at the hospital, but it was a minimal effort. After several months one of the nipples was getting extra tacky and I learned that that\u2019s normal and not a big deal, but we just replaced it with a new nipple. They\u2019re not expensive.I don\u2019t know how much safer exactly these bottles and nipples are than plastic ones, but I know that they simply are and for me that\u2019s worth it.",

                "reviewText": "these bottles are amazing in almost every way. they are non toxic and the nipple is natural rubber so it\u2019s the best choice for your baby in terms of materials you\u2019re feeding them with. but i have a big issue with their anti colic plastic device. it is supposed to help less air enter your babies stomach, and create a good flow with air and milk, but instead it creates a lot of problems. it makes milk stay in the nipple after use even when l the bottle is turned upright, so unless the baby sucks every ounce of milk gone, whenever you open the lid the contents from the nipple will spill out, and leak everywhere. the bottle also has to be tipped straight up to get enough milk in the nipple at first so they aren\u2019t just sucking air. after that it\u2019s fine. the other thing is with the anti colic piece is it doesn\u2019t let enough milk flow with the fast flow nipples. i tried using these bottles without this anti colic piece but it makes the nipple cave in and your baby would have to open their mouths to allow air to go back in the bottle to replace the liquid they sucked out. i\u2019m working on a solution to these issues, and if you have any ideas let me know. because these still manage to be my all time favorite bottles as any others we\u2019ve tried have just as many cons if not more. i love the design and look of these and just wish something could be done about the milk leaking out of the nipple when it\u2019s opened. anyways i think they\u2019re worth the money because the glass is such high quality compared to most brands. we\u2019ve dropped it many times and it hasn\u2019t broken. they are very easy to clean as well. i think they are worth buying and using over any other brand i know of.",
