At the bottom it has some dinosaur designs that may disappear over time. Each bottle has a capacity of 8 ounces =250 milligrams.They are a comfortable proposition for children and are BPA free. In addition to having these advantages, they are also anti-colic, which means that they have an opening which helps the air not to get trapped inside the bottle and the child breathes in air and this causes colic.They have a medium flow nipple and are designed for infants 3 months and older.Something I notice is that washing takes longer than traditional bottles.",

My only complaints would be that the cap is hard to remove, and they are hard to clean. If you rinse them right after use it's fine but if you were to leave any formula or milk in them for a longer period of time before washing its hard to clean the bottom of the bottle for obvious reasons. Otherwise they are nice bottles.",

The window on the front of the box shows you what you get inside, and that is uniquely shaped bottles which allow the baby to easily hold them. Each has a cute cat head picture on the front too.These are for my granddaughter-to-be, but with a medium flow nipple, it will be a little bit of time before she can test it. What I fan tell you is that the bottles' covers are super secure - I had to ask my husband to open one for me. But that reassures that knocking a bottle over means it won't leak. The plastic is a nice thickness too.",

At first glance I wasn\u2019t sure what it was about them that was supposed to make them anti-colic, so I read further down in the description. It states that the nipples on the bottle have valves that flex and adjust the flow of milk as your baby drinks.",
