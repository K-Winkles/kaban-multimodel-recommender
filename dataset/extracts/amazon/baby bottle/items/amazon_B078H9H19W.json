        "description": "This is no ordinary bottle. Tommee Tippee Advanced Anti-Colic bottles work a little differently from regular bottles to help combat colic while ensuring a comfortable feeding experience for you and your baby. The unique 3-piece anti-colic venting system draws air away from milk and the star valve keeps milk from traveling up the tube, meaning less gas, reflux and discomfort 84% of moms who used our Anti-Colic bottles agreed they reduced their baby's colic symptoms.* Plus, the anti-colic venting tube comes with a built-in heat sensing strip that gives you extra reassurance that the milk is a safe temperature for baby. Loved by moms and babies, our easy latch-on, breast-like nipple feels closer to skin and mimics the natural flex and movement of a mom's breast for a comfortable feeding. 95% of moms reported that their baby accepted the super soft silicone nipple with skin-like feel and would recommend to others.*Easy to clean and suitable for use in the dishwasher, microwave and steam sterilizers. 100% BPA-free for complete peace of mind.We offer different flow rates to keep up with your growing baby. Every baby is different but as a guide we suggest slow flow for 0+ months, medium flow for 3+ months and fast flow for 6+ months. Advanced Anti-Colic nipples are only compatible with Advanced Anti-Colic bottles. We recommend changing your bottle nipples every two months. And you should change them immediately if they're damaged or weak.The Closer to Nature Travel Baby Bottle and Food Warmer doesn't require electricity and is a convenient and fuss-free way to heat baby bottles and baby food on the go. It heats everything from breast milk or formula to baby food in jars or pouches. Its compact enough to fit in your baby's changing bag so you're able to heat feeds anywhere, anytime.* Based on 2021 study of 524 parents who use Tommee Tippee bottles.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on this fantastic baby bottle set, and it's been a game-changer for our feeding routine. The portable bottle warmer is a lifesaver for on-the-go meals, heating up bottles quickly and evenly. The included scrub brush makes cleanup easier. The bottles do have multiple parts to clean so that is kind of a draw back. However , it doesn't take away from the effectiveness of the bottle itself. Plus, the pacifiers have been a hit with my little one, offering comfort when it is most needed. It's the all-in-one solution that I didn't know I needed, but now can't live without!",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are awesome. The anti colic is perfect. No leaks. Great nipple for my baby! He would still breastfeed AND stake this bottle. Never caused any latching issues. Now we do formula and he loves the bottle still. I love the ability to size up slowly for the nipples. My baby has severe reflux and had bad gas and colic for a while, and these really did the job on minimizing it all. Highly recommend these bottles! The ONLY flaw is how wide they are and they don\u2019t fit in my insulated bottle pockets in my diaper bag, but that\u2019s how you get the breast like design at the top so we just store our milk in separate thinner bottles with caps, and pour them into these bottles when ready to feed.",
