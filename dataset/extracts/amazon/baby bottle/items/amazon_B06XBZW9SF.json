The only thing I dislike is the top doesnt shape to the nipple area perfectly and when you shake the bottle, some fluid may come out inside the cap. There are 2 venting holes in the bottle that I like as well. Easy to disassemble as well for cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "So, we've been Mam bottles users since my daughter was born and she's now almost 9 months old.They've worked really well for us. I'll list the things I don't like with them quickly and then move onto the main reason I ordered the Olababy bottles.Main dislikes of Mam:- 4 pieces to clean.- The base collects water and takes an extra wiping after putting in the bottle warmer.- The 8oz. bottle is tall, annoyingly so, doesn't fit in the lunchbox we've used since she was born and drinking it in her crib is uncomfortable for her (we'll be moving away from crib bottles soon, but there is a period of time when that should be taken into consideration).The latter is why we decided to look at another bottle brand. I've used comotomo in the past as a nanny and knew I wouldn't like that they fall over easy, I've also used Dr. Browns, Avent, and BornFree. Since she can hold her bottles now, I went with these for comfort, along with the fact that they can stand up without falling over. The Mam bottles the nipple isn't round, so you have to have the bottle turned a certain way. This bottle has a round nipple, but with it being offset, it also has the requirement of needing to be held a certain way. My baby manages to get it turned back to the correct position when she decides to twist the bottle in her mouth, but I'm sure she spills a little through the vent here and there.I love these bottles a whole lot more, 3 pieces to clean, slow flow nipple (even purchased slow flow for the larger size bottles), transitional sippy top (purchased, haven't used yet), and silicone handle (also haven't used yet) are all really cool features. We'll use one of her 5 oz. bottles as her sippy cup this week.My baby isn't picky at all, she wasn't breastfed (the latch was too painful), so I've been pumping since she was born. She has only used the Mam bottles, but had zero issues adjusting to the Olababy. New things are her favorite right now, so I didn't see it being a problem. I like that the larger size Olababy bottle is not as tall as the Mam ones. They still fit in her lunchbox and the silicone adds to the grippiness of the bottle, so she can hold it easier than Mam. We love the Mam trainer sippy cups though, so should be interesting to see if we decide we like the Olababy accessories better. We'll keep both sets of bottles for the next baby just in case we end up with a picky one.As a reference for new parents:I'd recommend getting 5-8 of the smaller bottles (makes it easier to pack them and clean them when your baby is little). We used 8 ourselves, but always had one or two clean, even after not doing bottle dishes that day, so I'd say 6 would work well.And only 3-5 of the larger size bottles. Once your child is drinking 6+ ounces a sitting, they are only having a max of 5 bottles a day. We've just moved ours to 6 ounce bottles and she's drinking 5 bottles over the day and night. Every now and then she'll have a snack bottle of 2-3 ounces (leftover from a pump), so we use the smaller size bottles still (and will convert that size to a sippy).",

                "reviewText": "It took months to get my daughter to transition from nursing to a bottle once it was time for her to go to daycare. We tried everything. All the bottle brands - you name it, we tried it. She had a tongue tie and significant lip tie, so she developed a odd suckle and rejected everything. Our lactation consultant suggested something with a softer top, much closer to the feeling and flexibility of a breast. We borrowed one of these from a friend, just to try before committing, and she took to it so quickly! We bought several - big, small, sippy cup top, multiple colors, etc. and she still uses them. Bonus: THEY ARE SO EASY TO CLEAN! They can go into the dishwasher but we prefer to clean them by hand and you don't need any special bottle brushes. It is wide enough for my regular sponge wand to clean all the way around. It takes seconds to wash which is so great when your kid is already screaming at you for a bottle.",

I love that these have the offset nipple to help reduce air intake while feeding and lend itself to a more \"natural\" latch so we can switch more easily with breastfeeding.The quality feels great, they're super easy to clean.And the milk or formula only touches silicone.The only negative is that the base is narrow, so they tip over pretty easily.",

                "reviewText": "I was going home for lunch at work or had baby delivered to me during lunch breaks so I could feed her. But, I persisted and of course the winner of bottles was the last choice. Adiri is a stress reliever. When i received it, my hopes were shot and didnt really have any expectations. Ive tried lansinoh, nuks, ola, minbie, playtex (2) versions, avent (2) versions, dr brown bottles and sippy cup, tommee tippie, comotomo. I was ready to have my hubby and nanny use a syringe to feed my baby while i was at work. lol. If you find this review helpful, please click the helpful button as I spent a good time writing it and I hope it helps others who has a picky baby with bottles. It can be costly and frustrating.The main matter with all the bottle is finding the right nipple. I wish there was 1 bottle that fit all nipples. The problem with many of the bottle is the plastic silicone feeling of the nipple. My baby did not like it and always gave us the foreign disgusted look. So i am going to do a nipple review. What we found is that the medical grade silicone is the best of all.Adiri - the cost of the bottle is medium range but wont break the bank. You can find sales to get the lowest cost. The texture of the nipple is soft silicone medical grade & nipple is shaped like a real nipple. It has an identical shape like comotomo, ola, and tommee. But the shape of adiri base is rounded & my baby latched onto it like a real breast. You have to heat it with the bottle cap on and the cap for airvent or air and water will get inside.Comotomo Vs Ola - these 2 are almost the same. My baby liked the soft feeling of the 2 bottles. Baby didnt like the plastic silicone nipple for comotomo. But she didnt turn away the ola nipple. Ola nipple is identical to adiri nipple but has a wide base. The difference is adiris nipple material is the same as half of base of ola... and is also the same for lansinoh nipple. Adiris nipple material is fully covered w/ soft silicone. Ola's packaging was not good. It came open and brokenLansinoh - a unique nipple compared to all the bottles. Baby was not latching to this bottle but didnt turn it away. The base of the nipple is made of soft silicone like adiri. But the tip was the plastic silicone feeling material. Thats when we realized that she does not like that material and i need to find the soft silicone.Nuks - shape is also unique almost like mams. I thought my baby would def like 1 of these. But no winner. The soft silicone is at the bottom of the nipple tip of nuks. And i got 3-6 mths flow for nuks but it was fast flow. Everytime baby tried to suck, milk would pour out too fast for her. At the end, she did not want it anymore. She also did not like that plastic feeling on top of the nipple.Mams - before i wanted to buy mams, i bought their pacifier to see if she would take it since its similar to nuks. And she did not like the material eitherTommee Tippie - out of all the bottles, this was the only one I had problems for leakage. She did not latch onto this bottle and gave us the questioned disgusted look like with all the other failed bottles.Dr Brown - i really like dr brown. I didnt mind washing and cleaning the compartments. It didnt leak. My baby played with the nipple for dr brown. The nipple is identical to playtex. I would get confused with which cover goes to which bottle. She would not latch on the nipple. So we tried dr brown sippy cup. My baby would bite the sippy cup and she would be able to get some milk out of it. A light snack to hold her over while she waits for me. So the sippy cup is definitely a keeper.Playtex ventaire - old and new version. Same nipple as dr brown. The handling of bottle is nice. But the nipple base was small for my baby and so it doesnt feel like the real deal.Minbie - the most expensive out of all.. $25. I couldnt order this through amazon. The manufacturer is based in australia. I ordered it due to the unique shape of nipple and it looks like the shape of a real nipple. High hopes for this one. But, the foreign and disgusted face is what baby gave us. So it confirms that we needed to order a diff material than all the other bottles. It is not the shape of the nipple, it is the feeling of the nipple. You cannot clean the nipple with the brush due to its delicate material. The nipple is soft, but also plastic feeling.Avent - i tried the colic free and regular. My baby started with these bottles when she was a newborn. We used it for a month. I liked it a lot. No problems with leaking. When we stopped using bottle for 3 weeks, she refused it. She did not like the plastic silicone material anymore",
