                "reviewText": "We've introduced bottles to our almost 1-month old and they are splendid. They don't fit the Spectra pump we use but that's no problem. We save milk in silicone bags and pour off a meal's worth each time. The bottle goes into a Phillips warmer and gets nice and toasty.I like glass, to hold and to clean. With few parts, these are quickly hand-washed and set to dry. Every part seems to be well-constructed; I noticed the Made in Germany stamp on the nipple. Speaking of which, they are indeed slow flow. No major gas problems have resulted from feeding and the baby doesn't have bottle preference over the breast. With these, you get what you pay for in spades.",

These are wonderful bottles, they hold the perfect amount of milk, and the glass is very strong. I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are looking for a high quality bottle.

                "reviewText": "My exclusively breastfed, nine-week-old baby was having trouble with the Medela bottles. The nipples are too long. This bottle has a shallower, flatter nipple, which more resembles Mom's. My baby had far less trouble adjusting to this nipple. I highly recommend for babies who have only been fed from Mom's breast who want to transition to a bottle.",
