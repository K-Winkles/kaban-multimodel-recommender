        "description": "The Philips Avent Anti-colic nipple flow 3 is a medium flow nipple, which is great for growing babies drinking from a bottle. The anti-colic valve integrated in the nipple is designed to keep air away from your baby's tummy to reduce colic and discomfort. As your baby feeds, the valve flexes to allow air into the bottle to prevent vacuum build up and vents it towards the back of the bottle. It keeps air away from baby\u2019s tummy to help reduce colic and discomfort. The nipple shape allows for a secure latch and the ribbed design helps prevents collapse for uninterrupted, comfortable feeding. The anti-colic nipple is made of flavorless, odorless, soft, silicone that resists discoloring and stickiness, a BPA free material. Philips Avent Anti-colic nipples are available in different flow rates, to keep up with your baby\u2019s growth. We recommend replacing nipples every 3 months for hygiene reasons. Use Philips Avent Anti-colic bottles only with Philips Avent Anti-colic nipples. Includes 4 Flow 3 Anti-colic bottle nipples. SCY763/04.",

My boy can\u2019t handle anything more than the number one so I had to order these to replace the number twos. These are great nipples and the only style that my boy can get a good latch on Without breaking a seal. I can tell a difference between our old number ones and these, which means they do stretch out overtime but not enough to cause any choking issues.",

                "reviewText": "PLEASR READ FULLY : The lv.1 flow for my newborn was easy peasy UNTIL the cluster feedings & growth spurt emerged as he hit 1month. As a first time mom i couldnt really figure out at first why my son kept getting so angry & fussy during his feeds (squirming more than usual, flinging his arms & legs & also aggressively trying to grab the bottle) but it also grabbed my attention during every feeding because when hes not feeding, hes a very calm & quiet baby.So one night after grabbing his bottle out the warmer (Avent bottle warmer helps tremendously. My son loves warm breastmilk because it puts him asleep faster. I exclusively pump to stock up on more breastmilk so im not held up at the breast in case he demands more milk flow) i watched him closely as he fed & noticed it took forever for the milk to flow, before you know it an hr went by & it look like he didnt feed at all.. he became frustrated & when i took a sip (YES i needed to physically see what was the issue\u2026& it helped me figure out the problem) the milk was coming out wayyyy too slow & did my research on milk flow consistencies & boom! I figured out my son needed a Lv.2 flow.I was eager to order mine & did an overnight shipment & hes no longer fussing, flinging his arms/legs nor grabbing at the bottle like hes desperately hungry. My boy done finished his 4oz milk in 20min with his lv.2 flow & he was knocked out. Im VERY SATISFIED.I highly recommend. Had i not sipped that milk to figure out the lv.1 nipple was feeding milk out too slow\u2026 i wouldnt had figured out the issue..",
