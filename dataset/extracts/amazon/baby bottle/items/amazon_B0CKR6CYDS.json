They\u2019re easy to clean and easy to assemble. The nipple cover that screws on instead of having to pop it on and off is a godsend. Plus they\u2019re just so cute. 10/10 no complaints!",

They aren\u2019t very newborn friendly, the nipple flow is too quick and my baby was drinking too fast ,absorbed air, making him more gassy. But now at 2 months they are great for him. They are lightweight, easy to carry around. The wide neck opening makes them very easy to clean and sterilize.",

So when I saw these, it said it was similar to MaM nipples for bottles. My granddaughter loves these bottles and she just turned 9 months. It looks like a sippy cup, but it\u2019s really a bottle. We have the MAM sippy cups. So we only use this bottle for her formula bottles.",

They also struggled to latch properly and we were going thru burp cloths like crazy! We have been through multiple types of bottles and nipple sizes and nothing was working. I randomly found these bottles and gave them a try. They fit perfectly in my babies mouth and the shape allows them to seal and latch perfectly. They bottles don't clog up with the oatmeal either. I couldnt even explain how much these bottles have changed my twins eating we are so thankful!",
