The weight distribution is better than the slim bottles so she can hold it much easier on her own. The wide neck design makes it easier to clean as well. I have never had a leaking issue with these bottles, the only time I did was when my baby started struggling with the nipple size and was pushing it in, so I just sized up and no more leaks.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve tried many bottles but our baby seems to do best with the nipple and flow of these wide neck Dr brown bottles. The only thing is that they\u2019re a pain to wash with the extra inner venting system. The bottle can be used without it but when I tired a couple times, I noticed that it creates a like a vacuum sensation and makes the nipple collapse a little while my baby is sucking on it. So I have to pull the nipple out of her mouth to let the air release and the nipple pops back up again. Kind of a pain.We also noticed that the bottle leaks sometimes while we\u2019re feeding our baby. It doesn't happen all the time so we aren\u2019t sure what causes it. It also leaks when we\u2019re warming milk in the bottle in warm water. It seems like some sort of pressure is created in the bottle that makes the milk come out of the top. What helped with this was making sure the top is screwed on super tight but then it makes it hard to screw the top off after!Because of these issues, we would switch bottle brands but prefer not to since our baby does well with them.",

The designs are super cute and the bottles are very sturdy. I have now bought bigger teats as my baby has grown and they are easily replaced in the lids. Just make sure to use the white stopper if putting a full bottle in your bag to stop leaks. I learned this the hard way with a pram bag soaked through. They don't leak when feeding though which is confusing.",
