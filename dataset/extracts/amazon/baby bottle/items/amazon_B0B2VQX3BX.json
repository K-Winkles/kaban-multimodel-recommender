It's easy to think that you won't ever drop a glass bottle but when you are tired or when bottles get wet from slobber or water, they become very slippery! These are nice to have as a protector. they are also nice because you can keep them on when cleaning since they are silicone. I love that you can still see the oz measurements on the side even with the silicone on. and they fit perfectly! Highly recommend",

However, the only problem I have is that I try to align the side slits to the measurement indicator on the bottle and sometimes it is not easy. The reason for aligning the slits to the measurements is to be able to see how many ounces I am pouring into the bottle and/or to see how many ounces my baby drank. Honestly, besides that, it does its job.",
