The design and material is high quality and I am very impressed! My breast fed baby took to these bottles right away without any hesitation which was such a relief. The smaller bottles come with slow flow nipples (s) which are a perfect flow. I purchased the extra slow flow (ss) nipples but I do not think they were needed. The larger size bottles come with medium (m) which we will switch to soon.",

                "reviewText": "Great bottle.Pros: Couldn't find lansinoh 5oz glass bottle so I bought this instead since my baby will only take nipple of this specify shape. Lansinoh and Pigeon brand also have lead paint controversy so I was hesitant.The nipple is soft and baby likes it a lot.Truly slow flow!One Con: the top cover is hard to pop off. When trying to pop it off the whole top with the nipple unscrews unless very careful. (Which is hard sometimes when you have baby on one hand and trying to juggle the bottle on the other).",

I don\u2019t know if it was the purpose but I think it helped her establish an even better latch then before.super easy to clean. Only concern with the glass is my baby growing more and being able to throw and break them. But I will find out eventually! Will be getting more.",
