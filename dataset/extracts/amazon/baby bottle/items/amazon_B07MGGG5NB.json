                "reviewText": "I actually accidentally bought these. I had received some used narrow dr brown\u2019s bottles from my cousin, and I was going to sanitize them and replace the nipples, but when i ordered these I hadn\u2019t noticed they were wide neck nipples.Well fast forward, i\u2019m phasing through all of our bottles(we had a few of each brand) and the Dr Brown\u2019s ones are the only ones he does well with. The others he will refuse to drink, and then I realized, these nipples were already sanitized by me, they\u2019re dr brown\u2019s, and they FIT THE PHILIPS AVENT BOTTLES!! It doesn\u2019t seem like it really matters but we only had two Dr Browns bottles but really we had two more because these nipples fit the bottle perfectly. I even ordered more nipples to fit some philips bottles we got at the baby shower that we wouldn\u2019t use otherwise. Awesome.",

With level 1 nipples, it took a long time, and she'd give up, affecting her sleep. Switched to level 2, and now she eats more quickly, sleeps longer. Tip: Try new nipples during the day to monitor intake and avoid choking at night.",

                "reviewText": "We really struggled to find a slow enough nipple for transitioning our newborn from breast to bottle. Even the slowest flow of any brand was just too fast. She hated the skinnier nipples. She is not a preemie, but the preemie nipples have been a lifesaver because it slows her feeding way down. No issues so far going back and forth being 1/2 breastfed and 1/2 bottle fed.",

As my baby grew, I could easily switch between slow, medium, and fast flows, ensuring a comfortable feeding experience at every stage. One downside is that the extra parts, including the vent insert and tube, require thorough cleaning, adding a step to the washing routine. Another downside is that sometimes it leaks, even when you screw everything together tightly.",
