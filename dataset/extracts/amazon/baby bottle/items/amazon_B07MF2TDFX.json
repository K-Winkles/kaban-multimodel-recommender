She would take just about any bottle, but this one was easier on her tummy. We have had a couple of them leak, but it\u2019s always been user error. I wouldn\u2019t trust the reviews complaining of leaking, especially if your bottle is just upside down. There is probably a better way to store your bottle. They come with caps to insert inside to prevent leakage while traveling. It\u2019s super simple. We\u2019ve also had no issues of melting. It\u2019s honestly a little concerning that some of these reviewers are taking care of babies but can\u2019t properly use a baby bottle. Anyways.",

I have twins and it has helped me a lot with the issue of colic,they are going to be 3 months old and for the first time I have not had even a colic crisis lasting more than two hours in them. The nipple has excellent quality, there\u2019s no milk drawing, the only difficult thing is when it comes to washing them because they have 2 additional pieces but at least for me that is not a problem. I'm going to buy the 9 ounce ones soon.If you want good bottles and avoid excess colic in your baby, this is your best option.",

As my baby grew, I could easily switch between slow, medium, and fast flows, ensuring a comfortable feeding experience at every stage. One downside is that the extra parts, including the vent insert and tube, require thorough cleaning, adding a step to the washing routine. Another downside is that sometimes it leaks, even when you screw everything together tightly.",
