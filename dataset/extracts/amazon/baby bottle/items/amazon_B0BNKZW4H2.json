Because my daughter has to have her bottles made each morning for daycare I found myself struggling to keep them all up in a bag so I ordered this bag. I'm able to make her bottles at night and just stick them in the bag in the fridge. Pull it out in the am and take it to daycare. It stays cool while on the way to daycare due to the cool pack that was also included in the bag. Love this and you cannot go wrong!",

                "reviewText": "Just the cold pack alone makes this purchase worth it the cooler is so so but as a pumping mom the cold pack makes pumping at night so much more bearable. I live in a two-story house so usually pumping at night means going downstairs and putting my milk away each night to make sure that it's fresh for my baby. I tried getting a refrigerator and it didn't work it just created way too much condensation on the ground I thought that was safety hazard I tried other coolers but the parts would just fall over the place. I was just about to give up and go back to just cleaning each time and putting my milk in the fridge at night and then I stumbled upon this.The cold pack keeps your pump parts upright and secure it also makes sure that the cold is evenly distributed amongst the bottles to keep everything nice and cool all night long. I do recommend an extra cold pack or two at the bottom so at the base of the cold pack to make sure that it stays cold all night but it works it stays cold it keeps everything secure and now I can get a little more sleep.I do wish that the bag was more durable and that the Zipper was a little more quieter but the size is perfect for your pump parts so realistically they work in tandem and I couldn't recommend this product enough",

                "reviewText": "We've had this for 3 months with daily daycare usage. There are no tears, stains, etc. The white stripes even look like it's still brand new. Really like that it came with it's own cooling block. Fits the dr browns bottles perfectly. We've never had a bottle spill or fall over and I am not easy on things when packing up. We have room on top to place a small plastic bento type container for our baby's snacks as well. The only thing I wish it had was a designated spot to write their name or a laminated pocket for one of those name cards. The fabric is such that the name stickers I put on everything else doesn't adhere well.",

This one is great for daycare now that she is eating more food I can pack her 3 doctor browns bottles on one side a squeeze pouch a water cup and then her food containers and snacks on top. It is perfect everything is contained in one place and also looks nice. Also highly recommend the black because it wipes off so easy it can be washed off in the sink for any spills and also comes with a carry strap. The back pocket is great for utensils snacks and even wipes. This ice chest is a must have for a little!",
