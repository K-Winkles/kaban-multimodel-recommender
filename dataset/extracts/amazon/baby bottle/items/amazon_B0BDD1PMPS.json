        "description": "Inspired by moms and designed by experts, our Natural Start Anti-Colic Baby Bottle has an extra-wide neck and breast-like nipple to help your baby have the most natural bottle-feeding experience. Made from super soft silicone, the nipple is Closer to Nature because it has a special breast-like shape that encourages a natural latch and prevents nipple confusion when switching between bottle and breast. This works by mimicking the flex and movement of mom\u2019s breast, allowing your baby to feed at a pace that feels comfortable and natural to them. It also features an anti-colic valve to prevent the symptoms of colic by ensuring your little one ingests more milk and less air. Thanks to its brand-new design, the Natural Start baby milk bottle is now self-sterilizing, making clean-ups a whole lot easier. Follow these simple steps to sterilize your bottle in the microwave in just 3 minutes*: Step 1: Thoroughly clean your bottle in warm, soapy water and rinse Step 2: Fill the bottle with 50ml of cold water Step 3: Fit the nipple, screw ring and cap together and loosely place them on the bottle base. Pop in the microwave for 3 minutes Step 4: Remove the water inside the bottle and reassemble Please note that the time to sterilize will change slightly based on how many bottles you place in the microwave at once. For added peace of mind, the Natural Start baby bottle is completely mess-free and leakproof when the screw ring, nipple and cap are all secured (even if it\u2019s turned upside down or shaken). It\u2019s also 100% BPA free so it\u2019s safe for your baby. However you choose to feed your baby - whether it\u2019s breast milk, formula or a bit of both - our Natural Start Anti-Colic bottles are #1 for easily switching between bottle and breast*. *Based on an independent survey of 1,006 UK moms of 0-12m who have used bottles, Feb 2023 **Based on placing one bottle in microwaves from 700-1000w. Sterilizing time increases with every bottle added to the microwave ***Tested against pseudomonas, E.coli, staphylococcus and aspergillus brasilliensis",

Change them if they get damaged or bitten by tiny teeth. Closer to Nature baby bottles are ONLY compatible with Closer to Nature nipples and cannot be used with advanced anti-colic bottle nipples. Squeeze me When assembling your baby bottle, hold the nipple up to the light to check the slit in the silicone isn\u2019t sealed closed. If it has, pinch it gently between your fingers or with nipple tongs to re-open. If the valve has sealed closed, your bottle won\u2019t vent properly.",
