                "reviewText": "We had a set of the glass bottles in the 4oz size and our baby started eating more so we were gifted this set. I was happy to get a new set of bottle rings because ours had seen better days, but the new ones leak constantly. You have to put the nipple on SO TIGHT if you don\u2019t want milk just running out under the ring. Then the nipple is on too tight to get any ventilation and collapses. There\u2019s a fine line you need to find between leaking and venting, and it\u2019s so hard to locate. Very frustrating during night feeds. Other than that, love the glass bottles!",
