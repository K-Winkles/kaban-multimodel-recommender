        "description": "With our award-winning** Advanced Anti-Colic baby bottle, switching between breast and bottle feeding has never been simpler. With our breast-like nipple and unique anti-colic technology, it could just be the best thing for baby, since you! Inspired by mom, designed by experts. This is no ordinary bottle. Tommee Tippee Advanced Anti-Colic bottles work a little differently from regular bottles to help combat colic while ensuring a comfortable feeding experience for you and your baby. The unique 3-piece anti-colic venting system draws air away from milk and the star valve keeps milk from traveling up the tube, meaning less gas, reflux and discomfort \u2013 84% of moms who used our anti-colic bottles agreed they reduced their baby\u2019s colic symptoms.* Plus, the anti-colic venting tube comes with a built-in heat sensing strip that gives you extra reassurance that the milk is a safe temperature for baby. Loved by moms and babies, our easy latch-on, breast-like nipple feels closer to skin and mimics the natural flex and movement of a mom's breast for a comfortable feeding. 95% of moms reported that their baby accepted the super soft silicone nipple with skin-like feel and would recommend to others.* Easy to clean and suitable for use in the dishwasher, microwave and steam sterilisers. 100% BPA-free for complete peace of mind. Which flow rate do I need? We offer different flow rates to keep up with your growing baby. Every baby is different but as a guide we suggest slow flow for 0+ months, medium flow for 3+ months and fast flow for 6+ months. Advanced Anti-Colic nipples are only compatible with Advanced Anti-Colic bottles. How often should I replace the bottle nipples? We recommend changing your bottle nipples every two months. And you should change them immediately if they're damaged or weak. * Based on 2021 study of 524 parents who use Tommee Tippee bottles. ** Made for Mums March 2020",

There is a clear, rubber piece that I have had to fish out of the garbage disposal a few times as it is easy to lose track of in soapy water. I would compare it to the Dr. Brown\u2019s bottles in this regard.However, they are comfortable for me to hold while feeding my daughter and have worked the best for her out of any bottle that we have tried. She has medical complications which have made it challenging for her to eat by mouth since birth, but with this bottle she has been able to consistently take an entire feed without choking or spitting up. They worked much better for us than the Dr. Brown\u2019s.",

                "reviewText": "We bought these on a whim, as I am currently using the standard 5oz. Tommie Tippee bottles for my son and need some more bottles to send with him to daycare. I am exclusively pumping and feeding breastmilk via these bottles. I do have to supplement with formula occasionally. I have used this bottle twice thus far. Before I go into what I dislike, a few nice features are: Heat sensor along the internal 'anti-colic' device and the wide diameter nipple. This is the same nipple as seen in the standard bottle but I really like it as it mimics the breast well.The problem I am having with this bottle is my son suckles hard and the nipple collapses on itself. This frustrates him (and me!). The nipple flow is faster than my '0' nipples and it is apparent when he can suck down 4 oz in no time. For those who are still breastfeeding, and have a slow let-down, this may cause an issue with your child. I was using faster flow nipples initially when I had to start formula and this caused an \"instant gratification\" issue with my babe. He was not happy to wait for my let down at the breast. Additionally, I tried to shake up some formula in the bottle without the colic device in place and it got everywhere. It would be nice if the company offered a cap with this type of bottle.Overall, still happy with the company, but I will probably put these bottles aside until he is older. Coincidentally, the largest \"spit up\" I had with my son I a few weeks was after one of the feedings with this bottle. I certainly don't think it was directly causative and I haven't used the product enough to reliably comment on its 'anti-colic' properties.",
