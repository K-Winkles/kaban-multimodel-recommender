This review aims to provide an overview of the bottles based on their key features and user experiences. One of the standout features of Lansinoh baby bottles is their unique NaturalWave nipple design. This design mimics the natural feeding pattern of breastfeeding, allowing for a smoother and more comfortable transition between breast and bottle. Many parents have found this feature particularly helpful in reducing nipple confusion and ensuring a positive feeding experience. The bottles are also known for their excellent anti-colic properties, with the Air Ventilation System helping to minimize the amount of air that enters the baby's tummy during feeding, thus reducing the risk of discomfort and colic. Furthermore, these bottles are made from high-quality, BPA-free materials, ensuring the safety of the baby with every use. Additionally, Lansinoh bottles are easy to clean and assemble, featuring wide necks for convenient pouring and thorough cleaning. While the majority of users have had positive experiences, a few have reported minor leaking issues. However, overall, Lansinoh baby bottles are a trusted choice for parents seeking a reliable, safe, and efficient feeding solution for their little ones.",

                "reviewText": "I should have bought this bottle long time ago. I have been having a hard time trying to get my baby to transition to breast and bottle feeding. I have literally tried all kinds of brands and silicone and rubber and nothing took with my baby! He is 3 months now and it has been more difficult to get him to take a bottle because I have not been consistent with bottle feeding. I just received this today just in time for his next feeding and boy let me tell you! He was sucking this bottle like he hasn\u2019t ate in days! The nipple is super soft and flexible, and it has that wide base that imitates the breast so their lips flange out perfectly. I now swear by this! Thank you lansinoh for actually making a real bottle for breastfed babies, and thank you Amazon for the quick delivery! Dont buy anything else, try this first!Pro: super soft nipple, slow flow (breastfed babies need a slow flow) holds 5oz (or 6oz if you fill it up to the top)Cons: has a very slight slight leak in the nipple and screw top area , not sure if I boiled it too long and messed up the seal or not.",

He usually used the colic baby bottle that they provided us from the NICU however this set i gotten as a gift from my baby shower. Having a preemie baby on his 2 months mark it's so hard feeding him because he doesn't want to drink but rather sleep. When I tried this for the first time I am so surprised. Literally my little angel always finishes his milk. I have 3 other brands and this replace them all. Now my angel is 5 months and I purchased another set of 3 and he now have 6 bottles in total.Pros: Easy to clean; Soft wide nipples and preemie friendly with the correct nipple; easy assembled and never leak when close.Cons: Soft nipple to the point that you can accidently tear it.",

                "reviewText": "We have had issues feeding our baby from the beginning when she was born nearly 11 lbs and momma was not making enough breastmilk for such a hungry chonker baby. We ended up needing to mix breastfeeding with formula supplementation in order to keep up with baby\u2019s growth and we quickly realized the couple basic bottles we had weren\u2019t going to be enough. Cue frantic product research on what kinds of bottles were best for using alongside breastfeeding and we ended up going on a months long journey trying out several different brands. After our journey I would really encourage people to be very skeptical of bottle company claims of \"breast like\", \"perfect latch\", \"natural feel\" nipple shapes as they don't really need to back that up with any real science. All these poorly shaped bottles plus other factors means our baby has nipple confusion and now hates to be breastfed even though momma is now making plenty of milk to feed baby and it has been a struggle every feeding.After eventually seeing a lactation consultant and having enough time to read some of the lactation books out there we decided to try these bottles since they had a nipple that looked ideal. The wide taper and really soft silicone requires the baby to manipulate the nipple in almost the same way as a breast in order to suck. Baby initially got frustrated with these nipples in exactly the same way as with the breast, which is how we knew we had found the right bottle to help her to breastfeed again. In addition to the nipple shape: the anti colic vent is simple and effective, the bottle is ergonomically curved and easy to hold, paced feeding is easy thanks to good visibility of the milk and taller bottle shape, the cap is removable one handed and doesn't roll away, the bottle fits the lansinoh breast pump which is the best one we tried, and the measuring lines are readable and accurate. The bottle is a pretty standard size and fits nicely in diaper bags, cup holders, sterilizers, and bottle warmers.There are a few shortcomings though that hold this bottle back over its near twin, the Pigeon Nursing bottles. Firstly, the 2S \"slow flow\" nipple flow rate is way too high for infants and early babies. Our baby is 4 months old now and still chokes on the fast flow of these nipples. It might be fine for an older baby, but its a mess to feed baby with so fast a flow. I think Lansinoh assumes you have waited the unrealistic recommendation of 6 months before introducing a bottle and sets the nipple flow accordingly. They also annoyingly don't sell a slower flow. The other more minor gripe I have is that the bottle plastic is pretty thin and lightweight which doesn't seem like it will hold up over a long time.Ultimately these bottles are great, but I still wouldn't choose them because the pigeon bottles exist. They have the same shaped nipple available at slower flow rates, and sturdier bottle materials like borosilicate glass and PPSU. The caps are interchangeable between the bottle brands so you could also just buy a few Pigeon nipples for while the baby is too little to use the faster flow on these bottles.",
