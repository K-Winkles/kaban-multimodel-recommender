                "reviewText": "I bought this brush after seeing it featured in an article on Facebook. I looked at the reviews and everyone seemed to like it so I used the gift card we got for our baby shower to buy it. I am so happy we got this brush, it makes washing our baby\u2019s bottles so much easier. The different attachments are great for cleaning the Dr Brown\u2019s bottles which have lots of parts. I highly recommend this brush. The only downside for me was the holder that attaches to the wall didn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t know if this is because our walls are textured or because the brush was too heavy for the adhesive to support it, but honestly that is a small flaw that doesn\u2019t even matter to me.February 2024 updateWe have had this bottle brush for about 4 months and it has completely died. It says it\u2019s charging but it won\u2019t turn on anymore. I went to use it and it was dead then I plugged it in and let it charge overnight and it still wouldn\u2019t turn on. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and the light turned red like it was charging but it still won\u2019t turn on. I am so disappointed in this product because it only lasted 4 months before it died and I really liked it because it made me washing the bottles so easy.",

                "reviewText": "This brush made my life so much easier! I hand-wash all the bottles and nipples and this brush makes it so much easier and faster. The brush is rechargeable via USB C port. This speaks of a quality because USB C is much better than outdated USB C mini port. I am surprised USB C mini is still showing up on new products, it\u2019s totally outdated. Also, there is a silicone cover protecting the charging port from moisture. Anyways, you press the button and the brush starts spinning. That\u2019s it! Battery life is pretty good, no stress about charging every or every other day, you can relax. Wand comes with 3 size brushes: small, medium, large.Small is AMAZING for narrow Dr. Brown\u2019s nipples. Medium is awesome for wider nipples like Aventi. Large brush is for the bottles. All brushes are made out of silicone making it easy to sterilize. You can toss them in the washer or just in boiling water. I know it seems unnecessary but trust me, if you\u2019re hand-washing the bottles this brush saves a lot of time.I do have a small tip: Disassemble all your bottles first and use small brush to wash all the nipples then use the large brush to wash all the bottles. This was you don\u2019t need to switch attachments several times. Overall build is sturdy and feels durable. I am totally getting this for friends baby showers too, it\u2019s a gem.",

It\u2019s really easy to use, made of silicone for easy sterilization and keeps a charge very well. My only complaint is that one of the attachments is almost impossible to get off once you get it on. The two larger options are easy to get on and off. But the smallest one specifically for cleaning nipples\u2026 is a pain. I have to use a butter knife to get under the bottom of it just to get it to pop off. So now I don\u2019t even use it at all.It would be easier to get off if the silicone part was permanently attached to the plastic that snaps into to the motorized part, but you can pull the silicone right off, so there\u2019s nothing much to grip in order to remove it.If your bottle nipples are wider than the Dr. Browns, you should be able to use the medium attachment just fine. If you use Dr Browns exclusively\u2026 be aware that you won\u2019t be able to scrub the nipples very well.",

The price is amazing especially if you account for all the brushes you won't have to buy because you got this. The best part is the tip is silicone so you can easily wash it between uses and keep it nice and sanitary. This is easy to use just connect the appropriate tip and then push the button and clean the bottle with ease and just holding your hand on the button.",

I bought this for my third baby because nothing is more daunting then washing bottles all the time but this brush made it much more bearable until one day 2 months after I started using it it just stopped spinning. It sounded like the motor was stripped or going out. Also when I was charging it the cord had to be sitting just at the right angle to charge, the port was extremely sensitive.",
