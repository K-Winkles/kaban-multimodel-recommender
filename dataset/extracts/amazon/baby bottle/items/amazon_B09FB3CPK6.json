GrossUpdate:First pic is the first order, I think someone returned their used ones because they weren\u2019t level 0 nipples and no pacifiers and they weren\u2019t individually wrapped. Got replacement sent and they came perfect. Wrapped, level 0, pacifiers and mam papers inside bottles. Great deal and nice customer service on the companies end, emailed them about it.",
