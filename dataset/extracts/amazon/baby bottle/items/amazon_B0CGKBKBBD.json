Our water usage this month determines our next few months water bills. If you know, you know! And we wash/sanitize a LOT of bottles! We went with the 8oz bottle because it will grow with his appetite. Will take 4oz and 8oz liners. He latched to the nipple with no problem (which can be a problem if baby is also BF). You fill them up like normal (yes, I even filled a different bottle first and then poured into bag to make sure measurements were correct with the wrinkled liners) and then I take the end of our bottle brush and shove it into the end of the bottle and push out as much air as I can. When baby is done you toss the liner and wash or wipe the nipple with bottle wipes. Super easy! No leaking at all and the liners are thin but tough. No bags have broken while I was forcefully shoving air out of them. At the end of the day I throw the nipples and nipple rings into a sterilizer bag for 3 minutes and my bottle washing for the day is done. And perfect for travel or a day out if you get the bottle cleaner wipes too. Playtex Baby and Tommee Tippee have made our feeding journey very easy =).",

                "reviewText": "I have used these bottles 7 years ago for my first son and now with my newborn. They are the best. My problem with this order is I received the box and it had no plastic sealed box like it usually does when I buy the liners and the box was bent as if it had been opened. That is concerning considering this is for my newborn son. Feedings are not something you want to take risk with when leaving your baby with a sitter. No one wants their child meal time to be compromised. I took the liners out to check them it looked like all of the 100 weren\u2019t there so I counted each and they definitely were in the box so that was a relief. Typically ordering from Amazon I have no complaints on products or delivery. Overall I recommend the product.",
