                "reviewText": "Dr Brown\u2019s bottles, in general, are great!! Each one, however, is slightly different and overall I prefer the Options, even though my baby is not old enough to use valve-less. I have the original (terrible at spills, because the white cap in the shape of a top hat, sort of, doesn\u2019t stop any liquid at all; they have clear bottles, blue tubies, and whitish valves). I have 4oz blue Options (great, easy parts, thumb print on the lid is awesome for popping that sucker off, and the lid also has these bumps that line up with the nipple, where it slows down the leaking of liquids, and keeps the leak in the cap, although given the ease of taking the cap off, it can still get really messy). (Sorry for the run on sentences, I\u2019m a sleep deprived mama!!) I have the 4oz pink Options (similar to the blue, but actually the valve fits very snuggly along with the tubey part into the bottle, so that can be handy when trying to put the bottle together or add formula, while also holding a baby - more stable than any of the other bottles, where the tubey/valve pieces are just loose kind of sitting on top of the bottle; similar cap as the blue, but no thumb print, and harder to get the cap off, especially one handed). Lastly, I have the 8oz Options with plain bottles and with the Dream/Adventure and Animal characters, all with the green valves and tubies, and the similar cap to the blue, except they are clear, thumbprint included! These have been great, and the animal characters are super cute; the \u2018dream big\u2019 and \u2018adventure awaits\u2019 are cute-meh. The only thing I was disappointed in that set, is that half the bottles had characters, and half were plain. I may be off on the count, because I bought two sets, but I remember being bummed that I paid a premium for cuteness, and didn\u2019t get a full set of cuteness! I do not own, but have used some purple wide bottles that I was loaned while traveling. That was great, so I wouldn\u2019t have to carry a bunch of bottles, but I wouldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t buy them; they\u2019re just too wide for my taste, harder to handle, especially one handed, and I didn\u2019t feel the wide nipple was significantly better for my baby girl. I will address two of the main two complaints I\u2019ve seen about Dr. Brown\u2019s: leaking and too many parts to clean! Leaking, yes, totally a thing, but it does in fact say on the bottle to only fill to X line to avoid leaking! Having said that, it is very hard for my brain to perfectly calculate how much water I need for the formula, where I don\u2019t end up exceeding the volume specified on ghe bottle! I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge issue. I know it\u2019s going to or probably will, leak, given the liquid in the bottle, and what I do is to keep a cloth or bib under the bottle when she first starts drinking, and after the liquid is down a bit, I just open the bottle up and pull the valve/tubey piece up a bit, and several big drops come flying down the side of the bottle, which I just wipe off with the same bib/cloth. I can immediately get the bottle put back together before my daughter complains too terribly much. Remember, this is only an issue when you\u2019re filling the entire bottle, either 4oz or 8, so at that point the baby is a bit older and can hopefully handle the briefest of pauses without too much of an issue. If my daughter were the type to go full on nuclear melt down, I think I would probably have to be more diligent about staying under the line, and offering more milk, once the bottle\u2019s finished, and a fuller belly is less likely to melt down. Ok, regarding too many parts to clean... there\u2019s what? Two extra parts that other bottles don\u2019t have? Meh. But I will totally recommend getting the Dr Brown\u2019s dishwasher baskets!!! Oh. Dude. Awesome sauce, life-saving, yes. I am very green, sustainable oreinted, so I cringe at how much water I\u2019m consuming running the dishwasher sometimes every day. So not cool. And, I\u2019m also a sole parent, so I gots a lot to take care of, dishwashy basket is a must!! I have 4. : 0 ) I\u2019m not a super fan of washing the nipples in the dishwasher, so I still do those by hand, no biggy. There\u2019s even special baskets for just nipples; someone gave them to me, but no, I no likey since it looks like there\u2019s still a film on the inside.My experience with Dr Brown\u2019s bottles in general, has been awesome! I don\u2019t even remember when I sorta stopped burping my baby (she\u2019s six months now), it just happened organically over time, but when I was burping her (maybe for three months?), she would only have one, maybe two burps. She burps on her own now, but then maybe that\u2019s just her, the point is that there was very little gas! She had a wee bit of reflux as a newborn, but that\u2019s normal I think, what with having an immature gut as a tadpole-baby. I gave her probiotics and kept her upright-ish, and I think the bottles helped. Ultimately, I totally recommend them!! They were recommended to me by my sister, 8 years ago, as my nephew\u2019s salvation, hope they work for you!",

                "reviewText": "We had a premie and these are the perfect size bottles to start with for the first month or two of babies life. Baby does not need to be a premie for these bottles to work. We loved the size of them! They worked wonders to help reduce air from entering (reducing gas), easy to clean, holds 4oz and is easy to travel with.They are light weight and easy to hold while feeding.The one con we did have for this bottle is that if it\u2019s not put together or sealed properly it tends to leak. We also learned the hard way as first time parents that the white flat caps are to be placed between the filter (green) and the cap/nipple to prevent leaking while traveling. Do not throw the white caps away they are to be used to prevent leaking bottles!All in all this is a great set of bottles by a great brand. We recommend this bottle set to first time parents. We also should kindly remind parents that not all kiddos like this style bottle. Our baby did and that is why we bought them! This brand was also recommended by our provider.Please remember that this is a review and contains opinions. You may have a different opinion and that is okay. I hope this can help someone!",

                "reviewText": "I have a one month old preemie baby (born 34wks; was in NICU for being an immature feeder) When it was time for her to use a regular bottle vs hospital bottle we started with the MAM bottles and she took to it pretty well but milk did leak out of the base of the nipple and she seemed to get so gassy after her feedings. I got quite a few of these Dr Browns bottles in a variety of baby sample boxes so we decided to give it a try and my little one immediately took to the these bottles (narrow flow 1 nipples come with these bottles). It does appear to help with her burps and gassiness compared to the MAM bottled we used previously and there was no confusion for her making the switch from a wide base nipple to a more narrow base nipple. So far we love these but hate all the different parts that must be washed! That is the only downside!",

                "reviewText": "My 3 month old seas not gaining weight, seemed like she was having trouble eating 24/7 with other name brand bottles I was using. She could never drink more than 2 oz max, most of the time only drinking 1/2 an ounce to an ounce. I went to a PT/OT feeding specialist and they found she had multiple oral ties, high palate and oro motor issues. They recommended we use the dr brown barrow bottles with level 2 nipple. Within 24 hrs of her using these bottles she was able to start drinking 4 ounces at a time. I never thought that would be possible. We still have a long way to go but I\u2019m super thankful for Dr browns bottles. They are a bit leaky but once you get the hang of it it\u2019s not bad at all. Thank you for making a wonderful product that makes it easier on my baby to eat. I will forever only use and recommend this brand from now on.",

My son had tongue tie and due to excessive air intake he had so much colic and crying all day long. With the brown bottle of course as well as medications and other things he improved significantly. But u could clearly see the difference when he took a regular bottle and when he took the Dr. Brown\u2019s bottles. I guess the pain of cleaning them is just a small price to pay for my baby being better. To note i hate them for travelling if they contain milk and only if they are tilted they do leak inside the cover so when u open the cover the milk comes out. if they could do just a small screw cover like the medella or tommy tippe that would save so much trouble. On the travel i just put the milk into a medella or a small avent bottle and when my baby wants to eat i transfer it to to the Dr. Brown. They are so long that they are half the length of my baby which looks awkward but all these are secondary things if u compare it to the positive outcomes. So yes i do recommend.",
