                "reviewText": "My daughter has used Dr.Brown since birth (she\u2019s 5 months now). When we switched her to formula we had to use Nutramigen WITH OATMEAL to help her stop spitting up. Because of the thicker consistency it made cleaning the Dr.B bottles even harder then it already was. You can take all tubes out but then you have nothing to reduce air. These resemble the Dr. B nipples, reduces the air intake AND extremely easy to clean. Are the numbers harder to see? Sure but it\u2019s a minor inconvenience.THE 10oz. BOTTLES COME WITH FASTER FLOW NIPPLES. If your looking to buy for a newborn you should either buy the 4oz bottles or the slow flow nipples.***ADDING OATMEAL WAS INSTRUCTED BY OUR PEDIATRICIAN AND SHOULDN\u2019T BE DONE OTHERWISE***",

                "reviewText": "Happy with my purchase. Was hesitant at first and was pondering on buying the more popular brand. Glad I went with this set. My 8month old needed to upgrade to bigger bottles & she previously used Dr Brown. Her transition was a breeze! The flow was just right and did not leak like the Dr Browns did. Had I went with the other brands, I\u2019m sure I would have to buy new nipples that\u2019s more suitable for my older baby. Best of all, the nipple for Dr Brown also fit on the Avima 10oz tall bottles and I no longer have to deal with washing all those annoying parts. Reasonably priced and highly recommended",

I bought them for ease of traveling and now use them everyday! It cuts cleaning in half and bottles don\u2019t leak in the baby bag. The nipples do collapse sometimes but doesn\u2019t seem to affect her eating. I highly recommend but not for newborns",

                "reviewText": "I would probably return them if they weren\u2019t bottles. I\u2019m giving a 4 star because 3 seems too harsh. It\u2019s a good quality bottle and nipple. The main issue is the bottle is for 10 oz but the fill line is too close to the top. When I try to put the formula in it doesn\u2019t fit. You have to put 2 scoops in then shake then put in the rest. The hole could also be wider so it\u2019s easier to put the formula in. I\u2019m trying to find a 10 oz formula because my boy gets really hungry for night time feeds. Since I only have to use these bottles once a day it\u2019s not too bad. Oh and great price too for the quality if those cons don\u2019t apply to you",
