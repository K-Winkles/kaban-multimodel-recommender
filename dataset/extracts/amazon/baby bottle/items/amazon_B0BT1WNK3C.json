These bottles are relatively straightforward to clean and function as anticipated. However, they have a notably soft construction, and the nipple size seemed a bit on the smaller side for our 8-month-old baby. It's worth noting that these bottles might be more suitable for younger infants, given the softness and nipple size. While they didn't quite meet our needs for an older baby, they still served their purpose and were functional. Overall, they might be a good choice for those with younger infants.",

                "reviewText": "These will probably take some practice to figure out which types of food to use with these. Applesauce might work well with the bigger nipple if it's thinner. Baby food should work, but if you are trying baby led weaning you're probably not using baby food or purees.These bottles are super squishy. That makes them easy to hold, but they do squish more as baby sucks on them so it may be difficult to get all of the food when eating.I think the larger nipple might actually work well with a toddler who's learning to use a cup. They aren't spill proof though.The smaller nipple would work better with liquid than food.",

                "reviewText": "Many people are confused on what these are for, just read the other reviews, and the product description isn't really much help. These are squeeze bottles. They are meant to be used with a thicker consistency: baby cereal, baby purees, baby smoothies. They really aren't meant for infants. They honestly could be dangerous for them due to the flow rate. They have two nipples a criss cross and a circle, the latter has a higher flow rate. They are soft enough to squeeze to increase flow. These are similar to the yogurt/apples sauce pouches but they are reusable and made from silicone.",
