                "reviewText": "Tommee Tippee is amazing. I have never been disappointed with any of their bottles. They are high quality and last a really long time. I saved ones from my four year and they still all have the markings on them. These ones are perfect for the first few months where they don't take too much at a feeding. For EBF Moms this was the first bottle my daughter took from Daddy at two weeks old and we never looked back. For formula feeding moms this bottle is easy to fill and scoop because of the wide opening. The nipples are durable. The price is always great for a higher end bottle and you will not be disappointed. If something is wrong with the nipple either make sure it is only hand washed or make sure you a re pinching the valve first...otherwise it is probably defective. Also they sell these bottles everywhere so if you ever run out you will have no problem finding them.Edit: So after using these for 3 weeks with my newborn I can safely say I will not be using these for awhile Not sure why but these and the Avent Naturals are the only bottles that my baby consistently chokes on. They are slow flow so I'm not sure why but she does really well with the Dr. Browns the Playtex and The Nuk. Moral of the story, not every baby will take well to every bottle so don't buy tons of one brand like I did.",

                "reviewText": "Since my daughter was born, we have tried numerous brands of bottles. We started off with the Nuk brand since they seemed to have great reviews. However, she absolutely drowned and choked every time she used it. We then got the slowest flow nipples by Nuk and it was still too much for her and caused her to still choke on her milk and have terrible gas pains. We went on to a few other brands with the same issue of choking or eating way too fast (under 3 minutes) which defeats the point of pacefeeding since I am also breastfeeding. So, we decided to use Tommee Tippee extra slow flow (0) and she no longer chokes or has gas pains. Now, keep in mind that it's called Slow Flow for a reason. My husband got impatient that each feeding takes her about 15-20 minutes, depending on how sleepy she is, but I'd take that over her discomfort any day. My biggest gripe about these bottles are the space in between the bottle cap and the bottle itself. Even when twisted tightly shut, there is a gap large enough for my 5-week-old to curl her fingertips into. I had a scare the other day when she managed to get the tip of her pinky stuck but luckily I noticed before I pulled the bottle away. I could've hurt her otherwise.Pros:- No more choking on milk- Prevents gas pain- Baby is comfortable and not fussy when eating- Easy to hold- Great for breastfeeding mamas who are pace feedingCons:- Gap large enough for baby's fingertips to slide into- A little difficult to clean with all the curvatures- Nipple sometimes gets clogged and needs to be squeezed in order to create a smooth flow again- Feedings take on average 17 minutes",
