                "reviewText": "My daughter definitely uses this product when we are out and about, especially at my son's basketball games. It has come in very handy when I have forgotten her sippy cup. She has squirted it out on herself once but that was because my sister was trying to take it from her and she bit down on the top and it pulled off the bottle and got her soaked. But the product works as described and is very useful if you have a little one (my daughter is 13 months).",

My 18 month old can use these easily and it doesn't leak as long as it's not squeezed upside down. Definitely great to keep in the car for 'mommy forgot the sippy cup brain.' In the video I'm using a flimsy water bottle from Harris Teeter and I've also tried Walmart and Nestle and it's been a good fit. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I love the convenience and portability of these spill proof caps/spouts. I keep both of them stored in the box that was included and leave it in my diaper bag. My 2 kids (both 1 and 3) have their own water bottles with a flip top straw that I usually bring whenever we go out. Sometimes we have WAY too many things to carry and will only bring one bottle if I know it's a short trip. There are times when I forget all together and will just give them water from the bottles (due to lack of straws available) which results in spillage at times. Now I don't have to worry about anything if I forget their water bottles or they run out. These spouts fit easily and tightly onto aby water standard water bottle. They stay in place, have a nice little loop to hold onto, and also has a flip top cover to prevent germs/spillage. I like that it comes with 2 different colors so I can distinguish which one belongs to which child.",
