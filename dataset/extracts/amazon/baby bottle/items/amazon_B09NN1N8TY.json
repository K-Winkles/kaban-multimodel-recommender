            "EASY TO CLEAN: We designed these bottles for babies to be a joy to use, even for parents. They are easy to clean because you can fully detach every part, from the cover to the squeezable milk container. They are dishwasher safe for simple and sterile cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter was exclusively breastfed until she was 6 months old, then I went back to work and she had to take a bottle. We tried a different brand first but she didn\u2019t do great with it. At around 7 months we tried this one and she took to it so much better!I love that it\u2019s silicone, it\u2019s very lightweight, the large opening makes it very easy to clean, and all around we just love this bottle. We got the medium flow nipple and that\u2019s what she still uses at 9 months, and it works great for her.",
