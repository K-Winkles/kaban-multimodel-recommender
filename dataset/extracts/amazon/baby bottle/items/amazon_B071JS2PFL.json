We were already using the Dr. Brown bottles so we purchased these to help him learn how to drink water. Since they fit onto the bottles we already have my son recognizes his bottles and wants to drink with these. They are also much easier for my son to drink with than traditional sippy cups. For right now they work great and we will try to transition him to sippy cups again when he's a little older. The only problem I have had is with the smaller 4 ounce bottles they sometimes leak but the larger bottles don't seem to have this problem. The small bottle leaks are not enough for me to be bothered by it.",

I love my Dr Brown bottles and was very excited to extend their life a little further with my toddlers.My only bit of feedback is the durability of the nipple. At the age kids are using this, they bite, a lot. No pieces have broke off, which is great! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a safety issue (or hasn\u2019t been for me) but they do leak after a bit (usually less than a month, with daily use for me).",

We use it without the venting straw, but air bubble escape just fine, might need to let baby release his mouth a bit after a long sip every 2 oz or so, but it is a good practice for him to get ready to use sippy cup or straws.I like how the shape is flat, it give baby the cue that this is something different than normal milk (which we are still feeding - a meal of thicker liquid, a meal of regular milk), he knows it's different and he pays more attention to it when sipping and swallowing the thicker puree.",
