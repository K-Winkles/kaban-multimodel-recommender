The slope of the nipple is such an easy adjustment and transition for her because of the natural shape. I brought these along with two other mainstream brands of bottles with me to a lactation appointment and the specialist was very surprised and please when I showed her these bottles. She said the size and length of the nipple is great and encouraged me to continue using them! I do wish there was a single bottle option to purchase though.",

I have ordered a few different types of bottles to see what he likes. He hasn't \"picked\" his favorite yet and still seems to just be getting used to the idea of taking milk from something that isn't directly his mama, but I personally think these have one of the better designs I have seen. I suspect that once he gets the hang of it he will really like these. The shape of the nipple is very natural, and it is comfortable for me to hold while feeding him. They are easy to clean and seem to be well constructed. The price is a little high, but I think they are comparable to other quality breastfeeding-friendly bottles. If you are shopping around to find what your breastfed baby will like, I think these could be a good option.",

I love that these are slow flow, and the anti colic holes are a great design which makes these easier to clean vs the other styles. The cap is another feature I like for travel and helping to prevent leaks.",
