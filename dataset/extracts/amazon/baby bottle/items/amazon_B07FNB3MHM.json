Not only did my son latch so easy to them but he loves them! My nipple is so big for his tiny mouth that with these bottles he\u2019s able to eat comfortably. He\u2019s 10 days old so we have him on size nipple 0 and it\u2019s amazing. No leaks, easy to clean, and easy to sterilize. We also got him the MAM pacifier and it\u2019s the best. I really really recommend these bottles. They work amazingly in mimicking mom\u2019s nipple.",

These bottles are loved by my baby as well as have many parent approved qualities. They are easy to clean (with a built in ability to sanitize). The vent function works to help prevent air within the bottle. You will still need to make sure that the milk is going into the nipple. Overall, the bottles are aesthetic as well as come in all of the variety you need to not purchase an abundance of bottling supplies.The only downfalls (if you will) are that the bottles do not heat well in a bottle warmer due to the thicker plastic base. You are not able to see the one ounce mark on the bottle itself, the included cap however is beneficial here.",
