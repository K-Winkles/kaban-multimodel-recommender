                "reviewText": "I have twins bottle fed on formula. I was looking for a leak proof less-mess bottle and yes this bottle and nipple really don\u2019t leak. But ironically the bottle feeding just got WAY messier as the babies (6 months old) dribble milk from their mouths and soak their bibs/clothes, they choke and spit milk out, they play with nipple chew in it and milk just oozes out their mouth. So unfortunately this will not work as it\u2019s so messy!! Maybe other babies can handle this variable flow nipple better.I also was annoyed with not being able to read the ounces on bottle. Cleaning was easy. Honest review.",

These nuby leak proof are literally the only bottle I've ever found that don't leak AT ALL. Until the nipple splits due to little one gnawing on it. Annoying but still worth the dry sheets, dry face and clothes you have until that point. Added bonus- I've found them at CVS before for literally 57 cents.",
