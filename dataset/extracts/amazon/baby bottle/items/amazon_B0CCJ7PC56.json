            "It is essential to ensure the safety of breast milk: the bottle body is made of food-grade borosilicate glass. While ensuring that it can be refrigerated, heated and stored at normal temperature, it does not contain any harmful substances, and there will be no plastic smell seeping into the baby's milk (the penetration of harmful substances will lead to plastic smell). There is no need to worry about the safety of breast milk. All parts can be disassembled for cleaning.",
            "Three-in-one wide-necked glass bottle is used for pumping, storing and feeding: the bottle is suitable for the Breast Pumps & Nipples, so mothers can pump, store and feed with the same glass bottle to reduce the transfer of breast milk and save precious breast milk.",
            "100% leak proof and 10 ml fine measurement mark: silicone sealing disc is used, so there is no need to worry about leakage; The bottle has a 10 ml increment measurement mark. You know how much milk you produce. The ballpoint pen can be written on sealing disk to mark important matters. The mark can be erased and marked circularly.",
            "It can ensure the safety of infants and young children: The bottle has a strong resistance to falling. When used, it can not only guarantee the use time limit of the bottle, but also avoid the safety hazards brought to infants due to broken glass. Glass bottles are not only healthier for infants, but also easier to clean than plastic bottles, because glass bottles are unlikely to leave residue and odor scratches.",
            "Our commitment: be ready to become a fanatic. As parents, we know how important it is to only use the best products for our children, so all of our products have a problem-free refund policy. If you are not happy, neither are we. Just contact us and we will provide you with VIP services."

For that reason (in addition to the stellar quality of materials) I have increased my rating to 4 stars.",

Unfortunately the description is wrong from what I\u2019ve experienced in terms of nipple compatibility. They do not fit the evenflo balance + standard nipples. They DO fit the wide neck nipples. I ordered the standard nipples trusting this description and was very sad when I got them and found that they did not fit. I already had the wide neck ones from bottles I already had so we found a solution but I spent $16 on nipples I will not use.If you also plan on using these as more than just milk collection/storage make sure you get the correct size nipple. They are great otherwise and I would definitely recommend them.",

Once we figured out what was going on we just made sure to have a paper towel every time we used them. It was just a little annoying is all",
