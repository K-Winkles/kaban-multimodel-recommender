They\u2019re a life saver no more putting together 100 parts on a stupid leak free cups that always seem to mold or get gross. These are easy to wash (dishwasher safe) easy to install they don\u2019t leak they\u2019re hard to pull off so you don\u2019t have to worry about your little ones yanking it off. My kids are even obsessed with these things they finally feel like mom with their own water bottles and they enjoy fidgeting with the funky handles. For my little littles putting the cap on and off is great for their mobility and concentration skills. These things are a 10/10 I ordered more and I tell all my mom friends who then immediately order them as well. They\u2019re also a huge help when traveling we just bring these and don\u2019t even worry about cups anymore. My mom even thinks they\u2019re the coolest things ever and wishes they would\u2019ve made these when we were kids 25+ years ago. Don\u2019t hesitate just buy them you won\u2019t regret it!",
