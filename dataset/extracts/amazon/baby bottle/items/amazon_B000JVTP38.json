Sometimes we couldn\u2019t even shake the bottles to mix the formula because it was making a mess. But these bottles are amazing!!! They truly are leak proof and my babies are teething right now so the nipples on these are perfect! The only thing that I don\u2019t like is how dark the red one is. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see how much water I put in the bottle. But overall these are my favorite brand of bottles. Will be buying more",

The flow is very low, and low to the point where my baby collapses the nipple when trying to suck the formula out causing her to be fussy. The price is great for this many bottles I\u2019ll give them that. And the ease to clean the nipples has never been easier, I just think the flow could have been better, so I wasn\u2019t able to use these very long for my baby. I had to spend money on new ones.

I decided to order some from Amazon and these look somewhat different. I'm going to try the ones I bought from Amazon and give the bottles another chance. The Amazon bottles look different and the nipples are a little different. I'm hoping they work because the Tommee Tippee bottles leak so much they make a mess. Will try them tomorrow morning when my granddaughter gets here. (I baby sit her while my daughter works).",
