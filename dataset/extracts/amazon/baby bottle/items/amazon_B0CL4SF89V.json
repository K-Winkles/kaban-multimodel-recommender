This is a great way to recycle those expensive bottles as baby gets older.The price, I find to be not much better than getting new bottles nipples from the store, with these coming out to almost $6 per soppy cup kit.The product itself: it fits perfectly! While it comes with the weighted straw, we actually aren't using that part yet. The spout does work just fine by itself for us. The straw did seem to work okay, but she kept trying to tilt the cup like she does bottles. In time I'll start putting that back on when she gets cups of water (with the straw being so thin, I'm going to avoid milk/ formula with it)Overall, this was a great find that will give our expensive bottles even more use!",

I purchased this conversion kit so that she can continue using the Advent bottles and it has been amazing! The handles are great at helping her learn to tilt her bottles up to drink. The sippy conversion is exactly what she needed and is now using it to learn how to use a sippy. It's easy to clean and works well with no leaks. This kit also allows me to use her already purchased bottles instead of having to throw them away and by a bunch of sippy cups. This is a must have for any parent and I will definitely be purchasing more.",

The lids and spouts fit perfectly, and work great on this brand too! My toddler likes to tip his cups to drink so I like weighted straws for his water. I wouldn't recommend putting anything but water in weighted straw cups since they are so difficult to clean. These will extend the life of your bottles, and are easy for babies/toddlers to learn to use too.",

                "reviewText": "We are using Philips Avent Natural flow bottles for our 7 m.o daughter as as she is just beginning to hold objects and self feed, we wanted to buy a sipper for her to learn . Just then we came across this conversion kit that would convert these bottles with handles as well as a sippy cup for self feeding. Naturally we were excited to try this instead buying a new sippy cup mainly because our daughter is already very familiar with the Avent bottles and knows how to use them , so the transition to learning self feeding and using it as a sippy cup for water would be much quicker and easier .QUALITY- The overall quality of the conversion kit is very good : from the plastic handles , body and the silicone spout , all feel of very good OEM-like qualityFIT - All the parts of the conversion kit fitted our 8Oz Avent bottle perfectly, from the handles and the sippy cup attachment/spout- There were no leaks in after either just just the handles with the original Avent nipple or the sippy cup conversion spoutUSING IT/LIKES- Our daughter got used to the handles and the sippy cup modification very quickly. In fact , at first she was very curious about it because it was something new on our regular feeding bottle and I think that played a large part in her learning to use it and self feed so quickly- The weighted straw means that baby is taking in more of her milk water all the time rather than air , no matter what position they are holding the bottle in .- The cleaning brushes were a nice little addition as wellDISLIKES- The only minor dislike I can think of is that they do not come with a cap for the sippy cup spout in the pack . Now granted that the OEM Avent caps fit on these just fine but then you would have to leave the main nipple exposed . Having its own caps would have been much better for hygiene and traveling purposesFINAL THOUGHTSOverall this is a very nice conversion set that will not only eliminate the need for you to get another sippy cup while your child grows, but also help in learning self feeding much faster because they are already used to the OEM Philips bottle and will adapt faster.",

                "reviewText": "First off I over all love this! It first both my plastic and glass Avent natural bottles. I like that it can be used with or without the handles and I absolutely love that the tubing can be completely disassembled to fully clean. Now I would not recommend these for babies transitioning from a bottle as the spout flow is pretty quick and it does leak a bit if left upside down. Honestly the only thing I would change if I could change anything is the shape of the spout. I wish it were an actual straw shape and not the sippy cup shape but that\u2019s my preference for my child\u2019s oral development. But to have on hand as an easy extra cup option I love these and again my favorite part is how easy they are to clean! There is also quite a bit of length to the tubing so you could always trim that to fit your bottles better, for instance it\u2019s entirely too long for the four ounce bottles but you can cut it to size without issue. Five stars from me for sure.",

The weighted straw works well and the nipples can be used with or without them and they come with their own cleaning brushes to make cleaning the straws easy. 10/10",
