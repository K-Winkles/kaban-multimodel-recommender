I use these little bottles for everything: pumping, storage, transport, pre-portioning formula for on the go, mess-free mixing with the lid on. They just happen to fit perfectly into the insulated lunch bags I have. It\u2019s so incredibly practical to be able to just pop a nipple straight onto these rather than always having to transfer the liquid into a separate bottle to feed.BUT I wish the silicone the nipples are made of were sturdier! I keep having to check if the walls of the nipple are sticking together, not letting any milk through, or if the nipple has completely inverted. Very annoying. I also wish the nipples were sold separately. Overall great satisfaction with this brand though.",

                "reviewText": "My baby girl who was EBF started daycare at 4 months NOT taking bottles. My silly self gave her a bottle once at 3-4 weeks and she took it no problem. I then thought to myself that she wouldn't have an issue taking them and didn't feed her from bottle again until about 3 months. WELL SHE DIDNT LIKE ANY of them!!!! Daycare had to syringe feed her for about 2 weeks!! I had bought about 5 bottles she did not like ANY and would CRY as soon as it touched her lips. Most of them were a harder material. These ones are nice and soft, more so than what I have tried and she took these ones easily said daycare!!! These were actually suggested by daycare as a last ditch option before just cup feeding her!!!! TRY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",
