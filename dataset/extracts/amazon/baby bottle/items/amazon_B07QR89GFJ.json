I've noticed with the wide mouth bottles, they tend to leak of the round air flow system isn't perfectly flush with the actual bottle- even when it's underfilled (not filled to the max line). cleaning could be easier- I had found some left over milk residue on the (again) round air flow system hiding in the crevices. but overall, I would not change my bottles preference. I do appreciate the different sizes that these bottles come in (skinny 4oz & 8oz, wide 5oz & 9oz). My son has larger lips and I find that he has a better time latching to the wide mouth nipples versus the skinny nips.",
