I use them with pigeon nipples and it\u2019s perfect. If you want a glass option without the weight these are great. I drop them all the time and my baby has started to throw them and no issues",

They are lightweight and easy to use. There are no extra parts to clean. I have dropped them a couple of times, but none have broken. The nipples do occasionally collapse if she sucks too hard, but they open right back up when we take them from her mouth.",

                "reviewText": "Our daughter has had zero issues with these bottles. She had no troubles adjusting to the nipple shape/flow (she was breast fed and later combo fed). The wider base at the bottom helped her hold it independently without it slipping from her grip. We also have the shorter 6 oz bottles and love those as well.Only complaint is you have to make sure you have a nice wide bottle brush and that you really make sure you scrub the bottom of the bottle well. Because of the shape of the bottle at the base, it can be easy to miss something and then they're not fully clean. Once I noticed this I just purchased a different bottle brush and it solved the problem but definitely something to be aware of.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Only good for 6 months before crack - poor customer service",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE: From 5 stars, to 3 stars, to 1 star. I contacted Chicco regarding the issue with 6 of the 12 bottles i purchased cracking down the measurement line. Their customer service was abysmal and they wanted evidence of every purchase I made, my personal information, and photos of every bottle I included in my complaint. Of course we'd already thrown out a few but I sent them what they requested otherwise to show my concerns were legitimate. Customer service was in no way accommodating or apologetic and I felt like they were more resistant and suspicious than anything. I'll not be risking my child's safety with a company I feel invalidates my concerns as a parent.UPDATE: After about 7 months of use we just noticed that vertically, directly along the measurement line at least half of the bottles have cracked. If you gently squeeze you can see the liquid run out of that line. There was a video uploaded on here by someone else that shows it. I wish the care instructions stated to replace the bottles every six months so I wouldn't have to worry that my baby drank some glass. I edited my review from 5 stars to 3 stars because we have loved these bottles immensely, but the claim that they won't crack or break is untrue and the care instructions should absolutely state they need to be replaced every 6 months if this has happened to multiple people. We did put these in a sterilizer a lot over their lifespan which I'm sure expedited the breakdown, but since every bottle that is compromised is directly down the measurement line, I'd say there is a design flaw and that when they add the measurement line it corrupts the integrity of the product. My baby loves these nipples and is fighting us on the change so I'm not sure if we will repurchase this product or not. I'm apprehensive to say the least.Original:Super great bottles. Love the glass inside, plastic outside combo. Our baby is not colicky but if you hold these with the Chico symbol on the nipple upwards they are supposed to help with that. We bought a bunch. Our baby loves these too.",
