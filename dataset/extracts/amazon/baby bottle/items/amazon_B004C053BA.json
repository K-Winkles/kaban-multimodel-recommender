                "reviewText": "This is an amazing bottle. SO perfect. My son is tongue tied and can not latch very good on a bottle or breast. Due to this I have stuck to breastfeeding but it is a fight at every feed. Now I am going back to work but no bottle worked on him. I tried everything as I had left over bottles from my 2 year old. Then a friend who had the same issues let me try a COMO TOMO bottle. It took him less than 30 seconds to latch on and he normally takes 1-2 minutes just to latch onto the breast. I was amazed. What makes his latching even harder is his tongue tie, he can't extend his tongue and this bottle nipple is shorter so it helps him. I have looked high and low for a shorter nipple, this bottle does the trick. It should be called boobttle. They only bad thing is it is pricey and you can only get it online at Amazon. I can't wait until it is sold in a bigger store or somewhere like Buy Buy Baby or Baby Hugs. This bottle never leaked for me and it was easy to put together. (Tommee Tippee and Advent Leaked for me) It was hard to read the volume but when turned to the light you can see it. The smaller bottle comes with a nipple that is 0-3 months so you will need to purchase more nipples once the baby is bigger. But the next bottle size does come with a nipple for 3-6 months. This was not explained on Amazon or on the bottle itself. It would be nice to know what size the nipples are with a label or explaination on the packageing.Pros:* My baby loves it.* Easy to hold for baby and parent* Soft like a breast* Easy to clean* Easy to put together* No leaks* Cool looking* Shorter Nipple* Option to get more nipples in slower or faster flowCons:* Pricey* Not in Stores (so you have to wait for it to ship)* Hard to read volume* Wish they had more neutral ring colors (but green is good)",

                "reviewText": "I have absolutely zero complaints about these bottles. I did a ton of research on bottles when I had my firstborn and decided on these. I have no regrets. They are dishwasher, boil, and microwave safe. The anticolic vents work well and ythe bottle itself is flexible silicone so if the vents are blocked the bottle decompresses to prevent negative pressure build up associated with bellyaches. The nipple shape is highly recommended for all babies and mimics the actual breast for babies that nurse as well. Additionally, there are all kids of accessories you can buy to use your bottles even longer (I.e. flat covers in place of for snack storage, nipple flow varieties of slow, medium, and fast, sippy cup nipples, and straws). I\u2019ve used the same set for two babies, and they still look brand new.",

                "reviewText": "Nipple confusion is a big worry for many parents. For breastfeeding moms who want some freedom from feeding every three to four hours or having to pump at work, the wide, soft mound design of the Comotomo bottles makes for an easy transition. Cleaning is also simple, thanks to the wide neck that accommodates a dish sponge and BPA-free material that makes the bottles dishwasher safe.Pros\u2022 Wide nipple mound for easy latching\u2022 Wide neck makes it easy to hand-wash\u2022 BPA- and phthalate-free, 100 percent medical-grade silicone is safe to boil, put in dishwasher or microwaveCons\u2022 Hard to read measurement markings\u2022 Tips over easily\u2022 Nipple color turns cloudy over timeBottom LineThe soft, silicone material and wide, naturally shaped design of the Comotomo bottles helps prevent nipple confusion, making it easier to switch between bottle and breastfeeding.FeaturesIt\u2019s common for breastfeeding moms to worry about whether baby is getting enough milk and gaining the recommended amount of weight, so finding a bottle that makes feeding simpler is key to easing anxiety. With my first son, I alternated between Philips Avent and Comotomo bottles and had no major problems. But when I tried introducing a Philips bottle to my daughter, Athena, when she was around 3 months old\u2014to give myself a little freedom (she eats five times a day and still wakes up for a nightly feeding!)\u2014she had a hard time latching on to the bottle\u2019s smaller mound. So I tried the Comotomo bottle, and after taking a little time to get used to it, she was able to latch on and successfully release the milk.I think the Comotomo\u2019s wide, soft mound and pliable nipple makes it easier for babies to transition from breast to bottle, since it more closely mimics a natural breast than most other bottles on the market. It also helps that the bottle is made of the same soft silicone material as the nipple, so her little hands can easily squeeze and hold onto it, just like she\u2019s used to doing with my breast.At first, I was nervous that Athena might reject the breast if she started feeding from a bottle, but she\u2019s been going back and forth pretty easily for about two months now with no issues. Still, as a precaution that my pediatrician recommended, I always angle her in more of a seated position for bottle-feeding so that the milk doesn\u2019t come out too easily. I wouldn\u2019t want her to start thinking that the breast is too much work by comparison.The Comotomo bottle comes with a slow-flow nipple for 0 to 3 months, but you can buy replacement nipples in slow, medium (3 to 6 months), fast (6+ months) and variable (6+ months) flow. The flow size isn\u2019t labeled on the nipple itself, but the nipple hole changes depending on the size so once you open the package and start using them you\u2019ll have to remember which is which\u2014slow flow has one hole, medium has two holes, fast has three and variable has a Y-cut.Like the mound, the neck is also designed wider than other bottles, which makes it really easy to clean. No need to use a bottle brush\u2014you can just reach in with a regular dish sponge. And since the bottles are free of BPA, phthalates and PVC, and made with medical-grade silicone, I can boil them and put them in the top rack of the dishwasher without worrying about them releasing any icky chemicals.PerformanceI have the green Comotomo bottles in both the 5- and 8-ounce sizes, and they\u2019ve held up well, especially since I already used them with my son 18 months ago. The screw top is pretty leak proof, so you can toss it into a diaper bag and not worry about spills. I did have an issue with one of the tops on the bottle being screwed on so tightly that I couldn\u2019t get it off (I blame my husband for that one!) and we had to throw it away. Otherwise, we\u2019ve had no issues with the quality other than occasionally noticing a very subtle soap smell inside the bottle after washing. The Comotomo website says that may happen; they recommend sterilizing the bottles in boiling water for five minutes with a tiny bit of baking soda and then letting them air-dry (open side up) in a well-ventilated area.There are also anti-colic vents on the side of the nipple designed to help baby suck in less air, resulting in less gas, indigestion and spit-up. I can\u2019t say I really noticed a difference when my son switched between bottle brands, but my daughter seems to have the same amount of burps and gas whether she breastfeeds or uses the Comotomo bottles, so I\u2019m going to assume it works.One other thing I noticed is that over time the nipple changes from clear to cloudy with repeated washings. The good thing is it doesn\u2019t affect the performance, but it just perpetually looks a little worse for the wear.DesignThe wide mound, rounded edges and lime green color on the screw top make this bottle nice to look at, and the silicone material makes it easy for baby to grip and hold onto.Since the silicone material is a bit opaque, I\u2019ve found that the measurement markings on the bottle are hard to read (especially during nighttime feedings). To see how much Athena has consumed or whether she\u2019s finished the bottle, I have to take it from her and hold it up for a closer look. Also, the soft material makes the bottle a little unstable when standing upright, as I learned the hard way when I accidentally knocked it over before screwing on the top, resulting in some spilled breast milk.",

No tuve ningun problema de confusi\u00f3n en el agarre ni le dio colicos. El flujo esta muy lento, mi bebe si se desesperaba y si le tuve que abrir un poco mas con un alfiler esterilizado, pero supongo que eso depende de cada bebe, prefiero eso a que haya estado muy rapido.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical to buy this bottle but I must say it was a good decision. My 7 week old daughter decided that she no longer wanted to feed from the Dr. Brown bottles and only wanted to breastfeed. I introduced this bottle and she loved it. It's soft and squishy and mimicks the feel of a breast and the nipple is very soft and flexible. I still breastfeed most of the time but I can also get things done and have someone else bottle feed her. It is pricey, but overall it's a really good bottle and did the trick. Will be buying the 8oz one as well.",
