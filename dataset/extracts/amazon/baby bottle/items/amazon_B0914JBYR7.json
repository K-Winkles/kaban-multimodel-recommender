They feel really well made and the small air vent in the nipple allows liquid to flow much faster speeding up feeding time by roughly about half. It seems my son likes them better too since it\u2019s easier for him to drink from. It helps in the middle of the night when your child is crying for a bottle and your exhausted and just want to go back to sleep. I have been very very happy with the few Nuk products I have tried and these bottles are no exception!",

They are easy to clean, assemble and disassemble and my son was able to hold them on his own around 6 months. I also like the larger capacity as I have had two hungry babies who eat more than 5oz in one feed. Definitely recommend!",
