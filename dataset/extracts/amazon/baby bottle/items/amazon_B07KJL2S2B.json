The bottles being glass gives my wife and I peace of mind.The bottles also clean extremely well in a dishwasher. We bought 12 bottles total and we can rotate through 2 sets of 6 bottles and it makes life soo much easier.They're also very durable. We've dropped them on accident both full and empty and they don't have any chips, cracks or scratchesIf you have a fussy baby and the other brands of bottles don't work. I'd recommend these as the wide nipple seems to do the trick in mimicking a breast very well!",

I didn't realize they were glass (definitely my fault haha), but they're super strong! My son loves to throw his bottles and we haven't had any breaks of any kind! These are also the best bottle nipples on the market. They mimic a breast better than other designs, thus making the transition from breast to bottle super seemless. Nice work, team!! I recommend these to every new mom I know, and will continue to do so :)",

These guys have the only nipple-shaped nipples I have found. (And I looked *hard!*) They\u2019re still not ideal from all of the breastfeeding books I have read (again, I looked hard!!!) but the best I could find. And I\u2019m not going to heat anything for my baby in plastic, so this is it.Here\u2019s the problem. Not only do they break (of course they break, they\u2019re glass). They break into more pieces than I have ever seen glass break into. I knocked a bottle off the countertop last week, spent literal hours on my hands and knees trying to get everything up, and I still find shards multiple times a day.Why is this a problem? Because mamas are tired so we break things. And babies are unpredictable so they break things. And you know what else babies do? Crawl on the floor, learn to walk on the floor, and eat anything they can find. So I literally get to watch my baby pick tiny pieces of glass out of our rug all day and run to her before she can get it into her mouth.Do better Lansinoh. I paid $10 each for these things, and a jar of pickles has higher quality glass. They should be tempered glass. They should have integrated silicone pieces to hold the glass together if it breaks. You should have silicone sleeves. I\u2019ve used glass water bottles for years since learning about BPA\u2019s. I\u2019ve broken a few and yet they still hold together just fine.We\u2019re talking about babies here. BABIES. Eating shards of glass. I get that you wanted them to be lightweight so you made them oh so very thin, but just freaking make them smaller instead!Tempered glass people. Silicone sleeves. Plastic around the outside to keep it together. If you don\u2019t do it I am going to freaking start my own bottle company because this is terrible.",

                "reviewText": "Lansinoh is a trusted brand in my household. I breastfed both of my children for 6 months each and their products are definitely perfect for breastfeeding mothers. These glass bottles are absolutely perfect for babies transitioning from the breast to the bottle. The nipple is wide with a narrow end just like the nipple of a breast. You can tell that they are anti-colic and prevent airflow into the babies tummy because air bubbles flow back into the bottle away from the nipple while the baby drinks the milk. It was easy for my son to latch onto the nipple of these bottles. I have not experienced any leaking with these bottles, so that is definitely a plus! The glass is so easy to clean and it is easy to warm milk in these bottles under warm running water in the sink. I love that these bottles are labeled with whole and half ounce increments. The only reason why I gave these bottles 4 stars is due to them only coming with medium flow nipples. My son is a preemie, so I had to purchase the Lansinoh slow flow nipples separately from the bottles. For the price point that these are sold at, this set should definitely include 2 extra slow flow nipples to meet the needs of different babies. Otherwise, with the slow flow nipples these bottles are now my favorite bottle for my baby!",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are high quality which is why I gave the 4/5 stars. It is not the best bottle in my opinion to use for pumping and feeding baby though.If you want a glass bottle and are willing to deal with the issues or just use the for storage then you\u2019ll like them.Upsides: Good quality, milk fat does not stick to the sides as much in the fridge (compared to plastic), bigger size = holds more milk, no fogging over time.Downsides: Bottle *and* milk get too hot in the bottle warmer (even if you pour the milk in a different bottle, it\u2019s too hot for baby), heavy to wear on breast pump and for dropping on toes.I\u2019m not brave enough to give this bottle to a toddler because it is glass. Toddlers drop/throw and glass breaks. I also consider that a downside.Over all it is a well made product. You just need to decide if glass is right for you. I would search harder to find plastic bottles in the bigger size of Lansinoh if I had it to do over again.",
