I prefer these liners over the disposable drop in liners (but both types of disposable liners they offer are a great option). I highly recommend purchasing these! These liners seem to collapse the best out of all the options of liners Playtex Baby offers. I definitely prefer these over the reusable silicone drop in liners. Their reusable silicone liners don't collapse as well and therefore don't get and also don't keep air out of the bottle anywhere near as well.",
