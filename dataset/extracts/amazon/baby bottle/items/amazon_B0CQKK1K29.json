                "reviewText": "Those who are familiar with Dr. Brown's narrow 8 oz bottles will be very familiar with this bottle because it's exactly the same bottle with a different picture on it. Whether it's worth paying a little extra for the design is up to you.Those who are unfamiliar with Dr. Brown's 8 oz bottles, then understand that these are excellent bottles. The anti-colic system works very well. Compared to other bottles that I've used, this is the only bottle that doesn't form a progressively harder suction for you baby with the more they drink. With those bottles, the suction with your baby's mouth will eventually break and a ton of bubbles will form. And since those bubbles forms right by the mouth, the baby drinks it all back in. With these bottles, there is no vacuum forming, so no bubbles ultimately gets created.The biggest problem with the bottle is that (A) it can be a pain to clean and (B) it can leak if the stem and collar are not properly seated. The bottle has more parts than most, so that means more parts to clean. And if the stem isn't seated right, you'll notice milk dripping down your baby's chin. After a while of using the bottle, you'll know to make sure the seat the collar and stem properly before feeding your baby.The original 8oz narrow bottle is great, but has some negatives to it. This bottle is no different as far as I can tell, because it's really the exact same bottle with a different picture printed on it.",

You can buy handles from Dr. Brown's separately if you'd like to, and they also sell sippy cup tops for these bottles. The only downside is that they're kind of a pain to clean. If you want to clean by hand there's so many nooks and crannies. I usually soak mine, then run them through the dishwasher on sanitize.",

Partly because our baby likes the nipple shape better, but we also prefer the shape over shorter wider bottles. Easier for her to hold, now that she is getting old enough to hold them. We did have some issues with the venting on their smaller bottles when using a really small nipple size, but since we started using the larger bottle and now size, we have had no issues with the ventilation leaking. We already had a few of these but liked the woodsy themed art on then.",

                "reviewText": "These type of bottle is great for limiting the amount of air it allows to escape with the liquid. The additional device inside the bottle is a little bit of a pain to clean, but I feel it is worth the effort. The bottle is made of a firm plastic type of material. The nipple is a semi firm silicone type of material. I would say it has a slow to medium flow. They are not harder to clean than most bottles, the interior device is just an extra step that needs a small cleaning brush. Overall I feel they are definitely worth the extra minute to clean.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used Dr. Brown\u2019s glass anti-colic bottles in the past, and while the valves worked well to reduce air in the bottles, they were tricky to align, and the bottles sometimes leaked. These lids, contrastingly, go on tight without much effort. The bottles hold a true 8 ounces.If you\u2019re looking for an option to reduce spit-up, this is a nice solution. It does, however, involve more parts to wash than a typical bottle. For my older baby, I\u2019d leave out the insert. (It works fine with or without.) Overall, nice bottles at a reasonable price.",

No more using 2 4oz bottles in 1 meal.If you have not used dr browns bottles they are incredible. The design reduces bubbles and helps with a good flow. They make enough nipples and tops you can use each bottle for like a year or longer. They even have straw attachments and sippy attachments. These are great bottles and this design pack is so so cute",

                "reviewText": "I like this bottle. Overall, it's best for younger babies with the slow flow nipple. I like that it encourages breastfeeding still by not giving a preferred nipple shape. I'd rather have a slightly higher level of washing the bottle parts than a baby that spits up or is fussy because of gas. I think the designs are cute and the bottles are nice and big so good for outings.",
