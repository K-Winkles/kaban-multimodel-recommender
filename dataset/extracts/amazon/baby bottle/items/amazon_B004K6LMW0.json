Otherwise, It seems to fit most of the other brands. Also It is leak proof and easy to clean. Hope this Helps!",

                "reviewText": "So I was really excited to try these out for my second child since I knew that we would be hitting up several birthday parties this summer and they always have those mini bottles of water, which a toddler under 2 cannot really drink from yet (at least my boys can\u2019t). I even purchased the 3 packs to be able to get them shipped. I even remembered to bring them to the party and low and behold they had the mini water bottles. So I got the spout out and somewhat smugly screwed on the spout and handed it to my 17 month old. Nope. First of all, it leaked from the seal. I didn\u2019t realize that you need some threads to be able to seal the spout onto the water bottle correctly. So I tried to get that plastic ring off of the water bottle to get it screwed down more tightly. Mission impossible. But then secondly, the hole in the end of the spout is designed in such a way that you can\u2019t even get water sucked through it!? What\u2019s the point of that!? I tried to even cut the hole bigger with a scissors and it didn\u2019t even matter!? All the water was spilling from the bottom of the spout and nothing coming out of the actual tip. Ugh. So perhaps with a different water bottle and perhaps if I cut the entire tip off the spout, this may work. And I will try that eventually at the next birthday party. But it did not work when I needed it. Love the concept, but needs some major tweaks! Don\u2019t waste your money - just bring your kids\u2019 actual water bottles to the party.",

                "reviewText": "For whatever reason, my 17-month-old daughter prefers drinking from an Aquafina bottle with this attached over anything else. It doesn't leak, and it's a very handy idea. 2 main problems: first, it doesn't fit the tops of Coca-Cola brand bottles, which includes Dasani, which is the bottled water you're most likely to find on the road. Thus it wasn't nearly as useful during travel as I'd hoped. Second, the cap isn't really adequate - it doesn't have any way of staying attached, so it got lost on the airplane on our most recent trip. It also doesn't keep the inside of the cap clean, so you have to store it in a plastic bag if you're traveling with it. Overall, a good concept, but just not as useful as it could be.",

                "reviewText": "(New edits added to \"COMPATIBLE\" section below.)Sometimes I forget to pack the baby's one and only sippy cup.This 3-piece water bottle cap adapter works well, but yes, I agree that it doesn't have a vent so as the baby drinks from the water bottle through this adapter, the plastic walls of the bottle collapse. Every 4-5 sips, I take the bottle away from the baby, unscrew the adapter, let the air fill up the bottle again, and then hand the whole thing back to the baby. Small inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless. Thus, 4 stars.That drawback aside, there are plenty of benefits:1. COVER EXISTS! It DOES have a clear cap that snaps over the spout! (At least, mine does! I did wonder why previous customers didn't get their caps...)2. PORTABLE! It's small enough to keep in a pocket, purse, pacifier bag... even a Gladware 1/2-cup mini round storage container (the kind you can find at a supermarket or Amazon, 8 units per pack [...]). Yes, a sandwich bag will also do in a pinch.3. EASY TO CLEAN! Each piece -- silicone spout, green \"neck\" and clear cap -- are extremely easy to handwash using the smaller nipple brush attachments that most people have. If water's the only thing that you use it for, there's less of a worry about scrubbing off juice bits.4. COMPATIBLE! For Poland Spring bottles, the adapter works if the green \"neck\" is screwed with the logo upside down. Although the directions do say this clearly, I'd say it here too: If the adapter doesn't work with the particular water bottle you have, try re-inserting the spout through the green neck but in the opposite direction so that the logo on the green neck appears upside down. The green \"neck\" is threaded on both ends, expanding its compatibility with a range of water bottles.EDIT Oct. 2011: Compatible with the Platypus Platy Soft Bottle with Closure Cap. This product combo has proven to be a very convenient way to carry baby's drinking water.5. CHEWABLE! My baby likes chewing thoughtfully on the silicone spout between sips. No damage yet, to baby or bottle cap adapter. But I'm sure Green Sprouts will warn against treating this adapter as a toy. It's not a toy, okay?6. NO LEAKS! If the adapter is screwed on correctly for the water bottle you have (and assuming the two are compatible), turning the water bottle upside down does not create a shower. If anything, it's hard to get liquid out... see drawback above.",
