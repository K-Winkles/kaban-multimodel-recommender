I love it because it\u2019s easy to clean and durable in case the bottle drops. But the way the handle is shaped makes it a little hard for baby to wrap his hands around it. If they wet rounder and not flat maybe it\u2019ll be more comfortable. Good thing my baby loves to keep trying. Wondering if a silicone handle would work better and if that even exists. At least it fits the bottle very well.",

                "reviewText": "The handles are made of a hard plastic. This kind of caught my off guard because I was expecting something a bit more flexible. The edges aren't sharp or anything and attaching it to bottles is very simple. Just place the handle on top of an uncapped bottle then screw on the cap or nipple. The pressure from the cap keeps the handle in place. Based on the tightness of the cap, the handle may or may not allow the bottle to spin just a little. Removing the handle takes the same steps just in reverse; remove the top and the handle slips right off.It fit very well on Philip brand bottles. Other bottles were VERY hit or miss, with more misses than hits in my experience.",
