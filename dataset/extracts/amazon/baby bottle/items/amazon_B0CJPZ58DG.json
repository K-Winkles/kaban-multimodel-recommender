He's always wanting a water bottle like everyone else which usually ends up in a wet shirt and floor. These fun little stocking stuffers ended up being a game changer! He can easily open, close, and drink from the bottle without spilling. These fit our store brand water bottles. The bottles are a little flimsy, so I have to be careful when putting them in not to crush the bottle. Once they are in though, they work perfect.",

                "reviewText": "They work but adult supervision is required. I actually like these water bottle spout attachments. They're easy to attach and can turn most water bottles in an easy to open and drink bottle. I like using these myself and I have no issue with leaks or spills. However, I can see how children could still spill and detach the spout. When I use these for my child I must pay attention and supervise that the spout is not being mishandled. I use these mostly to reduce messes and to make drinking easier speciallyon the go. I still prefer to carry empty extra sippy cups for bottled drinks. These do come in handy when I have to share my drink with my kid.",
