        "description": "Philips Avent Anti-colic with AirFree vent bottles are designed to reduce feeding issues: such as colic, gas, and reflux. The unique AirFree vent is designed to draw air away from the nipple keeping it full of milk to avoid air ingestion. This vent also keeps the nipple full of milk even when the bottle is held horizontal, allowing for upright feeding. Feeding in an upright position can help to reduce reflux and aid in digestion. The nipple shape is designed for a secure latch for a comfortable feed. The bottle is easy to clean and assemble with few parts. The AirFree vent is only one piece and is easy to clean without any special tools. The Anti-colic bottle features a valve, integrated into the nipple, that reduces vacuum buildup and reducing air into your baby\u2019s tummy. The Anti-colic bottle can be used with or without the AirFree vent, giving you the option based on your baby\u2019s feeding needs. The soft silicone nipple is available in different flow rates for babies of all ages, flows 1-4. We recommend using the Philips Avent Anti-colic baby bottle with Philips Avent Anti-colic bottle nipples. Includes 4 9oz Anti-colic bottles with AirFree vent with Flow 2 nipples. SCY703/04.",

                "reviewText": "we used the dr. browns bottles previously, and they were great for our little guy. he has really bad reflux so having a bottle that minimizes air getting through is extremely important. we decided to switch to these during a panicked 2am feeding when i realized none of the clean dr. browns bottles were dry yet. they are SO annoying to wash and dry.these bottles, on the other hand, have been incredible. we have had very little reflux issues, our little guy is eating the appropriate amount, and i don\u2019t want to cry every time i have to wash them!! they also haven\u2019t leaked like the dr. browns ones, to which i owe my sanity as a pumping mom. i can\u2019t afford to be losing any milk!",

                "reviewText": "At first I was all upset that these weren\u2019t sealed and I inspected them and they didn\u2019t have any indication they were used. Had some dust and maybe a bit of residue on the outside of the bottle probably due to storage in the warehouse. Anyways, I was about to return them when I went to the store and checked to see if they should be sealed or not. This company (Avent) is weird. Some of their products like the glass bottles, nipples only and the set with the giraffe pacifier are sealed but the 3 or 4 pack, and individual plastic ARE NOT. Not only this company but as well as Dr. Brown and Nuk. The only ones that I saw was sealed with all their products were the brand Tommee Tippy or MAM. I guess since since you have to sterilize them in boiled water, they thought no need seal. Anyways, I would think anything that touches baby\u2019s mouth should be sealed for sanitation reason. Anyways, I love Avent bottles, I used them on my first baby and they never gave her and hopefully my new baby colic. I did notice one of the green thing was cracked after sterilizing in boiled water, no biggie. These can be a bit tricky and do have some leakage but gotta just readjust baby sucking and no leaking.",
