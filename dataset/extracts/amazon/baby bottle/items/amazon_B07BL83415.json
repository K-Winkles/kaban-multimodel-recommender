                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My baby boy just turned 4 months and has been pretty much refusing to take his tommee tippee anti-colic bottles because I only had size 1 nipples for them an he\u2019s also teething which has been a horrible mix! He would take forever to finish a bottle and get so frustrated.. I know now it was a big mistake not to be prepared with size 2 lol but me and my fianc\u00e9 have also grown so tired of washing all those parts every night, they worked really good for us other wise like helping with gassiness an etc.. but it\u2019s been time for a change. I\u2019ve done a lot of looking an research for something new and fell in love with the reviews and the adorable looks of these! And my baby loves them, it only takes him around 10-15mins tops to finish his bottle and his latch is great on it. they are so easy to clean an sanitize. I bought quite a few so I could have some for at home an always in my diaper bag which works great for us! The color difference in the dark grey and white is also perfect too which I seen most reviews say that they were too similar and the packaging they arrived in was also in great condition unlike some reviews. I\u2019ve never had a leak issue because I make sure the bottle is put together correctly which is really easy! I love these bottles and definitely recommend, I hype them up to everyone. :) also for anyone wondering about the pacifiers, I ordered them off of Amazon also and they are literally the best! They are super light weight and stay in baby\u2019s mouth all night, have a whole bunch of cute colors an sizes. and they\u2019re the only paci on Amazon with just a lil under 20,000 5 star reviews! I also recommend them to everyone and it\u2019s the first gift I\u2019ll buy for anyone expecting or in need of a paci that actually works well. 4 people I know that I recommend them to already went and bought them and it\u2019s the only ones their baby\u2019s will use and they love them to. They are called Tommee Tippee Ultralights!!",

Fairly easy to assemble, you just have to make sure everything is put together correctly or it could leak. The numbers can be hard to read especially if you\u2019re sleepy but at the right angle you can see them. One of the inserts that holds the milk seems to be a little misshapen because we have to adjust it when we place it in the shell every time and the others we don\u2019t, so we just have to remember that. Otherwise, we love these bottles & love that they come in many different colors!",

                "reviewText": "I love the Boon Nursh bottles. They come in 4 oz and 8 oz options. The silicone insert collapses in on itself as baby drinks so that there is no excess air. One thing to keep in mind is if you are making an 8 oz bottle, there is not a lot of room for formula, but if you gently tap the bottle as you are adding, it will settle and not overflow. Also, make sure the lip of the silicone insert is seated properly, or the lid won\u2019t screw on correctly and it\u2019ll leak! But pop it back into place and all will be well. Not a ton of parts to clean and all dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. No weird creases or crevices to worry about either. I\u2019ll be excited to try their other products in the future! (Colors are super adorable as well and do look like their packaging)",
