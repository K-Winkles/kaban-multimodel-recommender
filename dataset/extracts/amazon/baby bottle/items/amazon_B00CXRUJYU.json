While the bags are difficult to get a good reading on when done pumping in to them I solved that problem by purchasing an inexpensive, simple kitchen scale to check the ounces. I use my Spectra or sometimes my Medela hand pump to pump into the bags, weight it, write on the cap and stick in the freezer on the organizing shelf they also have and it\u2019s as simple as that. Popping the bags onto the bottle adapters is easy and my breastfed baby doesn\u2019t have any issues with the nipple, though I do have the adapters for my Dr. Brown\u2019s as well in case. I love having LESS clean up!!",

                "reviewText": "I can not praise this product enough! There is not one single thing I can complain about except the fact that I didn't buy it sooner!!! First of all, WOW! As a mom of 5, and a grandma of 6 I've probably used every single product out there for feeding a baby! I bought this system for my youngest grandbaby that I babysit. I was so sick of washing and sterilizing so many parts to the bottles his momma has for him. He is breastfed so normally his mom would pump breast milk into a bottle. Transfer the milk into a storage bag to freeze. Then thaw out the milk before serving. Pour that milk into another bottle. Feed the baby. Disassemble the bottle (5 pieces!)wash all the pieces and sterilize each item.......Such a hassle!!!I purchased the Kiinde system and it was a game changer!!!!First of all, the Kiinde system comes with a variety of attachments that will fit most breast pumps. You attach the pouch directly to your pump and fill it. The bags are pre-sterilized. You seal the bag with the enclosed lid. You can put the bag immediately into the freezer into your breast milk storage container. (They sell these separately). (The surface of the bags is easy to mark the date and time on). When feeding time comes you can either use the optional bottle warmer they sell or just thaw out in warm water in just a minute or two. Snap the pouch into the bottle and pop a nipple on and you are ready to go. What I like about the pouches is that you can squeeze most of the air out before attaching the nipple and less air in baby's belly! When the baby is finished with their feeding you just toss out the pouch and lid and the only clean up is two items! The bottle and nipple! I also love that the nipple cover is two pieces. There is the cover which is a hard plastic with a top cover and a bottom cover that snap together. If we are out and about I can just put the spare nipples in the diaper bag and always have a fresh one available. Especially for those times when babies are at the age when they like to throw the bottle when you aren't looking and the nipple hits the ground (yuck!). I throw a couple of extra pouches in the diaper bag as well to pour juice in.The optional straws are great for when the baby is a older and you want to give the baby juice or smoothies without fruit chunks. No spills! Easy cleanup with the included straw cleaning brush! Toss out the bag when they are done! The straws have a very sturdy lid/ cover as well!You can also purchase the food package for filling the pouches with baby food. They have the funnels and spoon attachment! So you can actually have a whole feeding system as well!The Kiinde system will easily take you from newborn to toddler with ease! Absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!",

I purchased the whole system including the storage bags, bottles, nipples and bottle warmer. My son is in daycare so he uses these bottles and pouches everyday. He is now 8 months old and we have been using the system for 5 months with no complaints. He took these bottles very easily and has had very little burping. This system is a time saver and makes the whole process of pumping, storing, and transporting the milk to daycare very easy. The only thing that I need to wash are the nipples. This is a great system that I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this breastmilk storage system. It\u2019s incredibly convenient. My baby took to these bottles right away while I was exclusively pumping and transitioned back to breast with no problem. They do still have a little leakage at the sides of the nipple despite the oval shape they have, but the mess was minimal especially with the low flow nipple. The actual bottle itself is really a bizarre shape, but they fit in my insulated bottle holder bag and take up very little space really. If you\u2019re going to be bottle feeding your baby I highly recommend this storage system. I can\u2019t imagine storing milk in bottles in the fridge. It would take up so much space!! These bags are so easy to use although volume measurements are a little difficult to determine. That\u2019s really the only downside. Make sure to check with your insurance too as a lot of them cover pumping supplies!",

                "reviewText": "We bring these bottles to our son's daycare everyday and his teacher puts the nipple on (easily clicks into the Kiinde twist pouch) after heating the pouch in the warmer and TA-DA it's feeding time. With a hungry boy, this bottle is a time saver for sure. I recommend this to every new parent because it is very simple to pump directly into the pouch (or mix formula but I use breastmilk and formula) and then cap the pouch store it until you are ready and then travel with. After the nipple is placed onto the top (after letting out the excess air) the baby is happy because the nipples are very close to natural flow. My son loves the slow flow. I tried medium flow on him after he got older and he still likes the slow flow. This system I think is really easy and good to use. I find the kiinde customer service to be really great as well. They are proactive about getting in touch with their customers and making sure you like their products. I think the whole system is really easy and fun to use.",
