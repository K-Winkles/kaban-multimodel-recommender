You definitely need a smooth surface for it to stay put. I\u2019ve washed it by hand and allowed it to air dry and it is still in great condition. It is helpful when making bottles for my baby while using one hand but only if it\u2019s sucking well onto the surface it\u2019s on, otherwise it will not work. I have it on my nightstand and use it during nighttime feedings to prep the bottle.
