I transitioned using the bottle nipple with the handles in place for two weeks. Once he got that down, we switched to the sippy cup nipple. The only dislike I have is that it does tend to leak with the bottle nipple in place, but to me that was a small issue. Overall, I would highly recommend this product if your child is having a hard time transitioning to drinking milk from a sippy cup!",

                "reviewText": "I have an almost 9 month old Granddaughter. When she turned 6 months old, we started adding water into her diet. This is the sippy cup I decided to try first. I love that it comes with a bottle nipple and a sippy spout! At first, we started using the nipple so she would latch on and drink. Now, we just use the sippy spout with the water.I'm hoping since she's been using this sippy spout for so long, when we transition from formula to milk, she won't want the bottle with formula when she has the sippy with milk and water.The quality of this cup is amaing! The sippy spout is durable! She has 2 teeth already and the spout is still in tact.It's very easy to swap from the nipple to the spout.She shakes the heck out of this cup and it's pretty durable! We do get random drips of water that might fly out if she's banging the cup hard. Otherwise, there's no Spills or leaks at all!It sits up when she sits it down.It's perfect for what it's meant for!I love it so much, I ordered another! For $5, this is the BEST sippy I've ever used and I've had a lot of kids in my care!I'll probably order a third!",

                "reviewText": "This style of cup has been a favorite of my 11 year old (when she was a baby) and my 2 year old. We had one left from my 2 year old, but have lost track of the slit top bottle nipple from his, so I ordered a couple new ones for our youngest baby to try. Pictures show that there was a little bit of some sticky stuff like juice or something on the handle and packaging of the teal cup, but the packaging was clearly in tact and hadn't been opened, so i was not concerned about the condition. And besides, i sanitized them before use anyways, so its really not a big deal. Our youngest is breast fed and has trouble latching onto just about everything we have tried. She seemed able to latch onto the sippy cup spout of my son's cup, but she's just not quite ready for sippy cups yet. She had no idea what to do with it and it came out a bit too fast for her. Well, she tried the nipple on the teal cup last night and was able to latch onto it and even drank a little bit of it too!!! That was so encouraging to see her able to latch and wanting to try to drink from it. Though I'm not surprised, because I have had luck with this style of cup with my older two breast fed babies as well. My only concern is that the pink and teal cups I ordered are made of a different plastic than the blue one we have from my son... it is definitely a cheaper plastic than the older cup and that was a little unsettling. I fear that if my daughter drops it from her stroller or high chair that it will crack and make a mess all over, but I never worried about that with the older blue one. But only time will tell what the quality of these newer ones will be. In the meantime, I give these cups 5 stars because they have done well for my first two kids and I have high hopes that they will stand the test of time with my youngest as well. I would recommend these cups to anyone looking for a transition from breast to bottle for a baby who is starting on baby foods or transitioning from bottle to sippy cup as well. If these new ones fail to meet my expectations the prior cups have set for me, I will adjust my review, but so far so good.",

                "reviewText": "What I like about this cup is the removable baby handles, the ability to switch from bottle nipple to Sippy spout and the fact that it has no weird plastic smell. What I dislike about this cup is that it is very hard to line everything up to screw on the lid. Just when you think you\u2019ve got it, it leaks EVERYWHERE. I found this more with the bottle nipple attachment than the Sippy spout. But we will be picking a different cup for sure.",
