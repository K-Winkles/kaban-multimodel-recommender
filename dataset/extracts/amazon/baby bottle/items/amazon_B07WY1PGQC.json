                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Glass Bottle Review",
                "reviewText": "Glass bottles are hands down better than plastic bottles.I have been using these for the last 1 year approximately . Here are some of the pros:1. Superior heat conductivity: when you are warming up a bottle at night the glass bottles is faster in getting the heat transferred to the liquid compared to your plastic.2. Easier to clean: glass bottles are easier to clean as food residue are less likely to adhere to the walls of the bottle.3. Longevity: plastic bottles deteriorates over time and the scratches from washing makes the bottle milky. The glass bottles are still shiny and there are no visible scratches on the bottle.4. Healthier: no risk of shedding microplastics when heated.5. Microwaveable: can easy heat up a bottle in the microwave.Some Cons:1. Can break easily: I have noticed the necks of the bottle can crack even from small knocks against other bottles. Will break if falls from 4/5 feet height.2. Heavier: traveling with multiple bottles in the baby bag can add to the weight.3. Doesn\u2019t come in smaller size: it only comes in the 8oz size.Edit, Jan 24: another thing I forgot to mention was, the vent, that helps to reduce burping; It is a royal pain in the bottom when it comes to washing, it is the bane of my existence. But it is what it is, unless a design innovation happens parents will have to bear this pain.Net: You may want to buy these if you don\u2019t like plastic. Very solid product.This review is based on my personal experience and use. I have not been paid for this review.",

I find it very hard to feed him with the 8oz bottle and will likely be purchasing either the plastic version or another bottle type when he needs to use the larger size all the time. I would be very concerned about him holding this bottle on his own when that time comes.Note on the 4oz version. While I overall like them and have only a couple plastic ones, the glass ones are more difficult to travel with - you can\u2019t just throw into a bag and not worry. I generally take a plastic bottle when for the diaper bag, but found it a chore to take the glass ones on a recent road trip. Also, the 4oz are a little heavy, but manageable at home.",

I got this style because my husband prefers it.Turns out, I really like it too.I love that it's glass. They clean so much better than plastic. I like this style and the way the silicon sleeves fit it... Because I am a little clumsy, I would not use the glass bottle without the silicone sleeve. I have the shorter and taller glass bottles. And the smaller ones will age well with the baby. They are noticeably lighter than the taller ones and she will be able to hold them easier when she's older.Using these bottles, she's never had a problem with gas/tummy bubbles.2 months of using these bottles all day, every day, and no issues. I recieved one that was broken (chipped) but Amazon replaced it, so no complaints. I do always check them because they are glass... but in my opinion glass is far superior to plastic.",
