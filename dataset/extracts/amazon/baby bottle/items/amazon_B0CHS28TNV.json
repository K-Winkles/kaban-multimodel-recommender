Not only do they fit the Chicco Duo bottles perfectly, but they also served as the perfect transitional aid for my baby to learn to hold his bottle on his own. The ergonomic design makes it easy for his little hands to grip, promoting independence during feeding time. The quality is exceptional, and they are incredibly easy to attach and remove from the bottles. I\u2019m thrilled with how they\u2019ve helped my baby develop his motor skills and gain confidence during feeding sessions. I highly recommend these bottle handles to any parent looking for a practical and effective solution for their little one\u2019s feeding journey.",
