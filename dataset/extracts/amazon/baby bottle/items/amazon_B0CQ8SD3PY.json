                "reviewText": "I am pretty impressed with the quality of these anti-colic style baby bottles. They are very sturdy, durable, and have been leak proof so far. I like the soft material that the nipples are made out of, along with the nicely contoured shape. I think it fits a baby\u2019s mouth much better. These all come with well-designed lids which make them very convenient for travel and storage. In this set they also provided strainer inserts that can be used to help with mixing formula. Using the inserts, the bottle kind of performs a like a shaker bottle, as it helps to break up the powder and accomplish better mixing. I think this four pack is a reasonable value, and because they are dishwasher safe, clean up is a piece of cake. I\u2019m happy with them so far, and I think they would make a nice gift set as well.",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are made of plastic and come in tan, brown, and two shades of pink. I\u2019m not sure what the strainer like piece is supposed to be for, but it is not attached to the bottle in any way so it\u2019s easily removable. The bottles all come with lids which is nice for packing a bottle for a short trip. You can use anti colic bottles for any baby. The listing says you can put them in the dishwasher or microwave although I probably would not do that. These would make a great gift for new parents",

They wash easily, I usually put them in the dishwasher.I like that they come with an insert to help mix the milk powder.They don\u2019t leak and fit together really well and easily.Love the 4 different colors.They have anti colic holes to help flow the air into the bottle and stop the nipple from being sucked in.I really recommend these bottles!",
