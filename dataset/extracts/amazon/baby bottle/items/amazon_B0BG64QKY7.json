These remind me of the Philips Avent Natural from several years ago before they updated it if that makes sense. Anyway, she very rarely chokes on these, but they flow a bit faster than Tommee Tippee so we aren't working on a bottle for 45+ minutes. I'm so happy I bought two packs of these and I'm trying out the fancy comfort ones. I also love the sweet designs. I couldn't find these on the manufacturer website so that makes me a bit sad. If anyone has links to \"upgrade\" the nipples to faster flow as she gets older, please help me out!",
