On the part of the nipple that fits inside the ring there are three little \"bubbles\" that I assume help with air flow. If they split open then the nipples leak a lot so you should throw those out. The other problem is that the ink becomes gummy when warm. Most of the bottles I got have no numbers left and the little designs are worn away to varying degrees. Definitely only a temporary solution to the bottle dilemmna.",

                "reviewText": "These were great. Until the designs got sticky and started rubbing and peeling off. We hand wash our bottles as they don't get very clean in the dishwasher (because they are so narrow) so I don't think that our washing is what caused the designs to get sticky/tacky. I ended up recycling the whole lot of them. I would not buy these again, or recommend them.",
