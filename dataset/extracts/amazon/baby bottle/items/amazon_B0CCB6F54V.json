Dr. Talbot\u2019s Silicone Anti-Colic Bottle is made of soft silicone that is easy to squeeze, encouraging milk flow and assisting little ones during feeding. Dr. Talbot\u2019s Silicone Anti-Colic Bottle has a venting system that draws air to the base of the bottle which helps reduce colic symptoms like wind, reflux, and fussing. The bottle features a Soft Flex Simple Latch Nipple designed to mimic mom\u2019s nipple, encouraging latch-on. The nipples also have internal ridges that prevent the nipple from collapsing while baby is feeding. When feeding time is over, the bottle\u2019s multi-part venting system can be fully removed for thorough cleaning. Sterilization is easy and convenient thanks to the bottle\u2019s self-sterilizing system that uses only the bottle\u2019s components, water, and a microwave.

                "reviewText": "I got these to try for my baby that was about 9 months at the time. They are nicely made, do not leak anywhere, and fairly easy to clean. However my baby wasn't crazy about the nipple and the flow was way too fast for his preference. That said, I don't think it's fair to give the product a bad review bc my baby is super picky about the nipple and flow rate. I think if you have a baby that is used to Tommy tippee or comotomo, or boon nursh, this would be a good option for a smoother, air reduced feeding bottle. I was able to use my comotomo adapter to pump directly into this from my Medela flange setup. However it wasn't perfect so I had to be mindful and not move around a lot for fear of bumping and disconnecting it. I actually found a sippy cup top and have been using it for my older toddler and she loves it! She loves that the bottle is silicone and \"squishy\" and i notice her using it as a self soothing method.My recommendation would be to make the silicone on the nipple alittle bit softer/squishier for the smaller bottles that would be being used for newborns to 3/4months, and maybe a little bit more of a gradual slope to the nipple instead of such a drastic difference from the nipple itself to the base.",

                "reviewText": "This bottle is made of silicone which makes it flexible and it has good grip to it. The bottle has an anti colic system. The inner part of the bottle has multiple parts which is can be hard to take it apart and put it back together to clean it between bottle feedings. The nipple seems to be soft but the suction on this is very slow. I think this will be great for breastfeeding moms, it will help them transition from bottle to breast without any issues. THe bottle is 5 oz so it will last for a few months. The bottom of the bottle is sturdy so the bottle wont tumble. The coolest thing about this bottle though is that this bottle is designed to sterlize in the microwave by putting all the items inside the bottle upside down.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start by saying that we received a Dr. talbot\u2019s bottle in our baby box from Amazon. So far that bottle and the nanobebe bottles we have are the only bottles my newborn accepts since she\u2019s exclusively breast fed when we have to put breast milk in a bottle she refuses all other bottles. So It was a no brainer for us to purchase another Dr. Talkbot\u2019s bottle. I was excited to open it this morning. BUT when I opened the Amazon package the box the bottle was in was tore open and smashed and the bottle itself was discolored. Our other Dr. Talbot\u2019s bottle from Amazon was perfectly clear with zero discoloration. So being compared to that this new bottle is tinged a slight yellowy color. I\u2019m super disappointed because we were very excited to have an extra bottle for the moments when it\u2019s needed.Don\u2019t get me wrong though, these bottles are THE BOMB! Just very disappointed in this delivery from Amazon.",

The advanced venting system helps reduce the amount of air your little one ingests while feeding, which can help minimize gas and colic symptoms. The silicone material is not only safe and durable but also easy to clean. The bottle's wide neck makes it a breeze to fill and the measurement markings are clear and easy to read. The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable grip while feeding. Whether you're a new parent or have been through it before, Dr. Talbot's Anti-Colic Silicone Bottle is definitely worth considering to help make feeding time a little easier for you and your baby.",
