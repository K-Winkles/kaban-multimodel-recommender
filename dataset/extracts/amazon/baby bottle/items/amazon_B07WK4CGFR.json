                "reviewText": "I have looked far and wide for an ACTUAL spill proof bottle/sippy. THIS IS IT! Others still leak a little when you shake them. This one does not. I put it thru all the tests because my 2 yr old is in a savage sabotage phase and deliberately tries to spill her milk. Needless to say I was sick of smelling spilled milk and having to hunt down the source like a hound dog, so I started looking for a cup/bottle that wouldn\u2019t spill. I mean it when I say this WILL NOT spill. Just don\u2019t stick a nipple brush thru the nipple hole. If you do, it will eventually start leaking a TINY bit. I mean I have to really shake the one that I did this on to get it to leak. This is the only kind I\u2019m buying from now on. I currently have 6!",

She refused then I got this one as a gift and ever since then she\u2019s been using them, purchased 4 more. Will be purchasing another 2-4 to complete what I need. But SO HAPPY WITH MY Purchase, leak proof spill proof for sure, her baby bottle would leak SO MUCH, other sippy, terrible, this one . No issues!!!",

                "reviewText": "My 2 yr old refuses to let the \"bottle\" go. It's his pacifier, his security blanket. He rejects the sippy cup so this was a great alternative to be able to toss out the baby bottles. The handles are removable and the nipple is less like a baby bottle nipple. Unfortunately the seal can some times not align properly and you have to put a little more effort to align than you would a traditional bottle (it has less rotation & space between the handles) but otherwise it works great. I also don't know how my baby managed to get a hole/crack I'm the recessed center of the nipple but it's there and now fluid leaks out a little more. Mixing a little chocolate in with the milk can get a bit messy shaking it up. Can leak from the nipple and ring. The bottle shape is nice but he makes use of the handles which is great and on target for development.",
