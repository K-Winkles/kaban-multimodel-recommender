                "reviewText": "I bought 12 of these bottles even after reading all the complaints. The bottles came in individual plastic wrap with the nipple upside down so they were in the bottle and the ring screwed on. Other than it's slower to feed my goats they hold more milk. Heating the bottle takes a little longer. Very durable. I'm washing them in top rack of my dishwasher and handwashing the nipples. Out of the 12 bottles I received one leaked from the nipple and the vent hole. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, they will definitely last a long time AND I was excited and surprised to see the ounces marked on the side. I had looked for this but the pictures didn't show it. I was planning to use a measuring cup to pre measure and mark the bottles for future use. Glad I didn't have to do any of that. I do have a weak kid so I'm still using the Pritchard nipple on her. These definitely need good sucking goats. Our of 12 bottle babies they took perfectly to the new nipple within the first day all but my weak one. Who is doing well by the way.",

                "reviewText": "So i read all the reviews and looked high and low on the internet. I even went to two local farmstead type stores (not TSC) and i just wasnt happy. I wasnt happy about what i read here either but for $6 how can i go wrong. I bought two one for each Alpine kid. ALL the reviews of the bottle in an \"as is condition\" are correct. The bottle is terrible **until** you modify the nipple. If Dr Browns made a goat bottle that of coarse would be better (i kno i got a laugh from the recent parents)......Mods to the nipple...very easy. The very top is cut like a cross. When u squeeze the top you can clearly see 4 triangles. Very simply cut one triangle out. Then i also made 3 more 1/8\" slices with a nice sharp razor blade around the base of the nipple so when the goat pulls the nipple the slice opens up and lets air in. I successfully allowed my wife who first told me the bottles sucked to do another feeding without knowing what i did and i passed the dad mod test. Goats were happy....i heard the air guzzling in as they drank....mom was happy...real kids happy......dad wins....... I think these are very good bottles easy to clean and easy for young kids to hold.One word of caution.....when u turn the bottle over...the milk will leak out the end of the nipple...but if u do it right and let the goat jump towards nipple while u hold it kinda sideways so it dont leak u can get them to latch without spilling.... Bit of common sense and problem solving goes a long way.....",

My LaMancha baby really likes the size of the nipple compared to anything else I was able to offer him, I wish the bottle size was a little smaller since I\u2019m only using 8 ounces each feeding and the bottle is too large to fit in our microwave so I have to heat my milk up separately. I do feel like it\u2019s a good quality for the price and it is getting the job done just a little messier than I was hoping for",
