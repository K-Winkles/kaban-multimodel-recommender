Their relaxed lips make a softer, more airtight latch and they swallow much less air - up to 44% less air. That\u2019s what we call real anti-colic. Combining our unique air vent and deeper latch design, Smilo nipples help baby have an easier, uninterrupted feed. Simple. Compared to other feeding bottles, Smilo delivers more fluid for the same effort. That's how we minimize babys colic-forming air intake. If your family is transitioning to Smilo we recommend trying a nipple stage flow slower than you currently use. Smilo Bottles come fitted with Stage 0 Nipples, suitable for Newborn to 2 months. Faster flow nipples are available to meet your babys growing developmental needs. Our nipple stage guide will help you select the correct flow rate for your child\u2019s developmental needs. The age guidelines are approximate and some babies may take up to a week to transition to the next stage.",

                "reviewText": "I love the clean look on these bottles! I use these bottles for both formula and breast milk, which do not stain or stick to the bottle as neither does the breast milk oily fattiness. I've been sanitizing my bottles 1x a week in the dishwasher and to this day they have held up great! These bottles look like glass bottles and are super light weight! I've had for 3 months and just ordered my second stage nipples and the larger size bottles to use as my little one grows. I really can not compare to other bottles as far as my son latching better or less to others as I only gave tried these and he latched on right away. The shape of the bottle is prefect for my 3 month old to now hold.",

                "reviewText": "I love these!! They clean wonderfully, not cloudy!! They work wonderfully and They are beautiful! The nipples that come with the short bottle are 0-2 months... which is what I needed- but they sell the other stage nipples on the site, which is awesome so I can use the bottles forever.I like them better than Como because they're clear, I can see what's left better. they're skinnier, easier to hold for feeding an infant, baby like them better too. Also with como, you have to be careful not to queeze them as milk with shoot into BBs mouth(not cool bro). I'll still use the como bottles bc they're great bottles too, they clean well and they're super cute! I feel like the Como will be better as my son ages.",

                "reviewText": "These bottles are amazing! Got the large ones for my 2mo old because they'll last longer. They are super easy to clean, the plastic is a clear as the day we got them and hasn't turned foggy or dingey. The numbers on the side are easy to read. Although my baby does still spit up a bit it has gotten sooo much better since we switched to these bottles. If I had to be nitpicky I'd say my only criticism is that the caps are super hard to put on and remove but that's not that big a deal. Also I'm not a fan of the replacement nipples coming in packs of 6 when the bottles come in packs of 3 but, once again, not that big a deal.Love these bottles! Will recommend to anyone who asks!",
