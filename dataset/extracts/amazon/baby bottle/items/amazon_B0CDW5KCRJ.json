                "reviewText": "Philips Avent bottles worked really well for our babies and it is also their favorite bottle out of all the others we've tried. However, finding replacement parts on the other hand was a nightmare (Philips does sell replacement nipples, but everything else seems non existent). This nipple ring set allows us to extend the use of our bottles from our first child to the second baby, we can replace the nipples and old rings, so that he can have the same colic-free experience as his older brother. These parts also help us save money that would go towards milk, formula, and diapers.",
