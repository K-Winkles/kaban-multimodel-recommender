He has thrown this thing on the hardwood floors more time than I can count, and it hasn\u2019t broken yet or leaked.",

                "reviewText": "I got this sippy cup for my 7 month old baby to help him transition from bottles to sippy cups. It\u2019s really great and works perfectly as a baby\u2019s first learning cup. It\u2019s especially designed for babies starting at 7 months and has both babies\u2019 and parents\u2019 needs in mind.The quality of this cup is amazing. It\u2019s made with highest quality silicone and plastic and is BPA free. The cup itself is large and can hold a lot of water, milk, etc., which is convenient. It\u2019s standard size width and fits into cup holders, strollers and car seats.The handles on the sides are big and easy for baby to grab and hold onto. And the straw mouthpiece is elongated and longer than usual which baby seems to like. The silicone is thick and durable, doesn\u2019t damage easily.The best part is that the cup not only works well but is easy to clean. The weighted straw inside the cup is easily removable for cleaning and the included cleaning brush is easy to use and gets into the hard to reach places.",
