                "reviewText": "I love these bottles! The leaking that people are posting about is user error. I learned that after it is warmed in the bottle warmer I have to readjust the lid or else it will leak. I\u2019m not sure why but it\u2019s a quick easy readjustment and i don\u2019t mind that! It stops leaking if i just refit the lid. We love the shape of this bottle and that it still fits in my small bottle warmer properly!",
