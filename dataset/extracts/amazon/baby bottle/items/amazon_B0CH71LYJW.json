They're cute and functional. They could stick a bit better, especially after washing, but overall, they do the job well. Definitely makes life easier for labeling everything!",

They have decent designs and it\u2019s nice that there\u2019s 2 sizes to choose from. They stick well to cardboard or plastic but not good for sticking on clothes tags or tags for stuffed animals, mesh packing cubes, pacifier holder stuffies, etc\u2026 I used a sharpie pen to write on them, so that could be why they smudged easily if I didn\u2019t wait at least 30 seconds to take off the label and apply to whatever I needed to. I put these on my son\u2019s bottles for daycare and as soon as I washed them the next day they were ruined. So glad I put them at the bottom and not anywhere visible since the residue I have to clean off isn\u2019t pretty now that these practically dissolved after 3 washes. I use a bottle brush and lightly scrub the outside so it\u2019s not like I used a dish sponge for this to have happened so soon. I ordered personalized ones that state they are waterproof so hopefully those work better for anything that I need to wash or run through the laundry. I\u2019m just keeping these as backup and to use on stuff that I\u2019ll eventually be tossing like his diaper cream tubes or teething gels and diaper/wipe packs.",

I don't know if what they say about rewashing etc. is true but I have to reason to doubt them. There are 720 baby bottle labels so you can use them to label a multitude of things. They are very cute.",

Other people are looking over this part and think well I have 720 of them so I can replace them. Well there this product fails as well. When you peel off the old sticker it leaves a residue that does not come off with regular washing. I have to use harsh chemicals such as rubbing alcohol or acetone to take it off.",
