                "reviewText": "I love the concept of the idea. A hands free approach and to help babies 4+ months to learn to use their hands and gain some control on their own feedings. Even it's just to learn some hand control.Now here are the cons on the product. Again I love the concept of the idea, but I think it could've been executed differently. In a way it was created poorly. First of all whomever created the product didn't place in mind how much time it takes for parents to wash this item. You have 2x tubes short and long, you have 2x caps one for the bottle and one for the nipple, 1x nipple, 1x bottle, 1x cap, 1x adapter to the nipple, 1x disk adapter for the bottle, and 1\u00d7 silicone disk. That's 10 different parts if you break it all down. I timed myself when properly washing this product, and let's just say I could've washed 4 different bottles with the amount of time I had to use to wash this product. To use on the go yes it's great but to set it up again and having to wash it, gets tiring. Seriously what parent has the time to wash just one of these bottles? Even though my child has her dad and myself. With other chores in the house and baby having her needs met, it's just not worth it. I have a better way to approach this idea, but I would have the company reach out to me if they wish to know.Either way great idea \ud83d\udca1 \ud83d\udc4d Just poorly executed.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was spending literally hours per feed on my 4 week old, who would go through growth spurts of downing two 4 oz bottles consecutively, but required a slow flow nipple due to her size. My wrists were hurting, and I would frequently create makeshift props for bottles when I needed to reach or grab for something. Then I stumbled across this amazingness.Some assembly required, but it's pretty straightforward and comes with a diagram. I wish it would have been more clear on the parts, though, and what each one does. For example, it did not describe the nipples.Comes with four Nipples, one each of:Size 1Size 2Size 5Size 8Seems the size 1 nipple is for bottle feeding without the tubing (this can be used like a regular bottle as well). I tested each out by sucking on them myself; when attached to the tubing, even I had difficulty creating enough suction to get fluid up the size 1 nipple.I ended up using the size 8 nipple for my newborn. I was concerned with air trapped in the tubing and nipple (see videos), so I went ahead and sucked out the air myself until the tubing and nipple were filled with formula, and then rinsed off the nipple tip before giving to my newborn.The bottle says for use with infants who can sit up only (3 months+) but it works well with my baby when she's propped up - just be sure bottle us level with her mouth to prevent siphoning effect.Also, make sure the tubing end us IN FORMULA (duh-like a straw) or else she will suck in air. Anyways, I'm thrilled. :)",
