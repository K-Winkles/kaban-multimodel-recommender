I was looking for new bottles because my one month old daughter was having trouble drinking from a bottle without it being a complete mess. She had the most success with the nipples that are designed for the Enfamil nursettes. I picked this set up to try because I like that it had different sizes as she moved to different formula amounts, as well as having other extras.There are four nipples in this set - two slow flow and two medium flow. The bottles are easy to hold and easy to clean because of the wide mouth. I have no problems reaching all the sides and bottom. The soother included is a great light weight small one for little babies. I also like that it includes the handle adapter for when she can hold things better.At first she was still messy when drinking from these bottles, but now at almost 3 months old she is managing the medium flow nipples well. I like that these should see us through her bottle needs.",
