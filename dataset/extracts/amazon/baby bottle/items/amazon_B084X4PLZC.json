One time my son dropped the bottle and it did explode, the top flew off and water spilled. But you can lay the bottle on the couch and it won\u2019t spill at all.",

The no-spill feature is a lifesaver, especially during those hectic morning rushes or car rides.What I love the most is that they are BPA free, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my children are not exposed to harmful chemicals.These bottle top spouts are simple to use and clean, making them a practical choice for busy moms like me. They have certainly made meal times less messy and more enjoyable for my family.",

What i found was that when the bottle would be turned up to drink out of the liquid would leak out around the rim and it was very difficult to drink out of the mouth piece. You literally have to lightly bite and suck the liquid out at the same time. Too dang hard to drink using these.",

                "reviewText": "I am a parent doing the unending dance of trying to find a water bottle solution for my kids. Something easy to clean, spill resistant, easy to drink from, and preferably easy to use. I know it is a lot to ask. But these bottle toppers cover almost all of those criteria. It is pretty easy to insert them in a standard water bottle. It is a little tougher with those thin water bottles from walmart but definitely doable. It is easy for the kids to drink from them and close the top back. Though, even when they don't close the top, the stoppers do a pretty good job of not spilling. When it is time to clean them they do great in the dish washer or in the sink with a little bottle brush. The one drawback that we have encountered... the littlest kid likes to chew on things. She winds up widening the slit at the top of the stopper and ruining the \"seal.\" In the scheme of drawbacks, it is my own kids fault, but something that may affect you too. I LOVE that I can just throw the stopper in my bag and get a water bottle wherever I am and don't have to lug a whole bottle around. And having 3 colors lets me tell the kids bottle apart at home. If you re on the mythic toddler cup hunt please do consider these, even as just a travel part of your setup.",
