Mixing a bottle with those things just doesn\u2019t always go well if you\u2019re approaching the max amount of formula in that size bottle. There\u2019s not enough room for the water and formula to mix.2. These DO NOT LEAK. Period. They just travel and shake well.3. You don\u2019t have to use the little white bottle discs. Or if you use them to prevent water from leaking, you can the. Use this to mix formula. Personally, I hate traveling all day with premade bottles. It\u2019s a lot to carry in 10 oz bottles. It\u2019s so much easier to pack one formula container, one water container and a couple of lids.",

But I find I don't use it very much since getting a decent sized Thermos to store the boiled water for the formula. I just bring the bottles with the regular vent system and nipple attached and then pour the desired water into the bottles when needed. I realized I will need to get a storage container for the vent/nipple/cap if I use these travel caps on-the-go. And I haven't gotten around to getting that container. But these ravel caps are great! No leakage and I use them when I need to shake up some formula at home.",
