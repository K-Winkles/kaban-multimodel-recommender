                "reviewText": "SAVED MY LIFE. And my ears. My 4th baby girl is my most stubborn and hard headed baby. When she\u2019s hungry (which is often) she will let us know and it isn\u2019t pleasant. She\u2019s a yeller. She is 4 months old and car rides and walks have been nothing but anxiety-filled escapades. We had started to ensure we had what we called the \u201ccar baba\u201d before any trip, short or long. But holding it propping the bottle wasn\u2019t always easy or doable, and we were all losing our minds. This bottle has saved us! I can\u2019t even begin to explain the difference from propping or holding a bottle to the ease of this. She had no nipple confusion between this, breastfeeding, pacifier, and her other bottle. She took to it easily and she even holds onto the tube or the top mouth piece and can generally get it back into her mouth if she accidentally pulls it out of her mouth. It doesn\u2019t leak if it does come out of her mouth and just hangs around. It\u2019s easy to assemble (there are pictures, so not sure where the confusion is for assembly if you get the insert), and easy to clean.The ONLY negative I can see is what someone else mentioned regarding the lack of a clip or something that could hold the top tubing and nipple so it isn\u2019t just loose and hanging. But, like the other reviewer, we just lightly wrap it around the top. Not a deal breaker by any means, but future design of the bottle should incorporate this to max out its potential as the best bottle ever. We do only use this when we go on walks or car rides. Otherwise, I nurse her or use her other bottle while holding her.",

Keep in eye on your baby as it might happen to get stuck or get a bubble if your baby stops suctioning, that\u2019s why I waited for my baby to be older and be able to burp on her own, because they might get some air flowing in between. Normally I have to start the bottle from the straw and then connect it to the nipple otherwise she will get frustrated because it take a few for the milk to get to the nipple. Cleaning is a little complicated but not impossible y just let the hot water run through for a while and then use the cleaning tool they give u. I really like it and use it a lot specially when I have a lot of work to do. Don\u2019t use it at night when sleeping, you do not want to fall asleep and have an accident or have your baby shocking with the tube around their necks. Be careful.Overall I do like it and use it",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this initially because the Podee bottle was out of stock everywhere and the people that did have it wanted 5 times the amount it was sold for in stores. When I purchased it I did so knowing I\u2019m a breast feeding mom and my son needs to be pace fed. I paid for rush shipping got it in 2 days and immediately tried it. Now before I get into that let me tell you I also ordered the turn any bottle into a Podee bottle.The Tinukim bottle, super easy to set up and clean. My son took to it immediately. The hoses are easy to assemble and clean as well. They are a little flimsy but I actually found that to be quite nice for my son. Not to easy that my son isn\u2019t working for his mean but not to hard that he ends up with a stomach full of gas and crying giving up because it\u2019s to much work. Although it\u2019s a bottle he isn\u2019t detoured from being breast fed because now he\u2019s being fed properly by the bottle and not by one that constantly leaks or drips into his mouth.I absolutely love this bottle! I do wish I had a 4 ounce one because it\u2019s just to big to be honest he only eats 2 ounces at a time right now. But he will grow into it.The Podee kit in comparison there is none. That podee setup sucks. It\u2019s to hard for my son to get any milk out of. He cries and gets mad. I tried it to help him and it\u2019s so much resistance it\u2019s impossible to say that mimics pace feeding. More like starvation! The hoses are so hard to clean they don\u2019t have any give or forgiveness. Disconnecting the hoses takes the jaws of life and it\u2019s annoying. The nipple is way to hard and the whole is huge still not helpful for a child.Winner by a long run is the tinukim bottle.",

                "reviewText": "In theory this is an amazing invention, however its tedious to wash after every use. I purchased this for when we\u2019re traveling and I\u2019m unable to hold my l.o bottle, so i don\u2019t use it daily for each feeding. I would imagine that the tube insersts wont hold much roughhandling/washing and will frey. That being said my kiddo is 8 months old, refuses to hold her bottle, so this is a lifesaver for toad trips but since she is already 8 months, shes able to pull off the tubes. Happened once already. But i love it. Saves my sanity on road trips.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I used it the same day it was delivered. I needed this and it worked for me perfectly. At first glance it seems intimidating-maybe complicated, but there were instructions on paper on how to assemble it. I still have many (14) other normal bottles. I bought the \u201ctwo pack,\u201d for when I\u2019m busy, nothing beats holding your baby in your arms and feeding her/him. Sometimes mommy is just too busy. Only difficulty I have with this bottle is the numbers, I cannot freaking see it, I need to measure 6 ounces of water and I cannot see the six, I\u2019m pissed off about that, they should put the numbers in color, they just etched it in the bottle. Other bottles use white paint for the markings so we can clearly see the numbers, so we don\u2019t get frustrated bending down- feeling the imprint- putting it to the light-etc- that frustrated me.One more thing, I suck up the milk into the nipple before putting it in her mouth, starting it for her, clearing any air trapped in straw.",
