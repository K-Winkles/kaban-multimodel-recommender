                "reviewText": "Love this size bottle. It's easy for me to hold and can be used with or without the complicated anticolic middle pieces. Has a 3 stage nipple and a spout nipple replacement. One feature I love is the plastic disc piece so that you can store milk in it without a nipple. I make up abou 8 ounces of formula at a time and use it in 2 to 3 ounce increments during the day so i don't have to make bottles ahead of time..When my 2 month old is ready to take a size 3 nipple or spout i will begin to work with her. I got the older model with hearts. It comes with a brush for cleaning the anti colic inside tube, a stage 3 Dr.Brown's Options silicone nipple, a silicone spout for teaching sippy cup drinking, a top, and a ring along with the disc that is flat.It will hold more than 9 ounces, but I dont have trouble with leaking. I can put 11 ounces in it and not have any leaking. A too tight ring can cause leaks as well as one that is too loose.",

It's also hard to put it into the top so you have to forcefully push it into the bottle cap. Even after doing that and closing the bottle tight, it leaks if you gently shaking the bottle to mix the formula. Original bottles l worked great though....",
