                "reviewText": "I\u2019m happy enough with this product. Overall my 9 month old didn\u2019t quickly take to this item and it was a little tricky figuring out all the little bits and how to assemble it so that food does squeeze out the sides.Now that I\u2019ve figured that all out things are going a bit better WHEN baby is interested in using this! It\u2019s a must have when I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t have time to sit down and feed baby, but need baby to get some food. It\u2019s also super useful for when I don\u2019t have pouches on hand. I\u2019m able to scoop the food into these with a small spoon, albeit a bit messily, and then baby can eat some food from this.The amount of food that baby consumes using this feeder is never equal to the amount eaten when I am feeding baby, so I can\u2019t count on it to get baby full. Baby probably only eats 1/3 when I fill it all the way up.I was quite disappointed that the clear plastic feeding mouth stained orange after just one carrots session. It would have been better for them to include two feeding nipples. It\u2019s also not completely mess-proof. If baby gets the wrong end in his hand (and he does) he sometimes has a squeezing party, but this is still less messy than getting a whole pouch in his hands.Other than that I\u2019m happy with it and it works for me in a pinch.",

I will return if possible, if not I will take a pair of pump pliers and see it I can open with extra squeezing power. This feeder is not usable for my.The soft food holder end can be pulled away from the device and the nipple can be pulled out of the top end, I just can't open it properly.Really Bad Design!",
