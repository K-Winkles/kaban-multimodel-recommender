                "reviewText": "Very happy with these bottles. If you're looking at this you probably already know why you'd want larger bottles (you pump more than 5-6 oz per side at a time and overflow the bottles that came with your pump, and/or you single-pump and don't want to have to empty the bottle in between sides, etc.). These are great for those purposes. Fits the standard wide-mouth threading of, for example, the Spectra S2. Sometimes they don't lock on to the flange and I recommend a small piece of masking tape across flange to bottle to prevent the bottle twisting off when that happens (or for backup; I just do it all the time so I don't have to think about it). Not enough to ding a star for in my book.The volume markings are accurate and include 0.5 oz increments starting at 2 oz (also 10 mL increments starting at 60 ml). The markings are very persistent. There is no sign of any degradation in the printing after a couple weeks of daily washing. (Compare this to the collection bottles which came with my spectra pump; the ink came off completely within a week or two).The lids are great. They seal well. When assembled they function as one piece (unlike the fiddly plastic disk you use with many bottle rings), and they pop apart easily for cleaning. I haven't written on them.Update 4/9/17 (over a month later):I stopped using the tape as the bottles started locking securely to the flanges again (not sure why). The volume markings are still perfect after about two months of daily use/washing. Great purchase.Update 6/5/17Bottles still look new and no trouble with the bottles staying attached to the flanges in the past two months. 5 stars all the way!Update 6/19/19, with pictureI used these for almost 10 months, and while the marks did eventually degrade some, all were still readable. I\u2019ve now used them another month or two. The markings are well-worn but mostly useable (see picture). Aside from that, the bottles are completely functional and I\u2019m considering getting a second set.",

I take one 6 hour stretch and it was getting to the point that I was having to switch bottles on one side during the morning pump because I was almost overflowing. The marks on the bottle are very clear and include 5mL increments which is REALLY nice. The lids that they come with are nice because you can write on them. I have a Spectra Synergy Gold for my pump and these fit my flanges perfectly. No complaints and definitely worth the money especially because you get 4.",

                "reviewText": "I love these! I plan to use them to transport pumped milk home from work but at the moment I am using them to store pumped milk in the fridge before dividing and freezing. I love the silicone in the lid - it creates an awesome seal but is also super easy to pop out and in for cleaning. A standard bottle brush fits these bottles well so they're a easy to clean. They are marked to hold 4.7 oz but you could really fit 5 oz in each if you don't need to see the exact measurements. They fit my Spectra S1 flanges directly and also standard wide mouth bottle lids/nipples (I've tried both Avent Natural and Nanobebe with success). No issues sterilizing or heating in a bottle warmer.",
