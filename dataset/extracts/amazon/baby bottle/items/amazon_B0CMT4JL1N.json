The bottle that I was trying to use is wider at the top & bottom, and concave shape in the middle. So this doesn\u2019t work for us. We tried to twist the silicone to turn to see the amount left in the bottle (good feature) - however, the silicone was so tight that we couldn\u2019t get it to twist around. There was no information sent with these to say what size bottle to use them on. This is too small for our bottles. I still think that the silicone should stretch easier to make it useful for more sizes and not be so stiff.",
