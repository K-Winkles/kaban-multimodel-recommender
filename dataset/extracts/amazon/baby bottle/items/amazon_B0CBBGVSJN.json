They are priced so well that I bought more than I needed just in case we ever lose one along the way.I also like using it for premixing formula to store in the refrigerator.Edit: I have seen some reviews mention leaking. In my experience the leaking only happens when the water you are using to mix is not room temperature. If it\u2019s a little bit warm then I have drips coming out. Other than that, I have had no problems with leaks. I even live at a higher elevation and when we go to town and return home the bottle never has leaked in my bag. If we have a random plastic water bottle we can see the pressure change between home and town",

If you don't screw it on just right and tight enough we've had a tiny bit of leakage when mixing/shaking formula. I wouldn't trust these free rolling around a bag or anything but we've traveled with them full of formula secured in a bottle pocket with no issues.We got these to use as caps with some extra Philips anticholic bottles we have. We use the Philips bottles in the Philips Avent bottle warmer because we use Mam anticholic bottles for feeding and I hate having a bottle with warmer water all over it when trying to feed (plus, as an aside, the Mam anticholic bottles don't warm very well IMO due to the thick plastic). So these caps work great for our purposes.",
