Serves a purpose and I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. Cleaning them was an easy task with a bottle cleaner and so far they haven\u2019t melted with hot water.",

Unfortunately the material the nipples are made from is so thin that they capsize when a baby is sucking and prevent milk from flowing out. I often have to remove the bottle from the babies mouth so the nipples can Re inflate. It became so frustrating that I've ordered new nipples to replace these. Otherwise the bottle design is nice. Lightweight but sturdy",
