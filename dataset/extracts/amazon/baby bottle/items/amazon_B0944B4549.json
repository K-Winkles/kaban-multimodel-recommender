                "reviewText": "If you are hesitating on purchasing nanob\u00e8b\u00e8 over another bottle, don\u2019t! After hours of reviewing (agonizing over) bottles and reaching into the depths of every single mommy to be website for advice on what to get I fell in love with the idea of a bottle designed for breast feeding moms that was easy to clean. I received the nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 starter set from my registry and it was the absolute best gift we received. We received other bottles sets (doc brown and Phillips Avent and they do not hold a candle to nanob\u00e9b\u00e8). No nipple confusion, no gas, no colic, and baby loves the bottles. We also got the nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 pacifiers to round out the set (extras of the ones we received in the starter) and they are wonderful. They are the only pacifiers our baby will use! I had custom bedazzled pacifiers made for her (nuke nipple - and they were quite the investment) and she will not use them, only nanob\u00e8b\u00e8. Unfortunately my breast feeding journey came to an end sooner than I had hoped but the stars aligned and nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 came out with this flexible silicon bottle that same week! While I still use the boob bottles, the flexible silicon bottles are easy for all five grandparents and husband to use. They are soft and easy for baby to hold. They have three vents making it easy for long feedings. I ordered another set of the silicon bottles to round out our collection and we now have 12 bottles (because my goodness we go through so many bottles!). I cannot say enough good things about nanob\u00e9b\u00e9 from the pacifiers, cooler (we use the boob bottles in the cooler on trips), sterilizer, drying rack, original boob bottle, and now the flexible silicon bottles. When I was breast feeding the storage bags and storage containers were wonderful. Easy and organized storage in the fridge and the bags are STURDY! As an extra, extra dose of awesomeness they are easy to clean and can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher (score!) and come in pink! \ud83d\ude0d I recommend nanob\u00e8b\u00e8 everything to anyone who asks and am looking forward to seeing what comes next from this awesome company.",

                "reviewText": "My baby has always been a *terrible* eater. Refused to breastfeed until 2 months, choked and aspirated EVERY SINGLE BOTTLE we've given her, had constant hiccups and spit-up, and it would take an hour to feed her.This bottle? I bought it on a whim because I liked their competitors, but hated the high price and noticed reviews mentioning mold issues under any of the ones that had fixed plastic rims around the silicone, so I looked elsewhere and found these.Oh my God.Her meals? Down from an hour to maxing out at 15 mins.Her choking? Non-existent.Her reflux and spit-up? Extremely reduced.Now let's talk about the bottles themselves;They're soft and she likes to hold them unlike any of the other more conventional ones we've tried. If you have a lot of them in your sink they might bounce around while you wash them (which is kinda funny tbh). The support ring around the silicone detaches so the mold issue I saw with the more expensive ones are non-existant. I'm not sure how, but all the plastic parts rinse off super easily so you're not making multiple passes under the water trying to get soap residue off (seriously). The caps stay on well enough if you push them down correctly but are also pretty easy to remove as well, which is great because I have health issues which cause muscle weakness and chronic pain and I would very literally have to find someone to ask for help to get the cap off of other brands I've tried. There's no internal pieces or parts so you don't have to stand there and detail 8 million little anti-colic-bottle-straw-vent-baggies-whatever with a tiny brush all day. I've had absolutely no leaking with any of them, even with them being squeezed or assembled by my decently clumsy husband. And the best part? For these types of bottles, they're really cheap.If you're on the fence about these, I highly recommend. It solved a good chunk of my kid's feeding issues basically overnight WITHOUT breaking the bank.",

If you're doing formula and stuff and just using hot water then I might work better but then again what's the point of getting a \"breastfeeding\" bottle if your not breastfeeding? the baby will take just fine to a normal bottle/nipple. The quality is good and pretty easy to clean. they just don't work for me personally.",
