        "description": "Inspired by moms and designed by experts, our Closer to Nature Baby Bottle has an extra-wide neck and breast-like nipple to help your baby have the most natural bottle-feeding experience. Made from super soft silicone, the nipple has a special breast-like shape that encourages a natural latch and prevents nipple confusion when switching between bottle and breast. This works by mimicking the flex and movement of moms breast, allowing your baby to feed at a pace that feels comfortable and natural to them. It also features an anti-colic valve to prevent the symptoms of colic by ensuring your little one ingests more milk and less air. For added peace of mind, the Closer to Nature baby bottle is completely mess-free and leakproof when the screw ring, nipple and cap are all secured (even if its turned upside down or shaken). Its also 100% BPA free so its safe for your baby. Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature baby bottles are available in a wide range of sizes, colors and decorations. This bottle comes with a slow flow nipple thats suitable for 0+ months. Nipples are available in a range of flow rates too, so the milk can flow faster as your baby gets hungrier! However you choose to feed your baby - whether its breast milk, formula or a bit of both - our Closer to Nature Anti-Colic bottles are #1 for easily switching between bottle and breast*. *Based on an independent survey of 1,006 UK moms of 0-12m who have used bottles, Feb 2023 **Based on an independent survey of 153 UK moms of 0-3m, currently use TT & used within last week, Feb 2023",

                "reviewText": "For breastfeeding mommies who are worried about nipple shape, air bubbles, etc... This bottle has a very alluring design that could solve some feeding issues. I can't say it solved anything for us since our baby seemed pretty indifferent to the type of nipple, experienced no nipple confusion with any bottle, and the flow cause the same reaction as other nipples (for new born.)I like them enough to rate them 4/5 stars.Pros:+Shape is similar to breast.+Nipple is ambitiously different than many other too brands.+Didn't notice a negative impact on level of air baby took in. Seemed about average/expected.+Easy to clean.+Price was fair for 4 bottles.Soft-cons (more like opportunities to improve:)-The nipple sometimes bends/indents so I have to pull it out and try again.-The capacity of the bottle is decent, but the bottle is wide. I doesn't fit in our Dr. Brown's bottle warmer but fits in our momcozy one.-I have to lean the baby back quite a bit to empty the bottle. Anyone with a spitty baby knows that tilting the baby back is playing with fire.-This nipple is so big it sometimes takes me a couple of tries to get it into the ring that screws onto the bottle.-The cap is almost impossible to get off if not screwed into the bottle.",
