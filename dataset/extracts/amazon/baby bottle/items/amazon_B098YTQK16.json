        "description": "Philips Avent Glass Natural bottle with the Natural Response nipple lets baby control the pace of the milk, like they do when breastfeeding. The nipples' unique opening and tip only releases milk when your baby actively drinks. When pausing to swallow and breathe no milk flows. Baby can drink, swallow, and breathe using their natural rhythm, just like they do when breastfeeding. Easily combine breast and bottle feeding with a wide breast-shaped nipple with a soft feel that mimics the shape and feel of a breast; plus baby controlling the flow of milk like they do when breastfeeding. The nipple has a no-drip design which helps prevent lost milk from the tip. An anti-colic valve integrated into the nipple is designed to reduce colic and discomfort by sending air away from your baby's tummy. The ergonomic shape makes it comfortable for parents to hold. Assembly is simple with only a few parts and the wide bottle neck makes filling and cleaning easy. This Natural Philips Avent bottle is made of premium quality borosilicate glass, a BPA free material. It is heat and thermal shock resistant, so it can be safely stored in the fridge, warmed and is easy to wash and sterilize. The Natural response nipples come in flow rates 1-5. Use the Philips Avent Natural baby bottle with Philips Avent Natural bottle nipples. Includes: 1 8oz Glass Natural bottle with Natural Response nipple flow 3. SCY913/01 What to expect when introducing the Philips Avent Natural Response Nipple It is totally natural for your baby to take 2-3 tries to get milk flowing from a new bottle. Unlike traditional bottles the Natural bottle is designed to only release milk when your baby is actively drinking, like what happens when babies breastfeed. We have 5 different nipple flow rates for the Natural bottle. When looking for the right nipple flow rate, age is a guide, but your baby's approach to drinking and the feeding cues they will show will help determine when to move to a higher or lower nipple flow rate.",

It takes a shorter time to rinse them clean; I feel like soap residue is harder to clean out of plastic bottles.They are quite sturdy, but even so, I wanted to be extra-sure that they wouldn't break. I ordered some silicone sleeves for them and it's a perfect combo. Even with the sleeves, they can still fit in a beverage holder in the car.These are definitely heavier than plastic bottles, so that is something to keep in mind.I really like these bottles for their cleanliness and my baby loves them for eating, so these are a win-win for us!",

                "reviewText": "My 6 month old preferred Mam bottles from the start but I was looking for a nontoxic, plastic free option. After trying a few I landed on these Avent glass bottles.He took to the nipple shape immediately & was very successful with them. He struggled a bit with other nipple shapes due to a tongue tie. He went from struggling to eat, to drinking so comfortably & at ease.The glass bottle itself is very high quality, easy to clean, and well worth the money. Will be purchasing more to have on hand",

We haven't had any nipple confusion, the glass actually feels very light weight, they are super easy to clean, and you can hear the air bubbles leaving the bottle (through the hole in the nipple) as they drink. We bought so many of these and use them both for feeding and storing milk. Love them.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these before my baby was born because my other child grew up on Dr. Browns. Most people will tell you Dr. Browns are a hassle to clean, which I agree with. \"Hassle\" is putting it mildly.Consider what goes into cleaning five Dr. Brown bottles:5 parts/bottle * Interior + Exterior (2 surfaces), of which one piece has two separate interiors: 11 washing operations per bottle.These operations require separate washing tools (Bottle brush, small wire brush, sponge) if you hand wash them.5 bottles * 11 washing operations = 55 separate motions using 3 different tools.Unless you stick it all in the dishwasher, which will leave the bottles tasting like Comet (or whatever dishwasher tab you use).I hand washed all my Dr. Browns. You get used to the complexity of the operation, but still, I don't think anyone enjoys the time loss, especially when they are pressed for time, raising a newborn.That said, I was really looking forward to using the AVents, because glass is awesome (recyclable, doesn't retain flavor), and their construction/care is simple. These are definitely heavier than a plastic bottle, but I'm fine with that trade-off. The only tricky issue with them are the nipple flow rates.Ideally, one would progress through the recommended rates (sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first is supposed to mimic a natural breast flow, and thus, be the most difficult to suck from. But what if your baby has never been breast fed? Or, what if the nursing unit gave them a Dr. Browns (very fast flowing compared with the Phillips) from the start and they got used to that?My baby was both (not breast fed and was given Dr. Browns from the start by the nursing staff while in ICU), thus, was used to a faster-flowing nipple than the Phillips AVent 1's . I believe that's why they initially didn't want to take to the AVents. When I considered the problem, I switched to a 3 and sure enough, they took to the AVents. Lesson learned: you may have to experiment with different nipple flow rates to get the right flow for your baby.Outside of that little hurdle, I absolutely love these. There might be other good brands (I hear good things about the MAM's), but these are outstanding and I see no reason to look further.",
