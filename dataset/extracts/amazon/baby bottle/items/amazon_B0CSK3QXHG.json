The leakage can be avoided by doubling up the sealing rings, one clear one and one pink one, for the Avent bottles. The pink sealing rings work perfectly for the Spectra pump bottles.

Use the BLUE rings for Avent bottles and always make sure they\u2019re on before using. I pump directly into the Avent bottles and then use these caps. Easy peasy!",
