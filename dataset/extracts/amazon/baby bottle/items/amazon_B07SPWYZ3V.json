Continuous and prolonged sucking of fluids will cause tooth decay. Always check food temperature beforefeeding. Always check the nipples for signs of wear and replace when damaged. Do not use a microwave oven to heat the bottle because microwave ovens can create hotspots in milk/formula orbottle components. The components of this bottle are not toys and should not be given to children to play with or suck on. Do not leave the product in direct sunlight or heat or leave in disinfectant (sterilizing solution) for longer than recommended, as this may weaken the nipple. Change nipples after approximately 6 weeks of use. When used and sterilized intensively, nipples may deteriorate after 6 weeks. Do not allow a child to walk or run while using this bottle. CAUTION: Remove the bottle from your baby\u2019s mouth when the baby is not feeding. Do not let a child take a bottle to bed or self-feed for long periods. Prolonged contact with milk, formula, and other liquids can cause tooth decay. Allowing your child to use this product for prolonged periods separate from regular mealtimes or to go to sleep while drinking liquids, other than water, from this baby bottle may cause or contribute to early childhood tooth decay. Be sure to contact your physician should you have any feeding problems or questions."

                "reviewText": "After 3 generations of using Playtex bottles with liners, Playtex decided to stop manufacturing the liners. Playtex was the only bottle we could use for my grandson that he didn't immediately throw up every single feeding. Went to order more drop ins last month only to find out they stopped making them. We have tried so many anti colic bottles in 10 months that I didn't have much hope for these Momma Bear bottles. I have been pleasantly surprised by them. My grandson took to them right away and no vomiting after a bottle. The only downside that we've encountered is the ring. You really have to screw that thing on tight or a 10 month old will get it and the nipple right off. Other than that the bottle holds up well. I toss them in the dishwasher without problems and my grandson chucks them across the room without breakage or leakage. Much better quality and price than the Walmart brand and Nuk.",
