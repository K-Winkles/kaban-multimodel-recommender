The fit was great and they've survived hundreds of sanitize cycles in the dishwasher.They are usually easiest to slip on the bottle immediately after warming since steam or immersion warming will wet the outside of the bottle. Later removal can be tough if there's no longer any moisture trapped between the sleeve and bottle (but a pass under the faucet and exposing some part of the sleeve can allow you to eventually work the sleeve back off).",

                "reviewText": "The sleeve fits very well on the Avent glass bottle by Philips. The instructions tell you to wet the glass and the sleeve before applying which makes it much easier. Pull it on by the shoulder, but dont pull on the cut outs because they might rip. You can also help slide it on by pushing and sliding up from the bottom. The translucent colour is preferable because you can see the bottle markings through it, but the cutout designs are placed to make the markings visible anyway.",

Mostly invisible which I prefer over all the usually colorful baby stuff on the market.Stays in baby\u2019s hands and baby can\u2019t remove it. Keeps bottle from getting too hot to the touch in the warmer.Don\u2019t Like:It\u2019s so delicate! I\u2019ve torn two and these are pricey to keep replacing! So I won\u2019t be replacing anymore. They are just too expensive for what they are.Removing and reattaching is usually difficult. The bottle in the video is wet. But it is still tedious work removing and reattaching this very delicate silicone. It tears where the cut outs are obviously. if you\u2019re rushing, this is easily going to happen. Also tears if your bottle is dropped. It will be dropped.Lower the price or make stronger. Then maybe I\u2019ll buy more!",
