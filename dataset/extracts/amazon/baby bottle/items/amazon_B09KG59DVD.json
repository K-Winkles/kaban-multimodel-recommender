The soft silicone nipple encourages your little one to feed using the same technique as they do on your breast. Using the same muscles and sucking motion makes it far less likely your baby will refuse the bottle or the breast. In fact, the intricate way in which your baby feeds on the Minbie, actually nurtures their instinctive breastfeeding latch making them a more effective feeder! Strengthens Bonds Life is busier than ever before and choosing to feed your baby with our Minbie nipple means you aren\u2019t doing it alone. You can breastfeed your precious bub together with a bottle feeding system that delivers peace of mind. Minbie protects your breastfeeding on the days you need to hand over, the moments you need a breather, the afternoons you need a nap and the occasions when someone else wants all those beautiful baby bonding moments you\u2019ve been enjoying! Anti Reflux & Colic The intricate design of the Minbie nipple is what makes it anti colic & anti reflux. It\u2019s a total rethink of the baby bottle nipple. The complexity of newborn feeding demands a nipple that perfectly matches the way newborns want and need to feed on the breast. By introducing the Minbie nipple to your breastfeeding routine your little one will use instinct to latch correctly, making it less likely they\u2019ll ingest air through the sides of their mouth, therefore avoiding colic and reflux. Protects Your Baby Babies who feed from the Minbie are practicing their instinctive breastfeeding muscle-memory and therefore avoiding nipple confusion and lazy latching. They\u2019re practicing to latch properly onto the breast and to work for the feed with their complex breastfeeding technique. This exact technique is what evolution provided for our babies, for their very survival, and it\u2019s the best for protecting the longevity of the mother-baby breastfeeding relationship.",

Durable PPSU has a far greater shatter resistance than any other plastic.

                "reviewText": "I originally wanted to purchase the complete Minbie set but talked myself out of it why spend the money being a 2nd time mum. By the time I purchased everything in that kit in other brands I had nearly spent the same amount of money if not more.. bib refused everything.. one night at midnight I made the courageous decision to just order a Minbie bundle at this stage only now 6weeks away from returning to work I NEED her to take a bottle. First bottle BOOM she played with it but gave it a few sucks everything from the email I received from the CEO at 1220am personally asking about my situation that made me feel instant relief I had made the right choice. After a week of on and off taking and refusing the support documents available through Minbie kept me going trying different positions different temps.. now 4 weeks out from returning to work I now need to order more bottles so we have enough for daycare.. MINBIE FOR THE WIN ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER.. also ordered days prior to Christmas they dispatched it first thing that morning and was to me before Christmas absolutely outstanding customer service and quality products.. I can't wait to rave about you to anyone who will ask aswell as my blogs. I honestly don't think this would have been possible without the Minbie products.",

                "reviewText": "Read entire review for hope!My 3 almost 4 month old wasn\u2019t exposed to the bottle enough! I was way too focused on securing breastfeeding. By the time I actually needed to bottle feed, she went through refusal for weeks. I \u201cbottle trained\u201d for weeks using Avent, Dr browns, Tommie tippie & NOTHING WORKED! Finally the brand she did favor was NUK natural. But, the flow was slow. When I discovered this bottle it was perfect. She still fusses a bit before receiving & then latches right on !HOW DID I DO IT ?I had to be strong ebf was causing problems in my relationship & mental health. I offered the bottle (same nuk bottle) around the clock. I didn\u2019t give her my boob once. Did she cry a terrible cry? YES Was it for more than 5 minutes? MAYBE Was it through more than one feeding period ? YES After \u201ccrying it out\u201d she finally latched on.Again this method is what worked for me.I did make the mistake and expose her to my breast again at night because I was lazy, but it set me back traumatically. (I think it confuses an exclusively breast fed baby) I wish I could do both, but I recommend doing strictly bottle for a few weeks before trying to expose baby to both. As of now I\u2019m able to bottle feed during day & Breast feed @night. It took a couple while for her to get adjusted to the schedule.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t typically review products but I really had to for moms that are in the same boat as me. I tried every bottle under the sun. Even the bottle that LOOKS like a breast. My baby refused every single bottle until I found this one. He is 8 months old and exclusively bf up until now, and finally takes a bottle thanks to this company. I purchased another whole set from their website after I bought this one. Very thankful I found this. Definitely a bottle for breastfed babies! Don\u2019t hesitate they are worth every dollar.",

My baby who refuses a bottle did latch on for a few seconds, but it was never long enough to give it a good shot. The flow really seemed too strong. I tried pace feeding and made sure to follow the directions but the flow seemed too much and my baby is just at a point where he refuses any bottle.",
