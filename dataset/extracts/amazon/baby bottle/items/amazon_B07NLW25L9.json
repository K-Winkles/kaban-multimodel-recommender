Hey will leak. And u can't hear in a bottle warmer.. But that's what I've had to use with her since she was about 2 weeks old So I've been using the Playtex bottle with drop in liners since the fulls size nipple fits both type of Playtex bottles.She has stomach issues and has to use the liquid ready to feed alimentum gross stuffWe have to heat her bottles to room temp at least. The liquid formula has to be kept refrigerated. It's terrible to travel with lolIf I use the vent aire it will leak, if I use the bagged bottles they are hard to heat while out. Can't make bottles to put in fridge for the night feedings or u have to pour them into something else to heat then back in the bottle with bag.Why my baby gotta be so picky \ud83d\ude2dNot even kidding I have every major bottle. Brand out here. Standard nipple to wide. I've spent a few hundred on bottles trying to get her to take a diff typeThen I came across a comment that said Playtex nipples would fit in Dr browns options wide neck \ud83d\ude4c thank u Jesus!So we travel with this type and I can make a bottle up for the fridge and heat it in the same bottle when she's ready to eat.I know this post is long and may not help one other person lol but just incase there's someone's googling for days what bottle ring will fit Playtex nipple here u go! Thankful for that one person's comment on another site for this info.* The regular dr browns wide neck bottle that has the blue air tube will not work with Playtex nipples. I ordered both because she didn't specify which wide neck those nipples worked with. Has to be the options plus with the green tube thing.",

When my son was born, he tried several different brands of bottles (Avent, MAM, etc). He didn\u2019t like any of them. I ordered this one, and he took to it right away! The nipple is pretty soft, and it\u2019s a larger size (probably feels more like a nipple does when he breastfeeds so he likes it). It also is anti-colic, which is great because it takes out all the air bubbles. My son would eat very quickly and get lots of gas in his tummy, and it would hurt him. It stopped once he started drinking from this bottle.Overall, 100% recommend! But Dr. Brown bottles form the start, you won\u2019t regret it :)",

                "reviewText": "I got this bottle when my 4-month old had forgotten how to use a bottle and I have compared it to the narrower Dr. Brown bottles and Mam bottles. I tried the Mam bottles, thinking their vent system must compare to the Dr. Brown bottles, but I hated them. Their vent system only worked when the bottle had a bit of a vacuum already, so the nipple kept collapsing, making my son stop eating to let air come in through the nipple tip. In comparison to the usual Dr. Brown bottles, there are pros and cons. Both have excellent venting systems, are not too hard to clean, and only occasionally leak a little. The wide bottle does not connect to my medela breast milk pump, which detracts from it's claim of being designed with breastfeeding in mind. More milk can pool in the edge of the wider bottle and even the nipple (pictured), so you have to tip it vertical to get all of the milk out at the end of the feed. However, with the narrower Dr. Brown bottle nipples, my son's lip ends up on the nipple ring (pictured) instead of entirely on the nipple. He doesn't seem to mind, but I think that would be uncomfortable. I want an adapter for the wide nipple with the narrower bottle.",

Even though our baby doesn't even drink more than 4 ounces of formula, some of the bottles still leak from where the \"screw ring\" screws on to the bottle base. Which is odd because you would think that they would have a better quality control at the factory where they manufacture these bottles... but it is what it is I guess... it seems like the old school bottles were made of better quality than this new plastic stuff. I guess it's true what they say: \"They don't make them like they used to.\"",
