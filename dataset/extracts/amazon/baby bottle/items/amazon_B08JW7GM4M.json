                "reviewText": "We purchased this to clean baby-related items especially because it says that it's good for cleaning milk residues. My experience with many gentle cleansing products is that they are not that good when it comes to cleaning, but this product is effective even though it's gentle.I usually prefer scented items. The Apple Pear scent is okay. It's very mild, so the scent would likely not be offensive to those sensitive to fragrance. I think it's not a good combination for this product though, and the Unscented one seems better.",

You only need a dabble (or a dapple\ud83d\ude05) of this to make it sud up nicely, it removes formula film and leaves things squeaky clean- I only wish it came with a pump vs squeezing the bottle itself since the soap is a tad thick although I don\u2019t have a genuine complaint about the thickness.I purchased non scented rest assured it does not leave the bottles with any formula scent and honestly smells clean.Overall this may be my new go to!",
