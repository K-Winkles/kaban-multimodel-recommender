I wanted something that would be kind of like his bottle even though he wasn't much of bottle kid he liked it for milk once I put him on cows milk. These cups are great easy to use, easy to clean and he hold them with no problem. It doesn't leak so far unless I fill it too much. I ended up telling a friend about these cups for her kid and she ordered them too! They're great and I know Ill be buying them again!!",

We originally bought the dr browns transitional cup with straw but you have to suck pretty hard to get water out so it didn\u2019t work well for our daughter. With this transitional cup, my daughter was able to catch on quickly. Other positives are it\u2019s really easy to clean, doesn\u2019t leak, has a top to cover the mouth piece when not in use and comes with flexible handles for easy grip. The only con is my daughter is still too young to hold the bottle and tilt it up to drink from if the bottle is filled up.",
