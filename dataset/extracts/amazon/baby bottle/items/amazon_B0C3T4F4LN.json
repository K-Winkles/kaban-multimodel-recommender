                "reviewText": "The idea is great and it frees up both hands if done correctly. Three main problems I run into: 1. for smaller babies - under 10 lbs - the fit is too loose and the baby can dilodge the bottle from their mouth. 2. For shorter bottles Avent natural flows 4oz ( which i suggest the larger versions to avoid leaks and overfeeding with this product) are too short to work properly so i suggest sizing up. 3. Set up is difficult. BUT if you get it right, you can finally free up your hands to get stuff done!",

                "reviewText": "It seems big but my baby is small so hopefully she'll grow into it. There are a few things that aren't said that needed to work. The baby needs to be inclined at least 30 degrees so hopefully you have a wedge pillow (in which case I did) otherwise find a pillow to create an incline. Secondly, the elastic band seems to fit slim/long bottles and it was difficult to squeeze in my newborn's fat Philips Advent Natural bottle and when I did get it in it was a little too short for my baby to reach the nip. The idea is great but not universal for bottles so I'll just stick with folding a towel underneath for now. Good thing is that this is machine washable on the delicate cycle. It's cute but overall I would rate it a 3.8 stars just because there's conditional requirements for this to work.",
