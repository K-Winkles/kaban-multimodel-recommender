Because of this, I find myself not using them as much as I was hoping because it\u2019s time consuming (when baby is hungry, there\u2019s no time, iykyk). For these reasons I removed 1 star.

                "reviewText": "These were perfect for my baby to grasp and I think it really helped him out in holding bottles up to drink since he learned how to use it pretty quickly. I've tried this on various bottles and it definitely has a harder time with the fatter non-thin bottles (I did manage to make it work though). If you keep that in mind, the thinner bottles definitely work great with this product.",
