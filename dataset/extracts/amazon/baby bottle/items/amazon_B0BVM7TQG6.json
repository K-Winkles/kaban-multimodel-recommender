                "reviewText": "Choosing glass baby bottles has been a game-changer for my little one, and these particular bottles have exceeded my expectations. The material feels sturdy, and I appreciate the reassurance of using a non-toxic and BPA-free option. The clear glass design allows for easy monitoring of formula or breast milk levels, and they are a breeze to clean. The silicone sleeves not only add a stylish touch but also provide a secure grip, reducing the chances of accidental slips. Transitioning from plastic to glass has been a positive move for our family, and these bottles have become a reliable and safe choice for feeding time. Highly recommended for parents prioritizing both safety and aesthetics.",

Fortunately, I found these and love the size and shape and that they are mushrooms, so cute! I was a bit surprised how big the cap was, but it doesn\u2019t affect anything. Baby is already 10 months but I use them during the times he\u2019s more likely to not drink much, so the size is good.I just wish they had the cap color in yellow for the small ones. And the red ones to be actual red and not looking pink.",
