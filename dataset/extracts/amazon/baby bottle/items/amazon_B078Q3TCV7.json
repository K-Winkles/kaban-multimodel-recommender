                "reviewText": "These are the perfect bottles for our baby. He has a mild lip tie which the pediatrician said we don\u2019t need to correct, but it was enough to make nursing directly from the breast impossible and finding the right bottle difficult. First, we tried the Comotomo ones we had been gifted and that was a no go because those are actually terrible for latching. They claim to be \u201cbreast like\u201d but nobody\u2019s breast is actually shaped like that while nursing and the baby ends up just sucking on that nipple like it\u2019s a straw - definitely didn\u2019t work for our guy. Next, we tried the Dr. Browns with the wide neck (I had gotten a sample in my Amazon registry box). The wide neck meant the nipple base was still too wide for our guy to latch really well, but they worked okay. Then I ordered the standard neck Dr. Brown\u2019s, which worked pretty well. He still had some leaking issues because I got the sense there wasn\u2019t enough of a nipple base to get a good latch. Then we tried the Evenflo Balance Plus standard neck bottles. I\u2019d seen people raving about them on the internet. I think they are actually the most breast-like bottles I\u2019ve seen, but for our guy that just meant the latch was uncomfortably wide and he crushed the nipple, just like when he did to my nipples when trying to nurse. I did like the fact that the vent was part of the nipple, though. Finally, I found these. They had the same vent design as the other Evenflo bottles, but had a nipple closer to the standard Dr. Brown\u2019s, though with a more substantial nipple base. Now, our little dude eats so efficiently, doesn\u2019t lose a drop out of the sides of his mouth, and latches so well! And we don\u2019t have to worry about cleaning those 2 extra pieces for each Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle.Anyway, TLDR: best bottle ever for a little dude with a lip tie.",

                "reviewText": "My little guy came home on the ready to us Enfamil bottles with the latex nipples. We were using those until he's gotten to 7 weeks. He was very picky when we tried to change him from ready to use formula and steering away from the latex. We got Dr. Browns, Advent, and Mam bottles and he HATED them all. So I continued with the little 2 oz pre-mades but he is growing and needing more food and the pre-made is so much more expensive. I was desperate so I looked up bottles to transition to from latex nipples and these popped up. Switched to these and its been night and day! Love the size, the cute colors, and while at first I was putting pre-made formula in them he is now happy and I switched to powder with no issues. So glad I stumbled upon these! You can also use the latex nipples in these if you want but he didn't even mind the ones they came with. The only con is that its hard to read the measurement on the side but it's not a huge deal.",

                "reviewText": "Great bottles. Our baby got used to the Evenflo nipples they provide in the hospital but was not responding well to the nipples that mimic a natural nipple when we got home. These bottles are similar to the hospital issued ones and encourage a deep latch so going between bottle and breast has been easy. Would 100% recommend.",

The one piece vented nipple make it super easy to clean, no other parts to keep track of and after using these, baby didn\u2019t go back to his previous bottles he had been using. And ordering the medium flow nipples from Evenflow\u2019s site was super easy and a drop in replacement for the slow flows.",

After I contacted the seller they made it right and sent it to me! I\u2019m impressed. And the bottles both these plastic ones and the glass ones are great. But bigger nipples when needed at evenflo feeding website. My ibclc approved and they work great.",
