                "reviewText": "Our favorite straw cup by far! I have 16-month-old twins and they use these bottles for water for every meal/snack. They are super cute but also very user-friendly. I love that they are clear so you can see how much liquid is inside, and absolutely LOVE the ounce-markings on the side. They hold quite a bit and are very hardy, as they have survived MANY (and I mean A LOT) throws/drops on the ground. The cute little design on the bottle has also held up very well to numerous hand-washings every day. They are leak-proof when the lid is closed, and I love that it's a one-piece lid that is easy to clean and great for travel/outings. The straw comes in 2 pieces, so there are a total of 4 parts to wash--bottle, lid, and 2 straw parts. It sounds like a lot but it's not that bad at all. It also comes with an extra straw top in case your kid chews the first piece to oblivion (I haven't had to use the spare part yet). The straw is fairly narrow but the standard straw brush for sippy cups should be sufficient. I just dismantle and throw all the parts in warm soapy water to soak at the end of the day and it works very well (but keep in mind I use these only for water--other liquids might need more of a scrub). No handles, but my 16-month-olds have been using these since before they turned 1, and they haven't had any problems holding them. Sometimes water will come spewing out of the straw after the cup has been stored with the lid closed for a while, but this wasn't a big deal for me--the other features of the cup have heavily outweighed that little nitpick for me (but again--this is no big deal for water but milk or juice might be a different story for others). Love Green Sprouts products.",

This cup doesn't restrict water flow like other cups, so it's easy to get water out of. The straw is also thin enough that my baby doesn't get too much all at once. He started using this one at around 10 months, but I wish I would have found it sooner!",

                "reviewText": "We do mostly BLW with our 8 month old. I wanted to skip the sippy cup phase and teach him how to use a straw. He already wants to sip from my adult water tumbler, so I didn\u2019t want a bottle that restricts the flow. How will babies learn if they struggle to get the liquid out? Sure babies will make a mess with it more free flowing, but this is exactly what I wanted. I figured he will simply learn quicker this way.We taught our son at 7 months how to use a straw with the honey bear squeeze cups. We then moved to this one, and he instantly picked up on how to drink from it (you can\u2019t squeeze it). I didn\u2019t want anything that was \u201cleak proof\u201d because I didn\u2019t want my son to have to bite down or suck hard in order to drink.Another pro is that it is very few pieces so it\u2019s relatively easy to clean. It holds quite a bit compared to some others. Since he\u2019s so young we don\u2019t give him very much, but once he can have more water it\u2019ll be nice to have. I also love that the ounces are marked on the side. This is especially helpful since he\u2019s so young, and we do track how much we give him since milk is still his main source of nutrition.I also think the simple design is cute. I prefer more simple/minimal designs, and a lot of children\u2019s products are way over the top.Since my son is quite young he still struggles a bit to hold it himself, but he is learning. There is a small dip in the middle to help them hold it easier.We plan to eventually get the green one for milk/juice and keep this one just for water. I highly recommend!",

We currently use it for our 19 month old with the tippy straw option although it comes with the normal straw option as well. Great price on amazon- especially for the blue whale cup.",

My 11 month old does well with the munchkin 360 but I wanted to get him on straws before we have to transition off his bottles. I tried SO many straw cups and he couldn\u2019t really figure them out, I think because they took too much work to suck because of the \u2018spill proof\u2019 features. It was hard to find a cup that wasn\u2019t totally open but also easy to suck! This works great! Getting another! Also easy to clean, and it barely leaks even when the straw is open since the liquid moves away from the bottom of the straw when it\u2019s upside down- fab so far!",

                "reviewText": "Received our first one as a gift and my daughter has taken to the straw very well. She started drinking from it very early (maybe 6-7 months) and people were surprised she could use it so well at such a young age. I think the design makes it possible for babies to learn to drink through a straw. She prefers this cup over the transition sippy cups with the silicone tops. We left ours at a restaurant so I immediately order two more! I love that you can close the top and that it comes with an extra straw piece. I'm surprised more people haven't tried or reviewed this cup!Tip: when putting the straw back into the cap, push it in and then PULL it from the top and it will snap right back in. Maybe this is obvious to some but wanted to share :)",
