                "reviewText": "I have always had Kenmore\u2019s & grew up with them. When my last Kenmore canister stopped working after about 15 years, I moved into my 1069 sq house & decided I should try the Shark bagless upright & it was always so dirty & gross to empty. Had it for 5 - 6 years & it stopped working. I am NOT a fan of bagless & I also have a German Shepherd so I need some serious suction. When I saw this Kenmore I decided there is something to be said about good old fashioned bags & the suction power of a Kenmore. As predicted, the vacuum works great & I appreciate the longer cord. My house is 1069 sq & I used an outlet located in the center of my house & the vacuum reaches everywhere without having to unplug it. It was also easy to assemble. I also LOVE the lift away feature. My Shark had that feature & I am really glad I did not have to compromise that because it\u2019s very practical & makes things easier.I give it 5 stars for suction, comfort, and price, but am giving it 4 stars because it needs a couple of more design features but nothing that is a deal breaker:1. I wish there were a separate floor piece so I can lift away the unit to get under hard to reach spots with just the pipe. It comes with attachments but they are not floor pieces but they will be good for other hard to reach spots.2. Attachments don\u2019t stay on unit well or at least they don\u2019t seem to.2. There is a weird whistle sound coming from the vacuum when it\u2019s on.This vacuum is still a keeper & I\u2019m happy to be using a bagged vacuum again. It\u2019s much more clean & sterile.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good Vacuum and Value",
                "reviewText": "I bought the vacuum for my 75-year-old mother. Her other vacuums are heavy and not easy to lug around. She didn't like the dust plume from emptying dust cups, plus one of them died after only two years of use. I asked her how she liked the Kenmore so far, so this review is based off of what she told me and my observations of watching her use it.Kenmore Intuition Upright Bagged Vacuum Cleaner with HEPA FilteringPros: Very good suction, comparable to my mom's Meile, which had a price tag of $600. It pulls the tuft of the carpet up nicely, and you can hear dirt and other objects being sucked up, even more so than the other vacs my mom has, including her Meile. You can turn the brush roller off for hard floors. The swiveling head is a very handy feature, so you can get hard-to-reach areas just fine. The wheels and power head did not appear to scratch wood floors or leave scuff marks, which was a good thing. The very lightweight and the detachable canister is easy to carry around, while using the various cleaning attachments and when it is attached to the power head, the unit is easy to push and pull. The pet/upholstery tool works well on carpets and upholstery. It has an actual brush roller and not a single molded piece of plastic. You don't need to press down hard on the tool while cleaning. Pressing down on any attachment like that will prevent it from performing as intended. It will even clean heavy coats with fur or hair on them - my mom adjusted the suction slider on the handle to a level that would prevent damaging the fabric. The hose and wand are long enough to get to many hard-to-reach areas overhead and under tables, couches, chairs, and so forth. The power cord is long enough you don't have to relocate it to a closer outlet as often, particularly when you have to go up and down a bunch of stairs and don't want to go down to find a closer outlet and then go back up to the vacuum. The bags are durable and easy to eject into the garbage with very little dust blowback. My mom likes to fill bags to the point of bursting, but I did not notice any seams coming loose on the bag she had. I also noticed there was very little dust inside the bag containment area. There is no need to touch a bag during ejection but hold on to the bottom of the shroud while it releases. Releasing a full bag is not completely dust-free, but it is nothing compared to dust cups, which can spew up a large cloud of dust. With the Kenmore, my mom does not have to go outside to empty a dust cup, so that is a convenience in my view. The bags are also easy to replace - a new bag just slips into grooves in the plastic holder, and you snap the shroud back on the canister. The HEPA filter is easily accessible and replaceable. I am unsure whether it is a true HEPA filter or not. It removed a lot of dust particles, as observed from how dirty a used one appeared, so the vacuum does not recirculate a bunch of particulates back into the air. At least I didn't notice a dust smell or sneeze while the vacuum was in use. The user manual that comes with the vacuum is easy to follow and not convoluted in any way.Cons: I wouldn't call them \"cons\" as much as slight inconveniences. When you pull the vacuum back, sometimes the power head will lift off of the floor. I believe that is attributable to how quickly one pulls it back. If you pull it back more slowly, there is no lift off issue. The wand/canister release and seating procedure can be cumbersome, but there is a little foot symbol on the power head, which I concluded to be where you place your foot to hold the power head down while releasing the wand and/or canister. Seating the canister takes some training, as the wand needs to be attached to the canister to place back on the power head and guiding it back on is kind of tricky. The vacuum is loud, but it's not the loudest I have heard. My mom's Meile does have a noise adjustment feature, so that is one advantage it has over the Kenmore. There is no height adjustment on the power head, but Cheerios, Fruit Loops, and most dog food are picked up just fine. If you need to vacuum up bigger pieces, just lift the power head up and place back down on the debris. You cannot push the unit under some things, due to the size of the canister; however, that is what the attachments are for. No big deal, in my view. My mom just used the pet/upholstery cleaner to get under couches, chairs, coffee tables, etc. on carpeted surfaces. The other attachments she used on hard floors. The power cord is not retractable. Her Meile and her other operational vacuum do have a retractable power cord. She did not see that as a huge issue, she just made a loop and hung it on the upper cord hook. When one does wrap the cord up on the hooks, don't do it so tightly that the hooks are difficult to twist down or up. The hose will need to be stretched out a few times before it finally reaches desired elasticity. I attribute that to the vacuum being new and part of the breaking-in process.Overall, the Kenmore Intuition is a very good vacuum and a good value for the features it has. I compared it to a $600 Meile canister vac, and it stood up to the Meile very well. I think it had more features than the Meile, to be honest.EDIT: The foot symbol on the powerhead is also the place to hold it down while pulling the handle and canister back before cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this vacuum cleaner after my (very heavy) 15-year-old Eureka Boss quit working. I was skeptical based on the price, but after using this vacuum for 3 weeks on a variety of surfaces I am 100% satisfied. We have two dogs and a long-haired cat so I need to vacuum 3-4 times a week on hardwood, area rugs, ceramic tile, furniture, and three flights of stairs. I love how light it is and now that I am used to the swivel head, which took a few uses, I find myself looking for more reasons to pull it out of the closet. My favorite features of the Kenmore are: the left up/disconnect from base (making vacuuming stairs super easy), the long cord, the excellent suction & suction control, the push button release for the wand, the layers of Hepa filtration, and the fact the roller brush stops when in the upright position. Several aspects I began to appreciate upon first use, which are better than the Eureka: I can get under the couch and other furniture further, the swivel head allows me to vacuum a large area with a twist of the wrist, and the headlight is bright. It did tip over a couple times, but that was my bad/not paying attention when using the hose. I do have to store one of the three attachments separately, but that alone is not a big deal especially considering all the pros on my personal list. I read in several reviews that the attachments tend to fall off when stored on the unit, but that has not happened. I anticipate liking the no-touch bag release but have not needed to change out our bag yet.",

The bags are surprisingly good quality and it comes with 7, one in the vacuum and 6 extras. Would highly recommend for cleaning medium size spaces.

I've tried Dyson, Shark, and Bissell and been very let down with the suction power (especially compared to the price). This vacuum is exactly what I wanted!It's much lighter than the old Kenmore Intuition I had, however it is heavier than \"regular\" stick vacuums that are common nowadays. It is very maneuverable, and easy to get in hard to reach places. The attachments are also great. I will note, they don't stay on the attachment holder on the vacuum very well, but I usually just put them away in my cleaning closet until I need them anyways.Very happy with this purchase.
