                "reviewText": "Our old vacuum, which was a nearly 7-year-old Dyson, finally gave up the ghost -- right as we were moving from an apartment to a house! Thankfully, we were able to find this vacuum on Amazon that could get delivered in a day and we were able to vacuum the old apartment (and avoid a cleaning fee).This vacuum works well. The battery percent indicator is very helpful, and the different levels of suction are clearly indicated as you switch through the options. It is lightweight, and the suction works well. If you are going from a heavy-duty bagged vacuum to this cordless, bagless vacuum, it will feel different -- when we got our Dyson cordless, I had to get used to a bagless and smaller system. However, I will say that for a cordless, bagless vacuum, this vacuum does very well, and it is reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first foray into the world of cordless vacuums. I didn't want to pay a lot extra for a vacuum so I was planning to buy a corded vacuum. This Tasvac S8 was on a great special that put it in line with corded vacuums. I decided to give this a try. I must say it is very nice to not have to negotiate a cord for once. This vacuum is very versatile and it is so much easier vacuuming furniture with this vacuum than with my Shark Navigator that would tip over constantly. The Tasvac is very nimble and easy to maneuver. It is very convenient to use on my carpeted stairs but this vacuum does not do a good job on the traditional pile carpet on my stairs. I have to make many passes over the same spot. My experience mirrors other reviews that I have read about regular to higher pile carpet. This vacuum does do a great job on floors, low pile area rugs and furniture. The run time is about 15-20 minutes for me. I was hoping that the brush roller could be turned off on floors, but I do not see a setting to do so. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.",

All in all there\u2019s nothing I didn\u2019t like about this vacuum bu. I usually never review products, but this one is a winner and I had to let everyone know who are contemplating purchasing . It\u2019s worth it, buy it.",

The suction power itself looks fine, but probably some design flaw with head that does not pick up articles and hair.Also the stick is possibly with electronic leakage. It\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s real electronic leakage or static electricity. I touch it twice and got shocked twice so did not dare to try the third time.Returning it.",

                "reviewText": "I was hoping this would prove to be my go-to vacuum, however that is not the case.Good points - it is very lightweight and easy to use. Am glad it does not have a trigger that you have to continuously press (my arthritic hands can't squeeze for long periods - I'm looking at you, Dyson). It is very easy to maneuver over carpet and bare wood.Not so good points - The cord is too short. Would like to be able to vacuum several rooms without having to unplug and move the cord. I am barely able to vacuum my living room without running out of cord, and my house is a small rancher. If this was the only negative feature I'd give it a higher score, but not the case.The canister is too small, so I am constantly having to empty it, and as I have cats the cat hair is everywhere (not to mention my long hair - ugh LOL).It does not seem to have a very strong suction, so I am not confident it is picking up everything. I got a corded vac because I feel the cordless has less suction power, but will need to reconsider. I'll keep this as my backup/basement vacuum.Given the price it's an okay vacuum, however I am searching for something better.",
