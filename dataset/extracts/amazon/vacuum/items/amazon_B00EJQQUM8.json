Even if I had bought 4 of these and rotated them I would still of had, much better than the way more expensive models. NEVER going back to fancy pancy \"expensive\" crap vacs. For the elderly and limited mobility like me no better vac made. Price has gone up $10 but I do not care. Thank you and your welcome!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a replacement for my Eureka 169B whose brush roll motor died after 4.4 years. The Dirt Devil Vibe SD20020 is super cheap right now $19.98 probably because DD seems to have come up with a new model that it\u2019s releasing this month.Both the DD Vibe and the Eureka are fairly light (both are 4.4 lbs) and they both have a motorized brush roll. Both of them have a rating of 2 amperes. The suction power of the Eureka is strong but the DD Vibe\u2019s is even stronger. The DD Vibe can pick up uncooked thin pasta (linguine) and whole peppercorn off a smooth surface. The Eureka can\u2019t.You can remove the handle off the Eureka to convert it to a \u201chandheld\u201d but it\u2019s not really a handheld vac because the floor nozzle is still attached. The DD Vibe, on the other hand, can be fully separated from its floor nozzle, converting it into a real handheld vac. It even comes with a crevice tool which is not as narrow (therefore, doesn't suck in as strongly) as the quick flip crevice tool of the Dirt Devil Scorpion SD20005RED but good enough for general hand vacuuming.The crevice tool can also attach to the handle so I don\u2019t have to go looking for it when I need it. This is very convenient when I\u2019m vacuuming the kitchen floor and I need to switch to a handheld to get at little pieces of debris in tight corners. I used to have to go and get a separate hand vac for this. Now, I only have to put my foot on the floor nozzle (to hold it down) while I press the nozzle release with my left thumb then pull the hand vac part off the floor nozzle with my right hand. So quick! However, I don\u2019t think reaching down for the nozzle release button is going to be easy for people who have problems bending low. I tried lifting up the DD Vibe (so I don't have to bend that low) and pressing the release button with my thumb while the rest of my fingers hold the front of the floor nozzle, then I pulled the floor nozzle off. I was able to remove the floor nozzle without having to bend. However, some people with weaker/stiffer hands would probably find it difficult to press the button while also holding the floor nozzle. It would be easier if you can rest the floor nozzle on some higher surface (mind where you do this because the floor nozzle is dirty!) so you can press the release button without having to bend low.The cord is 15 feet long. Some people find it too short but 15 feet seems to be the standard length for stick vacs. I usually do one section of the house at a time and just replug the stick vac into another outlet when I move from room to room.The dirt cup is clear so you can easily see when it needs to be emptied. There\u2019s a clear window over the brush roll so you can check if the brush roll is working or not.I do a lot of sewing. Threads on the floor get wound up around the brush roll as they do on any other vacuum cleaner brush roll. I turn on the stick vac (brush roll off) then take pointy-tipped scissors and snip along the length of the brush roll to cut the threads and pull them off the brush roll. The cut threads get sucked into the vacuum cleaner.The DD Vibe uses filter F77. I usually buy a spare filter so I can swap a filter in when the other one has been washed and is waiting to dry. On the Dirt Devil website, the F77 is $2.10. The price on Amazon starts at $11.29 (why?). On cleaning the filter, the owner\u2019s manual says: \u201cHold filter under running water to rinse. DO NOT use soap/detergent. Tap excess water out of filter. Allow filter to COMPLETELY DRY for at least 24 hours before replacing in dirt cup.\u201dJust \u201chold the filter under running water\u201d? That must be a very clean filter. In my experience, dirt/hair/debris on vacuum cleaner filters don\u2019t just fall off by themselves. They cling really tenaciously. I usually have to tap the filter on some hard surface and also use an old toothbrush to remove the dirt. The manual doesn\u2019t say why detergent shouldn\u2019t be used. Does it have some special coating that\u2019s going to be removed by detergent? Don\u2019t you just hate it when someone says \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d but doesn\u2019t tell you why (and the reason is not as obvious as say \u201cdon\u2019t touch the soldering iron bit when it\u2019s plugged in or hot)?The DD Vibe, with a 2A rating, is already a lot better than most other stick vacs which have much lower ampere rating. I wish though that manufacturers would make stick vacs with higher power rating. My Dirt Devil Scorpion handvac is 7A. Why can\u2019t they use that same motor on a stick vac with a motorized brush roll?There are 4 small rollers on the bottom of the floor nozzle. They roll easily on smooth surfaces (wood floors, stone tiles). However, the floor nozzle doesn\u2019t glide well on rugs. I have super low-pile entryway, kitchen and bathroom rugs. Pushing the stick vac forward doesn\u2019t help. It \u201csticks\u201d. What works for me is lifting the stick vac, then setting it on the rug and then pulling it back. I repeat that all over the rug until I consider the rug sufficiently cleaned. Using the brush roll also fluffs up the bath rug (You know when bath rugs look so flat after so many feet have stood on it) and makes it look fresh again.Except for the handle tube (metal), everything is plastic (the brittle kind). I felt a bit of apprehension when I looked at the plastic handle and the two screw holes I have to use to screw it to the metal handle tube. There\u2019s just very thin brittle plastic between the metal screws and the metal handle tube. Be careful when you assemble the handle. Don\u2019t overtighten or you can crack the plastic screw holes.The end of the plastic handle doesn\u2019t have a hole. It may not be important to some but it is very important to me. The Eureka is similar to the DD Vibe in that it also has a plastic handle and a metal handle tube. However, the plastic handle of the Eureka is thicker and has a hole. I use that hole to hang the stick vac instead of just standing it at some spot and having it fall to the floor when it gets bumped by someone or something. To compensate for the absence of a handle hole, I stationed the DD Vibe near a narrow post on which I hang a looped Velcro cable tie. I slip that loop over the post and DD Vibe so that the DD Vibe doesn\u2019t just fall or slide down the floor.My DD Vibe was shipped by Amazon Logistics. They didn't use any shipping box at all. They just slapped the shipping label on the product box (that doesn't have any protective packing inside at all) and shipped as is. Amazon cutting corners - hate it.",

Second, it needs to be able to roll or glide over the surface it is cleaning.This vacuum really only does one of those things. Sure, it CAN clean a surface with suction, but this is horrible obfuscated by its inability to roll cleanly over said surface, instead catching on every little bump (such as the threads of a carpet) and kicking upwards, thus failing utterly to efficiently do its job.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATEAfter almost 2 years of very lightweight use, we are disappointed, it worked fine when it was new, but we did not like that you have to carefully clean it after each use because the filter inside the canister is easy to clog.Worse is the fact that you have to use a scissors to cut the hair off the roller each time otherwose the roller will not spin at all and you lose 75% of it cleaning power.More expensive units have powered brushes which makes a gigantic difference, these low cost units are really only good for very light cleanups, light dust or very light dry dirt.Once there is too much hair that wraps around the roller (very easy to do if you have anyone in the household has any hair at all on their body then its useless and picks up almost nothing because the roller is not turning.The roller also slows down due to age so after two years of light duty (we only use it once our twice a month because we have a large very powerful unit as well) so it has a short lifespan.It does have a thick rubber strip that rubs against the carpet and acts like a carpet rake, this does help move the dust/dirt but does not help life the dirt into the container.We are surprised that after 2 years of extremely light duty the roller now doesn't spin despite toe much we carefully clean it.Yes, you have to clean it by hand every time you use it, which is definitely not desirable because it is intended for quick pickups so having to them clean it means that its not quick at all.Its great that it is AC powered and NOT battery powered because the fan spins at full power all the time, the power cord is long enough that I can reach two rooms from one outlet which is convenient and it appears to be more powerful than the battery powered model we previous had from tis company.Not recommended.Original reviewWe were shocked at how tiny the box was when it arrived. Its certainly is slimmer and literally only half the weight of our previous top-of-the line battery operated Dirt Devil, yet this slim unit feels more powerful and because we plug it into the wall, it retains full cleaning power all the time and never needs to be recharged.Its an excellent cleaner, we ran over the same carpet that we just cleaned and this unit pulled up so much dirt and hair that it makes the battery operated units look useless.It's lightweight so its a joy to grab for quick pickup jobs so we don't have to drag out our huge super powerful full-size vacuum so its small size is a big plus.You can also unsnap the handle and floor sweeper to use it as a handheld unit to clean the sofa, windowsills, car seats, etc.The box it comes in is tiny so obviously you have to assemble it, but its easy. The flow sweeper snaps into the main vacuum, the shaft snaps into the top of the main vacuum, and the grip slides on the shaft, where they supply you with two black Phillips head screws, just insert the screws into the only two holes, tighten with (your own) Phillips head screwdriver, and its all set and ready to use.The 15 foot long power cord is plenty long enough, and because it is AC powered (no battery) it retains full power at all times and it never loses power no matter how long you use it, which is a great relief.Overall we are pleasantly surprised at how small and how powerful this unit really is, it is a great improvement over the previous battery operated Dirt Devils because its so light weight that it actually is much easier to use.",

                "reviewText": "\"La aspiradora de juguete\" Eso dijo mi madre cuando le regal\u00e9 esta aspiradora, jeje obviamente al ver como funcionaba (yo tengo una) rapidamente cambi\u00f3 de opini\u00f3n. La aspiradora es bastante ligera y manejable, si parece una aspiradora tipo Barbie \u00a1pero vaya que funciona!El manejo que le doy principalmente es en pisos duros, no la recomiendo para uso en alfombras porque su funci\u00f3n es mas que nada de juntar basurita, morusas de pan y pelos de mascota (raz\u00f3n por la que yo la compr\u00e9) de los pisos duros. Claro que la puedes utilizar en alfombras pero la potencia no es la misma que con una aspiradora tama\u00f1o adulto (jeje) y aparte de que tendr\u00edas que estar limpiando el mini filtro a cada rato.Es buena para limpieza r\u00e1pida, deshacerte de los pelos de tus mascotas y para darle una pasada a tus muebles, tambi\u00e9n la puedes convertir en una aspiradora de mano para aspirar tu coche o lugares donde no puedas usar la aspiradora mientras est\u00e1 en modo de rueditas y cepillo. Tambi\u00e9n puedes utilizarla como aspiradora de telara\u00f1as si le dejas el tubito de extensi\u00f3n y le quitas la parte que tiene las rueditas y cepillo. En fin, excelente mini aspiradora!**ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N** 3 de Junio-2016La aspiradora sigue funcionando al 100 despu\u00e9s de un poco menos de un a\u00f1o, lo unico malo es que la canastita/filtro que se tiene que limpiar se est\u00e1 rompiendo de un lado (lo que es la tela), la rotura es peque\u00f1a pero estoy seguro que esto se debe al hecho que cuando la voy a sacudir para quitarle el polvo la golpeo contra otra superficie y pues esos impactos son los que poco a poco han ido causando el da\u00f1o, en realidad la culpa la tengo yo por flojo y por no enjuagar la canastita con agua como debo hacer. Obvio ya la limpio como es debido pero a todos aquellos que hacen lo mismo (golpear la canastita) les aconsejo que ya no lo hagan, ya que al romperse la tela del filtro comenzar\u00e1 a pasar todo el polvo al motor de la aspiradora y pues se puede descomponer, estoy seguro que no ser\u00eda dif\u00edcil reparar el da\u00f1o, pero ya aprend\u00ed mi lecci\u00f3n :). Fuera de eso la aspiradora sigue funcionando bien, aunque ya subi\u00f3 de precio de 475 pesos de cuando la compr\u00e9 hace un a\u00f1o sigue siendo un buen producto. Saludos!",
