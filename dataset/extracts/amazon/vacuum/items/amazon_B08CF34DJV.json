                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for hard floors--yay, no more sweeping!",
                "reviewText": "Moving in to a new house with beautiful smooth tile floor was a vast difference from the fully carpeted house we came from. I came to quickly learn that A. If I wanted a clean house, I was going to need to sweep EVERY SINGLE DAY (you know that feeling when you walk around barefoot on hard floors and end up with dirt covering the bottoms of your feet? yeah, it's pretty awful), and B. Our trusty carpet vacuum was not going to do the trick. *sigh* So my options were to: sweep every single day for the rest of my life, deal with the dirt getting on my feet (yeah...no), or purchase a floor vacuum. ding ding ding. Floor vacuum it was!Through the black hole of Amazon searches, I came across this one and took a chance when there were NO reviews (I know, such a thrill seeker here!) but it had all the features I wanted most: lightweight, good suction power, convertible (to be able to use for more than just vacuuming my floor), affordable, and corded (the really good cordless ones would end up costing me my first born, so yup, this was on the list). Now that I've used it for a week, I'm here to give you the deets so you don't have to take quite as much of a chance.Let's start with the cons:--It takes a hot minute to arrive. I've gotten used to prime one-day shipping, so waiting a week was like waiting an eternity--It doesn't have a place to put the cord. This is not a deal breaker for me, but sure would be nice to be able to put the cord away neatly somehow. Bonus if it had a retractable cord thing. But alas, it does not! I end up rolling it back and tying it with the Velcro strip it comes with.--I don't quite understand the purpose of some of the buttons...but that may just be personal user error (instruction manual, what that? ;) )Pros:--It's got three different attachments--the floor attachment (which is extendable!), one with a brush (perfect for vacuuming furniture), and a thin pointed one to use for all the nooks and crannies--It's lightweight. You're not going to be building any significant muscles using this one, that's for sure. You might even be able to give it to your child to use--teach 'em young and all that--The floor attachment head SWIVELS! This means you can pretty much get anywhere with it--corners and under all the furniture, it's pretty great. I was able to vacuum fully under our king-sized bed with no significant effort.--It does what it's supposed to--clean the floor. Picks up dirt, litter, and oh boy, does it get all the cat hair tumbleweeds plaguing our house thanks to our two cats (one of which has a preposterous amount of fur)What this vacuum is not going to do is get hair out of carpets--it's not meant for that. It has no roller at the bottom, so if that is something you are looking for, look elsewhere. But if you have hard floors, are looking for an affordable lightweight vacuum that isn't going to take up a lot of room, yet want something that will work for it's intended purpose, I recommend this one. If my experience changes as I continue using it, I will be sure to add it on to my review here.08/15/2020",

                "reviewText": "This is a great light weight vacuum to pick up dust, cat and dog fur, small things. I love it because it goes right under my sofa, tv stand and all of my furniture where the big vacuum can't reach. The suction, believe it or not, is pretty good for these places. The biggest problem for me is the dust filter. When you go to clean it, it is very hard to get all the dust out. It would have been nice if they had made it removable. I have to plug in and get my other small hand vacuum to clean it. It's a drag and takes more time. It would have been so simple to just have had a removable filter! I would have even paid more money to have that feature.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my mother so she could get rid of the one she has that never picked anything up even though she thought different. I didn\u2019t want to spend too much money,wanted something light and not a hassle and with this that converts to a hand vacuum is a major plus. I put it together for her,very easy so I didn\u2019t need the instructions. As I was putting it together I was saying to myself \u201cthis thing won\u2019t be doing much\u201d\u2026I WAS WRONG!! This has some really good suction power! She is very happy and she said now she can throw the old DD she has away (which means it\u2019ll go in her garage lol). So I\u2019m happy with this purchase. It maneuvers really well. I got to see for myself how well it really works. & She has area rugs,marble,tile and no carpet. She has a cat that sheds and I read some reviews than mentioned this isn\u2019t good for pet hair,it works fine on her area rug with her one cat. Maybe not good for multiple pets with carpet. The only downside to me is it doesn\u2019t stand on it\u2019s own and it\u2019s not cordless,but overallI\u2019m happy!!!!!",

I\u2019m not sure why this item got such good reviews bc it\u2019s very flimsy and a lot lighter than I expected. Will probably have to return because I need something good on pet hair and dust for my apartment and it\u2019s already falling apart before I even put it together.",

                "reviewText": "Bought vacuum to clean up dirt that falls from my plants and feathers from my parakeet. Great suction, nozzles are skinny enough to get under my shelves. Unit gets a pretty warm after vacuuming for about eight minutes. overall good for getting into small crannies and picks up bigger crumbs. It is a heavier than I expected, but not bad. Actually seems well-made. electric cord and unit materials are nice. I empty out dust and tap out filter more often so it doesn\u2019t get clogged so fast.",
