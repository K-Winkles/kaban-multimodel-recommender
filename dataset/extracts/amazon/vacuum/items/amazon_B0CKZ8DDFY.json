This has saved me a significant amount of time and effort, particularly when cleaning large rooms or moving between different areas of the house. The suction power of this vacuum cleaner is impressive, as it effectively picks up dust, dirt and pet hairs from both hard floors and carpets. The various attachments and accessories that come with the vacuum are quite useful. One of the major selling point for me was the battery life. The long-lasting battery allows me to clean multiple rooms in a single charge, which has been incredibly convenient. Additionally, the charging dock makes it simple to store and keep the vacuum ready for use at all times. Another plus point is easy of maintenance. The dust bin is simple to empty, and the filter is easy to remove and clean. In terms of noise level, i have been pleasantly surprised by how quiet this vacuum cleaner is during operation. It allows me to clean without disturbing others in the house. Overall, i have beed extremely satisfied with the performance and convenience of this cordless vacuum cleaner. I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a reliable and efficient cordless vacuum cleaner.",

Hangs on the wall out of the way because of its compact size. Comes with a tool that hooks hair off of the removable brush head. Easy to clean out. Goes from carpet to hardwood to linoleum with no loss of suction. It is quiet. It slides easily under furniture. A breeze to use and I love it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have laminate flooring throughout my home and this works perfect for that. I can vacuum the whole house only using about 30% of the battery on the regular setting. Cons: The suction is not the best on my rugs, unless used on the highest setting, but it does drain the battery quite quickly. The brush attachment needs improvement. (See video) I have to hold it in place to clean inside any kind of creases, and it does require the highest power setting. The storage holder only seems to work if the vacuum is locked and touching the floor. Pros: Cleaning the roller and filter is easy, it\u2019s much quieter than I expected, decent price, battery life is good on hard surfaces, lightweight.",

Suction power is really good and it is controllable, you can increase it from the touch screen on the main unit. The screen on the unit is very handy and as mentioned it is touch, you can see the battery percentage and modify suction power. the carpet tool has a brush that rotates and speed up with vacuum power as well, it came with an extra HEPA filter. I really love it since I don't have to carry our big vacuum with me upstairs and it works as good as our big vacuum. It is perfect for pet hairs and cleaning the stairs. Strongly recommend it to a friend",

The downside of it is when I first unpackaged the item of course I charge the battery like they said for 4 hours well I have it practically charged all night long and it only lasts on high speed maybe 30 minutes or 40 vacuuming so I'm really upset of the battery situation I feel like they should have another backup or customize their battery to last longer at least 2 hours if it's fully charged for all-nighter then it shouldn't be draining in 30 minutes or 40 on high speed!!! Unfortunately I had thrown away the the Box is not I would have just have returned it because again I'm very very upset you pay so much money and you would think that these charge battery would last for two to three hours. I think the Dollar Tree batteries will last longer than the actual charged one!!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased after using my sister's Dyson cordless that she loves. Bad thing about the Dyson, there is no hold on button and her hands get tired holding the trigger. The Haimeec at $500 less cleans well maybe not as good as Dyson but very close! It's easy to handle the display shows battery power on the display and so far haven't run until it kills battery. I found it to be a great vaccum for bath mats and door entrances where winter grass clippings seem to stick to everyone's shoes and deposit them on our hardwood floors. This Vac makes it a easy clean up and it's size allows it to go where our other vaccum won't. It very manuversble and the head makes 90 degree turns to help where others miss. We love it!Very easy to dump canister and can be easily cleaned with water. HEPA filter also can be rinsed with water.",
