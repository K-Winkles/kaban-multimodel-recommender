                "reviewText": "I expected this vacuum to sound like a chopper landing on my roof. To my surprise, it's very quiet on the lower setting, and reasonably quiet on the faster setting.When using it with the power head, there are two brushes to choose from - one that's softer, for delicate flooring, and ones that's intended for tiled surfaces and carpet. It doesn't take long to switch between the two brushes, and it also comes with a tool to help remove long hair that gets wrapped around it. The power head also has LED lights on it, which are useful; and swivels to help maneuver around corners. It can also be extended to a comfortable length.There are also two additional heads to attach if you don't need the power head. One is a crevice tool, and the other is wide brush. The suction is impressive. I'm not sure that it needs two speeds, it's not like I've ever wanted just a little bit of suction. I'm sure it saves on battery and extends runtime, but I've never had a need to run it on the lower speed.The vacuum assembles quickly, and is easy to dump the collection reservoir. It's a little more involved cleaning the filter, but not bad. It also comes with and extra paper filter once the ones that comes inside the unit is no longer able to be effectively cleaned.I never clocked the 45 minute runtime, but I know I didn't get that out of it. That must be best-case scenario, without the power head and on low speed. Even still, the battery life didn't disappoint me.For me, it's a great second vacuum to have around. That could be the rub for others weighing the purchase of this. It's on the expensive side just to have as a second vacuum. However, if you live in a small apartment, it's the only one you should need. Living in a medium to large home, this would be a second vacuum that is very versatile and handy, just not enough to have it as your only vacuum. I'm glad I have it, although I can't speak to longevity and durability at this point. The other minor grievance is that you can't lock the power head from swiveling, which was a bit of an inconvenience vacuuming the carpeted stairs.Overall I was impressed with the power, and I was really impressed with it's versatility and quiet operation. I only have to drag out my main vacuum maybe once a week instead of every day, and this easily fills in between like a charm.",

                "reviewText": "This vacuum is lightweight and has good suction. It comes with an extra filter, cleaning brush for the filter, another brush roller that is soft, and a few attachments. It was easy to assemble and even had a near capacity charge so I could try it right out of the box. I have a 600 square foot room on the 3rd floor of my house that I use as an office & sewing space, and needed a vacuum that was small and convenient to use. This stick vacuum does the job nicely. It wouldn't do well for heavier work such as carpets, large rugs and bigger spaces, so don't buy this if you need a stick vacuum that is more heavy duty.I like that the filters are reusable and can be washed, so I'm sure those will last a long time. I wish the vacuum would stand upright on its own, but it doesn't. Good vacuum for the price, and works well for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a vacuum downstairs and been looking for something that isn\u2019t bulky and can be stored in a closet full of stuff. I found the one that looked like an expensive Dyson, but was a bit skeptical if it\u2019s powerful enough to do the job since it isn\u2019t a Dyson. This thing works!First, it was easy to assemble. Second, it was already pre-charged so I was able to test it out for a good half-hour before it started to die down. But, I must say, I was impressed by the suction and how light it is. It comes with all the attachments you need for different tasks. It also comes with an extra HEPA filter. The filters are reusable and can be brushed off with a brush that comes with the unit. The filter assembly can be washed and no replacement needed.This is legit. And for a fraction of the Dyson price, this is a great find!",
