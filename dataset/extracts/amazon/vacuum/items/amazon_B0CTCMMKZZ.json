                "reviewText": "This vacuum is light weight and so easy to carry around and use. It has excellent suction. There are three suction settings and I always use the strongest but when I do, the battery dies in 15-20 minutes. That\u2019s enough to do a daily sweeping. When I do deep cleaning, I have to plan around getting it recharged which hasn\u2019t been a problem. I vacuum a couple rooms, plug it in while I\u2019m cleaning the next two rooms, then it\u2019s ready to sweep again. There are lots of attachments included. It\u2019s great for stairs and easy to sweep under furniture. I should mention that the battery lasts longer if it\u2019s not on the strongest suction level. It\u2019s nice not having a cord to trip over. I also like that this is light enough to carry downstairs to use.",

                "reviewText": "This Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, is a Stick Vacuum that's perfect for home carpet and hardwood floors. I got it in this sleek and stylish color that just looks super cool in my home. But it's not just about the looks; it's got some serious power too!So, it comes with a powerful 93000RPM high-speed digital motor. I don't really know what that means, but all I know is that it creates this high-speed airflow that sucks up all the dirt and dust like a champ. The suction power is a massive 22KPa at the \"Max\" mode, which basically means it can deep clean like a pro. No more worrying about those stubborn spots that just won't go away!And let's talk about battery life, because, trust me, it has a total 14000mAh large-capacity battery, and it can run for up to 40 minutes on the \"Min\" mode. So I can literally clean the entire house without any interruptions. No more annoying breaks to charge the vacuum!Now, here's the best part \u2013 if you're a pet owner like me, you're going to adore this vacuum. It's super pet-friendly, and I can vouch for that. The brush roller is wider and larger, so it can pick up all the pet hair, dust, and other messes with ease. And, here's the real magic \u2013 the floor brush has this comb design that stops hair from getting all wrapped around the roller. It's like a miracle for pet owners. No more battling with tangled hair in the vacuum!It's can clean multi-surface too. It can handle low-pile rugs, hardwood, marble, tiles, and other hard floors like a boss. Plus, it's ultra-lightweight, so I can easily reach high areas like curtains and ceilings. And if I need to clean the sofa or my car, I can just convert it into a handheld vacuum. It's like having multiple vacuums in one!What's also super cool is how easy it is to maneuver. The motorized brush can swivel 175\u00b0 sideways and 90\u00b0 up and down. I feel like a cleaning ninja with this thing! Plus, it has LED headlights on the brush head, so I can spot hidden debris and pet hair even in dark areas and under furniture. No more missing those dust bunnies!",

                "reviewText": "This took some time to come in but once it arrived it was well packaged. All my kids have used this as well as I and each are overjoyed, they choose this time and time again over our other regular corded vacuum. First off it is cordless which I appreciate much easier to move from room to room and works great on the stairwell as it is skinnier than other vacuums. It has 3 different suction settings each work well and pick up the smallest dust. My son uses this in lieu of sweeping now as he says that it picks up better and he gets the job done quicker. I do agree with him as he was a terrible at sweeping he always missed smaller specks with this he does miss any specks now. Price is reasonable and I really like the color of it. All together i think this is a wonderful purchase and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The stick vac suctions well using the high speed but has a shorter battery life at that speed.Would have preferred if it came with 2 batteries. One to use and one as the backup, when needed you could just swap out the battery and continue.Thankfully this is not my only vacuum as wouldn't want to wait for the battery to recharge to complete my vacuuming.3 motor speeds (high, medium and low): 1- Low it will last around 35 minutes light cleaning 2- Medium roughly 25 minutes ok suction 3- High 15 to 10 minutes strong suctionIt's not a bad vacuum, but could use some improvements: \u2022 Move the trigger for emptying the canister. The trigger is too close the vacuum trigger. \u25cb On several occasions I have accidently pulled the wrong trigger, dumping everything I vacuumed back on the floor. \u2022 Akso to empty the bin you need to remove the extension pole. \u2022 Wish there was a holder for the clevis and brush tools on the extension pole that way they can always be accessible when needed.",

The large read out display right on the top of it for easy viewing, easy to empty, easy to charge, easy to use, easy to adjust, easy to maneuver, and easy to follow instructions. I love this so much more than the much more expensive popular name brand one I currently have. The suction on this one is so much better! Would absolutely recommend and it it comes boxed very nicely for gifting as well.",
