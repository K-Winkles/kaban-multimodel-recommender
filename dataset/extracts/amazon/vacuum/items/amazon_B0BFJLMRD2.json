Also this is first Sanitaire I bought that has a filtration bag inside regular vacuum bag. It gets screwed into the base & is not compatible with the hook & latch on dump bags that we use. Doesn't sound super powerful but will put in small account.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years, I've been through multiple different cheaper and lower quality vacuum cleaners from the big box store. Bissell, Eureka, Dyson, Shark. With three cats and a decent amount of foot traffic through my mostly carpeted home, these above listed machines constantly clogged and had would stink if you didn't wash the washable/reusable HEPA filter, plus the dirt cups were gross to empty. I wanted to switch back to the classic bagged vacuum I remembered my grandma having. This machine outperforms all of the above listed brands I've tried over the years. Although, previously owned by Eureka/Electrolux and now owned by Bissell, Sanitaire is still in its own class, as far as quality goes. This machine is super quiet to use, and I like that the sound isn't an awful high pitch screaming noise. It has a very soft sound. It has very powerful suction power, and the allergen filtration is awesome. No odor while vacuuming, because the bags filter so well. Very lightweight, and it agitates and grooms the carpet great. Leaves nice lines. Carpet height adjustment dial is very user friendly and easy to turn. Bag changes are super simple. I also like that if, in the RARE event it jams/clogs or you need to replace the belt, no tools are necessary to take it apart. Everything snaps apart and snaps back together without tools. All around awesome vacuum. 10 out of 5 stars!!!",
