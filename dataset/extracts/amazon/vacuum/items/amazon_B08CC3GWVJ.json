Until I bought a Shark Navigator, almost everything that blows or sucks in the house is a Dyson. I like my Shark better than theirs and it cost half as much. Theirs has no light shining on the floor ahead of you and believe me, you can't get stuff you can't see swept up! Also, with this you see clear tracks on the floor where the dust is now missing. Not just the dirt! It is amazing and I didn't want the light! The Dysons are quieter but they don't have a carpet cleaning setting. Turning on the carpet roller makes it noisier.I really like having the trigger to pull that makes the suction stronger. I use it about half the time...except today after having neglected cleaning for a couple of weeks.My dog sheds like crazy and it does the job pretty well. I do choose to vacuum the carpets every other week with the Navigator. It lifts the carpet nap better and gets up a bit more out of the nap. The stick does clean it well to the eye.Suction - my Shark picks up a lot of things on the floor that the Dysons can't; like leaves and dog kibble. It keeps pulling up all kinds of stuff until it just quits and then you know the battery has run out. Only twice since I bought it in November 2021.The front sponge roller popped out when I was using it today. Never before. It had picked up a corner of a rug. I cleaned out the area that holds it and put it right back in without having to look up how. Really nice!It's great! I am really happy!6 months ago -Get one of these great cleaners while they are offering discounts!This quite surpassed my expectations for cleaning. The Vertex technology of having a solid, soft roller in front is amazing at cleaning, even the DUST off of my hard surfaces! I thought I wanted to be able to turn off the front headlights, but NO! I love seeing the absolutely dust-free/furless paths I am leaving on my floors. You need to do an internet search for reviews on Vertex! That's what sold me! I am the daddy of a canine shedding machine and I am disabled with walking and balance issues. I am so glad I'll be able to vacuum as often as I want to. I am the owner of a Shark Navigator that sucks rugs off the floor. This isn't that powerful but I am really satisfied! It got my rugs clean with one pass. And my hard floors are sparkling clean!I was a bit scared about the weight of this vacuum because of my disability. You need not be. This is well balanced and although it won't stand up on its own, it will steadily lean on table/counter high surfaces like the back of a chair. Vacuuming for me used to mean fighting a cord wrapping around my cane and my back hurting for days. No more and I felt safe & steady using this vacuum.Do NOT be scared away by the reviews about static shocks! I used it through a full charge 3 times yesterday without a hint of static shock. It held a charge for at least 40 minutes while having the carpet roller operating about half the time. I am pleased with how long the charge lasts and how quickly it recharged.The cleaning head goes easily under the furniture that I kept a dust mop for. That sucker's out of my way now!My model comes with 3 tools; a crevice tool, a multi-angle duster, and a 'pet' upholstery tool that is converts from a 4\" brush to a flat fuzzy tool. The motor assembly is easy to detach to use these tools.I am pleased to have the HEPA filtration but it wasn't a feature I felt I needed.I used it on carpet setting a bunch but VERY seldom used the boost suction mode, which does need to be constantly held on with your finger. But you won't be needing it except for bad spot cleaning! This picked up multiple leaves that were on my floors from heavy holiday traffic. I was pleasantly surprised. My upright only gets about half of them.I have multiple Dyson products in my house and a Dyson vacuum in the basement that after 4 years broke and won't switch from hose to floor. When I got my Shark upright Navigator I was blown away with the increased suction that seemed twice the Dyson. So, when I shopped for a cordless stick vacuum I didn't heed my daughters' encouragement that I follow them back into Dyson world with this and went straight to Shark!I am really glad to have the 5 year warranty on the vacuum and 2 year on the REPLACABLE battery! Don't spend hundreds of dollars on a vacuum that doesn't have a removable/replaceable battery! I'll admit that after my Dyson experience I did buy the $35 extended warranty for peace of mind.I found two 'con' issues but they were definitely not deal breakers! If you do some heavy cleaning you will have to reach into the dust cup and remove the wad of debris that wraps around the metal mesh post. I noticed some hair wrapped around the back beater-bar and when I turned over the cleaning head to easily open the cover to the bar, I found a bunch of dog hair on the brush bars that catch any errant fur. It was easy to pull off with my fingers. I would never bother to do that regularly. I just noticed it when I was getting my daughter-in-law's really long hair unwrapped from the bar. That will only be a holiday experience.I'll update this in a few weeks, but I wanted to encourage you to take advantage of the discounts being offered. I am so very happy I got this vacuum now!",

                "reviewText": "My old Shark Rotator finally died after about 8 years. There are a few things that the video reviews of the Vertex didn't seem to cover. For such a big price tag, I thought I'd come in here and give an honest review from a mom of 3, with a 2400 square foot house with stairs, and 3 pets who shed like crazy.First of all, the battery life seems sufficient for my needs. I listened to the advice of other reviewers not to leave it plugged in all the time and forgot to charge it after I'd vacuumed the whole house - with a lot of \"turbo\" usage. I later picked it up and vacuumed the stairs (more on that in a bit). Then I made my two teens vacuum their rooms a few days later. Finally, this morning, I vacuumed the kitchen and the laundry room and it just shut off when it ran out of battery. So it'll get the job done in one charge, with some juice leftover for more. However, there's no way to see how much battery is left unless you plug it in, then the lights on the battery come on to indicate charge. We did get a spare battery to change out with this one, which seemed pretty cool.The suction is sufficient. The quietness of this vacuum is misleading. While vacuuming the kitchen on normal mode it sucked up a \"piece of toast stress toy\" that I fully thought the Vertex would just bump out of the way like my old Rotator. The Vertex ate that thing and then promptly threw a red light. The toy was easy to remove - I just turned off the vacuum and spun the roller until the vacuum spat the toy back out.On the subject of the rollers - they do not like berber carpet. Like, at all. I think the rollers are trying to leave lines in the carpet - a sign of cleanliness, right? But on the berber carpet the vacuum catches and stops completely, sometimes bouncing and sometimes getting stuck. This was a problem in every carpeted room in my house. Be aware that you may have to find the \"direction\" your berber is flattened (lol) and vacuum askew of that. This honestly confuses me because the vacuum seems cleverly designed to just bump up onto new surfaces like rugs, thresholds, and raised carpet. So far in my house it's good for eating toys and cords, not so good for berber. Mysterious.On the dust trap: It's easy to empty, plenty of space. Sometimes, between three long-haired pets, I have to empty it twice in one vacuuming. Not a big deal, I used to do that anyway with my old Shark. The chamber doesn't get tangled clumps of fur like my old shark, either. I haven't had to fiddle with the filter yet, but for the sake of this review I went and poked around at it. There's a little arrow button on the side of the tank that releases it from the wand. Within is a foam filter and a cotton one. Easy to remove and washable - which makes me happy. I probably have to wash these every four months or so. I set them outside in the California sun to dry - under a colander so they don't blow away. Or next to the fire in the winter. I've also been known to set them on foil and put them in the oven on \"warm\" with the door open.On stairs: Where has this been my whole life? I have an old Black and Decker dust-buster that never had enough suction to justify its existence. With the Vertex, I pop the unit out of the vacuum head, throw on one of the nozzles, and go. It's really light and easy to maneuver. Corners don't stand a chance. Vacuuming the stairs is no longer a project involving a heavy unit falling down the stairs, or figuring out where and when to plug the darn thing in. Just click, go.Actually, nothing's a project anymore. In the past I'd let cat litter spread more than I liked in the laundry room because locating the broom or hauling out the old Shark Rotator and plugging it in was kind of a laborious hassle. Now? I just stand the Vertex up and go. Litter is all gone in less than a minute. When done, I fold up the vacuum in one easy move and get on with my day. I know I'm arguing over mere minutes here, but sometimes our perception of a chore is more tiresome than the chore itself, and that's often what gets in the way of my dragging out the old Shark Rotator (which served us very well during its life, don't get me wrong).Another thing I love about the Vertex is the light on the head - absolutely necessary to see all the dust and hair on the kitchen floor. One of the rollers is a neat foam thing that's easy to pop out. The other roller is a mix of the more traditional brush and a soft nylon \"blade\". I have reservations about the nylon blade part, it looks as if it's designed to eventually shred when \"it's time to change the roller.\" I don't like companies telling me when it's time for me to replace parts, and I have a suspicion that Shark wants us to replace this roller every 6 months for a hefty fee. Knowing corporate greed, I also have a suspicion this part will no longer be available within the year when a newer vacuum model comes out, necessitating the need for a new vacuum. If this turns out to be the case, I'll come back and rage vehemently about greedy corporations. I don't want to replace my things every 3 years. I want to keep my things for decades. Landfills are a problem. Pollution and carbon are a problem. Please allow me to do my part in fighting those problems by not necessitating the manufacture of more stuff. Thank you.My overall takeaway of this product: My husband hates that it doesn't seem to work well on our berber carpet. It sucks things up fine, but it gets caught on the carpet ridges and refuses to budge. Personally, I love this thing. I just put up with the berber fight and vacuum a different direction. It's so light and easy to just grab and use. I had no idea how limiting the whole cord and plug thing was until I no longer had to worry about it. I can now reach the corner by the fireplace without having to walk across the house and change the plug (which, admittedly, I often sighed at and promised myself I'd do next time). The \"grab and go\" aspect of this vacuum has made it easier to keep things clean. I definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to leave a review for this product because Amazons website description is false. This vacuum does not come with attachments other than a crevice tool. The customer service associate was extremely gracious and I have nothing but thanks for them. I got a replacement to my original and there were still no attachments.For the vacuum itself, I think 4 stars is fair. It's small and takes some time to cover because of it's size. But it does pack a punch. The suction on this is wonderful. The rollers do get wrapped with hair though as well and it was disappointing to see that happen the first time I vacuumed since that's a selling point. I enjoy being able to turn the roller off for hard surfaces. I actually accidently vacuumed carpet with the roller off and it was still sucking up more than my old hoovers. This is my first actual nice and pricey vacuum and I'm glad I got it.It's extremely maneuverable and light. I can vacuum my stairs with the whole unit. That's not perfect but sure beats having to use a hose off a hoover. Battery lasts as expected, if you can get a spare that would be helpful.I would like to get some additional attachments to see what this baby can really do !Picture for reference since there's a few different models on the purchase page. I also purchased directly from Amazon, not another seller.",
