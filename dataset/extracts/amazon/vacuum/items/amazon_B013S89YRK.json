This vacuum has plenty of suction for your floors and carpets. I found that when vacuuming the floor mats you do not need the beater bars running. It takes a bit of getting used to when cleaning at first. This unit swivels to get into the tight spaces. As for the extra features/options I have no opinion. I would recommend purchasing this or a similar Dyson vacuum in the future when the need arises.A good value for the money paid. Make sure to get extra filters that fit this unit at the time of purchase.",

I've owned a Dyson DC40 for over 10 years & it broke & the vacuum motor itself would no longer provide suction.So it was time to get a new one. There was no smell like U get from other machines. Easy to dump the bagless cup then off to do more cleaning.I would put this machine up agienst any other vacuum on the market even the Shark. I do wish it have a light on the front so I could chase the cats with it.I recommend this vacuum 1000%. Plus you get a 5 year warranty on it. This is what was in the bagless cup after 2X's going over the 10'X10' spot oh my.",
