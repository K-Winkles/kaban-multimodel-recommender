CrossWave Pet Pro (with Tangle-Free Brush Roll and innovative Pet Multi-Surface formula) cleans better than a sponge mop and bucket and in less time.* You can seamlessly switch between cleaning hard floors to area rugs by the Fingertip Controls, while delivering the right amount of formula to your floors with the On-Demand Formula Trigger. The Tangle-Free Brush Roll scrubs to remove debris and minimizes annoying pet hair wrap. BISSELL\u00ae CrossWave\u00ae Pet Pro is safe for tile, sealed wood floors, laminate, linoleum, vinyl, rubber floor mats, pressed wood floors, area rugs, and more. Two-Tank Technology keeps the cleaning solution separate from the dirty water to ensure a fresh mix of formula and water is always being used to clean your floors. The included PET Multi-Surface with Febreze Formula helps eliminate pet odors on your floors. After cleaning, use the Pet Hair Strainer to separate pet hair and large debris from the dirty water in your dirt tank, so hair and debris can be disposed into the garbage and not down your sink. The special Rinse & Clean Out Storage Tray also helps you easily clean the machine after use, plus it stores the brush rolls for next time! CrossWave Pet Pro\u00ae is truly a groundbreaking multi-floor cleaner that is a must-have for homes with or without pets. And this machine doesn't just clean up after pets, it helps save them, too. BISSELL proudly supports BISSELL Pet Foundation\u00ae and its mission to help save homeless pets. When you buy a BISSELL pet product, you help save pets, too. We\u2019re proud to design products that help make pet messes, odors and pet homelessness disappear.",

                "reviewText": "Quick run down of the background here: I have about 1000sqft of tile/hard wood in my home. I also have a macaw, two cockatiels, and a dog who happens to enjoy shedding more than anything in the world.I don't typically review but wanted to for this since I read so many on both sides, and put off this purchase for months because I was terrified to hate it.I have used my crosswave twice, and I think in some ways there is a bit of a learning curve to getting the most out of it. All in all, I LOVE this and I don't say that lightly. We vacuum daily but, with all of the animals typically deep cleaning takes a few hours, as you vacuum, mop, move furniture, vacuum again, mop, repeat. Then you never fail to wind up with wet dog hair that she must have magically transferred onto the floor you've just cleaned 3 times :| This takes away all of that.Today, I tested for time and it took me 35 minutes to clean the entire house, including the time required to disassemble and clean the crosswave!I can't speak for anyone else but wanted to touch on some of the reviews I've read that had me questioning, and give my experience on them:-Poor Suction?At first I could see this and worried, but after some trouble shooting it occurred to me that, the suction just isn't as great when the handle is all the way leaned back, since the head lifts up from the floor a bit. This might be a bit of a design flaw I suppose, but once you figure it out? Smooth sailing.-Smelly to clean?Nah. I mean, think of it like a carpet cleaner except for hard floors. I imagine it might be bad if you leave it in there for a while but, under no circumstances would I use this and not it right after. It's simple enough.-Clogging?To be clear, I do clean up big things before I vacuum such as bird feathers, but I don't pre-clean and there is a LOT of dog hair. I suppose it could get clogged up but I haven't experienced this.-Spot cleaning?Ok, so I get this issue. I spot clean often (Birds are gross), so I don't typically have many dried up spills on the floors. Spots like right in front of the stove I have to go over a couple times, but they usually come up. If not, they've been so small that to me, it isn't a big deal to spray some cleaner and wipe them up. I don't think it spot cleans any worse than my steam mop or swiffer by any means.-Streaky?This I can also see. I have textured tile in most of the house so it isn't really a big deal to me as you can't see streaks. I feel like usually when I slow down the streaking eases up. I noticed that sometimes because it works similar to a vacuum I tend to move quickly and not consider the time needed to suck up the water. Again, think of it like a carpet cleaner but for hard floors.**I've also never used this for wet spills, and I don't know that I ever would. I'm not really in the business of making a mess of a mop for a job that could be easily done with paper towel and a squirt bottle, so I can't comment on that.All in all, I think it's worth every penny if it is for you. I don't know that it would benefit someone who didn't have a lot of hard flooring, and may be so-so on super textured floors such as stone with large divots. I don't think this would really replace a vacuum for anyone full time, but love it for once a week cleaning.Huge Pros for me:-The long cord. After reading reviews I opted for corded and am so glad I did, plus the cord is so long I rarely have to transfer it.-The head maneuvers from side to side well.-Makes the house smell wonderful!-Good over-all clean in a time saving way.-This fits under my short cabinets! I was so worried it wouldn't as my Dyson Cyclone doesn't!Cons:-You HAVE to clean it after every use, which only takes a few minutes but would be awful otherwise.-If you don't move slow, it WILL leave water streaks.-It does suction worse when the handle is too far extended.-There aren't measurements available for the head height of this anywhere online-The filter takes a few days to dry if inside. However once it was a nice enough day I put it into the sun and it dried in hours.Hope this helps someone, because I know I was up in the air for a long time!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Cleaning hardwood floors: crosswave is the only way to go to get a clean floor! It REMOVES dirt, so the floor gets cleaned. In comparison I tried/used:-mops are useless (why push around dirty water?)- swiffer \u201cwet jet\u201d type model was only ok, for floors that are semi-clean to begin with and definitely not really good for really dirt floors (I bought washable reusable microfiber pads for use with the battery-operated model that sprays proprietary cleaning solution that you then \u2018mop up\u2019 as you push it around, but, that microfiber pad gets so dirty fast, so it doesn\u2019t do a really good job)-and I bought a cordless rechargable spinning scrub brush tool but that loosened the dirt but then generated dirty water on the floor, so that tool was only good for spot cleaning a stubborn small patch of dirt and then you still have to towel up the floor to pick up the dirty waterSo I looked at TWO TANK systems, one the spits out clean water then sucks up the dirty water separately and bought this Bissell crosswave and IT WORKSIt spits clean soapy/detergent water out from the first tank, has a rotating bristled brush scrubbing that solution into the floor, then vacuums up that dirty solution continuously into a completely separate second tank.While using the crosswave on my kitchen hardwood floor (heavy traffic and very dirty), I could see obvious splots of dirt disappear as I pushed it along, but the floor didn\u2019t look spectacularly shiny clean afterwards and yet when I then went to empty the dirty water reservoir tank, HOLY SMOKES!!! Bissell clearly picked up and removed a tonne of dirt from the hardwood. I did a second pass, and even more dirt came up as evidenced by the filthy water I dumped out of the collection tank. So I am a huge fan. It\u2019s deceptive how much dirt really is on a heavily traffic floor, and it will become apparent once you use the crossweave on it and then empty the dirty water tank.It is simple to use, extremely intuitive.It is corded, but that means it\u2019s much more powerful and you can do the whole floor of a house without running out of battery. Once I\u2019m cleaning, I just want to finish the job. Cord is plenty long enough so that even large rooms can get done without having to move the plug in to a different receptacle.It has a \u2018mat\u2019 you put it on and add clean water so that the brush can spin in that bath of fresh water cleaning itself, so that even the brush is clean for the next go. Very clever and easy to use system.Pushing it around is easy, wheels are very maneuverable, the head has a profile that easily fits under kitchen counter toe kicks or a couch. Holding down the trigger to spray solution is easy, an arthritic hand could do it.You don\u2019t even have to sweep first to use this, it is a Vaccuum and will suck up any loose dirt or hair.Using it is simple and intuitive, I didn\u2019t bother reading the owners manual. I am pleased to finally have a good way to really clean the floor.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars More of a mop than a vacuum",
                "reviewText": "Overall I'm happy I got it because it works great as a mechanized mop, allowing you to get large areas done without having the wet mess and endless wringing out like manual mops. It can easily switch from hard floors to rug setting. It's lightweight (doing carpeted steps was easy). It has a nice long cord. It's easy to clean even though the process is lengthy. There are a lot of separate parts that need to be rinsed and dried after every use, but it sure beats the backbreaking alternative that manual mopping requires. I do like the automatic clean feature where it runs for 40 seconds in the tray that comes with it (but you have to rinse the parts before and after that cycle). I know it works well to remove a lot of dirt based on the gunk that collects in the dirty water bin. It leaves the surfaces only a little bit wet so they dry very fast, which is great. Cons: I was expecting it to be more of a vacuum that could also mop but it doesn't handle really hairy or chunky-strewn surfaces well. I have a lot of fur babies, birds that toss seeds and fruit everywhere, and (human) housemates with long hair that shed everywhere. You really need to vacuum your surfaces well with a regular vacuum machine before using this or the long hair gets in and strangles the roller brush, so you have to cut it off. It also leaves a few wet clumps of pet hairballs in its wake instead of sucking them up. That was disappointing, considering it was marketed as being good for pet hair, but it does pick up most of it. It didn't make a dent in any dried on, sticky stains--you'll still have to remove them another way. If you use it on a small area rug it sucks it up. You have to hold down the rug somehow or clean it another way.",

This one intrigued her because she\u2019s got medical issues with her arms and it\u2019s very light. Also, it cuts time in half because you don\u2019t have to sweep or vacuum before you use it. It does both. It vacuums while its washing your floors and area rugs, what more could you ask for? My mom loves her Crosswave Pet Pro and although it\u2019s a bit pricey, seeing her happy and making her life and work a little easier at her age is worth every dime. Thanks Bidsell, oh and Bissell, since the machine is so expensive could you make the cleaning formulas a bit cheaper? That would be a great help, especially in the times were living in today. She was also pleased to see that it came with a 3 year warranty.",

Es aspiradora con trapeador integrado \u00f1. Sirve tambi\u00e9n para limpiar tapetes y alfrombras chucos- medianos.No substituye una aspiradora dom\u00e9stica est\u00e1ndar. Esa es para trabajo pesado y para aspirar muebles, cortinas, etc por sus aditamentos y potencia.Tampoco substituye al trapeador. Esos los dejo para areas como Ba\u00f1os y escaleras y \u00e1reas peque\u00f1as donde no cabe la cabeza. Adem\u00e1s de que los trapeadores son para recoger l\u00edquidos derramados o cualquier accidente de secreciones donde no voy a usar la m\u00e1quina por obvia raz\u00f3n y cuesti\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnica de aseo de utilizar trapeadores o jergas distintas par cada tipo de superficie y de suciedad.Otra ventaja es que es muy liviana a\u00fan con los tanques de agua limpia y agua sucia medi\u00f3 llenos. Asi que subirla y bajarla es f\u00e1cil.Tambi\u00e9n fue muy \u00fatil el l\u00edquido de pisos que incluye. No hizo espuma y quit\u00f3 el olor de perro y cualquier otro de la casa. No tiene fragancia espec\u00edfica. Solo queda oliendo a limpio de una forma muy discreta. Huele neutro es la descripci\u00f3n correcta.El segundo uso fue solo con agua y tanque lleno para ver la diferencia entre con y sin soluci\u00f3n de pisos. La diferencia fue que sin soluci\u00f3n no los desengrasa/desodoriza y las manchas tardan un poco m\u00e1s en quitarse adem\u00e1s de que no limpia/desengrasa/desodoriza el tanque de agua sucia, el rodillo y la cabeza. Para la planta baja que son aproximadamente 120 mts cuadrados uso 3/4 de tanque y lave rodillo y cabeza tres veces. El tanque de agua sucia aunque no estaba lleno a tope lo vaci\u00e9 y limpi\u00e9 en cada ocasi\u00f3n.Con agua los pisos quedan igual de brilllosos como si estuvieran encerados pero rechinan de limpio. No es exageraci\u00f3n.Lo mejor fue m\u00ednimo gasto de agua y casi dir\u00eda que cero esfuerzo por que empujar la m\u00e1quina y limpiarla no te cansa para nada.Ya aprendi que solo disparas soluci\u00f3n para humedecer el rodillo. No es un spayer. Al apretar el gatillo se humedece el rodillo. De manera que el secreto est\u00e1 en saber humedecer lo lo suficiente para que talle el piso por lo que el disparo de soluci\u00f3n es intermitente. Por eso dura tanto el tanque. Es muy eficiente y rendidor si lo sabes utilizar.\u00bfY substituye a una escoba? No. La escoba y su compa\u00f1ero el recogedor son el comit\u00e9 de revision antes de usar esta m\u00e1quina. Quitan todos los detritus grandes que no son aptos para que esta. m\u00e1quina los aspire.En conclusi\u00f3n: esta m\u00e1quina es s\u00faper eficiente para limpieza diaria r\u00e1pida y efectiva de pisos duros. La desventaja es que no se le puede usar con liquidos lava pisos que hagan espuma o sean corrosivos (cloro).Queda pendiente valorar la durabilidad general y especialmente de los rodillos.",

Aparte limpiar las partes despu\u00e9s de usarla quita m\u00e1s tiempo que si hubiera barrido y trapeado. Son muchas y hay que desarmar gran parte de la aspiradora. Es un verdadero fastidio tener que hacer eso cada vez que se usa. No hice bien mi investigaci\u00f3n, hay mejores opciones",
