                "reviewText": "This a handy little vacuum cleaner, perfect for cleaning up spills and small areas. The vacuum is cordless and includes a dock for charging. The dock can be mounted on the wall for convenient charging. We had difficulty at first trying to find a place to mount the dock, as we wanted it out of the way, but it still needed to be near an electric outlet. It then dawned on us, and maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but the brush head/tube can be removed and just have the motor section on the dock for charging. This greatly opens options for mounting the dock. We put it behind our washer, which it out of the way and near an outlet, and still convenient to access (see my photo).Performance is excellent, this has great suction. Work well on hardwood floors cleaning up debris. Also worked well on our medium pile carpets. There's attachments to replace the long tube/brush head, so this can be used to clean cars and tight spaces. Emptying debris is easy, just pop open the filter cannister and dump out everything. The brush head also moves from side to side allowing good maneuverability, although a small nit pick - it would be nice to be able to lock the brush head in place because some times it get a bit floppy on carpet moving from side to side when no side movement is needed. There's a small light on the front of the brush head which is helpful. The vacuum appears to be very good quality and should be long lasting. Overall, a very convenient and capable vacuum to clean up small messes; this has my recommendation.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start out by stating how much I love this vacuum cleaner and how light it is. It is cordless. It\u2019s got an internal battery that you dock and it charges. The docking station can be hung up on the wall, which helps keep this stored and out of the way, which I absolutely love! It comes with several attachments that all fit on the storage base so you do not lose them. It swivels nicely so you can get the corners, edges, and underneath things without breaking your back. My favorite thing is that it\u2019s got a light on the vacuum so you can see everything that you\u2019re vacuuming up. The suction power is amazing, it can pick up with ease. It does take it awhile to fully charge, but that isn\u2019t an issue for me, as it takes it awhile to fully drain as well. It is easy to carry outside and use for your vehicle too due to its size and versatility. Also good for vacuuming stairways. It feels to be made of good quality.I own a Dyson stick vacuum and this vacuum here surpasses my Dyson by far. The price can\u2019t be beat for all you get & how well it works! This is an amazing deal in my opinion! I want to get my mom one due to how light it is and how well it works. I am truly impressed. You can also choose the color you want, which is another plus. There used to be 7-8 colors, now I believe they have sold out except for 2 colors. Grab one before it\u2019s too late, I promise you will not regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to start this review with some clever comment about how much this vacuum sucks (in a good way), but that would be selling this device short. It is the best cordless vacuum I have used. It has powerful suction, is easy to empty and clean, and holds a good charge for extended usage. We\u2019ve had cordless vacuums for years from Dustbuster, Bissell and several other no-name brands. This is the best of the bunch (and is reasonably priced to boot). Have never owned a Dyson, so I can\u2019t compare but this vacuum is less than 1/3 the price so even if it isn\u2019t quite as good, it\u2019s still a bargain. My only complaints after a month of ownership are that the floor head is a little too light and makes maneuvering a little bit of a challenge sometimes (the head will wander a bit on thick carpet when pushed) and because it is so light, I don\u2019t feel that it is brushing the carpet as vigorously as my heavier corded vacuum. But, I don\u2019t think it was meant as a replacement for a full size plug-in vacuum, so that is to be expected. As a supplemental stick vacuum to quickly clean up small spills and to clean the stairs it is top notch.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Assembly was very simple, and there's instructions on the canister as to how to put the handle/battery pack onto the vacuum. There are two attachments one is a brush and the other to reach narrow further places. The head swivels very easily. It also came with a brush/hook to clean the roller, a soft brush roller, and an extra filter. The roller that is in place when you receive it has stiffer bristles. I love that I don't have to hold down the power button once it's on I can concentrate on getting my floors clean, you can also use the power button to set the suction higher and when you press it a third time, it turns it off. Very easy to use and the handle can go shorter or longer depending on what you want or based even on the height of the user which is nice. The vacuum comes in different colors, I chose a deep red and it's a really pretty metallica red hue.",
