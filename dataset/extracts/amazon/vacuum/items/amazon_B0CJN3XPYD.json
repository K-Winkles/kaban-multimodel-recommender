It comes with instructions, but it goes to gether so easily they were not needed. As a bonus it comes with an extra filter. The first thing I used it on was the litter around the litter box. It is a constant problem and sweeping never gets it all, and I hate having to get the large cannister vaccum for daily touch ups. I used the crevice attachment to get in the corners around the box and this little vacuum cleaned it all up as well, if not better, than my larger vacuum. It is so easy to empty it as well, just one little lever and the cannister opens and you can easily dump the contents. I next used the floor attachment, and it made short work around my kitchen table. With it being so small I just store it in my kitchen behind my trash can. I think this will replace my broom and dust pan for those daily sweep ups. In the past I have spent three times as much for something like this and the expensive ones worked no better. This is a great value. It comes with all of the attachments needed for cleaning around the house or car.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was honestly not expecting this vacuum to excel in performance like the big-brands, but I admit I'm pleasantly surprised! It arrives in a small box for a vacuum, assembly required but it's only attaching the parts, no tools needed. Comes with 2 filters, which I was impressed with (I'm not sure if I'll be able to find this size and specific filter elsewhere) and there's no extra learning curve needed. I vacuumed behind my laundry room door, which is near the exit to the garage, so there's always a pile of dust and dirt back there. As seen in the vid, it was no effort to pick up that debris. I also took the lower floor wheeled part off and just used it as a hand vac and the suction was even stronger...this thing did the jobs! Only thing to note, is that I'm not certain how the plastic parts would hold up if you were using it like a commercial / industrial machine - but it's not meant for that. It's so lightweight you can hang it on a hook on the wall, which I will be doing in the AC closet and the cord is very long so no problem that it's not cordless. It's a higher in price than when I ordered it, but it's still competitive, I'd recommend with no doubt. If it breaks or fails, I will update this review.",
