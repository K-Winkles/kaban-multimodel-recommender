                "reviewText": "We got this because it was highly rated for use on hardwood floors. I have used it for a little while now, so here are my impressions:The good:1) The device is light and is handy for cleaning up small messes2) It has a holder that doubles as the battery charger, so the device will charge when not in use.3) it is not a deafeningly loud as many cleaners4) The off button has a satisfying \"boing\" sound when pressedThe bad:1) The collection bin is small--really small, so it fills up quickly. To make matters worse, the empty function is pretty useless, especially if there is any bit of hair in the bin. You essentially have to you have to manually clean out the bin with your fingers, which is a bit gross.2) There is no storage for the attachments. Because of this, you have to either carry them around with you, or fetch them when you need them. Even the least extensive vacuums have at least a rudimentary way of storing attachments.3) The battery life is not stellar. At this price point, I would expect the battery to last much longer. Extra batteries are available, but they are expensive--$150, if you can find them. If batteries were much, much less expensive, the battery life, might be more forgivable.4) This is only good for hard surfaces. It literally turns off if it goes across carpet. If you have that really hard carpet, like in offices, it works okay, but this device is really just for hard flooring.5) While hair doesn't really get wrapped around the rollers, it does get wrapped around the spacers on each side of the rollers. Because these spacers don't spin, I suppose that it might not mess with performance too much. However, hair still collects and there is no real easy way to clean these spaces. There are screws that may allow these to slide out for easier cleaning, but I didn't want to void the warranty or anything by trying.Summary: The ability of the head of the cleaner to move in different directions is cool and useful. Because the device is light weight, cleaning up messes doesn't feel as much of a hassle as using a full sized vacuum cleaner, or even a broom. I appreciate that hair doesn't get tangled in the actual rollers, but the fact that it wraps around the spacers is a little concerning. At the end of the day, this is basically just a really expensive sweeper.Recommendation: Despite to cool rotating head, it is much too expensive for what it is able to do. I think that most people would be happier with something else--quite honestly, if we were able to easily return ours, I probably would.",

                "reviewText": "I received this vacuum Early this year through an employee reward program from my company. Basically you save points valued at about 33 cents each. The point cost of items is normally double, if not more than retail. I explain this because I saved points for two years and was excited when this was listed. I Have owned a total of three Dysons that performed amazingly. Never had any issues I just upgraded over the years however I now had hardwood and having faith in the brand I quickly redeemed my points.I highly suggested going with a traditional model over this stick.Prosit\u2019s lightweight and the battery has yet to run out on my when vacuuming my 1200 SF of hardwood floors. It also lasted a full hour while I attempted to vacuum my relatively clean sofa.ConsThe handle is awkward and even with the lightweight your hand gets tired. It doesn\u2019t glide well at all, the rotating wheels just randomly stop in the middle of vacuuming and you have to shut unit off and turn it back on to have it rotate. If you don\u2019t it \u201cglides\u201d right over the smallest amount of dirt, dust or hair. Cat hair and dust bunnies get caught in the tiny wheels and it must be cleaned after each use. It has zero suction power. You will need to go over the same spot three times to pick up dust and the handheld attachment is awkward and doesn\u2019t work any better. It will take me an hour to vacuum my sofa crevices for cat hair.Emptying the dust container requires you to stick your hand in and pull dust out. The wall attachment for charging is plastic and cheaply made. I don\u2019t see it lasting with daily use.This vacuum does not hold up to the Dyson reputation or performance of the other three models I personally have experience using.I wish I could have returned it for the other model offered but being that I used points I was unable.",
