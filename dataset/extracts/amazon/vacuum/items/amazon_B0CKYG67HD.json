This little vac is perfect for daily cleanings. It's very light and has powerful suction. I actually enjoy zipping around the house cleaning more quickly than if I were teathered to the wall with my bulky conventional vacuum. At this price point you can't go wrong.",

I do however wish the on and off button were in a different place because I kept accidentally turning it off. That really does need to be fixed. But I can live with it since it\u2019s so powerful. I have two long hair cats and this tackled it phenomenally on the hard wood floors.",
