                "reviewText": "This is the second time I\u2019ve bought this model, the last one lasted almost 11 years. It\u2019s not heavy, easy to clean, great suction, great for dog hair, the extendable hose reaches plenty far, I like that it swivels now, and the attachments are easy to use. Great on both carpet and floors. First issue: this model no longer comes with that power brush attachment (but it looks like the Shark website may offer one for $25-$30 bucks). For a \u201cprofessional\u201d model that should handle just about anything, it\u2019s very disappointing to see that attachment no longer included. Second issue: not great on stairs. Parents and pet owners can attest to how much the stairs can take a beating sometimes. None of the attachments are ideal for the stairs, particularly for pet hair, but are ok. I\u2019m actually using my old power brush attachment (didn\u2019t fit perfectly on the new model but a little duct tape on the end of the attachment worked like a charm). Overall I would still highly recommend. We\u2019ve had Dysons before and this Shark does just as well, for half the price.",

I have owned many different brands and this one is my favorite. Its cleans great, it's pretty light weight and has multiple attachments. I also love how long the cord is. It makes life so much more simple to be able to vaccum my whole main living area carpet and tile without having to keep unplugging and plugging back in. I also love how well it works on all types of flooring. I will be devistated if they ever stop making this model lol",

The cats, while short haired, shed quite a lot and I've only just been keeping up with the shed fur with regular vacuuming, grooming and sticky rolls. In short I desperately needed a new vacuum, but which one? I could take out a thirty year mortgage and buy a Dyson, but everything I've read says that there are several very good alternatives available to this. Ok, so once again, which one? After reading Micheal Flux's(thanks Michael!) review and the fact that it's almost less than half the Dyson DC41 Animal Complete I decided to purchase the Shark.This is going to be in initial review of the machine, I'm hoping to update it as I use it more and more.First of all, I was surprised at how easy it was to put together. The unpacking took more time than the actual assembly. Second, the tools it came with are not only functional, but easy to maintain. The pet tool for example has an access hatch that allows you to clean or free anything caught on the brush. Lastly, it's lighter than I expected. I know that this may seem like a small thing, but after using it to clean my entire apartment I was glad for the lighter poundage.Ok, so now it's set up and we're ready to clean. It's very quiet as compared to my other vacuum. The swivel feature takes a little getting used to, but once you do this machine is just fantastic on floors. Cleaning up errant cat litter on hard surfaces or carpet and in between every little nook and cranny this vacuum took it all up and left nothing behind. Now it's not a miracle machine. I did have to go over some of the carpet areas more than once. Next I used the flexible brush wand to \"dust\" a bit. Window sills, curtains and ceiling corners were all left behind clean. I was impressed. But how well will it perform on my furniture. I eased into using the pet tool by vacuuming my recliner. It's a smoother cloth and the pet tool did remarkably well. No hair left behind. Ok, onto the couch and loveseat. Both collect a ton of pet hair. I put the pet tool to work and got the seat cushions and the arms of the couch. The tool is a bit large and can be tough to negotiate, but the learning curve isn't steep and I was soon cleaning everything well. On the softer back cushions it took several passes, but I expected that seeing as how the cushions are soft like pillows. I very much doubt that even the Dyson could have picked up every hair in one pass. It took a bit of time for me to finish both and as I later looked at them there was still a bit of hair on the back cushions, but I believe that to be my fault and not the vacuums.I only emptied the canister once and while it was nearly full the vacuum never hinted that it was running out of suction. It was easy to dump and then seal back up.Ok, now for the super final test. I pulled off my shoes and socks to see if I had missed anything and to see how well my new vacuum had performed. I walked everywhere I vacuumed and didn't step on one loose piece of litter. Wow!! Ok, now I'm impressed. I figured the carpeted areas would be ok, but hard floors can be difficult. I had to use a swiffer dry just to get all of the litter out of the corners when using my old vacuum. I was really impressed with the job it did on my floors.So, if you're in the market for a powerful versatile vacuum, take a serious look at the Shark.December 16, 2012 ******UPDATE!!******So after a few weeks with the Navigator I wanted to give an update. I used it a few times during the week and it gets easier to use and cleans better each time I use it. I thought that the pet brush was going to require a learning curve to use and while it does it's definitely a short one. I have been able to clean my couch, loveseat and recliner in two or three passes at this point. Now I want to give it a real workout. I let the vacuuming go for two weeks. I would dust pan up the loose litter from my cats, but no vacuuming. It was definitely a trial for all of us. At the end of two weeks I had enough shed cat hair on my couch to have made another cat and there was practically no corner of the apartment where there wasn't litter. Ok, this is a definite work out for any vacuum. I figured that there was no way that I was going to get all the cat hair up and have the floors pass my barefoot test. So I set the navigator to the task. I did have to make extra passes on the floor to get up all the litter, but it did get every piece up and the floors did pass my barefoot test. Next onto the furniture. Again extra passes were required to get at all of the cat hair and since I did let it go I had to give them an extra cleaning, but lo and behold everything is once again fur free. I am impressed. At this point I would have to wonder how much better Dyson or Miele would have to clean in order to beat the results I've been getting with the Navigator.",

                "reviewText": "My last vacuum, a brand well-known since probably before I was born, started to literally fall apart (with pieces breaking off) and then stopped working completely after less than 2 years. So, after hours of research, I decided to give Shark a try, based on its excellent reviews.Wow - - this is a great vacuum!- The suction is incredible and easily controlled on the wand to accommodate any type of floor, from plain wood to thick carpet.- The swivel feature lets me get into smaller spaces and farther under my bird cages than any upright vacuum I've had before.- The push of a button releases the wand so you can get edges and baseboards immediately.- The first time I used it, I had to empty the canister 3 times in just 2 rooms, because that's how much hair and dog fur my old vacuum had failed to pick up only a few days before!- It's not annoyingly noisy, but it is loud enough to make my macaw run through his English repertoire, in addition to some of his own Macaw-ese!- it's incredibly easy to empty the canister and to remove and wash the filters.- Switching from upright to canister mode is quick and simple. You push a button, squeeze a hose, and slip on your attachment, if you want one.- My last vacuum was a \"xxxx Pro Pet.\" I found out the reason for the name after the 3rd use - - it made each room I vacuumed smell like \"Pet,\" no matter how many times I cleaned all of the filters. My Shark gives off no odor whatsoever, as should be expected.There are a few things that make it a bit less then 5 stars, in my opinion:- First and foremost, so much hair winds around the brush/roller that I have to unwind/pick it off after every time I use it. I don't know if there's a solution to this that's absent from the design, but I've never had this problem so bad in any other vacuum.- I have to keep watching the canister to make sure the dirt is blowing around inside it, because if it stops, it means there is a clog somewhere.- The location of the power switch is a bit inconvenient for me, as I have to bend down several inches to reach it and I have a bad back. Someone shorter than 5'9\" shouldn't have a problem, though.- A retractable cord would've been nice, although the item description did warn me of this ahead of time.All in all, I love my Shark and I highly recommend it (if you don't mind the whole \"hair around the roller\" thing). It's a great product and well worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "So far I've been happy with it. It picks up cat litter with a lot less scattering than my old vaccuum and is pretty good at getting stuff at the edges of walls and in corners. The hand tools have good suction unlike my old vaccuum. The lift away canister feature is handy. I do find it feels a bit heavier to use than my old vaccuum because the full weight tilts forward onto the handle when vaccuming instead of the canister balancing on the base, but it does a good job.",

                "reviewText": "The vacuum works well and has good suction, and I like the canister removal. I bought this as a replacement for my powerhead on my built in, thinking it would be easier to move around but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s quite heavy and a pain on the stairs, and I find the cord a nuisance after being used to the built-in hose. Due to the size of my house I also have to move to different plug-ins in order to reach everywhere. If I hadn\u2019t had experience with the built-in I probably would like this more, as it really does seem to suck up a lot of dirt. The other downside is that with the canister, you can\u2019t reach underneath things like coffee tables like a can with the built-in powerhead. It\u2019s easy enough to use the lift away feature to reach underneath things and do the stairs, but it\u2019s just one more step in the vacuuming chore that is not my favourite!",
