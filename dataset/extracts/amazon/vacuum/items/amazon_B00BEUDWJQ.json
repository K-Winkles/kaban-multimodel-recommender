                "reviewText": "I am always skeptical of the products that have so many reviews and that are hyped up on social media. However I was very surprised how well this works. I have arthritis in my fingers and it is difficult for me to scrub crevices and to do a lot of housework but this took is saving my hands! It is really powerful and really digs into small areas like between faucet handles and the sink drain holes. I am actually going to buy more of them so that I can use it in kitchen and the bathroom. I even tried to use it on the soles and edges of my white Nike Air Force Ones and it was so easy to clean them!A downside of this product is it's very noisy considering how small it is.",

                "reviewText": "I am not that person who overly enjoys cleaning my bathroom, but when I turned on this scrubber and started using it on my grout (spraying with a cleaner first) I thought... wait! Are my eyes deceiving me or is this thing truly getting some stuff off the grout that I've never accomplished on my own? So I was kind of fascinated, and kept scrubbing away at different areas. Sure enough, this gadget did a good job.I would not say this is a miracle worker, since there are a few areas I will need to go back over to get that cleaner look. However, that is to be expected and not unreasonable. This scrubber does exactly as advertised on the package- faster scrubbing, less elbow grease on my part, and gets in those corners and crevices. Plus, it came with batteries and I was able to turn it on immediately. For the price, it's a win and I do recommend.",

If I notice the beginnings of mildew or soap scum while I'm in there, I fire this bad boy up and take care of it.It does a great job of getting into the corners of the tile, and around the details that my fat fingers can't clean with a regular rag.Now, for many years, we have also kept in the shower a Clarisonic face washer. It's a similar, though much higher priced, twirling brush that blasts the dirt from your pores. But about a month ago, the Clarisonic died. A few weeks after it went in the bin, my darling came downstairs, shower fresh and asked \"What's happened to the BIG face scrubber?\"I knew where this was heading.\"Do you think there's a SMALL face scrubber?\" I asked.\"Yes, but I prefer the big one. The red one takes forever to wash your face with.\"I double over laughing, but Darling's pores have never been cleaner.",
