                "reviewText": "I have had cheap cordless vacuums in the past knowing full well they typically don\u2019t clean as good as traditional plug in vacuums, but I am very happy with this vacuum! I bought it refurbished to save money and aside from some cosmetic damage, it works like it\u2019s new. The dust bin is pretty small so I empty it out after each room but that doesn\u2019t bother me at all. The run time on the vacuum is also pretty good, it lasts 30-40 minutes of continuous vacuuming. The battery does take a while to recharge again but that is technically my only \u201ccomplaint\u201d. I knocked it down from 5 stars because they *could* make a battery that lasts longer and doesn\u2019t take hours to recharge, but other than that this is a great vacuum!",

                "reviewText": "I loved the fact that as an 86 year- old- woman, it is light and manueverable. But it doesn't stay on after I takke the battery off and wait a couple of hoours to start it up again. It dies shortly after again.. This isn't working for me or for anyone else.I really didn't know when I ordered it that it was repaired. I did check with vacuum handimen who repair them, but the cost is almost $50. That is not the price I should have to pay to have a new and working vacuum cleaner. Plus, suction power isn't good either.I could send it off to the original refurbishers but the cosst of mailing and also working on it, is even greater than leaving it with a vacuum handman in town.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s certainly not a top of the line model, but it was priced right, portable, cordless, and seems to do the job as intended. It is a little loud, but I didn\u2019t by a whispering vacuum so I can tolerate that. It will last a full 40 mins in between charges and with that said, if you vacuum for more than 40 mins straight you need to find a new hobby!! Emptying the waste canister is a little on the complicated side in my non-Harvard opinion, but works just fine once you do it a couple times. Overall, it was a great buy for the 1200 sq Ft of carpet that was crying from all the crumbs and muck my children love to try and feed it. It was either the vacuum or a dog, and I chose the vacuum and am happy with my purchase.",
