                "reviewText": "I have a 2 story home with hardwood floors on the entire lower level. It's super light weight and easy to grab for a quick daily vacuum of my downstairs. I am happy to keep this vacuum on hand in my down stairs closet so I don't have to drag my heavier Dyson downstairs every time I want to clean. You need to go over some areas a few times to pick up visible dust or crumbs and it doesn't hold a full charge for too long, but long enough to get a quck clean up done. I've also used it on flat area rugs and it works well. In addition, it's great to use on furniture! I'm happy I puchased this and would recommend it as an inexpensive cleaning tool.",

                "reviewText": "My wife is confined to a wheelchair, but is insistent upon doing some of the work around the house. The corded Shark vacuum is good but difficult to maneuver from the wheelchair. She had a Dirt Devil corded stick vacuum, but, again it was difficult to maneuver from a wheelchair plus its canister would just fall off, dumping what you had just vacuumed into the floor again. The had a lighting deal on this rechargeable stick vacuum by Prettycare and the reviews were pretty good. It turned out to be a blessing. It is light, well balanced, easy to use with a myriad of adjustments which turned out to be the greatest asset that this machine has, which is the ability to adjust the length. This alone was invaluable. I have to hand it to Prettycare for a great product!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my second stick vacuum I\u2019ve bought from PrettyCare, the first one I had for about a year and a half but unfortunately the battery life started to diminish. I reached out to PrettyCare and they were incredibly helpful and responsive and offered to send me this newer version free of charge. I\u2019ve been using it for about a week and I\u2019m very impressed! For the price you really can\u2019t beat it, its battery lasts long enough to clean both floors of my house and still be running. It has a light that turns on that is super convenient for seeing hair/dust that you can\u2019t usually see. I have 2 cats so litter and hair is a nuisance and pulling out a big vacuum that needs to be plugged in is a real pain so this makes cleaning quick and easy. I\u2019m very impressed with the quality at such a low price and after how responsive and helpful their support team was I will continue to stick with this brand.",

                "reviewText": "I had been using a variety of methods of cleaning my floors until I discovered this Pretty Care vacuum. It is lightweight enough to use with one hand, has a wall storage clamp, and two attachments, one for narrow spaces and corners and another for upholstery of wall webs and pet hair. It is easy to use because it's cordless and just powerful enough to do bare floors and thin rugs like in the bathroom. It charges fairly quickly and holds enough charge to do my 1200 sq ft home. The only drawbacks are that the battery is not removable and thus not replaceable, so when the battery gives out you have to purchase a new unit. It is also, as I said, \"just powerful enough.\" It does have 2 speeds, but the lower one I have not found a use for. Perhaps for curtains, which I don't have, or a keyboard, which I haven't tried. Overall, I am very pleased.",

I have an 800 sqft apartment and I\u2019m able to vacuum the entire place with one charge. I use power 2 off and on throughout. I think both power levels work well. I would recommend this for spaces less than 1000 sqft, or buy more than one! Price and value are great.",
