                "reviewText": "I should qualify my review by saying that this purchase replaced an ancient vacuum for me, so anything probably would've been better than what I had. But I love this little vacuum. And you cannot beat that price. I'm very impressed with the suction power. It works great on my tile floors, my low pile carpet, and my shaggy area rug. And it's super easy to move from one type of flooring to another. My dog sheds a lot, and it's embarrassing how much hair (and dirt) this thing removed. It fits all the way under every piece of furniture, which is so helpful for truly ridding the house of dog hair. It handles so well and I love how easy it is to maneuver around.Addressing some complaints of other customers:1) It does not stand on its own, but it does lay flat. So if you have to move furniture or stop midway to empty the cannister, you just lay it down...easy peasy.2) The cannister is pretty small, but it is super easy to remove and empty. And as long as I'm vacuuming as frequently as I should, I can vacuum my 2,000 sq ft home without having to empty the cannister. (I did have to empty frequently on my first use since this thing picked up way more than my old vacuum.)3) I found the chord to be the perfect length. Any longer and it would be too cumbersome. I can do all the living areas without moving the plug. It only has to be moved to reach the bedrooms.4) The motor is on top, so that does make the vacuum top heavy. But I think that makes it easier to maneuver, and its not so heavy as to make my arm tired, even when vacuuming the entire house. If you have trouble managing this vacuum, you would be better off with a roomba.5) But the reason I could sadly only give this product 4 starts...it does squeak. Loudly. :( The sound is akin to an entire basketball team squeaking new shoes on a gym floor. I have 2 very loud kids, so I have no problem tuning out the sound. But I could see it being a major issue for others. I like the vacuum enough to keep it anyway, but I will look for ways to stop the squeaking.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Holy waste of money! 4 months in and the roller has literally melted in the head. I can't even use this thing anymore. I am incredibly disappointed in the product. I usually love Bissell vacuums!With the mixed reviews this vacuum got I was skeptical but took a chance since I love my Crosswave. Holy cow! This thing is awesome! So let me address some of the concerns that caught my attention:It doesn't stand on its own: no it doesn't, but the first item you pull out of the box is a wall mount.The tank isn't large enough: umm how dirty is your floor? I vacuumed an almost 900 sq ft trailer and sucked up a bunch of cat litter that had been hiding and had room to spare.The wheels are squeaky: yeah they are but not annoyingly so.It doesn't go straight: it takes some finessing I'll give ya that. A slight lean to the left or right and its heading that way. Treat it like driving a car and you'll be fine. I liked how touchy it was.If you've gotten this far, let me tell you a feature I found that I don't recall seeing in the description: it has a hard floor and carpet setting that sits right by your thumb. You can change the floor type with hardly any effort. That is amazing. It's light, compact and sucks way harder then I expected. Worth every penny!!!!",

                "reviewText": "We have 2 dogs that shed VERY much & with me bring OCD about dog hair flooding my house, I have purchased numerous different vaccums over the last few years, including Dyson, Shark & a few other name brands. So when I was looking to purchase a new one, I spent hours looking at reviews for this one & I am SO glad I went with it! I swear it works better than all my previous vaccums including my Dyson that I spent over $500 on & it didn't even last 2 years & I didn't want to pay that kind of money again... PLUS... the suction on this one is incredible!!! I usually vaccum 1-2 times a week, so you'd think there wouldn't be so much damn dog hair!! I was mind blown with this vaccums capabilities & let me tell you... I was shook when I vacuumed only one floor of my 3 story home!! The pictures I've posted are literally after I had just vacuumed a few days prior with my Shark pet hair vaccum... pictures are worth 1000 words! So get one!! Oh & let me mention the warranty & customer service!! I originally bought my vaccum about 6 months ago & registered the warranty online & about 2 weeks ago, one of the parts on the roller broke & the company immediately sent a replacement that arrived 2 days later!!",
