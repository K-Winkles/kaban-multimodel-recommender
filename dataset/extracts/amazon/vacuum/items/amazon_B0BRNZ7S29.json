It has a nice blue light effect all around the hand held part and lights on the front of the power head attachment so that you can see the dirt you are vacuuming The cord is super long so you can cover a lot of distance without having to unplug and move the cord. When you remove the extended bar in the middle, it becomes a hand-held vacuum and is very light if you use one of the attachments. The weight in this vacuum is the power head. It can slip into a closet easily and the best part is that all of the filters actually wash out easily in the sink. It is so quick to empty the dirt cup also. Dog hair cleaning is a cinch with this machine, I love it.",

                "reviewText": "Got this to replace a 15 year old Shark vacuum. The old one seemed to have asthma and was tired. Well, we're all getting old and tired aren't we? This one is WOW. I am very happy with it, so much so that I am willing to forgive it for not being able to stand up unsupported. I was wary of it having the air freshener cartridge, but found it to not be annoying at all, and it doesn't make me sneeze! That's a plus. The suction on this is amazing. Having three cats and one of them being a Maine Coon who is currently in shedding season, I'm finding this vacuum super easy to just pull out of the closet 2 or 3 times a day to adios a trail of Rocky fur balls. The vacuum does have a learning curve to it, though. It is top-heavy, having the motor on top, rather than have it situated on bottom with the stick and handle on top. It's off balance and takes a bit of getting used to. The maneuverability of this vacuum is amazing, and at first I thought it was the straight back and forth like I was used to until I twisted it and it turned. I was all, \"Wait, what?\" This is a really easy vacuum to use. Now I need to find some specialty attachments for it....",

                "reviewText": "My friend convinced me to spend a little more on a quality stick vacuum and insisted that it would make vacuuming a less onerous chore. She was right! I have three dogs and a cat. The cord is nice and long so I\u2019m not moving it all the time, light weight and very maneuverable, sucks up hair like a boss. I can easily move from the carpeted to hardwood and tile areas of my house. I\u2019m so glad I made this purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Effective but has some cons",
                "reviewText": "Pros: strong power/suction even in a pet friendly home, easy to empty, various attachments, corded so no worries of the battery wearing out. The flat fuzzy brush is really good on blinds. The pivot features on the bottom floor part are really easy to use.Cons: The two big things I don't like about this vacuum are that it doesn't stand up independently and it's hard to prop it up when not in use, even if just for a minute. It constantly falls down and is awkwardly weighted. The exhaust vents are also awkwardly placed so I often find myself getting blown in the face with hot vacuum air when I'm trying to move things out of the way or clean at any kind of angle, which really grosses me out because I feel like that air just had contact with the dirt I'm vacuuming up. It's also kind of heavy, and the functions aren't always intuitive or well marked when you want to remove the floor part to switch to handheld. I also wish there was a way to shorten the tube for handheld use, which is what I expected when I bought it. It's a nice vacuum but I wouldn't buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "It has been a good vacuum...but, with the small capacity I think it's a bit over priced. I feel this vaccuum shouldn't be over $100. Pros: Good leverage with swivel head for reaching places. Lightweight and easy to use. Sufficient suction power-but nothing amazing. Cons: Small capacity dirt trap/container. You can't stop vacuuming and pick something up/move furniture without it toppling over (top heavy when vacuum is attached)-you'd have to shut off and hang the detachable vacuum on the peg it is meant to hang on for storage...you also can't store any other way or it will fall over.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a dirt devil stick and it is 1000x better. Great suction and very maneuverable to go under furniture and around corners. It unhooks for a hand held and has a few attachments.Only down sides, it blows very hot when you are using it, and it doesn\u2019t stand up independently. Neither are deal breakers and it is well worth it.",
