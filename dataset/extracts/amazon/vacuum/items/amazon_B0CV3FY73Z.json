                "reviewText": "My wife found one of these for $400. Said that's what she wanted for Christmas. I'm thinking, for that kind of money we could own a Hoover! Or one of those robotic cleaners. But she said this design allows her to clean under the bed. Honestly, I don't think much about what's under the bed, but she's a bit obsessive about that sort of thing. When I found this one at less than half the price of the one she picked out, I convinced her to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I had snapped it all together how well made this vac is. Its got plenty of suction and its the lightest vac I've had the pleasure to heft. With several attachments in addition to the regular wide mouth vac head, it will do window sills, curtains and gets way up under the furniture where the dust bunnies burrow. And it's rechargeable. The battery life depends on which of two speeds you want to run it on. The lower suction does a pretty good job and allows longer operating time. Oh, I almost forgot. It's got headlights! You wouldn't think that would be a big deal, but I was shocked how much additional debris shows up when you cast a light on the subject. She's happy, I'm happy, we're happy and I have some money left over to get her something she would really like. Like a fishing pole or a new pair of waders.",
