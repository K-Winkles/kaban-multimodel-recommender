                "reviewText": "I only had this nice vacuum a few days and used it once on my hardware floors and 8 X 10 carpets. Will probably give it 5 stars in my next review (too soon for that rating) and do have a few recommendations so far. It's not a heavy-duty vacuum and purchased it for something quick and easy to use for everyday light cleaning (I do have a heavy-duty vacuum also for heavier vacuuming once in a while).The vacuum is light, easy to set up, seems sturdy, can stand by itself against the wall, excellent 18 ft. electric cord, and good suction power on both hardwood and small carpets - exactly what I was hoping for. The brush turns nicely by motor power, not by air pressure as some models do. The following recommendations are minor, nice to have in future versions and not meant to be-little this so far nice vacuum:1. Would be nice to have an additional button to turn on-off the brush (might help picking up matter from the hardwood floors but up to Bissell engineers to test this feature).2. The vacuum handle is very smooth and allows the vacuum to twist in your hand easily. It would be nice to roughen this up a little so you have a little firmer grip that would help keep it from twisting left or right in your hand. Not a big deal but nice to have and should be an easy enhancement.3. It would be nice to have a way to attach the Crevice tool (included for vacuuming hard-to-reach spaces and messes) to the vacuum when not in use. The Crevice tool comes with the vacuum but sometimes I can't remember where I left it from my last use of it. A quick plastic hook or catch on the handle would be nice, where it becomes part of the vacuum you carry around. As a temporary measure, I attached a piece of Velcro to the lower part of the long handle and a piece to one of the back sides of the Crevice tool and that seems to work fine (always know where I put it last). I am sure the Bissell engineers can find a little better solution. Should be an easy enhancement.4. In addition to the Crevice tool, it would be nice to have a little brush attachment to vacuum furniture, for cat hair, etc. Not a big deal either but nice to have.5. Would be nice to be able to hang on a closet wall. Could we please have some small plastic wall hanger, that can be screwed onto the wall to enable it to be hung from the wall. Doesn't need to be much of a hanger and not everybody would need or want it, but a nice, inexpensive addition for the unit.6. Would be nice if the revolving brush mechnesim would swivel left and right. I had used this feature on a previous vacuum and loved it as I could reach awkard areas.7. I still can't give this vacuum five stars as it could use more suction power. It does clean but I never feel the floors are really that clean. A little more suction power would be really nice but I guess that would compete with your more expensive vacuums. I purchased this vs. a cordless for the purpose of getting more power and of course use time. Unfortunately, power wise, it is comparable to an inexpensive cordless. Having used this now, and it does do a fair job, I would have returned it and reconsidered a cordless but my return policy has expired.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is great on stairs when you are not using the plastic attachment. It is super light weight and has great suction. It is not so great on carpets. It barely wants to roll, so you are constantly fighting it, even on fairly solid carpets it wants to get stuck . The brush does not rotate at all; it is just there for looks and nothing more.However, I think the low price and the suction power help to salvage it, so I give it a 3 out of 5 review. It will get the job done, just don't expect it to gracefully glide around your floors.",

                "reviewText": "Not sure how it works, because I ordered one that was purported to be \"like new, but the package was damaged.\" Whoever returned it, returned it broken (dust cup isn't held in place) and nobody checked it before sending it out again. So it's going back, even though it's broken. I offered to just throw it away here and save the return shipping, as well as someone's time to check it for damage--although that probably wouldn't happen anyway, now that I see how returns are handled. They said to send it back anyhow. Go figure.But FYI, the entire unit is plastic. Maybe it's lightweight that way, but it seems flimsy and fragile. Also loud, because I turned it on for a moment to note the amount of sound it made. Personally, I'd spend a few more dollars and try for better quality.",
