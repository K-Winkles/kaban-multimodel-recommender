                "reviewText": "My husband does all the vacuuming in our home and when he wanted this for his birthday, I thought he was nuts. I've had other rechargeable small vacuum cleaners and none of them had any suction at all. They might pick up dust and that's about it - anything heavier than a feather, forget it. This vacuum is small, easy to handle, and has suction power as good as our full-sized electric Dysons and Sharks. The charge doesn't last long due to the suction power, so he vacuums just one room at a time. It's lightweight enough that even I can use it for small jobs (I'm disabled and not able to push a full-sized vacuum.) My husband gets a big kick out of watching it suck the accumulated debris into the disposal receptacle when he puts it on the charger. We're very happy with this purchase. Not sure how long it will last but hoping it's durable and will keep its effectiveness for a few years.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Feel like this thing is getting all kinds of dust that\u2019s usually hassle areas to clean. Extensions are easy to swap out, easy to get cobwebs from corners and close to the baseboard where carpet meats with the thin extension, straighten up the baseboards, ac registers and air intake vents with the bristle extension. The detection is nice for moving from Carpet to ceramic, it auto adjusts smoothly. Pretty lightweight. It will let you know if there is a clog in the tubing by flashing red and turning the battery indicator off, it was easy to disassemble clear the clog and resume cleaning. Don\u2019t recommend using it for the fireplace the fine particles clog the suction quickly not repeating that again. Small downside is the battery, really wish the battery lasted a little longer, but I\u2019ll take it over fighting with a coord. I may look into getting an extra battery it\u2019s similar to a drill batter. If you made it this far thanks for reading hope your day/night is well.",

                "reviewText": "They advertised a run time of about 45 minutes. Lies! I've pulled this bad boy off the charger, fully charged, and lost juice in a matter of minutes. Even though the battery is BS, I still love it. I have a small apartment, so it doesn't bother me too much. I'm able to vacuum what I want before it dies. The auto clean system is what saves this. It's lightweight for the most part but the handle can get a little heavy. All parts, including the charging base, are easy to assemble/dissemble. The suction is crazy powerful and it even picked up trash on the edges/corners of walls/floors. It has a sensors and an auto detect feature that automatically changes the suction power based on what's being picked up. I hate the batter, but I love the vacuum as a whole.",

                "reviewText": "This vacuum is freakin amazing. Love the features it has and ease of use. It feels like the floor was mopped it gets it so clean with the quad clean roller. Super easy to maneuver and get under edges, under and around furniture, and even easy to pick up and vacuum the tops of furniture.- \"Detect\" mode is awesome. Really does detect the dirt and ramps up the speed accordingly. Has a light sensor on the roller base AND on the handle to visually see the dirtiness which is helpful if you can't visually see it on the surface, like when vacuuming carpet or couches or beds.-Edge sensors work great.-Light is awesome (gets brighter in dark areas).-Auto Empty system is probly the BEST part of this entire system. I can't wait to finish vacuuming just to see it empty. Lol. Some would say the auto empty system is counterintuitive, which I thought initially as well, but it really is great. Supposed to last 30 days before emptying. Which is great because after vacuuming you just throw it on the dock and you're done. Says its good for up to 30 days before emptying(although I'll probly empty it and clean it once a week or maybe bi-weekly at most).Cleaning it is a little bit of a task. I have an air compressor so I just take it outside and blow it all out. Be prepared because the filters are super dirty and dust will go everywhere. Especially the filter in the handle. Just pulling it out releases a ton of dust and dirt all over you and all over the floor. So take it outside if you can. I blow the roller head all out, the filter and canister in the handle, and the multiple filters in the empty base as well as the large canister. -1 star;Extra batteries arent available (yet?). Battery life is... decent. Lasts a good while in detect mode. I only ran out of battery the first two uses, but now that I've cycled the battery a few times it seems to last a LOT longer and haven't ran out of battery again. I have a pretty small house though so larger houses would be difficult to finish on a whole battery. The \"detect\" mode seems to be the sweet spot for battery life. Turbo mode really ramps up the speed and seems too fast. Feels like a carpet mode. \"Eco\" mode is worthless. Barely spins or vacuums at all. I would have much rather had a medium mode; detect/medium/turbo. Their claimed 60 minute runtime is probly on eco mode, which I doubt it would last that long, but let's be honest eco mode is useless and no one will use it..-1 star;Vacuum went on sale cheaper than it was during black friday and cyber monday when I purchased mine, just days later. Really Shark? Really? I feel like I got got. What are these sales coming to? I saw the supposed black friday \"scams\" and marketing ploys they're doing in stores now but didn't think this was the case with online shopping too. Sigh oh well. Not gonna stress about $30. You'll just get a star docked for that sneaky lil move. Lol.",
