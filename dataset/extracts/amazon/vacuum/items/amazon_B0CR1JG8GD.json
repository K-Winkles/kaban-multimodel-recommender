                "reviewText": "Ok, y'all. This vacuum may be small, but it definitely gets the job done for quick cleanups and is used DAILY in our household.I've had multiple handheld vacs over the years, but none with such a sleek design like this one. And with the design, let's take about the built-in hidden feature... the blower/duster! It has to be the best part of this small cordless vac. Not only does it keep you cooler when using in vacuum mode (as it'll blow air out of the back and help cooler you off if you're tidying up the car on a hot day). But wait! That blower/duster has attachments that fit and allows you to clean hard to reach items... like keyboards, buttons in your car, the back of electronics. Once you blow the dust away, you're able to quickly and simply vacuum up the dust with no issues.If you wanted to take a look and see if there's anything needing to be vacuumed, there's a built-in light on the body that will help highlight the dusty areas in need of some additional attention. I always appreciate a built-in light, as I find it fascinating just how much dust settles even over a couple of days.The attachments are great, and all serve their appropriate purpose. There's really nothing I have found that I need that they didn't already include in the attachments. (Note: the circular attachments go on the blower end, while the more oblong attachments go to the vacuum end).I am extremely happy with this, especially as a parent of two kiddos under 7 years old. It's so handy to use this handheld vac when needing to get crumbs out of the backseat rather than getting out the ShopVac or make the trip to the car wash. Convenience is essential for a busy mom and dad.Would I recommend this item? ABSOLUTELY!!Is this giftable? YES! I would LOVE to receive something like this, as it has such versatile usage (ie: home, office, car).Is it priced appropriately? YES. Especially considering this comes with some great attachments that serve various applications for usage.",

                "reviewText": "wow! i was VERY pleasantly surprised by this mini vacuum!i will be completely honest and say that at first, i got very frustrated with it. it has blower or vacuum capabilities, and to use the vacuum aspect of it, you need to put on the filter and end-cap to hold every thing that gets sucked up. well, the instructions for that part STINK. for the life of me, i could not figure out how to get it to go on and stay put. i eventually discovered that you needed to pop off a part on one end, in order to put the vacuum part on.after i figured that out, i put it on to charge, which is did quickly and easily with no issues.the vacuum has THREE levels of power, which is probably my favorite feature. sometimes, you just need a bit more 'umpf' to pick up crumbs or whatever may be vacuumed, especially in smaller places where the vacuum may not exactly fit. this worked very nicely to pick up any and everything that i tried to vacuum up. i was especially surprised at the size of some of the things it picked up, including several juice box straw wrappers from my children.it comes with several attachments, a charging cord, and an easy clean filter, as well.it has a light as well, and i love that it has a light-indicator for the battery, which lets me know when it's time to throw it on the charger.overall, for the value, this is a GREAT product.5 STARS!",

                "reviewText": "This comes with a multitude of different attachments for different jobs. This is both a handheld vacuum and a mini blower combined. This is perfect for small jobs around your house, in your car or for use with your computer components. I use this to vacuum my car's air vents, cup holders, side door compartments, etc. Around the house I use this to vacuum dust around the windows, floor corners and on the sheves, etc. It works great to vacuum my computer keyboard and blow the dust off my computer internal components. This mini vacuum has so many uses and as long as you use it for small jobs it performs great. It is easy to clean to, you just pop off the filter cover and clean the filter when dirty. The only negative is that nowhere in the instructions or their posted video do they tell you how to convert it from a vacuum to a blower. It took me a few seconds to figure it out but it seems other reviewers had the same problem. All you need to do is look at my photos. On one side you attach the vacuum attachments. On the opposite side you attach the blower attachments. Pretty simple.",
