                "reviewText": "Bought just after Black Friday/Cyber Monday for 36% off, $90. First impression when I unboxed it and inserted the shaft and tightened the screw, was that each part looked squeaky clean (which is good as it means I didn\u2019t receive a used vacuum) but at the same time made the vacuum look like a hunk of cheap plastic. I was wrong about the last part though, as after vacuuming a room\u2019s rug (with the vacuum set at 2-low carpet), I certainly felt the plastic was strong and sturdy to handle the powerful suction enough to realize this was a good purchase. I attached photos of what collected in the bagless dust bin after just vacuuming a small room. TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY. No more buying those small vacuums where the head can twist and turn in 180degrees. Onto the bad part: when I inserted the bin and clicked it in place on the vacuum, I inspected the duct that connects the hose to the bin, and saw it does not line up perfectly. In fact, there is a tiny gap where small amounts of dust can escape, so hopefully that doesn\u2019t become a problem in the future. As for now this experience taught me it works really well so I have hope.",

I did all the rugs and two carpeted bedrooms and the container was nearly half filled. Superb vacuum cleaner. The self-winding chord can be fussy at times. I found that it rewinds best if you gently pump the lever with your foot.",

Cord retract is a little slow/lazy but just keep it pushed down it retracts slowly but surely so far (the future?). Caught it at a good price better than my last vacuum (lower price point) let's see if it lasts as long as my last hoover I bough in 2000/2001 and lasted 20 years (maybe longer given a shot) my girlfriend wanted a newer vacuum which only lasted a couple of years. I've had good experiences with hoover vacuums my entire life and hope this one continues the tradition for years to come as I sail closer and closer to senior citizenship. Ownership: 2 or 3 month at the time of this review.",

Feels lighter weight too. i wanted the same vac and this one is great....",

                "reviewText": "I had a 12amp Wind Tunnel that I'd had for about two years that, despite the screws breaking off when I tried replacing the belt in AGAIN, I loved how well it worked.I bought this one, based upon the 12amp answer that someone gave about it. When it was delivered I discovered that it is actually a 10amp. I decided, though, to at least give it a try, before returning it.When I vacuumed my carpet (which my entire apartment is) it vacuumed up so much stuff I thought it was tearing up my carpet. As it turned out, it was actually vacuuming up what my previous vacuum cleaner had started leaving behind.Since I've owned this one, my carpet has never felt and looked so clean. It works as good my old steel vacuum cleaner (I paid hundreds for), and it isn't as bulky and heavy.It has more bristles than my last Hoover, and more suction power, so it gets everything in one pass. And it has no problem vacuuming up pet hair. I have Belgian Malinois who sheds constantly (despite regularly brushing), so I vacuum almost daily. It gets every bit of her hair easily.The hose is super flexible and easy to work with cleaning ceiling fans, vents, and blinds. No more having to dust those first. I can do them all all at once.It works amazingly well on regular floors, without kicking back and throwing stuff out the back end.All in all...it is the best and most awesome vacuum cleaner I've ever owned. The price is a huge bonus.I highly recommend it!!!On a side note...1) The canister really should be emptied after each vacuuming. I, personally, also always brush mine with a bottle brush to keep it from clogging, and so I don't have to wash it as often. The hose, canister, and filter should be washed regularly. Otherwise that's what causes that nasty vacuum cleaner smell...you don't want your home smelling like when you vacuum.I also fully extend the hose and replace it, before emptying the canister, to get out anything that might be caught between the grooves of the hose.2) To keep the Cord Rewind working properly, the cord shouldn't be pulled out much further past the yellow warning, and especially not past the red warnings that it has. And, the cord should be untwisted before, or as you're rewinding it, so it rewinds as it should.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",
