                "reviewText": "*did not receive a free anything for this review*Contrary to the comments of one poster who is claiming that positive reviews are not genuine.Just received this today, so obviously long term performance is as yet undetermined. That said, so far, I'm impressed.My first thought when using it was that someone actually cared about the design and ease of use. I want to mention that this comes with instructions that actually make sense.I used this on tile floors, luxury vinyl floors and a bit of carpet. I was impressed.Battery : Held up nicely with excellent power throughout entire use.Charging:You'll see 1,2,3 on the top of the battery, and depending on how much of a charge is needed, you will see one of those numbers blinking as it is in the charging process.I definitely appreciate that there is no guesswork in determining how long the battery needs to be charged.Disconnecting and connecting the battery couldn't be easier, it has a drop in slot at the top, where with the push of the button the battery can slide in or out as needed.Is it heavy?I found this vacuum to be very easy to handle, not heavy, but not so lightweight that it didn't feel substantial. Does it fall over?Vacuum stands on its own without sliding to the floor or tipping over. Another design feature that makes using this vacuum a pleasure.How is the suction? Suction was excellent. You will notice there are three settings for suction, each one did its job and I have to note that the noise level was excellent, far less than a stick vacuum I had had several years ago, which sounded like a rocket launch.Can I adjust the height?Yes it adjusts easily. This was an unexpected but welcomed feature.Does it clog ? At no point in my vacuuming did I encounter any clogs. The tubing seems to be pretty wide and allowed for debris to flow easily into the waste cup.And this was impressive considering the amount of crud that was under our couch.It vacuumed all of it easily, and nothing clogged.How do you empty it? With the touch of a button. No struggling.I love that I didn't have to remove the cup from the stick. This vacuum allows you to simply press a button to open the bottom of the cup directly over your garbage can.Yet another example of thoughtful design.I imagine in the coming months I'll probably add to this review to address durability.I cannot honestly note any negatives and can only say that this absolutely has exceeded my expectations.Before making this purchase, I looked at reviews of a number of top stick vacuums both corded and uncorded. I read consumer sites, retail sites, I read everything. And the funny thing was none of those expensive top of the line brands, with their super high price tags seemed to offer what this could for a fraction of the cost.Bottom line: Excellent product and I'm glad that I bought it.Jan 2024 update: Still delighted with this Orfeld!In fact, I purchased another for my 94 yr old parents, who live independently & still want to do as much as they can manage, themselves. Excellent for any solid surface floor & cleanups on carpet. They love it!Feb 2024: this little Orfeld is still a delight to use. One of the best purchases we've ever made!",

                "reviewText": "This is my second cordless vacuum cleaner. The V16 Pro is the latest Orfeld model in 2023. It has all three features that I require in a cordless vacuum. It is self standing, has a removable battery, and LED lights to show what you\u2019re vacuuming. The V16 Pro also has a telescoping pole, which I find very useful. It picks up everything quite well. The floor brush doesn\u2019t swivel much, but that doesn\u2019t lessen its effectiveness.The real benefit of the V16 Pro is that it has an advanced filtration system that emits purified air back into the room. That\u2019s a characteristic of far more expensive cordless vacuum cleaners. The dirt canister is small but it traps all the dirt and dust in it. I have used the vacuum three times and the round black pre filter and HEPA filter above the canister have remained clean despite doing the entire house. That\u2019s a sign that the filtration system is doing a great job.An extra HEPA filter is included with the V16 Pro. If you want to order extra HEPA filters, do an Amazon search on \u201cOrfeld B08 Filter.\u201d That filter is identical to the one in the V16 Pro and fits perfectly. I ordered a four pack and those filters match the supplied HEPA filters exactly.The large battery seems like it will last a long time. I sent an email to Orfeld tech support asking if this battery is in stock and can be ordered, but haven\u2019t heard back yet. The LED display on the battery shows the three power selections for the vacuum. It\u2019s quite helpful and easy to read while vacuuming.The other LED display shows the battery level in percentages, and gives warnings when the floor brush is tangled or the canister is full. That\u2019s something more expensive cordless vacuums don\u2019t offer.All in all, the Orfeld V16 Pro is the latest model in 2023 and offers enough suction power. It only weighs 6.4 pounds and is light enough so that my back and arm don\u2019t ache after I have finished vacuuming the entire house, even under the beds. The V16 Pro offers everything the higher priced models do and has several useful features that they don\u2019t offer. I think the V16 Pro is a good value for the money and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "It is too small to be the only vacuuming source in the house unless you have a small place or you\u2019re just looking to do a quick cleanup of a few rooms or area, but it is an excellent little vacuum. I think the only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the battery life.It is very compact, super easy to use & swivels easily once you get the hang of it.When you turn it on the default speed is always 2 (has 3 speeds), I used it on this speed (2) once I fully charged the battery & it only lasts 15 minutes. I use it daily & it is always the same.The company sent me another battery & once fully charged I used it on speed 1 & the maximum you can get out of the charge is 25 minutes. It does great a picking up at all speeds, I\u2019m using it on hardwood floors & small rugs.I love that all attachments can be rinsed off & that if anything gets stuck ( in my case, tape) you can simply starts detaching parts with a simple touch of a button & you can see & remove the blocked object, even the base of it can be rinsed off with ease, just as with any vacuum, the hairs need to be removed, a little tool is included for this.I have been using it for a month on a daily basis & I am impressed at how much it picks up every single day in a home with just two of us! I can\u2019t wait to see what the battery life will be.I do recommend & love this product .",

It dies an exceptional job with pulling in debris that close to a wall and I very much like the swivel brush head. It's lite and comfortable in my hand. For the price, I'd recommend it.",
