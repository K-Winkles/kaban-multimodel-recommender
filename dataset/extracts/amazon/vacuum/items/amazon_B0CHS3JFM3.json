                "reviewText": "First let me say I was not expecting much because I did not know this brand. So taking it out of the box, putting it together using it for the first time\u2026 I was looking for things I did not like, and they just didn\u2019t come. I am absolutely wild by this little machine. The suction on it is very strong so unless you have a tight knit rug, I would not use this on carpet or things like that. But for a hardwood floors, oh my gosh, it\u2019s the best thing ever. It\u2019s so lightweight, and transitions to the other options so easily. I usually find it cumbersome to break apart to use the hand vac etc., but this is an easy push of the button and you\u2019re done. I thought I finally found something wrong in that it was too short, and I found myself wishing it was a little longer as I used it, and then, as I was putting it away, I realized I missed a little extension button, so you can completely adjust its height. It\u2019s very lightweight which is cool , it stands on its own even cooler, and though mine doesn\u2019t have cord wraps, it goes around the top of it just fine. Because it\u2019s so thin and compact it goes underneath even my lowest nightstands, you can get to the wall with just about any piece of furniture with this thing and not have to move it! I could not love this vacuum more . I hope it holds up!!! ONLY complaint is the attachment for the handvac piece does not stay on the stick very well. Nicely made & thought out for the design!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Let me just say how much I love this vacuum. I recently switched over from having a cordless vacuum but unfortunately after three months, the battery would not stay charged as long, so I was not able to finish vacuuming some of the rooms in my house before the battery would die. This vacuum, however does have a long cord which makes it nice to go room to room. It\u2019s lightweight, the suction is powerful for as small as it is, I haven\u2019t had any issues with it leaving hair or debris that it couldn\u2019t pick up either on carpet or hardwood floors. It\u2019s quieter than most vacuums I\u2019ve owned, and really light weight. I love the fact that you can use it at it\u2019s full length or just use the provided attachments to vacuum the couch, or even your car, which works amazing in all of the crevices. I love the fact that it can stand up on it\u2019s own (however, I am cautious as I do not want to tip over and cause damage to it) so I put it in a hard surface standing up. It also works great on hardwood floors and tile.. The pivotal head with head light gets in all of the small areas you can\u2019t get to or see and the fact that I can vacuum underneath my couch is amazing. I do not own pets however, I have used it to vacuum up pet hair for a family member\u2019s dog, and it worked great. It even picks up sand from children\u2019s shoes. Overall I\u2019m extremely pleased with it especially considering the price point.",

The cord is pretty long too!More a backup vacuum rather than a full time ya vacuum lol",

Good price(got on Black Friday for 75$), suction is good, looks good (got in color white and it is white and black so not as light grey as it shows in the cover photo which is fine because I like the black more), has a light which I love to see dust, cord is a good length(found that cord is better than battery powered as those tend to have less suction power and die overtime faster), light weight and not too heavy and stands on its own. Easy to empty. Good for pet owners as there aren\u2019t too many bristles works great I have a dog and three cats.",

The locks for the joints broke first then the whole wand got flimsy and weak feeling. I've only had it 2 months. Not sure it will make it 3The filter clogs up nearly immediately and is tough to clean. Not sure why so much dirt gets all the way inside but it doesThe cord is a tad shortThe base is a little heavy for lifting while using the dust brushWhile it can work on carpet, I wouldn't use this as my only vacuum for wall to wall. It does a great job on other floors (versatile with tile, laminate, wood, concrete, etc)I bought this September 3rd. Today is November 15 and it is already having me search for a replacement which makes me sad. I really loved this little vacuum! I just wish it was better made.",
