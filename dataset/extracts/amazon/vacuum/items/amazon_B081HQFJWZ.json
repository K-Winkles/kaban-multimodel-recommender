                "reviewText": "This little thing is awesome, as long as you know what you are buying! I'm pleasantly surprised at how good it works for the price and how very, very easy it is to use. It's so light I can lift it with one finger.It does not have a roller or brush nor a hose. It's basically a very nice handheld vacuum unit that also has a detachable long handle and floor attachment, plus a crevice or edge cleaning tool. It's great for hard floors and seems to work on low pile carpet or rugs. As a handheld it can be used with or without the two attachments. Another thing I like is that the floor attachment is not as wide as the ones on heavier vacuums, so it can reach narrower places my upright and robot vac can't. I find this very handy.The whole thing stands on its own but doesn't latch into the upright position. The easily released dirt cup has a filter that just lifts out so you can dump the dirt into the trash. The cord is only 15 ft. long which isn't quite long enough for my family room, which is my only little complaint. It wraps neatly on the back of the handle and the plug snaps onto the cord to hold it. Two other minor improvement suggestions would be a place on the handle to store the crevice tool, and a duster tool with bristles, but these aren't dealbreakers.It's extremely simple to put the parts together or take them apart. I immediately used it to vacuum my kitchen and family room (laminate and low pile area rug). I couldn't tell if it was picking anything up as my floor didn't appear dirty (two days since vacuuming), but when I emptied the dirt cup I could see it had done a great job especially on pet hair. It's not very loud which is nice. I believe it has about a 2 amp motor.I'd have preferred the similar $50 version that has a brush roller but chose this simpler one instead, because the one with the brush roller has reviews that say the roller doesn't actually work well.I'll continue to routinely use my beloved Wyze robot vac for my whole house, and occasionally my old Oreck upright if needed, but this little Bissell is wonderful for quick and easy cleanups or when I need a lightweight handheld vac. For hard floors it might be all you need. This little stick vac is a very good value and I recommend it for what is it. I also like that Bissell helps support homeless pets.",

                "reviewText": "This was a blind purchase, as in I did little to no research and only read a few reviews.I needed a small vacuum with enough suction power of a regular vacuum to clean my sectional rugs. This guy is it! While the suction power is great, if you have hair on your carpet that is caught in the rug fibers, the vacuum will glaze over it. You will have to pull the hair up yourself and then the vacuum will nab it. Aside from that, its great on hardwood or marble floors and gets dust up quickly. If you have a small apartment and need something powerful, light weight or easy to store, I'd say consider this vacuum! 8/10 for me, I knocked a star off just because the handle clips in and the wheel part slides in like a extender attachment so, the disassembly to use the hand held part is a bit annoying.",

Great pick up on HW and carpet, so agile and light, super easy to empty! One issue is the short, 15' cord. Way too short. I spent $7 at Lowes and bought a 7 foot, black fabric ext. cord. Works perfect and plenty of room to wind it on the handle for storage. I would give it 10 stars if I could!",

                "reviewText": "I live in a 1000 sq ft loft apartment and I wanted to get a small vacuum. I did a lot of research on vacuums, went back and forth, finally decided on this one. Mind you all of my floors are hardwood but I just wanted that extra clean satisfaction. I am OCD when it comes to cleaning and have that super clean house. Yea I have Bona swifter that can dust and mop floors which I do both but again I just wanted that extra clean factor. Once opening the box, all parts were included, instructions, and a warranty card to mail in. Super easy to put together which took less than 5 minutes. After putting it together I plug in this fabulous vacuum. It went to work immediately!!! The suction is off the charts, I believe it would suck a sock or two if it could. It really cleaned up my floors of stuff that I didn\u2019t realize was on my floors, I thought I had clean my floor immaculately. It still picked up things here and there. I included a picture of what it clean off my hardwood floors, WOW! The vacuum itself is very lightweight but packs a powerful punch when using it! The color is bright and makes a statement. It\u2019s compact for easy storage. Love this little vacuum!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!",

I got the transformer locally and the machine worked well on it. The dust in crevices was sucked up efficiently leaving surfaces clean. I could clean under the bed too, without too much trouble. It has fulfilled all the promises in the other foreign reviews.",

Tengo una grande profesional pero terminaba con dolor de espalda, pero esta aspiradora es tan ligera que no sientes el trabajo y tiene una gran potencia para su peso. Se limpia muy f\u00e1cil el dep\u00f3sito de basura y sin dudarlo lo volver\u00eda a comprar. Yo quer\u00eda algo que limpiara bien sin que terminara muerta de dolor de espalda y es justo lo que consegu\u00ed !!",
