                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect little machine - know your needs",
                "reviewText": "My needs - I have a house with laminate flooring and large and small rugs, wool and synthetic, carpeted stairs, and upstairs is entirely carpet. (I haven't tried cleaning the car yet, no doubt that's going to be a success.)First off, this machine has outstanding suction. I've had it one week and there's a lever on the top you can push to allow air flow for vacuuming back and forth or just single flow for straight suction and it get the job done. There is so much suction created around it that it's even coated in wool rug fibers or dog hair that didn't make it inside. I don't even need to go back twice, the suction is so good.Be prepared, it feels incredibly lightweight, maybe even cheap. I thought, how can this thing be well made? But it does everything I need it to do. The lightweight factor is wonderful when vacuuming each carpeted stair and dragging it up and down the stairs. So, this is actually a huge plus. There are 2 pipes that you connect for length when vacuuming the floor. On the stairs I take one pipe out and the length is perfect.The head is wide enough that it's effective for vacuuming (again, one stroke works for my short length rugs), but it's flat enough that it fits under everything - low chairs, couches, etc. If I push the lever on the head down flat, I can't draw it back and forth easily (the suction is too strong), but it's flat, so I can push it waaay back under the couches and get that dust that is so hard to reach without moving the couches. This is a big plus for me.The pipes all connect by friction, just pushing them together. Sometimes they pop off if you catch something and pull too hard, but my last ($450) vacuum (which was heavier but I loved) broke beyond repair when the connector to the head snapped where there was a locking mechanism, and that part is now discontinued. So frustrating!! So, this little vacuum seems like it will be less likely to \"snap\" anywhere because the parts will disconnect under pressure. I hope that turns out to be the case.My son assembled the unit and I used it right away. Forgot to add a bag and I was very upset - but the bag is inside already! Well done, Eureka!!The cons to this machine, as far as I can tell after multiple uses in the first week, are that there is no automatic cord winding mechanism. But, the cord is longer than my last machine - if I plug it in the middle of the house, it reaches the ends of both sides of the house. Obviously this depends on your home, but my other vacuum was just a few feet short. I can then also vaccum the entire stairs and then move the cord 1 time to get the entire house. I don't like winding the cord, so in a pile it goes if I'm lazy. Worth it for not having to move that cord!!This is not a self propelled machine. You must push the vacuum, it does not \"propel\" itself with a turning brush. There is a brush, but it's not motorized. I am a reasonably strong 40+ woman and I am happy to push it, but if you have medical issues and can't push it, this could be a more physical job. I expect vacuuming to be work, so I'm fine with this and feel the low cost is worth it. I believe it also is related to the reduced weight of the machine and its tools.I hope this review is thorough and helpful for those making a decision. I never purchase warranties, but given the lightweight nature of this machine, I think I would have considered it. I paid $81 for this machine after taxes. I would definitely be described as frugal and cost conscious. Considering the varied reviews and high cost of other well rated machines, I am very happy with my purchase! I don't write reviews very often, but I want other consumers to know the pros and cons so they can make an educated decision.",

                "reviewText": "This vacuum is great! I have long hair and just got tired of cleaning beater bars. This has an indoor-outdoor like floor attachment. Grabs hair and everything else. So easy to put together. Literally 2 minutes. Just attach the hose to the canister and add the wands. No tools necessary. Sucks like a pro. I've used it so far on hardwood, tile, and rugs. Grabs everything; for the rugs I just turn the attached ring to lessen the suction so the rug stays on the floor. Love the bag option. I have arthritis and the cannister on my regular vacuum is too hard for me to remove, empty, and replace. This comes with one bag installed and 1 extra. The opening for the bag is easy to work. The bag has a flap that is used to keep the dust in the bag when you go to throw it out. No dust flying everywhere. The cord is long enough to run through about 20 feet before needing to be moved. Cord storage is on the bottom of the unit. Wand length is good, it reached my ceiling. The little unit on wheels just rolls along behind me. Doesn't hang up when I switch from one surface to another. Love this!",

                "reviewText": "I'd buy this canister vacuum again. The suction and ease of handling are very, very good. It's light weight, so not tiring to use...a big plus. Whether a whole house job or quick spot clean, it does the job well. Over the years I've used expensive and moderately price canister vacuums, and like this the best. FYI The crevice tool does not stay in place on the machine, so I simply carry it in my back pocket. The combined small brush and upholstery attachment stored on the tank are ok for small areas. However, I use more standard size attachments from a previous vacuum if I want to cover a larger area. A nice feature is that standard wands and attachments fit this machine, so you can have more tools to use, whether it's adding wands to reach higher areas or keeping a favorite attachment from another machine.",

                "reviewText": "I run a small cleaning company and this product is a great one!Pros:Great suction like the best I have noticed on a vacuum ever. Good motor that hasn\u2019t given out for over 2 years of everyday use. Easy to disassemble to unclog if you happen to suck up anything. Bagged vacuum so no dust fly back like traditional vacuums. Super lightweight so easy to carry all day. Can lay flat to get underneath a lot of different furniture.Cons:Cheap plastic that will break the first day if you are rough with it in any way. Cheap parts that come with it but I ungraded to metal extenders and a more heavy duty floor head and that made a world of difference. Bags are small so have to change maybe 1 a week for cleaning everyday multiple houses a day. The cord is a hassle sometimes and can easily snap the metal prongs if not used gently.Great brand and will continue to use these until the cons out weigh the pros!",

Between pets and three long-haired daughters, and myself, many a vacuum has bit the dust. I've been wanting something light, easy to manage, and mess-free when it comes to emptying it. This fits the bill on all counts. I ordered it the same day I saw the post, got it the next day, and quickly embarked on a euphoric cleaning session. I am kind of in love with it. The adjustable suction is one of the coolest features and I used it multiple times. I am actually excited to vacuum now, and will likely do so almost daily with this perfect and mighty vacuum. I think it's going to gain popularity quickly now that there is a viral post about it, so grab yours now while the price is right!",
