It stands up on its own, it looks super futuristic, and thank God it tells you how much battery life you have left. I also really like that the head swivels side to side, it makes it really easy to clean stairs. It\u2019s really high-quality, easy to clean, and the highest setting has a really powerful suction. One of my favorite parts about it is that you don\u2019t have to keep your finger on the trigger. You just tap the trigger once and it stays on until you turn it off. Can\u2019t go wrong!

I reached out to the company expecting to get info for where to purchase a new batter and they did me one better. They advised me to purchase a newer model and REFUNDED ME for my previous purchase! It was above and beyond anything I expected when I reached out.The vacuum itself works well. I like that it has 3 settings and digitally tells me how much I have left in the charge. The 3rd setting works wonders on my thicker carpet and the first is great for my hardwood floors. I had to empty it multiple times when I vacuumed because it picked up a good amount of stuff off of my floor.",
