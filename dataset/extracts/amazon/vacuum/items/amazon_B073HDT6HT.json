                "reviewText": "I have the consumer/residential version of this cleaner that I have used for over a decade. It still works okay, but is getting worn. I've replaced the brush roller once and the drive belt a couple of times. I wanted a fresh replacement. Bissell no longer makes my old model, but this commercial version fit the bill. It's designed similarly with an easy to use, and clean bagless container and filter system. I can use my spare belts on this one. It doesn't have as many attachments as the consumer version, but some are still usable on this one, so I transferred some over. I have mixed thoughts on the power cord. The cord is a heavy duty commercial style cord that is longer than the consumer version. It is also removable. But it is bulkier and not as flexible as the slimmer ribbed style cord of the consumer unit. The cleaner works a little better and is quieter than my old unit. Although rated as a commercial unit, it seems lighter than my old one. It has proven itself so far and I hope it lasts for more than two decades. My old one is still in service in my second house. Recommended if you want a basic, good performing vacuum cleaner.",

                "reviewText": "So the Bissell Vacuum has always had a big name for themselves and as a fulltime cleaner and owner of a cleaning company I get tired of buying bags after bags after bags. I was happy to see this was bagless and purchased 3 of them. Great suction power, easy to use, and very lite weight. However the reason I am giving this one a 4 star is because the best thing about it is the suction its actually amazing so amazing that it will get dirty and clog up pretty quickly. The filters have to be taken out just about every other job and cleaned. If you don't mind wiping it out and shaking the filters then this is a very good vacuum for you. Most vacuums require cleaning but this one will pick up every single dust particle possible (WHICH IS AMAZING) but once its filter is clogged that's it the suction is gone and it will need the canister to be taken apart and cleaned and my only issue here is as a cleaning company you will have to take time out and clean these in between uses vs a bag vacuum there is no clog and no filters except the heppa filter which I've never had to stop vacuuming and clean it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a small business owner and I vacuum nightly. I have Bissell stick vacuums at home that I love for small messes and expected to be just as happy with their commercial product. It has a lot of appealing features: it's designed so you can easily replace the cord, and the onboard tools are useful, and it actually is lightweight for a commercial vacuum.I've been using it for less than a month, and it started out meh and has gotten significantly worse. It's just not powerful enough for commercial use. I've previously used an Oreck and a Hoover and this is significantly less effective than either of them at getting commercial carpeting clean. I find myself using the crevice tool to pick up dirt in the middle of the carpet that the roller brush should get. It has a washable filter, and of course that may be limiting the suction, but I really shouldn't have to wash it this soon: I didn't have this much reduction in performance this quickly with any of my previous machines.It also blows a really strong stream of air out in front of its path, which blows cards and stickers off of spin racks every time I go past them.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this model because it is exactly the same as my home version one. I originally bought the home version for real estate cleaning and it was $40 at Walmart. I had other vacuum cleaners for my house but ended up using this one when they died and I have used it for at least 10 years I can't even remember now exactly how long. It always has had terrific suction. My old one still works but some plastic broke off underneath. It could even be fixed maybe because it is still working otherwise. My problem with the newer vacuums that have the removable push button dumping canister is that eventually they blow dust around (at least what I've experienced) because they don't have anything to lock the suction part in place like these do. The canister may lock but not the part where the dirt flows into the canister from the vacuum. Once that fails or is loose, dust flies around sometimes more than it gets sucked up. I believe it means something that the old home model is just like the Bissell commercial model today. I agree with the other reviewer about the electric cord pigtail. It is odd but I can live with it.",

There is not much to the vacuum which makes it nice. Not much to go wrong. My only complaint is that the filters are soooo messy to clean up. There is no way to get it out without spilling it everywhere and getting it all over your hands. I\u2019ll continue using it because I haven\u2019t found anything that holds up so well.",
