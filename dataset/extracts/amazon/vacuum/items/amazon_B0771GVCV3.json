                "reviewText": "I had the same Dyson vacuum for 15 years! It had been a great vacuum but the roller stopped so I thought it is time to buy a new vacuum. Because it had been such a long time since I had purchased a vacuum I did not know where to start so I went to vacuum reviews and started reading. Because of how much I loved my first Dyson I knew I would most likely buy another one but which one should I buy was the question. Usually I think the more reviews the better so I kept going back to the Dyson ball multi floor 2 but, there were quite a few reviews I didn't like so I kept reading. I ended up choosing this vacuum because I liked the Hepa filtration system and although it doesn't have as many review it actually has a higher star rating. I hope that my review will help increase its rating because I absolutely love this vacuum and would recommend anyone buy it.So I bought the vacuum and it arrived a few days later in the mail. It was so easy to assemble, 4 clicks and your done, anyone can do it. Then I put it to the test. I vacuumed a rug in my entry way and the suction was incredible! I moved on to a lighter weight rug and had no trouble, I was expecting the rug to get sucked up in the vacuum from some reviews I had read but I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. This vacuum works so well that I filled the dust canister in my small living room twice and it is a good size canister! I couldn't believe it!I have only had this vacuum a week so if my opinion changes I will submit a new review but so far I think this may be the best vacuum I have every owned. I hope this one lasts me 15 years like my last one did, I know it's not likely but that would be awesome.Pros:Quick shippingEasy assemblyAwesome suctiongreat size dust canistergood mobilitynormal weightlong cord Cons:Nothing so far!",

                "reviewText": "This was a purchase from my mother. Its suction is great. It is heavy and maneuvering the floor part is not that easy because of its weight. It is one those that have the ball technology for movement. You need to get use to it and learn how better move it back and forth to get it move around and sides. This brand was highly recommended by my older sister because of the easy way to dispose the dirt. Just need to press two buttons. The first one to take out the compartment that gathers all the dirt out of the vacuum and the second to open the botton lead to take out the dirt into the trash. The other thing that was very important that the vacuum needed to have is a lifetime washable filter. We chose the one with the lowest price over $200, taking into account the tax and shipping to Puerto Rico. Also there were fewer choices that could arrive here. But if you live in the states you probably can find more options within this brand.It has two heads for the vacuum tube part. One of the heads function as two and can be stick to the side of the vacuum with an additional piece that was included. Easy to assemble. It took me a little bit more time to be able to understand how activate the vacuum for floors. Worth try this brand. They have other styles that are lightweight and other that have the ball that moves very easily. Great quality for the money spent.",

I\u2019ve got three huskies so the hair in my house can get ridiculous and this has done a great job at sucking it up and not getting too tangled in the roller brush. My favorite feature is that you can turn the roller on and off which I like to use when switching from my hardwoods to rugs. The only thing I miss on my Shark that this doesn\u2019t have are the lights. I never realized how much it helps until I started using a vacuum without them.",

I need for commercial property .This It Looks pretty sweet in photo'sI did a quick test - Has Good suction, will work on a short carpet. BUT So many cheap plastic parts for price of item. Hard to maneuver, short hose - very stiff hose , that falls from unit when you maneuver vacuum on carpet . Vacuum falls over, very unfriendly use when tested reaching desk or ceiling, very short reach. unfortunately will not work for myself or staff . Thankfully I was able to return, and my search continues .",
