        "description": "This certified refurbished Dyson DC41 Upright Ball Vacuum is engineered for outstanding cleaning performance and ease of use. It has the strongest suction at the cleaner head, which automatically self-adjusts for different carpet lengths and hard floors. The DC41 features Dyson\u2019s latest Radial Root Cyclone technology, Ball technology for smooth steering, and a large 0.55-gallon bin. Ball technology for upright vacuums Dyson Ball upright vacuums ride on a ball, which pivots on the spot so you can steer with a turn of the wrist. The ball also houses core technology, including the motor and ducting. There\u2019s less clutter, so it\u2019s easier to clean in awkward places, along edges, and around furniture. Strongest suction at the cleaner head Many upright vacuums use fixed settings, and their cleaner heads don\u2019t self-adjust to different floor types. The bigger the gap between cleaner head and floor, the more suction power is wasted. With the DC41, an active base plate creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining more suction power. It\u2019s designed for outstanding performance across all floors--not just carpets. Powerful and durable The DC41 is constructed from materials selected for strength, flexibility, and tolerance. Many parts are made from polypropylene reinforced with 20 percent glass fibers and high-impact PC-ABS. Using these materials means greater strength from less plastic, so the machine is lightweight. Motorized brush bar Stiff nylon bristles spin at up to 90 times per second to agitate carpet pile and dislodge ground-in dirt and pet hair, and the brush bar can be turned off to protect delicate rugs and hard floors. Captures allergens and expels cleaner air Unlike ordinary vacuums that can\u2019t always retain all the dust they remove, venting some of it back into your room in the air they expel, the DC41 captures and contains microscopic particles such as pollen, mold and bacteria.Hygienic and quick to emptyEmptying the bin on a Dyson vacuum is quick and hygienic. The bin is clear, so you can see when it needs emptying and how much dust, dirt, and pet hair the machine has captured. Just press the release button to empty the bin.",

I was hesitant at first about the factory reconditioned aspect of this, but the Prime DOTD was too good an offer to not try out. I have had the vacuum for months and it has not let me down yet. Very powerful, but quiet. The filters do need cleaned every three months or so. The cord is very long, one plug covers my entire apartment and it even works great on my tiled floor area. A great vacuum at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't bought a refurbished appliance or electronic device before. I've always bought new, fearing that the item would lack the look and quality I want. However, I read that this Dyson vac was certified by the company, so given the price and need for a new one, I took a chance. This is my first Dyson vac, and I was eager to see if it indeed lived up to the hype. I've been disappointed with my last couple of vacs that didn't perform well for very long. Being a clean freak with two cats and a dog, my vacs get used a LOT. I could have bought a Dyson with the two others I've ditched in the last couple of years.The Dyson arrived in beautiful condition, looking like new out of the box. It was easy to assemble and I had to test it out immediately. Look! Cat hair! First impression: this is one quiet vac! The decible level was well below the jet-engine hum of its predecessor. Then I noticed I didn't so much have to pull and push. This ingeniously designed appliance only required gentle guidance. Nice. So nice that I did the entire house in the first test. It was almost (almost) pleasurable. But the real test is how did it handle the animal fur in that little wind tunnel? Like the champ it is!!! I'm a Dyson convert and when and if this baby gives out, I'll buy another one.",

                "reviewText": "I had been trying to decide between a Dyson and the much-advertised Shark version. Boy, am I glad I decided to spring for the Dyson!I managed to snap this re-manufactured unit up from Amazon/Woot and it may be the best deal I got all year! True, I had to spring for the optional tangle-free upholstery head (WELL worth the money, btw), but this thing is amazing!I keep dogs in the house and the only room with carpet is the den. So before the Dyson arrived, I made sure that I cleaned the house and vacuumed everything the day before. As soon as I put the Dyson together, I immediately re-vacuumed the den. To my amazement, the Dyson picked up enough hair to nearly fill the bin!The power is so strong that it actually dwarfs the power of my 4.5 hp Shop Vac! And when you live with multiple dogs, it's nice to have a unit that's powerful enough to pick up every strand of hair on hardwood floors, even if the head is several inches away! For carpets, it's the best unit I've ever seen and I love not having to manually adjust the head every time I switch from carpet to hardwood.While I'd like to have attachments easily available on the unit itself (Shark seems to have this advantage), I'm pretty sure I can leave without that feature.Oh - and did I fail to mention that the power cord is long enough to where I can plug it into the main hall and not have to move it while I vacuum the whole house? Another time-saver!",
