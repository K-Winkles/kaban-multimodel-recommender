If the indicator light of battery lit up in a grid cycle, it means the battery is normal. The new battery has a false charge in its initial state, we recommend fully charging the battery for at least 5 hours before first use. Why does the vacuum cleaner stop after running on the carpet for a while? This vacuum cleaner is only suitable for short-pile carpets. It will stop the main unit automatically when using on long-pile carpets or there are too many tangled hairs on brush. Then we need to clean the floor brush first to restore the main unit. Why does the battery runtime not match the description? The new battery has a false charge in its initial state, and usually has to complete two or three cycles of full charge and total depletion to achieve a learning match with the main machine unit and to get the optimal working hours. How often do I need to change my filter? White HEPA filter and black sponge can be washed and reused. They are usually suggested to be changed once every three months, in addition to the body comes with a set of HEPA filter and sponge, we have an extra set for replacement.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I own 2 robot cleaners in the home that run twice a week, along with one wired vacuum cleaner for special needs. However, cordless is something I always need for the convenience of quick cleaning when needed in the home. Obviously, Dyson was on our list but tried this and overall I am satisfied with it. Details in cons but still I would rate this with 5 stars just because of the value it delivers for this price. Very reasonably priced and that is the key feature.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Works great for light jobs but I can't think of using this for complete home cleaning. It is meant for spot cleaning only- It is very lightweight and anyone in the home can use it with ease- The dirt filtration system is decent but definitely doesn't compare with Dyson in any case- Multiple suction modes for various needs and it is easy to operate with just a push of a button- Super reasonably priced and delivers a lot of value- Cordless and hence makes it so convenient to clean nooks and corners- Handle has a swivel movement feature in all four directions & also it is retractable to suit various needs- Comes with a few attachments to use for different needs of cleaning- It is easy to use and also cleans the dirt bin. Handles are ergonomically designed and don't trigger pain on long use- Comes as a complete package with everything includedCons:- Not the suction power you would get in wired cleaners- I wish they included an extra replaceable battery in the set",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This vacuum is super light! I was surprised at how easy it was to use around the house, especially compared to my old upright. It reached under furniture and into corners with ease.Cordless and convenient no cord all around the house limited to just how far the outlet reaches. I zoomed from room to room with newfound cleaning freedom.Having two suction modes was handy. I used the max power for deep cleaning carpets and the standard mode for everyday hard floors.The 180W motor is very powerful, is also quiet even on max mode. The 45-minute runtime (on standard mode) was accurate and enough for a quick clean of the whole house, love the LED headlights lit up dust bunnies and crumbs hiding in dark corners, making sure I didn't miss anything.The dustbin empties with a simple click, and the filters are washable, which saves on buying replacements.The detachable attachments were great for reaching tight spaces like crevices in furniture and corners. I even used the crevice tool to clean out the car.Overall, lightweight, powerful, and convenient, making cleaning a breeze. The battery life is good. If you're looking for a cordless vacuum that's great for hard floors, low-pile carpets, and pet hair, I highly recommend checking this one out!",
