From canister to bagged and bagless uprights to stick (battery and corded) to shop vacs, including four different Shark models. NONE of them were as powerful as this Shark. I\u2019m not surprised because the reviews and ratings (Consumer Reports, YouTube, etc.) led me down this path. This vacuum has incredible suction, very effective rollers, is very air tight (little to no dust escapes), has effective settings for hard floors/thick carpets/low pile carpets), can be configured as an upright or hand-held, it\u2019s easy to empty, it has a long power cord, and is priced fairly for how good this vacuum is.For me, the only cons are: It\u2019s large and heavy, the wand doesn\u2019t expand and it doesn\u2019t come with all of the available attachments.In sum, this is an exceptional vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "Not all Sharks are created equal! Our previous Shark was a midrange Lift-Away model that replaced a first-generation Dyson. Want to say we spent $160+. It was a fine model that was slightly better than the outgoing Dyson, but it left a lot to be desired. The cable was short and attached to the base in a horrible spot (where it was likely to get stepped on or tripped over). It also wasn't a powered Lift-Away, and the short hose would easily tip over the base when stretched a short distance. Handed it down to a college kid after 5 years and decided it was time to splurge on something better.Enter the Shark Vertex. Not too expensive but far from cheap, the Vertex sits on the high-end of the Shark lineup with all the bells & whistles. Comes with a 30ft cord (5 ft longer than the average) seated in a much more useful position, powered Lift-Away, stretchier hose, the newer tangle-resistant dual roller, and....best of all....immense suction power!The first pic shows it freshly unboxed. The second pic shows the carnage it pulled from our carpet, one day after our housecleaner was here (she uses a midrange Shark stick vacuum that is still fairly new). No joke, this baby doesn't mess around! We do have a thick-coated dog that sheds pretty often, but no doubt most of what's pictured here was missed by the other Shark. We could drop the mic and stop here, but the other perks are worth mentioning.You don't really appreciate what it means to have 5 extra feet of cord until you have it! Then there's the newer roller design that doesn't tangle. If you deal with pet hair like I do, this is a must-have feature. No need to keep that nasty set of scissors around for clearing out the rollers. Go ahead and toss them for good! And if you are a current Shark owner without \"powered\" Lift-Away, you'll appreciate being able to get under low-height furniture like coffee tables and entertainment centers without having to break out the hose attachment. Just engage the Lift-Away feature and the main vacuum head stays running with the ability to glide underneath. Simple and effective!Speaking of simple, the power button is now at your fingertips on the handle, with different settings for floor height. The dual-roller design uses a soft padded roller that easily collects hair, dirt, and cheerio-sized bits from tile and hardwood floors, including the little grout crevices between tiles. The front facing LEDs are a nice touch as well and fairly bright.As for the cons, there aren't many, but there are a few minor gripes...1. When you adjust to the lowest floor setting with the least suction power, small rugs still have a tendency to lift up and get snagged, tripping the red light and stopping the rollers. Doesn't happen too often, and when it does, just cycle the power off/on from the handle and keep going.2. The collection bin is somewhat on the smaller side compared to my last Shark, but on the flipside, it does seem to empty better. It could also be that it fills faster because of how much it is actually collecting!3. While powered Lift-Away is helpful at times, it can become a little tedious for long periods of use. The speed of the rollers causes the vacuum head to pull away from you. So when you pull the head back toward you, there's a good deal of resistance.4. While the hose is longer and stretchier than the mid-range model I owned before, it could still be a bit longer. Very, very minor gripe here.Overall, extremely happy with the purchase! The newer model, the Shark Stratos, is basically the same vacuum with a slightly cheaper frame and hose, although it does add an \"odor neutralizer\" feature (uses a cartridge that has to be replaced every 3 months or so, which seems gimmicky to me). Personally, I'd get the Vertex unless the Stratus is marked way down. Cheers!",

Great for pet hair and everything else that litters a floor carpet or hard. Self cleaning roller of long strand debris hair threads etc is great ,roller needs no haircut to clean .my only complaint is Shark took the light off of the handle .GONE! If anyone enjoyed the convenience of this feature on other models from shark you need to decide if you want a vacuum without it . I replaced my XL after I wore out the floor rollers, they stopped turning, I still have the lift-away with the lighted handle which is great for the car and tight spots with no light. Shark may hopefully offer an upgraded hose handle control component with a light, wishful thinking but these vacuums are powerful and the most thought out user friendly I have owned, even without the light I am happy with it , would recommend it , especially if pet hair is a way of life that you want to keep under real control , ps motorized pet brush is amazing!",

I have owned at least seven different vacs over the past 40 years always living with multiple dogs.This vac has outperformed all the vacuums that I have used. It is so well engineered and thoughtfully put together. The suction is incredible the rollers never get bunged up or clogged with hair. The ease of removing the main body from the business end of the vac allows for easy access to under furniture or use on stairs, not to mention the extra reach from the power plug that is obtained at least 5more feet.Clean out is a breeze with the trap door on the bin and the additional top door opening.It is such a good vacuum that I purchased one as a bonus for my G.M. when she mentioned she was looking for a vacuum. Although the cost is more than a lot of vacs but not as munch as the cordless hyped alternatives under the \"D****\" brand.Buy this vac you will not regret it.",
