No one knows what to expect of this new race of aliens. In no time, Jack's life becomes a nightmare. Some crazy people decide the aliens are going to destroy Earth. Jack and his new friend Rex walk into a situation they never expected. Can they survive. I love this alternate look at the end of the Earth. It's original and unique. Well written and characters you can relate to make this book even better. You will be surprised at the direction this book takes. This is one to add to your library. It's perfect for book clubs too. I found no issues. I gave this one 5 cheers out of 5 because it's a fantastic read. ~Copy of book provided by author in exchange for a fair review~",

What happens when they knock, and we open the door? Are they monsters? Are we?Brown answers these questions by taking the reader on a rocket-powered joyride through fantastical milieus and the most human of hardships. Narrating this story is Jack Bennett, a well-developed character whose journey spans the soul as well as space and time. Joining Bennett is his alien companion, Rex, whose people differ wildly from, yet are also touchingly similar to, our own.Without giving anything away: The plot of 'Vacuum' is very well thought out, with excellent foreshadowing and plenty of surprises. Its ending will have you on the edge of your seat.\"What's that old philosophical question? If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Other than me, no one heard humanity fall.\"-- Jack Bennett, from Ben Brown's 'Vacuum'*Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this eBook from the author in exchange for an honest review.",

I figured though that authors want the truth in the reviews not false platitudes so here is my honest review......This book was AMAZING! It shows the human spirit in a whole new way, how would any of us cope if we were the last human alive? I think Ben captured all the emotions in Jack that any of us would go through. I found myself believing I was reading the journals of a doomed man.How Jack came to be where he was, the relationships with family and in particular with Rex sent me on a roller coaster of emotions.I found it hard to put this book down once I'd started and had to force myself to leave some for next day when the clock hit 5am!I highly recommend this book to one and all.",

How he evolved, adapted to and persevered through some very unusual and difficult circumstances, also his inseparable bond of love and friendship with an alien.

I didn't feel sympathy for the main character to begin with. Jack Bennett had money and power, a beautiful wife, and a lovely family. At the start of the story I expected him to be some heartless, corrupt being,but this soon changed. A victim of circumstance, you find yourself cheering him on and you understand his motivations and intentions. The science, the human spirit, the expectations we hold ourselves to, and the darker side of ignorace, Mr Brown does not falter. Well done.",
