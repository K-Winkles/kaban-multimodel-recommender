                "reviewText": "This vacuum is FANTASTIC! I did a ton of research before purchasing, and upon use it exceeds my expectations. Here was my list of WANTS: Large dust can, lightweight, maneuverable, long cord, great SUCTION for pet hair, easy to use attachments, on-board attachments, able to turn the roller on/off, pet attachment with roller brush, quiet, good brand. This is ALL that and more! As a bonus, it swivels, the narrower vacuum makes getting under chairs and furniture so easy, the attachments attach to the wand AND directly to the hose, and the dust can lifts off for ease up/down the stairs. I could not be happier. I bought this for my elderly mom who has a golden retriever and fur everywhere. I had been vacuuming her house with my older Dyson, which I keep in tip-top condition with clean brush roller and components. But I wanted to get her a vacuum so I didn't have to lug over my Dyson. I was S H O C K E D and horrified to see how much fur the Dyson was NOT getting out of the carpet! I did side by side comparisons and it was truly horrifying how much the Dyson left. This Kenmore is the BOMB! There was ZERO fur or dust left in the carpet after vacuuming with this Kenmore. It was SO much quieter, lighter, more maneuverable, and the attachments are so much easier to use than the Dyson which have always been tricky. I promptly bought a second identical Kenmore for myself and donated my older Dyson. My only comment is that the instructions on how to attach the attachments directly to the hose could have been better. So using them on the wand is intuitive. But I couldn't figure out how to get them on the hose - so if it helps others, there is a hose release up at the top by the handle, and they attach right in front of the handle. Also, the Pet roller brush is soooooo good on upholstery. I absolutely love this thing.",

                "reviewText": "Bought allot of vacuums in my life. Everything you worry about with a vacuum is solved in this one. It does all the tricks and then some. If you watch the videos on this one you'll see just how vast the array mechanisms on this Kenmore really are.Favorite features, self propel. Yeah, just like the lawn mowers that move forward for you, this Kenmore does the same because of the rotating bar and the suction strength. It really deep cleans. Second favorite feature is the swivel action. It can turn on a dime without allot of back and forth to get where you want. One turn of your wrist and it heads the opposite direction. The length of the hose is perfect! the ability to use the items that come with the machine, are easy to attach and use. The filter is perfect, oh and there's this incredible light that stays green to let you know about your filter. It will tell you when the filter is so full that it's slowing down the suction power. Throw the filter in the wash or hand wash, let it dry and you're back in business. With this Kenmore you've bought a machine that finally takes care of YOU. I'm done babying and working on a machine that I fight the cord, the machine, or the low suction.If you've got a non-carpeted area, you can walk right into that room with the machine on full blast, it won't shoot the particles out the back. The cord let me move into a third room and I was so happy to be done with the chore no one likes. Sweat factor 1 to 10, about a 3. Don't look any further, this is one.Tell 'em Boss sent you.",

                "reviewText": "We received our new Kenmore vacuum yesterday, 4 days earlier than expected...thank you Amazon! Upon unpackaging our first impressions were that the vacuum was what we expected. It was somewhat more difficult to get everything to \"snap\" together, but once it was together, it seems on par with other types of vacuums we have looked at. We have had 3 Dyson Animals, 1 of original (lasted 12 years) and 2 balls (each lasted 5 years).Pros:It is easy to move around...turns and goes around furniture easy. Comparable to Dyson ball vacuum.Lightweight and easy to carry around, means easier up and down stairs if your house is multi-level. My kids can easily use it.Length of cord is adequate to not have to move cord every time we move into another room.Suction seems adequate, picks up a lot of hair and dust Dyson left behind (but I believe any brand new vacuum will do this). Hopefully this will last for a while.Love the adjustable suction power on the hand wand, sometimes don't need the full power.Entire vacuum is intuitive, don't need to read a book to figure out how to use it.Love that attachments are carried on board.Canister volume seems pretty good and comparable to Dyson.Easy canister removal and dumping. Bigger area for hair to go without building up in the upper part of the canister (I always had to pull the hair out of the canister in my Dyson).Like the head light to see what is in front of the vacuum.ConsThe head is 2 inches narrower than the Dyson, means more passes to cover the room.Replacing the wand after use requires a pretty firm slam into place to get it to lock back into position.In general, decent mid-priced vacuum, we bought it expecting it to be more of a disposable piece that should last 2-3 years. Given what you pay for Dyson for 5 years of use, this is about the same price. Hopefully we will get 3 years out of it. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats which are all in and out of the house. Our house is surrounded by dirt and heavy winds, so dirt settles on the floors and is tracked in and stomped into carpets. Vacuums have to work hard around here!",

I did a lot of research reading reviews on multiple brands and styles. I decided to go with this one because the reviews were great - even the bad ones can only complain the suction is too much for their liking. In my eyes that wasn't a bad review, I think people are just improperly using their vacuum. There is even a piece that you swivel to control suction power. Not to mention this is the first vacuum to actually work on hard floor without just spinning the dirt everywhere. I am blown away after one use. The attached picture is what this picked up from my front entrance area rug. It looks like I haven't even been vacuuming that's how much stuff came out. Very pleased with this purchase and I feel the price is incredible for the power you get. There are reviews stating its hard to maneuver and I'm unsure why they felt this way as I find it glides with such ease and moves very smoothly. If anything changes with more use I will be sure to update my review. For now though, extremely blown away!",
