                "reviewText": "I love this stick vacuum! Thses are the reasons:Very good value for the money.For a small stick Vac it has incredible cleaning power, it truly picked up much of the dirt, dust that is ground into this carpet.Very Light weight unit, easy to use and get into tight or difficult areas where you may not be able to moveheavier furniture by yourself. So it is perfect gift for perhaps older or senior or people with health issues who can not use a heavier vacuum. As well as College Students who are always on the go or committed to their studies and have little time to spare. since it makes cleaning easier and will give students an incentive to NOT neglect their living areas and take 10- 15 mins just to tidy up on a daily basis.Easy clean up and maintenance! The dirt container easily detaches from the mounting clips so you may access the small HEPA filter and dump all the Dirt ad Debris into the garbage.Easy storage with the wall mount. It takes up very little space when you need to store it while not in use!Great Vacuum, beautiful product! Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised about how small the box was and how light and tiny this vacuum is! It is also at least half as loud as my full size upright unit. I bought this vacuum specifically for my laminate kitchen floor. I have 2 furry dogs and I wanted to pick up hair, dirt, and leaves that are stuck to their fur that mostly land on my kitchen floor when they come in from the yard. Just tried it out for the first time and it did an awesome job!Easy to take apart/empty and I used the hand held to get dog hair off my couch. I feel like this is a perfect vac for small jobs when you don't want to get the regular vac out.Absolutely prefer this over a broom when I just want to \"\"sweep\"\" up the kitchen floor.I can even now vacuum my bathroom, which is too small for the bulky upright and is not a good fit for my Rumba. I love the robot vac, but it's obnoxiously loud, and it does require neat floors, which is not always the case for me. So, with this new thing, I can quickly do a touch-up, and be done with it!I also own a pricy handheld Dyson, but got too tired of bending down for a more thorough floor coverage, and don't want to pay for expensive attachments.This is definitely one of the best things for home this price can get you these days! Thank you!",

I was looking for a more economical option than a Dyson and I am very pleased with this purchase!We have a cat and the floor was always dirty with cat hair, cat litter, etc. This vacuum is a lifesaver!It\u2019s exactly what we needed, som ething flexible, easy to use, and no annoying cords when your trying to get around corners. I can vacuum daily without it being a hassle and the brush attachment is also great for keeping our couch clean!I have had it for about a month now and it works very well. The battery life is good. I am able to vacuum my entire apartment before the battery dies with juice to spare. The vacuum is easy to clean which is great for homes with women with long hair. It\u2019s also a very beautiful product and easy to use.Overall this vacuum is the perfect fit for someone on a budget who wants to keep their house clean, especially with pets!",

This has been a welcome change from the clunky vacuums we've had in the past or the compact ones that don't even work.The assembly of the vacuum was pretty easy just pay attention to which button detaches which part or you may accidentally create a dust pile.It's fairly lightweight which makes it easy to m ove around the home as the whole vacuum or just the handheld piece.It\u2019s a very strong vacuum, it has high and low speeds.It also charges up pretty quickly which is a welcome bonus. One charge is enough to clean my whole apartment.It has a convenient light when vacuuming so you can see what exactly is picked up/ still needs to be picked up.Love that it comes with a wall mount as well to give it its own little area.I really enjoy this vacuum and a cheaper alternative to oth er more expensive vacuums. I no longer need to sweep my floors!Overall fantastic product, especially for the price.",

The company reached out to me and their attempt to make it right was honorable. They indicated the vac might have been malfunctioned or had an issue with the operation and they sent me an entirely new one. The new vac appears to working fine at this point, so I am now satisfied with the product and would recommend it to others. Thank you Voweek customer service for making this right :)",
