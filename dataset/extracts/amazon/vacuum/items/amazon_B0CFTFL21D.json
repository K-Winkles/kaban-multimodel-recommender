It is lightweight and easy to maneuver around spaces. I also like the availability of various nozzles that came with it. Overall, this is a great buy!",

I\u2019ve had it for 2 weeks now and haven\u2019t needed to charge it again. Definitely worth the price, that\u2019s for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new vacuum because the last time i bought one was in college. I have been using it for 3 days and:1. The assembly was easy to use, I was able to assemble it within 3 minutes.2. The suction is horrible, even on the highest settings. I wasn\u2019t even able to suck up a small fry. Even if I put it into the tube.3. The way this is built, it only works on small crumbs and even then I had to pass by 3 or 4 times to get everything. It\u2019s flat to the surface.4. The kick back, once the vacuum is turned off some debris will fall back down. So make sure to have a broom.5. It was supper light weight & easy to clean.6. For the price it was great, probably will have to buy another vacuum in 1-2 years or less.",
