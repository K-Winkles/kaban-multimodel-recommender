(It does not have rollers on the main vacuum attachment it's like a little rubbery strip that works great for pushing things forward! Awesome purchase for price and what I was looking for! I was tiered of lugging my big vacuum up and down floors, same for my income vacuum system (honestly though I think this little vacuum works better then my in home vacuum system anyways)",

It has great suction and it\u2019s easy to manipulate going around corners, etc. The only drawback is that Hepa filter has to be cleaned often as I have carpeting. I use a toothbrush to clean the hair in dust a few times as I\u2019m using it and then I wash it from time to time. I will get one or two replacement filters when I can find them. However, it\u2019s perfect for me because I can\u2019t use a heavy vacuum. I definitely recommend it for my one bedroom apartment or for quick pick ups in a large house.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for a few reasons:Easy to assemble, very lightweight, easy maneuverability, plug in so no waiting for charging, no brush roll so hair doesn't get tangled in it, dust cup and filter, multiple options for cleaning (dust buster etc), and of course the cheap price.How it ended up:It's a stick vaccuum so it's not for anything that requires strong suction such as thick carpeting which I unfortunately have. I think it's just barely too thick ugh. So when I use it, I have to really lean into it to make it suction better (I hope I achieve this anyway, otherwise I'm killing my back for nothing lol).The cord is very short lol. I can not reach the other ends of the bdrm or living room using the the same outlets in each room. I use a bdrm outlet for the bdrm and I have to plug it into another bdrm outlet for the rest of the bdrm, kind of a hassle! The bdrm is a bit long but geez it's not a mansion lol. It's a very basic 1 bdrm apt!The size is very small and easy to assemble, when I first opened the box, I was shocked how small the box was lol. Unfortunately mine doesn't stay upright on its own, so you do have to always have it leaning on something. To empty the dust cup, you basically have to disassemble part of it and then reassemble. That's annoying. And there isn't anything to attach the extra tool to on the vaccuum so it just sits freely near it lol.I could go on lol. Maybe I should have returned it but oh well. I didn't want to deal with that during the pandemic. It could be ideal for you if your home situation is different and better for it than mine is. I should have listened to warnings.",

                "reviewText": "At first I thought \u201cOh, I see. I\u2019ve purchased the worst vacuum in the history of ever.\u201dWe have dogs and cats and a lot of hardwood floors, so we end up with tumbleweeds everywhere. I bought this as a quick cleanup tool that I could easily carry up and downstairs.But when I first turned it on, I realized that it has a basic design flaw: the vents blow air SIDEways, rather than straight back, so the second I started cleaning, the tumbleweeds went flying AWAY from the vacuum. Which is sort of the opposite of what you want.Then I remembered a hack I\u2019d seen on another hand vac with the same problem, tried it... and all is forgiven! Best little vac ever.Here\u2019s my version of the solution, using paper painter\u2019s tape (it\u2019s usually bright blue \u2014 no clue why this one is green.) Wide masking tape would do as well. Fold a strip of tape in half with the sticky sides together. Then use another strip of tape to attach the first strip just below the vents. Voila! Even that short a spoiler works to redirect the air flow, and we\u2019re in business.Solid motor, great suction, the free-standing feature is handier than you might think, the swivel head works really well, and this has a cord, so you\u2019re not at the mercy of recharging. If you\u2019ve got lots of pet hair around, you\u2019ll find that the bin needs emptying pretty frequently. I have a feeling I\u2019ll need to replace the filter pretty soon, but I can baby it a while by washing it out. All in all, a great product \u2014 once you retrofit the spoilers.",

Very disappointing, as this is a great brand, and I had the cordless one before this one. Needed one that lasted longer while vacuuming.",

                "reviewText": "Estoy contenta con la aspiradora porque es muy buena levantando polvo, pelos y cabellos del suelo, m\u00e1s no para levantar pedacitos de papel, cart\u00f3n, plantas o cualquier basura de aproximadamente un cent\u00edmetro porque se queda atorada en una compuerta pl\u00e1stica dise\u00f1ada para que la basura no se regrese. NO aspiren Unicel porque se atora en el filtro y es dif\u00edcil de quitar. En la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico siempre hay mucho polvo, as\u00ed que con tantito que aspire se ensucia mucho el filtro, y para no forzar la m\u00e1quina lo limpio frecuentemente as\u00ed que nunca he estado cerca de llenar el gran dep\u00f3sito para basura que tiene.Algo que me hab\u00eda llamado mucho la atenci\u00f3n de este modelo es que tiene un filtro lavable y pens\u00e9 que no necesitar\u00eda reemplazarlo, pero resulta que el fabricante sugiere hacer el cambio cada 6 \u00f3 9 meses y no he encontrado d\u00f3nde conseguirlos. Adjunto fotos del filtro por si eso ayuda a alguien a encontrar un reemplazo de otra marca. Me gust\u00f3 que es muy liviana (aprox 1.6 kilos con la barra met\u00e1lica y el accesorio grande) y porque es f\u00e1cil de sacudir el filtro aunque es un poco ruidosa como cualquier otra de este tama\u00f1o por lo que sugiero usar protecci\u00f3n auditiva y usarla lejos de las mascotas . Ellos sugieren que se use el cepillo accesorio, pero lo desaconsejo porque se le queda atrapada la basura en sus cerdas y mejor sugiero usar un cepillo dental de cerdas suaves.Originalmente la compr\u00e9 para recoger los pelos de gato de los muebles, pero no la uso para eso porque el cepillo se ensucia mucho y hay que pasarla varias veces para que levante todo el pelo. Para recoger el pelo recomiendo totalmente este rodillo https://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/aw/d/B087WWQXQR?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title que es s\u00faper eficiente levanta\u00e1ndolo.El accesorio de pl\u00e1stico que es como una extensi\u00f3n es bueno para la limpieza de ventanas, pero result\u00f3 muy in\u00fatil para limpiar entre los asientos del coche o entre muebles porque es demasiado corto y termina chocando el cuerpo de la aspiradora.Luego de aproximaba un a\u00f1o de uso ocasional de rompieron unas pesta\u00f1as del accesorio para aspirar el piso. La funci\u00f3n de dichas pesta\u00f1as era permitir que el cabezal girara libremente para as\u00ed permanecer pegado al piso al aspirar bajo los muebles. Sin las pesta\u00f1as el accesorio no se detiene y se cae al piso. Lo solucion\u00e9 enredando cinta tefl\u00f3n (la que se usa para la cuerda de piezas de tuber\u00eda de agua) en la pieza que perdi\u00f3 las pesta\u00f1as y con eso ya no se cae el cabezal y puedo aspirar normalmenteHecha en ChinaConsumo el\u00e9ctrico 4A (480W)Voltaje AC 120V",
