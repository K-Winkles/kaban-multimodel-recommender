                "reviewText": "Got this vacuum and was thrilled by its light weight and suction power, BUT then the problems started shortly after 4 or 5 uses. The power cord is so junky that the wires that run through it started fraying underneath. It was shorting as I used it. For a while as long as long as I held the cord and pinched it, it worked. But then it wouldn't even turn on. As you can in the photo, the zipper is of such poor quality that it started getting stuck and then like all cheap zippers it malfunctioned and its impossible to fix. I feel like I was robbed without a gun and I have no recourse but to throw this piece of junk away.",

The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the pig tail connection it was very bulky and it ended up wearing out and causing a short in the cord so I had that removed which made a world of difference. It does go through belts and I was surprise that the handle literally disintegrated. It also has great suction. I recommend this vacuum. Unfortunately you can\u2019t buy anything that lasts so you have to expect that when you purchase anything new today that you\u2019re going to have to repair it frequently. It\u2019s very unfortunate but true of our times.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two and first it was just one that broke right away... so I just thought it was defective and I returned/ replaced it and bought another one (3 total). Within ONE WEEK (not even exaggerating) all 3 were broken. It didn\u2019t just break, but they split in half! I didn\u2019t bother getting a replacement again because I realized it was just a poor product and I didn\u2019t want a new one to add to my vacuum cemetery. I own a school and it was just used to vacuum the classrooms nightly\u2014nothing crazy just one vacuum per room. I just can\u2019t believe how terrible they are. Note- they aren\u2019t not commercial grade and if you are doing any kind of vacuuming other than your bedroom - let\u2019s say once a week then just run. Seriously. I doubt they will give me a refund now but I figured I had to let others knows about this mess!!",
