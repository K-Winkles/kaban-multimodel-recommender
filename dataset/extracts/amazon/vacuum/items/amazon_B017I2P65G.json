                "reviewText": "Ever since I was a young kid, I\u2019ve had adversarial relationships with vacuum cleaners. At home, when mom assigned me the vacuuming chore, I remember using a Lewyt metal canister vacuum. I hated it because the nameplate made a horrific buzzing sound that I couldn't stand. I'd give it a swift kick and the buzzing would stop for a while- only to need another kick later- plus it never rolled straight. Of course that was the 1960s and vacuum cleaners have improved immensely.This Tritan by Prolux is (so far) everything I could hope for in a vacuum. It replaces a Eureka canister vacuum that we had for years that was OK, I guess. I got tired of fixing the broken hose (connection to the vacuum body) with gaffers tape, and when you pushed the cord retract button, the AC power plug would retract with so much force that it would wedge itself into the vacuum so that I needed a pair of pliers to extract it.On the Prolux Tritan, the cord retractor works smoothly and not too fast. Plus you can pull the cord out from its fully retracted position without dragging the whole vacuum across the room. I also like that the motor starts somewhat gradually. So if you accidentally left it turned on, and you plug in, it doesn't end up scaring the crap out of you. It more gradually comes up to speed. Even at the maximum setting, this vacuum is quiet (vacuuming fatigue isn\u2019t just physical). The suction is very strong and it is adjustable. You can vary the suction with the \"diverter valve\" on the hose nozzle (like most vacuums of this type) AND with the knob on the vacuum which varies motor speed. It really keeps you from accidentally sucking in lighter rugs, drapes and such.For the most part, the attachments are excellent. The bare floor brush (which has a rocker switch that either lowers or raises the brush) broke so that the brush was extended all of the time. I contacted Prolux about this and they immediately sent me a replacement floor brush attachment at no charge. Excellent customer service! The hose end and extension tubes are slightly larger in diameter than most vacuums. It just means that if you have attachments from other vacuum manufacturers, they won\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t think that matters except for the dust brush which is kind of crappy. It turns out that our old dust brush made of rubber can be shoved onto the hose end and/or extension tubes.The vacuum comes with extra bags and a hook/razor tool that allows you to easily remove hair that gets stuck in the rotary brush attachment. Oh yes, I almost forgot: I love that it has HEPA filtration. Great for asthmatics like me.You get a lot of vacuum for the $. It\u2019s a very good value considering the quality and engineering that was put into it. It seems built to withstand years of normal use, but time will tell. But for now, it\u2019s everything I would want in a vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "I took a chance on this brand that I'd never heard of, and I am so glad! It is a great little machine. It's heavy enough to be sturdy and durable but light enough to be easily maneuvered, even in tight spots. Suction is fantastic! It does a good job on hardwood floors as well as carpeting and upholstery, even taking up matted cat hair. The cord retracts easily and completely. In spite of its powerful motor, operation is very quiet, so quiet that my cats don't even run from it. The bags have a large capacity, which I appreciate. It's important to be aware, however, that these bags are not available in stores and must be ordered online. The wand is made of metal, sturdy but easy to take off and on. I love the telescoping feature that allows me to adapt for different areas and tasks. Although some reviewers complained that the hose pops off when you pull on it, I have not had this problem. The secret seems to be making sure the hose coupling clicks when installing it as noted in the instructions. The few quibbles I have are minor. I wish the cord access was higher up on the machine where it could be easily seen. I always have to lift up the machine and look for it. The power button and the cord retract button look alike and are marked so faintly that I constantly confused them. I put a dot of paint on the power button, so that's no longer a problem. The attachments are not so good, but then I haven't seen any in recent years that are. A little adaptor, costing about $5, allows me to use my old attachments. All in all, I am extremely pleased with this machine and amazed at getting this level of performance for such a low price.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: This is overdue but I wanted to provide an update on my previous issues with this vacuum and how they were handled. Within a few days, company representatives did contact me and shipped me a replacement wand and filter cover right away. The reps were very helpful and I appreciated it. I replaced the parts and so far so good. They still could not/would not provide me with a serial number for the unit so that I could register it on the Prolux site, which I still find strange. Maybe someone reading this review can give me some insight into why they can't provide that. I wanted the serial number because I purchased the Square Trade Protection Plan through Amazon when I bought this vacuum, which only goes into effect when the original warranty expires. I can't register for the original warranty so not sure how I would explain this to Square Trade if anything happens to the vacuum. The Prolux rep assured me that if I have any problems to just contact them. Not sure if the Protection Plan I purchased was just a waste of money, in that case. So ok...that's as far as I got with that. BUT I will say that the company reps were proactive and eager to help, so I was satisfied with that aspect in the end. It's still a good vacuum for the price, has really great suction, and is lightweight. Some people may not like the idea of dragging a canister around, but the canister is fairly light and has a handle. Also the long wand makes it much easier to vacuum under furniture without moving it. Heavy upright vacuums just can't do the same job, and if you have any kind of back problem, pushing around an upright vacuum is not ideal. I'm still pleased with this vacuum overall and glad the problems could be resolved.. So...that's the update. Hope this helps!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've had this vacuum since mid-August. It's now not quite mid-October. I've been using it regularly. The vacuum itself works well...suction is very good. Lightweight, quiet. Easy to use. However the inside of the metal vacuum wand that meets the black hard plastic part near the top of the wand is rusted inside, and that started weeks ago. The vacuum has had no contact with water and is kept in a perfectly dry closet. I'm puzzled as to why it would be rusted for any reason, especially so soon after purchase. In addition, in trying to remove the filter cover off the back yesterday -- gently! -- a small piece of plastic broke off of it and is now rattling around inside the unit. I'm fairly certain I don't have superhuman strength so I was pretty surprised something actually broke off during a routine cover removal. The plastic filter cover now is not firmly attached. I also tried to register the vacuum so it's under warranty, but I don't see a serial number visible anywhere, so I couldn't even do that. I emailed the company yesterday because they do not provide a customer service number on their website. Have not yet heard back from them, which I think is poor customer service. If a company only allows customers to send web messages regarding problems, at the very least they should return customer emails immediately. Does anyone have a customer service phone number for Prolux? I have to say I started out very enthusiastic about this vacuum but I'm disappointed that the parts should already be rusting, and so flimsy. I've never written an Amazon review before but I wanted to do so for this. I have to say I'm really annoyed. I'll update this review if they contact me.",
