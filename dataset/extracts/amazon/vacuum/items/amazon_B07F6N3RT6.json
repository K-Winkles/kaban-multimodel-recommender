        "description": "BISSELL\u00ae CleanView\u00ae Swivel Pet upright vacuum gives you the outstanding performance you\u2019d expect from an expert floorcare company at a great price. It has specialized pet tools and features, so you know it\u2019s designed for homes with pets. The TRIPLE ACTION\u2122 Brush Roll lifts, loosens and removes embedded pet hair and its silk-like bristles work gently on hard floors to remove fine debris while also keeping it contained with Scatter-Free Technology. Just as its name suggests, CleanView\u00ae Swivel Pet vacuum has Swivel Steering to get around and under furniture and other obstacles in your home. Pair that with edge-to-edge cleaning capabilities and you can clean with confidence knowing that you\u2019re getting more with each pass. As the vacuum captures dirt and debris, it passes through a filter while the multi-cyclonic suction helps keep dirt away from the motor and post-motor filter, for extended durability. At BISSELL, we know messes are not just contained to the floor, that\u2019s why we packed CleanView\u00ae Swivel Pet vacuum with specialized pet tools that carry right on the machine \u2013 giving you convenient pet cleaning, on or above the floor. And this machine doesn't just clean up after pets, it helps save them! BISSELL proudly supports BISSELL Pet Foundation\u00ae and its mission to help save homeless pets. When you buy a BISSELL product, you help save pets, too. We\u2019re proud to design products that help make pet messes, odors and pet homelessness disappear.",

The attachments are convienent and the stair/upholstory attachment works great. Leaves the carpet looking much cleaner than our old vac and I don't have to cut out hair from the roller like the old one. It's a bit heavier and like every vacuum the cord is 6\" too short to make it end up wrapping correctly (EVERY vac has this problem - why can't they figure it out?). All in all I'm very happy with it. Does a great job and the price was right.",

The newer cool-looking cordless \"wand\" sweepers are nice and convenient and light weight and I have had four of them, and I like them just fine except for the fact that they simply do not clean very well, and they do not have the suction power like this sweeper does! This sweeper is large and not as cool- looking but it cleans! It was priced competitive to the others as well, so the Bissell 2252 was a much better choice, and I am delighted with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace a Eureka Powerful NEU202. The Eureka (lasted less than two years) was a horrible choice and a vast downgrade from the previous version which I did like. It went together with ease, as most of them do, although you do need to screw in two screws for the handle. The Bissell works well and picks up pet hair great (the Eureka's dust cup would get clogged every few min..) The suction seems fine and the attachments are adequate. I have not used the pet turbo yet, as I have used those on a few other vacuums, and they all seem to work about the same and have the same failings. No new vacuum seems made to last now a days, as they are all made out of plastic. The cord is not long enough to do a large room, however not many of them are. I do miss the cord rewind and the lights on the Eureka, however most important was finding a vacuum that would actually work for sand (living in Florida that is a must) and pet hair without having to unclog something every five or ten minutes. We have four dogs, three of which have long hair. Of those three, two of them shed a few times a year. The Bissell had no problems with the hair. I thought I would dislike the swivel feature, however I hardly noticed it when vacuuming. So I can not say if that is an improvement or not, at least it is not a negative. I can not speak to it's durability, as I have only just received it, but I can say so far it is a great improvement over the Eureka, and as of now, I am happy with the purchase. I will update this review in a year or so (or sooner if it develops issues.)Pros:Washable filterDoes not have a filter cup that clogs continuously.a Few decent attachmentsGood suctionPicks up pet hair easilyCons:Cord is shorter than one would like.The extension attachment could be longerPlastic everything (But almost all of them are now.)",

I should have started looking sooner, but it\u2019s been about 6 months since we\u2019ve had a good vacuum across all the rooms in our house. I had a baby 6 months ago - and you know how it goes! \ud83d\ude06We don\u2019t have a pet, but we do host a lot and love to have friends over for dinner. That being said, there\u2019s always someone coming and going so I wanted to have a pet grade vacuum.I swiffer our house every week, and we are a very clean family\u2026So when I finally landed on this vacuum, I didn\u2019t know what to expect but the reviews were good! And this vacuum is AMAZING. This picture shows how much I got up from our carpets and rugs in one go. It was easy to put together, the cord is long enough, it\u2019s easy to empty the canister, and I like that you can use it on carpet and hardwood. It\u2019s not hard to push, and doesn\u2019t smell up the house like some vacuums tend to.Even if you don\u2019t have a pet, this is a great choice!",

From the first time I plugged this vacuum in, I knew it was a wonder. Floors and area rugs look brand new, and the long cord allows me to plug the vacuum in ONE TIME for each floor of my house! What a life changer for me. I can manage this vacuum with one arm, and it pulls out so much dirt/hair out of my carpets. Thank you Bissel! I've been searching awhile now to find what I needed. I also have an inexpensive robot disc for when I'm too tired to vacuum but this item works great, and picks up what the robot didn't. Robot disks cannot go up the stairs either.",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased this and it arrived last night. I put it together within 5-10 min and tried it out right away. I have always had DYSON PET-version vacuums for the past 15 years, so this was the first time I tried something much less expensive and non-Dyson.LOVE IT. The suction is way better than Dyson, even brand new out of the box. It is very lightweight and easy to maneuver, and I far prefer how the hose attachments stow and how easily they are put on the hose when needed. It\u2019s very easy to empty the canister, and when emptying the debris falls out much more easily than it every did on my Dysons. Also, the powerhead seamlessly goes from hard floors to low-pile mats and even my Great Dane\u2019s dog beds without having to change the setting (I kept it on 2 the whole time). And, the powerhead does a far better job of getting the edges clean than my Dyson did.The only downfall is that the cord length is about 10\u2019 shorter than my Dyson, so I have to re-plug it in as I go through the house (the Dyson reached everywhere in my raised bungalow without unplugging it). That\u2019s a minor inconvenience, easily fixed with an extension cord if I so choose, and not enough to lose any stars over.Obviously, longevity is an unknown. But, for the far more economical price I paid for this compared to any EXPENSIVE Dyson I\u2019ve bought in the past, replacing it every few years if needed is no big deal.",
