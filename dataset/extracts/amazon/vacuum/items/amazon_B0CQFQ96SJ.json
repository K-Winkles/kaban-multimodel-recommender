                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I loved the weight of this vacuum. It has good weight to it, and a nice feel to it. Also, the suction is very powerful. Using the handheld attachment, I was able to easily pick debris off the ground. But then I started seeing a few things that I didn't like about the vacuum. For one, when used for too, it overheats and shuts off. And it will stay shut off until it cools down. This has never happened to me with a hand vac. I wasn't using it for not even 10 minutes and the vac just completely shut off. Furthermore, it is corded. This is fine, but I would expect a corded vac to perform better and not overheat, but that wasn't the case. Also, I didn't like most of the attachments. The vacuum cleaner attachment was weak and barely picked up any debris, so it didn't really have a purpose to me. And unless you were using the vacuum cleaner attachment, the extensions were completely useless because you couldn't use the smaller suction wand with the extension pole. Overall, it shows promise but there needs to be a lot of improvement.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this vacuum has good suction, is easy to get under low surfaces and can double as a hand vac. I\u2019m used to stick vacs being cordless, so reaching the tether point end of the cord felt off, but I just changed outlets. The assembly is easy, but it took a bit of strength to get the bottom waste collection section off of the motor at first - this loosened up after doing it a few times, so, factory lock. The trigger switch is an on/off button, also not intuitive to those of us who\u2019ve been using stick vacs for years, but good news is you don\u2019t have to hold the trigger down to keep the vac going. The head is not powered and not a beater bar, it\u2019s just a spread of suction, but as mentioned, the suction is great - so great that you\u2019ll feel like a fan is on you as you use it since suction is a draw of air from one place to another, and in this case, it\u2019s flowing to the person using the vac - kinda fab, actually, since you get cooled while doing the sweaty job of cleaning. The non-powered non-beater bar head means you don\u2019t have to clean/unhair/unfur the beater bar - there is no beater bar to clean - which is great if you have linoleum/tile/wood floors, but less good if you\u2019re trying to clean a carpet, and if you\u2019ve got pets, you will have to brush off the hair/fur that clings to the outside of the head. I\u2019ve got wood floors with rugs, and it did a good job on getting the surface of the rugs clean and a great job on the smooth wooden floors. Converting to handheld is just a matter of taking off the stick parts and adding either the crevice tool or the smaller brush, and it\u2019s got the wired power to do a great job as a handheld. I also appreciated they included 2 spare filters. At this price, it\u2019s great deal on a vacuum that does a fabulous job on smooth floors and a good job on carpet and rugs.",

                "reviewText": "But the overheating protection feature is really a bummer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it picks up the little bits of dust and dirt on like every surface except for those thicker carpets that capture every little thing that comes into contact with them. But I literally used it for 10 minutes and barely collected anything in the waste bin with it and it cuts off and the motor is blazing hot. Filter is not dirty. I just don\u2019t see what good this does me if I have to wait an hour for it to cool down to turn it back on to finish the job. It would be a better use of my time to just sweep my carpets off! The overheat protection mode ensures that the vacuum doesn\u2019t get damaged. But it really defeats the entire purpose. Like, why not just put a heavy duty motor in it or something that can hold up to a 30 minute job at least? I wouldn\u2019t recommend. This is like, useless to me.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to use this vaccuum for my stairs since it seemed pretty lightweight. Overall, it is, but the back end might be a little heavy for some. I like how it's easy to maneuver under furniture and right up against the wall. The cord is pretty long, but I would love for it to be cordless. The suction seems to be okay, but what I really dislike is the immediate burning smell, the heat it produces, and hairdryer like wind it blows out.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Wow! This little thing has an amazing amount of power for a stick vac!! It\u2019s fantastic on floors and almost as good as a real vacuum on carpet. This will be great for an apartment set up. However, I also recommend for a large house when your time is limited for cleaning floors. I live in a huge house and I don\u2019t have time to spend hours on my only day off from work pushing the dirt around my hard floors with a broom only to have to keep bending over to pick it up with a dust pan. This stick vsac saved me a lot of time and can reach into the tight spots on my hard wood floors. I also have a soft lightweight carpet that this does a pretty good job at picking up debris and fluffing up.It\u2019s made of plastic and is very lightweight. However, the motor is at the top where the handle is so it gets a little top-heavy when I\u2019m pushing it around making my wrist get tired. The motor also tends to heat up a bit but not too hot.This is a fantastic vacuum. The reason I did not give this five stars is because:1. The unit is light weight on bottom and the top where the motor is is much heavier. This makes it a bit awkward to push around. It feels too top heavy.2. The dust cup is difficult to get on and off. Once I figured it out how to remove that and put it back on. I became easier though I still struggle a bit. The instructions are pretty useless with telling you how to empty the dust bin. There are 3 notches under the smoked plastic located at the top where it separates. You need to use a bright light to see through the dusk cup in order to see them. The instructions fail to mention that you need to twist the unit first, releasing the notches, THEN you can pull the dust cup apart from the motor. To put back together, the notches need to line up with the logo of the dust cup facing the top. I guess they are different size notches and it won't go back together unless this logo is facing up. Then you can slide back on and twist to secure.Overall, this is an incredible value for the money and is saving me an enormous amount of time cleaning my floors. I highly recommend this vacuum.",
