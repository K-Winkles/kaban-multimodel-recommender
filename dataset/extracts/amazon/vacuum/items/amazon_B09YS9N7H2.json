It\u2019s super light weight, suction is out of this world, the air feels so much cleaner after one use and it\u2019s extremely easy to dump. Also super satisfying to see how much it gathers in a short amount of time. At first I wished the battery life lasted longer, but that was because I had it on turbo the whole time. But I\u2019ve learned when I need to use turbo vs not and I\u2019ll switch h back in forth (which is super easy) and it will last for the full upstairs and the steps and some of downstairs before it needs charged again. I have a 2,500 square foot home. I also have 2 motorized vacuums in my house, but there is nothing like a Dyson! It just does the job so much better, especially on carpet. I also have a golden retriever that sheds a ton, and a cat! So I love all the different attachments to clean everything, but just the floor. Totally worth the money! And the fact that it\u2019s cordless and light weight makes it so easy to clean!",

It is not enough to clean the whole family home without needing to recharge or using a cord.",

Small enough that it can be stored just about anywhere, but unless it is kept plugged in, it will lose its charge - something to keep in mind. The bin is not that large and has to be emptied frequently if vacuuming large spaces, especially in a house with a lot of girls and a lot of hair like ours, but I guess it\u2019s a trade off for the lightweight and portability. If there was one thing I would change, and probably would not have purchased had I known about it beforehand, is the on switch. It would be great if it could lock into place while using, but with this model, you have to hold it down the entirety of the vacuum cycle and my finger is numb and painful by the time I\u2019m finished. The switch is also on the carry handle and very easy to trigger it on by accident.",

It picks up little scraps of paper really easily and I am surprised at the size of item it will suction up into the chamber. Then when the chamber is full, this vacuum is so easy to empty!! I purchased a knockoff a few about a year ago, thinking I would save some money, it was difficult to empty so I finally broke down and bought the Dyson, the real deal and I am happy that I did. My only complaint is that I wish the charge would last a little bit longer.",

Attaches to the wall nicely with the power cord incorporated so it automatically connects when hanging it up...no loose cord hanging down when not plugged in. It has great suction power and the best feature for me is that it gets under beds and furniture where large vacuums can't get to!",

It came with a 2 yr. warranty and was easy to register. The quick start guide was great and within a couple of minutes I was using it. It doesn't hold a charge for too long, maybe 10 minutes, but that's enough vacuuming for me. I use a robot vacuum to do most areas but it doesn't do corners or around furniture legs so the combo is working for me.",
