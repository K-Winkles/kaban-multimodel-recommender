                "reviewText": "This vacuum came packaged extremely well and assembly was simple and user friendly. It is very lightweight, yet all parts are sturdy and click together firmly. It has sufficient suction and brush power to handle all vacuuming tasks other than deep carpets and rugs. The light on the front is a nice bonus, as is its quietness. It converts to a hand-held vacuum easily, and is easy to clean with the one-click removeable dust-bin canister and rotating brush head. Battery life is good and is easily tracked via the digital dial on the handle. I recommend this product as an excellent all-in-one replacement for basic corded electric brooms, hand-held rechargeable Dust Buster-type vacuums, and conventional rechargeable battery-powered sweepers--it is more powerful, runs longer, and much easier to use.",

                "reviewText": "This vacuum cleaner is a very good product as it does what we exactly needed to do in our house. First of all we appreciate how very lightweight it is, even our kids can easily use it. We love the fact that we can use it anywhere in the house without any restrictions, no more hassle on replugging cords. It has 2 modes of suction power and you can also see the percentage of its battery. The battery life was pretty decent, it can get a full clean of the first floor in our house in one go. And the good thing is that it charges fast. It\u2019s good on carpet, hardwood and tiled floors. Great for quick little pick ups as well as on the stairs. It\u2019s easy to put together, swivels easily, and very easy to empty the tank and clean the filter. Aside from all the features and its functionality it also comes with 3yrs warranty. We definitely recommend this product.",

It is very easy to assemble, very lightweight, very maneuverable, easy to use, and compact (which allows for ease of storage). Its little headlights perform well and really help to see where the vacuuming is needed. It has good sucking power but the way the battery drains so quickly is a disappointment. Also, it took a couple hours to fully charge the battery. A bigger battery should be offered. I like the vac but the battery life leaves much to be desired.",

                "reviewText": "It was a long process of reading different reviews for different products, and I am glad I decided to go with Roanow stick vacuum! Very easy to put together. Light weight and GREAT suction! It has a light that really helps see better while vacuuming. It runs great, I used it twice so far on hardwood floors and the battery is nowhere near empty. It slides so nice under beds, sofas, etc. I used it mostly on hardwood floors, and a few entrance carpets, and it vacuums great on both surfaces! It\u2019s so much easier now to run a vacuum quick and give the house a quick cleanup. I haven\u2019t tried the attachments yet, but they will be very convenient for many different areas and uses. The only thing I\u2019d change on it is the ON/OFF button. It sits just under your fingers while holding the unit and vacuuming, which makes you shut it off accidentally. But \u2026 it\u2019s just a matter of getting used to it. Love it! Would buy again for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this vacuum for a little while and wanted to leave a review!Pros:It keeps its charge well and when it dies it has a quick charge with a smaller amount of power (like a 25% charge in a couple minutes) so you can finish a job a little more easily than the big-name vacuums that take a long time to charge before you can use them again. The full charge takes longer, but I was impressed at the small amount of power that you get quickly.The filter shown above was VERY dirty and I spent about 10-15 minutes on turbo mode (because it needed a lot of work!) and it only used 30% of the battery. (The purifier filter is \"stained\" with dust in some areas since we let it go for a very long time without cleaning it, so the after might not look squeaky clean, but it is! The air feels so much cleaner now.) Also showing the lovely digital display!In my previous Shark vacuum, turbo mode had to be held down the entire time to be used. This vacuum only requires a single button press. It sounds like a small thing, but my hands fatigue easily, and it\u2019s a really nice feature.Speaking of fatigued hands, this thing is LIGHT compared to the Shark. This vacuum is much easier to carry and maneuver despite having weak hands/wrists.It is quiet! Even on turbo, it doesn't bother my dog at all.I love the thoughtful touch of the additional filters and a special cleaning tool.The plug in charger is also small and lightweight, which is a nice change from the giant chargers from my last vacuum.It's visually streamlined and colorful and looks so expensive! My last vacuum cost almost twice as much as this one and didn't look nearly as nice. I wouldn't mind this one being on display as much.It did great with dog hair pickup too!It has a battery that comes off the unit so you don't have to charge it in the same place you store it! It makes charging so much less awkward. I'm curious if they sell replacement batteries, since it looks like you could probably swap them out (and always have one charged for infinite vacuum time! Lol).Cons:I wasn't able to test this vacuum on carpet since I only have hard floors with solid mats, so I can't speak to how well it works on carpet.My last vacuum was an expensive Shark, and in comparison, I felt that the suction was less in this vacuum. However, if I used it exclusively in turbo mode, it did a good job! The battery life is way better than the Shark (and infinitely better than the older 10-minute Dyson stick vacuum I had before that!), so if I have to take a little extra time I don't mind, since I still get further with this vacuum than with its predecessors before the battery dies.It is great for light daily cleanup. I still have my shop-vac for heavier messes which works out great. Brooms are hard for me because of difficulty bending down and this is much better.5 stars for daily cleanup on hard floors, looking expensive, the charge time and battery capacity, and that removable battery (especially if the company has extra batteries available for purchase - and if they don't, they totally should!).",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After ordering this vacuum on Amazon, I received it in a couple of days. All the items in the box were well packed and nothing damaged. After charging the battery, I was able to clean two floors of the house with a single charge. Comes with a few attachments that allows you to use it for different types of cleaning. With two speeds, we use it not only for wood, ceramic and carpet floors but also for other items like furniture, cars, computer keyboards, window blinds, ventilation grills and lots more. The fact that the vacuum is light and very quiet and doesn\u2019t tire you when using it for long period of time is a plus. It\u2019s always ready to use for those quick cleanups, especially in the bathroom and kitchen. I like the design and blue color along with the display which gives you various information like battery status and which speed you\u2019re using. Emptying the dust cup is quick and easy, just pressing the button of the vacuum cleaner over a garbage can, all the dirt comes out easily. The led light on the floor brush helps light up those dark areas of the house. The bracket to hang the vacuum has all the accessories you need all in one place. Makes you want to clean more often versus using other bigger and bulker vacuum cleaners. At this price, it\u2019s a great purchase and would definitely recommend this Roanow Marsvac S1 cordless vacuum cleaner.",

Er ist sehr leicht und wendig und man kann auch gut unter dem Sofa oder dem Bett saugen. Mit der Saugleistung bin ich sehr zufrieden. Tierhaare und normale Kr\u00fcmel werden im Ecomodus zuverl\u00e4ssig aufgenommen. Katzenstreukr\u00fcmel sind mit dem einfach hinzuschaltbaren Turbo auch kein Problem. Mit der Beleuchtung vor der B\u00fcrste lassen sich Schmutz und Staub sehr gut erkennen. Die Akkuleistung ist bei Hartb\u00f6den auch f\u00fcr gr\u00f6ssere Wohnungen v\u00f6llig ausreichend, wie es sich bei Teppichb\u00f6den verh\u00e4lt kann ich nicht beurteilen. Ich habe nur ein grosses Kuhfell, aber auch dieses wird sehr gut von Staub und Kr\u00fcmeln befreit. Der Umbau zum Handsauger ist auch sehr simpel, genau wie das Entleeren des Schmutzbeh\u00e4lters. Auch die Reinigung desselben ist einach. Der Ger\u00e4uschpegel ist angenehm. Ich habe das Ger\u00e4t jetzt seit 6 Wochen in t\u00e4glichem Betrieb und bin immer noch begeistert. Ich habe mir sogar vor kurzem noch ein zweites Ger\u00e4t bestellt f\u00fcr die Oberwohnung. Preis/Leistung sind absolut top. Ganz klare Kaufempfehlung.",
