I recommend it to my family, because of the fact that there\u2019s no cord and so many attachments.I have a small house, maybe 1100 sq ft, I\u2019m not sure but it\u2019s small. I say this because, the battery is not reliable. Sometimes I can charge it and it will last me through two rooms, and sometimes, it last the whole house.After 2 years, I have learned that this vacuum should be used in steps- based on the accessories.The long vacuum part should be used for carpetsThe long skinny one for cracks and crevicesThe small long rectangle one is for furniture, but I like to use it if my daughter crunches cheese it\u2019s in the floor, it\u2019s great for messes in carpet.Would also be good for deep cleaning, but the battery wouldn\u2019t last.I don\u2019t use the one with the extendable brush, it\u2019s small, I would think it\u2019s good for dusting? But I can\u2019t find a good use for it. Lamp shades, maybe?The battery lasts different depending on which accessory you use, so the long vacuum doesn\u2019t usually last through my whole house, I guess because it powers both the top and bottom of the vacuum.The long skinny crevice one, it lasts a while!Overall, I\u2019d buy it again in a heartbeat, but not if I had a big house, you would want multiple. But if you can afford that, I\u2019d have one on every floor.Original review belowVery durable, very convenient... not very powerful, and the battery life is sooo bad.I read the reviews before buying this, I mean it is an expensive a$$ vacuum, so I knew that the battery life wasn\u2019t anything to write home about, but seeing as I live in a 1000sqft house, I didn\u2019t think I would have to worry about it.Wrong. I never get through the house without it dying and when it does die, it\u2019s sudden. No warnings, just... dead.Also it\u2019s important to know that when it stops running, sometimes it\u2019s not dead, it\u2019s just clogged.There is a switch to change it from high powered to normal power so that could help the battery life.And you don\u2019t just turn it on and go, you have to pull the trigger the entire time.For the money I spent on this I would\u2019ve bought an off brand, higher powered, more practical vacuum that I wouldn\u2019t have cared had it only lasted a year.I\u2019m stuck with this dyson now, but I\u2019m not thrilled about it.Please let me know if you found this review helpful!",

                "reviewText": "Based on my rating I have obviously come to praise the V7 rather than bury it. I gave it 6 moths before I wrote this, but I love it. LOVE IT! It is so very light and convenient and picks up a lot of hair from my border collie and min pin. What I really like is that you can get underneath furniture with it, you have to bend down a bit, but that is where a lot dust and hairballs gather. I like that the main attachment head swivels so you can get into corners pretty well. Now the battery does not last a very long time, we have a 1200 sq ft house and I almost get to the end one charge. BUT, I usually use the high suction. Using the lower suction does prolong the battery, and it works well, but I like the high suction. So what if you have to charge before you finish, take a break with your favorite beverage and celebrate your genius in buying this while it charges back up! The other complaint I read is that you have to keep the on button pressed while is use. Come on you weaklings, I actually prefer it that way as you can stop it with the trigger release rather than pressing a button off and on. So you save battery life too, you are welcome. And the attachments are great too, especially for indulgent parents who let their dogs on the sofa and get hair on it. I love that it hangs up neatly in our laundry space, to charge and ready to go. There are not too many things that work this well in this life, highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Update: one year laterI still love this vacuum!!! It is still in perfect condition. So easy to use, especially under the beds and corners. I bought this months ago and waited to write a review because I wanted to get good use of it first.It is the best vacuum for pet owners!! We have tile and carpet. Vacuum has 2 settings for suction power. My tile: I use the lower setting and it picks up everything from fur to pine pellets. It is so easy to maneuver around corners and tight spots. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it though because I wasn't used to having a vacuum that swivels.Carpet: I use the lower setting and it picks up so much!! We have 4 cats 3 are med to long hair so we have a lot of fur. It does great! Now, I still use a corded vacuum twice a month because corded will have more suction power.The second setting with the stronger suction is GREAT! It really gets stuff out, but it drains the battery too quickly. I use this setting to vacuum under the beds. It lays almost flat and I can get all the way past the middle so the whole area gets clean. (My bulky corded vacuum can't reach under beds)Furniture:Excellent!!! It comes with accessories and I haven't used them all yet but the brush attachment for couches/chairs is perfect. I'd say it gets about 98% of the fur off the couch if not 100%. It has been a game changer for us in dealing with the fur.Our home is 2000 square feet and I can vacuum the whole house in one charge on the low setting.It is definitely worth the money I paid.Durability:I have banged this thing so much getting under the kitchen table and in closets, but it still works like new. It is an amazing vacuum. It makes me happy emptying that canister full of fur, dust, and whatever else it picked up from our floors.",

However I feel like on high the suction is almost too much - there was a tendency to really lock down on the carpet and not want to move \u2013, and the low setting seems perfect. I\u2019m not a gigantic fan of the way you open the thing up to dump out the dirt. The decision to make visible parts of the cleaner out of shiny clear plastic is a bit suspect given that this thing will be grimy and dirty after one use. But overall for cleaning power I am very pleased.",
