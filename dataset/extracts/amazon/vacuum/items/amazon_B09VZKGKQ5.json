                "reviewText": "OMG where do I begin. I love this vacuum. It is small and lightweight. Do not let the fact that it is small and cordless deter you from buying it. It is very powerful and great for hardwood floors and area rugs. I do not have carpet so I can't say how well it will work on them, but it works great on my area rugs. The battery does only work for about 35 minutes, but it charges very quickly. I have pets so I use it every day multiple times a day and no more pet hair everywhere. It comes with a curtain/upholstery attachment and a crevice attachment. The handle is adjustable. It also comes with 4 of the Hepa filters, which you can rinse off and reuse. The top attachment can be removed and used as a hand vac for smaller spaces with the crevice attachment. I think it is well priced and as I said I love it. I just need to find a replacement battery which i have not seen available yet.",

I've had it for 2 months now, and let's just say, it gets used hard. Like 5-10 times a day! It's what I use for daily cleaning. I do have to say it doesn't deep clean like my corded one, but it's awesome for daily clean up. I vacuum the entire upstairs, which is where the dogs sleep, so lots of hair, and it's a real powerhouse.I definitely recommend this vacuum. I did purchase the warranty as well.",

                "reviewText": "Been looking around for affordable wireless but functional vacuums. Was doing research for black Friday when a friend told me of this vacuum she purchased a year ago. This is exactly what I need for my little apartment. It's a pretty powerful and light with a nice swivel that can get into little space under my couch. And the suction grabs all the hairs I shed, even the ones on my small rug. The transition from vinal floor to carpet is smooth and I can easily switch to the handheld to get in the crevices that the vacuum can't get into. The fact it comes with 4 filters tells me this company isn't stingy on making sure you get a good quality vacuum that can capture all the dust that can give you the sneezes while dusting and cleaning. And honestly will keep me as a long time buyer for this brand. The attachments are very helpful and allow me to get in-between my sliding windows where dust can form while the brush helps with getting the lint off my bathroom fan vent which is \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffdI do however have some cons: battery time. I'm lucky, my apartment is pretty small, so more than 30 or 45min of vacuuming isn't a thing BUT, if I want a good vacuuming with the highest suction setting, the battery goes quickly, like in 15/20 min. Other than that, I can easily plug it in to charge which gives me a lil break on the clean up.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this stick vac. I bought it during prime days to replace an old stick vac I had bought 3 years ago that broke. This one is far superior to my old one. Features that I love are: it actually sucks debris and hair off all of the surfaces in my home, it stands up on its own, the accessories attach right to it so they aren\u2019t laying in a closet somewhere, the battery pops off and can be charged independently, it\u2019s easy to use, lightweight, it has led lights on the floor brush roll, I can go on and on. It only took about an hour to fully charge the first time. The battery is down 1 bar since a full charge after one day. But I can\u2019t stop vacuuming everything in my house. It even picked up grass that was stuck on to my entry mats. My big vacuum can barely do that. This is prob not a vacuum to do a whole house full of carpet or heavy duty deep cleaning for hours but if you want something for in between guests, crumbs from your kids, those hairball tumbleweeds from pets or whatever other annoying messes that happen\u2026this vac is amazing. I would 100% buy this again and recommend it to others. Can\u2019t go wrong with this one, buy it!",

I loved the look of the product the minute I saw it.Firstly, This vacuum was really light to handle, and very easy to assemble. I have carpel tunnel syndrome in both hands- so it was important to me that this vacuum not be too heavy to manover, or push , awkward to store or difficult to use. The attachments have an easy clip attached to them that snaps easily together.I vacuumed my carpets, luxury vinyl flooring, basement steps, and even the inside my car with it. Let me tell you ... I was impressed with the power of this thing, despite its small & lightweight size. It\u2019s not bulky heavy awkward or very noisy. But remember to note: it\u2019s not a shop vac !I waited for about 20 minutes to charge up the battery- when the 3 solid bars were flashing it was ready for use( so Not too long to charge at all ) I did all my vacuuming with it in about 20 minutes. I used the slim crevice attachment for the corners, crevices, under my furniture. And on the basement stairs. Trust me it works perfectly and I was very happy with the results ( like the amount of pet hair/ dirt/ debris it collected) I collected a big ball of fur/ dirt & debris I didn\u2019t even know I had on my floors.Read / review & follow instructions if you want optimal use if this vacuum. and I\u2019m sure you will not be disappointed with the results.Follow directions.It stands on its on in my broom closet or you can screw the attachment base into a wall. It turns off and in really quickly once charged.It\u2019s just what I needed to pick up my dog / cat hair loose debris, and car floor debris on carpets.The battery base and attachments lightly snap into place and the slim nozzle ends did a really good in the crevices and corners.",

The suction ain't that great for big messes, but other than that it gets the job done. The battery will need to be charged after every use (depends on how long you use it for).Overall, great product, easy to assemble, light and quiet.",
