It comes with an extra filter and extra parts.One thing that I appreciate is how the charger has a green light when it\u2019s charging and is red when it\u2019s done. There\u2019s no indicator on the vacuum itself so that\u2019s very convenient. The vacuum itself works really well and is lightweight.I have another one and after holding it for a minute or so, my arm gets tired so I really like how lightweight this one is. I can vacuum all the crumbs in my car with ease. There\u2019s also a light at the front so it helps to see what I\u2019m vacuuming in dark places. Never seen that option before and didn\u2019t realize how key it was.Easy to empty and change out filter.",

It is very lightweight and easy to handle, and it has a strong suction power that can pick up dust, dirt, crumbs, and pet hair. It comes with two attachments: a crevice tool and a brush tool, which are useful for different surfaces and corners. It also has a spare filter and a wall charger, which are convenient and practical. The battery life is long enough for me to finish my cleaning tasks without interruption. The only downside is that it is a bit noisy, but that is not a big deal for me. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a cordless vacuum cleaner for car and home.",

I recently decided to upgrade to this model, but I have another vacuum from this company that has been going strong for over three years. I have a cat and a three year old, so it gets a ton of use. This vacuum charges fast and lasts for a long time. The light is bright and super helpful in those dark corners. It comes with a few attachments that I use often. They even include an extra filter. It is super easy to clean and stores nicely in the box. Buy it-you won't regret it!",

This one is lightweight and has very strong suction power. It cleaned the small bits of dog food for my carpet with these. As you can see my wife has very long hair and that sheds everywhere. This vacuum easily cleaned all of that up as you can see by all of that stuff in the canister. I can\u2019t wait to try it outside in my car. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking to cut the cord and trying out a new cordless vacuum that is easy to use an effective.",

I put in the extension (crevice attachment). that makes it longer and I don\u2019t have to bend down as far. It picks up dog hair and most anything that they drag in. Suction is very strong. It charges quickly and has a bright light that shows when it\u2019s charging and when it\u2019s done. The led spot light is really bright and doesn't seem to drain the battery any.It seems solid and well made. I was able to install the filter quickly. The filter is also washable. That\u2019s a plus. The filter needs to be cleaned pretty often. The coating of lint has to be brushed off it. I would take it outside to clean it and maybe knock the filter on the side of your house to get all the dust out. I haven\u2019t tried it for cleaning the car but I\u2019m sure it would work great for that also. I got it to replace the old one that hung on the wall charger. Do they still make those ha.",
