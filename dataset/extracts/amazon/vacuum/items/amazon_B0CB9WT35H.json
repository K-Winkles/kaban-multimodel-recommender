Cleaning it works as a charm, as the chamber holding the trash is propelled out from filter, so one doesn't need to put one's hands inside the chamber to empty it. It's super convenient to clean the stairs now. In fact, cleaning is very easy anywhere, as one just grabs the vacuum, clean what need to be cleaned, and it's finished. The suction power is very good for cleaning fluffy rugs too. Attaching and detaching accessories is very easy. Extremely well thought. This product is a game changer to me. I haven't even used my robot vacuums in a while.",

                "reviewText": "Who doesn't love Dyson? I have wanted a wire free Dyson vacuum for a long time. It does a wonderful job vacuuming. I have mostly hardwood floors and a few rugs. It is amazing to use on the wood floors. It picks up everything including dog hair. On the rugs it makes them look clean and vacuumed. I love all of the attachments it comes with. It is light weight and easy to maneuver. I am 56 years old and not in the best condition, so when I say it is light weight and easy to maneuver, I am being honest. I can vacuum the house much quicker since there is no cord to fight with or having to change electric outlets because the cord wont stretch throughout the entire house. I hate to vacuum, but this Dyson makes it enjoyable and a quick, easy chore to accomplish. I have not ran out of battery power while vacuuming. I have a 1600 square foot home and I have yet to run out of power before I am finished vacuuming the house.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased December 2023, for about $400 through Amazon (Dyson's website had the same holiday price). I didn't initially want to spend this much money on a vacuum but we have little kids, and use the vacuum a lot, so I'm glad we got a quality vacuum that works for us. Totally worth it!We did a lot of research and finally landed on the Dyson V11 Cordless Stick Vaccum. We previously had a stand up Shark pet pro vacuum but this blows that out of the water!! We vacuumed areas that have been previously vacuumed with the other vacuum but the dyson picked up SO MUCH DUST/DIRT! Where was all that dirt hiding??! \ud83d\udc40 The vacuum has a little weight to it, but even with a fractured arm, I'm still able to maneuver it a little awkwardly with a bit of extra support. Be aware that you have to hold the power button down the entire time while you vacuum- there is no just \"on\" switch. This is to conserve battery life. As soon as you finger comes off the trigger, power goes off. The switch doesn't require tons of pressure so I'm not sure why people are complaining about their hands hurting from holding the button. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My nearly 4 year old can hold the vacuum, power button down and maneuver it on his own (not as fast or agile as an adult, but by himself nonetheless)- if that gives you an idea for weight. The suction is powerful and has several levels to pick from that affect the battery life (which will show you on a digital display how much run time you have based on the level of suction power you select) , emptying the dustbin is easy. And with the vacuum being cordless my husband is even excited to vacuum now! If you're on the fence- spend the money, make your life a little easier and get something quality that will do a great job cleaning and last a long time.",

                "reviewText": "To start, I always buy $120 off brand cordless vacuums from Amazon that die after 1 year. They work fine, but I always find myself annoyed when they don\u2019t last. I told myself that if it happened again, I was shelling out the money for a Dyson because I want longevity and function.This did not disappoint! I have 2 shedding cats and 2 messy little boys who keep me vacuuming at a minimum of 2x per day, most days more. So vacuuming is VERY important to me and I need something good.Immediately I was disappointed that the v11 doesn\u2019t have a light feature so you can see all the dust, as well as the fact that I have to hold down the power button to make it work, but those things weren\u2019t deal breakers because the canister was full after one go-round in my son\u2019s room (that I vacuum every day!) I was disgusted and amazed at the suction power and all the dust and ick that it collected, I didn\u2019t care about what I was missing (that you can have if you pay $200 more.)The power of this vacuum is truly amazing, I am so so pleased I bought it. I have had to empty the canister several times because there was so much dust in the rooms that my Amazon vacuum wasn\u2019t collecting. Off brand just doesn\u2019t compare.You won\u2019t regret this purchase.",

Lost 90% of its suction and just pushed the dirt around for a few days and then just wouldn\u2019t turn on any more. We were always diligent with emptying the canister and making sure the filter wasn\u2019t clogged, but the vacuum gave out after only a month anyway. Very disappointed. The only reason we spent the extra money on this was because the advertising led us to believe that Dyson was the best you could get and would never lose suction-definitely not the case!",
