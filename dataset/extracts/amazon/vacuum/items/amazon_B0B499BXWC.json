                "reviewText": "I have a Dyson cordless, and it is finicky when larger items (like bits of wood that fall on my floor when I put logs in the fireplace) get trapped in the tube. And because the Dyson has a beater bar, it is too vigorous for silk and wool carpets. So I was looking for a suction-only vacuum that would be suitable for wood chips as well as hand-woven carpets. This vacuum is the perfect solution. It got all the dirt up off the wool carpets, and it handily vacuumed up all of the small wood chips around my wood-burning stove. I used the narrow brush attachments to vacuum up stray bits of cold ash that has settled on the front of the stove, and it worked well.I debated about cordless or electric, and it was the price that convinced me to buy the electric. This is the lightest vacuum I have ever owned, so it goes up and down the stairs with no problem. I love that I can detach the handle (or just hold it low on the handle) and use it like a Dust Buster. Extremely versatile, enough suction power for my cleaning needs, and the many attachments will be useful for odd cleaning jobs, as well as the occasional cobweb.I would advise users to pay attention to the amount of dirt/dust that collects around the filter cup. After vacuuming one of my large carpets, I opened the top and cleaned off the collar of fine dust and debris that was clinging to the filter, so the vacuum would continue to get strong suction. It was very easy to do. The instructions mentioned something about not letting the motor get overheated, so I am vigilant about regular cleaning, just like with a Roomba.",

                "reviewText": "I have sciatica. There is something about vacuuming that just sets it off. I can sweep, I can mop, but I could not vacuum. Now I can vacuum again, and this little thing has surprisingly good suction. I will tell you that most of my floors are hard surfaces, but it works well on the carpet I do have. The filter is washable, but I found just using a dust broom to dust it out, works best. The attachments are nice, but they give you too many and they have to be stored somewhere. I purchased a small net laundry bag. It would have been nice if they provided a bag. So, my only complaint is that they give you too much.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this vacuum! The seller shipped it promptly, and it arrived 3 days earlier than expected! This vacuum has several strengths: it works extremely well on hard floor surfaces and upholstery. I have a cat that sheds all over, and my sofa is always covered in cat hair. I didn't even bother attaching one of the other vacuum brush heads, as it's so lightweight I just used the whole vacuum on the couch! And as you can see from the pictures, the vacuum got all the hair up! It has a surprisingly strong suction for such a small machine. The biggest downside that I noticed is that the vacuum isn't quite strong enough to be effective on carpet. I have a big area rug that it struggled to suck all the bits of lint and grime out of. In addition, the plastic it is made out of felt pretty cheap. It sort of reminded me of the toy vacuum I had as a kid... Yet because of its small size and light weight, I could get into every tiny corner of my apartment without a problem. It is highly maneuverable and came with plenty of different attachments depending on the type of cleaning you need to do. Overall, this is a great beginner vacuum and would work well in a small apartment or house with hard floors. That's exactly what I needed it for, and at this price, I think it was a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "It's lightweight, easy to move, and has pretty okay suctioning power. Is it perfect? No. It's cheap and you can feel that as you're using it. But it works as an affordable option when you only need it for a small space, such as a studio apartment, car, or even a bedroom.The instructions for putting the pieces together were a little unclear, but aside from that, my experience with the vacuum is great!",
