I've tried a bunch of different battery powered, or portable, vacuums and they all stink. I do have an APU (onboard diesel generator) so I have access to outlet power. I wanted something super small that I could keep in one of the small drawers but had enough power to actually pick stuff off my floor. This does just that. It is super cheaply made, if I used it for more than 5 minutes a day I'm sure it wouldn't last very long, but for the price I paid I would 100% buy it again. This does a great job of picking up all the little rocks you get from going through gravel shippers and has enough suction to pull all of the dirt out of the little nooks and crannies.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to purchase this item not because of the low price but for the simple fact that they would show the entire vacuum. The biggest disappointment is that there is no roller on this unit.Now I understand that some people don\u2019t want the roller but I do. My entire house is hardwood floors but I have found that the rollers made for smooth floors does a lot better than those without.Though this vacuum did everything it said, the suction wasn\u2019t as powerful as one would need. The bottom design didn\u2019t allow for complete pickup and you have to go over more than once to pick up everything. The motor got hot enough to burn you andthough the the swivel is good on the head, it will not allow you to lay the vacuum flat to get under low furniture as the lower you go the vacuum begins to lift off the floor.It\u2019s an ok vacuum for basic pickup but anything further that will have you looking elsewhere.Here\u2019s the kicker. You won\u2019t see this on Amazon or their selling page but I received this email from them after my purchase even before I received the product. Catch what it says\u2026Many thanks for your purchase! Hope our vacuum cleaner can be your effective assistant for cleaning.*NOTE: Due to powerful suction and high power, it might be easy to fit tightly with high-pile carpet, so it is not suitable for use on thick carpets, perfect for hard floors.Here are other 3 notes about using a corded vacuum cleaner:1. Please clean the brush, filter, and dust box regularly to keep the maximum suction, and please don't forget to put the inlet filter pad back after fully air drying.2. It's common that the temperature of the motor part is higher than in other parts during use. Please don't worry, INSE I5 has a high-power motor to provide decent suction, and it features over-heating protection for safe use.3. If vacuum loses sution or shuts off suddenly. Please clean the filters and the blockage in time, wait for a few minutes to let the motor cool down, and it can start again.",
