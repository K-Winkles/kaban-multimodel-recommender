                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Terrific Vacuum for hardwood floors",
                "reviewText": "Our house has hardwood floors and some low pile carpets. We have a short hair dog and living by the shore we deal with sand. The INSE is terrific. We can easily vacuum our house daily and it does a great job picking up hair, crumbs, sand and dirt, largely because of the POWERED head. The attachments are perfect for baseboards and window tracks. It typically takes us about 20 minutes to vacuum our whole house and we've had no issues on battery life, even on the \"turbo\" setting. It does take a few hours to charge a depleted battery, so be aware. I've accidentally dropped the unit a few times and it survived without issue. It has proven to be really durable. It is very easy to clean - PROVIDED you only vacuum up dry messes. Anything with moisture causes a problem and you have to disassemble the unit to clean it properly. This isn't a replacement for a regular corded vacuum if you need lots of suction (the \"economy mode\" is worthless - only the Turbo mode is useful), and it probably won't work well if you have a lot of pile carpeting or pile rugs. For example, it doesn't work well on our patterned doormat. For hard surfaces in turbo mode - it is surprisingly good for the price and with its light weight and easy to clean design, it's a great everyday picker-upper.Nov 2023 update:We use this vacuum every day and for us it works super well. We have hard surfaces and it has performed really well. One suggestion - take the advice of the instructions and clean the filter regularly. Any comments about loss of suction I've seen I would imagine is related to not doing this. Let me say, it is out of the warranty period and, again, we use it at least every day - and often much more. Recently, we had the connector hose break in the power head and I reached out to INSE support expecting to have to pay for a new part or, more likely, have to re-buy the vacuum. Boy was I wrong! I got a response within 24 hours and they asked for some pictures and my order number from Amazon. I sent along the information and within a day a new power head was shipped to me - no argument, no run-around, no hassle. I only wish other sellers on AMZ had the same focus on customer service. Sure you can build a great product, but standing behind your product is priceless in today's world. This has been the best ~$100 I've spent on something in a long time. Bravo INSE, Bravo.",

                "reviewText": "Warranty honored! I contacted the seller who gave me my warranty info which I forwarded to support@inselife.com The service was quick, the process took a few weeks with us first receiving a new charger and then receiving a replacement battery which did the trick. The warranty is for 2 years from the date you receive it from Amazon. I\u2019m please to have in back in service. I only gave 4 stars back, because I believe they did know there was a battery issue and it would have been nice if the issued a recall. I noted the email address for warranty or customer service. support@inselife.comUpdate 7/21: Originally we loved this unit, for quick pick-ups. but it stopped working after 5 months, Not worth the price we paid. We were very careful with in, hung it after every use, kept it clean and charged the battery when low. I don't recommend buying it now. will update again if they make good on the warranty.Perfect for my needs. Easy to assemble, easy to use and store whether you are hanging on the supplied hook or disassembling to store in a small space. Well thought out design. There is not enough information on the dust bin. It comes completely apart with TWO washable filter. I\u2019ll wash mine after each use. Because the inside filter does it\u2019s job and picks up the finest particles. It did such a good job, I couldn\u2019t see the photo of a faucet (symbol for washing) under all the dust.I live on the beach (sand!) have laminate wood with low pile area rugs and it\u2019s does pick up lots German Shepherd dog hair off a the low pike rug. Picks up flour off the floor. It excels on hardwood, tile and laminate floor. Great for stairs. The brush tools DO SNAP DIRECTLY to the power vac motor to make cleaning easier.Now I\u2019ll talk about cat litter - perfect job picking up litter on hard floor and a low pile rug with both the power head or the tools.So many options with this unit. I paid $130. But a day later there was a coupon for an additional $18 off.My only suggestion is to be sure to hang it or lay it down when not in use so it doesn\u2019t fall. It\u2019s too heavy of course.If you are looking for deep cleaning a pile rug, this is not going to be your go to vacuum. It sure does a great job otherwise. I think you will be pleased not hauling a cord around makes keeping a clean house with a dog, cat, kids, and adults easy.Add it to your cart, I don\u2019t think you will find better fir the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have a German shepherd. That pretty much says it all. The dust cup is small and so I have to empty frequently but it is so quick and easy that is not a problem. The system choked when I overfilled it with dog fur. Easy to assemble. Light and highly maneuverable. My only problem came when I tried and tried and TRIED to get the dust collection unit back together and I was so frustrated I actually looked at the directions. Genius! Problem solved! This is still brand new so durability is not known yet.I really like this vacuum but sadly it is not suited to my home. My apartment is about 1400 sq ft. And is all hardwood floors but my heavy-coated German shepherds fur plugs the vacuum very quickly and I have to take it apart to release the blockage. It would function very nicely in a home with shorthaired pets . I like how it handles with a very nimble head, good, suction and light weight ease. It can easily vacuum under low furniture. So this is not working for me but could be. a very nice addition for an apartment or maybe an vupstairs vacuum cleaner.",
