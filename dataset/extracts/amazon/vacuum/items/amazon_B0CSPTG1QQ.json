Strong suction, one hand use, easy to read display, adjustable attachments, separate spinning brush for all kind of floors like carpet or hardwood, lights at the bottom of the brush attachment to see where you need to go over, big dust bin which is very easy to clean with 2 replacement filters included, long lasting Lithium Ion rechargeable battery pack with charger, adjustable hose extension made of aluminum and a hook to mount on the wall for secure placement when this wonderful vacuum is not needed. We have cats and after one day of use I can say this vacuum is the best I ever had. It cleans hair so easy and pics up cat food crumbs. I can highly recommend this vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "it is a very impressive upgrade. I have the previous version of this cordless vacuum cleaner. The new brush head becomes much lighter than its predecessor. it is much more comfortable to handle. The light on the brush head also becomes brighter. I love this function. I have Dyson and LG cordless vacuums, but both do not have a light on the brush head.The new touchscreen display shows the suction power level and percentage of the battery. I love a touch button for changing suction power. My home has both hardwood floors and carpet. the new brush head works on both surfaces and sucks the dust not only in front of the brush head but also around the side in the range of 2-3 inches. I am impressed by its improved suction power.In addition, the price of an upgraded vacuum cleaner is reasonable.The battery life is about 25 to 30 minutes when medium and high suction power are used 20% of the time. I hope the manufacturer provides an additional battery.",

Je l'utilise vraiment tous les jours en mode brossette, et un jour sur deux en mode balai et c'est top ! Je recommande.",

Nachdem wir seit einiger Zeit einen anderen Akku-Staubsauger in Verwendung haben und das kabellose Saugen nicht mehr missen m\u00f6chten, sollte ein zweiter Akku-Sauger f\u00fcrs Erdgeschoss her.Der BuTure JR700 macht einen sehr wertigen Eindruck und l\u00e4sst nichts zu W\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig:- Die Saugleistung l\u00e4sst sich in drei Stufen einstellen (siehe Video) - auf maximaler Stufe saugt er besser als unser alter Akku-Staubsauger.- Teppichb\u00fcrste (siehe Foto): Hat nicht jeder Akkusauger, ist f\u00fcr uns aber ein Must-have.- Klar lesbares Display (siehe Foto) mit pr\u00e4ziser Akkustand-Anzeige in % - so erlebt man keinen \u00fcberraschenden Stopp, weil der letzte von drei Balken doch schneller aufgebraucht war als gedacht...- Gro\u00dfe Akku-Kapazit\u00e4t: Der Akku schafft mehrmals die ca. 70m\u00b2.- Der Sauger steht frei: Sehr praktisch, wenn man ihn einfach irgendwo in die Ecke stellen kann und er dann auch einfach stehen bleibt, ohne, dass man was zum Anlehnen suchen muss.- Umfangreiches Zubeh\u00f6r: Alle m\u00f6glichen D\u00fcsen f\u00fcr Polster oder auch das Auto sind dabei.Fazit: Wertiger Sauger mit ordentlicher Leistung, gutem Akku und einigen praktischen Features. Was will man mehr?",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ottimo aspirapolvere , ho acquistato gi\u00e0 un suo predecessore che \u00e8 durato per molto tempo . Questa versione \u00e8 molto migliorata , ha una maggiore potenza di aspirazione fino a 400W , 3 velocit\u00e0 di pulizia , display touch molto semplice e intuitivo e led incorporato sulla spazzola . Come suo fratello quello pi\u00f9 famoso e meno accessibile . La grande novit\u00e0 che pi\u00f9 mi ha colpito , \u00e8 che nn bisogna pi\u00f9 tenere il grilletto premuto . Cosa che suo fratello famoso ,ancora nn ha migliorato . Nel video in allegato ho posizionato a terra polvere relativa ad un altro aspirapolvere , cous cous e farina . Potete vedere che gi\u00e0 alla minima velocit\u00e0 ha adempito pi\u00f9 che egregiamente al suo lavoro . Il display visualizza la percentuale di carica della batteria cos\u00ec da averla sempre sotto controllo e nn rischiare di lasciare il lavoro a met\u00e0 . Alla massima velocit\u00e0 dura pi\u00f9 di 1h e 20 min alla minima nn ho provato ma sicuramente i tempi saranno raddoppiati . La batteria \u00e8 intercambiabile e quindi se ne pu\u00f2 acquistare un altra di scorta . Nella scatola c\u2019\u00e8 il manico telescopico( nn scontato che sia telescopico , perch\u00e9 si pu\u00f2 accorciare e allungare all\u2019occorrenza ) , motore , spazzola led , un puntale per la pulizia degli angoli , una spazzola piccola per divano ecc , due filtri di scorta , cavo e dispositivo per il collegamento a parete della carica . Veramente ben accessoriato , leggero e indispensabile per la pulizia giornaliera . Al momento ne sono entusiasta . Mi riservo ulteriori commenti futuri sulla durabilit\u00e0 della batteria e del dispositivo",

I am pretty happy with it overall, the battery lasts fairly long and the suction is strong enough for a stick vac. The graphite design in red and black looks awesome. The screen led for status and such is also a very neat feature to have. I would recommend this product!",
