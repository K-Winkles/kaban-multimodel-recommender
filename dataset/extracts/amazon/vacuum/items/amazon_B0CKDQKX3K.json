It works very well on sucking up dirt, pet hair, and stains like nobody's business, whether it's on hardwood, tile, or carpet. I have tried them all.The price range seems to be competitive, and you can't go wrong with this reliable device.What's really cool is its battery life \u2013 you can clean for up to 60 minutes in Eco mode before it needs a juice-up, and it only takes 4 hours to get it back to full power. It's really convenient and I'll never go back to those bulky and heavy conventional designs.The LED display has a neat touch, keeping you in the loop on suction mode and battery life, so you're never left hanging mid-clean. Plus, the dust cup is a good size, so you won't be constantly running back and forth to empty it, and it's super easy to do with just the press of a button.This vacuum is lightweight and easy to handle, even if you're just using one hand. And when you're done, you can pop it on the wall mount to keep it out of the way. Oh, and let's not forget about safety :*) the P10's HEPA filtration system makes sure the air in your home stays clean and fresh, which is perfect if you've got allergies or little ones running around.",

                "reviewText": "It's tempting to write something like \"this vacuum cleaner sucks\" but that's what it's supposed to do! It picks up dirt and dust perfectly well. The battery lasts a long time. And it's very lightweight and compact so easy to handle and store. The couple of attachments that come with it are useful and fit well. I'm very glad I got this and find myself using it all the time for all of those little spills and dust bunnies that turn up all too often.",

It's great to clean my car, under my couch cushions and for those little messes that aren't worth dragging out my regular vacuum.It's easy to charge using a USB cord that is included. It's very compact and it fits nicely in my hand unlike my old clunky handheld vacuum. Easy to store as well because of its compact size!",

It charged in a few hours and the first thing that needed vacuuming was the filter on my dehumidifier. It worked great and with the clear dust cup I could see what it picked up. Next was fluff from the bottom of my washing machine\u2026see odd jobs! It is small and powerful enough to get the job done instantly. It has attachments to get in small corners and for fabric. It is described as a car vacuum and I was able to get the crumbs between my seats and in cup holders with ease.",
