                "reviewText": "I have been trying to find a powerful small vacuum for around the house (dust bunnies etc) and car. Yes, this is electric/corded, but doubt you can get this much suction in a cordless. Maybe so, but I have not had any luck with that. This does have a very long cord, which helps! I had a similar vacuum that I purchased years ago that lasted many years and uses. When it finally died, I started my quest to find a similar product. Let me tell you, after trying several different products, I have already ordered another one of these as back-up for if/when this one stops working! That is how much I like it. Lightweight and small with powerful suction----so easy to get to hard-to-reach places.This is not going to easily do an entire floor, mind you, but for those coffee grounds you just spilled or whatever, this is a great tool to have on hand.",

And I was so skeptical because of some of the reviews! But it's perfect for vacuuming up kicked out cat litter! Or pet food the made a mess and fell all around the bowls! I EVEN used it on 2 small fur shaggy carpets I own and it still worked! So the people leaving bad reviews since using it past 2weeks I think they purchased it thinking they were getting a vacuum That'd be perfect for deep cleaning for under 40$. I have only one slight concern qnd it's it still sometimes gives off a plastic smell but it's also super brand new so I'll update later.",

I hand to drill a hole in the wand the size of the existing hole about one-eighth inch closer to the handle for it to click in place. Also, I had to manipulate the click in the white part of the handle outward for it to click properly. Fortunately, I have the tools and ability to do that. Someone else would have sent it back. These are design and manufacturing errors. I bought it to clean area rugs in both bathrooms. Also, I will use it to vacuum floors in the kitchen and entry way. I may use it to vacuum my vehicle, too. It is light and maneuverable in tight places. I tested it on the area rug in one of my bathrooms and it worked well. The suction was good enough to get the job done. I think I am going to like this vacuum cleaner. However, I started out hating it during assembly.",

                "reviewText": "Update 3 months later - changed from 4 stars to 1 star. I am so disappointed as I really liked this vacuum. my problem happened this week when my filter came apart and looks crushed. I searched online and no replacements, I contacted TC-Junesun and they don't tell you where to get replacement filters. I never imagined when I bought it there would not be replacements. Even when you can wash the filter, it can only last so long. I wrote them 3 times and they requested pictures so I sent and they offered me $5. I originally paid $35. Shameful treatment of a person on limited budget.Original Review 5/2021. I just purchased this little money saving vacuum. Living in the desert with a dog in a 300 sq ft mother unit, it works great. The suction is super strong and fantastic and much better than my former swifter vacuum. It also picks up sand well - and I really like the separate hand held unit for doing door and window grills and even in the car carpeting. As I mentioned, I live in a small area so it's perfect for me.My only cons is the bottom cord wrap is at the level of the cord, so you have to loosen when first wrapping. Also when going under the bed or dresser, make sure to go low enough or the on-off switch will turn off just because of positioning. When emptying the dust container I notice it was difficult to get out dog hair out of the top of the plastic part. For me these are minor and workable. Future manufacturing updates could correct these issues.Very satisficed, thank you.",
