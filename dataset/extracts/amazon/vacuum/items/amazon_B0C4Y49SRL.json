This vacuum replaced my Dyson V8 because it stopped working and I could not find a Dyson repair center close to my residence. The BuTure assembled very easy, it transitions and vacuums well on carpeted floors, tile and hardwood. It is quieter than the Dyson, lighter in weight and I like the headlamp to focus on the hard to see areas. The waste container empties effortlessly and the filters are easy to clean. The replaceable batteries keep me up and running between charges. I love the 3 year warranty, Thankfully I haven\u2019t had to use it yet. I highly recommend this vacuum!",

It effortlessly picks up dirt, dust, and debris, leaving my floors and carpets spotless. This is especially impressive considering its compact size and lightweight design.The smart touch screen adds a level of convenience and ease of use. It allows me to toggle between the 3 suction power modes effortlessly, ensuring optimal performance for different cleaning tasks. Additionally, the touch screen displays the battery life, so I never have to worry about it dying unexpectedly.Speaking of the battery, the Buture VC70 comes with a removable battery that can be charged separately, since it\u2019s removable, if you want to save space or just for convenience. The wall mount is also a great addition, as it keeps the vacuum and its accessories organized and easily accessible.The lightweight and maneuverable head make cleaning a breeze. I can easily reach under furniture and into tight corners without straining my back. The vacuum glides smoothly across different surfaces, making the cleaning process quick and efficient.Additional filter is included in the box, and emptying out your dirt container is a 1 second/push of the button job.In conclusion, the Buture Model VC70 cordless vacuum is a top-notch cleaning device. Its powerful suction, smart touch screen, removable battery, wall mount, 3 suction power modes, lightweight design, and maneuverable head make it a must-have for any homeowner. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient vacuum cleaner.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m loving this Buture VC70! The suction power is great and picks up small and large items easily from bare floors and rugs. It maneuvers easily around items and has enough suction to pick up debris at the edges. The light is a game changer for making sure I\u2019ve picked up all of the crumbs from under my table and edges of my cabinetry. The display is easy to see battery power and adjust the suction. I also love that the battery is removable so I can have an extra on hand to tackle bigger/larger projects. The life of one battery is perfect for vacuuming 3 large rooms, light work or 2 at full suction power. I have an older model Buture where the debris canister sits perpendicular to the vacuum shaft, but this one (vc70) sits in line with the shaft and is much easier to maneuver and handle (see video). I\u2019m also amazed that it ships in such a small box; easier to fit box in my trash and less waste!The only downside to this model is that the wall dock does not have integrated/auto charging once you replace it on the dock. This model you have to plug the charger back into the vacuum after redocking in order to recharge.Overall this is an awesome powerhouse vacuum, especially for the price! I will be recommending this brand and product to my friends and family and will buy from this brand in the future myself.",

Ebenso f\u00e4llt die Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung positiv auf, er klingt einfach angenehm und tut nicht in den Ohren weh wie es der Dyson tat. Die Akkuleistung ist topp, ebenso der Automatikmodus und die Bedienung \u00fcber das Touch-Display.
