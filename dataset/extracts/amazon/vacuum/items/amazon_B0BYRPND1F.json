Can the battery last for 45 minutes? The vacuum cleaner will work up to 45 mins on low speed, 20-30 mins on medium speed and 10-15 mins on Max speed. The working time is tested by hand vacuum, working time will also depend on different the floor types.",

Keep in mind, the suction on this one is rated at 24k. You'd think more, the better. Uh, no. Either this has more suction as advertised, or the others are actually rated lower than this one. This does great on hard floors, rugs, and carpets. (At least for the types in my home). It has three levels of suction. Medium is ideal for hard floors and the type of rug I have. I wouldn't do the highest level. The highest level would be better for carpet, but most of the time medium would do just fine. Battery life is pretty good. Charges pretty quick. Maintenance is easy. Assembly is also easy. The tools work great. This product is worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, so I would like to give this vacuum a 4.5 star review but obviously can\u2019t do that. It is a very good vacuum cleaner overall. If you are looking for something lightweight and functional for your hard surface floors. . . This is hands down one of the best and most affordable options. If you want a stick vacuum that can get pet fur off your couch, it\u2019s not bad. Not the best but not the worst either. Same goes for carpet. It\u2019ll work, but a more expensive Dyson or Shark vacuum would work better on a couch or carpet. That being said, my wife and I love this one for all of our hard wood floors. The pros:- LED headlight (love this, can easily see all of the pet fur)- Great swivel on the vacuum head- EASY to release canister for emptying- Three different suction speeds- Easy to clean vacuum head and canister - Multiple attachments for cleaning different surfaces- Very lightweight for a stick vacuum- Relatively quiet- Will lock into and upright position for easy storage/charging- Battery life has been great for us. We can vacuum our kitchen, dining room, living room, hallway, and bathrooms all on one charge while running the vacuum on medium speed setting (I\u2019ve seen mixed reviews on this)- Recharges within an hour or twoCons:- The suction power is good, but not great. Definitely could work for a quick pass over low pile carpet, but it\u2019s not going to be ideal for medium or high pile carpet or for deep vacuuming it- The roller brush wheel doesn\u2019t rotate very well on carpet or on our couches. While you can still use it, it\u2019s just not the best option as I said previously.Overall it\u2019s a very good vacuum for the price!",

                "reviewText": "There is so much I love about this vacuum. It works great on hardwood and carpet, the attachments make it possible to clean basically any surface, it\u2019s super lightweight and it can reach under all of my furniture due to its slim design and ability for the handle to fold completely down without tilting the roller part up. For the price, I don\u2019t think you could get better. My one and only complaint is the battery life. I knew it only lasted 40 minutes max however I was not considering the fact that the battery would run out quicker when being used at higher speeds. I pretty much only use the high or medium speed settings because I have 12 animals so I have a lot of hair and messes and to pick up. It normally dies when I have about 2 rooms of the house left. I did purchase a back up battery so I can keep one charged all the time. If you plan to use it for big jobs or have a large house I recommend doing the same.",

                "reviewText": "JUST RECEIVED AND HAD TO REVIEW.I had a Dyson V8 Animal Stick. I got it years ago (I'm sure there have been improvements since then) but much happier with this.Compared to my Dyson1) STORAGE It Click-locks to stand in place. My dyson I would lean against something and it would slip/wheel away and crash to the ground. This stays put. easy storage in the closet2) BATTERY pack detaches from the unit. Dyson had to be plugged in somewhere - in view (unless you have an outlet IN a closet somewhere). This - the vac and unit is away in the closet and the battery pack (the size of my fist) is plugged in on the counter next to my phone. Also -besides other issues - the battery pack can easily be replaced when the chargeability starts to fail. I just did a quick end of day vac around my 1700 sq foot home - high power - battery lasted fine. Did floors and carpet, picked up dog hair, pieces of un-munched dog bones and random things without issue.3) WEIGHT. I get the Dyson has a powerful motor but this is maybe a third the weight - so much easier to navigate4) MANUVERABILITY zip zip around everything. fits between chairs and side tables - easy to wheely under tables. The vacuum width is narrower, but I don't mind rolling more to be able to fit in hard to reach spaces more.5) SOUND- quieter... enough said6) DIRT CHAMBER - the dyson held more but this is a stick vac, a quick swipe, not my big vac - chamber is more than adequate. easier to take apart - just less piecesI have:Shark robot self emptying vac: perfect to set to vac at night while we sleep, or when I'm cleaning the house it works ahead of me as we go - and I vac behind. Ranch style home - best purchase ever! (I call him Buster Dustless)Bissel clean view corded vacuum: love this for my monthly deep cleaning. Great suction.Bissel Crosswave mop: I loathe mopping - SO happy with this purchase. I use combo white vinegar and lavender cleaner for a clean steak free and fresh smell.And now the FABULETTA Cordless Vacuum Cleaner.For the price paid... I would rather have a couple of these around the house with maybe a battery back up (If I only used this) rather than paying the $$$ for the Dyson V8.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this cordless vacuum cleaner around six months ago (the red version). I thought I'd wait a while before writing a review so I could see how it got on. Firstly, before deciding on this Fabuletta, I spent a good few weeks looking for a decent cordless under \u00a3200 - after reading so many reviews, specs and details decided this was going to be the one. The majority of the house is carpeted, so was concerned about suction power on carpet. I have to say we've not been disappointed.Out of the box, it looks and feels good. I decided to hoover the living room using our cumbersome corded vacuum beforehand to see what this could do. We were shocked at just how much it picked up on it's first test run (and that wasn't even on full power - we've hardly ever needed to use it on full). And it runs pretty quiet too. Amazing.So light and easy to use too - I hated hoovering until we got this. Now I can just grab it and go round every couple of days for a few minutes. Easy to use on the stairs - being cordless, you don't have those issues. With the attachments making the smaller areas easy enough too, and they're so easy to attach and swap with a click switch. Easy to empty out into the bin (another click and open) and cleaning the filter's not as bad as I expectedReally impressed with this - just wish we'd found it sooner (although our dog wouldn't agree - she hates it!).",
