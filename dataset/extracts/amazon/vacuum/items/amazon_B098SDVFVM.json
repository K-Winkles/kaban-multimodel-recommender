                "reviewText": "I had a different Shark handheld vacuum that I used for cleaning up after my kids, but I killed it after a few years. I knew I shouldn't keep it plugged in all the time, but who can remember to unplug it as soon as it's done charging? The suction was great and I loved it, but another thing was the charge would only last 10 minutes at the most.I got rid of that one and started searching for a replacement. I wanted one with powerful suction and with a lithium-ion battery, so I could charge it whenever I want and not have to worry about unplugging it right away.I was hoping to get one around $50, but came across this. It was $149... Way more than I wanted to spend. :( But I got this because it had everything I wanted, plus it's a stick vacuum!Oh my gosh. I've had this vacuum for 2 months now, and every time I use it, I tell my husband how much I love it! It's just that awesome! I use it as a stick vacuum most of the time to clean up after my kids. I can easily get all the food and crumbs they drop under the table and chairs, without moving the chairs! I also use it in the living room to clean up more crumbs from their snacks on the carpet and couch. I still need my upright vacuum (also a Shark) to deep clean the carpets, but this does a pretty amazing job too! I love how it's so light-weight and cordless, so it's perfect for quick cleaning when I don't want to get my big vacuum out. The charge lasts so long too! It has never died on me and I go all over the house with it!But after I bought mine, the price dropped to $119! :( Ugh! But I'm still glad I bought it when I did, because with kids and pets, I really needed it!Update 11/30/2022:I've had this vacuum for almost 6 moths now, and still love it!! It works great and I also use it to clean my mini van. It gets so much tiny dirt from the floorboards that I can't even see! My kids like to use it around the house too. :)",

                "reviewText": "We have 5 large dogs that roam the entire house (including longer haired ones like German shepherds, labs and goldens) + a small animal room with bunnies, Guinea pigs, ferrets, etc. Needless to say, there\u2019s a lot of dirt, hair and bedding everywhere when we go to clean daily. This thing works amazingly. It really picks up all the dirt, sand and dog hair with no issues. The container where it stores all the mess may seem small but it\u2019s enough space to get my living room, hallways, second living room/office space, dining room and kitchen before emptying it. And I\u2019ve never had an issue with it clogging due to pet hair. Only problem I have is the suction part is right in the middle, so if you\u2019re just going over the floor quickly, it won\u2019t get the corners or around round objects good. You\u2019ll have to take it apart to be the smaller handheld portion to get those spaces. And it takes quite a long time to charge so I recommend leaving it plugged in every time you\u2019re not using it. Other than that, it\u2019s definitely worth buying it.",

                "reviewText": "This little vacuum is so easy to maneuver, I feel like it would be a great vacuum for children to use (though, it's pretty tall so unsure they'd actually be able to use it.) I can whip this around the baseboards and corners quickly without tiring my wrist -- I usually turn to this vacuum over my heavier duty stick vacuum, which doesn't fit under as many spaces. I also feel like I bash my other vacuum into furniture/baseboards more often than this, and it's so bulky that I often scratch the walls. This one is so lightweight I don't feel bad swinging it around the room quickly for impromptu cleanups throughout the day. The bin is awkward to empty -- I have two dogs and I have to dig my fingers around in the bin to get their hairballs out, but it has great suction and is super versatile for handling the mass amounts of hair. I also don't like how the charging stand doesn't hide the charging cable. I love the stand, but hate the wire. I don't often review products but I feel like this review may resonate with some potential buyers. It's a little pricey to me (I would have preferred if it as <$80), but I assume the price point is why the suction/quality is so high.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this & had to use it right away! For positives; It is easy to maunuaver, lightweight, and looks nice on stand. It sucked up my dog's hair & dust bunnies pretty well. I do like it has 2 attachments. As for negatives; it takes 6 hours to charge 100% and the battery only lasted me 20 mins! For being a Shark vacuum, the suction isn't impressive and it has terrible battery life! I am debating whether to keep it or not, just based on that. It didn't last me to do my master bed room & master bathroom & they aren't very big. I also wish you could attach the different attachments on the longer tube instead of just attaching them to the little hand held vacuum. I bought it because it was $100 which is a good deal for it.",

Sin embargo, despu\u00e9s de probarla me pareci\u00f3 una gran compra, es sumamente ligera y la bater\u00eda es suficiente para limpiar un departamento peque\u00f1o sin que se acabe la pila. Tiene buen poder de succi\u00f3n, suficiente para mi que tengo un Pomerania que deja pelitos por todos lados. Los accesorios son \u00fatiles y me parece genial que incluya la base, as\u00ed es posible tenerla parada y tambi\u00e9n se pueden acomodar ah\u00ed los accesorios. El color es bonito y es f\u00e1cil vaciar el dep\u00f3sito. Se puede inclinar f\u00e1cilmente y girar, lo que es muy \u00fatil para llegar debajo de los muebles.Ahora, es una buena aspiradora econ\u00f3mica y sirve para su objetivo, pero si buscas algo tipo Dyson esta aspiradora deja que desear, ya que no tiene luz ni rodillo, pero eso no afecta su objetivo, que es aspirar bien.",
