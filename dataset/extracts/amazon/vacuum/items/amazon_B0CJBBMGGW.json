                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I utilized this device on a variety of surfaces, ranging from carpets to hard floors, and it provided an excellent degree of suction force across the board. I was able to simply remove even the most tenacious pet hair and detritus from my floors because of the suction capabilities, which guaranteed that my floors were pristine. A significant contribution to the total efficiency was made by the brushless motor, which maintained a steady and dependable level of cleaning performance. It is my opinion that the fact that this cordless vacuum has a runtime of fifty minutes is a considerable benefit. The fact that I was able to cover a significant region without having to recharge it often was made possible by it. I was able to monitor the remaining runtime and schedule my cleaning sessions appropriately thanks to the LED display that indicated the remaining battery life. This was a great innovation included in the product. When compared to other vacuum cleaners, this function provides an additional degree of convenience that is sometimes ignored. It is my opinion that the fact that this vacuum cleaner has eight different functions makes it more versatile. It is appropriate for a wide variety of cleaning duties because of the many attachments and configurations that it offers, which include the ability to reach tight corners and tackle surfaces that are above the floor. When used for lengthy periods of time, the lightweight structure made it simple to carry and move, which reduced the amount of weariness experienced.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the orange vacuum but received blue & white, so I reached out to the seller. It turned out to be a mistake on Amazon\u2019s part; the color sticker on the box was white rather than orange. They were super easy to communicate with, responded quickly, and I had the orange vacuum at my door 3 days after reaching out. It was very simple to assemble, and I like that it comes with a wall mount to hold the vacuum and accessories it comes with. I just used it to vacuum my tiled living room, kitchen, and hallways, and I was able to get those areas done on medium speed with just the 50-ish percent battery life it came charged with. I really like the light feature on the front of the vacuum which helps me see the dust on the floor. It\u2019s been on the charger for about 30mins and is at 37 percent. I will update this review after I use it on my LVP floors and my rugs.",

It starts on the medium setting, which is mostly sufficient for my needs. Sometimes there are stubborn bits on a rug, so I\u2019ll switch to high, which isn\u2019t always effective, but overall is fine. I\u2019m always amazed at the amount of stuff in the cup. Our cat is a Major contributor, and this thing seems to pick up his fur easily.Every once in a while, the rollers will lift up a small rug, and they will turn off. It\u2019s an easy restart to get over that.I enjoy the portability, and ease of pushing the head under furniture. No report on using the shortened version. I use another portable for those jobs.",

By removing one of the suction tunes, the vacuum becomes a smaller version of itself and can be used to vacuum the stairs, your car, or a small area that is hard to reach. I love that I can vacuum under my couch, under my table and chairs without having to move the furniture. This vacuum lays totally flat and can reach the farthest spot at the back of the sofa you would normally have to rearrange the house to get. This vacuum is very lightweight and easily maneuverable to empty or carry up a flight of stairs.",

                "reviewText": "So, this was my first day using the vacuum cleaner. The product has a look and feel of a good workmanship. I am not sure about the durability, because the plastic is very thin. Very easy to assembly and use. Gets under any furniture. Worked about 20 minutes on the medium power (which was enough to pickup the dust) before the battery was fully discharged. One full charge was enough for my 2 bedroom apartment that is about 750 square feet. A bit bigger surface will need to have a second fully charged battery on hand to have the work completed in one shot. I would recommend to clean the metal and Hepa filters after every use, or at least after every second use, because the dust might get further in and will need washing. By frequent cleaning you will extend between the wash cycle periods.Pros:Very low profile of the cleaning head, only 1.75\", that easy to push under low clearance furniture.Picks up everything from the floating floor and the floorboard tops.The battery can be removed and charged separately.The battery is protected, because the unit will not power on when the battery is discharged.Easy to drop the debris or clean the filters. Light weight.Low noise level for a vacuum cleaner. Extendable main tube.The brush unit can turn 90 degrees by twistingLow price for the work it does.Cons:Very thin plastic that might crack easy if not handled gently.Thin sides on the flat nozzle and there is no place on the unit to attach it when not in use.Fast discharge if used on full power.",
