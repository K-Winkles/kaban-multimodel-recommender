Then went to a cheap one from Walmart but had the same issue with its brush. Started looking for a vac without a brush and found this little guy. It is perfect for what we needed. It's light weight, has good suction, and easy to use. If I had any complaints, it would be that I would like for it to fasten together better. The tubes just slid together and really don't attach very tight. But, overall, I would highly recommend this little guy.",

                "reviewText": "Keeping realistic expectations with the vacuums physical ability is best way to decide if its right for your need! Reality- it\u2019s a Dust Buster!! (Throwback name to the 80\u2019s anyway..!!) Best to snag small spills or debris.. light touch up without use of the heavy artillery! It\u2019s works as a perk to get hard to reach places- BUT, not designed to vacuum a home !! If lucky, this may execute fully in a dorm room or corporate office space.. all dependent on size of space.. and type flooring.NOT best on carpet except for specific spot-picker-upper! It\u2019s solid in tight stair corners, or to grab ceiling cobwebs + clean off ceiling fans.. awesome to get under couch cushions or in a cars crack/crevices, crumbs under barstool counter post bfast.. and dust underneath furniture- hence its name, Dust Buster..!!!Unit surprised me by its suction- especially with its small size motor- I was impressed. Tbh, I discarded all attachments with exception of x2 extender poles.. leaving its end wide open. This keeps debris from simply being pushed around by brush attachment.. or rolling over it! Design truly isn't made to have this type add ons, IMHO! Note: strong enough to carry debris up both extender tubes- ha! even picking up x2 Lego pieces in the process.. to give you idea of strength!Pro/Con of plug: device wont lose power just minutes into job as this stays solid start to finish. Ready when you are.. it can work for a lot longer amount at a time bc endless power. On flip side: cord is shorter then expected.. harder to use in a car- or RV.. must be pulled into garage by power source.Pieces connect with ease.. shimmy into tight fit and release the same way. Clear canister lets you see when it needs to empty. Includes replacement filter.. a nice touch. Fun color to match decor- As one who usually isn\u2019t a fan of dust buster, Im liking the power and extenders-lightweight design all for $35. Hoping info can help you.. stay safe everyone.",

                "reviewText": "So, I know that the price is definitely a good deal and I was a bit worried! Once I received my vacuum cleaner I was very surprised about the strength of the motor is this. I truly don\u2019t care about the other parts that much but as a vacuum cleaner it is a must buy!!! Picks up everything and I mean everything!!! Very powerful and worth every penny. Highly recommended for small apartments or spaces!!!! Best purchase this year!!!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my office at work (which has tile floor). During the fall & winter months, leaves and dirt tend to get tracked inside. We've had a lot of turnover in the custodial staff & the offices just don't get vacuumed/mopped frequently. As I took this out of the box, my thought was \"what did I waste money on?\". The extention pieces don't lock together. It's just a slip-fit. The first time I assembled it, I guess I didn't have it pushed together far enough and it fell apart when I picked it up. The floor piece doesn't have any sort of brush.The cord is quite short. I tested it in my bedroom and I had to change plugs just to get to the opposite wall. For my office it will be fine (it's the size of a walk-in-closet).When I first turned it in, I was very pleasantly surprised by the suction power and disgusted by how much dirt, hair and cat fur it picked up from behind the door (where Roomba never goes).Overall, it's good for my usage & it's compact enough to store in a drawer out of sight. Since it is corded, I don't have to worry about charging it prior to using it (as I don't expect to use it frequently).",
