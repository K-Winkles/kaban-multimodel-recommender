The 36V lithium-ion battery provides up to 30 minutes of cordless cleaning power*, so you can move throughout your home without being tied to an outlet. Its multi-surface cleaning capabilities let you switch from cleaning sealed hard floors to refreshing area rugs in an instant. CrossWave\u00ae Cordless Max multi-surface cleaner also features improved edge cleaning** to clean messes like pet hair along baseboards and in corners. Two-Tank Technology keeps clean and dirty water separate, so unlike mopping, only clean water and formula go on your floor. When you\u2019re finished cleaning, the self-cleaning cycle cleans the brush roll and inside of the machine, so there\u2019s less clean-up after cleaning. It comes with 2 Multi-Surface Trial Formulas, 2 Hard Floor Sanitize Trial Formulas, and 2 Multi-Surface Brush Rolls. It also helps save pets! BISSELL proudly supports BISSELL Pet Foundation\u00ae and its mission to help save homeless pets. When you buy a BISSELL product, you help save pets, too. We\u2019re proud to design products that help make pet messes, odors and pet homelessness disappear. * May vary based on mode and usage.** Compared to CrossWave and CrossWave Pet Pro multi-surface cleaners.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE that this is cordless!! I've never had a cordless vaccuum before, I find myself using it multiple times a week, especially to run under and around the table after kids eat!Easy, sweat free, cleaning: I used to use Swiffer because I hated taking out the mop bucket, but scrubbing floors with a Swiffer was so much work and sweat, so I would only mop maybe once a month, not ideal with 2 kids and 2 dogs.Suction power: Great suction power! Picks up finger nail size rocks and even picks up peas. (I even had to try throwing peas and other food on the floor to test, worked great! Picked it all up!!)Long battery life: I have ~1,000sqft of hardwood in our home and 1 dog that creates fluff balls all over and mop vac picks it up with ease! With it fully charged, I can mop ~3/4 of the 1,000sqft before it needs to be charged again.Easy machine cleaning: I love the self cleaning mode, but you do have to wipe the tray after. The hair trap is awesome so you can wipe out the hair trap and still dump the dirty water down the drain.Small Con: I use hot water to clean the floors but it doesn't easily get caked on food or grime off easily, even if you let the brushed run over for 30 seconds. I typically just run over it to soak and wipe up with a cloth.Conclusion:- I would prefer a longer battery life, but it easily cleans ~800sqft and easy to pop it on the charger, it does charge pretty fast.- Cleaning caked on grime could be better, but nothing a quick cloth swipe or regular cleaning wouldn't fix.- Cordless and very easy machine cleaning.- I am very happy with this product overall!! It took a year to finally buy it, but best purchase I've made in a while!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Better than a Swiffer or Spray Mop, Make Daily Mopping Part of Routine",
                "reviewText": "I'm going to write this review comparing the Crosswave to both a $30 spray mop/swiffer that you can find a million different models of on here, and to a traditional mop and bucket. Summary at the bottom.Cleaning Ability: 4.5/5The crosswave lands somewhere between the mop and bucket, and spray mop for cleaning ability. It does land much closer to the mop and bucket, however, which is the best way to deep clean your floor. What this does do better than the m&b is sanitize. I feel much better cleaning my bathroom with this rather than a mop and bucket that becomes contaminated the second you rinse the mop. Something the Crosswave also does that the others don't is cleaning solid waste. You can clean up a spilled bowl of cereal, for example, with just this one device; vacuuming and mopping simultaneously. I've had some pretty messy spills, dried liquids, food that's fallen and been stomped on, and this has no problem cleaning it up.Ease of Use: 3/5The winner here is clearly the spray mop or swiffer. I would say the mopping itself is extremely easy, but you're only deferring your effort. After use, you'll have to run the cleaning cycle, empty the drain water container, clean out the solid waste from the basket, rinse the filter, and possibly clean the rotating head every few uses with soap and water. I still find this easier than dealing with a mop and bucket, but barely. Just don't expect to be able to grab this, mop up, and then throw it back in the closet having saved so much time and energy.Price: 3/5Well, it's a bit more than a mop and bucket to say the least. I got mine on sale for less than $300, and I'm not sure I could justify spending full price ($411 List Price) on this. But, I don't have any regrets so far. I find myself much more likely to mop daily, and my house has been cleaner since I've bought it.Reliability: -/5This is an unknown, but its already lasted longer than any spray mop I've bought, which seem to fail after 2-4 months. The win here will definitely go to the mop and bucket. I'll update this if anything changes.Maintenance: 4/5Maintenance is pretty easy here. I'll eventually have to replace the filter, but it came with an extra mop head. The mop head seems high quality and should last quite a while. The filter is washable, so I haven't had to worry about that yet. I haven't tried any other cleaners, but you're supposed to use the stuff from the manufacturer, so be prepared to pay more for cleaner than you're used to, but it's pretty reasonably priced.Build Quality: 4.5/5This feels like a high quality product in line with a Dyson or Miele. My only concern is that the charging/cleaning station feels quite cheap. Other than that, I have no worries that this will last a while. The battery lasts plenty long to mop my whole house.Overall: 4/5If you have the money to spend and want to make daily mopping part of your routine, this really does beat the spray mops and swiffers of the world. It's very nice having something I can easily grab after cooking dinner and give the kitchen a once over, mopping and vacuuming at the same time. It certainly beats the mop and bucket for cleaning a localized spill, and can still handle my whole house if it needs to. It won't replace the deep cleaning of a good mop and a bucket of hot, soapy water, but it will get you 90% of the way there, and for me, that's enough to make it worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Ok so here's my review on the Bissell cordless crosswave:Suction: 12/10It picks up everything on the first pass a luxury I didn't realize I was missing with my old vacuumMopping: 8/10It might be because I don't mop very frequently or the multi surface formula I used or a combo of the two, but I feel it left the floors looking dull although they were definitely cleaner just looking at the rollerBattery life: 6/10It lasted 22mins before it died. Maybe it's because I'm still trying to get the hang of mopping and vacuuming at the same time (I started with just vacuuming first then mopping so that took a bit of time). I was only able to get the hallway and our room done.Carpet: ?/10Not sure how I'm feeling about it as I was only able to get the hall carpet which is much thicker than the living room carpet. It was very difficult to move, but that rug doesn't stay put so I may have been struggling more because of thatHard floors: 8/10Like I said I feel it left the floors looking dull but that could be due to other circumstances. It was definitely easy to use thoughCleaning: 10/10It does the job as it should so I really can't complain lolSelf cleaning feature: 9/10I love how well it cleans the roll, but you still have to remove it to dry, but everything seems easy to take apart and put back together.Maneuverability: 5/10Its pretty easy to use, but you can't go under furniture very far as it doesn't bend back far enough so that's a bummer.Toddlers rating: -5/10The noise was scary, it's new and not like the old vacuum that had a fun cord to chew on. I smacked it a few times and chased it, but it just wasn't the same.Overall: 7/10My score will probably go up as I get used to using it. But I'm definitely pleased with it's ability to clean",

It requires you to purchase an additional accessory (not included) to be able to clean carpets, and even with it, it DOES NOT WASH THEM, it just \"refreshes\" them (whatever that is). I paid almost 700 cad for the US version, aiming to own a carpet cleaner that was close to what professional machines do (as it is announced), and it does nothing like that. Nowhere in the description of the product it states that you cannot return this to Amazon, now I am stuck with a 700 cad electrical mop and vacuum. With half that money, I could have bought a vacuum/mop robot, which would do exactly this. It also continuously leaves chunks of wet dirt behind, both when cleaning hardwood floors and rugs, and Amazon will just refer you to the manufacturer (if I had wanted to deal with Bissell, I would have bought it directly in their website for a little less money... the only reason why I bought it from Amazon is precisely as I believed I would be protected by Amazon's policies and service.

I own a large home and the thought of using a vacuum with a cord compared to a cordless was disappointing. I packed it up and had every intention of sending it back but I kept getting the nagging feeling I might get another vacuum with a cord regardless, because I have no control over what happens. It seemed like a rather large hassle with the possibility of a poor outcome so I unpacked it and am now using it.Having said all that I do find it an amazing vacuum. It\u2019s a bit heavier than I thought it would be but it does a fantastic job! I can\u2019t do my stairs because I find it heavy and awkward so I just do my main floor with it and use a smaller lighter vacuum to do the upstairs. Now once a week I\u2019ll haul that sucker upstairs, to wash those floors. I\u2019m not going to spend all that money and not use it but i was hoping the vacuum would be a bit lighter.The cord is long so that helps.I guess at the end of the day it\u2019s certainly not perfect for the price. but it DOES do a good job! So for that I\u2019m thankful.",
