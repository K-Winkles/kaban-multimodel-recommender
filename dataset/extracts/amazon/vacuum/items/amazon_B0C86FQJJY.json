Only problem, when you go to hardwood to carpet you have to switch it over. To me it\u2019s a pain. The cord is a good size. This vacuum is loud.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second purchase of this item. We have a three story house. I bought this one for the downstairs about a year ago and have loved it so much that I'm buying one for upstairs. My dog's shedding has killed FOUR higher-end, cordless uprights in two years. They get clogged quickly, which is a drag on the batteries and they also lose suction. Plus they're a pita to clean because of the way the cup detaches. I always got my hands covered in dust trying to empty them. This one empties clean & easy. No hands required.It is a full-size corded vac, so it's not as sleek and easy to maneuver as the cordless ones we used to have. However, the cord is super long so I'm not constantly having to change plugs.",

It's been really hard on my area carpets.- Its inexpensive.Cons:- It feels like a toy compared to the Bissell vacuums I've owned in the past; I don't expect it to last for too many years.- It has no rubber bumpers to protect furniture and walls. Just hard plastic baby!- It has locking attachments and hose connections that are uniquely sized so you're unable to use off-brand, friction fit attachments. Locking attachments on any vacuum make no sense to me because the very nature of a vacuum holds the pieces together.- The vacuum head has no mid-way locking position so when the head is unlocked with the foot peddle the handle will fall to the ground. It's great for vacuuming under a bed but it makes it difficult to get over the edge of an area rug/carpet. You either have to bend to the ground to get the vacuum head to lift off the floor to get it onto the carpet/rug or pick up the whole vacuum to place it on top. Either way it's good exercise!In the end it's a good vacuum for the price, but I'll most likely go back to Bissell the next time around.",
