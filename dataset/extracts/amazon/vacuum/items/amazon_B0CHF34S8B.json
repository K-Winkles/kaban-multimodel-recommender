                "reviewText": "I love that this vacuum is cordless, which is great, and picks up pretty well when the battery is fully charged. The battery doesn't stay charged for very long, though. Also, if you have heavy shedding dogs like I do, it becomes a little frustrating getting all of the hair picked up in one sweep. Also, there is a design flaw. The filter sits in the middle of the waste compartment, so when you open it to empty into the trash, the dog hair gets stuck on the lip of the filter and you have to try to wedge it out from behind it with your hands. Ick. The price was right, and it is sturdy , it comes with attachments, too. Overall pretty good product.",
