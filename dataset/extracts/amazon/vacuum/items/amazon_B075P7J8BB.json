                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ideal for those who would struggle with a heavy vacuum, and small spaces. Long cord (apx 20 feet)Works on thick carpeting but not as well, as seen in the video. The carpet shown is a thick nap very old 1980's carpet. And the white stuff is that white flocking off a Christmas tree that nearly velcro's itself to the carpet. So the fact it's getting any at all is very impressive. Putting a little weight into it and it works about as well as a full powered vacuum.Ideal for bedrooms, stairs, and slick floors or thin carpets or rugs. It works on heavier carpet but not as well and easily. Still, for the cost, it's doing great!Small so it's also great for if you don't have a large storage space for cleaning supplies.I feel like it's perfect for small daily cleaning. But would still keep a heavy, high powered vacuum too if there's the option for deeper clean needs or larger spaces like a large living room.It swivels well and you get used to it fast.Very simple assembly, 3 main parts and a small plastic piece - the handle and long metal bar are one piece, the vacuum and plug a second, and the brushes attachment on the end the 3rd. There's the handheld attachment and a small plastic piece it attaches to at the end of the metal bar.Only disapointment is there's no suction at all without one of the attachments. It works great for getting underneath things, but I did notice a couple of times that I accidentally bumped the power button doing so.A side facing power button and if possible a mid sized attachment or just being able to use it without attachments would make it absolutely perfect.But for under $40?I feel like this is a great value for the money and has terrific suction for what you've bought.Picked up hair and dust bunnies on hard surface floors or thin carpets the first time.Easy to dump out and clean too. I love that the filter can be washed as well.Thank you to this company! Great Christmas gift for an elderly family member who needed something lighter! I would definitely recommend it as an economical and space saving option!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very happy with this vacuum. I didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend, and my previous vacuums have all broken or blown up in the last month which sucked. I had purchased a dirt devil handheld and it burnt out after one heavy duty vacuuming session I didn\u2019t anticipate. Three weeks of having it. My other one got a giant sock stuck in it and was not able to be reached to come out w out cutting the tubing. It is fall here in New York and it is rainy, muddy, and lots of shredded leaves everywhere. I have been out of my mind being unable to vacuum our apartment all this time. I finally ordered this vacuum yesterday, got it today, and I am already very happy. I used it immediately upon receipt and it was a dream. It rolled over hardwood floors very smoothly and picked up all sorts of crumbs in the kitchen. I used it in the bathroom to vacuum up stray hairs. I used it in my sons room to pick up spilled formula powder on the wood floor, and other dirt on his area rug. I used it in our master bedroom which is carpeted. I was able to clearly see dirt and particles being lifted off of a very low pile carpet. I used it in my living room and it picked up everything perfectly. I have lots of different flooring in my rental apartment. This thing was perfect. Even though it\u2019s basically a handheld dust vac with a floor attachment, I never got the feeling that it was. The suction is very good, such that wherever I put that thing it sucked stuff up, even along the outer areas of the floor attachment. Ok rugs it works best going backward towards you, as it skips along the rug when pushed fwd but I jsut did it nice and slow and I am confident it was picking up dirt and hair. I even used it on a small shag rug. I did not detach the handheld for that option this time, but I fully intend to in the future. Although it was far more comfortable in its full upright mode. And it\u2019s so lightweight and portable I don\u2019t foresee using it as a handheld only very often. my pictures show what it looks like fully upright, up close, and the canister with contents after my very first use of it. I cannot even believe how much crap there was on my floors in just like a week of not vacuuming. I had been sweeping during that time and was grossed out seeing how much was actually on the floors despite that. I love having visuals like seeing the grossness in the canister lol. The bagless canister is convenient, I am used to vacuums like that and I know that they are very easy to clean and the filter is rinsable. I saw some reviews mention the length of the cord. I actually did not really have too much of a problem with that. I could have used it being 5 feet longer or more but Another 2 feet would not have mattered to me at all. Whether it\u2019s 10 feetOr 12ft wouldn\u2019t make or break a vacuum session for me. Our apartment isn\u2019t small but it\u2019s nothing close to a house. I do have a million outlets all over my apartment so it really wasn\u2019t difficult. It swivels nicely and I can totally get it into weird angles and zoom around the floors nicely. I plan to use it on my entryway and the stairs up to my apartment tomorrow. Those are completely destroyed from leaves and all sorts of crap. So far I am very happy with this purchase! Excellent price excellent suction, excellent results.Update 2 weeks later: I use this vaccum about four times a week. I still use it on all sorts of surfaces like carpet, floor, stairs, entry way, play mat, couch, etc. I am still very happy w the suction and effectiveness of the vacuum. As I\u2019ve used it more and more there are some annoyances that\u2019s rent major but certainly worth mentioning: 1) the feature of just using it as a hand vac is impractical in my opinion. If I am vacuuming and decide I want to spot clean something w the hand vac option it is very cumbersome to achieve. Between the long handle piece and trying to yank out the floor attachment it ends up being far mor effort than is necessary when I jsut end up using the floor attachment on whatever. If I am going to use the hand vac alone it is from the beginning, not during a routine vacuuming. So I\u2019d recommend doing it that way in general. 2) the swivel feature is fantastic but sometimes causes twisting and tangling of the cord around the lower part of the vacuum. Also if you want to lift the vacuum to move it while vacuuming it can often spin and you\u2019re like twisting the whole thing around to get it back in line w itself. 3) the power switch being on the hand vac and fairly low down is a pain. I know there\u2019s really no other way to do it but it is a little annoying. Otherwise though I am super happy w this purchase especially for the price. It is perfect for an apartment, or as a basement vacuum or for other smaller spaces that you don\u2019t want to lug a giant heavy vacuum. I did clean the filter and canister once and it was very easy. The filter dried by the window in about two hours. I still love it and totally recommend it.UPDATE 2/12 months later**** still loving it. I use it about every other day. I\u2019ve cleaned the filter many times no issues. Suction still seems good. It\u2019s been picking up small Christmas tree pine needles perfectly. It does not like hair embedded into carpet, even low pile. I had a baby a few months ago and my hair is starting to shed horribly now. I get insane about stepping on hair so I vacuum a lot. But I thought it was picking up hair on the rug in our living room and just for sh*ts and giggles I took tape and used it on the rug to see, and basically every hair I\u2019ve ever shed was still in the carpet. Hardwood floor? Yes no problem but carpets no. At least now I know lol. Otherwise it\u2019s just a simple and generally effective little vacuum. Still recommend",

Tje cleaning staff leaves a lot to be desired so I manage my own office. I like it vacuumed and dusted daily. It was very inexpensive and helps me get the job done in minutes. It's lightweight and not bulky. I bought one for my daughter when she went to college for her room. She loves it too.",

                "reviewText": "Hasta ahora todo bien, cumple su funci\u00f3n, aspira bien y su precio es accesible, ya que otras aspiradoras eran mucho m\u00e1s caras, esta es suficiente para lo que la necesito, que es es aspirar los pelos de perro de mis mascotas del piso y polvo. En los sillones tambi\u00e9n funciona pero hay que pasarla m\u00e1s veces porque no tiene tanta succi\u00f3n en ese tipo de superficie ya que luego los pelitos se quedan como incrustados en la tela y es un poco m\u00e1s tardado retirarlos.El deposito de la aspiradora no es muy grande, para aspirar toda la casa tengo que vaciarlo un par de veces, pero no es algo que tome mucho tiempo, es f\u00e1cil de utilizarla y ligera. La recomiendo.",

                "reviewText": "Me lleg\u00f3 relativamente hace poco y apenas la he podido usar en 2 ocasiones pero desde la primera vez que la us\u00e9 qued\u00e9 fascinada con lo f\u00e1cil y r\u00e1pido que es limpiar con ella.La compr\u00e9 porque tengo un gato y la cantidad de pelo que tira es much\u00edsima y ya hab\u00eda escuchado y le\u00eddo muy buenos comentarios sobre esta marca y en especial este modelo y otro m\u00e1s.No me decepcion\u00f3 para nada, es liviana, la puedes usar de 3 maneras diferentes ya que trae accesorios tanto para usarla para aspirar pisos como espacio m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y estrechos. Principalmente sirve para suelos duros, pero la us\u00e9 para aspirar telas y funciona bien. Incluye un solo filtro que es completamente lavable y muy f\u00e1cil de quitar/poner, y un cable de muy buen grosor y tama\u00f1o.Recomendaci\u00f3n: al terminar de usarla, hay que retirar toda la basura que aspir\u00f3 y lavar el filtro con agua y de manera delicada para que no se da\u00f1e la tela, dejar secar y volver a poner. Los repuestos los venden en amazon y no son tan caros.Importante saber que la aspiradora NO es para aspirar l\u00edquidos, as\u00ed que hay que tener cuidado con eso.",

Realmente este modelo no tiene garant\u00eda...De ah\u00ed en m\u00e1s, sigue funcionando al 100 y tambi\u00e9n la puedes usar para aspirar la cama o tapetes y lo hace bien :)",
