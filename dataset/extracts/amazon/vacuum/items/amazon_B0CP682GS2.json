                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the VACLAB Corded Stick Vacuum and I am absolutely thrilled with this product. This lightweight and powerful vacuum cleaner has exceeded all my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a convenient and efficient cleaning solution.First and foremost, the suction power of this vacuum is outstanding. With a powerful 650W motor, it effortlessly picks up dirt, debris, and pet hair from my hard floors. The 19KPa suction power ensures a thorough and deep clean, leaving my floors looking spotless.The lightweight design of this vacuum is a game-changer. Weighing only 1.9 pounds, it is incredibly easy to maneuver and carry around the house. I can effortlessly clean every corner and crevice without straining my arm or back. It's perfect for quick cleanups and makes the task of vacuuming much less of a chore.The 3-in-1 functionality of this vacuum is a fantastic feature. It can be used as a stick vacuum for larger areas, a handheld vacuum for stairs and upholstery, and a crevice tool for hard-to-reach places. This versatility allows me to tackle a variety of cleaning tasks with just one device, saving me time and effort.The 1.9Lb dust cup capacity is impressive for a vacuum of this size. It holds a decent amount of dirt and debris, reducing the frequency of emptying. The dust cup is also easy to remove and clean, ensuring hygienic use every time.I appreciate the thoughtful design features of this vacuum, such as the swivel steering and the LED lights. The swivel steering allows for easy navigation around furniture and obstacles, while the LED lights illuminate dark corners and under furniture, ensuring that no dirt or debris is left behind.Overall, I can't recommend the VACLAB Corded Stick Vacuum enough. It combines powerful suction, lightweight design, and convenient features to provide an exceptional cleaning experience. Whether you have pets, hard floors, or just need a quick cleanup solution, this vacuum is a top-notch choice. I give it a well-deserved 5-star rating!",

Kids are also happy and excited to use it as it does not require force and effort. I also will be using it for my home office as it can reach small spaces and hard-to-reach areas.

                "reviewText": "If I had known the cord was so short a cordless option would have been chosen. The wattage was what made me go with this and I must say the suction is good. The cord is so short that one must change outlets in a 12 by 11 room. It also gets very hot which leads me to believe it won't last long. If it dies soon, I will add to the review.If you don't mind using an extension cord and that it gets hot, then order away because it does suck.",

                "reviewText": "Overal, this vaccine is light weight will a powerful and rechargeble battery. It is a completely coreless design! However, if you have a need of heavy use of vaccine cleaner(more than an hour each time), I recommend do not consider any coreless vaccine cleaners. This product is more friendly to the light use or daily use users.Its battry takes up to 2 hrs to be fully charged and due to the high suction power, it drains pretty quick(about an hour or two). But it is sufficent to most of normal daily uses.Another factor makes me follow in love with this vaccine is that, it is designed to be washable and you can easily disassemble and wash it. (You can get some ideas by look at my first picture psoted. I basicly disassemble all parts of the vaccine.)Lastly, as show in the last picture, it has lights in fron of the vaccine head. It makes my life so much easier to do vaccine under my bed and dark corners.Designers of this product are genius in my oppion!",

                "reviewText": "I'm in love with this cordless vacuum! I also owned a Dyson v7 for many years. Both vacuums are similar in build quality, battery performance, and maneuverability, but the MXY vacuum is a little lighter and delivers better cleaning performance on the carpet and sofa. It took me about three and a half hours to charge it fully. The assembly of the vacuum parts is straightforward. There are two modes of motor: turbo and regular. I prefer turbo on the sofa, and the regular mode makes it less likely to get caught on dense carpeting. Cleaning is easy; you can wash the filter and reuse it. It also comes with two additional filters. Last comparison on pricing: much lower price for a wireless vacuum than the Dyson models. It delivers similar results to my daily house cleaning chores.",
