                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This well-made cordless vacuum is easy to assemble with its snap-on design. It feels balanced and comfortable to use, and the built-in LED light helps illuminate dark corners. The charging dock makes it convenient to charge without searching for the cord, and the digital battery level indicator keeps you informed. With a noise level of around 55dB in normal mode and mid 70dB in high power mode, it's relatively quiet for a vacuum. Emptying and cleaning the dust bin is easy - just rinse it with water after emptying. Suction power is good and included attachments help other house cleaning works. I do wish the base has a place to hold the small cleaning tool and offers optional USB charging for charge in the vehicle. Overall, this vacuum offers a convenient and user-friendly cleaning experience.I hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This vacuum is a very small compact handheld battery powered vacuum. It comes with attachments for corners, a floor brush, and a rotating head brush.You can use it as a standard vacuum, or take off the extensions and use it like a dust devil.The floor roller has LED lights, and it feels natural in my hand. You turn the roller with a slight turn of the wrist.Where this works best is on stairs. It is small enough to easily handle the tight corners.It is not as powerful as a plug in vacuum, but it works great for an rv or a boat. It lasts about 30 minutes on low, and much less on high power. Usually you only need low power for most cleaning jobs.Finally it has a nice wall mount you can store it on if you want.Overall it's a good little vacuum for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First off, one of the coolest features is the charging dock. All you have to do is choose a spot near an outlet and thats all. Literally after every use, just hang it on the mount and it will be charged and ready to go for the next use. No more wondering if you have a charged battery or if you forgot to plug it in. I love it.We have a household with 4 animals/pets (2 dogs + 2 cats). This means A LOT of pet hair and anything/everything the dogs bring in from outside. This vacuum handles all of that with ease. Not only did it handle the ENTIRE floor of the house in one charge, I only had it on the medium power. My animals were afraid of the old vacuum, but this one is much quieter. For some reason they're more intrigued than afraid.You can easily switch power modes via the large touch screen near the handle. It tells you the modes as well as the remaining battery. The only time I stopped was to empty all the hair/dirt that it was picking up. That was convenient as well. It's as easy as pushing a button to flip the dirt bin, the dirt falls into the trash, close the lid, and continue vacuuming.Three of my favorite features:1. The on/off function. You can do all of this cleaning with ONE hand. Pull the trigger once to turn it on, and pull the trigger again for off.2. The LED lights on the vacuum are awesome. I didn't know how much hair/debris I was missing until these lights were BEAMING onto the floor. I can easily clean my house in the DARK. It's almost fun seeing all the areas you've missed before just because the area wasn't getting enough light.3. The adjustable height of the Vacuum. I am 6'4 and my wife is much shorter. I never liked hunching down with the older vacuum, and now that won't be an issue for either of us anymore.We're excited to beable to use the accesories to get into the harder the reach areas like the furniture and even in our vehicles.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the BuTure vacuum cleaner, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and value for money. As someone who is meticulous about keeping a clean home, I have tried various vacuum cleaners over the years, and the Buture stands out as a remarkable choice in its price range.Design and Build Quality:The vacuum cleaner boasts a sleek and modern design, and its build quality is surprisingly robust for its price. The materials used are metal, feel durable, and the overall construction gives off a sense of reliability. The compact design makes storage a breeze, and the lightweight nature of the vacuum adds to its user-friendly appeal.Powerful Suction:One of the standout features of the ButTure is its powerful suction capability. It effortlessly picks up dirt, dust, and pet hair from various surfaces, including carpets, hardwood floors, and tiles. The adjustable suction settings allow for versatility, ensuring that delicate surfaces are treated with care while still delivering the power needed for deep cleaning.Efficient Filtration System:Equipped with a HEPA filtration system, the BuTure effectively captures and traps allergens, providing a cleaner and healthier environment. This feature is especially valuable for households with pets or individuals prone to allergies.Versatile Attachments:The vacuum comes with a set of versatile attachments that make it easy to clean hard-to-reach areas and different surfaces. The crevice tool and electric floor brush have proven to be indispensable for tackling various cleaning tasks around the house.Easy Maneuverability:Thanks to its swivel steering and smooth-gliding wheels, maneuvering the BuTure is a breeze. It effortlessly navigates around furniture and other obstacles, reducing the time and effort required for a thorough cleaning session.Large Dustbin Capacity:The generous dustbin capacity means less frequent emptying, allowing for more uninterrupted cleaning sessions. The transparent design of the dustbin also makes it easy to monitor when it's time for disposal.Noise Level:While not completely silent, the BuTure operates at a reasonable noise level. It's not overly disruptive, making it suitable for use during any time of the day without causing a disturbance.In conclusion, the BuTure is an outstanding vacuum cleaner that offers exceptional cleaning power and value for its mid range price tag. Its combination of powerful suction, efficient filtration, versatile attachments, and user-friendly design make it a top contender in its category. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of an affordable yet high-performing vacuum cleaner for their home.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve used a few brand\u2019s vacumn from Amazon and this vacumn is number 1. I purchased a vacumn from Buture last year and liked it a lot and this is my 2nd vacumn purchase from Buture and love it!!It is light weighted and got 3 suction levels and I love that bin is wider round shape as it is easier to dump the dirt out. It is a little smaller and lighter compare to my other vacuum so for me, love the size and the weight especially when I need to clean my whole house. Battery lasts long enough to clean my 3 bedroom home and suction is strong compare to my big size vacumn. Recommend 100% with the confidence if you are looking to purchase a cordless vacumn from Amazon.",
