                "reviewText": "I've had this for a year. I decided to buy a cheap basic vac after going through several higher end models very quickly. This vacuum reminds me of something my parents would have bought in the 70s-80s which is capable of outliving everything. It's basic, no frills. It's heavy. It's heavy duty. It uses disposable bags. It has good suction. It handles my long hair and dog hair. It has put some muscles on my arms. I've had zero issues.The hose is super short so this isn't great as a detail vacuum for ceilings or high places. It works fine for corners and furniture, just slightly annoying to move around. Probably not a good pick for anyone elderly. Looks like it comes with an extendable wand now though so that might make a difference (mine doesn't have one).Only real con is that it doesn't do great at getting dog hair off my couch. The suction for the hose is so much that it sucks the fabric right up and makes it too hard to move around. The pet hair attachment doesn't do it for dog hair at all.It's still a great sturdy simple vacuum, even if I have to brush the dog hair on the couch into a little pile so I can get it with the hose.",

                "reviewText": "Great motor. This is the most powerful vacuum I've ever owned, but I would not buy it again for two reasons.It is way too heavy, despite its claim of being \"lightweight\", to the point that no one wants to use it. We instantly go for the crappy, battery powered lightweight vacuum instead.Next, when ordering, I had filtered all vacuum cleaners on Amazon until I got to this one. The most important feature I checked was a retractable cord. Somehow, this model appeared in my search results, despite its not having a retractable cord, and I didn't catch it until I had put it together. I won't make that mistake again, but I'm adding it here in the event the filter isn't fixed before someone else lands in the same position. The cord is very long, which is great, but I never want to wind up another super-long cord again.",

                "reviewText": "I've always been a Hoover person, I've had 4 in 41 years & loved them. However, the company was sold a few years ago & I've seen the quality go downhill terribly. I've been looking for a new upright because my house has mostly wall-to-wall carpet & I prefer that over the canister. I have a JRT that sheds a lot & needed something with great suction. After 4 months of doing research, I decided on this Kenmore. I waited a month to write a review because I wanted to use it several times to give a fair review. I love this vacuum! I live in a one-story home so I don't have steps to deal with. It isn't hard for me to maneuver around at all & the suction is wonderful. I've used the Pet Handi-Mate tool on my sofa, it's a tweed type material so the hair gets embedded in it. I used it in a circular motion & found that it did a great job pulling the hair out. Yes, it took some work because of the type of material but it worked great. I love that the bags are of a fabric material & really holds the dirt & dust in without blowing it back out like my Hoover had been doing. There is no smell when running it. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase & would recommend the Kenmore Floorcare Upright Bagged Vacuum, Blue/Silver.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a much more expensive Dyson made for pets, and of all the vacuums I've owned, this is the best vacuum. Leaves lines in the carpet just like the old Kirby my mom had when I was young. I was always having to clean hair out of the roller on my old vacuums, but not this vacuum. It sucks it right up, and because it's bagged (Dyson was bagless), I need to empty less. In fact, I've had it for a few months and don't think the bag is even half full yet. I also love that you can run the vacuum without the roller moving which is perfect for cleaning up loose cat litter on the tile floor. The only downside going from my old Dyson to this vacuum is the Dyson is quicker/easier to change over to hand tools in my opinion, because you have to bend over to free the hose on this vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years, i've used cheap Sharks, a Bissel, a Miele, a SEBO and this Kenmore 31140 has to be the most powerful vacuum I've ever used. You can genuinely feel the power in your hand as you use it and the carpet actually *feels* clean after I've used this unit due to how powerful it is.Our house has tons of carpet, so to make it easier we have 2 vacuums (one for each floor). For the main level and stairs we have a SEBO E3 canister and on the second floor we have this Kenmore and without a doubt I can say this Kenmore is more powerful than the SEBO by far. I even did an experiment where I bought an adapter to be able to plug in a SEBO handheld air powered turbo brush to this Kenmore and that tool was louder when plugged into this Kenmore than it was on the SEBO, meaning this Kenmore was producing more airflow to spin the turbine faster than the SEBO could despite that vacuum costing over twice as much as this. On the Kenmore, the suction power remains consistent as the bag fills as well.We have an issue with a lot of long human hair on the carpet and not that much gets caught in the brush roll. In fact, whatever hair does get caught around the brush roll, comes off incredibly easily. In the past i've had Sharks where it would seem that not a single strand of long hair would make it into the dust bin as all of it would be bound around the brush roll, not the case with this Kenmore though.Despite this unit being powerful, its actually not too loud at all. There is no high pitched shrill you hear on cheap vacuums making it easy to bear. I really love that it has an LED headlight, not sure why these are absent on so many models nowadays.Contrary to what many reviewers say, despite it coming in at around 18 pounds, the vacuum is INCREDIBLY easy to push back and fourth. It rolls very smoothly. I've used a Shark Professional model in the past which physically was lighter than this Kenmore and within a few back and fourth passes, my ENTIRE arm would begin to hurt. This Kenmore despite weighing more than the Shark, never once gives me that feeling in my arm.The worst part about this vacuum, is the Pet Handimate. When you initially plug in the tool and start the vacuum, it is incredibly loud giving the impression that it means business...but upon putting it on relatively low piled carpet it slows down to the point of it becoming borderline useless. What I do instead is use the SEBO handheld air powered turbo brush from my E3 canister by using a reducer adapter so that it fits on the hose of this Kenmore and that works beautifully...better than on the SEBO actually.Another thing which may be worrisome for other people is the overall hose length. It's relatively short but not an issue for us.Beyond that, this unit is fantastic and I'm almost tempted to sell the SEBO E3 and purchase another one of these for the main floor and stairs.",
