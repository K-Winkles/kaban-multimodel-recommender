I vacuumed thoroughly with my canister vac yesterday took about 3 hours on my hands and knees vacuuming because the wand doesn't do a really good job. So the wind tunnel arrived today and I decided I would vacuum the whole floor which I thought was very clean first picture is the canister completely full after cleaning and 8x10 carpet. second picture is the pile of hair that came out of it I then picked it up through it away by the way I wear a size 7 shoe That's my shoe next to it. The dirt that was left on the floor on the third picture I re vacuumed one swipe across that pile fourth picture that is how clean it got it I cleaned of course a few more swipes after taking the picture so that to make sure that I got it all the dirt that I just poured on the floor I am amazed. I don't normally recommend anything or say this much about a product but I am so impressed you have to try this thing I am very glad I purchased this I would purchase it again knowing this. It is a little heavy but I think if I raise the level up maybe it will be easier to push I thought my carpet was low level but I think maybe I need to go to a three on the setting instead of the two low floor carpet.All in all I love this machine It is the best investment I have made. I was even thinking about taking over to my mother's house and vacuuming her carpet She has a whole living room full of carpet. But I think I would have to change the canister lots!",

                "reviewText": "Our vacuum died so we recently bought a high rated \"stick type\" vacuum listed here on Amazon. Turned out to be basically a quick clean up tool with little suction. So we also just bought this unit (had a similar Hoover previously). Has a wide 13' cleaning head with five level adjustments. Extra long cord. Five minutes to put together. Great suction and deep cleaning power based on the dirt/hair/etc picked up after cleaning with the stick. Has extension hose and crevice tools. Its a little heavy to maneuver but for $98, a great value. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after using a cheap $40 Bissell vacuum for a few years, and boy what a difference. I was hesitant to spend such a large amount of money on a vacuum cleaner, but it was definitely worth it.The assembly is easy, just keep in mind that you do need a screwdriver to secure the handle.It's not super heavy, but not super light either. I don't think an elderly person would be able to carry it up stairs.The hose is a decent length - it stretches.The suction is great! I have 4 cats and this vacuum does a wonderful job of picking up pet hair. What I also REALLY like is that it doesn't fling cat litter or other small pieces of debris (sand, dirt, etc) all over. With my old vacuum, I could feel the pieces of cat litter being flung out underneath it and hitting my feet lolThe only 2 things I don't like is that 1) It's SUPER loud and 2) You need a screwdriver to take apart the canister if you want to do a thorough cleaning job. There is an easily accessible filter on the top, which you can remove and wash, but if you want to be more thorough and clean out the entire canister, you need to unscrew it. I haven't done it yet, admittedly.",

                "reviewText": "The last time I purchased a vacuum cleaner was 10 years ago! It's always a Hoover, since \"Consumer Reports\" has repeatedly rated them #1 and through the years. I have always had bagged ones, so this is my first bag-less , bag-free version!PRO:The SUCTION / pick up power is 1000% spot on (pun intended); like other reviews have said, this vacuum picks up an amazing amount of everything and that has been in the carpet for a while. Unlike other vacuums, that don't go that deep or have as much pick up power!I love that this has a traditional and ERGONOMICALLY correct located STEP LEVER, on the backside, to release where the handle and head lock / unlock. It's simple, with less fancy mechanisms to fail or break! (I tried a fancier \"Hoover\" vacuum, with a motherboard on its underside plus wiring for automatic floor leveling; the swivel head was connected with a piece of clear vinyl - plastic hose. What a high failure rate those have; (1) The hoses get holes in them. (2) There is NO step lever (have to walk to the front of the head and push / snap downward to release). (3) The electronic wires pull out / disconnect. (4) The motherboard fails and with just too much tumbling around in an unstable shipping box, then NOTHING works on the vacuum!)-The CORD is medium length, not short or ultra long; it's a hand wind type, without any automatic retraction.-The dirt holding CUP is large and I don't expect to have to empty it, but 1 out of 5 times the vacuum is used.-Saving the BEST for last... CHERRY RED is the color and that I LOVE, so it may make vacuuming less of a chore and more enjoyable!!!",
