Make sure every component is well-installed; a proper-sealed system ensures the vacuum's decent performance. Empty dust cup and clean filters, doing a general clean-ing help the hardwood floor vacuum work properly. Keeping the filter clean helps improve filtration efficiency. You can rinse a Metal or plastic filter, and can gently knock a paper or fabric one to shake off clinging debris. If the stick vacuum cleaner cordless does not work well, check and clean it if there is any blockage in the tube, brush roll, and filt-ers.",

                "reviewText": "I am amazed at the high quality and all the features this stick vacuum has. I looked at a lot of vacuums before deciding on this one. I am very satisfied with everything about this vacuum, from the color and looks of it, the 26000Pa strong suction and 350 watt brushless motor, the three stage filtration system and attachments included, and how well it handles and performs. It is actually fun to use and I now I don't need to use a broom and dust pan anymore! The cleaning possibilities are endless with all the included attachments and the cordless freedom! I opted for the kit that also has the hose attachment which I feel gives me so much more flexability when cleaning using the crevace and brush attachments. There are three levels of filtration which include a Hepa filter, a foam particle filter and a stainless steel honycomb filter. I was really surprised at all the dirt and dust this vacuum picks up and is collected in the filter system. I mainly use this vacuum on my hard floors although it seems like it will also clean carpets too. Having a cat there are always litter particles and hair on the floors which this vacuum picks up perfectly. There are two speeds which both seem powerful enough to pick up debris but I splurge and mainly use the higher speed. I also like having the light on the main roller section which really helps me see the dirt and debris on the floor especially if the room light is turned off. The large wheels on the vacuum roller section are heavy duty with great traction on them and the move smoothly. This vacuum is lightweight even though it looks and is heavy duty. I also like the roller section locking in the upward position when needed especially when storing the vacuum or lifting it up and moving it to another area. I have a cheaper stick vacuum that does not have this feature and the base just dangles which I don't like. I can tell there was a lot of research and development that went into designing this vacuum and it really shows in it's features and how well it functions and handles. The charging cord plugs into the battery on the vacuum which I really like instead of it plugging into the storage base like my cheaper one does. When it is charging there are lit flashing blue arrows that show it charging and once it is fully charged all the arrows are lit solid blue. There is even a spare Hepa and foam filter included and a great user manual. As with all electronics I purchase on Amazon I also purchased a three year protection plan with Asurion which I recommend to others. This is an awesome cordless vacuum that I highly recommend to everyone else.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical, thinking this vacuum wouldn't be enough power for our pet hair or wouldn't be very functional, but I was wrong. It has been such a quality of life improvement (as strange as that may sound). No more sweeping with a broom and kicking up dust, and no more lugging around a heavy, awkward, corded vacuum and plugging/unplugging it room to room.We have two cats, one of whom sheds tufts of hair constantly, and this vacuum picks it all up - even on the low power setting (I never even need to use it on high, which is good because that's much more of a battery drain).I use the vacuum every day. When it's just quick daily clean up, a battery charge lasts 2 or 3 days/uses. When it's a more thorough weekly cleaning, upstairs and downstairs, then I just barely have enough charge to finish the entire house, which is why some people end up getting a second battery. But for its effective suction, light weight mobility, lack of annoying cord, maneuverability, and ease of emptying, it's more than worth the price of the unit and a second battery (if you need one).I also love that it has multiple filters including a HEPA filter, and the various attachments work great and are really easy to attach/detach. The front light is quite helpful, too.It literally felt like our house smelled and felt cleaner after we started using this vacuum. It's actually fun to use and no hassle...I just turn on a podcast and swivel around the house with it. Definitely recommend!",

I love the fact that this is cordless as my old vacuum cord and oxygen cord constantly entwined and I had to stop continually to sort out. The vacuum is extremely light and maneuverability is outstanding. The vacuum is easy to put together with clear instructions/illustrations. I had vacuumed about eight hours earlier with my old vacuum before testing this one and did not expect the results I received. First of all, it\u2019s extremely quiet and I was afraid the suction wasn\u2019t very strong. I was shocked, the dust collector was completely full. This vacuum not only cleaned up cat fur and litter left behind by my old vacuum but completed the task quickly and quietly. Five stars, what a wonderful invention. It\u2019s also easier to store when not in use.",
