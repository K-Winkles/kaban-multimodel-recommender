                "reviewText": "Dirt Devil Express Light Stick vacuum is a keeper!A great lightweight utility or spot vacuum usage. It can't be beat. Can be used as a hand vacuum or floor vacuum that actually has working rollers. Common Sense design (with excellent functionality) and easy to set up and use.I have a big old school Kirby upright vacuum that is great as my primary vacuum, yet hard to get around nooks and crannies work for simple spot cleaning or cleaning for one or two rooms quickly.Recently my 100% indoor cat somehow got fleas... and I wanted a separate vacuum to do daily vacuuming (+ baking soda) treatments.Although the vet treated the cat successfully, I still needed to SAFELY break the cycle of frea eggs growing to mature adult fleas in the carpets and furniture. Look up flea treatment for carpets on YTube for details.The Dirt Devil was perfect for this. I could easily \"clean the dirt out of the after each use\". My primary upright (old school Kirby) bag vacuum would have cost me $$$$ in additional replacement bags. Converting to the hand vacuming option easily allowed me to vacuum the upholstery and other chairs that the house.I will update this review in case there's any more to add overall. So far things are great Thanks to the Dirt Devil Power Express.GENERAL (common sense) TIPS:\u2022 CLEAN the rollers from time to time, especially in the corners where any vacuum rollers would eventually bind up.\u2022 EMPTY & CLEAN it after every use.\u2022 I'm not sure of the duty cycle, yet limit your usage to 15 minutes at a time and you won't put a strain on the motor.PROS:\u2022 Lightweight & easy to maneuver under furniture.\u2022 Great bang for the buck!\u2022 Rollers are decent (be sure to clean rollers).\u2022 Has a clear top roller base so as to see and monitor the rollers in use.\u2022 Quieter than a full-sized vacuum.\u2022 Cord length is average (it's quite Ok).\u2022 Will stand up in closet, or hang up with attached hanger hook.\u2022 Great way to teach children and grandchildren (when old enough) how to clean the house, buy them their own.\u2022 Great for older individuals who require a very lightweight utility vacuum for typical cleanups around the house.CONS:None if you use it as a lightweight utility vacuum.PLEASE NOTE:For comparison's sake, it's not a $600+ Dyson vacuum... that actually COSTS OVER 12 times as much as the Dirt Devil Power Express \"Lite\" stick vacuum.Some reviewers complain about the noise, cord length, roller base does not lock when vacuuming or the rollers stop working (if you don't clean them occasionally). REALLY? Vacuums are not hard to maintain, yet easy to abuse if you neglect them... IMHO.",

                "reviewText": "THIS IS PERFECT VACUUM FOR:= Prefect for Elderly person who has problem with lifting and pushing heavy vacuums.I got it for my elderly neighbor who is super sweet and kind and she always struggles with her old upward big heavy and noisy vacuum cleaner. She was moved to tears by the gift after she used it for the first time. She said this is exactly what she was looking for and did not k now how to find it.It is very light but it does great job picking up things. It has motorized roller brush so that is the whole difference between the other light small vacuums that are junk because you still have to push them hard to move about. This puppy runs itself and you only control where it goes. Picks up dirt wonderfully.= It is perfect for anyone who is WEAK or ILL or otherwise does not have strength to operate heavy vacuum cleaners.Again, the magic is in the motorized roller that propels this thing so you only help a little to direct where do you want it to go. Also because it is SO SUPER LIGHT, like a feather that you really don't need to strain your heart or muscles or skeletal system to make it go.= It is perfect for young kids some 8 plus who can already help around the house and are ready to move on from a little kids broom to serious tool but are not quite into the management of a big and powerful vacuum cleaner. It is so much fun to work it and see the clean room behind.= It would be prefect for anyone who has a small space and need a quick and easy pick up tool now and then.So here is my bottom line..DEFINITE PROS:- It is feather light- It can do great job on hardwood and carpet- it is easy to clean as all you have to do is open and empty little container, just shake it off into the trash.- it is two in one, just as it is a stick vacuum it is also a hand held vacuum, you just detach the hand and you have a handy small hand held vacuum.- the brush is motorized which is not only easy to maneuver as it propels the vacuum but also does great job picking up stuff from the carpets and hard wood floors and anything in-between.- does great job with pet hair but you will have to clean the roll now and then with scizors to cut out the hair that will roll on it but unless you have bug bucks vaccum every vacuum has the same issue.CONS:- If you consider the job it is meant for then there are no really any cons.- It is NOT designed for big mess or very dirty carpets as it won't penetrate the carpet as deep as the huge vacuum with huge suction power but for normal day to day carpet dirt pickup it is perfect.- it fills out after few days so you need to shake out the little compartment but not a big problem just one click.Overall it is PERFECT light feather vacuum that is ideal for anyone, a handy work horse modern broom really.",

I even used it out on my deck rug, with all the leaves and pine needles. The only down fall is you have to clean out the cup after every use as it is small. But still big enough to get the job done. I may even plan on getting one for my house and throw away the broom.",
