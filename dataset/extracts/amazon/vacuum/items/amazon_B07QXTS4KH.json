The suction is great, it slides under the edges of my furniture easily and the attachments work well.The things I wish were different...the cord could be about 5ft longer. I wish it were a lighter. Beware of the green seal when using attachments, if you don't hold the nozzle just so, the seal will dislodge and you have to keep putting it back in place.",

                "reviewText": "I love this vacuum!I\u2019m going to start with MY cons for those just looking for negatives, but please read on because I have more positive things than negative things to say.Cons:The hose gets twisted very easy when going back and forth between the vacuum and hose. Simple to untwist.The joint from the head to the motor/body is just a little more weak than I\u2019d like. If I\u2019m using the hose and reaching too far it will fall over, while the head stays on the floor. I can see how this would be beneficial for anyone that has decreased strength when trying to vacuum normally, but for me it\u2019s annoying. I just keep my vacuum body right next to me with my hand on the top if I\u2019m really reaching.The standard filter it comes with is not sealed in plastic. I wish I would\u2019ve used the standard filter first instead of the sealed fabreze filter it additionally came with. The standard filter is basically collecting dust in my cleaning pantry.For smaller solid debris it clogged easily. Sunflower seed shells specifically. It was easy to take apart and fix though.Sometimes hair gets caught around the green center in the canister. If you give the canister a twisty-shake it will fall off into two pieces, and subsequently into the trash. It\u2019s just messy to get loose. There is no place on the vacuum to attach the roller, so you\u2019ll have to find somewhere to store it.The Pros/ background;Our first vacuum was a shark navigator.... 5 years ago. It worked great in our tiny apartment for $150 but then pets, kids, moving, and a crack in the bottom hose happened and it just wasn\u2019t doing the job anymore. We have 3 cats, so I wanted something that I KNEW would get ALL the cat hair. I order the Bissell from amazing warehouse for $160 versus the $230 (ish) it costs brand new. It was in the original box, there was no dust in the tubing, and all of the pieces were still individually wrapped in bissell bags.My order took a little over a week to arrive, and I didn\u2019t vacuum from the moment I ordered it. Normally I would\u2019ve vacuumed 5 times in that time frame. When it arrived it took about 5 minutes to assemble and read all the instructions/warnings.I first used my old vacuum to vacuum my 9\u2019x11\u2019 rug - then I used the bissell. I love validating a big purchase, and this definitely SHOWED me it was worth getting a new vacuum, especially this one.We do not wear shoes in our house - and I carpet clean between every 2 weeks to once a month (I like how it fluffs my carpet). I expected the vacuum to outperform my 5 year old shark... but I didn\u2019t expect what you see in the pictures. It picked up all of the super fine cat hairs, and so, SO MUCH DIRT. \ud83e\udd22 I cannot believe all of that was in my rug, which I\u2019ve only had 17 months.The pictures speak for themselves... it has amazing suction power. The attachments are nice also, I like the LED wand, and the pet hair rubber tipped one even more. The attachment that rolls when you connect it is nice for the stairs, but aside from the rubber coated roller inside, it is similar to others I\u2019ve used before.It maneuvers wonderfully, with a twist of the wrist to makes very smooth turns. Because of the way the head is attached to the motor you are able to turn the head basically 90 degrees while keeping the motor/body of the vacuum straight. That makes getting around my dining table chairs much faster when I\u2019m not moving all of the chairs.I liked that the handle, where your thumb would naturally rest, is where you adjust for carpet thickness. Moving from plush carpet to my rug is fast because I just flip the vent with my thumb for lower carpet setting.The hose is great on the handle, and has equal suction ability as the vacuum (if not more).Mine came with a Febreze filter insert in addition to the unscented original. It does smell amazing when running my vacuum, and is surprisingly only noticeable when running the vacuum. This is not mandatory to use if you are sensitive to smells. It comes in with a non scented filter.",

So, we finally sold our house in crappy California and purchased a home in Tennessee. Bad part, it has a house FULL of carpet. We have a double coated Border Collie/German Shepard, American Staffy, and a cat. I have really long hair and it falls out constantly. This vacuum is AMAZING - I got it on sale on National Pet Day or whatever it was called, ( it was last month and I got it for like $120 LESS than regular price) So, it was a no brainer. The canister is SO much better to empty than the Dyson you and everything falls out like it should. Dyson you had to stick your hand up in the canister and pull all the hair and crap out of it. It was disgusting. It's pretty heavy for me, im 5'6 and 127 so I need to raise the beater brush up higher because if it's too low, it's almost impossible to pull or push it. Im being dramatic - it's not impossible, but it's extremely difficult. It's extremely powerful. I really like it. Now, I need to buy a wet/dry/steam vac do to the carpets when someone barfs or brings in a dead bird or maimed squirrel as a gift for mom and dad. any suggestions on something that keeps the water SUPER Hot and will DRY very quickly.

It's been a long time since I owned a corded vac but man, it's a different world and this thing is awesome. To the critics; yes, it blows dust and hair away if you move too quickly because, well... physics. Slow down. Yes, you can stall the roller brush motor by getting it stuck on something. Takes two seconds to reboot it. The upholstery brush for pet hair won't get everything if you are in zoom mode but if you go slow then it will. It changed my life. Oh. Well...

Only issue is the holding container is a bit small and needs to be empty a bit more often. But it fills up quickly because it does a great job getting everything my other vacuum left behind.",

This bissell is perfect for me\u2026it has a beater bar that has the capacity to vacuum but not to be in use \u2026perfect for hardwood. When I want to use the beater bar for the small amount of carpet I have, I just press a button and on it comes. Love this bissell.",

                "reviewText": "Well my to cats who are long hair Calico's and with the carpet and area rug I have, there was always a light hair \"film\" left behind from my old vacuum, very frustrating.This was a super fast delivery so I was happy to get started.I found it very easy to assemble, it is however a bit weighted, but still a one hand task. I love the \"long pile/short pile\" options this way it can really dig into the different carpet, and that it does! The suction is good and I like how the beater bar gets right in there and have no hassle of hair build up. I find the LED lighting useless but it's there and maybe helpful to some. I also liked that I could use it on my kitchen floor. The accessories work really well, the mini power head did a great job on my cat trees and the window beds they sleep in. I even did the drapes with the soft brush and went hog wild and did my mattress, and clean out the radiators, just so see how versitile it could be, in all situations it did a nice job.The one thing though, is I wish the hose was a few inches longer to be able to reach the top of the large cat tree. The other thing I was slightly disappointed in is that it doesn't get under a bed and such very well because of its design, oh well have to pull out the bed somethings I guess. It stores in a tight space nicely and the canister is very easy to clean and empty. I have the manual cord wind up version, for the few seconds it takes to wind up the cord I don't see how the automatic one is worth it. Really it just has a little weight but it is a solid piece of kit.",
