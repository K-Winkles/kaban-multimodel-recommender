I ordered it from Amazon in case I needed to return it so the return process would be easier. Needless to say I do not see myself returning this vacume as it is even better than my dyson cordless vacum. The suction is great, it is light weight and easy to use. It has a great turn radius and fits under/ between all of my furniture without having to rearrange my living room to vacuum. Perfect for carpets and hardwood. The cordless aspect makes it easy to clean the car and hard-to-reach spots by switching it to hand-held mode. And it is slim and easy to store! Best Vacuum ever!!!",

                "reviewText": "This is the ULTIMATE Dyson dupe. I HIGHLY recommend. All the other vacuums like this on the market only work on wood flooring, resulting in needing a separate vacuum for carpet. Upon receiving the vacuum, the assembly was easy and I started using it right away. It works WONDERS, it gets in all the tight corners in my home and goes over the carpet seamlessly. It is also super lightweight and small enough to tuck away in a closet. The battery power lasts at least a couple days (it has yet to die on me yet). If you are looking for the perfect vacuum that doesn't break the bank, this is the one!!",

Overall I like it. It gets the Job done. It's lightweight. It comes with two attachments and a wall mount which I like. The batter drains faster when you increase suction, but you still get some good cleaning time out of it. The battery isn't as bad as the one on my shark. Does it compare to a Dyson or a Shark, not really. Is it a good vacuum overall yes. Do I recommend buying, yes.",
