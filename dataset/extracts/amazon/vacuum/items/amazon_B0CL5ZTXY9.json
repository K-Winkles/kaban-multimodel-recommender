The Insevac is 2+ pounds lighter and stands up by itself which the Tineco didn't. Great suction power at 2 1/2 times less in price ! I also like the retractable tube. The replacement filters are at a good price point, I hope that they offer 4 or 6 packs in the future. There is one accessare I wish they offered.....A smaller motorized cleaning head for cleaning the floor mats in my car..........Love the vac so far.",

I had not really though of a stick vac but actually it can be just as convenient as a handheld vac for picking up stray litter around the litter box. It also works well as a car vacuum if you go at it with a fully charged battery.The Inse is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It stands by itself or can be hung from a small wall mount.I prefer a bagged vacuum for major house cleaning but for small mishaps it's kind of a hassle to drag out a heavier corded vac. I recommend a stick vacuum as backup, and for me the Inse is working great!",

                "reviewText": "To say I\u2019m obsessed with this thing is an understatement. This stick vacuum has basically wiped out the need for a broom or my nice bissell vacuum. It cleans every surface from hardwood, to area rugs to carpet beautifully. The power it has is pretty impressive, battery life is fantastic, and it\u2019s tall enough for me to comfortably use at 5\u20198\u201d. I used to sweep my entire downstairs daily, then bring out the vacuum for area rugs- but now I pull out this one lightweight item (that stands upright perfectly and ticks away anywhere) and I get it ALL done with minimal effort. I\u2019m so happy my sister told me about these vacuums, it\u2019s made my OCD happy \ud83d\ude02",

In the 10 minutes I ran this vacuum around I couldn\u2019t believe the amount of hair and dirt it had picked up! There\u2019s 2 speeds low and high. The suction this thing has is unreal and also extremely light! I would recommend this to anyone with pets. Thank you!!",
