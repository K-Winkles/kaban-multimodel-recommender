Sucks great! worked very well on my tile and wood floor and the throw rug. Had to adjust suction for rug, so it didn't keep pulling it up, but once I found the right settings it was great. Sucks up larger pieces on the floor like crackers and chips. Easy to remove big wand for little wand to get messes on the chairs while doing the floor. It pops right off and goes back on easily. Like that the attachments are always attached and handy. Great for storage and convenient for use. Also like that you don't have to order bags or filters for it. That was always a pain with my old one. Also, you can see how full it is through the plastic. Very happy with it so far.",

                "reviewText": "I have many vacuum cleaners and they are all upright American style. And they are all nearly useless. Not only you cannot go under the furniture or between the legs of chairs, they don't have suction power, they clog often and they're nearly useless on hardwood floors.Not this one! It does all what I just complained above well and it's light and easy to empty. It's so easy to go to corners, Under anything. It's also easy to remove the head(?) And just use the tube to get even in very narrow spaces. And the suction power is adequate. Definitely better than of those other vacuums that are twice this size.It's great for pets even though it's not advertised fur it. Hairs or feathers or even seeds from my birds... It takes everything.And it has retractable cord. Something that exists fur decades but most American style vacuums still don't have it.Oh, and it's very cheap.",

I have to empty it a few times when vacuuming the entire house.(2) The bristles are made of a material that traps dog hairs so they need to be cleaned several times during usage.(3) no on-the-vacuum storage for attachments(4) suction is good but stronger would have been appreciatedOverall I like the vacuum.

                "reviewText": "To say this vacuum is a carpet and hard surface vacuum is a bit of a stretch. I bought it because I have a dog (face hidden to protect his identity) who sheds a lot. I have mostly hard surfaces and eventually plan to only have hard surfaces. The suction is good but not enough to get pet hair out of a carpet. There is no beater bar on the floor tool. The full cup picture is from me vacuuming all of the floors in my house. Pretty good!Then I emptied the cup and use the beater bar tool and vacuumed the just carpet around where I have my dog crate. I got up quite a bit more in hair. The tool is too small (smaller than my hand) to practically use even just for the one room I have carpet. Fortunately it will be going soon also so I\u2019ll keep it.It is lightweight which I really like. I also like that it is bagless and I can clean the filters. The suction is good on hard surfaces and I think it will work well for my furniture but I haven\u2019t used it on that yet.It is a good vacuum for the price but should more accurately be described as a hard surface vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "30 Dec 23 update: I am really happy with this vac. It has actually exceeded my expectations by a wide margin. Finally found the manual that explained how to vary suction and how the floor tool works. Read the instructions! Fantastic on cat litter that gets into those places the Shark didn\u2019t have the suction to lift. Easily emptied and cleaned. Washable filters are a great help. Changing my rating to 5\u2b50\ufe0fVery good on hardwood and vinyl floors, but not so much on low pile area rugs. More suction than I expected and more than my Shark ( which I grown to loathe). This vac does not come with a crevice tool. The built in upholstery brush is adequate. Works great on cat hair/dander. Works great on household dust and kitchen (dry) spills. I was pleasantly surprised by the little vac.Cord reel is very good with a warning marker to prevent overextending, but the cord needs to be longer. I am 6-0' tall and the extension tube and hose length are fine. The suction head fits under ever stick of furniture I have, unlike the Shark, and I can vacuum under the beds with ease now. The vac is light enough for your aged granny to carry about the house.There is no method to hang up the hose when not in use nor is it stowable on the vac which is a nuisance. Eureka failed on this point as I suspect this vac will be used in households where space is at a premium. Not including a way to easily store or reduce the footprint of the vac when not in use is remiss.If you can overlook the cord length, lack of a crevice tool, and no storage method then you'll be pleased with the vac. It really is light as a feather and is easily maneuvered. I am hard to please, as one can tell, but I don't think this one will disappoint.",

Esta vez simplemente no tengo otra opci\u00f3n.Tenemos un par de meses con una nueva mascota, adoptamos un Pastor Alem\u00e1n y por m\u00e1s que lo cepillamos, los pelos volaban por todos lados. No bastaba barrer y trapear dos o tres veces por d\u00eda, hab\u00eda pelos hasta en la sopa (o casi).Decid\u00ed hacer la compra de esta aspiradora luego de ver videos y comentarios comparando aspiradoras. Mi intenci\u00f3n inicial era comprar una inal\u00e1mbrica, pero viendo las rese\u00f1as, supe que la potencia de una aspiradora inal\u00e1mbrica de un precio similar ser\u00eda muy poca y que comprar una aspiradora inal\u00e1mbrica que igualara a esta ser\u00eda triplicar el precio o m\u00e1s. Comparando precio-calidad, nos decidimos por esta a pesar del cable.Una vez que lleg\u00f3, nos sorprendi\u00f3 que el cable apenas y se nota. Es suficientemente largo para aspirar una habitaci\u00f3n o dos sin problema. Adem\u00e1s es retractil con solo apretar un bot\u00f3n, por lo que una vez que se ha terminado de usar no hay ning\u00fan cable a la vista.Tiene muchas opciones de uso diferente, para aspirar sillones y textiles, para aspirar con boquilla y para aspirar el suelo o la alfombra. La hemos usado practicamente cada tercer d\u00eda y en mi casa no hay rastro de pelos de perro. Mi perro es el m\u00e1s feliz porque ahora no hay restricciones en cuanto a espacios o muebles a los que no se debe acercar.Sin duda ha sido una buena compra, pero la mejor parte es que mis hijos peque\u00f1os (de 8 y 9) la pueden usar. Es tan f\u00e1cil de usar que no tienen ninguna dificultad o excusa para usarla, as\u00ed que han aprendido a aspirar bajo mi supervisi\u00f3n.Si tienen hijos, definitivamente les servir\u00e1. Si tienen perros o gatos, la van a amar!!! Sea cual sea el caso, no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo es que viv\u00edamos antes de tener esta aspiradora en casa :D",

                "reviewText": "Not a bad little vacuum. It\u2019s super light weight but has pretty good suction. I have a Bissell stick vac that was $30. It worked ok for picking up hair and dust but not much else. I wanted something similar ( small and light) but with better suction and can hold a little more before needing to be dumped out. This is exactly what I wanted. We have a small house with hard floors throughout and not much storage space. I have a Kirby but the hard floor attachment needed to be replaced after only 2 years and it\u2019s heavy and not easy to store in a small house.This works really well for what I needed. Don\u2019t know how long it will last but for $120 I was willing to take a chance on it. It\u2019s easy to clean too and not very loud. Maybe as loud as a hair dryer. The hose could be a bit longer but it\u2019s fine.",
