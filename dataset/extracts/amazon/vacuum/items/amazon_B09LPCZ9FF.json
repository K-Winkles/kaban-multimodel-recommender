It isn't heavy has about the same weight as others. The noise of the vacuum was less than our last one. The suction was just amazing when we used it for the first time, it had picked up so much more than our last vacuum ever had. Has nice handle to maneuver it around. It doesn't have a headlamp but then again, we don't vacuum in the dark, not really necessary. The extra tools that come with it hangs on the vacuum which is really convenient. I do like how the hose connects and easy to replace if ever needed. Well made and we would buy again and again.",

                "reviewText": "For starters, once I received this vac this morning I had to try it right away. Was literally a snap to put together. It picked up everything & then some. When I went to empty it out I read the manual & saw that you can remove the inside plastic filter/tube, by turning it clockwise. It came out & went back in just as easy, and I was able to remove any pet hair that was in the upper portion of the tank. I haven't tried the attachments yet, but I really like the extended reach should I ever need to use it. The base swivels to get into those hard to reach places. After spending a small fortune on a Dyson that died after a few year, I said never again would I pay that much for a vac. Not only was this affordable, but it's a DYNAMO! My carpet hasn't looked this good in awhile (it's extremely old & needs to be replaced). Best of all it gives back to help animals who really need it, so I wasn't at all hesitant about purchasing it. While some people griped about it not having a frontal light, you really don't need it when it picks up absolutely everything in it's path. It is a bit on the loud side, but no more than any other upright, high suction vacuum. This is great for older people with arthritic hands as well, bc everything snaps in & out of place easily. It was a bit on the heavier side though, but I probably just had the floor setting too low (I just wanted the carpet cleaned, and didn't really care about anything else, was in a rush lol O.C.D. on my part). Overall I would definitely buy it again. Great buy",

With two resident dogs and occasional foster dogs plus daughters with long hair, well, it\u2019s been an epic hair battle for years.What I love: Hair doesn\u2019t stick on the roller. Picks up anything on the floor, baseboards or ceiling for cobwebs spectacularly. Canister of hair, dander and dirt empties easily. Like the way the attachments go on. My old Dyson was a puzzle to get the attachments to stay - well- attached. Love the cord rewind so that\u2019s neatly tucked away. Lightweight but powerful. Easy to move aroundWhat I wish was different: could use a little longer cord. It\u2019s generous but another 6-12 inches would be great.If you have pets or kids or just dirty floors, buy this vacuum!",
