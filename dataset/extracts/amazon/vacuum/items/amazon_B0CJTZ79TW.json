                "reviewText": "This is my review for TASVAC Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, 28KPa Powerful Cordless Vacuum 6-in-1, Battery Stick Vacuum Rechargeable Vacuum 2200m-A-h Up to 45 Mins. If you're shopping for your first battery operated vacuum and wanted it to compare to your corded quality vacuum don't. Battery operated units just don't have the power to compare. What they do have is convenience, lightweight and ease of use. This unit is on the inexpensive side of battery operated vacuums. It has most all of the features of this type of product. Adjustable handle height, decent suction, HEPA filter and non-scratching roller brush for use on hardwood floors are features that are included. Cheaper battery operated vacuums have smaller batteries. The runtime on mine on high is 15 minutes continuous. Low speed is about 20 minutes. So if you have a $50,000 ft\u00b2 home this probably won't last to do the whole home. Smaller spaces it's perfect. Battery operated units do not have big dirt containers. You will be emptying once or twice per vacuum. The only real negative with this unit that I see is that the hepa filter is not washable. You can clean it a number of times but would last much longer and work better if you were able to wash it. Two are included with the vacuum and additional filters are available here on Amazon. I found this information out by emailing the vendor and their excellent customer service department promptly communicating the information to me.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m having so much fun using this powerful yet extremely lightweight cordless vacuum. I had it charged overnight and was able to go through post-holiday mess (about 15,000sqft in 20 minutes) without it powering off yet. This is ideal for an effective quick sweep, especially if you have shedding pets. Also, great for older folks because it\u2019s so easy to lift and maneuver.Don\u2019t let the light weight and convenience fool you though -this thing has some serious power. It easily sucks up most anything from piles of hair to large leaves.For the price point range, this is a top-notch cordless vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "Super easy to use and very light weight. Love that this is cordless. One hand usage! Charges quite quickly and holds a charge for about 30 mins. Maybe more if you only use the low setting. I switch between the low and high settings. I mainly use on hardwood or tile but it has also worked on my rugs.Easy to clean but I wish there was a 2nd opening on the top of the filter.Con- the long wand does not stay upright when stored. To bad it does not have a locking feature where the wand and the head of vacuum are connected. It would help it from falling side to side or sliding forward, when stored.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is an excellent value for the price. The cordless design is useful. I had the time to vacuum two time and about half of the dining room before the initial charge has run out. It comes with a wall mounting kit if you would like to hang it, but I prefer to keep it in the broom closet. It does not take up much space, especially when disassembled.It is very convenient to charge, as you can disassemble it and charge the motor alone. It takes two or three passes to pick up pet hair or heavy debris in the carpet. The pieces fit together with a snap, and I have had no problems with their connection, so far. You can change the floor module for a stick or duster module, so you can easily transition from carpet to corners to stairs to cobwebs. It is sturdy. The light is bright and convenient when getting under those hard to reach areas. The reservoir fills quickly, especially when vacuuming heavy debris. That shows that it is powerful. The head is a little bit narrow on the floor attachment, as you can see in the video. It is still a great value, as it succeeded in clearing those three rooms\u2019 carpet areas. I highly recommend this vacuum. First, it is very powerful compared to other sweeper vacs, and second, it is an excellent value compared to other full sized handhelds.",

We have the option to either use it short or long; and there are several suction head attachments provided as well. It's light weight, super convenient to maneuver around the floor (or carpet), an easy process to empty the dust bin, and charging is swift! I've been using this for the past couple days and I can recommend this very highly!",
