                "reviewText": "I just recently got my Shark Rotator 502 vacuum. Let me tell you; it is a gem! I love the fact that it is lighter than my old upright, swivels the head into corners, is thin enough to get under the overhang on the kitchen cabinets, and sucks the heck out of the carpets!USPS dropped the vacuum on my doorstep just after the end of the big game between State and our long time rival. We won! The guys were leaving after we had knocked down perhaps a few too many brews, but we were all feeling good. I decided it was time to open the box and dig out my new vac.Putting it together was literally a snap, actually about four snaps. The instructions are on the lid of the box so I skipped over the instruction manual. After all, how complicated is a vacuum? I plugged it in and tackled five rooms before I even knew it. I looked in the canister and was amazed at how much pet hair and other junk was in it. I have a dog, Loxx, and a Cat, Tubbs, so you know I have pet hair everywhere. I emptied the canister in the trash and then it hit me \u2013 I needed to go to the source of my pet hair problem!Now dogs have an instinctive aversion to vacuums. Why, I do not know, but Loxx disappeared wherever I started my old one up. Tubbs on the other hand is ambivalent. After all, cats are descendants of Egyptian gods. I lured Tubbs into my experiment by giving him catnip infused gummies. One makes him relaxed, two makes him chill. For my experiment I upped his treats to four gummies. That may have been a bit too much because in about 10 minutes he was nearly comatose. But perfect for what I was going to do. It crossed my mind that I might be acting like Bill Cosby, only with a cat. But that was too much reflection for the moment.With Tubbs essentially passed out on the floor, I switched on the vac, dialed it back to \u201cMin\u201d on the suction, and attached the upholstery brush to the nozzle end. Perfect! I started by running the attachment down his back and he seemed to be enjoying it. It\u2019s not easy to tell the difference between purring and a vacuum and enjoyment is sometimes hard to tell with cats. After a few passes, I rolled Tubbs over and worked on his belly. I glanced at the canister and saw I was hitting the mother lode of cat hair. Since things were going so well, I flicked the suction level to \u201cMax\u201d to get a little more hair before I wrapped up. That may not have been the best idea. The next pass down Tubbs' tummy turned that area into something resembling one of those hairless cat creatures. Even though Tubbs was still conked out, I figured he might take out his missing hair on the upholstery when he came too. He does have a mean streak sometimes. \u201c Time to stop,\u201d I thought,I took the upholstery tool off the nozzle and sat the nozzle down beside Tubbs. I was reaching for the power switch to shut off the vac when Tubbs took a turn to the side and the next thing I knew, his tail was in the nozzle. I have never seen a cat come awake faster. The look on his face was a mix of terror and confusion.Before I could react, he was up and running wildly across the carpet with the nozzle and hose flapping behind him. Cat and vacuum were now united as one creature. He dashed around the room dragging the entire Rotator with him, turned and raced back into the other room, all the time being pursued by the evil vacuum. Tubbs apparently had mustered some super cat power. His next turn took him down the hall and that was his liberating move because the 20-foot power cord reached its limit and his momentum yanked it clean of the wall socket. The vacuum died, his tail came loose, and Tubbs disappeared to places unknown. I put out his favorite cat food and added an extra heaping of tuna this evening, but he still hasn\u2019t revealed himself. I am sure it is only a matter of time until starvation brings him into the kitchen and I can see if he still has a tail. I didn\u2019t see one in the canister when I emptied it, but, boy, was there a lot of cat hair.I have certainly learned my lesson. You should never vacuum a cat using the \u201cMax\u201d suction setting, and you should keep control of the nozzle at all times. I\u2019ll keep than in mind as soon as I can coax Loxx, my golden retriever, into the kitchen to deal with his hair problem. After all it can\u2019t hurt to try now that I know the right technique If you know anything about goldens, you know they are living, breathing hair factories. Maybe I\u2019ll dig up the instruction book and see if it has any tips on doing goldens before I start on Loxx. That might be a good idea.My best suggestion to Rotator buyers is never, ever, operate a vacuum after watching a big football game, especially if you like beer.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned two Dyson vacuums in the past. Unfortunately the quality declined and the price went up. Based on reviews I purchased this vaccum. I absolutely love it! I have 3 levels to clean so I truly appreciate the ease of removing the canister. It makes cleaning stairs so easy. As for the suction... wow! This vaccum picks up every tiny speck of dirt and dust. It is powerful but incredibly easy to maneuver over hardwood and carpet. The canister is easy to empty and clean. I'm 69 years old and have used many different vacuums. This is by far the best I have owned. I highly recommend it. You won't regret this purchase. Vacuuming is no longer a chore. It's a pleasure!",

                "reviewText": "I have been doing research for MONTHS looking for the perfect vacuum for my home and family of 5. My three kids are all under the age of 13. So we deal with lots of crumbs and messes daily. I got this vacuum after watching twenty or thirty different YouTube videos with titles like \u201cthe top 10 vacuums of 2022 & 2023\u201d- I also got it on sale for $249.99!I absolutely love this vacuum!!! I am so happy I purchased this vacuum instead of cheapening out and buying another Bissell that doesn't even get the dirt and crumbs off of hardwood like it says it will\u2026. Because then you just end up having to sweep. I refused to waste money on any vacuum this time and spent months doing my research on which vacuum would work best for my needs- I use it to clean the floors and dust the curtains, walls and ceilings using the attachment. The constant contact with floors is true to its word! I have never spent this amount of money on a vacuum before but I am so glad I finally spent this much on one because now I know I have a product that is going to last years and years and is easily cleaned and IT ACTUALLY WORKS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO! It cleans from edge to edge of the vacuum! It has a very powerful suction power and you can adjust the suction power on the handle. I love the lift-away option and the vacuum is so versatile for different cleaning jobs! I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING THIS VACUUM!!!",

The picture attached is what it picked up the first time! I was so grossed out I vacuumed again!! It still picked up more hair! Amazing! I will never use another vacuum again! My carpet feels soft and clean!",
