                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This Vacuum Really Sucks!",
                "reviewText": "We had a 20-yearold Eureka bagless that broke, and this was the nearest we found. Glad we did! It's a little larger than the broken one, but a bit less large, heavy and cumbersome than our old Hoover upright. And a lot lighter in weight! This one (somehow) came with the extra pet-hair mini roller brush, but I had to go look up the Bissell version on line to find out how to take it apart for cleaning the mini roller. Works the same, and the device is REALLY useful for getting into small places. We have a long-hair cat.With 8 amps, this thing really pulls up dirt! Seriously pulls up dirt! I set it to the low \"Carpet\" level, for an old shag carpet in the trailer house. I'm living here, but the owner's been here for a long time. I've been cleaning with that old Eureka, and it's (I thought) been pretty clean. I was getting a lot of fuzz, cat hair, and some fine dirt, but all in all, okay. Then I used this guy! Holy Cow!!The first pass after setting it up, there was almost an entire \"bucket\" container of something greyish-brown. Plus a lot of fuzz and a lot of cat hair. I asked the owner, who told me that many years ago, she'd had a flea problem and sprinkled diatomaceous earth all over. Fixed the fleas, but she never cleaned the carpets.Suddenly, I'm using this new Eureka and it's pulling EVERYthing out of the carpet! After only two times using it (back in April; it's now September), almost all that \"dust\" was gone. Now, I'm getting general dirt, cat hair, dust and carpet fuzz. Normal.1. After the first-time use, with the massive amount of \"newly discovered\" dirt, the roller bar was almost entirely clear! No wrapped hair or anything gunked up in the brush bristles. Amazing!2. Disassembling for cleaning, I found that the main vacuum body was almost entirely clean! No outer dust anywhere on the plastic. The only dust was at the connection hole between the body and the container bucket -- easy to clean with a swipe of a sponge or rag.3. Cleaning the container and filter was pretty simple, but a little bit of time involved.Cleaning:A push-button on the top handle releases the catch bin as a complete unit unto itself. There's another button near the bottom of that basin, which then releases a gravity-operated \"lid.\" BE SURE TO KEEP THE BOTTOM OF THE BUCKET WELL BELOW THE UPPER EDGE OF YOUR TRASH CONTAINER!By pushing the release button to open the bottom of the bucket, you're simply dropping out ALL the crud you've picked up in the catch basin! It comes flying out, dust-cloud and all! Still, there's some remaining junk clinging to the clear plastic bucket walls.I like \"BANG!\" cleaner spray, which is cheap (Dollar Tree), and works very well. I also have a spray attachment on the kitchen sink, which makes it very easy to get water inside the bucket \"tube.\" There's a plastic \"clasp\" or catch you pull on, to open the top of the overall basin. I'd imagine that catch will eventually break, but who knows.....none of the plastic on the 20-yearold ever broke.With the bottom open and the top hinged back, you can clean the entire catch basin. It's large enough (easily) that you can get your hand in there with a sponge. The BANG! makes it easier, and water rinses it all out.The entire filter section comes apart, which is why I bought this. You lift out the filter assembly (the instruction manual shows how), and there are several parts. The filter itself is foam with some sort of paper on top. It's there to prevent dust from blowing into the motor, and both the bottom (foam) and top (paper) got totally covered with dust. Being gentle with it, I was easily able to clean it under running water.I couldn't find these round filters anywhere in stores, so ordered a 6-pack of replacements on Amazon. Not all that expensive. I've used and cleaned this vacuum now probably 8 times (since April, it's now September), and the filter is still pretty together. I can see it's going to degrade, but if it lasts four months (or more), then I only need to replace it three times a year. Very cost effective. And this place has all the old micro dust along with the cat hair, so the filter has to get cleaned after each use. For \"normal people\" and their homes, I think you could use the cleaner several times without cleaning every single time.The attachments are all there, easily stored on the body of the machine. The hose attaches to the roller base during upright use, and comes loose to attach to the handle for portable use. DO follow the instruction manual! The places for the attachments, and how to connect the different hose operations aren't immediately obvious.Some people complain that the roller bar always turns. The old Eureka had a 2-way switch for upright (with roller bar), and portable (for smooth floors and portable use). This power switch only is On/Off. I don't care. You can raise the level of the roller for \"wood floors,\" if it really makes you anxious.All in all, having sold vacuum cleaners in the past, I'd have to say this is one of the most powerful machines I've ever seen for its size, weight, and price! Yes, it's all plastic, to keep the weight around 8-10lbs or so, but today's plastics are pretty rugged. I'm thinking it'll last long enough to be a good investment.",

The power cord is way too short. We bought this to replace an Oreck, which had a long-enough cord that we only had to move it to another outlet once. Now we have to move it twice just to vacuum the living room/dining area, and another two times to do all three bedrooms.2. There\u2019s no headlight. We sometimes vacuum in the dark, so we will probably buy a Dollar Tree battery-operated light to stick on the front. Not a huge issue because a headlight would probably jack up the price a lot more than $1.25.3. The motor emits a very loud high-pitched whine, which can be mitigated by using a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.Overall, this is a good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Quick back story: I've always been a Dirt Devil fan. They've had the best cleaning ability such as strong suckage (I don't think that's a word!) I replaced my old Dirt Devil with a new model 4 years ago and I hated it! So it's replacement was a Bissell. It held up pretty good until maybe 6 months ago the clip that holds the dirt in the cannister broke off. That became a nightmare when it came time to empty it into the trash can. So, I wanted to go cordless and did a ton of research but I'm not rich and I haven't won the lottery so the Dyson brand was out. I chose a brand of a cordless vacuum that in familiar with and own several other of their products. I ordered it and tried it out after it had been fully charged. I thought it did pretty good. I have 3 pomeranians and their fluff is everywhere. The second time I used it it didn't seem to work as well. I pulled it apart and discovered it had a blockage of hair and dirt in the tube. I couldn't figure out why exactly. I believe it was cuz I only vacuum once a week and I was using the turbo level and it was too much. So I thought OK I'll vacuum twice a week. I had the same problem. To make this long story longer I was disappointed. So back to the drawing board I went. I read all the reviews on this Eureka and decided I'd give it a go and if I hated it I would return it.Pro's:It has an extra large canister because, and it says this: you don't have to empty it so often. Apparently the creators of this vacuum cleaner do not lived in a home with multiple pets! Ha! I've used it twice now and had to empty the canister. THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT. I had to dump my Bissell after every single time.Weight: thus magical cleaner I think it said it weighs 8 pounds but I'll tell you what it feels like 5 pounds. It's so light weight you would think it was cheap and can't handle the job of 3 very fluffy dogs. I am happy to report it does the job very well. My Bissell never sucked up as much dirt or hair as this Eureka. It blows my mind that there is that much dirt in my carpets!Attachments: I honestly never use attachments. I'm a neat freak but on the flip side I'm also lazy and it's extra work to use them. On this vacuum it has 3 places to hold the attachments. My Bissell was the same but I kept knocking them off. On this model they're pretty secure.Con's:If I wanted to go back to a corded model I wanted a retractable cord. This model does not have that feature. To be honest it's a WANT not a NEED but it would be great if they changed this on the next model. I also don't wrap the cord on the provided pegs. It's a time waster!Cord length. I don't know why the manufacturer of any vacuum cleaner only gives you 20 to 25 feet!! Because I'm lazy I hate plugging it in one one end of my home and get to the end of the cord and have to stop, unplug, move it to a new outlet. Thus the reason I wanted a cordless vacuum. This cord is 23 to 25 feet long and I can't remember if it's 23 or 25. I have to use a 6 foot extension cord so I don't have to move it to a new outlet. I live in a duplex that has no stairs and I know not everybody isn't that lucky. I'm just saying because I live on one level the cord length would be great.I have owned several different brands of vacuum cleaners from a dirt devil to a Hoover and even a Shark. I also currently have a Eurkea quick up for my kitchen so I knew the Eureka vacuum cleaner was a good bet. Sadly they don't make these anymore.So, if you want a vacuum cleaner that sucks up a ton of dirt, have animals in your home, and is very light weight I recommend this model!",

                "reviewText": "Llevo 6 meses usando la eureka y puedo resumir que s\u00ed es una maravilla por su precio. La compr\u00e9 porque mi perro suelta MUCH\u00cdSIMO PELO y no pod\u00eda soportarlo. Dar\u00e9 punto por punto los elementos que he observado en los \u00faltimos 6 meses.1. Armado: S\u00faper sencillo. La aspiradora llega armada y s\u00f3lo debes colocar la manguera, la manija y el filtro. No tiene ciencia. Puedes empezar a usarla de inmediato. CONS: Para cambiar a modo manual son pasos que para algunas personas pueden ser molestos. Debes cambiar la manguera, ponerle el cabeza y cambiar la altura de la aspiradora. A m\u00ed me parece de lo m\u00e1s normal, pero lo comento porque para algunas personas puede ser un punto de quiebre.2. Aspirado: Tiene una gran potencia. No tengo ni idea de lo sucia que est\u00e1 mi casa hasta que veo el filtro lleno de PELOS Y POLVO. Y el mono manual para aspirar los sillones est\u00e1 10/10. Los cabezales, cuando aprendes a usar en las texturas, son una maravilla. CONS: La manguera manual es MUY corta; me cost\u00f3 un rato acostumbrarme y saber c\u00f3mo detener la base de la aspiradora para que no se cayera. Eventualmente le agarr\u00e9 el modo y me es muy \u00fatil. Pero ser\u00eda m\u00e1s feliz con una manguera m\u00e1s grande. Yo le compre un tubo de PVC del calibre y se lo puse para espacios altos... PERO no es lo m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo.3. Ruido: El de una aspiradora NORMAL. S\u00ed hace ruido porque tiene un motor que est\u00e1 trabaje y trabaje. Le\u00ed comentarios que dec\u00edan que era demasiado ruidosa y no me lo parece. CONS: Si eres una persona sensible al ruido, esta aspiradora no es para ti. Ni ninguna otra. xd4. \u00a1MANTENIMIENTO! OK, ojo aqu\u00ed. YO uso mi aspiradora DIARIO. Todos los d\u00edas aspiro y vivo en una zona polvosa. Despu\u00e9s de 2-3 meses, not\u00e9 que cuando la prend\u00eda sacaba POLVOO por las rendijas de respirado y me asust\u00e9. SIN EMBARGO, la desarm\u00e9 y la limpi\u00e9 por completo. Desde entonces le hago mantenimiento una vez al mes. Quito tornillos, mangueras, motor y limpio. Si esperas que siga limpiado como siempre pero no la limpias, esta aspiradora NO ES PARA T\u00cd. Su aramado posterior tambi\u00e9s es FACIL\u00cdSIMO. Y no necesitas artefactos s\u00faper pros. Yo uso un pincel (de pintura) para quitar el polvo del motor y todos los espacios posibles y una franela h\u00fameda. PERO TIENES QUE LIMPIARLA. Compr\u00e9 la garant\u00eda por cualquier cosa pero no he necesitado usarla. Cuando la desarmes no quites ning\u00fan bot\u00f3n naranja, esos no te sirven y NO jales el motor porque est\u00e1 soldado. S\u00ed lo puedes levantar de la base pero no desprenderlo por completo. Puedes lavar el filtro sin problemas.5. Calentamiento/funcionamiento: Nunca se me calienta y aspiro mi casa de un jal\u00f3n. Cuando se empieza a calentar es porque necesita limpieza.RESUMEN: C\u00f3mprala si est\u00e1s dispuesta (o) a la limpieza posterior, si no, terminar\u00e1s quej\u00e1ndote de que aventaba polvo. Si lo haces y le das mantenimiento, NO TE VAS A ARREPENTIR.",

                "reviewText": "We have a very large braided wool rug in our living room as well as several smaller braided rugs throughout the house. The vacuum I was using, a Dyson, was removing the dirt but at the same time it was catching & pulling up the loops of wool in my rugs. Even with my Dyson\u2019s roller bar turned off this continued to occur because I couldn\u2019t move the brushes out of the way. I searched local stores but found no vacuum that would lift it\u2019s brush section high enough not to snag the rugs. Finally a Google search & a recommendation from a carpet manufacturer led me to the Eureka Power Speed Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner. With the adjustable dial turned to \u2018High Carpet\u2019 this vacuum sails smoothly over our braided rugs as it powerfully lifts dirt, crumbs & hair. I was amazed at what had accumulated in the vacuum\u2019s dirt collector & not a single pulled loop in the rug! What a find!!!",

Ten\u00eda rato de no aspirar asi que la prueba fu\u00e9 ruda y la pas\u00f3 sin problema. La limpi\u00e9 despu\u00e9s de usarla y es sencillo de limpiar todas las partes y de volver a armar.
