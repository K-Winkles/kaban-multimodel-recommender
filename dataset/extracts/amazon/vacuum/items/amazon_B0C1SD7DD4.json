                "reviewText": "We got this vacuum on Prime Day, but was a little unsure about it because it's so much less expensive than other bigger name stick vacuums.I'm actually really impressed with it! It is super lightweight, but doesn't feel cheap. We have left it propped up from time to time and it has fallen over a few times because we have young kids and pets and things get a little chaotic at times. It's held up really well to those drops without anything cracking or becoming dislodged.We have super thick plush carpet in the bedrooms and it works really well on those floors. I was worried about that somewhat because out upright vacuum struggles on that carpet, but the stick one does fine. I love how you can choose the level of suction you want. I use the lowest or second lowest section for the hard floors, and then the highest or medium level for the carpets and rugs. Super easy to switch between levels.I have a love hate relationship with the green light because it almost does too good of a job showing me all the spots that need vacuuming, haha. I can't believe how much dog and cat hair collects in a day or even just a few hours. But the light really is useful for letting me catch it all. We used to sweep every night but now we vacuum and my husband feels like we have had less dust in general and I have to agree. It's faster than sweeping and we're not kicking dust up all over the place so overall a great alternative.The battery charge has been great too. I've never run the battery all the way down, even though I use it all the time. It's easy enough to just plug it back in a grab it again when you need it. The display shows how much battery is left and it adjusts depending on what level suction you are using. It came with a mount, but we've been too lazy to install it so far.The dust buster feature is great too and I use that all the time to get things in the nooks and crannies or behind things when I'm vacuuming and can't get it that way. I just carry the attachment with me and switch it out really quickly, dust bust behind whatever it and, and then switch it back.Overall I'm super happy with this purchase. It may not be as great as something like a Dyson (I don't know though because I've never used one), but it gets the job done and that's all I need it to do.",

                "reviewText": "There is so much to like about this cordless vacuum cleaner\u2026lightweight; the roller does not collect much hair, if any; the LED light to see where dirt and dust is hiding; so very quiet that it doesn\u2019t terrify our cat when in operation; easy to clean; easy to store; maneuvers easily in tight spaces; excellent suction with multiple levels of operation; battery life is sufficient for vacuuming my 2,000 sq. ft. home; the display is informative; priced lower than its competitors but works as well if not better than the top brands. Takes about 4 hours to recharge, but I have bought a spare battery just in case I run out of battery life. The attachments are easy to install and are helpful. The cordless vacuum experience is so much better than a corded experience.I have heard from many of my friends who have bought the more expensive Dyson equivalent that they only got about 7 months of use before it failed\u2026pretty consistent in the failure rate. I am hoping that by offering a 2 and 3 year protection plan that Ultenic is confident in the durability of their product.I can unequivocally say that this has been the best vacuum experience that I have had in the several decades that I have been vacuuming floors.",

                "reviewText": "I used have a dyson for my hard floors and it went bad so needed a good stick vacuum but did not want to pay six hundred plus for a stick vac. I came across this one and decided to try it.Since its arrival have now used it daily for about 2 weeks now! Yes we vacuum our living and kitchen space daily! I must say I am impressed, very impressed.The packaging is very modern and it was very packed, great for gifting since the box is very modern looking too! But the key measure for us was how well it cleans and I am happy to say that it totally compares to my old dyson V8 and less than one third the price.The green light at the bottom is a blessing, you can actaully see the dust and debris very clearly\u2026 so you will not miss any corner or space!I felt this is a little quieter as well, and has so many speed options!Emptying the dust is a click of a button, the battery life is super amazing and this one lasts us so much more! Picks up all the stuff right from minute dust particles to kids messes of cereal or dry food spills.One hand operation, smooth maneuverability, powerful suction, amazing battery life and more advanced than my previous vacuum for less than one third the price\u2026 what else could I ask for?Highly recommend this product! Totally works!",

Je suis extr\u00eamement satisfait car il coche toutes les cases importantes que l'on peut esp\u00e9rer d'un robot aspirateur et poss\u00e8de en plus des fonctionnalit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires.Voici ce que j'ai d\u00e9couvert dans la bo\u00eete de l'aspirateur ultenic U12 :\u27a1\ufe0f Une Aspirateur T\u00eate de moteur\u27a1\ufe0f Une brosse rotative anti-emm\u00ealement\u27a1\ufe0f Une Brosse polyvalent\u27a1\ufe0f Un Tube d\u2019extension\u27a1\ufe0f Une Brosse suceur\u27a1\ufe0f Un R\u00e9servoir \u00e0 poussi\u00e8re 1L\u27a1\ufe0f Un Support mural\u27a1\ufe0f Un adaptateur\u27a1\ufe0f Une batterie\u27a1\ufe0f Un filtre HEPA\u27a1\ufe0f Manuel Multilangue\u2705 Le design est vraiment pas mal du tout, la couleur varie du gris au gris sombre et il est tr\u00e8s minimaliste. Il est fait en plastique mais un plastique de bonne qualit\u00e9. Il devrait durer dans le temps.\u2705 La perche t\u00e9lescopique s'ajuste facilement , il s'ajuste et se r\u00e8gle \u00e0 toute les tailles. La conception pivotante de la t\u00eate de brosse est vraiment bien, ca s'adapte bien et permet une utilisation efficace sur toutes les surfaces. Je n'ai plus besoin de d\u00e9placer mon fauteuil et mes meubles \u00e0 chaque fois comme avec mon ancien aspirateur, car elle prend en charge les angles plats \u00e0 180\u00b0. Personnellement, je l'utilise \u00e9galement pour nettoyer ma voiture, il y a une Lampe de Poche Int\u00e9gr\u00e9e qui \u00e9claire les zones sombres et ca met vraiment utile pour nettoyer \u00e0 tous les coins et recoins, ce qui me permet de faire un nettoyage optimal. Les bords, les crevasses, les meubles et les radiateurs ne seront plus un probl\u00e8me.\u2705 L'Ultenic U12 poss\u00e8de une puissance d'aspiration de 30000Pa. J'avais des soucis r\u00e9currents avec des salet\u00e9s qui s'incrustaient sur le coussin de mon chien, et je devais les retirer \u00e0 la main \u00e0 chaque fois, ce qui \u00e9tait fastidieux. Avec le U12 j\u2019arrive \u00e0 les effacer efficacement.\u2705 L'aspirateur sans fil Ultenic U12 est dot\u00e9 d'une batterie longue dur\u00e9e pouvant durer jusqu'\u00e0 45 minutes, ce qui laisse largement le tempS d'aspirer toute ce que l'on veut. Ainsi, m\u00eame les grandes maisons peuvent \u00eatre nettoy\u00e9es sans interruption avec un r\u00e9sultat impeccable.\u2705 Je ne sais pas exactement comment ca fonctionne mais grace au syst\u00e8me de lumi\u00e8re LED verte j'arrive \u00e0 voir beaucoup mieux les poussi\u00e8res et \u00e0 les aspirer , apparement la Technologie GreenEye permet de voir les poussi\u00e8res microscopique.\u274c Le bruit de l'aspirateur peut \u00eatre un peu g\u00eanant lorsqu'il est en mode aspiration maximal, mais cela reste raisonnable.En conclusion, je le recommande vivement pour toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s qu'il propose, ainsi que pour sa puissance d'aspiration et son autonomie. C'est franchement le choix id\u00e9al si vous voulez maintenir votre maison propre et impeccable Pour pas cher",
