They slashed the price after it was in my cart, so I scooped it up quick! It\u2019s definitely worth it. Super easy to assemble, and it holds a charge very well. I use it on carpet and LVT floor (after sweeping). It picks up everything! It\u2019s very fluid and agile, too. Dumping the waste is literally the click of a button. Gone are the days of big, bulky vacuums with bags and long cords! The only thing I wish was that it had an extension to make it taller. If you are over 5\u20197\u201d you might get a cramp easily from having to lean so much.",

I have six cats and the amount of fur this gets out of the rug is unreal. The best part about this for me is it actually looks like you vacuumed with a full size vacuum.. the suction is very good and even pulls up the piles in the carpet. Having the suction strength options is also key because I'm able to now vacuum my bathroom rugs without them getting stuck up into the beater brush. Super glad I purchased this!",
