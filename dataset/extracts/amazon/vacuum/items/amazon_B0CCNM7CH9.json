This was perfect for what I needed it for. We have 7 kids and 4 large dogs so I vacuum and sweep daily but I don't like busting out the full size vacuum which doesn't fit under the tables and chairs. Came well packed in foam and the battery was even sealed. Also comes with extra filters in addition to the hepa filter. Everything comes apart for easy cleaning. It has 4 suction settings auto, low, medium, and high. All very quite compared to a full size vacuum. It's lightweight enough the kids can easily use it. Came with attachments that easily click into the wall mount which came with wall anchors and screws so it was super easy to attach to the wall. The battery came with a partial charge so it only took about 20 mins to reach full battery. You can charge the battery attached or detached from the vacuum. The lights make it super easy to see when it's fully charged. The screen is easy to read while using to see battery life and suction speed, I liked auto the best.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Everyone is on the Dyson hype, but the prices aren't affordable. I saw this one and for the price, it works really well. The battery came with half charge, so I gave it a quick try. There's 3 speeds, and even at the lowest, it picked up all the little crumbs from my hardwood floor. It's a bonus point that it comes with attachments to turn it into a handheld vacuum. It looks very nice and the material does not feel flimsy. The dust bin is medium size but that's not a deal breaker for me, since I can just easily empty it and keep cleaning. I will update soon if anything goes wrong.Update #2:I'm VERY impressed! If put on the auto setting, it changes suction power depending on the surface it's cleaning. Also comes with a washable HEPA filter. The suction power is measured as 33Kpa (kilo pascals) which is more than the average vacuum, usually being 20 Kpa. For the price, this is unreal! Battery takes about 4 hours to be fully charged, but that doesn't affect me.UPDATE #3I've had it for a few months now. No complaints! Great vacuum!",

I also don\u2019t vacuum carpet with it so it is not like it has had to work very hard. Don\u2019t waste your money.

Die drei Saugstufen und der Automatikmodus, der die Saugleistung an die Bodenbeschaffenheit anpasst, vereinfachen die t\u00e4gliche Arbeit mit dem VAKYOU VC001 \u2013 zudem vereinfachen die Leuchtdioden am B\u00fcrstenkopf das Erfassen von Schmutz sehr. Die Walzenb\u00fcrste arbeitet auf Marmor, Teppich, Laminat und PVC gleicherma\u00dfen gut und wird durch eine 2-in-1-B\u00fcrste sehr gut erg\u00e4nzt.Der gro\u00dfe Staubbeh\u00e4lter kann mit einem einfachen Klick geleert werden, ohne, dass man mit dem Inhalt in Kontakt kommt.Der Akku ist herausnehmbar, somit kann er auch au\u00dferhalb des Staubsaugers aufgeladen werden \u2013 im Automatikmodus gelingt eine komplette Wohnungss\u00e4uberung (100qm - ca. 45 min.), bei voller Leistung ist der Akku nach ca. 15 min. verbraucht. Seht hilfreich f\u00fcr die Leistungs- und Verbrauchskontrolle ist die gro\u00dfe LED-Anzeige.Was will man zu einem TOP-Preis mehr.Klare Kaufempfehlung!",

Bei h\u00f6chster Stufe h\u00e4lt er nicht die ganze Wohnung durch aber die h\u00f6chste Stufe braucht man im Normalfall auch gar nicht- Bedienung: Geht wirklich leicht zu bedienen, auch dank des gro\u00dfen Displays auf dem man alle wichtigen Infos ablesen kann- Leerung: Ist easy m\u00f6glich, einfach unten die Klappe \u00f6ffnen und der Staub f\u00e4llt herausBin mit dem Staubsauger soweit rundum zufrieden.",

Genauso gut l\u00e4uft er auf den anderen B\u00f6den. Wir haben am n\u00e4chsten Tag die ganze Wohnung gesaugt und alles auf der niedrigsten Stufe.

Die Entleerung ist mit nur einem Klick super einfach und im Gegensatz zu Bosch etc., die wir im Gesch\u00e4ft ausprobiert haben , ist der 10 viel leichter und super wendig.
