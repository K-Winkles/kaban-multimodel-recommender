                "reviewText": "Absolutely thrilled with my Bissell CleanView XR Pet! This vacuum has completely transformed my cleaning routine. Its lightweight and quiet design make it a breeze to maneuver, eliminating the need for multiple vacuums for different surfaces. With the freedom of cordless operation, I can effortlessly zoom around my entire house. The vacuum's ability to lay flat and reach under furniture is a game-changer, and the suction power is truly impressive. I was astounded by the amount of dust and pet hair it effortlessly picked up.The fast-charging battery is a lifesaver, lasting a surprisingly long time. I managed to clean both levels of my house without running out of battery, and there was even enough power left to use the attachment for detailing my baseboards. This vacuum has made cleaning not only more efficient but also surprisingly satisfying. I highly recommend the Bissell CleanView XR Pet to anyone in search of a powerful, versatile, and convenient cleaning solution.",

                "reviewText": "I use this product for quick, surface level, cleanups on my hardwood floors in the kitchen and mud room and to clean up the seats in my car. It's lightweight, easy to get into corners and crevices where crumbs tend to aggregate, and the battery lasts an incredibly long time. I actually had to search for the charger the first time I had to recharge it! The only downside is that the suction is lacking a little bit for slightly heavier pieces of dirt, food crumbs, or scattered pieces of kitty litter. However, I would say it gets about 90% of the junk that accumulates on my floor and car seats, which is good enough for me when I need a quick clean up! It's faster and more efficient than a broom and dust buster, which is perfect for our busy life with kids and pets.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I may have gotten a defective unit but that's no excuse - it should have been tested before going out. I received it last night, changed it and used it this morning. Can't even tell you how disappointed I was when it picked up a little dust and nothing else. I took off the head to check if it was clogged and looked at the brand new filter - it was clean and clear! There was hardly any suction at all - all dirt was on the floor (see pic). Not taking a chance with another Bisell (it's going back) - you shouldn't either.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted a cordless Dyson or other high end battery powered vacuum, but did not have the budget. I went with this bissell model and it has blown away my expectations. Excellent suction power and the battery life is actually pretty impressive if you keep it in the mid range power. Easy to change out tools and use on stairs, couches, etc. I do love the turbo mode for intense pet hair removal on our living room rug, door mats, and dog bed. It doesn't last long on the high suction (maybe 10 min?) but WOW it pulls up a ton of dirt and hair, 100% worth the trade off to have a convenient, cordless vacuum with high power suction. Of course this won't be a perfect trade off for a big clunky plug in vacuum but if you need convenience with still excellent suction power this is 100% worth the money and a great deal compared to other high end models.",

The individual parts were just all the attachments! Love the low profile head - easily swivels and fits underneath my cabinets where my regular vacuum doesn\u2019t. Lightweight and easy to hold, even with my carpal tunnel issues. Attachments are easy to put on and switch out. Love the hand held attachment - got all the cat hair off my couch in half the time it would have taken me to get out my vacuum and set up the hand attachment. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever use my bigger vacuum again!",
