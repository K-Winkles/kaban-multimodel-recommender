However, the outside hurts my arm so much after just a few minutes of vacuuming and is always a hassle to put together for just an easy cleanup. Enter this beautiful thing. I\u2019ve tried a few knockoffs of just the cleaner head for my Outsize with the double rollers and they all cost about the same as this machine but are terrible quality! You would put it on the ground and the roller would stop rolling from too much pressure. This is easy to drag on the ground and quickly clean up any small spills. I recommend this to anyone who wants that simplicity but isn\u2019t looking to pay for the premium label.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, I didn\u2019t expect very much of this little stick vacuum. I assumed it would be cheap plastic and performance would be lacking. I\u2019m quite happy to be wrong. The packaging was decent. The quick start guide is a full color foldout. The user manual is clear, well written and illustrated as well. It goes into further detail on how to maintain the filter and what is washable/reusable and what isn\u2019t. The presentation is like a brand name appliance.When I removed all the parts from the box, I was surprised to find it was not made cheaply, but instead felt very durable. Everything has a quality feel and the royal purple color is gorgeous. The wall mount bracket even allows you to store the accessories on it. They simply click into the bottom of the bracket and you press the release buttons to remove them. Someone put some thought into this.It took about three or four hours to charge the battery to full capacity and then I tried it out. The dual spinning brushes move over hard floors as if they are on ball bearings and it takes a bit of getting used to. It practically takes no effort from the user at all to move it. This would be great for anyone who has mobility issues who can\u2019t handle a heavy vacuum. The head can maneuver in any direction so getting under and around chair legs isn\u2019t a problem. It picked up crumbs, sand and soil from someone\u2019s muddy boots with ease. Hair sticks to it like a magnet so you may find yourself having to clean the brushes more often if you have pets.A couple times I had to change to max power when the dirt was close to the baseboard as it couldn\u2019t quite draw it in under regular power. I was able to vacuum over a rubber backed throw rug I have in my laundry room and it didn\u2019t interfere with the brushes at all. The only drawbacks I found are the small dust cup and there\u2019s no battery gauge to let you know when it\u2019s running low on power. It would be perfect for the apartment dweller who doesn\u2019t have the room for a full size vacuum with all the attachments, but wants the convenience of one that can clean more than just floors.",

                "reviewText": "I recently received the UMLo Dual Roller Hardwood Floor Vacuum and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I love this thing! This vacuum took literally a couple minutes to assemble and came with a directions pamphlet a user manuel. It even comes with a couple different attachments so you can clean nearly any space with it, as well as a nice mountable wall bracket to hold the vacuum and its attachments. This vacuum is great quality and feels very well made. I love that it's incredibly lightweight making it super easy to pack around from room to room. It takes very little effort to slide it across hardwood flooring and even moves across my many area rugs seamlessly with no resistance at all. It picks up dirt and crumbs from the floors and rugs extremely well...I was actually shocked by how much it got up when I went to empty the chamber. The battery holds a charge for several uses for me and I love not having to worry about managing any annoying cords. I find that this vacuum is so much quicker and easier than sweeping with a broom...plus, the brushes in the head of the vacuum are incredibly soft, so you don't have to worry about scratching up your floors. The head of the vacuum swivels effortlessly well and you can even lower the vacuum nearly to the floor to reach under things with ease. The UMLo Dual Roller Hardwood Floor Vacuum is such a great product...I have been using mine everyday since I got it. I couldn't be more pleased with this awesome little stick vacuum! I would absolutely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very different type of floor vacuum. It works fairly well. The vacuum level is less than what I expect. If I could change anything, it would be to increase the vacuum.It is an interesting design. Both of the lower rollers turn, pulling the dirt to the center where the vacuum sends it to the container. The container is pretty small, so we end up having to empty it after every use.All in all it is a pretty nice unit that we find we use. Well worth a four stars, but could have been 5 if it had more vacuum power.",

The suction is a lot better than the Eureka hand vac and the dust bin is a little larger as well. It's lightweight and the included attachments and heads are very nice. It maneuvers easily under chairs and such and the powered head kinda helps pull the vac across the tile.Good purchase.",
