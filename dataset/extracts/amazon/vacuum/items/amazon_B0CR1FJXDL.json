This cordless vacuum is perfect! It is a great size, lightweight, and it does a really good job at cleaning the floors. I like using it on max mode, but the battery doesn't last as long as it would on eco mode. The vacuum is also super easy to maneuver around as well.",

                "reviewText": "For less than 10 bucks I didn't really expect to receive a fancy vacuum that could cover all areas of my house with the efficiency of a pricier vacuum. I wanted a vacuum that would be small enough to store in my kitchen closet so that I could take it for a quick spin when the floor starts to get messy (with 3 kids and 3 dogs this happens frequently), and I wanted a vacuum that would be small and easy enough for my kids to use so they can practice some independence when it comes to pitching in on the household chores. This vacuum is both of those things.The first thing I noticed about this vacuum is that it has a really long cord. YES. I have another small vacuum that I keep upstairs for the kids to vacuum their rooms, but it might hold the record for world's shortest cord. You have to keep unplugging it to be able to reach all the areas, even in the smaller kids' rooms. It was a pain to use in the kitchen because I would have to unplug it and plug it back in a bunch of times. This vacuum can reach all areas of the kitchen and more without having to relocate the plug at all.The second thing I noticed is that it has great suction. It works really well on the wood floors, and picks up all the dog hair, crumbs, dirt and sand easily. While it does work on the short-pile carpet, it still can't get to things the way a vacuum with a beater bar can. I hadn't planned on using it for rugs/carpet anyway, because I knew it had no beater bar, so no harm done as far as I'm concerned.It comes with some attachments that aren't necessarily the best, however they do accomplish what they're intended for. I don't really plan on using the attachments, at least not very often, because that's not what the kitchen floor generally requires, so I'm not disappointed that they're not just as good as the attachments that came with my more expensive vacuums. There is an extra filter thrown in on the deal, which I thought is very nice.For my use, this vacuum is perfect, (not to mention it's a bargain and a half!), as it does everything I need it to do. But if you want a vacuum that can efficiently go from hard floors to carpet, then I'd keep looking.",

                "reviewText": "An impressive little vacuum considering how cheap you will immediately notice it feels. It's extremely lightweight and 90% of the plastic housing seems almost toy-like, but the suction it creates is remarkable and it cleans hard floors just as well, if not better, than my more expensive cordless stick vac.The lack of any brush agitators prevents it from being a good option for carpet, but allows for a smaller intake and just enough clearance to prevent it from sucking itself to hard, flat floors. In this way it's more reminiscent of a shop-vac and, in function, about as utilitarian. There are no catches or filters prior to the chamber, everything just gets sucked up into the dust cup you will then need to clean by hand. Though it is washable and a second is provided.It works well enough with dog hair on rugs and runners, pulling up dust and hair the >$100 cordless stick vac missed. The 30ft cord is nice, more than adequate for the apartment/dorm room such a vacuum would be best suited for.",

                "reviewText": "I have to start by saying that at the time of review, the price is one of the cheapest you will find anywhere. I have a larger Aspiron canister vacuum that I love, that has incredible suction power. This little guy......ummm not so much. It has good suction with the main floor attachment. But it has no rotating brush, it doesn't even have the thin sweep on the bottom that most floor brushes have. Sometimes they are a thin rubber, a dense strip of stiff bristle or a thin piece of felt that gently brushes against the floor and picks up pet hair, dust bunnies, and guides dirt into the suction chamber. It just has these two little tiny beads for front wheels and that's really it. The suction power goes down by a good 50% when you use any of the attachments, especially the upholstery brush attachment. It's also really hard to pull the attachments off and swap them out. They are square shaped so you can't use different brands. The super long cord is great, but there isn't a rubber cord clip at the end of the plug like 90% of appliances. So after winding the cord around the hooks on the handle you have to tie the cord in a knot. Also, that makes it a little heavy and it will fall over from the weight if you don't very gently stand it upright and steady it for a moment. I have 3 other stick vacs and they all have about the same mix of imperfect issues. This one is no better and no worse. One good thing is that the motor does not get hot quickly like many others I have tried. For the price, you can't beat it. But the lack of a sweep on the bottom of the main floor head is a bummer and I feel the makers of this vac really shot themselves in the foot by not adding that into the finished product. They really missed a simple yet powerfully small addition that makes a huge difference in the overall performance.",
