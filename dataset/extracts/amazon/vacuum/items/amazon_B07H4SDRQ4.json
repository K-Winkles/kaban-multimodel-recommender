I got this EyeVac on the recommendation of others and put it in a neutral spot, swept up the hair into a pile in front of the EyeVac and a press of the button and the hair is sucked in and all gone. It is lightweight and can be moved from room to room but we mostly leave it in one spot. The only downside is how loud it is but the noise is there for mere seconds so not a big bother.Since adding this to our house I am no longer dragging a trash bin around while I sweep up the dog hair and I am no longer fighting to keep the dog hair on a dustpan while walking to a trash bin, and I am no longer fighting with that line of dirt that does not want to be swept onto the dustpan, just sweep it in front of the EyeVac and voila, the EyeVac sucks it inside never to be seen again until I clean out the container and filter, and that can be carried outside to be cleaned out so no dust or anything is released back into the house.",
