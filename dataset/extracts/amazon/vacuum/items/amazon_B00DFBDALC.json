Here are the reasons I love my Shark Rocket, in random order:1. Sucks hard, trustworthily2. Comes with a selection of helpful attachments3. Easy to dump and clean the container4. Easy to clean the filter pads5. Relatively lightweight - I have horrible back problems and this is a breeze6. No bags! The heck with bags. Save the environment. Dump the nasty contents of your vacuuming adventures directly into the trash.7. The pole! You can hold the vacuum like a flamethrower! Get the spiderwebs off your ceiling with ease! Get into any corner! Onto any surface! No stupid floppy hose! Just use the pole to obliterate all of your gross corners.8. Great price! You'll have this vacuum for years and years.9. Simple, uncomplicated. A doorknob could immediately figure out how to use this vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "You're reading reviews for this vacuum because you have two concerns: hair and weight. Consider your problems solved.First, hair. As you can see from the attached image, I have the kind of long, extremely thick hair that strangles vacuum rollers dead in nanoseconds. This vacuum's roller has a groove carved into the plastic so you can quickly and easily slide a knife or scissor blade in, severing every hair with no hassle. Instant cleanup, no destroyed roller.The suction is no joke. There are two settings: one that is as powerful as my old vacuum on max power, and one that is TURBO CHARGED. This will demolish ground-in dirt and hair even from high-pile carpet or rugs. The suction is so powerful, even carpeting and rugs that have been pounded completely flat have the fibers physically pulled upwards, so even if your hairy little monster of a pet likes to destroy carpet or rug fibers, after vacuuming they feel plush and wonderful. Con: on Turbo mode, you will smell burning hair. The motor really is not kidding around and will set itself on fire before it allows the tiniest speck of dirt to remain on your floor.Second: weight. It's remarkably lightweight and very easy to heft around even with tiny elf arms. The maneuverability of the vacuum head is excellent and can work around such tight unwieldy places as between chair legs. All the pieces pop apart and reassemble with no trouble, so storage and transportation will never be an issue. Con: almost all of the weight is in the top handle, where the motor is. This can make it a tiny bit difficult to get the vacuum head to stay on the ground properly, and makes it nigh impossible for you just to stand the vacuum up anywhere and leave it there. Being top-heavy does it no favors.General design con: the canister is somewhat small and connected directly to the motor so you can't just pop it out, empty it into a bin, and pop it back into the vacuum. It's very easy to empty, but you are still going to have to heft the motor around with it, and the motor is obviously still going to be plugged into the wall. Good news is that the motor/handle/canister all pops free of the other bits with a simple lever press, so it's not like you need to carry the entire vacuum with you when you head to the bin.Bonus pro: there are a huge number of attachments, heads, and specialty bits and bobs in with the vacuum. I don't know what half of them are used for. Some are obviously for cleaning off stairs, or ceiling fans, or getting into crevasses, but some of them, who even knows. Literally whatever kind of application you'd like this vacuum for, there's probably a specialized nozzle for it. This is the cleanest my stairs have been in four years.Final pitch: look, I get it. I have a A Thing about money where no matter how worthy a purchase it is, a triple digit price tag makes me flinch. I put off getting a new vacuum for months and watched my own mental health spiral, knowing a contributing factor was that I was living in rising masses of dirt and grime. Danger had its element, too; a pie plate exploded (don't ask) and glass shards found themselves all over my kitchen floor, and some ended up in my feet. No vacuum to clean up the shards I couldn't see and couldn't get up with a broom and dustpan. I know being surrounded by painful messes we're powerless to fix is a 2020 mood and all, but this metaphor is a little too on the nose. I caved and bought the vacuum. I cranked her up this morning. This is the best I've felt in months. I know the price tag is a little steep compared to other lightweight vacs, but it's powerful and versatile enough that it's absolutely worth the expenditure.If you're looking for a worthwhile vacuum that will demolish human hair, pet hair, ground-in dirt, and particulates from any flooring you could possibly have, all while staying under $200, this is it.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought a Tineco battery sweeper. I wanted something light weight to do a quick sweep everyday. I have two dogs and three kids. As soon as I bought the Tineco A11 pet vacuum I was not impressed. Decided to keep it and it totally stopped working with 3 weeks. This shark was 1/3 of the cost I wasn\u2019t expecting much. This is awesome! I only have carpet in 1 room. I bought a regular vacuum for that room. Thinking this would not be great for deep cleaning or carpet! I was wrong!! It got so much out of my carpet. Worked a million times better than the Tineco!!! I was worried about the cord and wanted light weight to take upstairs. The cord is long and not an issue! Buy the one with the cord!!! I changed the batteries in the other one twice and still couldn\u2019t sweep one level of my house. This clearly has more power and can handle pet hair. Works perfect on the couch! The grip on the handle is nice! It\u2019s easy to get around and maneuvers well. It actually sucks up pet hair!! I\u2019m very impressed and I\u2019m super picky. I actually don\u2019t even think I need the standard vacuum anymore bc this works so well. However, I will probably end up keeping it bc I\u2019m so impressed with this shark sweeper that I\u2019m not disappointed about ordering both! Don\u2019t underestimate this! I bought two vacuums for the price of the original one I purchased and this one surpassed my expectations!",

                "reviewText": "My biggest problem with this stick vac is the heavy motor at the top. Makes it unwieldy to maneuver and hard on the back to operate. Some of the big, burly guys doing review videos mention that it's light weight. Assuming their estimate of 8 lbs, that's heavy when it's in the top location.Power switch is conveniently located and well labeled.It seemed to do a pretty good job cleaning relatively low pile carpet and tile.The roller was not overly tangled with hair. More hair in the bin, which was extremely easy to empty and clean out.No printed manual in the box. I download manuals anyway. There is no wall bracket included. I looked through all the packaging 3 times. The there is a handy bracket at the bottom that holds the heavy motor section, which is very easy to move down. Balances the vac for easy storage.For me (80/f) the awkward weight is a significant design flaw.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum and I\u2019m very glad to say it has lived up to expectations.The suction on this is incredible and I find it very easy to use to get dust on baseboards and furniture. I\u2019ve vacuumed so much more since I\u2019ve gotten this. The storage cup is small so you will have to empty it regularly, but I don\u2019t mind as I usually have a trash can near by to do that. I live in a condo so I\u2019m also not covering a lot of space.I will agree with other reviewers and say it is heavy on the wrist, which might be too much for some. I work a physical job though and am a young mom so it only took me a few days to get use to and now I barely notice or care.The biggest selling feature to me is the fact that it stands to store. I didn\u2019t want to have to mount a vacuum on one of my walls and so that more than anything sold me on this model. The second suction level does an incredible job on my rugs and with two cats and two kids that\u2019s a big plus too.For anyone worried about cord length, I can reach my from the front entrance of my condo all the way to the back of the living room (+35ft) with ease from a single plug in the middle. So unless you have a huge house or a closed off layout you should be able to do at least 2-3 rooms.Over all if you\u2019re comfortable handling the weight of it I would 100% recommend this vacuum.",
