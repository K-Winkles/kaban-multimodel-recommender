                "reviewText": "For a long time our vacuum has been on the fritz and very undependable. I've had to pay a house cleaner to come because I didn't have the time or funds to buy a new vacuum for awhile. On Prime Day we purchased this Bissell Vacuum. I have to say, it does a very good job so far. We have only had it for a week so I will update my review after some time. So far though, it picks up very well. It has very strong suction whether from the floor or from the removable handle and hose, which is a feature I really like and comes in handy for getting the cobwebs off the ceiling. I like the retractable cord, but I have a feeling that after some time, it will stop retracting so well or altogether. I've already had one instance where it didn't want to retract all the way. I like the color and I like how light weight it is. I also like that it is fairly quiet as well. Overall, for the price, this is a very good buy and I would recommend it after the short period of time of use.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this vacuum for a couple of months now. Here's the scoop:This vacuum does what it's supposed to. It's nothing fancy... no crazy bells, or whistles. It's just a solid product with decent suction power, and a couple of attachments. It will most definitely clean your floors. For the price, I'd say it's hard to beat.A couple of small criticisms...The detachable canister is small. For me (living in a small, 400 ft\u00b2 apartment), it's not much of an issue, but if you live in a larger abode, it might be a little bit of a hassle. It also empties from the bottom via a latch, which tends to send dust clouds everywhere as it empties, if you're not careful.The power cord... While I like the retractable power cord, it's mounted on the lower end of the unit, and I find myself running over the cord on occasion while using the product, which can't be good for it. It might just be me, because I'm still used to my old unit, which had its cord mounted higher. Still training my brain with this.Overall, a good product... would recommend.",

The suction hose extends out easily to reach hard to reach places. The accessories make cleaning a breeze! I have three indoor free roaming rescue rabbits and three indoor rescue cats this vacuum cleans up all of the pet hair! It was easy to assdemble. The best thing is that Bissel donates money from your purchase to animal shelter. I highly recommend this vacuum!",

                "reviewText": ".....and I'm glad! It's very powerful, versatile with the handheld tube. It rejects certain things if they shouldn't go, like a q-tip. I recommend it for a large house, but I live in a small apartment. With the upholstery brush, it could vacuum your car too. There is plenty of suction power for that. Assembly is easy, I didn't use the manuel. Very long cord, it's at least 10', maybe longer. It also seems to dial the suction down a tad if you lock it upright, to move it elsewhere for more vacuuming. Also, plenty of space in the canister for dirt, You shant need to empty it every time. Just periodically. Excellent value.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this vacuum cleaner because my other one finally croaked after almost 15 years, and needed to get a new one. I researched and researched, and finally settled on this one, and after one month month, this is my assessment so far:- Price: This vacuum definitely punches way above its weight when it comes to price vs value. While this was not the cheapest vacuum price-wise, it is what I believe to be by far the best value for the money, especially considering the fact that it comes from an established brand with a great reputation for building high quality products.- Quality: excellent quality. The vacuum is solid, even though it's all plastic. The vacuum is small and compact, yet powerful, especially when my old vacuum cleaner, it feels like 15 years of technology advancement really made a difference for me. The retractable cord is a nice touch for a vacuum of this price point.- Suction: This vacuum cleaner is a powerful one. I have wooden floors, with a smattering of area carpets, and this vacuum has done a wonderful job of cleaning both surfaces with no problem whatsoever.One thing to note, and maybe this was just me. Part of the handle was already broken when I got it, but I'm pretty certain that it was done somewhere on transit. I decided to keep it as is instead of sending it back because I really needed it, but you might want to make sure that there are no broken pieces.",
