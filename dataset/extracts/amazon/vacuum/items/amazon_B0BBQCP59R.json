                "reviewText": "Ordered the vacuum on a whim. It arrived 2 days later and was all it promised to be. We charged it once and then the charger cord died and wouldn\u2019t hold a charge (verified by an electrician). This was within 3 weeks of having the vacuum. Tech support is sending me a new cord, but it\u2019s back-ordered so they don\u2019t know when it will be here and the recommended just buying a new cord off Amazon. So my husband did - except it never came (was marked as delivered). So I have a vacuum that I like - but I can\u2019t use it now because I can\u2019t charge it until we get another cord.For those who say the suction isn\u2019t great - it isn\u2019t. But the vacuum has 2 levels of suction. If you press the button on the top when it\u2019s on, you get the high level of suction. It does not replace my big Dyson, but not having to pull my Dyson out as much is nice. And my ten year old will use this cordless one because it is lighter and quieter. It\u2019s great for the cobwebs on the ceiling and ceiling fans! So as long as you can charge it, run and clean away!",

                "reviewText": "I have owned this Kenmore vacuum cleaner for more than one year now, and it is a work horse. I use this light-weight vacuum multiple times a week and it does such a great job picking up pet hair, dander, dust, crumbs...you name it! I use it on both hardwood and carpet, as well as rugs, and it does a wonderful job. You can easily empty it after each use. I'm sure you can purchase filters for this vacuum but I just tap out anything in the filter and take an old toothbrush with soap and water to the filter to clean it. I let it air dry and pop it back in. No issues. The one downside I have noticed is that where the vacuum detaches to become handheld, the fitting is starting to loosen. I hope this eventually doesn't break before it's even been 5 years.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this vacuum cleaner and the warranty through the company Amazon uses when you check out (prompts to purchase the coverage when you check out). The vacuum seemed to work at first. The battery life is definitely on the shorter side. It would run out pretty quickly on the high powered mode.One month into owning it, the suction stopped completely. It comes apart in a couple areas so I was able to look straight through the stick part, the canister, the filter, etc. There wasn't anything clogged anywhere. It just stopped picking up everything. Here's where it got ridiculous. I called the warranty company. They say they don't anything in the first year because there's a manufacturer warranty. So beware this plan doesn't help you AT ALL for at least one year. So they gave me Sears number. They said they manufactured it. So I call them and get a complete run around. They eventually say there's no techs in my area and to take it anywhere to be fixed. I asked if it would be covered under the manufacturer warranty and they hung up. I called back and was told the same thing and that there wasn't anything they would do to help. I asked for a supervisor to see if they could help further and the rep laughed and said they were in a meeting for 2 hours so I would be on hold a long time. I couldn't believe the lack of help. I searched on Sears website and found another 800 number to call for warranty issues. Called them and got an website to submit information for a claim. On that website there was another number to call if there's no techs in your area. I called them. They went through a long process and the representative told me there was a clog and I needed to find it. I told her I already looked clear though all parts and nothing was there. She hung up on me. I called back. Got another rep who emailed me a warranty claim form. This company was not Kenmore, Sears, or anything related to the warranty company I purchased. It was some unknown company and I was unsure if they were even the correct people I needed help from. They told me to cut the cord and send a picture of it. I didn't want to take a chance with a company that didn't manufactor or sell Kenmore products and get the warranty voided.I called Amazon and explained everything and they accepted the return and gave me a refund. Beware of the headache you will have trying to get this thing repaired. No one wanted to help. Amazon is amazing but Kenmore doesn't stand behind their product and the warranty you buy from the 3rd party on Amazon is worthless. Call Sears or Kenmore and try to see about getting your vacuum fixed under the warranty. The model number is in the Amazon title for the listing. You will see how impossible it is. Call the warranty company that Amazon uses as the 3rd party. Tell them you just bought it a month ago and they will tell you no coverage on it until the first year. You will see you will be suck with a broken item with no help, even with warranties covering it from 2 separate companies. It's a joke.",

This is also lighter than the shark but the other down size is the collection canister is smaller than the shark so had to empty it move often. I have a dog yhat sheds alot. It did mot clog and got the hair up. Would recommend for someone with a smaller house or apartment and no carpets. Works great on my hardwood floors but not so great on my rugs.",

Amazon made it right with stellar customer service.- The battery life was amazing for the first month of use, but has tapered off significantly. Like probably half of what it was as new.- The mounting base doesn\u2019t have anything to hold the charger or crevice tool. Just a hook if you want to throw them in a bag. Kenmore missed the mark on that- You will need to buy replacement filters from time to time, depending on usage- It can\u2019t be a full house vacuum for anything more than 1000 sq ft, and doesn\u2019t quite get a deep enough clean compared to my Dyson.Overall, for the price, it does a great job for the daily maintenance from kids/pets but don\u2019t have this one in mind to be an all-in-one vacuum.",
