                "reviewText": "I had a shark cordless vacuum that putted out after 3 years of continuous use. I was thinking about getting another cordless one, but the charging before vacuuming idea didn't sit well with me anymore. I decided to try this one out, seeing as it was cheap and a shark/ninja, my favorite brand for most things.This thing is amazing. When I tell you the suction is awesome, I'm not joking. When I first took it out for a spin, I was very impressed when I noticed that I would go straight but the vacuum would suck up things that were on the side of my straight line. I was very impressed. I also like the attachment that has the crevice tool with the brush built-in very innovative. The cord is very long and I can get most of my downstairs without having to move the plug. I shed hair everywhere, but the mechanism of the brush makes it so the hair doesn't get stuck! Also, it's low profile design goes under a lot of my furniture so I don't have to move things around. And it's so light! Overall, this vacuum is beyond amazing and I would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first stick vacuum purchase. I had no idea what I was missing out on! It\u2019s so easy to maneuver around and under furniture. I like that you can remove the handheld nozzle and use that on things like couches or stairs. Or keep the pole attached in order to reach things that are further away. It\u2019s a powerful little machine. I wanted one with a cord because I have a fairly large area to cover and didn\u2019t want to deal with recharging or reduced power as the battery fades. It has a nice, long cord. You can also remove the top handheld nozzle and hang it on the machine so that it stores in a compact, upright position. It does get pretty warm after using it a while, but there\u2019s no indication that anything is being damaged. I do wish the dust bin was larger, but it\u2019s very easy to empty. Easy access to filter for cleaning. I\u2019m using this on my hardwood and tile flooring and using my full size Dyson for the carpeted areas. I like that this has a soft brush that is gentle on my floors and does a good job picking up dust and small debris. As far as purchasing a renewed item, I honestly couldn\u2019t tell that it wasn\u2019t brand new. There were no visible blemishes. Everything was included and so far in perfect working condition after approximately 2 months of nearly daily use.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely obsessed with this lil vacuum!! I thought my apt with no storage closet was too small for a vacuum but this fits in such a tiny space. It's super powerful and SO easy to use all the different options (full vacuum, just the wand, etc). I have a 750 sq foot apt that is vertically spread out and the cord (plugged into the middle room) reached 90% of my apt. Really easy to clean out the debris - I will probably need to clean it out after each full apt use but that's okay bc of how easy it is to do so. Kinda annoying that it doesn't stand on its own but I appreciate that you can store it upright by removing the top part and hanging it from the bottom. I have a dog and this got up dog hair that I didn't even know existed + all the fall leaves that track into my house. This is my first Amazon review ever, I am just so jazzed about the vacuum!",

Love the headlight it has to highlight dirt/debris!The bad:1. It doesn\u2019t stand up in its own. Literally defeats the purpose of a quick vacuum as I have to gently lay it down or unhook the top and hang it from the bottom so it doesn\u2019t fall over every time I have to move/pick up something it shouldn\u2019t suck up like cords, etc?2.I\u2019m short and it\u2019s uncomfortable and challenging for me to use. The angle I have to use it at often makes it click into the upright \u201clock\u201d position and the handle being so long makes it really hard to maneuver for my 5ft stature.3. You have to make yourself a little tool belt or something for all the accessories if you want them with you while you clean because they have no onboard storage for them.So far the refurbished status doesn\u2019t seem to be attributable to any of the faults I have with the product and so far it seems to work great although it does get pretty hot after a short time so I hope that\u2019s no indicative of future issues.",

This gets the job done, love the versatility of the tools, and ability to use for car clean up. Like the long cord, cup is small, but no biggie, actually like it that way.",

                "reviewText": "Love this vac! I have the older model, but the motor is heavier and being on the top of the stick made it tougher on my back. I\u2019m a disabled Veteran and vacuuming is the most difficult household chore for me. This vacuum is a lot lighter, smaller and super easy to maneuver anywhere you need to go. I can get it under my bed without difficulty and it almost drags me along for the ride. This refurb came in excellent condition. Looks brand new! With the flaps on the roller, fur a hair doesn\u2019t get tangled. It just sorta wraps around the filter in the bin. The only downside is that the removable bin is kinda small, so you\u2019re making more trips to the garbage can, but otherwise it makes vacuuming a lot easier for me!",

                "reviewText": "I bought a brand new shark cordless vac from Walmart for $150 on sale, from the start it was average at best. I had no idea what I was missing til I read reviews on this vacuum and decided to take the plunge. For a quarter of the price I have a vacuum that tackles everything, especially cat and dog hair. It doesn\u2019t plug the vacuum up! I have vinyl flooring, rugs, and carpeted stairs. It handles it all so well, I\u2019m beyond impressed! It\u2019s easy to clean the canister. Some minor negatives - It does not sit upright on its own. The turn angle can be awkward and sometimes hard to maneuver around edges. The battery pack feels warm after 10 min of cleaning. Knowing all this, I would still re-purchase !",

                "reviewText": "Bought the Shark UV580 corded stick vacuum for my elderly parents. They had the Shark Navigator upright vacuum previously, but wanted a lighter one with same capability and power. So no cordless. The UV580 was a older model, cheaper than current models. It had dual powered rollers, LED lights, swivel, easy empty, crevice tool, and furniture brush. My only issues were the vacuum is not self-standing, and stacking the hand-unit on the base seem a little loose/unstable. Wish list: If the cord could be retractable somehow.",
