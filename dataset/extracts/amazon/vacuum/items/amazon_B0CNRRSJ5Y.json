                "reviewText": "So light! At full power, it does just fine with carpet. Exactly what I need it to do. Picks up my cats fluff, and leaves lovely vacuum lines in my carpet. The battery gets drained real quick on full power, but it's enough to thoroughly clean one level of my home, or quickly sweep up the main floor and upstairs. If I ran it at mid power, I could probably clean my whole house at once, if I was feeling ambitious. It's easy to take apart and clean, and the filter does a great job of keeping dust in. I got it mostly for cleaning my stairs, and as a bonus car vacuum. Instead, I've found myself using it nearly everyday. Just love it. I hope the battery and filter replacement aren't too expensive or hard to find.",

This little vacuum is so easy to hook up, maneuver and store. The clean up is simple and allows you to keep it clean. The ONLY downfall I see is the battery, if you run it on the highest speed you lose battery life quickly, better to run it on 2nd speed.",

That being said the battery does last for 40+ minutes and the suction is good just don't expect a Dyson.This vacuum makes it much easier and faster to use vs having to lug out a similar sized vacuum that has to be plugged in to use.Regardless I would recommend this to anyone who likes portability and ease of use.It's been a great product to use.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this is really a great vacuum! Easy to use and clean. It's light weight and very maneuverable.Why did I rate it one star if it's so great?NO SPARE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE!!!I contacted Eureka directly about obtaining an extra battery, an extra HEPA filter, and an extra cotton filter. I have all of these part numbers from the owner's manual. After several back-and-forth e-mails with Eureka, I was told that this model, NEC370GN, was too new of a model and no parts are available.Say what? What company sells a product such as this with ZERO support? Eureka!!!I was told that if I needed parts that I should contact a company called Encompass. I'm familiar with this company and have purchased from them in the past. Ok, I get on their website and send them a message telling them what I have and what I need. I supplied all the numbers that they need to ID the vac and the parts.Encompass tells me via e-mail that they need more info to 'research' the product. They need me to send a pic of the tag that includes the model number and the serial number. Huh? I gave them all those numbers along with the part numbers that I need. Do they not believe me? Do they not think that I gave them the right numbers?What a pain. Had I known this I wouldn't have purchased a Eureka vac at all.",

Very lightweight and the perfect size. And I like the on /off button is separated from the power level button. And the LED light on the front. Easy to see the tiny dust on the floor.",
