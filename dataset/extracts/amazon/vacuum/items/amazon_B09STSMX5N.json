                "reviewText": "I love this little vacuum. It's so light-weight and easy to use. The handle pops out easily. The roller attachment is a little difficult to take off and put back on, but I get it done eventually. So far, I've mostly used it for floors and it does a great job. The dust container is small, of course, so I have to dump it after every room, but that's a reflection of the size of the tool and really can't be helped. As some have said, the cord is on the short side too, but I can get one largish room done without moving the plug. It's worth it to have the extra power provided by home electricity instead of weak batteries.We have an office in a nearby town and we didn't want to buy a new vacuum just for that little space, so this vacuum is PERFECT. I can just pick it up, toss it in the back of my car, and take it out at the office and use it there, then reverse the process and bring it home. So lightweight and easy to move it around.I believe someone said something about the pet hair being blown all over the place by the air vents, but I have not had that problem AT ALL. My dog is half german shepherd and let me tell you, she SHEDS. This vacuum sucks up all that hair so easily I'll probably never use the broom again! lolFabulous value for the money so far.",

E punto mas negativo es que el cepillo giratorio del accesorio de barredora se atasca en los tapetes de pelo corto, aspira bien el tapete pero el cepillo se atasca y no gira, para volverlo a habilitar he tenido que desmontar el accesorio y volverlo a colocar. Hace poco ruido, es muy ligera y el cabezal telescopico la hace llegar a todos rincones. Por el precio me parece una buena compra para departamentos y espacios peque\u00f1os",
