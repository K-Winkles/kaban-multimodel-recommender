                "reviewText": "I haven't tried a Hoover vacuum before so I was initially sceptical. Much to my surprise, this vacuum is awesome.It was easy to assemble within a few minutes and the manual had step by step instructions. It's moderate in weight. I have stairs in my house so carrying it up the stairs was a mini workout but I have no complaints.It's not hard to push when in operation and it glides smoothly over carpet and hard floors. The swivel of the vacuum movesinto angled corners of a room effortlessly to reach smaller, odd shaped areas.I like that it can be used on carpet and hard floors. I don't need multiple devices for my floors anymore. It's all in one!The light on the front of the vacuum helps you see more details of the floor. No matter what time of day or night you vacuum, it's like a bright night light.I also like the wand (handle) that is useful for vacuuming in places not on the floor. I have high ceilings in my house and lots of windows, so being able to use the wand feature for high and low reach areas off the floor makes my cleaning tasks easier and less time consuming.The extra accessories are a nice benefit to your vacuum options.The cup is easy to access and detach at the click of a button for dirt removal and the filters are easy to access for cleaning. I like that you don't need to use a screwdriver to removeany screws for the cup or filters. It's made with simplicity in mind.The suction is powerful. It sucks up particles on my floors instantly. There are two suction options of high or low that my other vacuums didn't provide.The vacuum is slender and is about 46\" in height. I have mine stored in my hall closet.I'm a happy Hoover user and recommend this product to anyone who wants convenience, quality, and to save time and energy.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to put together.. and it does work good.. I am happy that they give you an extra filter.. But not everything is as easy as they state..We vacuumed my floor, and it picked up some hair when it did.. I found that some of the hair went up into the metal screen where the filter is, and did not come out when the dirt canister was emptied.. I had to stick something in there to pull it down.. So it is not always a 1 button push to get it empty..The 2 attachments go on to this little + shaped piece for storage.. I am not impressed with this.. While they do stay in place, they would be way too easy to knock off if taking it up stairs, etc.. Why I really have a problem here.. If those fell off while taking it down a set of stairs, you could trip on them.. This is why they need a slightly better securement of these 2 attachments..The quick start guide attached to the handle makes it look like you use one of the attachments where the long handle attachment goes.. They need to fix that..The little brush attachment that is about 3 or 4 inches wide.. That would be great for getting in between things like a table and a bed.. That is, if it could be angled at a good angle.. It is made for hand use only.. The part of it where the handle attaches is only at about a 15 degree angle.. Because of this, if you wanted to use the long extension and use this, the handle would have to be held about 1 foot off of the floor for it to be used.. good if you are trying to get under a bed.. Bad if you are trying to get in between furniture.. This is why I say, it is really only good for hand use only, with no extensions.. It would be great if they could tilt where the vacuum suction hose is to be more like 30 or 45 degrees.. That would make it so that it could be used in many more situations..Overall, it does work good.. The attachments and pieces are easy to take apart, and switch between.. The vacuum does an excellent job on the floor.. The power button is in a nice place that makes it easy to use too. So my only 2 complaints are.. How things like hair are sucked up onto the metal strainer filter cover, and not as easy to clean out as a single button push like they make it sound.. and that the smaller attachment would be better if the hose attachment part was closer to a 30 or 45 degree angle..",

                "reviewText": "I think it is very hard to buy a vacuum these days. There are so many different models and it is difficult to compare all the various features. This vacuum has everything I need and then some. It is a decent size - it's smaller than my old one but much more efficient and easier to handle. This model has a lot of great features. I like being able to maneuver more around corners with this one. It seems very powerful. Another super nice thing is the dual brushes on the front. These really help to pick up stuff. One thing that's good to know is this picks up even small bits of things like fur. I have pets and this is ideal for getting stubborn pieces up. The hepa filter is great - I don't notice any dust at all coming out when I use it. I ended up choosing this model mainly because it is versatile on various surfaces. I have hard floors, tile, rugs, and one room with carpet. This vacuum works on all of them. Plus it has a deluxe attachment for upholstery and stairs, which is excellent.I hadn't purchased a new vacuum in a number of years and was really surprised by the high price tags on all of them. This one is about the average cost, and for what you get, I am very impressed. I am extremely happy with this new Hoover vacuum and I think it will last a long time.",
