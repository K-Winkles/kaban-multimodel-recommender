I only loved it due to the heavy duty suction and leaving 'great' lines in carpet. I wanted a new canister but was unable to find one with a power roller/brush I bought a Bissell something upright, broke on first use, returned. So, I was once again searching for a vacuum. I find this one for 150.00...it has metal wands, metal bottom, a power roller/brush (not self propelled but...) I decided to try this. It arrived within 2 days, it was easy to put together. I have vacuumed my entire house. I have small home and only needed to unplug once and move to another socket once, so the cord is super long for me. I must say, I am impressed. Now, I can't see how much is sucked up into bag, I will definitely check. I was able to vacuum all area rugs on '1' setting btw. So far, so good. Well worth the money.. I have literally had it less than an hour.",

                "reviewText": "I love vacuums. I\u2019m a neat freak at heart, but with the kids and animals at the age they\u2019re are, it isn\u2019t gunna happen. As long as my floors are clean though, I feel like I\u2019m at least kind of on top of it.I\u2019ve had 2 Dysons, 2 Sharks, a few Hoover, Bissel, etc. My husband and kids refuse to learn not EVERYTHING should be sucked up with a vacuum, so none of them last very long. It\u2019s mostly cheaper to buy a new vacuum than try to repair one of those.I got this for my downstairs carpeted areas that get destroyed by kid mung, muddy dog hair, hay bits brought in from outside\u2026my Shark Navigator Lift-Away was not cutting it. Vacuumed very slowly with the Shark before I pulled this out, and holy crap the stuff it sucked out of there was mind blowing.I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s close to Sanitaires $350 commercial vac, but it does a surprisingly good job for the price. Being able to fix it myself is another huge plus.It\u2019s for vacuuming carpets. It doesn\u2019t work on hard floor as you can\u2019t turn the brush roll off. It doesn\u2019t have attachments, but there\u2019s less things to potentially break and a cheap handheld vac could fill that void-for as well as it does with carpet it\u2019s worth it.It does well with large area rugs, but not smaller doorway sized ones, just sucks them up.It\u2019ll take forever to fill the bag before needing to empty. The edge game isn\u2019t great (again, use a handheld), it\u2019s heavier and harder to push than a canister vac, but that\u2019s because it has better suction-it isn\u2019t \u201chard\u201d by any means, just different.Love it, would buy again in a heartbeat.",

As a household with multiple dogs, it was perfect for pet hair and everyday life messes. Super easy to empty the bag and clean it out. We noticed the belt/brush roller wasn't turning about 2 weeks ago and subsequently was not sucking anything up on carpet. We immediately checked all areas that could possibly need maintenance. We emptied the bag (even though it did not need it) and we replaced the belt, and yet still the belt/brush rollers wouldn't turn. We're at a loss and frustrated that a vaccuum we spent this much money on doesn't even last 2 years! Super unhappy!!!!!!!",

The last one was horrible, very loud, and was designed to clog on every use. I gave it away and ordered this, which reminds me of the days when things worked as intended. I am not disappointed, this vacuum delivers as advertised and blew me away on first use. If I ever have to replace it I may upgrade to a better Sanitaire, but I will never buy any other type. If I want a hose and attachments, I use a shop vac for those purposes. Combo products typically are not very good at anything they do. This is for rugs and carpets and it's great at that!",
