I wasn't impressed with what I was seeing and being new to the game, not understanding a lot.When I saw the Moolan vacuum mop and was able to understand the description and such, and the customer reviews I was very impressed. I decided to go ahead and buy it.After using it the first time I had a question, not a problem, and sent a message to the service center.They responded with the answer within a few hours. I was amazed, I thought it would be a few days.This is customer service above and beyond. The stick vac is doing excellent picking up debris and dog hair. I very happy with my purchase and the help I received from Customer Service.I will recommend this vacuum to everyone!",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for a nice rechargeable and light vacuum. We looked at several brands most of them on the $200.00 range and more. And we stumbled upon the Moolan vacuum for less than $100.00. The reviews were good and I said, I don't have anything to loose. What can I said... I'm very impressed with the performance and how easy is to use. For the money and performance I cannot find a better vacuum. Please be aware if you use the vacuum on high power, the battery will last less than 30 minutes. I have been looking for an extra battery with no luck but I hope the manufacturer will make it available at some point.",

                "reviewText": "I hate to vacuum. In an effort to avoid this odious task, I\u2019ve purchased a couple of robot vacuums in the past. They work pretty well, but leave something to be desired. They\u2019re always getting stuck or choking on a kid\u2019s toy or otherwise making themselves more of a pain than just vacuuming myself. And so I was back to doing the thing I hate.Enter this stick vacuum.Now, while nothing will make me enjoy vacuuming, this Moolan cordless stick vacuum helps eliminate some of the things about vacuuming I hate the most. I\u2019m really impressed with it!It\u2019s light\u2014No struggling up and down stairs with a heavy vacuum. That\u2019s pretty awesome!It\u2019s cordless\u2014No tripping over cords and pulling the plug out of its socket!It\u2019s (relatively) quiet\u2014This makes a lot less noise than either our upright corded vacuum or our robots!A few things to keep in mind:\u2014I\u2019m not sure how long the battery with run this vacuum before having to be recharged. I\u2019ve easily gotten through three rooms and only lost less than half the charge according to the display.\u2014It only comes with one battery, so you won\u2019t be able to swap out a fresh one when you\u2019re out of charge. You\u2019ll have to wait four or five hours to recharge.\u2014The dust receptacle isn\u2019t huge. Depending how dusty your house if, you might be emptying it often.The bottom line: This is such a huge step up from traditional corded vacuums. Yes, I still hate vacuuming. But with this stick vacuum, I hate it an awful lot less! If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll find this a welcome change to the dreaded chore of vacuuming.",

                "reviewText": "I love the convenience of this lightweight cordless rechargeable battery powered vacuum. I like that it has an adjustable length handle and that the dust cup is easily removeable for easy cleanout. It has a surprising 6 level speed/power selection, which is move than necessary but it does make it easier to find the right level for area rugs which are always an issue with vacuums. Most of the time it gets used on the highest power setting for the best suction and performance which is adequate, but isn't as strong as our corded vacuum. But because of the convenience of cordless, we find we vacuum more often with this so the net result is the same. It's very easy to use and the beater bar attachment has LED lights that help to see, I don't like that it doesn't lock into an upright standing position, it's always loose. The beater bar is easily removable to remove fibers and hair that get stuck on it, and the vacuum comes with a special cleaning tool for that. The battery life is about 20 minutes per charge. It comes with a charging adapter that's specific to the vacuum and takes about an hour to reach a full charge, there's a display that shows charge level. Even though it doesn't have as strong a suction as our corded upright vacuum, it's adequate and we love the convenience of this ...so we use it more!",

                "reviewText": "I am so in love with this vacuum. I have a stick vacuum currently, but it is corded and very heavy to hang onto. I have mobility issues, so was looking for something that was lightweight and easy to use. This is perfect for my needs. This came with a mounting unit that I have attached to the wall in my linen closet, and when I am done vacuuming, it is very easy to store away. It has a good quality battery that charges fully and quickly. The battery is very easy to put on and takeoff. The attachments that came with the vacuum allow this to be used as a hand vacuum also. I have use some of the high dollar stick vacuums and while they worked well, they were way too expensive. This vacuum is affordable and within a good price range and does everything that those higher priced vacuums did. I especially appreciate how easy it is to go from my wood floors to my rug areas . This is very light and easy for me to use. I think it's probably the favorite vacuum I've owned. Definitely recommended to others.",

                "reviewText": "I have a similar vacuum, but it is corded. Decided to give this one a try even though I wasn't sure about the suction power. It did not disappoint and now it is my favorite thing. Turning it on is kind of different, but you get used to it. It always starts at the lowest power setting when you pull the trigger button. If you want full power you have to turn the dial. I guess it makes sense because it is on a battery, but I am a full power all the time kind of person. I vacuumed every carpeted room and underneath every piece of furniture and still had 2 bars of juice. So amazing and now I use it almost every day.My only sort-of con would be to have the wall mount be a charge point. You have to plug the vacuum in directly which means you have a cable hanging around. I still love it though.",
