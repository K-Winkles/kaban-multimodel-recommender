                "reviewText": "Okay I've been a huge fan of the stick cordless vacs from high end brands for a long time. Enough that we have about three of them in the house and one for the garage. However one of our originals is starting to die a slow death so I needed an alternative that didn't cost an arm in a leg as it was being used in a small area of the house. So I decided to pick this up to try since it was affordably priced, wasn't going to be our main vacuum and it had enough attachments.The vac was sent in a nice box with all of the attachments. Wife stated that she was surprised that it didn't come with more attachments however the second statement was that she really never used all the various ones and these looked to be the ones she'd actually use. The entire unit doesn't feel premium, rather budget friendly due to the price and would never be mistaken as high dollar. But it's fine for the price.The unit wasn't charged, so we fully charged it, it uses a barrel charger that you plug in and comes with a wall mount dock. It's not elegant as the dock screws into the wall and you have to manually plug in the power. No biggie at this price point I'm fine with that. We used floor cleaning attachment and like that it has a light on it and the three speed suction works well on our stained concrete floors. The one thing that may be gimmicky but neat is the LED light crevice tool. It's not super bright but it illuminates enough. We ended up vacuuming our downstairs on the medium setting and it worked well. The brush head is smaller than we're used to but that's not a terrible thing because it does get in the harder to reach areas where our larger one doesn't as easily.All in all we'll be putting it through it's paces for the next month and seeing if it's a nice low budget alternative. I'd recommend this for occasional or limited duty use but not for a total replacement vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "First off, unboxing this vacuum was like discovering a hidden gem. Every component was nestled snugly in custom foam forms, and each part was shielded with a protective sleeve. They even covered the wall charger with protective film, which, let's be honest, is like finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag\u2014a delightful little bonus.Now, let's talk about build quality, because oh boy, this thing feels like it was crafted by elves in some premium gadget workshop. The different configurations available are not just some marketing fluff; they genuinely add to its versatility. Picture this: you can switch from tackling a mountain of pet hair to delving into the dark corners of your living room with the ease of a cat leaping onto a windowsill.And the brush head? I expected some passive, spin-if-you're-lucky kind of deal, but nope. It's powered, thanks to connecting electrical leads along each component, giving you a cleaning experience that says, \"I mean business.\"Suction? We're talking 28Kpa-level suction on Max mode. In human language, that means it sucks up dirt and debris like a champ\u2014everything from pet hair to cat litter to the crumbs of your failed cooking experiments. All of this without feeling like you're lugging around a piece of heavy machinery; it's lightweight yet robust.The filtration system is not just a bunch of mesh thrown together; it\u2019s a bona fide HEPA filtration system. This thing traps particles like a pro goalie, making it easy to clean and reuse without sacrificing performance. And speaking of performance, 45 minutes of runtime is nothing to scoff at. That's nearly an episode of your favorite binge-worthy show, all while making your floors look like they were cleaned by a professional.Let's not forget the 1.2L dust cup; it\u2019s more like a chalice of cleanliness that you can empty at the touch of a button. We're talking convenience and capacity wrapped into one.So, if you want a premium cleaning experience without mortgaging your house, this is it. The DEVOAC S11 delivers way more than you'd expect for its price point. A solid 5/5, and that's not something I say lightly.",

                "reviewText": "Got tired of lugging our upright vacuum up and down the stairs, so picked this up for spot cleaning upstairs. Works great for that, and is very portable and lightweight. I'm just storing it away in my closet, where it can charge when not in use. Very easy to grab whenever I need to vacuum up something in my bedroom or bathroom. Does it's job well on both carpet and tile, easily sucking up pet hair and other miscellaneous messes. I like that it has different attachments and that the height can be easily adjusted.It's not as powerful as our corded, upright vacuum, but it's a fraction of the weight and much easier to maneuver around. I'll probably never use the upright attachments again -- so much easier to vacuum the stairs and any surfaces up off the ground with this unit.",
