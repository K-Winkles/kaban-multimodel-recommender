The battery is a real trooper, allowing me to navigate the mess even after an hour of use. The 5-layer filter does its job, tackling the daily dirt, though shaking it off can be a bit of a dusty shuffle. Suction power is solid - not a carpet superhero, but it gets the job done.Now, the telescopic tube and wall-friendly setup are absolute lifesavers in my home hustle. The flexible brush and LED lights might be a tad extra, but they add a bit of flair to the cleaning gig. In my house, you might find yourself emptying the dirt bin more often, but the no-fuss vibe totally balances it out. With a dog, kids, and a house that seems to grow messes overnight, this cordless vacuum is the hero that's making everyday chaos in my life feel much less stressful.Overall, I'm glad I bought this. Better than my old Dyson.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first cordless vac, and I have bought to use in my kitchen and family room. One has tiles and other has wooden floor. It works great on such floors. It is very light and is quite to work with. In fact I enjoy using this cordless vac. I am also cleaning my carpeted staircase using hand held with adapter supplied. It cleans well including dog hair. With other vacs the dog hair were difficult to clean but this one does the job. The battery life is decent too. I charge once a day to do my daily routine. Emptying the canister is easy. Even with low setting it cleans well. The adapters supplied help me to do small jobs like car cleaning, underneath sofa seats etc. I am happy with my purchase, and I strongly recommend it.",

Battery life is good for me to vacuum small areas. It is good for everyday cleaning around the kitchen and other areas for a quick clean up. That is what I basically needed it for. Maneuverability is good, it can get into the hard to reach places with a big sized one. It\u2019s a bonus that it can be used as handheld for cars.I have only used it on low so far. And even keeping it on low it picks up everything. The light at the front is very handy. I am able to see everything in the dark corners. I am satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Okay so, this vacuum is not HORRIBLE. But its not great. even on sale for 150$, I am returning it, because my 30$ vacuum I got at walmart in 2010 does a better job.I had high hopes for this vacuum, but it fell short. It has great maneuverability, and is light weight, but it sucks for suction, and barely picked up my dogs fur, and the dirt collection cup is so small, that what it does pick up, you have to empty the dang thing 4 times in 10 minutes.I did learn from this vacuum that I like the cordless, stick vacuum design and after this one didn't preform I found another option on sale at Canadian tire, and instantly went and picked it up at 75%off.I bought the new vacuum cleaner after I decided I would return this one (within 5 mintues), I had JUST vacuumed with this one, and the new one (Bissel IconPet) filled up with fur in literally 5 seconds on an area rug I had just done- and my dog wasn't even home to re-fill the rug with fur.Long story short- I think if you were doing extremely light cleaning, and using this as a quick clean up- it would be fine-ish - albeit rather expensive for what it does. If you actually are a human being and have messes- (ie bungalow, no mudroom, a husband in trades, kids and pet(s), cook a lot, etc) then I highly recommend avoiding purchasing this vacuum even though it seems like a great deal. TBH I am pretty sure the original price is a scam since there is no way that this is a 600$+ vacuum. As I said, my 30$ option from 2010 has more suction.Update: I got a letter in the mail from the company saying for a 5-star review, they would send me a 40$ Amazon gift card. So to be clear that is a 669.00 vacuum, supposedly on sale for 199.00 with 50$ off on top of that, and they can still send a 40$ gift card to people... A tad bit suspicious",

I love that the canister and filter is very simple and the hair and my cat's fur does not get tangled somehwere along the way and cleans off very easily.
