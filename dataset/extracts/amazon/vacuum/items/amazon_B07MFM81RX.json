With specially designed pet tools and powerful Wind Tunnel 3 technology, this vacuum removes stubborn pet hair on carpet and hard floors while tackling dirt and debris in every corner and crevice.

Troubleshoot: (1) Vacuum won\u2019t run - * Power cord not firmly plugged into outlet * Blown fuse or tripped breaker * Thermal Protector activated (2) Smoky / burning smell detected - * Belt broken or stretched * Brushroll is clogged (3) Vacuum is difficult to push or won\u2019t move forward - * Carpet height setting is incorrect * Brushroll is activated. Other troubleshoot solutions are available on user manual Pg-15.",

                "reviewText": "Hoover wind tunnel 3, Max Pet has most all of the features I wanted in an upright vacuum. The most important features were: one that would fluff up the carpet, and was heavy enough it would stay in place when using the hose. A bagless that was easy to take apart and put back together. And a big enough dust bin that I didn\u2019t have to empty it after vacuuming every room. This one has 12 amps that gives it plenty of power and the suction doesn\u2019t diminish as the dirt tank fills up. It\u2019s got a pedal to turn off the roller/beater bar, so it will vacuum hard floors without spitting dust around the floor. I wanted to mention that it DIDN\u2019T suck itself to the floor like a couple of reviews says it does. There is a dial to adjust the height. The 30 ft cord is the longest cord I\u2019ve ever had on a vacuum. It\u2019s bagless with a large bin. 1.5 liter. Not the biggest bin Hoover makes. But the biggest one I could find with the roller/beater bar control pedal. We have 2 hairy dogs, I vacuumed 4 large rooms and still had room for more dirt. It\u2019s fairly easy to push, for what it is. It\u2019s a monster vacuum weighing 18lbs. Great news, it rolls easier than I expected it would. Again, it has adjustable height, so when it seemed hard to push, I raised it up one notch. There\u2019s a 15\u2019 hose. With an extendable wand that disappointingly isn\u2019t quite long enough to use on the floor without bending over. But, I\u2019m using a longer wand from another vacuum. So, It\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. The clear plastic does show all the dirt though. Someone like me, going from a bagged version to a bagless version might not be used to seeing all the dirt and dog hair flying around. Although it was something we were all watching at first. Theres no bags to buy but the trade off is washing the dust bin. It\u2019s got a hepa and charcoal filter, that cannot be washed, but they don\u2019t need replaced very often according to the directions. And it\u2019s got a washable dirt filter that\u2019s a flat sponge like thing. So it will be easy to wash, but It wasn\u2019t dirty at all, so I didn\u2019t have to wash it this time. The reviews said it was too loud? It sounds normal to me. Yes, it\u2019s noisy, but not as loud as I thought it was going to be. The reviews said it\u2019s hard to push the release pedal. But this one is so easy I was using it barefoot. The reviews said it was hard to take apart. But this is the easiest vacuum to take apart. A couple of reviews said they received s different model, so I double checked on the box before opening. I received exactly what I ordered. I believe the reviews must have been for a different vacuum even though they were shown under this model.",

I made the switch to Hoover and I couldn't be happier with this vacuum. The suction is better then Bissell, but it's still kind of the same weight as Bissell as far as going up and down stairs. But it's great for getting dust in the corner's, but the angle brush is something you can do without. I'm definitely not a fan of that attachment because when I try to vacuum my ceiling fan blades the angle brush goes from angle to flat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this same vacuum 4 - 5 years ago. I won't buy anything else as long as I have carpet, but you know how that goes, over time things become less reliable and more cheaply made so let's see how it goes. Still heavy to take upstairs and downstairs but that's what the three men in my house are for, lol. Since my cats are downstairs for the most part, that's where I mostly use it. Really is excellent for getting up hairs, especially the roller attachment on cat trees. I empty the case and wipe with chlorox wipes after each use.Pros:-Suction is still great. Best of any vacuum I've ever had.-Still the longest cord, I can go almost the whole length of my downstairs before having to plug into another room. Common sense tip: keep the cord out of the way, don't run vacuum over your cord, it will strip the cord.-Still a washable filter. Helps to prevents odors.Cons-None of the attachments work really well for carpeted stairs. They need a flat hard trapezoid one. I have an attachment from a previous vacuum that fits, I use that.-Attaching the top and bottom of dirt case parts was annoying, causing the alignment to the base extremely difficult.-Not present in the last one: when you detach the hose to use attachments, previously vacuumed pet hair starts coming out of the suction hole. There should be some sort of cap to put there when. I just stick one of the attachments in there but it doesn't cover the hole completely. Going to use tape going forward. While not a deal breaker, it really is a design flaw (this is why 4 stars this time around)-The small round silicone flap covering the on-off button is annoying, you have to press the cap in a particular spot for it to turn on. The flap also was one of the first things to shred on my last vacuum. Also a design flaw.-the plastic used this time around seems to be a dust magnet, this model ends up with dust and hair clinging to the outside when using the attachments. I did notice the non-base parts were lighter, cheapy-feeling, when putting together. I will recheck to see if there's any suction leaks.-more expensive than the last time I bought it, almost 50% moreThe last one lasted me about 4 years. Let's see if this one does.",
