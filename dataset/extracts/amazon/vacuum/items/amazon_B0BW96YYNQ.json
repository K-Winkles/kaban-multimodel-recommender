For each product, we strive to meet the technical requirements as much as possible and perfectly adapt it to your various home cleaning needs. Why equip the H-611 stick/hendheld vacuum cleaner with 9 non-woven filters instead of HEPA filters? After research and repeated testing by Hihhy's R&D team, we decided to use a more efficient washable & replaceable non-woven filter to reduce the problem of reduced suction power due to clogging of the filter. Where can I get the replacement filters? It can be found on the product page or in the Hihhy brand store. Hihhy proveide a one year warrant and we can provide you with a free replacement filter during the warrant period. Please feel free to let us know if you need the replacement filter.",

                "reviewText": "Love it! The box it came in had some indents but that\u2019s probably because of the delivery process, the product itself seems to be unharmed so far. It\u2019s not too big nor too small which makes it perfect to both store & use. There are also multiple attachments so swapping them for different surfaces was great. I only had a slight issue with the line of blue brush thing on the bigger attachment, it kept falling off but it\u2019s attachable if you rly try. I do wish this same exact version had a cordless/more portable version. For some reason I thought it was one where you charge it but then is able to use it without the cord after, that\u2019s my fault for mistaking that. But other than that it\u2019s perfect & has rly good suction especially for dust & hair.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the vaccum for just about a week and used it only once to clean all my rooms and just wanted to add my two cents regarding first impressions. I realize all the stick vaccums in this price range are basically clones made by probably the same few facilities in China and sold under different brands. The weight cutting (and cost cutting) comes from using thin lightweight materials that may be lightweight but not necessarily strong. Having said that, this is a well put together little vaccum. The pieces do fit together tightly and it does its job well. The thing that makes this one stick out is the 600W motor which is the most of the ones that I saw before buying. The ones from big brand names (Bissel, Eureka) may be around the same price or even cheaper but the wattage is half of this motor and may not have much suction power. So this one has some decent suction, plus the extra long power cord and is maneuverable. I think that just puts this one over the top compared to the other clones, the power, the extra long cord , multiple attachments and extra spare filters. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it doesn't stand up on its own, even though there is a little clip on the base for that purpose to support it, but that's not a big deal since it just stands against the wall in the closet. But overall it met expectations and it does its job well.",

I\u2019m debating keeping it because it is absolutely amazing. I am a clean freak and I own a Miele (the Rolls Royce of vacuums), and I think this could give it a run for its money. It\u2019s great if you have a larger home with multiple levels I will keep this one as my playroom/quick kitchen clean ups. The power on this this is amazing for how small and cheap it feels (but it is anything but cheaply run mechanically). I also love how they have a pack of filter changes so you can throw away the dirty filters, no other vacuums I have come with that. I have a roomba upstairs, my Shark navigator for deep cleaning, my Miele for my everyday big rug cleans and this thing might be my #1. 10/10 I can\u2019t even believe the power of this thing (the canister in the picture is my first use of just my playroom and my pretty clean kitchen floor and I don\u2019t have pets).",
