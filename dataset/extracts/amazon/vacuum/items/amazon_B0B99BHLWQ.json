                "reviewText": "This thing is infinitely easier than sweeping or vacuuming with my old clunky Hoover. The battery doesn't seem to last a terribly long time but it's more than enough for me to vacuum my entire apartment (one bedroom, kitchen, small bathroom, and a good-sized living room). It's very easy to do a quick floor clean and then empty the container and charge the battery up for next time! I'm finding this perfect for the cat hair and litter bits that end up everywhere. It is lightweight, easy to assemble and use, lightweight and surprisingly quiet. The head is also very swively, which is nice for corners and tight spaces. I don't think this would work very well for deep or thick carpets but it seems to work well on my bathroom rug and it is fantastic for hard flooring.",

I can get under a rolling cabinet that is less than 5 inches off the ground-I never knew there was so much start under there. I just wish that it would stand up straight for storage . I\u2019ve never found the sheet rock wall mounts for portable vacuums very durable so this one falls a lot. I would think that it would be an easy design fix. All in all for the Price can\u2019t beat it. Looking forward to see how long it lasts.",

                "reviewText": "Hi! I am a Law of Attraction Author and Coach so I normally wouldn't write a review like this; however, my intention is to explain what's going on so hopefully the company will reach out and tell me how to fix the E7 error code making my vacuum (bought in March 2023) unusable. I am hoping it's an easy fix and then I will write a review about how much I love this vacuum, which I did, until I got the E7 error code which I and my five kids have googled in a fruitless effort to figure out how to fix. I also tried to contact the company for guidance but was unable to find how to do so. It's frustrating because I have not used the vaccum for months because it doesn't work because of E7. So I got a few months of use out of it and loved it and now it is useless. Hoping someone sees this and tells me how to fix it as if not, I do not recommend this product as it only worked for a few months before I got the code. I did really like how light it was. The charge definitely wore out quickly but I could vacuum a few rooms and then recharge which is just fine. Fingers crossed the company steps up and tells me how to fix then I will write a different positive review.

                "reviewText": "This is the quietest stick vac I have ever used, seen, or heard. At full power, I could run it while the house was sleeping and not wake up anyone and that's saying quite a bit since most are very light sleepers.Let's start with the Vac itself. The touch display is informative showing the battery charge remaining and the operating mode/speed. Control of the speed is easy with multiple levels available between MIN & MAX. The positioning of MIN & MAX is intuitive to me as a Western user with MIN to the left and MAX to the right. The same holds for loosening and tightening the filter and internal baffles. Left to loosen and right to tighten.I did need to return the first unit I received because the powerhead did not seat completely into the end of the downtube and lock in place. Third-party accessories did fit and lock in place, however. The replacement has the exact opposite issue where the provided powerhead attached and locked in place, but third-party attachments will not.The suction is excellent on all surfaces and with all attachments and the unique \"Auto\" setting does work well to adjust the speed of the motor and amount of suction based on the resistance from the surface it's being used on.The unit that I'm reviewing is currently showing as unavailable so I'm not sure where in their \"Ultimate\" line this review will end up. Hopefully, by the features I've described, you'll be able to make that determination after reading the features of the advertised unit.",

I bought this vac because the reviews were good an compared it to the Dyson. II am usually very positive in my reviews but this product was less than what I expected. It was easy to put together and I charged the battery overnight. I used it this morning and was not impressed. The suction is poor even on high. I have hardwood floors and no pets. I vacuum at least twice a week with the stick vac. This vac is poor at picking up dust and I had to clear the filter with a small amount of hair. I use my stick vac several times a week inbetween usings my corded vac and wanted a vac that could do what my Dyson did. This vac does not get into corners and crevices. The side suction is poor and does not clear dust near the baseboards. I was not impressed at all with this vac. I am fussy about my cleaning tool and want them to have high performance. It was way less expensive than the Dyson but the performance it that much less. I ordered a new Dyson today. If you are looking for a Dyson replacement, this is not the vac you want.",

                "reviewText": "I needed to replace my cordless cleaner since I mistakenly washed the powerhead in water so I was without a vacuum cleaner for about 6 weeks. I loved my previous cleaner and was upset at myself for ruining it so when I had a little extra money I purchased this one, which was on sale at the time and came to a little over a hundred dollars. I would have ordered the same one as my previous cleaner but could not afford it this time, so I settled for this one.The first disappointment is that the cup fills extremely fast and it is very annoying to empty it in the middle of cleaning so usually I wait until it is fully charged again and empty it at that time, before cleaning again, which leads to the second disappointment which is that the charge does not last as long as my last one did, maybe half an hour, which is definitely not long enough to do a thorough cleaning.The third disappointment is that my carpet is indoor outdoor so when I put it on the carpet option, it snags my carpet pretty much the whole time I am cleaning but need that option, as the lower setting does not have enough suction power...so like I said, better than nothing but as soon as I can afford it, I will order the other brand I had before.I am wishing now that I had kept my corded back up cleaner that did an excellent job. I ended up giving that to a family member who needed one and afterwards, he complained about it and only used it once but too difficult to get it back here now due to transportation issues and storing it is an issue, as I have limited space here and also, since going cordless, I never want to go back to using a corded vacuum cleaner again but that one did a way better job...so what I am saying is that you should NOT waste your money.",
