Only a slightly better suction, not even noticable until I did a ping pong ball test, and this one barely out performed the cheap $65 vacuum. I the test I turned both on high with a ping pong ball I the middle to see which would win by keeping the ball.So I guess it's worth it for the BF $99 proce, but definitely not a penny more.We also have a shark we bought at Sam's club, and that's tremendously more powerful.This is not in the same category as Shark, and certainly not Dyson. Just a cheap (at least once/year cheap) substitute. \ud83d\ude2d",
