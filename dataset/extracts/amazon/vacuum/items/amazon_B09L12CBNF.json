                "reviewText": "This super compact vacuum is even better than expected! I've only used it one time for about an hour and a half in every little nook and cranny in my house and I'm already sold. I live in a 1200sq ft 2 bedroom apartment with hard vinyl flooring. The main reason I got this vacuum is for quick and easy daily cleaning of A LOT of pet hair/dander, allergens and cat litter.. and so far it tackles those tasks with ease. I'm very satisfied after the initial cleaning session.First of all, it's super light which one one of the most important features for me as I have a bad back and can't use my $400 Shark vacuum for longer than 15-20min without my back absolutely killing me. It's also going to be a perfect little vacuum for my 5 and 6 year olds to use (who are just learning how to do chores). Upon opening it, the size and extremely light weight was humorous and it almost made the vacuum look and feel like a cheap toy BUT it seems pretty well put together and the versatility and suction power is actually pretty powerful on this little guy.Second, it's super compact. I love that it takes up barely any space when storing. For reference it's so small you could even fit it inside of a small cabinet or under the sink! Because it's small and so compact this vacuum pretty much reaches everywhere you need it to.Third, the attachments are great and very versatile. The vacuum has six different forms which adapt to every cleaning task with ease. The main \"floor brush\" handles very nicely and you can choose to put one, two or no pole attachments in-between the brush and the vacuum to adjust the length. It's great for maneuvering underneath and around furniture, including couches, chairs, beds, bureaus, vanities, shelves, TV stands, large appliances, etc. I was easily able to get into corners, tight spaces and crevices that I could rarely ever reach with my shark vacuum. I also absolutely LOVE those little bristles on both sides of long edges of the floor brush because they catch and trap every little piece of fur and dust that evades the front of the vacuum, the bristles even fit under that tiny space in-between the baseboards and the floors! It honestly made cleaning so easy and fun! I only meant to test it out for a few minutes and it quickly turned into an hour and a half full cleaning session.Fourth, it's GREAT at picking up pet hair and litter.. I have two cats, a dog and a chinchilla who all shed daily all over my furniture. And that little canister holds a LOT of pet hair and litter. The cats track litter freaking everywhere, the dog has a bad habit of trying to eat the cat poop and hiding it in his bed so he also tracks litter everywhere and the chinchilla takes dust (volcanic ash) baths so she's always kicking up a crazy amount of dust on the regular. She also kicks her litter/bedding out of her large triple story enclosure constantly as well so it's an ongoing process sweeping around her cage multiple times per day.I only emptied the vacuum once about halfway thru the 90min and honestly I probably could have gone the entire hour and a half without emptying it it all. The 5-stage filtration system seems to work very well at collecting and separating pet hair and the like. I was very impressed with how much pet hair this vacuum effortlessly sucks up.Now for the critiqueshhhhyyy.. Overall, my only critiques at the moment are:-the vacuum does not stand upright on its own so you either have to just hold it or lean it against a stable surface or corner-there aren't any cord hooks on the vacuum or the holder to wrap/store the cord around-it doesn't seem to work my bathroom rugs very well.My cats litter box is currently in the bathroom and whenever they do their business they kick up a bunch of litter.. Every. Single. Time. As I stated before the main reason I got this vacuum is for quick and easy daily cleaning of A LOT of pet hair/dander, allergens and cat litter so I was slightly disappointed that it was so difficult m to maneuver on this one surface. However, it is marketed as a hard floor and low-pile carpet vacuum and that bathroom rug is a high-pile rug so it's not surprising that it doesn't easily maneuver on this surface.All and all this is a fantastic little vacuum and I'm highly pleased with this purchase. I can definitely see myself using this daily to quickly and effortlessly clean the litter, pet hair, dander and allergens from my home.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great stick vacuum for its intended purpose.Here is the situation: my darling husband has a professional backpack vacuum cleaner and vacuums the house once a week or so. I used my old Hoover for in between times, as we track dirt in from outside, and other occasional uses.This replaced the old Hoover. I love that it is very lightweight and easy to use - but great suction for cleaning up dirt and debris. My husband doesn't usually vacuum the spider webs around the windows and ceilings, so this is ideal because it is so light. I like that it is corded, as I don't like to deal with charging a battery. Just plug in and go. I also like that you empty the receptacle instead of replacing expensive disposable bags. And bags were so annoying to deal with. And I like that it comes with two tubes; you can use the attachments without the tube, with one tube or extend with two tubes to reach the cobwebs on the ceiling. Versatile.The test was that I left my old Hoover out in the living room and put this stick vacuum in the closet where I normally kept the Hoover. When I needed to vacuum the entrance mat and other area rugs, I actually walked past the Hoover to use this! So it's a keeper!I have hardwood floors, tile, vinyl, area rugs and low-pile wall-to-wall carpet. It works well on all - but, for me it is only for in-between the usual vacuuming and I usually use the smaller square brush or crevice tool. I will say that it is not ideal if it is your only vacuum cleaner and you have a largish house.Regarding the receptacle: another reviewer stated that it is messy to empty. I did not find it so. Even if you unlatch it upside down (but who would do that?), the debris is held in by four pieces. Yes, one should empty it after each use and also rinse those four pieces, to save the motor from the fine abrasive (destructive) dust particles that accumulate. (By the way, there is a spare sponge filter and HEPA filter in case they are still drying and you need to use the vacuum again.)We actually ended up buying two of these vacuums, as they are such a great price. I even got a coupon on one! So now I have one by the back door and one by the front door.Bottom line: read the reviews, check out the videos, and compare the power and vacuum suction (and price!) with other products. I highly recommend!",
