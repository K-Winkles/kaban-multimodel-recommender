Its nice that the floor attachment swivles but sometimes it swivled too much-but thats no biggie. Piece if cake to put together. The cord is LONG, almost too long-i only have a small apartment-but again no biggie. The cup is small, which i knew, so youll need to empty it after every use. Im very optimistic about this purchase. I will do another review after having it for a few weeks. Looking good so far!",

                "reviewText": "A lot of people collect things, whether it be coins, baseball cards, etc. I know this is strange but I like vacuums. Not to the point of having more than 7 but I am always looking for the next best vacuum. I have from the top-of-the-line to bottom of the line. I usually like to make a video, but it was impossible to make myself a video of me using this vacuum because my children were home. I do not post them, ever. I put together this vacuum and the first one I wanted to try, was vacuuming the hardwood floors downstairs. I have many rooms downstairs that are hardwood floors and only my family room and three season room are carpeted. Once I put it together, I could not stand it up. It is too top-heavy and therefore would come crashing down onto the floor. The pro about this vacuum is that it does have great suction. It was able to clean my hardwood floors and easily glide over to my family room. The suction was strong enough that it picked up the oriental rug that I have in the entryway. That was impressive. I then wanted to do my stairs which are hardwood a runner. I could not take the bottom part off. It certainly did not glide off, and I tried many ways to try to take it off without ruining the vacuum. I finally was able to. Actually, my teenage son did it for me. I am not a week person. It was extremely difficult. Once again, it did have great suction, but I could not take off the stair extension. This found to be a large con. If someone lived in a smaller home or apartment and they don\u2019t have a lot of storage, and was unable to take apart the vacuum, that would have to lay it down somewhere because of how top heavy it is. I have clients who live in Manhattan where their condo is less than 900 ft.\u00b2 but it is a multimillion dollar home for them. They have to come up with ingenious ways to store multiple things that I can easily put in my utility room. I would give this vacuum 2 1/2 stars if I could. It\u2019s great for suction, but so hard to interchange the attachments.",

The portable one runs 130W and this one runs 350W in terms of power. I think this explains the great suction. Even more, it looks more expensive than it actually is. Very worthy product.",

                "reviewText": "Nifty little vacuum! It has some quirks but it\u2019s a decent value and does work well. Out of the box you do have to assemble and attach the tube pieces together. They don\u2019t especially fit well or click when you put them together - you really have to just push them and I didn\u2019t feel like I could ever get them to snap all the way together. The machine is easy to operate with the single power button. It was a little tricky to get the bin chamber off the bin to empty the dust. One thing I love is how narrow and thin the tube and the attachments are. I can reach into my smaller spots than my Dyson. Shortening the length isn\u2019t easy because the pieces don\u2019t assemble easily. The machine isn\u2019t especially have y to hold in my opinion. The size is pretty petite compared to my other vacuums. The suction is good! I had low expectations but the suction was pretty efficient. The only accessory I didn\u2019t love is the larger 3 in 1 dust head. It sort of swivels and does its own thing and is lightweight and difficult to control. The cord is nice and long and it does include hooks for wrapping the cord. Overall a nifty vacuum. It isn\u2019t perfect and wouldn\u2019t replace a full size vacuum in our home but we have this on our second floor and it\u2019s a lifesaver to easily vacuum dust or small messes. Is much more powerful than I expected it to be!",

I do not like wireless vacuum because I don\u2019t like to charge in between when I am cleaning. It has very powerful suction.Hence for someone looking for a Dyson style wired vacuum for a really good price, this is the right product.",
