It doesn't have a place to wrap the cord up and it's suction is enough to \"get by. \"I bought it bc i left my big heavy one at a cleaning job. I didn't have a lot of money and i bought this one. Stairs are no problem.. it's so frigging light weight.It doesn't give you\" vacuum lines\"But it works.No one has complained about my vacuuming so far. Lol It's so easy to put together. It comes with 2 easy to clean filters.The cord is 26 fti think. The one i got. I think it's a decent size cord.No real complaints.I feel like it's worth it for the money i paid to be honest.",

I told my friends and family about it, especially those with cats as it was wonderful for picking up cat litter. However, about a month ago, the suction power just minimized and now I can't pick up a fuzzy on the floor, let alone any litter. I would love to get another one, hoping mine was just faulty, but I'm just not sure.",

Easy to use, lightweight and love that you can wash the filter and reuse (hoping will extend the filter life) comes with extra filter and few attachments. I\u2019ve only used on tile floor & area rug and it works really good. Long power cable so don\u2019t have to keep changing outlets. Not sure it would be so good if home has a lot carpet but like I said it seems good for my area rugs. I\u2019m a little ocd so when I empty out the cylinder I also empty out the filter and clean by rinsing with warm water after each use so I\u2019m sure that helps - only takes a minute to do and drys out overnight. Really good value for money, so give it a try! :)",
