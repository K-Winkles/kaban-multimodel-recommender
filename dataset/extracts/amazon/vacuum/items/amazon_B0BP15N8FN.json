                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this vacuum for 5 months now and it\u2019s awesome! Very versatile and light-weight. I use it all over the house. If you use the max suction, the battery life is pretty short, but I haven\u2019t found that I really need to use it on max much. Usually will use it on max on my living room rug. Otherwise, I usually just stick to the minimum suction and I can get a decent amount of uses between charges. The typical square footage I use it for is probably about 1200. Maneuverability is amazing! I can easily get around furniture, corners, and high to reach places when I use it for dusting.As for storage, I usually keep it broken down just to make it quick and easy to grab the specific attachments I need for whatever I need it for. It hardly takes up any space at all.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best vaccume i ever had me and my grandson love vaccuming with this piece of eqipment. The suction power is great and it has 3 levels it is very portable and has three attachments it also has a very long lasting batteryAfter testing out several different models, I can confidently say that this is the best option on the market even better than dyson. This vacuum is incredibly powerful and effective, easily picking up dirt and debris from both carpets and hard floors.What sets this vaccume apart from other vacuums is its Lift-Away feature, which allows you to detach the canister from the base and clean hard-to-reach areas like stairs and upholstery with ease. The vacuum also comes with a variety of attachments, including a crevice tool and pet power brush, making it a great choice for homes with pets.Another great feature of the voweek is its HEPA filtration system, which captures lots of dust and allergens in your home. This is especially important for people with allergies or respiratory issues.Overall, I highly recommend the voweek Vacuum for anyone in need of a powerful, versatile, and effective cleaning tool for their home.",

I have three indoor dogs and this does great collecting a lot of the hair and dust on a day-to-day before I deep clean on the weekend. Easy assemble, maneuvering, and empty out.CONS:Battery runs out quickly if one one of the higher suction levels. Vacuum can't stand on it's own, needs to lean (isn't very stable on it's own - flops over).So far I love it and use it daily to clean my rugs, vinyl flooring and couch. I just plug it in overnight so that it has a full battery when I need to use it and won't un out mid- vacuum.It does a wonderful job with cleaning up after my fur-babies.",

                "reviewText": "Whomever designed this vacuum took every clever design feature possible and utilized them perfectly in one vacuum. I used to hate vacuuming because our older Dyson is a heavy beast, corded and makes a horrible shrieking sound when placed in the upright position before being fully turned off. It works fine on carpets, but is nearly worthless on hardwood floors-didn't know that before we purchased it. We now live in a place that is 100% hardwood floors, so the Shrieking Behemoth isn't cutting it.I'm on the taller side, and unfortunately the majority of cleaning equipment (unless it's designed for professional janitors) is usually too short for me, resulting in me stooping and crouching while trying to clean, and then my back aching afterwards. This vacuum is *just right* with an extendable neck that is tall enough for me not to hunch while vacuuming. I am completely delighted. It has three modes of suction power, with a helpful little digital display that tells you how much of the battery power remains as you go.I can clean our stairs! I can reach under the center of our bed and get at the dust there without getting on my hands and knees! The overall weight of the vacuum is so light, that I can cover the majority of our floors very quickly. A miracle has occurred and now I actually enjoy vacuuming. The head on the extendable tube swivels at two joints, making it really easy to maneuver while in use-you rarely (if ever) have to pick it up to adjust it while vacuuming. Wow.The trigger style switch also makes it very easy to stop the vacuum instantly if you accidentally vacuum rubber bands, twist ties, or the usual things that can destroy a vacuum and strain the motor into oblivion.The canister is small, but ingeniously there is a built in hair guard on the central vacuum core-no more performing surgery on the vacuum just to get it ready to use. Easy to empty, easy to take care of. I have long hair and I cannot tell you how often I've had to perform surgery on the Shrieking Behemoth to get it usable and to shriek more quietly.The head of this vacuum is very easy to disassemble to remove long hairs from the floor brushes, then reassemble, perfectly designed.The only CON is that the vacuum's battery takes hours to recharge. I mean at least 3 hours. Being a disorganized human, I just plug it in after use and let it fully recharge before putting it away, keeping it ready to be used at a moment's notice.Get this vacuum. Your back will thank you, your housemates will thank you, and your pets will thank you.",
