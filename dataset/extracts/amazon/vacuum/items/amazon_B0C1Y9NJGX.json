It\u2019s very effective at picking up trash on my hardwood floors. My dogs track in a lot of grass and debris from the yard. I use it almost daily. I like that it will easily fit under the furniture due to the low profile of the floor attachment. It\u2019s very lightweight and easy for me to use. I can quickly use it to pick up the trash on the floor, dump the dust cup and recharge for the next use. It picks up everything on my floor using the low setting. I\u2019ve never had to use the high setting. I\u2019m surprised by the suction it has. It\u2019s a great vacuum and the price is a deal.",

                "reviewText": "With dogs coming in and out, we\u2019re always having to sweep or vacum. Ever since Swifter stop making their cordless swifter sweeper we\u2019ve been having to take out our vacuum cleaner each time. Then we found this on line and decided to give it a go. And WOW I love it. It\u2019s so simple to use and it sucks up all the grass and hair off the floor perfectly. I refuse to sweep and vacuum 5x a day. With this we can take it out a dozen times very easily. It\u2019s so light weight and it charges quick and holds a charge. I was skeptical but this works perfectly for quick pick up action with out having to take out the broom or the vacuum cleaner. Worth every penny. And it was cheaper than the swifter sweeper we use to buy.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a cordless floor vacuum with a passive floor nozzle to pick up hair in my bathroom, and that\u2019s just what it does. Suction is just strong enough to do the job, with the upsides being quiet operation and light weight. It does not make the shrieking sound that most handhelds do; it\u2019s more of a muted high-pitched whine. The color is absolutely wonderful, and I will use it as a color sample when decorating. It comes with the bare minimum: motor, charger, spare filter, extension tube, floor nozzle and a crevice tool. No dust brush or hanger which I would have liked. Emptying the dust cup is neater than some. First the dust cup is removed from the motor and then the filter from the dust cup. There is a screen around the filter that keeps the dirt from sticking to it. I was somewhat amused by the styling of the name \"Keromee\"; from a distance it looks like \"Kenmore\". I don't think this is accidental.",

Done in 3 minutes. Cleaning the cup out was simple and easy and I charged her right after all was done for the next use. The charge which it came in with lasted approximately 20 minutes. I do not know if that was fully charged. I will see next time I use as now I know I charged her fully. Also did a few throw rugs with low pile great. If you are planning to do an entire big house with it I would not recommend. The area I did was approximately 500 sq. ft. She did a good job.",

I have vinyl flooring and with the little roller wheels it make my job super easy. Also with one malti poo it makes quick work of loose hair. It also can be used as a duster with attachment that came with. I don\u2019t know about carpet other than it could handle short tight knitted, but not high pile. It has two settings for suction and the low works fine but if you need more just push the button again. I am very happy with purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this vacuum for about five months now and came to write a review because I continue to be astounded by the value for the money.Over the past several years I have purchased several cordless stick vacuums, from no-brand to Bissel. They've all been decent but relative to cost, not all that impressive. I hate to create e-waste by purchasing more battery/cordless items, but hauling out the big vacuum for daily pet hair pickup is tedious.This little vacuum does exactly what I need it to: Stay charged long enough to pick up pet hair, tracked-in birdseed and garden debris, and general dust, quickly and easily. It has two power levels and in doing the 1,000 sq ft ground floor of my house, all hardwood or tile, it has not lost battery power yet. That's with a shedding Chihuahua.I've also used it as a handheld short-nozzled vacuum to pick up debris from doing crafts in the kitchen, to swoop crumbs out of silverware drawers, to vacuum the tracks of windows and other odd jobs. The entire unit is lightweight and the suction power is equal to or better than vacuums costing 2 or 3 times as much.It's no frills -- there is no beater brush in the vacuum head, and it only came with long & short extensions - but that is fine. There is no clunky battery - the power charging cord just plugs into the vacuum. It's easy to empty and the debris cup is easy to rinse out. A green flashing light tells you when it's charging.For less than $60 my expectations were low but it's been a very pleasant surprise.",
