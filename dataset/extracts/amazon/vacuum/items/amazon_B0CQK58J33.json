                "reviewText": "This is a great vac considering how low maintenance it is. While playing on the computer, I Crank This Baby up, put my headphones on, and do two things at once. As well, I do have long hair, so I shed a lot of hair on the floor. It does get caught in the rotor and thus I have to remove the hair from the rotor axis probably once or twice a week. But it is very easy to remove and let continue. It's as easy as cheese. Just pick up good ol' Harold, turn it around, pull off the rotor, and BAM! Pull out the hair, that isn't stuck to the actual rotor motor. QUICK AND SIMPLE. it is also NOT A BRUSH VAC. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT FOLKS, NOT A TRADITIONAL BRUSH VAC. Simple cleaning on hard wood floors, I don't know about carpet, but I don't have to open up the brush and clean it with a stick to remove hair from the brush, and then when I'm done, have to open the cylinder to remove the hair from the axle. NONE OF THAT. SIMPLE MAINTENANCE. Buy it.",

                "reviewText": "This is the third robot vacuum I have owned, all different brands. The first one was a gift from my children, and it felt life changing to have (after two decades of tiring housework it was amazing to have this major task taken off my plate). I decided to buy a second one a year later to try the mop feature (in hopes of taking another task off my very full plate). Both of those vacuums have been great, but this new one which I bought last month is definitely my favorite. The sleek blue design is nice, but most importantly the functions all work exceedingly well, and it does not have some of the downsides I experienced with the other two. The robot does not get stuck under cabinets, dressers, etc. - an unfortunate quirk that causes(d) my other ones to stall or spin out. It has such a smart design which among other benefits makes it super easy to clean in between uses. I especially like how the vacuum and mop functions are designed to function together on the unit (but can be used separately). It's nice to not have to switch out the parts in between vacuuming and mopping. I'm really happy with this new robot vacuum and the price was amazing.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great no frills robot vac. It has very good suction and the two brushes are great at getting the edges of your walls and around the bases of furniture. It is low enough to get under couches and counter edges. It picks up our dog hair without issue and isn't too loud. I can't give this 5 stars for a few reasons.First, it does not return to it's base when it is done with it's cleaning cycle. It just stops wherever it is done, which is odd because if you press the charge button it will return to the base. It is not a battery issue, because it always has around 30-40% charge left.Second, it will sometimes stop when it is close to an object, but sometimes it will actually hit the object before it stops. It doesn't do any damage to the object, but it does seem to be getting a lot of scratches on the front of the unit. Hopefully that will not affect the operation of it down the road.Lastly, the app is lacking some features that would make it easier to use the vacuum. The remote has more options than the app. It would be nice to be able to have more options and information on the app.Overall, this has been a good purchase, and it does everything that the more expensive ones do at a much better price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love this product! It helps me tremendously, by saving time, picking up all that pet hair (we have cats & dogs) and sweeps and mops at the same time for me! I love that I can sit back drink my coffee or read a book as it goes, also having the ability to use the app or the remote to help if it gets stuck or I want it to go over another area is wonderful. I would highly recommend this product as a must for anyone with little kids or pets! It used to take me a while to sweep and mop every single day, which I did because of my pets or the pet hair got out of control, and now like I said I can sit back take a break or do something else while this goes.Every now and then it can get stuck under a piece of furniture or pull a cord it never really wraps the cords up but it can pull them and it cuts itself off, so I do like that feature. I do not run it unless I'm home and can keep an eye on it. That's just my personal preference. I thought it was a really good deal I bought it when it was on a major sale and I actually bought this because my 14-year-old said mom you need this and sent me the link. Lol I almost didn't get it and I went ahead and got it for myself for a birthday gift. I am so glad I did!It's super easy to clean every time I use it I dump the dustbin out, I actually dumped the little dustbin out for each new area / room that I put it in. After dumping out the dustbin you wash out the dustbin and the filter you dump the water that's left over in the reservoir and you set them out of dry you pull the little pad off the bottom and you can wash it in the sink or throw it in the washer, you can order extras of these and once all that dries you can use it again the next day. I'm sure you could wait in between if you want to use it for a couple days before washing it but it does recommend with each use to do this and I find it's very quick and easy. You can also hit a button so it will return itself home. Where it will get on the base and begin to charge. The charge lasts very well I usually do a pretty good size living room dining room kitchen hallway and bathroom all at once and the battery never dies. If you're on the fence about it just go ahead and get it!",
