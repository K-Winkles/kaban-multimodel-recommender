                "reviewText": "Having used Bissell Big Green products exclusively for over a year for my cleaning business, I was eager to try this commercial stick vacuum. Once I received it I immediately fully charged it. The next day I tried it bright and early. I'd say its weight was nice to pick it up it's very light. First on the kitchen and bathroom floors. It did well, picking up hair, crumbs, etc. The lights make it easier to see what you're about to pick up. On my rugs it did well, picking up lint and pet fur. It even tackled my carpeted bedrooms, but there it took two or more passes to pick up any lint or debris. Luckily I have a small home, because the battery that was advertised as lasting 45 minutes using low power only lasted 15-20 minutes using low power. If you put it on high power you could see the light indicators going out within five minutes. Testing this stick vacuum was really important because I clean for a living. Needless to say, I'd need at least five fully charged batteries to get this vacuum through a regular day. Using it only in rooms/areas where a larger vacuum was unnecessary or too large. I was expecting it to live up to the manufacturer's description, at least. Also, when fully extended it was still too short for me to stand up straight. I'm 5'10\". Even though I was getting bummed I took it out in the field. It needed to be charged most of the day, so I had to go back to my heavy conventional vacuum. I suggested that my wife use it on some of her places. She liked it, but battery life was the biggest complaint, along with not being able to effectively pick up our a lot of pet fur from a hardwood floor, requiring multiple passes, and eventually switching back to the conventional vacuum. I really wanted to like this vacuum. Bissell makes some excellent products, but not this one. It should not be labeled as a Big Green Commercial anything. It reminds me more of a toy vacuum by Fisher Price or something.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this vacuum for bare floors and big rugs. Have no pets so that was not an issue. I charged this vacuum as required and followed all instructions. It is quieter than most but does not have the suction power that I need. Have to go over same spot several times to get it all. Also, one other feature that I'm not happy with is that it will not lock to stand alone. I have to prop it against something if I need to stop and move say a chair to get under it. Don't like that!! I will be returning after only using several times. Tried to like it, but will be going back. Also, after fully charged, it loses power almost immediately. The description says it will last a good 45 minutes but after only using about 3-4 minutes, one bar disappeared so I know the charge would not last the full 45 minutes. I do like the concept of a swivel unit at the bottom to allow for extra movement, the light weight, the green and gray colors, and the hand-held option.",
