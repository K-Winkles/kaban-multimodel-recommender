First time I used it the dirty water bin was like chocolate milk and it has only been about 12 days since I mopped with the Bona pad. I was vacuuming and then mopping separately. I was using the pad that I would have to run under water several times. So this new vacuum/mop saves time and gets my floors cleaner. I love it! Only complaint is that it does not get right up to the floor board/trim. There is about an inch or less space that I can see did not get wet right close to the floor board/trim.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn\u2019t decide between the corded Hyrovac and the corded Bissell Crosswave until I saw a head-to-head comparison video of the two on Vacuum Wars. The key points that swayed my decision to the Hydrovac were the much easier filter cleaning, the easier self-cleaning, the better/smoother swivel action, and the fact that, despite less raw power, the effective cleaning ability was a draw between the two. Add to that the much lower price for the Hydrovac and the decision was easy.So far I\u2019ve been very pleased with this. It\u2019s easy to use, does a very nice job on tile floors, and is easy to maintain. The cons for me are mostly along the lines of build quality issues. For example, the filter holder is not all that sturdy, so you need to take care when opening it to not break the plastic tabs. But, I have two other Shark vacs, and while they both have some less than ideal build quality issues, neither has failed on me yet. So I\u2019m hoping for an equally long life from this Hydrovac.You can use other cleaners in this provided they are low/no suds. The Shark cleaner works well, but it\u2019s quite pricey. There are other equally good cleaners from Hoover, Bissell and commercial cleaners (such as Ludmark) that cost less per use and work just fine in the Hydrovac. You don\u2019t want to use an acidic cleaner (such as vinegar) or any cleaner that has suds since those will damage the water pump in the Hydrovac.It\u2019s well worth picking up a spare set of filters and rollers. While the roller gets pretty well cleaned in the self-clean cycle, it\u2019s still worth giving it a good hand wash. Plus, it\u2019s not recommended to store the machine with a wet roller or wet filter to prevent mold/mildew. If you have spares you can swap out the wet ones for dry ones, and let the wet ones air dry.The Hydrovac has cut down on my cleaning time without any decrease in how clean the floors get. That\u2019s worth five stars in my book!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Didn't work straight out of the box - UPDATED",
                "reviewText": "UPDATED 2/7/23:So after my first purchase which didn't work out of the box, I bit the bullet and bought another, because I'd watched all the videos and remained convinced that this was the wet/dry mop I wanted. Not to mention, the Shark rep I'd contacted said this was the first time she'd seen this particular problem. I figured if Try #2 didn't work, I'd go to a different mop.I'm happy to say that as soon as I assembled the device and turned it on - it worked! So I went ahead and fully charged it.I've now used it over the entire house (except the carpeted areas). Here's my thoughts:1. Fully charged, the mop lasts maybe 25 minutes. This is enough for me to mop two large rooms and an area rug or two. If you have a big house (as I do), prepare to take several days to clean the whole thing. For me that's not a deal-breaker, I don't like to spend my whole day cleaning, so doing it in smaller chunks is really good. It took me four goes to get the entire house and all the area rugs.2. The clean water tank emptied or nearly emptied with every run. Maybe half the water ended up in the dirty water tank - and it was OPAQUE. So either my floors were horrifically dirty, or... okay, we'll just go with horrifically dirty floors. I haven't gone over any for a second pass so I'm not sure how much was left, but given how dark that water was, wouldn't shock me. I do feel as though the mop did a great clean, though - and the solution that came with it made the whole room smell very fresh.3. It's LOUD. I waited for my husband to walk the dog to run the mop. My dog heard the mop from the street and came racing back to save me. I set up the cleaning station in the basement behind two closed doors. I can hear the cleaning cycle through the closed doors from another floor in my house. LOUD.4. The cleaning solution dries very quickly. I was able to walk across a dried floor within a few minutes of having mopped it.5. I didn't have much trouble picking up small debris - tiny plastic wrapper corners, random hairs, small *small* bits of paper. Anything larger or more noticeable than a quarter, you'll want to pick up by yourself.6. I DID have trouble getting up dried stains. That Kool-Aid my kid spilled in the corner three days ago and didn't bother to tell me about or wipe up themselves? Nope. The mop got a lot of it, but not all. (Note to self: talk to kid.) Fresher stains (like the Kool-Aid I noticed from this morning but gleefully planned to pick up with the new mop) picked up just fine.TL:DR - Good mop, well worth the money, totally glad I tried again. I can see myself happily pulling this out for mopping every couple of weeks without too much fuss or heartache.That said, if you buy it... make sure it works the MINUTE you unbox it, but rest assured that if it doesn't, you can return it without too much trouble.ORIGINAL:I was so excited to receive this item; I unboxed it, plugged it in immediately to charge overnight (which the manual says is fine to do)... just to discover that it didn't work. Oh, the power turned on just fine, but the brush roller never spun, so I got an error message within ten seconds of trying to clean my floors. I couldn't even make the roller spin with my bare hands, it was STUCK, and for no discernable reason why, exactly as if some technician had tightened a screw too much. After a quick call to Shark's customer service - which I reached without trouble or wait - I was told my only option was to return it. The rep confirmed that the roller should have turned easily with my hands. (I have two other Shark vacuums, and both have rollers that turn with ease.)So, two stars because Shark's service reps were quick and helpful (they even set up a video link on my cell so they could see the vacuum in action!). I'll confirm that the vacuum was very light and would have been a breeze to use, if it'd worked.But docked three stars because it didn't work, and it should have, being brand-spanking-still-with0-the-stickers new. Considering that the manual also said that they test each vacuum before shipping... well, I kinda have to wonder if they really do that, because this seems like the thing they should have caught.I really wanted this device, but now I'm super nervous about ordering a replacement. I guess my floors will stay dirty a little while longer.",
