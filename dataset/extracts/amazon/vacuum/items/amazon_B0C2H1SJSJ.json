On the negative - butt ugly choice of colors (industrial white and blue) and the handle feels cheap because after all it is a budget vacuum cleaner but it is an AWESOME MACHINE! I started out on the low setting on my carpet and could barely move it back and forth. I went up two settings and it was much better and still cleaned like I have never seen before. It was super easy to assemble, great manual, very easy to clean, and I LOVE the fact it has a floor/tool selector control knob so you do not have to move the vacuum hose around, just turn the knob when you want to switch to tools and go!!!!",

                "reviewText": "The reviews that stated this vacuum will suck itself to the floor are true. It has monster suction. On its highest setting it will still suck itself down on my carpet at times. It will also pull more dirt from your carpets than youve ever seen, yes the decals will peel off after a few months too. I think this would be a good vacuum for an older person as it is extremely light weight except for the sucking itself down to the floor may be an issue as it takes some effort to get it loose or just shut it off and restart. Very easy to remove and dump the canister. You do have a little assembly to do before using, 4 or 5 phillips screws to install the upper handle assy. When using the hose and attachments you have to turn a knob to the hose position then turn it back when you want floor suction. Before you start to vacuum you will need to pick up anything you dont want wrapped up in the brush roller as this thing is a Monster. You cant drive over the vacuum wire with this vacuum as it will be damaged in seconds its a Monster. Cant leave leave it sitting on your carpet long while using the hose and attachments because the brush doesnt stop turning when you bring it up into a locked position you will have no carpet in that location. I lay the vacuum on its back when I use the hose or just pick it up with one hand vacuum with the other. Its a very plain looking vacuum and may appear cheap but so far has held up well its a Monster. This is a very manual vacuum that has Tremendous suction it does leave rows in your carpet if you have the carpet height setting real low. You DO NOT want to run over any extension cords or anything with this vacuum its a Monster. Overall I really like this vacuum, I would purchase again in a second but its a Monster becareful with it it could suck your cat or small dog up into it in a split second because its a Monster. Good Luck!UPDATE: OK after having this vacuum for awhile I still like it but it still sucks itself down to the carpet and makes it very hard to push and pull. I have found something that makes this not so bad. The knob in which you turn to transfer suction from the hose to the floor and vice versa dont turn it all the way to the floor suction setting let it suck through the hose a little and it still has plenty of suction to pick up most anything on your floor but not suck itself down. You can fine tune where the knob needs to be just before it starts to suck itself down and make a mark with a sharpie on the white housing where the pointer is pointing that way you know where to set it each time. Hope this is helpful for some.",

                "reviewText": "I like that it's powerful except that it will sort of jump between the height setting levels on its own. I'll set it for vacuuming a low pile carpet, but when it goes over the edge of the carpet onto the floor, on the return, it digs into the carpet like it's got rubber bumpers. I end up having to grab the vacuum with both hands and push it with all my might just to get it to move on the carpet that it just was vacuuming perfectly fine before it went off the edge onto the floor and back. It's annoying as hell to be honest. And then, if I'm lucky, it'll go back to normal vacuuming. It's like a car that the automatic transition transmission jumps in and out of gears.I have two shag carpets and on one it works smooth as butter and on the other it jumps in and out of gears from being manageable to requiring the hulk to move it. It's a little heavier than my usual vacuums, but then I'm used to buying ultra cheap Walmart ones and this one is better quality. I don't know how long or how often that brush level self adjustment glitch is going to last. It's been about 6 months and it's still doing it. I'm too lazy to go through trying to return it, even though it's probably too late. Yes, I do know to manually select the carpet levels on the front of the vacuum. I'm pretty mechanical and I've tried to determine how the mechanism might be malfunctioning, but I can't without taking it completely apart. Not worth it to me. At least when I vacuum now, I don't need to go to the gym.",

                "reviewText": "I am a clean freak and vacuum almost every single day, (sometimes multiple times per day) so I def know a thing or two about vacuums. Over the last 30+ years I have spent hundreds of dollars on some of the top name vacuums and the brands that are supposedly the \"best\" ones on the market, \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4eand I have never been more impressed with a vacuum like I am with this bad boy here. \ud83d\ude0dThis bad mother f-er will suck up your fridge, stove and even your children if you're not careful - it is THAT freaking powerful.\ud83d\ude33 The good thing about it sucking the dirt from underneath the carpet pad and floorboards ( I mean that's enough by itself right there am I right? ) is that if u happen to suck up something on accident that was in the next room over or downstairs \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23, u can easily open the container and get it back out. Shipping was super fast and it was soooo easy to put together-it literally took 3 min- which is a huge bonus and it's not super heavy or bulky. I can't believe how awesome this vacuum is - especially for the price and wish I had found it years ago! Do yourself a favor and GET this vacuum. It is fan-freaking-tastic and u will not regret it, I promise u. \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43",
