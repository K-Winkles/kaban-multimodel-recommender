                "reviewText": "Title says it all. this thing really suck it up. My wife had just vacuumed our rugs with our other vac. She was surprised when this came in. She need a lighter model, plus one with the hose feature and attachments. Plus, she likes the lift-off. Anyhow, she decided to try it on the rugs. Let me tell you, that other vac sucks that it didn't suck. You would not believe the dirt and dust it left behind. It got my of the dirt you can see, but there was definitely more in the fibers and deep down. So much in fact, the rugs changed colors. Well, not really, but yes, the cleaning was so good, the rugs looks new. The colors were richer and brighter, not dulled by dust and dirt.I found my son cleaning high up shelves and such today. He had lifted the tank off and set it on the counter while using the hose to clean high up shelves, for spring cleaning. This think makes work easier, if you have older vacs, it does a way better job. If you do not use the thumb switch to lessen the suction, you run into the trouble of it sucking up lighter weight rugs. I am telling, this thing is stout!It is decently light weight, it swivels and steers wonderfully, and the LED light really helps you see the dirt. I love it on hardwood floors. You takes thing thing across it, thinking your floor is pretty clean. Weeeellll, you might not see anything because you do not see any big pieces of debris, but the light shows you every spec of dust and hair, to your horror and dismay. No, problem. this thing glides right over it and sucks it up and the light ensures you can see where you have been and need to be without having to repeat yourself. You can turn the spinner brush on or off, so you don't have to worry about it throwing big pieces across the room.I wanted it all, for my us, especially my wife, who uses it the most, so I got what I think she needed, the most, some how and maybe I missed it, but the one thing I wish this had was a retractable power cord. She has wanted one. But, I did not see a model that had all this AND the retractable cord. Not anywhere near this price anyhow. If this is within your budget. I would say treat yourself and be happier and more dust/dirt/allergen free.",

                "reviewText": "Important notes: I have not had this vacuum for long at all and have only used it a handful of times, so I cannot speak to its lasting power or it\u2019s quality over time. I do not have any stairs, so I cannot attest to its stair cleaning ability. I am also a vacuum newbie, and don\u2019t have a ton of vacuum experience to compare this to. However, I do have a deep love for vacuuming and will try as be as unbiased and honest as possibleMy review is five stars, when taking into account the price and promises of this vacuum. I\u2019m sure there are vacuums that work a thousand times better than this, but for the price you are getting a quality vacuum. I wouldn\u2019t say this vacuum is worth $500, but it is worth the <$200 I payed for it.Pros:- vacuum is easy to assemble and easy to take apart, with clearly labeled latches for all the features that can be detached and turned on/off- i find the whole thing very customizable and modular, but still easy to understand- the attachments are well designed, with the brush attaching to the tube attachment, and they store nicely on the main body- i wasn\u2019t totally sold on the lift off feature, but i think it\u2019s totally awesome after using it. i can get all sorts of new places- the lights on the front are incredibly bright and more useful than i thought they would be- the cleaning is super easy, and i appreciate that the filters can be reused and don\u2019t create unnecessary waste/have to be ordered- it totally gets pet hair out of the carpet as promised- the tube is super flexible, and i love that you can use both the handle/wand as well as the tube on its ownThings that are not pros or cons:- the vacuum steers pretty well, but can be a little unpredictable to control. there is definitely a learning curve- you have to reach inside the dirt chamber to clean part of the dirt chamber setup, which is probably standard, but is a little gross- vacuum is not super loud, but definitely noisy. pretty standard- attaching the lift off feature back to the base has a bit of a learning curve, more so than the other attachments- there is no lever to take the vacuum out of the upright position. i find this a bit stressful, as i feel like i\u2019m going to break something.- I wouldn\u2019t say the vacuum itself is absurdly heavy or unwieldy when used as a standard vacuum. it\u2019s not as light as a stick vacuum, but i\u2019ve certainly used heavierCons:- the lift off feature is quite heavy. not great for people who are older or have mobility issues. i cannot imagine holding it while vacuuming blinds as is shown in the ads, and find myself usually setting it on a table/the ground- the reach of the lift off tube could definitely be longer- unlike other bissel vacuums, the cord does not wind back into the main body of the vacuum. i find it to be quite unwieldy, as it is very long. the extra reach is nice, but the cord is constantly in the way- i also find that the cord is hard to wrap, as it\u2019s very thick and heavy- while the tank appears large, i find that it fills up quite quickly to the \u201cfull\u201d line and needs to be emptied pretty often- the vacuum struggles to remove human hair from the carpet, and you will have to \u201cscrub\u201d the carpet with the brush attachment to get it out- the little brush attachment gets dirty really quickly, and you have to pull hair and lint off of it. also probably pretty standard, but it\u2019s pretty icky.- the pet hair attachment can be a little difficult to use, especially when attached to the wand. and i don\u2019t find myself using it over the normal brush attachmentSo that\u2019s my review! Would I recommend this product? Absolutely, if you\u2019re looking at mid range vacuums. It does what is promised, and as long as the cons don\u2019t outweigh the pros, I would say go for it! I had a blast using this vacuum and will continue to have a blast using it until I can justify spending $500+ on a vacuum.",

We have 2 German Shepherds and when they shed, they SHED and this vacuum makes very short work of all the fur that\u2019s left behind.The reason I do NOT recommend it: The unfortunate part and the reason I\u2019m returning it is after only a week and a half of using it I\u2019ve had to untangle it twice, the first time was with the pet tool and the second was with the main beater bar assembly which was so bad that it stopped, began smelling and when I disassembled it to remove the tangle I found that part of the beater bar assembly had melted.The vacuum itself is great, does a great job but there is a design flaw and hopefully Bissell can get this rectified because it definitely has potential of being fantastic!",

I'm a long time loyal fan and customer of BissellThis new vacuum that I recently purchased with Amazon is amazing. First a huge thank you to Amazon for making the purchase affordable for customers with their payment planThis vacuum has above all superior suction power. It is not as noisy as my previous vacuums. It maneuvers quite well. Numerous options for the maneuvering.It's pretty much a lightweight vacuum.What I want to point out is that there's LED Lights built in the vacuum at the frontI have a degenerative eye condition and I have to say this feature is very important for me and I am very happy with Bissell for having this featureI am totally satisfied with my purchase",
