                "reviewText": "This is a strong little sucker! I was impressed with the suction power and it seems well made and sturdy with thick plastic casing. The only negative I found was that it won\u2019t work at all unless the battery is fully charged. My makita battery was blinking with the red and green lights so I thought there may enough juice but it would only turn on for a second when the button was pushed. I let it charge a bit longer and then all was good. It\u2019s really handy being able to snap that battery on and it\u2019s definitely stronger than any other battery charged mini vac I\u2019ve used.",
