After reading all the info, I ordered it as a gift knowing that if she didn't like it, Amazon returns are \"no hassle\" and easy. Turns out, she loves it. First of all, it is relatively light weight, assembles easily, maneuvers under furniture and tables and charges quickly. When it's time to empty the unit of accumulated debris, it can be a little tricky if your grip is compromised. You have to hold onto it with two hands. I found it easier to remove the pole that attaches the vacuum head to the unit before emptying. I just may order one for myself and move on from plugging in cords! Love the color too!",

Picks up droppings and hay. The hay doesn't clog the tube! I do empty the little canister often so it works at its best. The filter is metal!!! Tap it when you take it out and it's like new. It only takes seconds to empty. SO light. Easy to maneuver. Gets in all the crazy corners. It's so small I charge it in my bedroom and set it in the corner by my couch. You don't even notice it. If you have bunnies, or birds or cat litter boxes that constant tidying up can be so annoying. This is a game changer!!!",

So glad I picked this model as it does exactly that. This is not a model you would want to use on carpets though, as it wouldn't remove things like fur embedded on that type of surface.If you plan on using it everyday, charge it every few days as it's a small machine and will run out of juice quickly. Also I clean out the canister after each use.Overall it suits my needs perfectly.",
