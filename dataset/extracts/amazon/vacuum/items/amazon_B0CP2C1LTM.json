                "reviewText": "This Fabuletta vacuum cleaner has good suction but the head does not clean as thoroughly as I expected. There are three power settings, but even on the highest setting the bristles do not make enough contact with the floor surface to knock the dust and dirt loose so that it may be vacuumed up. The battery life is much improved from the last Fabuleta I owned and this one can last for about 15-16 minutes on the highest setting and get some serious cleaning done. One of the coolest features is that the vacuum at any time can be stored standing up without any stand.This is a great vacuum, just wish it had more battery life and that it charged faster. It takes about 3.5 hours to charge it when it is completely drained. If you have a small area of hardwood floors with some rugs and carpeting, this vacuum works well in those conditions. The led lights on the front help illuminate the dirt and dust and shows you what is clean and what is not. A well made and sturdy vacuum with a filter that is easy to clean and reuse. The battery makes tha vacuum a bit heavy after a few minutes, but it is manageable. I do not like the speed adjust button, as it is located in a strange location on the battery itself. I think this may be why the battery is heavy but not necessarily long lived. The fact that this stores easily and is free standing make it ideal for small living spaces.",

                "reviewText": "The cordless vacuum is constructed mostly of hard plastic and finished aluminum. It is fairly light and easy to handle. The height is readably adjustable with \"stop\" points at about 1\" intervals -- it is easy to set the vacuum at a comfortable distance.. It has 3 speed levels that are controlled by an easily accessible button. On the lowest speed setting, the vacuum is fairly quiet. Controlling the vacuum direction and angle is simple and effortless. The brush head swivels 180 degrees. Vacuum assembly is fast and the pieces fit together firmly and securely. Assembling the unit is quite intuitive, however the instructions are not overly detailed and the print is exceedingly small. The vacuum can be set on the floor and is \"free standing\" -- but just barely, as it will easily tip over.The vacuum cleaner has USB charging that I estimate to be between 4-6 hours from a zero charge point. There are 3 readily viewed blue LED lights that tell you the level of charge left and when charging is needed. It comes with a detachable brush and extra length tube accessories. The Hepa filter is washable and feels like it is strong paper, coated with a material to help resist repeated wet cleaning. It also comes with an extra Hepa filter. It has a plastic bracket unit for hanging the vacuum on a wall (for some reason the two screws for attaching it were not included or were lost during shipment). Emptying and cleaning the waste/debris holder requires little effort.The machine is built for sturdiness, durability, ease of use and effectiveness. The vacuum cleaner is very reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "My wife wanted to buy a stick vacuum from the expensive brand and I could not justify the cost. I ordered this one and was skeptical that this would be a quality product given the price. I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I opened the box. All the pieces felt well built and fit together very well.We have hard surface floors with a few small throw rugs. I used it several times and it cleans very well. It held a charge for at least 30 mins. The suction is strong enough for our hard floors. The headlights are a nice touch and it is lightweight enough for me.It is very flexible as you can easily change from a floor vacuum with a motorized power head to a short handheld one to clean inside furniture crevices. Emptying the canister is easy too.One downside I have is that it does take 4-5 hours to charge but the manufacturer does tell you that in their advertising.I recommend this vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "We have needed a new vacuum cleaner for quite a while, and seeing the much lower price of this one compared to actually replacing or upgrading from our other model (and on which we have already replaced batteries, filters, and more...but it just ain't what it used to be) seemed a risk worthy of taking.If it does as good of a job but just doesn't last forever, we're really not out much in comparison.And whoa...it works quite well! And it even has some features that the other \"fancier, pricier\" one did not, such as a light in front of the area aimed for, which allows you to see allllllllllll of that dog hair that much more clearly before sucking it all.Unfortunately, this one doesn't so strongly suck, though. It feels like a more stable vacuum head, and there's a little button on the vacuum head to push to get it all in gear, but then when it is fully going, it doesn't feel like a whole lot is happening. And yet...it is! For the light shows the absence, then, of all those dog hairs and masses once vacuumed.Upon the first full charge, the battery did last right around 15 minutes, which was what was advertised (15-45 minutes per charge...and with 4-6 hours' charging necessary). That's not long enough, unfortunately for our daily or every other day dog hair removal from four rooms worth of vinyl plank flooring. And this vacuum does not super well touch the area rugs throughout, but that may be the (other) user's feeling more than my own.Certain satisfaction came, for sure, from asking HIM to give it all a shot so that he could help me write this review.He's of the mind that the new vacuum is not fantastic...but I'm certain that watching him use the new vacuum is!So, we don't 100% agree.But I maintain, as I asserted earlier, that for the money, this is a great battery-charged and -operating stick vacuum with all the right and necessary attachments and providing a pretty decent cleaning.",
