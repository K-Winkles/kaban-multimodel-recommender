It's also excellent for cleaning stairs, because it's able to reach all the way into the corners of each step. It's lightweight, and has several different attachments. The one thing I don't care for is the air. This vacuum blows air out as it cleans just like any other vacuum. Except this one blows it right in my face. I tried moving it, and holding it a different way, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I have really bad allergies. So having air with any little amount of dust blowing right at me is never a good thing. I don't think it would be okay even if I didn't have allergies. It's easy to use, and I didn't really have to assemble it, which was nice. The directions are terrible. They explain how to clean it. That part is okay, but they don't explain what works best for different surfaces, or how to operate it. This isn't my first vacuum so I was able to figure out how to use it without too much difficulty. But a little guidance with a machine I had never used before would have been appreciated.",

I've used better, but I've used a lot worse.The build quality is pretty cheap, after a while of interchanging parts, they don't stay together as well anymore. You may need to tape them.The suction power works well on hardwood floors but sucks on carpets (pun intended).That being said, it does come with attachments that make it easier to clean hard-to-reach places.The weight is average, so it's not light but it's easy to use for long periods.It's easy to clean out when it's full.Overall, a cheap basic vacuum that does an okay job on hardwood but terrible on carpet.",

The suction for this vacuum performs well on this device if the attachment had a little bit of revision. It does great when you attach the small brush fitting to clean out crumbs from the couch, but lacks once you place the long hose. You can feel the heat from the plastic housing if you use it for an extended period of time. Overall, I'm pleased at the product performance in small spaces.",

                "reviewText": "I was eager to get this vacuum for cleaning up crumbs in the kitchen and cleaning the car. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed after testing it. It has reasonably good suction, comparable to other hand-held vacuums, and it comes with two extra filters. Those are the only good things I can say about it. It does not have two speeds, as the instructions say. It seems as if the designers combined the worst aspects of a conventional vacuum with the worst aspects of a hand-held. The attachments are very flimsy and keep coming loose. The floor attachment does not work on carpets, and the brush and crevice attachments cannot be used with the extension pipes. The power head is heavy and poorly balanced, so tiring to hold. And it has a cord, which is an absolute nuisance, especially for cleaning the car.",

It can pick up smaller pieces best, but it can clog up quickly. I had a difficult time keeping the pieces of the pipe together. I ended up putting some tape around it. It did much better after that. The dust bin opens and empties easy. I don\u2019t feel like it is a great vacuum for carpet. But, it does pick up dirt and small pieces on hard surfaces. I have been using it as a designated cat litter clean up vacuum. It works pretty well for that purpose and my other vacuum doesn\u2019t end up having a litter odor.",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this vacuum. It plugs into the wall, which afford it a lot of extra power in suction. However, it is very cheaply made, and the plastic is precariously thin. The wand is not very sturdy, and I am sure it will crack at some point soon. It doesn\u2019t click into place, you have to force it on there. Attachments like that tend to eventually stop holding and just fall off, without a mechanism that clicks it in. The floor attachment doesn\u2019t have a beater bar, so it\u2019s not really good for any carpets. It works fine on hard floors again the suction power is the best thing about this vacuum. I don\u2019t see this lasting very long, but I am enjoying using it while I have it. I just use it in my home office to do a quick tidy. I\u2019m not using it across my whole home, but I do think it takes the place of a little mini vacuum for quick messes. I just wish it were better quality and the pieces didn\u2019t seem so flimsy.",
