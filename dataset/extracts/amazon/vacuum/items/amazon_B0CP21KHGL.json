                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this stick vac. I bought it during prime days to replace an old stick vac I had bought 3 years ago that broke. This one is far superior to my old one. Features that I love are: it actually sucks debris and hair off all of the surfaces in my home, it stands up on its own, the accessories attach right to it so they aren\u2019t laying in a closet somewhere, the battery pops off and can be charged independently, it\u2019s easy to use, lightweight, it has led lights on the floor brush roll, I can go on and on. It only took about an hour to fully charge the first time. The battery is down 1 bar since a full charge after one day. But I can\u2019t stop vacuuming everything in my house. It even picked up grass that was stuck on to my entry mats. My big vacuum can barely do that. This is prob not a vacuum to do a whole house full of carpet or heavy duty deep cleaning for hours but if you want something for in between guests, crumbs from your kids, those hairball tumbleweeds from pets or whatever other annoying messes that happen\u2026this vac is amazing. I would 100% buy this again and recommend it to others. Can\u2019t go wrong with this one, buy it!",
