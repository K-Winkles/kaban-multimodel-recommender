                "reviewText": "Pros: This vacuum has the suction/power to clean very well on all surfaces: tile, wood, furniture and carpet. It is very lightweight. Good attachments. Super easy to clean. You can even take the canister completely off and apart so it can be washed, just dry thoroughly before using again.Cons: It's loud. Because it's so lightweight, it can be difficult to maneuver when using the attachments. The hose doesn't go back to original shape/size, material issue. Short power cord, only good for one room.Even given these cons, I love this vacuum and am very happy with it, especially the price! I'm so happy with it that I bought a second one to have one upstairs and one on main floor.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, it's a nice little unit.Very lightweight. Simple to use.The small brush head is perfect for small areas under coffee tables and between the legs of end tables and square back kitchen chairs.Overall vacuuming performance is good. It sucks the deap dust and dirt out of the carpet. It picks up my 2 foot long golden locks well. It does a great job on the kitchen floor as well.The cons are these...Hair gets caught in the little basket at the top of the dust bin. It builds up and blocks the dust bunnies from hitting the can. If I vacuum 2ce a week it won't clog on me before I finish my 1 bed apt. It's a minor inconvenience and is expected due to the length of my hair and the facts I am losing it everywhere I go the last few years. Any vacuum would eventually succumb.Also, the edge cleaner action on the vacuum head is not the best. In Spite of the fact it has great floor suction. You'll find yourself undoing the hose and going over baseboards with the brush or the little narrow tool or simply w/o an attachment. All 3 serve a great purpose and do their jobs well. Just don't expect to get all the edge dirt on the passes. It'll leave the most stubbornly far away in the edges specs of debris.I am a disabled vet with L4 and L5 ruptured and repaired. It's light enough I can use it w/o straining my back at all and it fits in all the little spots other vacuums will not. Less furniture scooting and lifting.If you want to reach the top valance on the mini blinds you can't. The hose is too short. I pick up the entire vacuum no problem to reach high. Put it on a square back chair. I have a 3 stepper I put it on the top as I stand on the middle stair. About 80 bucks for a great 3 stepper ladder.Overall it's a great little unit that outperforms it's size. I would not recommend this for any more than a 600 square foot space. Because of the small brush head it'd take a long time to vacuum a 2 bedroom on up. It would make a fantastic upstairs exclusively vacuum. The hose is wayyy too short for it to be used as a car vac.My recommendation is buy it w/o fear if my description fits your needs.",

                "reviewText": "For the low price, I had my doubts. But I just recently moved into a formally hoarded house that is still holding onto a millions years of dust, dirt, and cobwebs everywhere. This vacuum has been doing great! it doesn't feel like the suction is strong, but canister after full canister of filth proves otherwise. It does great on thick carpeting, as well as hardwood/tile/linoleum.The only thing annoying is the short(ish) cord, but the lightweight nature of the entire unit, as well as the ease of use more than makes up for it. In truth, if I want to keep going without having to re-plug it into a closer outlet, I could just attached a dedicated extension cord to make it easier for me. The canister is not huge, and mine fills quickly due to the level of dirt in this house. It works better if you empty it at the two-thirds fill point.Other than those two minor things, I would highly recommend this model if you need something affordable and durable.",

                "reviewText": "So it does suck up dust and what not well enough to get a couple stars. But the fact that it\u2019s SO lightweight (due to it being made out of cheap plastic) is an issue even though it\u2019s a nice quality to have for transportation. I have to push all of my weight into the vacuum as I\u2019m using it because it\u2019s so light and the suction won\u2019t suffice without a little more weight pushing it into the carpet. And the cord, goodness gracious I can\u2019t even vacuum my whole living room from one outlet. Mind you I live in a 900sqft home so it\u2019s not a large room. Lastly if you\u2019re a person of tall stature and it pains you to be bent forward I\u2019d recommend looking into other vacuums. It\u2019s an average height id say but there\u2019s no adjustment option to add height and for some like myself that may be troublesome for their back pain. Besides those issues it\u2019s a usable, efficient enough vacuum. The price wasn\u2019t too horrible and I\u2019ll likely be able to get enough life out of it before I buy a better more expensive vacuum.",
