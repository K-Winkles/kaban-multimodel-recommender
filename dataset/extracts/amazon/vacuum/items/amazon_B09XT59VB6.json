                "reviewText": "We bought this stick vacuum so we could easily and quickly vacuum our new shag rug (9x13 with 1.75\u201d pile height).We\u2019re a family of five with two medium sized dogs: pit/boxer and pit/lab. The pit/lab sheds like it\u2019s her job. :( We have a robot vacuum that runs on the hardwood floors twice a day, but it\u2019s can\u2019t handle the shag rug. This stick vacuum does the trick! So much so that it\u2019s embarrassing!!We vacuum it at least once a week, sometimes twice, and the pictures show how much this little sucker pulls out of the rug Every. Single. Time! I vacuum it both directions to make sure no traffic patterns develop, and it\u2019s keeps the rug looking soft and fluffy.It\u2019s definitely worth the purchase. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!Pros:* Light weight* Corded (no dying batteries)* Suction power* Handles the high pile rug like a champ* Easy to empty (I empty after every vacuum)* Attachments (for the couch and nooks&crannies)Cons:* Doesn\u2019t come with a hanger or hook (you\u2019re actually supposed to take the top part off and hang it on itself, so you lower the center of gravity. I think this is dumb, but it might work for some.)* No storage area for the attachments (this is typical of all stick vacuums though.)* Kind of pricey (but worth it!)",

I wanted a cordless one but I'm pleased with the vaccum. The only thing I don't like is that it fills up really quick & you have to empty it several times BUT it gets up all the trapped hair & debris in the carpet. This one actually works better than the one I purchased brand new. Easy to use light to use, gets under & around things easily. Worth the money & there was a warranty if you wanted it.",

                "reviewText": "First, let me just say that I love this vacuum cleaner. I also have a Riccar, and while that vacuum is amazing and powerful, it's also prohibitively heavy for everyday cleaning. I have pets, and need to vacuum more often, so I grabbed this Shark for that purpose. It's fantastic. It's light and easy to maneuver, the suction is strong without sucking up my area rugs, and it's super easy to clean. The only downside is that it is NOT made to stand up on its own. This means that if you're cleaning and need to move something real quick you can't just leave the vac standing there- you have to lean it against something, or balance it, or disconnect it so that the top can rest on the hook.I know the description says this, but I didn't really process how annoying it would be until I started using it. It is really not a dealbreaker for me, but it might be for you.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't planning to write a review for a freaking vacuum but holy crap! The suction on this thing is so strong that it actually causes some friction to build up while you're using it (I have a bit of difficulty pushing it in straight lines because of that and the easy steering of the base).I tested it out on a 4 foot x 4 foot section of our living room rug and as you can see from the photo, it filled the canister to about 3/4 full.... And this is insane because I had just vacuumed that rug two days ago. I knew our old vacuum was crap but I had no idea how much dirt and cat hair it was leaving behind.The only negative I'd say about this--other than that it's hard to store it because it's top heavy and will fall over when you lean it against anything--is that the canister is rather small, so I pretty much have to empty it after every room (most of which are about 300 sq feet). I don't even care though because now we have something that can stand up to the nasty cat fuzz that embeds itself into every surface!!",

                "reviewText": "This shark rocket is an incredible machine. I just put down new floors that are luxury vinyl plank. The manufacturer states not to use a vacuum with a beater brush. I have a dog and a cat, so lots of pet hair. This little stick vacuum does an incredible job of picking up everything. It has extremely strong suction. I am handicapped and have bad shoulders, but I can handle this easily. I love the fact that I don\u2019t have to worry about the battery losing power since this is a plug-in. It stores nicely. I wish I had bought it years ago. BTW, this is my fourth shark product and I have always been happy with them.",
