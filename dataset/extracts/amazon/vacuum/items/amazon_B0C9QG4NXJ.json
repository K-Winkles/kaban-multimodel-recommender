The vacuum's ability to switch between standard and turbo suction modes is a game-changer, so effectively taking away all the trash in my room from hair to dust. The lightweight design, at only 2.6 pounds, makes it incredibly easy to handle, reducing the strain of cleaning. It's absolutely a great alternative to the expensive Dyson vacuum cleaners.The detachable and rechargeable 2200mAh battery provides ample run time, lasting up to 35 minutes in standard mode. This wireless convenience allows me to clean without the hassle of cords. The 180\u00b0 rotatable LED brush head is another standout feature I really enjoyed, illuminating dark corners and ensuring no dirt is missed. The multiple attachments, including flat suction nozzles and a brush expansion, make it versatile for cleaning floors, ceilings, and hard-to-reach areas.The 4-stage filtration system impressively captures all the dust particles, and the dustbin is spacious enough for extended cleaning sessions. I also appreciate the 12-month warranty and the responsive after-sale service, adding an extra layer of confidence in my purchase.Overall, the Transmart vacuum cleaner is a top-tier cquality hoice for anyone seeking a powerful, lightweight, and versatile cleaning tool. I've used Dyson and Shark before and the performance of this Transmart vacuum cleaner is defintiely on par. It's transformed my cleaning routine, making it quicker and more efficient. A fantastic investment for a cleaner, healthier home. Thumbs up!",

Didn\u2019t want to spend a ton on a Dyson so I got this. And omg. It\u2019s amazing. It sucks very well and also sweeps at the same time so it\u2019s actually extra clean compared to my previous vacuum ( just sucking ). Def a good upgrade without breaking the bank !",

The suction on this vacuum is laughable, even using the turbo button! It's already been packed back up and will be returned tomorrow. If I could give it no stars, I would.
