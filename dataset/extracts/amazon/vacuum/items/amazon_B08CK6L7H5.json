                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Its a $80 CORDLESS vacuum",
                "reviewText": "Reading through the 4-star reviews, I'm honestly not sure why they aren't 5 star for the price-point and for what you get. One comment mentioned \"cheaply made\", which is what prompted me to write this review.To start, we have a Bissel that was $200 or so and it works great. Honestly just as good if not better than our Dyson and its about half the weight. We were looking for something for small cleanup jobs and something that could be handheld and lightweight for upholstery.We purchased this vacuum on sale for around $80 since we didn't like having to whip out the Bissel for small cleanups. We tried it as soon as we bought it and was honestly very surprised at how much stuff it picked up AFTER vacuuming already! Its super lightweight, easy on the wrists, it has a controllable suction level which is something i didn't know we needed; making it perfect for rugs and mats.To address the \"cheaply made\" comment: the first thing i noticed about little vacuum was that it felt like it cost upwards of $300 easily. The materials seem like very good quality aluminum was used. Even the plastic attachments feel sturdy. Oh and its so quiet, you could have a conversation while vacuuming easily.I took it for a test run for about 15 - 20 minutes or so after a full charge and the battery level didn't move. In that time it picked up a bunch of stuff ranging from indoor rugs, outdoor rugs, carpet, tile and even the dirt that gets stuck in the sliding door tracks.Overall, a great buy and honestly a must have when you need a vacuum but don't want to unravel the cord and have to plug it into different outlets every time you run out of cord. My only negative that I noticed is that it does statically charge things quite easily. After vacuuming the couch, i noticed when moving around I would get shocked for some time afterwards. That's not worth docking a star in my opinion though. This is day one though and first impressions, however so far i'm thoroughly impressed. I will update my review based on longevity, but even if this lasts me a year or two, im happy with that.",

Super lightweight there is a lot to like. It loses a star because the battery life is short. If you run at medium speed (suction) you might get 30 minutes. Again since this is a pick up the dirt and grab surface dirt/pet hair off the carpet I get 6 or 7 \u201cruns\u201d. I\u2019d buy it again",

It is extremely difficult to bring up from the basement and then clunk around the house. I wanted something convenient to use in between, as I have two adorable kittens, who seem to leave a trail of debris wherever they go. Also for high traffic areas, door mats, hallway, kitchen tile floor. It comes with a mount, which I attached right inside the basement doorway, just grab and go. Easy to empty the canister. The battery life is fine for my purposes. In love with my new little cordless vacuum\u2026wish I had gotten it years ago! Note: it does unexpectedly well on carpets, but not for that serious deep cleaning of cat hair, ect, but that was not my expectation of this device. Happy!",

I love that it is small and lightweight, I can definitely lift it to get high hard to reach areas. Decent suction, but not as powerful as I hoped. The only real downside I would say this vacuum has is it's battery life. I have to charge it every time after vacuuming for only about 15-20 minutes at a time. Makes things inconvenient at times but I just worked the charge times in with my cleaning and that seems to work. Definitely worth it if you're looking for something small and lightweight.",
