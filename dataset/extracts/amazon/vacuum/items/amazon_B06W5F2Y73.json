And after one week decided to run this little guy .That little thing is great !I have mostly hard wood and little carpet .It picked up all the hair , it picked up sooooooo much dust I had no idea I had so much dust on the floor .And all other little objects .I\u2019m very happy that it collected dust which is not visible to eye . Cause I\u2019m very allergic to almost anything it\u2019s a great news .It does work well on carpet too .To suction is strong enough to pick up things from carpet too .After that I run my floors with just a dry mop with some spray for hard wood . Not a single little hair was picked up on the mop neither dust . So it means this vacuum cleaner really cleaned the floor from hair and dust.It makes cleaning so much easier . Cause now I can clean floors without water .Just with some antiseptic hard wood gentle spray z perfect !Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Really cheap material. Took me forever to figure out I had to basically break the handle in two just to assemble it and then I had to superglue it at he ends. The suction on it sucks because there\u2019s no bristles. Other than that, it\u2019s a great vacuum for the price.",

                "reviewText": "If it wasn't for the filter setup I would have given this 5 stars. I'll start with the cons. The debris collects around the filter. If it was just around the plastic housing I wouldn't have a problem with that but the debris goes through the plastic housing and collects around the filter. Each time I use it i have to clean and wash this filter. The filter gets \"fuzzy\" very fast. The worst part of it all is you cannot find a filter ANYWHERE. I've tried everywhere and spent lots of time trying. Don't understand why Dirt Devil would make a machine that there isn't a filter available for. Aside from the filter problem it's a GREAT machine. It's very light, easy to maneuver and has good suction. Perfect for wood and tile floors and does a good job on rugs between vacuuming. Would not recommend it because if the FILTER.",

We have 3 children under 6 and it passes the test for longevity and performance. Even under the dining table after a meal! Always check the filter which is easily accessible. Always make sure everything is seated and correctly positioned or you will not get the suction that this vacuum provides. We have a hoover wind tunnel for getting down deep on our big rugs. My wife uses this daily and it has been many months now. Easy decision here, buy it.",

I only looked at the photo in the box and I knew which parts go where. So it was very very easy and uncomplicated assembling it. I also like how I could dis-assemble the whole vacuum to clean it all, which was hard for bigger and more complicated vacuums I had before. The parts are simple and easy to clean. I opened it and it is very easy to wash. When I tried it, The suction was good enough to penetrate sucking dirt on my carpet. But the pad underneath with brushes is not included. I don't need it anyway. But you could buy yourself the brush pad. Over all, the product is a great buy.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this almost exactly one year ago, and I'm replacing it. The little plastic piece popped off that holds the removable dirt collector to the rest of the vacuum. The piece is circled in the first photo with an arrow showing where it is supposed to be. I empty it a couple of times a week as I have three parakeets, but it should still last longer than one year, I think. Also about five months ago (so not much past a year of owning it) we had to put tape around where the sweeper part attaches to the body of the vacuum because that kept fall off. In the (gross I know) 2nd photo, you can see where the taped part jams in. The part where it was supposed to click in filled with dirt that you CANNOT clean out because it's all glued together there. So it makes itself useless. Two part malfunctions in a year. Not good. Won't buy again, which is too bad because this was my 2nd Dirt Devil stick vac. The other one lasted for years and I was hoping for the same performance. (Edited to say that I give it two stars because [1] the cord is a little longer than the one I used to have, so that's helpful; and [2] it did do the job for a year.",

Anyone with arthritis or rheumatoid they will find it easy to use. Might want to leave an extension cord on it so you barely have to replug it in. But a great unit. This unit has the larger motor out of the 2 available online. So for the few extra dkars buy this model. You'll be satisfied.",
