                "reviewText": "Needed a 'real' vacuum for those times my cordless vacs aren't appropriate--like stairs, cracks/crevices, under appliances, or cobwebs, etc.Pros: light weight, good suction, dirt cup is easy to release and empty, & has onboard tools. Seems to pick up pet hair nicely.Cons:Power cord is way too short. I live in a small house, but still had to change outlets from one end of my livingroom to the other to be able to vacuum the whole room. Make sure you have an easy to access outlet in every room, or a handy extension cord.The hose is also way too short and extremely stiff. There are no hose 'extension tubes' to give it more length, so above the head cleaning is impossible unless you want to lift the entire unit in the air. Same with stairs--be prepared to lift the whole unit every 2-3 steps.The crevice tool is too short and too fat to be of much use other than in-between furniture cushions or easy to access baseboards and the like. It can't fit more than 3 inches under or between any appliances, unless you move the entire appliance. I expect it won't reach very far under/between car seats either.If a long hose and useful tools aren't important to you, this may be ok for you, as the suction capabilities are good. I'm going to keep searching for my next vacuum...",

Picked up A LOT the first time and continues to do a great job with cleaning. I don't have stairs but I do have hardwood and carpet and works fine on both. Great suction with the wand as well for the behind areas like couches and tv as well as base boards. Highly recommend this!!!",

This baby can find more dirt. Even better than a politician\u2019s opponent. The only thing I can say about it on the flip side. The high pitch sound it produces. But I get it. It\u2019s due to the engineering. Like a leaf blower. If you want the power, then you get use to the sound. If not, ear buds or some good tunes might help. Other than that I would recommend it. I\u2019m hoping this first round of Mrs. Doubtfiring around the house will have more sequels than Lucas films. Oh, the power cord has plenty of length. Pretty much like listening to celebrities award speeches. Or my review, wink. For an average sized home with average sized rooms. Thank you again Eureka for living up to your name.",

                "reviewText": "While this vacuum has decent suction and is easy to empty, if I had to do over, I'd spend more money for a better vacuum. Yes, it lightweight (easy to carry up the stairs) but if you are using the attachment tools don't expect it to stay upright. The stretch hose is too short so when you pull on it the least little bit, the vacuum tips over. Forget trying to vacuum your stairs with this thing. The electrical cord is SO SHORT. No going from 1 room to another without changing outlets. And the canister is too small especially if you have pets that shed.If you live in a very small apartment or house, and cost is a factor, then this may be for you. But if not, I suggest you look for a better model. Sometimes being cheaper is too cheap. This one is going to the garage and I'll find a better one (more pros than cons) for my upstairs vacuum.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter did her research and discovered this vacuum cleaner. Her thinking was to check the 3-star reviews on all the vacuum cleaners and those will tell you what, if anything, is wrong with the product. Then she read the 4-star and 5-star reviews and was impressed so she bought this one. She loved how light and easy it was to use along with the strong suction. She vacuumed one room and filled the canister.She told her mom who told me about it. I read the 5-star reviews myself and was compelled to buy this vacuum and test it for myself, thinking, how could such a low-priced vacuum cleaner be so good? So, I vacuumed our bedroom with our higher-end Kenmore upright, which I thought was quite decent, and then followed by using this Eureka vacuum. Well, I filled half a canister with fine dust, fluff, and hair. Wow!So, I bought one for my mother-in-law and vacuumed her family room a few hours after she vacuumed it. She noticed her carpet was looking newer since the carpet fibres were standing up (from the suction). I examined the canister which was 3/4 full, and saw some fluff, a little hair but a lot of fine dust and what looked like super fine sand. She was impressed and since she had trouble with her elbow she loved how light and easy it was to use.So, Eureka has 3 loyal customers. Great design and engineering on this powerful and easy-to-use vacuum cleaner. To those who find it difficult to push, set the carpet pile one notch higher. You have to realize that with super suction comes a little effort to push but pulling is super easy. You can't have great suction without a little effort. Just remember to go slowly forward and backward to let the vibration and suction do their thing.In my opinion, this does a better job than $800 (even $2000) vacuum cleaners so I'm planning on buying a spare (or two) soon!",
