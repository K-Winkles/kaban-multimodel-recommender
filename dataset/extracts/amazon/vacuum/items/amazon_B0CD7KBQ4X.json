                "reviewText": "For a stick mop/vacuum, I have mixed feelings. Honestly, it really isn't worth the work or the $40.00. The vacuum is just a dust buster with a short cord, and the mop is a sponge pad with a tiny water reservoir. Filling it is a pain in the neck. The rubber gasket is insanely difficult to remove and install, the tank leaked and it doesn't hold much water. If you don't put some sort of cleaner in the tank or carry a spray bottle around, it doesn't clean anything. Furthermore, I highly doubt that the vacuum is wet rated, so constantly sucking up small amounts of water risks eventually destroying the vacuum, even if you are cleaning and drying the filter. The suction power is impressive however, and using just as a vacuum is acceptable, the cord is dramatically too short though. Cheap materials, poorly executed, and overall a waste of time. Maybe if you have a really small apartment or cabin, this may be advantageous. I have used it several times and end up cleaning the wood floors again because they just didn't get clean. I would rather just vacuum and steam mop once, so likely won't be using it again. It will find its new home in the camper where its small size and dual function can really be appreciated. I can't justify giving it less stars, simply because it doesn't advertise itself to be anything other than what it is. It did exactly what it stated, I just think conceptually it is a terrible idea.",

                "reviewText": "I don't tend to break out the giant upright vacuum out that often for a couple reasons (way too bulky, and way too loud compared to my Shark sweeper which gets similar results). However, every now and then, you just have to get the actual vacuum cleaner out. This is a neat one that can do both what the upright unit can do, as well as a handheld unit.Despite what the picture shows, you actually get three filters, not just two. It's powered from the wall, but it has a pretty long cable (about 16ft), so it's not too big of a deal. Since it is such a small device, that does unfortunately make it pretty noisy, but still not as loud as my full upright cleaner. I'd say it's a bit louder than my handheld Shark cleaner. That being said, this thing has way more power to it than either of my Shark cleaners. So much so that on a denser bit of carpet, it actually got a bit stuck! On the looser carpet though, it handled just fine. I don't have enough exposed hard flooring to try the mop out, so I can't review that.Switching from the upright to the handheld mode is just as simple as removing the dust tank and actual vacuum unit itself from the handle and the base, so just reverse the process you did to put it together. Having this two in one design is super convenient. One thing I will say is that I wish it had some sort of rotating brush to agitate the floor a bit, so that even more dust could be picked up, but it works well enough without it.I'm really happy with this. It's got the power you'd expect from an upright, while being a bit quieter, and way smaller. It won't fully replace the Shark sweeper, but it might replace the full upright vacuum cleaner for me.",
