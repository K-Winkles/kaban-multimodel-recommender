I love my other one so much that I decided to buy this one just to keep downstairs.My only gripe about this vacuum is the folding feature. It\u2019s not that intuitive and it\u2019s awkward. My other vacuum has a hook on the wand that you hang the motor portion of the vacuum. It\u2019s simple and easy to maneuver.It took me a while to figure out how to unlock this one from the folded position. And, it also took a min to find the charging lights.Overall, great suction, great battery life, and sturdy design. I just wish the folding mechanism was better. I would recommend.",

They have the audacity to sell me a broken product and refund me literally $0.01 and listed the remaining $168 dollars as a restocking fee. They also lied about receiving the item at first they said it wasn\u2019t in original condition then days later they stated that they received the wrong item. I asked for answers and reached out but they ignore me so I had to reach out to Amazon. Save yourself the headache and prevent dealing with this scam, DO NOT BUY.",
