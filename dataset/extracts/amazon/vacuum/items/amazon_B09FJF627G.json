                "reviewText": "7-month update:I did have to clean the brush roll on the Rose vacuum once last week. It's the hair-shedding season and I delayed grooming the Goldens too long. But removing the hair was much easier with the channel that allows the scissors under the hair.Also, for those who complain that they are going through bags quickly when they first get this vacuum, understand that your old vacuum was not cleaning your house properly so this vacuum has to play catch up and you will use more bags in the beginning. It should level out once your house is properly cleaned. The bags hold a lot of debris and are full each time I replace them. Much more efficient than the canister vacuum I had which left half the bag empty.Full disclosure I am a multiple vacuum owner. I have a Miele upright(over 10 yrs.), a Kenmore canister(over 13 yrs.), and a Samsung Jet90 with the auto clean station for quick pickups. I don't like carrying vacuums up and down the stairs. This new vacuum is replacing the Kenmore canister.I have had the green BU4022 model for over a year. It works excellently being easy to maneuver and the lift-off feature is handy, but the brush roll fills with hair and is not easy to clean. I did clean it just before taking the picture. It has a green brush.I received the Rose BU4050 yesterday and the features are all the same except for the brush roll bar. This does not collect hair as the other one does. You can see in my picture the new vacuum has channels on the brush roll. If the performance changes with more use I will update my review.A few things you might want to know about both models:1) You have to remove the power cord from the side to remove the canister from the base or to be able to use the attachments with the handle/hose. The cord hooks are near the top of the handle and at the bottom of the canister unit. This is a design flaw in my opinion. They could have put both hooks on the canister.2) The brush roll stops in the upright position without pushing the button.3) The vacuum is easy to maneuver, but it will not fit under a standard-height bed.4) NO issues with the hose coming apart from the green vacuum that I have had for over a year.5) The suction power on both is fantastic, they will lift my area rugs. You can adjust this with the vent door on the handle.6) The attachments are standard in quality and functionality. There are two attachment holders on the back of the canister, but the attachments tend to fall off.7) The hands-free bag disposal is fine, the bags are nice and help to keep the dirt sealed in the vacuum which keeps the air cleaner.8) Someone asked about the air vents on the front. They are for the Hepa filter. Just pull out from the bottom to remove the cover. See photos.9) You can also purchase an extension wand from Kenmore. The handle wand does not extend. It is 30 inches measured from the disconnection point at the handle. The handle is 8 inches from the grip to the wand connection point. So it gives you about 38 inches of reach without an extra extension piece.I gave this 5 stars because it does clean well, it's light weight and uses bags. With three dogs (two are Goldens), and a house bunny, my vacuums get a workout. If you have long-haired dogs or humans get the BU4050. Who cares about the color if your house gets clean and you don't have to constantly clean the brush roll?Both were purchased with my own money, my only bias is that I still like vacuums that use bags.",

I hope it stands up to my abuse!!It goes from rug to bare floor with a push of a button, it sucks every piece of cat litter up n does not blow it across the other side of room, no dust blowing out, the attachments are so easy, long cord n light is ideal! The soft pink color is nice, only thing I wish for is that it beat my rugs better! But it definitely doing the job!!!",

                "reviewText": "After going through various \"High end\" vacuum cleaners that could not handle my daily vacuuming of a shed heavy dog, and being disappointed by all of them. I remembered how well our old Kenmoore from the 1980s worked and amazingly ran well for almost 30 years. Knowing sears was out of business i just assumed the Kenmore brand was long gone. To my surprise it wasn't.Now i don't expect this vacuum to last like the old American made Sears one did, but I'll tell you this, it works surprisingly good, it's been 4 days since my vacuum died , so my floors are pretty hairy. This vacuum managed to pick it all up on mostly the first pass.Pros-Vacuum has a pivot at the base which makes turning corners really easy and convenient-reletively quite for the power-good filtration system-not to big not to small-being able to easily remove the wand and canister with easy to press clearly market buttons is nice-manual control over roller on/off button-suction control-headlight-longer chord than expectedCons:-heavier than expected which is fine, but it is a bit harder to push than any vacuum I've ever owned-does not have a way to store all 4 attachments on the Vacuum so the wide appolstry attachment and and small pet attachment must be stored somewhere-the 2 attachments that do store on the vacuum don't really fit or secure very well-Who picks these colors? Don't be fooled the Red one you have the option to select is NOT the same model as the metallic rose one. So your only option is the pinkish metallic color. It doesn't look as bad in person as it does in these pictures, but it's still a color I'm guessing maybe 1 in 100 people would actually like.-the roller is not some special magical invention, it almost looks like it has plastic teeth in the pictures, this is just a modern roller designed for pet hair like many vacuums already offer.",

                "reviewTitle": "Not-so nice little vacuum",
                "reviewText": "Update: I thought I just had to get used to it, but it's not that. It won't suck up cat hair / hair / floof from a very short-pile carpet, even going over it repeatedly. I have to go around after it picking up bits manually after vacuuming. For a $300+ vacuum it's absurd. Contacted support. If they don't have a resolution it's going back.Pros\u2022 The light on the front is great. It shows just how dirty things are, and how clean they are after! Satisfying. Now to do something about those carpet stains it pointed out....\u2022 Nice small footprint - it's not as fat as I expected based on other reviews. It's more... slightly chubby. The narrow foot helps get in tight places that a bigger vac wouldn't.\u2022 The handle comes off and can be used with attachments without the extender wand. This is really nice for just quickly doing the couch or bed frame. The slinky flexible hose has a really nice feel to it and seems well made.\u2022 It sucks up the dirt, dust, hair, fur and kitty litter nicely, and the brush roll had no hair stuck in it after my first round. That's worth the extra price right there.\u2022 There's a quick release for the cord at the top, so you don't need to unwind it manually. You still have to wind it back on, but at least this takes some of the hassle out. It's a good compromise for a manual cord management system.Quirks\u2022 The brush roll indicator light turns green when it's off and turns off when the brush roll is active. This is opposite what it should be (intuitively). However you can see the roll through the little window, so it's easy to tell if it's turning even without the indicator.Cons\u2022 It's doesn't turn all that well. Maybe I just need to get used to it after my canister vac, but I had to do the 'pick-up and swivel' thing a few times in smaller areas\u2022 I saw in another review that the front cover over the hepa filter comes off. However, unless I'm missing something, it doesn't come off easily at all. It's going to take some serious prying (like opening a laptop for the first time). This is annoying, because the HEPA filter will need changing at some point.\u2022 There doesn't appear to be an option between just the handle & hose and the long extender. Would be nice to have a middle option, but it's not a dealbreaker.\u2022 It's a bit heavier than I expected. It's marketed as lightweight, but it also says \"under 14lbs\". It's 14.2lbs on my scale assembled, and the detached part is 10.2lbs. So while it's not heavy, it's also not a featherweight. It takes some muscle to wrangle it around. But it's got bags, so compromises must be made.",
