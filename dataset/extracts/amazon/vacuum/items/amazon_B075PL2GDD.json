                "reviewText": "I renovated my house 5 years ago and have had bare floors for the first time in my life. It's been a hit and miss game to find a cleaning system that works for them. I had a Dyson vacuum for the carpet but it turns out that it doesn't work very well on bare floors. I was using a shop vacuum from my garage but that thing is so awkward and big to lug around. I decided to get a tank vacuum instead of an upright because I needed something that got into crevices and the wands on the uprights are so inconvenient to take in and out of the handle (the Dyson is good for being annoying in this regard).Since Bissell is a brand that I knew, I got this model because it was a small tank and it has wheels on the bottom so that it just slides around with me. First, the vacuum is easy to put together. You just slide the hose and wand together and place it on the tank. This is a bagged vacuum and Bissell thoughtfully put the first bag in the vacuum for you so you can see how it goes together and can use it right off the bat. I've had bagless tank vacuums and those things were terrible to clean. I have a cat and random litter that she tracked out of the litter box just ruined the bagless tanks and caused a smell that I could never get rid of even when cleaning. Having a bag just eliminates the dust and general mess.What I like about this vacuum is the little features that I didn't know it had. These make the vacuum incredibly convenient for me (which means I'll use it more often):1) The cord is contained within the vacuum itself and retracts back in when you're done with it. I don't have to straighten the electrical cords anymore! Unless you've had to try to unkink an electrical cord every time you use a vacuum, you have no idea how nice this is. The cord is longer than other cords I've seen on this type of vacuum but you would still need an extension cord if you don't want to plug and unplug every time you go to a new room.2) A feature which I've never seen on a vacuum before is that you can adjust the suction from very low to very high and anywhere in between using the dial on the front. This allows you to avoid sucking in curtains, fabrics and cat toys into your vacuum when you're trying to clean them (the curtains, not the cat toys).3) There are two attachments - one is a small upholstery brush to use for curtains, your couch, etc. The other is a crevice tool with a brush on it that is exactly the right width to go in the tracks of your window frames. I've spent a long time trying to find a convenient way to clean those tracks and now I have one.4) There are only three buttons on this thing - power, button to retract the cord and the suction. The buttons and the dials are very big so if an older person who had arthritis problems or other issues with their hands, this vacuum would work great for them.5) The wand retracts more than what is shown in the picture. It retracts to a length that is more than comfortable for a person to stand upright and vacuum.6) There is a large lever on the sweeper end that you can use to switch from bare floor to carpet and back again. However, this vacuum is really better for bare floors (tile, wood, etc.) than it is for carpeting. It would take a while to vacuum a large carpeted room and it seems to take quite a bit of effort to push on the carpet even with the correct switch engaged. You'll want to go back to an upright if you have carpet.7) Having said that, I do have carpeted stairs going to the basement and this worked GREAT for that. The vacuum is incredibly light and you can just carry it with you when you go up and down stairs. Again, this would work really well for an older person.8) There are three wheels on the bottom of the vacuum. Two big ones on the end and a small one right in the middle of the vacuum. The smaller wheel enables the vacuum to lay horizontal as you're dragging it around.9) There is a bag change indicator light on the front that turns orange when you need to change the bag. I haven't had this before and have had some dust-ups (pun intended) when I tried to change a bag that was too full on another vacuum.10) The vacuum has a pretty small profile so storing it has not been a problem.Things you may want to think about:1) The vacuum requires two different filters. I haven't had to clean the filters yet because this vacuum is so new. The two filters and their Bissel part numbers are pre-motor filter (203-8426) and post-motor filter (203-8427). According to the manual, the filters are removable, can be washed by hand and then replaced. I assume you would only need to buy new filters if they became damaged or torn in some fashion.2) This is a bagged vacuum (Bissel part number 213-8425). The vacuum comes with three bags already (one inside and two extra). Amazon sells the bags and the price is more than reasonable. Just put in that part number and you will find plenty of bag options.2) This is a vacuum for your house only. It would not stand up to cleaning your garage or any outside application. The manual specifically says that trying to vacuum things like large rocks, plaster, concrete or ashes will damage the motor. You could use it to vacuum the inside of your car but if you've got a large amount of the materials listed above in the car, you won't want to use it for that either.",

                "reviewText": "I got this primarily to vacuum my dogs. That's right - I have two very large, very shedding dogs. A first gen Labradoodle - 1st gen don't always get the poodle coat. Mine didn't. He sheds. A LOT. I know people say their dogs shed, but seriously, this guy takes it to a whole new level. The other dog is a Rottweiler, who also sheds, but it's a \"normal\" amount.I have a robot vacuum, but it cannot cope with the volume of dog hair even running daily. The bin is always full. If I'm home when it runs I empty it twice while it's running. This is currently 4 days a week. The other three it gets emptied daily.Neither of our dogs are really afraid of the vacuum (before I had the robot one) so I figured it wouldn't be a stretch to get them acclimated to being vacuumed. So I ordered this and an attachment specifically designed to brush/vac a dog. The attachment was a waste. In the end I use the hose of this vacuum, without an attachment. Both dogs love it.However, the Rottie, she's obsessed. She begins barking excitedly as soon as I turn the vacuum on. I do use this to vacuum surfaces and corners where the robot can't quite manage - shelves, entertainment center, couches, corners, etc. My Rottie can't wait till it's her turn. And even when I'm done with her and move on the the non-Doodle Doodle, she is still trying to get in on the action. Bot dogs mad the \"oh that feels SO good\" face - seems to me it scratches the itch that they can never reach!Now - how does this little guy perform as an actual vacuum as opposed to a dog grooming implement? Surprisingly well! It has really powerful suction. Works great on all the items I mentioned. I haven't used it with the floor attachment but I can imagine that the folks who complain about it on carpet didn't read the description very well - there is no powered brush attachment and the suction is so powerful that I wouldn't even try to use it on carpet except with the crevice tool around baseboards, corners etc - I have all hard surface floors so this won't ever be something I do. I also can't speak to the length of the extension for the floor tool because I haven't used it - our robot vac does that job. The extensions do look short though so I can't imagine trying to vacuum my whole house with this - but I can see using them to take out cobwebs!As a lightweight, powerful hard floor vacuum, being used for everything BUT the bulk of the floor, I give this high marks. As a dog-grooming device I'm thrilled - the amount of fur and (shudder) dander that I dumped from the bin was a real eye-opener - and that's before I got to tapping out the filter (OMG that was disgusting!). I would not use this on small dogs.... the suction is powerful enough that you could probably lift a dog of 10lbs or less off the floor. But for my large dogs (+/-100lbs each), it's amazing. They love it, it gets the shed and hopefully it'll help cut down on the wear on our robot vac. It's also small enough that it tucks into our already packed hall closet easily. It rolls smoothly on the floor and even when I took it all over it didn't get tangled in it's cord. I also love that the cord retracts into the body of the machine. Between this and the robot vac, I will likely never use our expensive water basin vacuum again!If you're looking for something to get corners, cobwebs; to vacuum furniture and even large dogs, I don't think you can go wrong with this... just be prepared for your dog to become an addict.",

I got this vacuum for my 3 bedroom apartment which has hardwood floors and one decorative carpet in the living room.Pros - It is significantly stronger than the last vacuum I got from Wallmart for a similar price. I am impressed with how well it sucks up cat hair and dust from the carpet and regular floor. Some reviews mentioned the cord isn't long enough but it is more than long enough for me and seems like a very regular length of cord for a vacuum.Cons- It only comes with 2 sections of stiff pipe and could use a 3rd for tall people or to reach ceiling corners. It is also pretty loud.",
