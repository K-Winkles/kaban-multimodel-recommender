                "reviewText": "I purchased this a month ago, about 2 weeks after I got it the battery died and would not recharge. I emailed back and forth with the retailer and they tried \"helping\" but nothing they told me to do would help, they also would take 3-4 days to get back to me. When I finally asked for a replacement part they, of course, were out of stock and would let me know when they get a new one in. That was 8 days ago...Tried filing a claim with asurion (the insurance you can purchase with the vacuum) and they told me I had to reach out to the retailer.Not to mention it would literally get clogged sucking up cat hair... NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE",

                "reviewText": "Pretty nice,easy to install and didn't really need the instructions to put together. Comes with 3 filters which was awesome. Nice white and used on my rug, tile. Hardwood floors. For the price I saved a lot and way more easier to clean than constantly bending over with a dust pan. Has a nice led light in dark spots. Great buy. Would definitely recommend.My only reason for not giving a five star because the head is very flimsy lol and it doesn't stand on its own.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this vacuum for my cat room. I have multiple cats and was hoping this vacuum would be great to use daily to pick up litter and cat hair off my hard surface floor. Unfortunately, it did not take much to clog up the tube so this vacuum is not going to work for me. I believe the problem is the tubing is too narrow to handle much. I am returning it. That said, it is a nice little vacuum if you want to use it for light dusting and clean up around the house. I wish it would have worked better for what I needed.",
