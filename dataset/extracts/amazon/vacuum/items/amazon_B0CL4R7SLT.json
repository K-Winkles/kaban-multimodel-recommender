                "reviewText": "I mainly have vinyl flooring but I have a rug that catches everything and I needed something. This was great cause you can use on multiple surfaces and you can break it down to store. I have a tiny apartment and storage is a challenge.Only thing for me is that there no rotating brush its a rubber squeegee type thing, works great on hard surfaces but on a few of my rugs I have to manually pick some items up because there no brush to help loosen the debris from the carpet. But after a few passes it works.If I had more carpet than hard floors this wouldn't work for me.",
