                "reviewText": "Extremely good value for a stick vac. The plastics are thick and sturdy like a Dyson we used to have, the down-tube extends and contracts smoothly, the brush head pivots freely and smoothly and has a good light for finding debris on hardwood floors, and the suction is pretty darned good in high-speed mode. Works very well on our hardwood floors, and even works well on our short berber throw rugs. Comes with a sturdy plastic hanger and a wall-wart charger which plugs directly into the battery. The battery has its own indicator lights when charging, and the battery life appears to match the claims at this early point in its life. In the first couple of days, we've have no trouble vacuuming five downstairs rooms with hardwood floors without needing a recharge.",
