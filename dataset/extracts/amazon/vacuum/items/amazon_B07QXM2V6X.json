                "reviewText": "Disclosures: I reside in a 2- story home with wood and porcelain tile floors. The carpeting is limited to low pile area rugs within the bedrooms. I use the S9 on the 1st floor while a Roomba model 770 vacuums the upstairs. My review will be limited to the S9 performance on hard floors with little in the way of carpet.Pros:\u2022 The S9 has run flawlessly after solving a few initial problems (error codes for Roomba\u2019s bin is full and close the lid when neither issue was in fact true). Cleans corners, moderately small sized rugs so much better than previous roombas.\u2022 More efficient, and therefore faster cleaning, with newer technology. Greatly improves cleaning on floors by systematically cleaning floors as opposed to previous algorithms that appear random, and unnecessarily time consuming. In my use, It\u2019s been uncommon for the S9 to miss debris on the floor.\u2022 S9 does away with light boxes. Clean a single room of choice, such as the kitchen, by a few taps on the app. much less prep is required.\u2022 Ability to set up \u201cstay out\u201d areas where sensitive objects are positioned.\u2022 Object recognition: greatly reduces he amount of banging into furniture. Although previous roombas would slow down before contacting a wall, furniture isn\u2019t as fortunate. The S9 is gentle around all obstructions. Although it might occur, I\u2019ve yet to see the S9 run headlong into chair or table legs or other obstructions.\u2022 Self-cleaning: I didn\u2019t think I would be as happy with this feature as I am. In fact, I think it may be the greatest improvement Roomba has made. The S9 and cleaning base has (when sold together, model number is S9+ ) practically eliminated the routine of manually pulling hair and dust out of the brushes. Although the time may come, I\u2019ve yet to have to clean the bristles since its 1st run on Christmas day. I never knew how much I hated that chore until it was no longer required.\u2022 Much more, but these features are, to me at least, the most significant. It has (somewhat) won over my wife. She will now typically pay Roomba a grudging compliment after it has run.Cons:\u2022 Price. No way around it, this is an expensive device to vacuum the floor. And it will never clean baseboards or stairs or get into every tiny nook or cranny on the floor as a manual vacuum cleaner will.\u2022 Operating noise. Not much progress has been made by irobot in-regards to operating noise abatement. Don\u2019t expect to get much sleep if the S9 is vacuuming in or adjacent to your bedroom.\u2022 Increased complexity. My S9 ran into several persistent error codes that took a considerable amount of time to solve. If you don\u2019t enjoy occasionally tinkering and troubleshooting should your Roomba run into a problem, then purchasing a S9 may not be the right choice. On a positive note, Roomba customer services has been stellar, in my experience. Two calls were answered in under 3 minutes and the tech was professional and knowledgeable. However I recognize that it is difficult to make sweeping statements with a sample size of 2 calls; merely reporting my experiences as positive. after solving these initial teething problems, the S9 has run and docked without intervention and without any errors.If you aren't a fan of household chores, the S9 fits in your budget, and you don't mind or enjoy an opportunity to problem solve, then think you should consider it. be advised that the Miele C2 kicks butt for lesshope this helps",

                "reviewText": "First this thing is loud. The rubber scrapers/rollers squeak on our floors. It's pretty annoying, I even use it a my alarm clock now.While it is loud when cleaning your floors there is nothing that compares to when it empties into the base. High pitched vacuum noise as loud or louder than my shop vacuum. I am not exaggerating.I had a $180 Shark that was dumb as a rock, banged hard into everything, not as loud and cleaned as well. This is supposed to replace the Shark.___________________On the Seventh day...After it woke me up it vacuumed for a bit and did it's 'I stopped vacuuming for a reason' beep. I had some things to do so I checked the app. It showed it was still cleaning. But it wasn't.Eventually I remembered it exists and found it. I pressed clean and it would not resume. So I put it on the dock and it still showed it was cleaning as it was charging.Came back and the Roomba didnt respond to either the app nor the 'clean' button.It needed a reboot. Held the 'clean' button for 20 seconds and it rebooted. Still nothing. I waited again. Pressed the 'clean' button again and it finally started to reboot. It told me it had an error 15, some internal error it was able to clear on its own. But no clue what it was.Finally it starts working again and I set it to clean again.Seven days and this thing already had an internal error. $600 gamble if this will happen again. I'm going to exchange this one. I don't feel like dealing with a deteriorating unit which may fail outside of the 30 day azon return period and get a refurbished unit from a warranty return with iRobot.Update: Since I posted I still ran the vacuum to see if things that happened were a fluke. Maybe my expectations were too high? I've come to find out they really aren't.So, the vacuum tried to 'mount' the dock. No, not in the I'm going home to charge and empty my bag. Nope, it decided to hump the dock at an approach angle of 45\u00b0, then after a minute of rocking up and down it backed off, spun around 360\u00b0 and started it again. This happened 4-5 times before I picked it up and placed it away from the dock.Something else I've learned is that everytime something gets stuck in the brushes I need to clear the brushes and then put it back on the dock to 'reset' it. Pressing the clean button will not get it to start cleaning again. It just toots its cheery little tune and sits there. I did not have this problem with the Shark that the Roomba replaced.The worst part of it is that after being on the dock it will not pick up the job where it left off. So half the floor is clean. If I set it to clean again it starts with cleaning the area it has already cleaned.I run this vacuum once a day. I can count on my hand the number of days that this vacuum has run trouble free for me and still have 3 fingers left over.Update, again (2 months): Do not buy this junk. It literally said it was stuck on a ledge... In the middle of our hardwood floor. Nothing around it.Now it has taken to trying to empty it's bin before it starts a job, repeatedly. Today it was 3 times in succession before I pulled it off it's dock. What programming says keep emptying your bin multiple times before you start a job. And the vacuum's bin is already empty. Who programs these things?------------Update 11/24/23It is officially no longer working. It had a fault stating that the bumper was jammed and to tap it a few times to loosen it. I tapped it, and tapped it and tapped it some more. No change. Put it on the dock. No change. Rebooted it. No change. Tapped it again. No change. Rebooted it again. Yes, finally change. It moved a few feet from the dock and spun in a circle for about a minute and then the error of stuck bumper is back.I give up.I will continue to update all the new faults I discover until Amazon makes it unable for me to edit this review.",

                "reviewText": "Review one year and a half later:1) The quality of customer service at iRobot is unequaled. 2) I recently tried another product that was supposed to be the best according to PC Magazine. This other product was finally very disappointing. In particular, iRobot was far superior to make a map and this other brand, which claimed to wash the floor at the same time, still has work to do to fill its promises.Review when I purchased it:iRobot Roomba s9+ takes some time to map the floor, and it doesn't always do what we think it should do. My advice is : leave it alone! Let it do its work and clear the place as much as possible. Press the map button, then the 3 dots, then mapping run. Do it at least 3 times (you have to do it at least 3 times). This will take a lot of time (for 1500 sqf). Let it work! Thereafter, this device will work perfectly. I am delighted.N.B. The first time, I left the chairs and other little things (flower pots) in their place. I was disappointed with the result. The plan wasn't perfect. The second time, I took as many things as possible off the floor and put them somewhere else. After giving an almost perfect floor... I had a perfect plan! If you are demanding with the robot, you must give it what it needs to meet your requirements.",
