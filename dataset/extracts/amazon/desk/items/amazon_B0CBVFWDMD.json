I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to put this desk together. The directions are precise and easy to understand. All the items that were supposed to be included, were. Everything was clearly marked as to which part it was and where is was supposed to go. When putting the desk together, the holes were where they were supposed to be - imagine that! The drawer is made of a heavy duty nylon - I have desk supply tray in that drawer that works perfectly. The outlets and port on the upper shelf are really handy - it's nice they're off to the side of the upper shelf. For the ease of construction and quality of materials, this desk is truly worth every penny. I'm extremely happy with my desk.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the 40 inch desk as I had a very small spot to put it. It fits very nicely. The desk was really pretty easy to assemble, I only made 1 mistake at the beginning by not lining the holes up on the main legs. Other than that all the holes lined up nicely and I was able to put it together all by myself. I love the build in plug ins, it saves a lot of cords running behind it.It has plenty of room for my big monitor and my laptop opened as a separate monitor. I don't really use the higher stand for my monitors (I'm getting old and like my monitors closer to me).Really my only complaint is the keyboard tray. On the 40 inch model a full size keyboard with number pad and a mouse is a tight fit. If I ever need to order another keyboard, I'll probably skip the number pad and then it will have plenty of room. A full size keyboard fits but it's tight with a mouse. Also, the keyboard tray slides so smoothly, that it tends to slide in as I'm typing on it. I've just added a clothes pin to the side to help with this issue.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a better desk for my home office. Since I work from home, it had to be something large enough to give me the space I need but not so large that it takes up the room. This was the perfect solution!!!Pros:Size is amazing, adjustable monitor ledge, keyboard drawer, drawer and shelves. I worried about the sturdiness of a fabric drawer, but it's been great so far.Cons:The keyboard tray needs to be a little higher. I sit high in my chair so it's a little low for me. If you sit low, it's not an issue.Construction can be tricky. Make sure to pay really close attention to the directions if you care which side the shelves are on. I put it together and had to take it apart because I looked at the instructions incorrectly. Otherwise, construction was not bad.Overall, I would buy this desk again and recommend to anyone who asked.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to fit in a small space to start a fully remote job. I can see how it would be hard to assemble solo in the beginning just holding the parts while trying to screw things in but directions were simple to follow and it even had an extra screw of each type which came in handy cause one screw it the batch had no threads. We actually put the top shelf on facing away rather than over the desk to give more space on top and because it fit to extend over a ledge to be flush with the wall. The draw works well even though the sides of it are fabric and the whole desk is sturdy. Supports 2 monitors on the shelf and i love access to the plugs on top for my phone. Overall really happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm old, and I've assembled a lot of furniture, but I've never had a complex item that went together as smoothly as this. It helped that all of the parts were machined properly and there were no misalignments. More important, though, the manufacturer clearly labeled every item rather than just showing a picture and leaving it for the customer to figure out. Instead of the usual sheet with some sketches, this desk came with a manual that showed every step in detail, and which parts (by number) would be required. The process went so well that I actually enjoyed it. The finished product seems more sturdy than most assemble-it-yourself projects.",
