                "reviewText": "After a long search for the perfect standing desk, I stumbled upon the Flexispot Electric Standing Desk with dual motors, and it has been a complete game-changer for my home office setup.Delivery: The process was smooth and well-coordinated. The tabletop arrived first, followed by the legs after two days. I was impressed with the packaging; both components were securely packed, ensuring no damage during transit.Setup: This was a bit of a mixed bag. The instructions provided were clear to a certain extent, but I searched for an online setup video for extra assurance. A small suggestion for Flexispot: including a QR code linking to a setup video would be a great addition for tech-savvy users. The assembly started off as a one-person job, but I needed an extra hand when it came to flipping the tabletop for drilling. The pre-drilled holes were a nice touch, although they required a bit of tweaking before the screws could be fitted in perfectly.Quality: The quality of this desk is top-notch. The legs are robust and convey a sense of durability. I opted for the black frame paired with a walnut butcher block top, and it's nothing short of stunning. The desk is a standout piece in my office, so much so that I'm reluctant to use a mousepad just to preserve its beauty! The keypad is user-friendly, and I didn't even need to refer to the manual to program the buttons.Functionality: Flexispot has done an excellent job with the functionality of this desk. The anti-collision feature is reliable, and the desk adjusts its height quietly and smoothly. It effortlessly supports my 34-inch monitor, which weighs around 15 lbs. Even at its highest setting, the desk maintains stability with minimal wobble \u2013 a common issue in many standing desks, even those at higher price points.Height Range: As someone who is 5'2\", I've had no issues with the desk's height range. It's versatile enough to cater to a wide range of users \u2013 I can easily see a young child using this desk comfortably at its lowest setting, making it a great option for families.Conclusion: The Flexispot Electric Standing Desk is an excellent investment for anyone looking to upgrade their home office. It strikes the perfect balance between aesthetics, quality, and functionality without breaking the bank. Whether you're a professional working from home or someone who values ergonomics and design, this desk is a fantastic choice. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I have only have this for about a week and I already love it! As stated when ordered it arrived in 2 deliveries which was good to know. The desk was easy to assemble, it took about an hour, and the instructions were easy to follow. I choose this desk for several reasons, 1. I wanted the 55x28 size, 2. the dual motor and 3. I wanted the top to be one solid service. The reviews were also good. The desk raises and lowers smoothly and quietly. There is no shaking or vibration that disturbs my coffee and the motor can\u2019t be hear when I am on a call. I am happy I choose the 55x28, there is plenty of surface space even with 2 monitors. The look of the desk is also very nice. I choose the mahogany top but I am sure they all look great. I am happy I finally decided to get this desk. I really love it.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time having a standing desk and I love how quiet the motor is, the fact that I can save 3 heights, the amount of leg space, and that this desk goes up to 50\". I'm in medical school, so I am on my desk for hours studying and doing work. I used to have a non-standing desk and I would be sitting down for hours on end which would cause me back pain and lead me to become easily fatigue. With this desk, the option of standing up is not only beneficial to my health but wakes me up, helps me be more productive, and has helped diminished my back pain during study sessions.The desk does come in separate packages (2) as stated in other reviews. The legs arrived first and the desktop arrived the next day. It is easy to assemble following the instructions, though you will need help to attach the desktop as it is VERYY heavy.I love that the order comes with cable organizers to attach to the bottom of the desk so that the under the desk space does not look crazy with cables. I also love the mahogany top that I got, it looks so beautiful and I getting excited to work at my desk.",

                "reviewText": "I've fallen in love with using my sit/stand desk at work but I didn't want to compromise on quality for a home version and I couldn't spend thousands of dollars.My friend has the 48in version and she loves hers, even so, I was nervous going up to the 60in version.I received this yesterday, and assembled it today. I'm impressed already. It was well packed, the instructions were easy to follow and it took less than an hour to assemble by myself. It is heavy in the package, and to move when fully assembled so I did need my wife to help with that.The motor is smooth and much quieter than my desk at work. I believe this will hold up for many years, and the cost on sale was a steal for the quality. I believe it meets or exceeds the quality of my work desk, for less than $400 dollars. I can't beat that.",

The instructions could use improvement as I had to look up a video to understand how the sliding piece along the bottom works and I would recommend lacing the cable wires for the dial-pad before you screw in the bottom or you will have to do your cable management over the bump along the bottom.Overall good desk but much time could be saved if the instructions had a few more close up photos and informed the customer about cable wiring.",
