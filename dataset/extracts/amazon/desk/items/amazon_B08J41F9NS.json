                "reviewText": "This desk is a very good value. I've been using one for work for about 9 months. Up and down a couple times per day. I like it so much we bought another to replace a cheaper desk for my HS junior. I'd love to see if anyone could do better than this desk at this price point.Pros:+ Very sturdy, even at highest setting+ Quiet movement--I've adjusted during conference calls with no disruption to the call+ One solid piece desktop--no seams+ Size: I have the 55\" X 28\" I have two 24\" monitors and my laptop as third display. Plenty of room for all of those side by side, an ergonomic keyboard, a lamp, two bookshelf speakers, a label printer and plenty of work space still.+Size, Part Deux: I have a 20\" wide portable set of drawers I put under it. Fits great, plenty of room for my legs under it in the down/seated position.+ Slightly beveled edge--doesn't dig into wrists with sharp edge+ Easy to assemble. I don't know how one reviewer said it took him 2 days and 2 adults. The first one took me a 90 minutes, by myself. Second one about 45 minutes by myself.Cons: (really minimal, and petty)- Instructions were a little challenging at first, especially the connecting rod (one motor, turns a rod that connects to both legs so both legs adjust with gears) and the cross brace. Once you figure out that the hardware (legs/braces/motor) kit is designed to work with desktops of multiple widths, and that you just extend the connecting rod and cross brace to the width of this desk, it's easy.- No pre-drilled second hole for the control panel. You screw in the front into a pre-drilled hole, but then have to drill your own pilot for the second screw. If you don't put the second screw in, the controller will spin. Took 9 seconds to drill the hole + 90 seconds to get drill and bit from garage.- Surface had an ever so slight texture (while laminated version). No problems for me when writing--I don't even notice. If I was doing very precise drawing/drafting work, it might need a smooth topper.Buy it. Stop reading reviews or researching. This is the one. And I am not receiving any kind of incentive for this review. I am likely to get a third one for our youngest son.",

I really like that the surface is large and one solid piece. I didn't want gaps on my work surface. The electric mechanism to raise and lower the table works perfectly and is super quiet. The instructions aren't bad, but you do have to really look at the pictures to be sure you're putting things in the right places. I am a 56 year old female, and I was able to put this together by myself. I'd guess it took 1, maybe 2 hours to complete.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Overall product is good as expected and value for money. Mine is 48x 30 inches with casters. One desk came in 2 shipments (one for the top another one for the frame) without sharing separate tracking number so I just connected to customer service to reconfirm. As I ordered casters, so 3 packages in total for me. Instruction menu provided in both handbook and qr code to view vdo insturction. However, the instruction should be revised to be more precise a bit such as how long you should extend the cord before connect to the board. Also, the holes for button pad at the board are not 100% matching the instruction and not matching 2 holes in vertical side of the pad so I drilled only one as provided. I tried drilling another hole without pre-drill hole from the manufacturer but it did not work.",

I've used a small handful of standing desks, including a Herman Miller from my office, and I can confidently say this is a great option for an equivalent for the home.Assembling the desk required a bit of work, particularly as the leg and base is astonishingly heavy, however, I managed in just around two and a half hours. There are videos online which are super helpful, but aside from the weight of the materials, the assembly is no more difficult than a typical IKEA furniture.Super sturdy and stable, not much more to ask for. I feel as though this is the best bang for your buck standing desk out there. Super happy.Side note: I did not notice any unevenness, I suspect the couple of reviews that state this is because they accidentally turned on of the transmission rod when it was inserted on to only one of the legs during assembly--I for sure did. To remedy this, simply turn the transmission rod counter clockwise for both legs (to achieve the shortest maximum length) then re-insert the rod.",

I received maple top instead of the white as ordered but was offered the choice of either a small refund for incorrect top of returning/getting new one. Opted for refund just because it's easier and quicker. Maple top still looks lovely and the size is perfect for an at-home office. If you're not elevating your monitor/laptop with arms then you probably would want a bigger size than my 120x60 but for me, without those on the desktop taking up space, it's perfect.
