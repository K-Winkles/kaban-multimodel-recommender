                "reviewText": "This is great desk for the price, considering it was less than $100 for a 55 inch desk. It was easy to assemble though there are a lot of wood screws, so be prepared for a few hours of grafting to screw everything together, but otherwise, the directions were decent and it is all fairly self-explanatory to put together. Desk looks good and it's nice that it comes with a cup holder and headphones hook, as well as cable snatches and cable ring hiders in the desk. It also came with a bunch of screws that were not needed, so don't stress, when you have leftover pieces - my desk has not fallen apart yet! My only complaint is the desk control panel for raising/lowering is really cheap and I feel like it may break in a few months. It's pretty crappy, but the desk raises up and lowers fine without any real noise, so hopefully it will last. I am not sure paying $400 would have got me much more, so overall this is a sound purchase.",

I may need a stool or just use it as a standing desk only. There was also a defect/damage on a bracket, which seems fine. The table itself is split into two pieces and joined together which is so so. If I would have spent more I would have expected more. The motor itself seems fine and works smoothly.",
