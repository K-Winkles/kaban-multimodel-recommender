Also, uses the extra space underneath to hold the processer with lots of room for my feet and legs. My son had no trouble putting it together alone. I am handicapped, so only good at advising! I admit I was hesitating about spending the cost, but as soon as he put the unit in place, I felt like I had won the lottery! . I ever so recommend this if you have some of my issues. First, the space that the size will fit in, because to can't grow, or shrink! I love my desk, and may be naming her Lassie, cause she is just a perfect companion for my needs. :).",

The part where you are connecting the board to the sides could have used 2 people but I managed. As you can see in my picture all parts were numbered and a screw driver was even enclosed. Instructions were in the box and they were pretty easy to follow. I haven\u2019t put together the computer stand alone unit because my computer is an all in one. I figured if I moved to the other side of my living room I could put my WiFi box on it. The reason for only 4 stars is because of the standard particle wood of course.",

                "reviewText": "It is a decent, sturdy, functional desk that is great for people working with limited space. There is only one problem: The metal rails that connect the keyboard platform to the rest of the desk are sharp and I've scraped my arms on it a few times already, and I've only had the desk for a few months at the time of review.On another important matter, My desk did not come with the instructions. I tried multiple times to reach out to the seller and even the manufacturer with no response. It seemed like all the parts were present though, so with help from other family members, we were able to figure it out and assemble the desk. Because of this, I cannot attest to the entirety of the craftsmanship because it's possible we did not install parts correctly. I mention this to forewarn others that - if someone is wrong with your order - it is very likely you will have no choice but to live with it, or more likely, return it.",
