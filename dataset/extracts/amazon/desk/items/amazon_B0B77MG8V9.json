                "reviewText": "I was initially hesitant about buying a standing desk, especially one made of manufactured wood, given the concerns about durability and sturdiness. But boy, was I in for a surprise! This adjustable standing desk not only exceeded my expectations but also proved that you don't always have to break the bank for quality.Right out of the box, the craftsmanship was evident. The finish was sleek, giving it a classy look that could easily blend with any office or home decor. As for the adjustability, it was smooth and efficient, ensuring that I could find the perfect height for my work comfort.The most significant win for me was its stability. Despite its affordable price tag, this desk held its ground, quite literally. It didn't wobble, even when burdened with my dual monitor setup and a plethora of other office supplies. This stability was a testament to its well-thought-out design and robust construction.Looking back, I'm thrilled I took the leap of faith with this purchase. I was close to spending thrice as much on another model, and I genuinely believe this desk offers the same, if not better, value for a fraction of the price.In conclusion, if you're on the fence about getting this adjustable standing desk, I'd say go for it. It's a blend of style, functionality, and affordability that's hard to come by these days.",

                "reviewText": "The desk top comes in 3 pieces, but there appears to be enough metal support on the underside, the desk appears sturdy. It was a bit cumbersome to put together and you'll definitely need a second person to flip it over when complete. I haven't had any issues with it raising or lowering, it is sitting on carpet. You'll want to get some 3M adhesive tape to mount the power supply. The adhesive they send is not sufficient and the power supply will fall off the underside of the desk or even off the side of the table leg. The control is simple to use, however if you lose power the clock will reset, but not the date. Additionally, the temperature reading will be off by at least 10 degrees. When I first contacted the company, they told me it didn't have a temperature display until I sent proof. After that they said it was due to the sensitivity of the sensor and from the heat the control was making inside the shell. Total hogwash, but they offered me a return of a paltry sum to forget about it, which I will after this review. Over all it appears to be a decent desk, I got mine with a $100 off coupon. It would be nice if it had one motor per leg (3), but so far two seems to work fine. It also holds a dual monitor mount without any issues. Overall, it seems to be a decent desk.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a modern, clean, and ergonomic desk to use since I work remotely from home. I noticed around mid day I\u2019d get lower back pain from sitting, and started thinking it would be nice to have the option to stand. I bought this desk, and it is perfect for my needs and wants. It\u2019s large enough for my two large computer monitors, printer, router, modem, and hard drive. It raises and lowers to your specifications with one touch of a button. It\u2019s easy to put together. It\u2019s sturdy. I love the way it looks and functions. Best part, no more back pain!",

Haha.Adjusting the desk is so exciting & easy and I love that its a wide table top. At least it\u2019s wider than my previous desk and enough room to have my 2 computer monitors for work an Alexa and my binder on the left side and my lap top and desk organizer on the right side. Husband is thinking about getting one for his office now.",

The controller that raises your desk, also displays the date, time and temperature in the room. The desk is quiet when you are raising it. I have only had the desk a month or so, and as I stated, I love it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really like this desk after assembling it\u2026but assembling was a huge pain! I was mostly taken aback by the amount of holes I had to drill in myself that were NOT pre-drilled. The instructions say you can use either a screwdriver or a drill, but I don\u2019t know in what world drilling 15 new holes could be done with a screwdriver.Assembly is pretty good up until the step where you secure the frame/legs to the desk. There are 8 pre-drilled holes, but the other 15 holes have to be made yourself.It was also missing a part labeled G. According to the manual, G screws were only 1mm shorter than the A screws, which there were plenty of, so I just used A instead of G. I\u2019m glad it worked, but I would\u2019ve preferred to assemble it as intended.There were also many parts that were not labeled. I\u2019m not sure why some parts were labeled and some were not, it seemed kind of random. Definitely use the assembly manual and pay attention to detail with what parts have which unique features and which way they\u2019re oriented in order to use the correct parts.Overall I do like the desk a lot and I think it was worth the hassle, but there are things you need to know before buying that are not made clear.",
