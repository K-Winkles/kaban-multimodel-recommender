Since we already had everything laid out in order.....I just decided.....why not. Husband was at work, I turned the tv on and just started one page at a time. I said, well.....I will leave the big parts for him.....lol it was done before he got home. So yes, it was easy and probably took about an hour or so. I didn't keep track of time....just did it without rushing to make sure it was done correctly. I am please with it. It looks great in my craftroom!!!",

So now I'm without a desk until I can find a suitable replacement. Steer clear",

We tried to watch the video from the QR code but it would just take us to the Amazon page where it had no additional information. Ended up doing some improvising and got it hooked together. Tried following the directions that came with it but a video definitely would have helped. Overall 3/5 because building it was a pain.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The desk is large and sturdy, with an excellent appearance and texture. It arrived in perfect condition, with no shipping damage. My initial reservations about the drawers (being that they\u2019d be flimsy and break) were eased by their thick fabric and sturdy metal frames, which gave them the appearance of real wood. Each drawer's front is likewise quite sturdy. This desk is a good investment when considering the price, especially when bought on sale. The integrated lights are a nice touch. The desk's construction is incredibly stable; even when loaded heavily, it does not bow or wobble. The desk took less than an hour to put together by myself so I\u2019d say almost anyone could put it together. You\u2019d probably prefer to do it with two people though. It also came with easily accessible screws that took seconds to tighten (especially with an additional tool). In a nutshell it has the same solidity as a more expensive, all-wood desk. I'm so impressed that I'd gladly order another!! 10/10",
