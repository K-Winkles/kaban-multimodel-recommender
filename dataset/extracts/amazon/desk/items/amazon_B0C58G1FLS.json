Easy to do by one person and all tools needed are provided even with spares of each screw, dowel etc.Well packaged and quite sturdy once assembled. Light enough to move around the room easily by one person as well.Shelf for monitors is only 6 inches wide so not great if your monitors have stands like mine(pictured)also if you tighten the screws too much they can pierce through the other side of the wood (pictured) so once you feel resistance, stop...The \"carbon fibre\" look is actually quite nice and the LED lights and small power bar give it a bit of a neat factor.In general a great purchase for the price for an entry level desk",
