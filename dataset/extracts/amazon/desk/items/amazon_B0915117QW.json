High value for the price, and I've been sorely tempted to buy two.Highly quality appearance. I got walnut.It definitely was a two person job. Took over a half hour.We got the legs backwards at one point and were so relieved to be done by the end, we didn't both correcting that we installed one of the hooks upside down.Easy instructions. So much so that a ten-year old child helped me build it. :)Holds my HP touchscreen computer, though weighty, well. As you can see, I can fit a whole lot on it. Very sturdy for the job.Chic in appearance and great for organizing office supplies!All glory, praise, thanks, and all things be to God on the highest forever and ever in Jesus mighty and wonderful name. He's coming soon. He loves you. Believe this and repent. Join him.",

                "reviewText": "I have been work from home for about 3 years now (since Covid) and we aren\u2019t going back to office. Been using what was essentially a glorified book shelf for a desk.I recently got a printer, and I had nowhere to keep it, so I had to make the plunge and invest in a larger workspace. I did not want to spend a fortune, and this desk is honestly way better than I could have anticipated. The \u201cwood grain\u201d effect is very attractive, and makes it look classy and professional. Assembly was incredibly easy, and I set it up on my own in just a few hours. Probably would have been less if not for my ADD \ud83d\udc40Fits great in my room, and it is so nice having the extra space- not only for my printer and work- but also room for other activities like writing, drawing, etc during downtime. I love having the elevated shelf for my monitor, and I am grateful that the placement was customizable. If the monitor shelf *had* to be on the other side (as pictured in the listing) it would have blocked my bed, and would not have worked for me (my office space is in my bedroom). It seems perfectly sturdy and I love that there is plenty of space underneath. My only critique would be that the drawer is essentially unusable due to how small the sections are. That being said, they are easily removed and I don\u2019t see any reason why I can\u2019t just take them out if I choose to use it.This is a fantastic desk, for a great price and I am very happy with my purchase. My daughter is jealous and wants one for her gaming station, so I may be getting another one in the future. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Great Value for the Price!I recently purchased this $100 desk, and I must say, I am pleasantly surprised by its quality and functionality. For the price, it's a fantastic deal! Here's my take on the desk:Pros:1. Sturdy Construction: The desk feels quite robust and stable. I was worried that it might wobble, but it holds up well, even when I'm typing vigorously or placing heavier items on it.2. Easy Assembly: Putting this desk together was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and all the necessary tools were included. I managed to assemble it on my own within an hour.3. Spacious Surface: The desk provides ample space for my laptop, monitor, keyboard, and additional accessories. I can even spread out my paperwork comfortably.4. Aesthetic Design: I appreciate the simple and clean design of the desk. It fits well with my existing furniture and doesn't take up too much space in my small office area.Cons:1. Minor Scratches: When the desk arrived, I noticed a couple of small scratches on the surface. While they don't affect the functionality, it would have been nice to have a flawless surface.2. Limited Storage: The desk doesn't have drawers or shelves, so if you require extra storage, you might need to invest in a separate filing cabinet or organizer.Overall, this $100 desk is an excellent purchase. It serves its purpose well and meets my expectations. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option that still offers quality and functionality, I highly recommend considering this desk. Just be mindful of the possibility of minor imperfections upon arrival. Despite the minor cons, it has been a valuable addition to my home office setup.",

I would suggest getting help to move it to your desired location since dragging it across the floor could cause the rubber studs at the bottom to pop out. The studs are easy to put back in, but I would still advise against dragging. Now that the desk is up, I can get started on decorating my little office corner.",

I used a drill bit to clear those and continue the assembly.It is definitely strong enough to hold the computer and books that I will be putting on it. Because it is mostly metal, it jiggles more than other desks that I have owned, but I am just fine with that.I would recommend this desk for a corner computer workstation/handwriting station in a small home office.",
