It has the bottom shelf for a printer or storage. I absolutely love it. If you want a small, sturdy inexpensive desk. This is it.",

At the time I was sharing a house with many people so my wfh job required me to be outside of the home in order to reduce background noise. And because I live in a high humidity climate I hate to report that the growth of mildew was pretty expensive on the back untreated sides of this desk It required regular maintenance and wiping to keep it cleared but eventually the wood did finally swell and split. But this was to be expected giving the harsh conditions I subjected it to. Overall super happy and if the need was there I would buy this again without hesitation",

I would recommend having wood glue on hand as a back up as well to make sure the legs of the desk are sturdy. It's definitely good and cute for the price!",

It fits in the small space I needed it for, and it holds my laptop (just barely).But, if you consider that I purchased a new desk, the way that it arrived was disappointing. Almost every piece of this desk had minor scuffs or imperfections in the wood. Many of the pieces were missing the letter labels, making building it take longer than it should've. The instructions are in broken English in parts, and some steps were confusing, causing me to put some pieces of this desk together upside down.Overall, it works for a temporary desk, but it is certainly not sturdy or pretty to look at.On the bright side, the \"java\" color I ordered actually came more black, which is what I originally wanted.",

                "reviewText": "The quality is amazing, during the assembly it may feel a little wobbly and not great, but when all out together it looks so lovely and cozy, so sturdy (within the correct weight range). The weight is not too bad, it\u2019s what you would expect for a desk, but the size is perfect, the back extra part does not need to be put on if extra flat space is needed, but even with it added, there is so much space. Can fit an a4 piece of paper length ways between the end of the desk to the bump out for the extra compartments. The footrest, under part is an amazing added touch, although sometimes feel like it is a little less sturdy, so maybe put something under it although there is a beam under it. The labelling for the parts to assemble is decent, in some areas the instructions are hard to understand, but with a little common sense you can easily assemble it. The screws are a little fiddly though. For \u00a357 (or \u00a334 if on sale) it is defo worth it, a must buy. The colour is beautiful, size is amazing, so spacious, and such a perfect added touch to any room!",
