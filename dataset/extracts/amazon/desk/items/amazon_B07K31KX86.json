The instructions were very simple and made putting it together quick an easy. It does require two people to put this together. It is very sturdy and has no wobble to it. The shelves are a good size and very sturdy as they are holding all of my nursing text books with no problem. :D 5 stars for size, color and sturdiness,The ONLY issue I have is that the main board that sits on top is cracked. It was like that when I opened the box. There are also several spots where there are dents and chips. Which is common and expected with this material. Although I love this desk, I do not however think it is worth what I paid which was $180 just because of the material. 3 stars for price and flaws.",

                "reviewText": "Ok. So first of all let me say I am basically a pro at assembling anything. Everyone calls me for help in these kinds of situations. With that said, let start with the packaging. This box was literally filled with broken styrofoam pieces. All I could do was chuckle at how insane it was. Think of your kid taking a styrofoam pieces and crumbling it into pieces, leaving some larger pieces and just and entire mess to clean up. Yeah, that\u2019s what it was stuffed with. HUGE MESS! Whatever, I got passed that and just figured I\u2019d be finding random styrofoam around the house for the next year. No biggie. Then comes assembly. The instructions are very clear, no problem. This was going to be an easy assembly. Boy was I wrong. The holes do not match up to the other parts holes correctly. The screws literally just fell out of desk as I was working on another part of it. When they did match up to the holes on one side, the other side didn\u2019t, which ended up making the screws completely rip out of the top (decorative) part. When I thought the nightmare was over and I go to flip it over, tons more screws came out again and the \u2018L\u2019 part of the desk was slightly crooked \ud83d\ude02. I can\u2019t help but laugh hysterically at how awful this product is. I now have to go get screws that will actually fit into it and not fall out, and try to jimmy the L of it and make it stay in place with add on holes I\u2019ll have to screw in. And hopefully that will work. Who knows if this thing will actually hold anything on it \ud83d\ude02. Very disappointed. I\u2019m a single mom with a low paying job which I\u2019m working on building up, which is why I needed the desk in the first place and it took me a year to save up enough to get even this one. I\u2019m desperate at this point so I\u2019m hoping it will at least hold my computer on it and get me by for now.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve seen mixed reviews as well as people complaining so I figured to jump in on the discussion. For the price it cost I am completely satisfied with this desk. The size is perfect to fit in a small space and has good amount of desk, and shelf space to get the job done. Some of the screw holes didn\u2019t line up so it forced me to improvise on the assembly. Other than that everything came very well packaged, no messy styrofoam, or chips in the wood. It\u2019s a bit thin and wobbles a bit, but definitely will get the job done and is worth the price. If your looking for a long term desk or something for multiple monitors I wouldn\u2019t suggest this one, but if your a student or looking for good workspace to get things done then this is well worth it. I can see myself eventually reinforcing the wood and screws, but you get what you pay for. It gives a nice smooth look to the room and nice space to work on a computer and use a notebook at the same time.",
