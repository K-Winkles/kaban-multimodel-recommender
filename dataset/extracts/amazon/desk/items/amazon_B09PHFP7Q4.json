                "reviewText": "Overall I am pretty happy with the desk.The final result, for me, is a overall very sharp-looking, spacious, useful, modern-looking desk. A tiny portion of the intended functionality is compromised because the space I had for it mandated reversing the design, which it is not designed to do. The build quality is low, but this is only really obvious while you are assembling it; the final product looks as nice as much, much more expensive desks. For the price I think this is easily worth it, but keep in mind you are sacrificing ease of assembly for the low cost and elegant look.The desk is not meant to be reversible, and if you do want to reverse it you have to make a few sacrifices. For one, the lower shelving unit's backplate is designed to friction-fit into pre-cut guide trenches that exist only on one side; I simply neglected to attach the backplate, but you might be able to screw it onto the other side. The same is true for the shelving unit's cabinet door. Reversing the actual desk part is fairly simple; you attach the two long bars to the top desk pieces as usual, but put the feet and the shelf attachments on at the opposite ends of the instructions.Of note, it does not ship with the tools you need to assemble it; you will need a basic phillips-head screwdriver, ideally with a replaceable bit and a handful of bit sizes. It does arrive, strangely, with a flathead screwdriver, but does not have any flathead screws. It also arrived with a single hex wrench that was properly sized for the hex screws it uses.It is very cheap for what it is. That helps a lot with satisfaction; if this were a $3k desk it would absolutely not be worth it. The cheapness also shows in the desk's build quality. The holes drilled into the bottom of the attached shelving unit, for example, were not placed in the correct locations and did not fit the legs; I had to make my own holes for them to attach properly. Tolerances on a lot of the other pieces were extremely varied; pilot holes were generally more aspirational than useful. The dark gray finish shows fingerprints like crazy, but fingerprints aren't visible on the wood-finished parts at all.The shelving unit has a surprising amount of capacity. Some of it relatively inaccessible, though, because it is placed directly beneath the far corner of the desk and hard to reach. As long as you keep stuff you only rarely need in that portion, though, it's a lot of quite useful space.The support bars below the main desk are mildly annoying, my legs do bump into/brush them frequently. If you are able to sit with your seat a fair bit below the desk, though, this is less likely to be an issue.Overall, 8/10 for me. Pretty pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start with the cons. Some of the items were mislabeled, the instructions are very \"feel your way through it\", and a piece was damaged. With that being said, I love this desk. The instructions aren't the clearest but are manageable. When putting it together, a lot of the pieces are universal so you can flip it around and still get to the end piece. The only time I put something together that was wrong is before you put the table top on (attached the picture of how it should be so you don't do it wrong like I did, stress about it not fitting, and loose 30-45 mins of your time). The damaged piece (pictured) was just bent and fortunately did not interfere with the process at all. I only planned to reach out to the manufacturer if it stopped me from putting the desk together but it all worked out.One of the things I love the most is desk and the cabinet are 2 separate pieces. If you move or something along those lines, you can essentially lift the table off the cabinet portion and transport them individually. Extremely impressed with this desk and happy with the purchase!",

The desk came with scratches, rust, misplaced screwholes and the styrofoam that was meant to protect the item was very poor standard and falling apart once package was opened. After complaining to company it is clear they are an Amazon reseller with no responsibility over item and no interest in providing customer service. I have asked to have item returned and they kept trying to ask to exchange different pieces of desk or \u201c$30\u201d in compensation with no change to item as if it would resolve issue. They have become non-responsive now. I deeply regret purchasing this product, and would urge anyone else considering purchasing a product with this company to avoid at all costs. The images and price point are appealing, but it is a false representation of the company and the product.",
