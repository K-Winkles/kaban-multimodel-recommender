However, once everything was assembled correctly, everything worked out fine. The one issue I do have is the cup holder attachment. It was slightly bent one way, so when I tried to bend it back, the metal snapped off completely, disengaging the holder from the desk. While I didn't get the desk for the cup holder aspect, it would have been nice. In the end, the in-desk outlets are great; they are true to their size and easy to assemble.",

Came across this corner unit and he loves it. My son said a little difficulty in putting it together but is working out nicely. Sturdy, nice quality and now he has more room for his \u201cstuff\u201d!! Happy camper.",

I looked at similar style desks, and was more impressed with this particular one for the apparently more sturdy construction and a few features, such as the built-in power strip along the top of the desktop. The desk arrived as promised. Grandson was very excited with the desk, and put it together immediately after all the presents were opened. He's happy with the desk. I was happy with the quality of the desk and the price. The company has also impressed me with their followup to assure my satisfaction with the purchase.",
