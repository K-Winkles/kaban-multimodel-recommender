                "reviewText": "I'm happy to report that my pieces arrived in very good condition--there were minor cosmetic flaws, but no cracks or dents that would make me question the integrity of the desk. I was a little concerned about the state of the drawer rails, as they're slightly bent (see attached picture), but upon closer inspection I realized that's how they're meant to be and I can confirm that they work perfectly well.The assembly process went smoothly; it took an hour, maybe an hour and a half from start to finish. You'll definitely need a hammer, and I would recommend using a screwdriver other than the one that comes with the desk; it felt flimsy and seemed much worse at actually screwing things in. I completed the assembly without power tools without much difficulty, but I could see where a drill would make things easier. I did it on my own, and none of the parts were too heavy to maneuver; the most difficult part was attaching the desktop and hutch to the bottom which might take a second pair of hands.The instructions were clear, for the most part; the pictures did a good job showing where everything went. However, there were some parts of the manual which were incorrect, such as the counts for how much of each part or which connector you're to use. To my knowledge, though, the pictures were accurate, and I deferred to them when I ran into an issue with the instructions (and I wound up with a solid desk from it).As for the parts: everything is clearly labeled, mostly. Some of the stickers indicating the part number came partially scratched off, but it wasn't too hard to figure out what was what--again, the pictures were a great guide. (Later on, as it turned out, the stickers became a bit of a pain--they're hard to get off completely without any residue.) The various screws and connectors came helpfully separated, although it's worthwhile to double check the counts when you get the desk--I didn't have any issues with having too /few/ screws, but I /did/ have too many by the end of the build. I assume if they can miscount in one direction they can miscount in the other. There is a separate bag containing spare parts, but it doesn't hurt to be careful!Once everything was all set up, I was very pleased with how the desk came out. The drawer and keyboard tray work smoothly, and there's a good amount of desk space on top. The shelf they provided for the side cabinet is a little unstable, though, so I would be careful about putting too much weight or something fragile on it. All told, it's a great, compact workspace--perfect for a small apartment or dorm.",

I bought it 4 years ago for around $80 (much cheaper than it is now) and it has absolutely punched above its price point and held up fantastically. Easy to assemble and very sturdy. It's been through 2 moves and I have no issues with it. Even at the current pricing (~$150), I'd still buy it. If you're on the fence about it, go ahead and buy it! You won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased a lot of inexpensive, self assemble furniture products. This is the first one where I\u2019ve encountered an issue. On the left side panel, the holes for the bolts are not properly aligned with the cam holes on the back support panel. The top of the support panel is not flush with the top of the side panel and protrudes 3/8\u201d. Therefore the desktop will not be able to be attached properly. The online support web address provided takes me to \u2018page not found\u2019 so I used the customer service email address included with the product (since a phone number for customer service was not provided). Received an automated response that the office is closed (today is Saturday 3/30) and that they will respond on the next business day. Needless to say I am quite disappointed. If the company does not send replacement parts that fit properly, I will be returning this product.Update: Wednesday (4/3) I Received a response from customer service stating they have ordered a replacement part to be shipped to me. In 3-5 days I should find whether or not this new piece fits properly.Final update: Friday (4/5) the replacement part was awaiting me when I arrived home. The part fit perfectly and the remaining assembly went quickly and smoothly.Updated my rating to four stars. It is a great desk for the price and is easy to assemble. The company was great with solving the one issue I did have and did it promptly. The only reason I\u2019m withholding one star is because it would have been preferable to have had all the parts in the original delivery manufactured correctly and not had a delay in finishing the assembly.",

                "reviewText": "The desk actually arrived with a missing piece, but after I emailed customer service, they mailed the missing piece out promptly and I received it in just a little over a week of emailing them. I was actually not expecting to receive anything as some of these reviews have stated, but was surprised to see the box with the missing piece on my doorstep today. The desk was still functional without the missing piece (it was the drawer bottom that was missing), but I\u2019m even more happy with my purchase now that it\u2019s complete and with the customer service, (even though I never \u201cheard\u201d back from them as their reply to my email went into my junk mail box so I didn\u2019t realize anyone had actually responded back to me about my missing piece until the box arrived today.)The desk is the perfect size for my elementary aged child and would still be a good fit through high school, if the quality lasts that long. The drawer is a little on the small side, but again, descent for her needs.I really liked that the desk came with all the necessary screws and tools. All parts were labeled well and instructions were clear. I was able to put it together by myself (and I AM NOT HANDY). Took me a couple hours, but I also have 3 young children with me at all times so I kept having to take \u201cbreaks\u201d from building.I think this is a descent quality desk at this price for school aged children. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to purchase another one. Just hopefully it\u2019ll give us a few years worth of doing homework on.",
