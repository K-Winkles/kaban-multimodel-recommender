                "reviewText": "I always worked out of the home before the pandemic and got by with a cramped, oddly designed desk left by a previous tenant. It was fine for the few hours a week I used it, but after months working from home I decided to make the jump and set up a working office space. I spent a full day sifting through options and hesitated over this because there are few reviews. I've only just started working on it, but I'm glad I picked this.I wanted a lot of space but wasn't sure I was ready to commit to an L desk, since it limited my placement options. However, it fits perfectly in the corner and it's a bonus that the second arm can be taken off and folded up basically no problem.First off, it took less than fifteen minutes to unpack and assemble. I don't mind putting things together, but if you hate assembly projects, don't have any help, or usually need a hand putting together furniture, this is very easy for one non-technical person to do in just a couple of minutes.Both parts are foldable, which I was ambivalent about, but it does make moving it around easier. It snapped open right away and feels totally sturdy, and screwing the second part on was easy. It's spacious, light in color (which is nice for my dark room), and has plenty of leg room. It looks exactly like in the picture. Came well packed and doesn't wobble at all.I saw some comments about it arriving covered in fiber glass, so I had a wet rag handy. I did find a couple of pieces but I probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't read ahead, and it was no problem. The corners are pretty sharp but I prefer the look that way and don't have major concerns with placement, or desk-height kids/pets/etc. As shown, it doesn't come with pre-set holes for cords, but I prefer that and it's easy to position just an inch off the wall (doesn't need to lean on anything to feel stable). I didn't need to tighten anything, and the box arrived with a couple small dings but nothing impacting the desk, which was very well packed (in styrofoam).As long as it holds up, I'm psyched! This seems like it will last just fine, it seems like the finish might be the first thing to go (and if that's all, that's fine as long as it takes a while). If easy assembly is a priority, or you move around a lot and a folding desk is good, definitely consider this. It's just as advertised and a perfectly decent desk, per the other reviews! My cats also love it because there's plenty of room and I don't have to shoo them away to keep them from knocking things over. Glad I bought it!",

Only 3 screws (honestly, I only used 2, bec I didn't see where a 3rd would go, and I didn't read the instructions, but it's really sturdy). I love that the legs simply fold. I bought monitor risers and a little organizing shelf, and my old desk just wasn't wide enough for it all. I found my keyboard was right on the edge, and it wasn't ergonomic, so I bought this one because it's wider but not really expensive. It works great for all my stuff, and I'm much more comfortable working from home now.",

There were two very small insignificant (to me) stains on the surface of the desk top. (See photo) They may come out with time and cleaning. Just wanted to give folks a heads up about something. If you have carpet, small children or pets be very careful when unboxing. On the surface of the desktop, there was a solid, light coating of what appears to be fiber glass shards, or overspray from factory sealants. It easily wipes off, but it was all over my shirt front from unboxing and assembly. I was glad my dogs were outside and my son wasn\u2019t over curious before I got cleaned up and wiped the desk down and vacuumed. Overall, very pleased, just thought I would give a friendly \u2018heads up\u2019 \ud83d\ude0a",
