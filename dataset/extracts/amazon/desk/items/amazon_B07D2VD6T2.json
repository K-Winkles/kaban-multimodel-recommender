                "reviewText": "Starting a new job and needed a home office set up. Furniture stores have a very long wait time. Lots of option for quick furniture. However, chose this as solid wood. The color is great just as picture. These desk is a nice long size and plenty of room after putting on my two monitor stands. Set up was pretty easy, remove desk drawers, add legs, and drawer pulls. Set is heavy so had family help me hold up the desk while assembling. The drawers did not have screw holes so used my drive to assemble that part. (It did have the new furniture smell others spoke of. I unpacked and let air out a day before assembling). Love the flip down option of the middle drawer to turn into a keyboard holder. You open the drawer and click on the releast button, so easy. The two other drawers are about the size of a pack of paper. I paired this with the Harper Cube bookcase as no Hollander one available; which is very similiar in color and am very happy with the results. There are imperfections in paint, etc. However, good enough for me, so if a perfectionist may be an issue. The wood is solid wook and heavy, but also soft and subject to dings. Overall, I would purchase again for my quick need for office furniture. It is not a $2,000 furniture store quality desk, but a great compromise from pressboard throw away furniture which is also available quickly.",

                "reviewText": "Update: after near 1month of use, I am downgrading it from 2 star to 1. The surface has already dented, the super thin veneer layer is already pealed off in some places. And the desk is moving due its extreme low weight. I am not writing emotional binary 5 or 1 start reviews. But for this desk If we had zero star, I would chose it.2 star because of the legs and ease of assembly, otherwise it would be a 1 star.The table top is made of very lightweight super soft (low density) wood perhaps White Pine or Basswood. It has very low quality super thin finish. These make the desk package very prone to dents and scratches with slight touch of objects that do not bother your ordinary desks. It is less than a week, and my desk already got multiple dents and scratches from normal home office use.In addition, the desk is super lightweight and it wants to move with every small force. I have to screw it to the wall to avoid movement (my old desk was not similar).Oh, because of the desktop soft material, it feels hollow under your hand. For example, when my hands are on the desk and if my neighbor pull out his truck out of the garage, my hands sense the waves of vibration!!! Also, when you type on your keyboard at night, the hollow-like vibrating tabletop resonances the noise of the key strokes making the whole experience annoying (things that makes wife complaining why are you working at late night!)I am totally unsatisfied and if I could I would return the desk and buy one from Costco. Unfortunately I threw away the cardboard package and cannot return an assembled desk.Generally, I learned it is not a good idea to buy unknown wooden furniture online without experiencing the feel and workmanship.",
