BOTH are In fantastic shape one I\u2019ve had for over a year and the second I just got, more than likely will be buying a third soon. The wood on this piece is BEAUTIFUL \u2728 very sturdy, I have my PC on my desk in the other setup (that\u2019s how much I trust this) the standing feature is amazing. I know people who have spent $1500+ on a worse desk and this one was $98 when I got mine. 1000000% worth the purchase!!!! BUY IT!!",

                "reviewText": "I mean, I don't even know where to begin! The assembly instructions were incredibly vague, and the wimpiest little hexagonal wrench was all that was provided - even still, not that big of a deal. I push forward, assembling the pieces exactly as instructed, only to find that the two pieces for the top of the desk literally cannot fit onto the assembled stand without creating new drill holes, as they were not measured out properly. And yes, I tried every which way to ensure I was not, in fact, the idiot of the situation. No luck. Still, I forge ahead. Once everything is assembled and I test this baby out - I give that up button a whirl and hear the smooth automated sound of the gears working to raise the desk up, up....UP! It had a three second delay after releasing the button that caused it to nearly wedge itself under my windowsill. ZERO safety features for this thing, which would be fine if the machine actually stopped when you let off the button. Alas. When I decided to return it, I was offered either a partial refund without returning it, or a full refund with return. I chose the full refund option, but was unable to find a box that could actually fit the pieces to return (the original box was made of such weak cardboard that it was beyond reuse), and reached out to a representative to get the previously offered partial refund. However, because I cancelled my return before reaching out to support and the date for my return window had passed, it was now magically no one's problem. So no customer support, no functional desk, and not even a partial refund to show for it. Ew.",

The work surface is fairly thin, but is fine for a desk.Now the bad. The installation is a pain. The quality control clearly does not review the end product. Almost all of the screw holes were not in the right place. This meant that there was a large gap between the two panels. It also meant that securing the top to the legs required new holes to be drilled. If you raise the desk to a standing height, it is not the most stable with some wiggling. The desk is priced low, but that is most likely due to the items I mentioned. Not recommended.",
