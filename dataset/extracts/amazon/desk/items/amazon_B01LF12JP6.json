                "reviewText": "This might be the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon, and I truly regret it. Unfortunately the desks at IKEA that I wanted are all out of stock, so I had to resort to this DISASTER. Where to begin. Straight out of the box, nearly EVERY surface has something wrong with it, and not a single one is due to shipping. The top (main desk area) has two large black streaks, and two divots in the finish (again not from shipping). Every single leg has nicks in the edges, excess/messy paint or something else wrong. The inside of the drawers are covered in black splotches, I'm assuming dirty finger prints? The edges of this desk are extremely sharp, so not only dangerous to be around, but even having your arms lean on it like you normally would to type or work is extremely uncomfortable. After less than one day of use, my arms are already irritated and have lines in them constantly when I use. Just so you are aware, since there is no mention of it, this desk is has a TEXTURED surface. The 'white finish' must be very thin because any amount of liquid will cause it to get a dark spot, and in just a few hours of use, somehow I now have permanent oil spots on this desk even though there was no oil on it. Even as I type this out, I can physically see the desk wobbling just from me typing.Every finish and edge on this thing is just overall crap. I don't anticipate this will even last a month. If you think IKEA furniture is low quality, don't even attempt to buy this, as IKEA looks like a Rolls Royce next to this heap of junk.The ONLY thing this has going for it is that it is easy to put together.",

The desk surface will show exposure to even a tiny bit of moisture (it bubbled when I put a glsss with ice on it). The legs have slight curves to them, tightening and loosening didn\u2019t fix it. But it\u2019s still functional. Also the desk and a slight sag to it in the middle. I haven\u2019t put anything heavy on it (heaviest thing being my laptop) so not sure why it\u2019s bowing.And last thing: the drawers are tiny. They don\u2019t go the depth of the desk and are incredibly shallow. One drawer has a hairline crack in it already.So fine if you don\u2019t need perfect and you don\u2019t need to use a desk.",

Plus I have it in front of a window downstairs so I can see why they are barking. Top of desk big enough for two laptops plus writing tablet space. Wide enough for large desktop calendar to doodle on. Two small drawers big enough for office supplies and dog treats for distraction. Easy assembly as top with drawers was already put together. I only had to add the legs. Sturdy enough for desk use but lightweight. Not made for placing heaving items on top. Functional for my needs. Price was right. When I retire, I can move this into my grandson's room of too many toys. I really wanted a French Provincial writing desk with fancy legs, but have you seen the price of those things?",
