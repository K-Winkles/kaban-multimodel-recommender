The built in plugs and lights make it very comfy for gaming setups and such. The desktop also has a really good smooth surface that makes mouse pads unnecessary. I also have 2 fairly heavy monitors that have no problem mounting onto the top area of the desk. Very good GGs",

The instructions were clear to understand and all the parts were labeled, it also came with all the tools needed to assemble. It was very easy to put together. I think this was definitely a great deal and more than worth the price. For the price the quality really was better than I expected it to be. I am very pleased with my purchase.",

The top shelf holds a large monitor a laptop, hub, cellphone and a light (it is sized well). Desk surface space is fine, and the LED under lighting is nice. Desk seems sturdy enough, no issues with quality.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought other cheap, lightweight furniture on Amazon and the quality is usually pretty low, so that's what I expected from this desk. It is exceeding expectations so far. It was pretty easy to assemble. It took me about 90 minutes to do alone. Everything fit together precisely - it wasn't one of those experiences where you struggle to get the last screw in because the holes weren't perfectly drilled. There was one manufacturing error - one of the metal pieces to attach the monitor shelf didn't have a hole drilled in it. Since this was only one of six attachment points for the shelf, it is still plenty secure without that bolt. The only other issue is that the adhesive on the light strip is not sticking on the end with the cable.The fabric drawers are so much better than expected. I've had other furniture with these where you had to hold up the bottom of the drawer while pulling them out or they would fall. These move just like regular drawers, but even better because they don't have any stops that prevent you from pulling them all the way out. They feel very sturdy.I wanted a desk with more storage than this one, but couldn't find anything. I resolved this by buying one monitor stand with drawers to put under my printer on the desk and a smaller one to put on the shelf above the fabric drawers.",

Between my partner and I, we took about 45-60 minutes to assemble the desk. I must admit that I have only two primary complaints, and I recognize they are largely my fault for not reading the product description more closely.Firstly, the drawers are constructed with a lower quality fabric, which may not hold up as well over time. Secondly, the desk itself is slightly shallower than I expected. However, aside from these two issues, I'm genuinely satisfied with my purchase. It's a great value overall.",
