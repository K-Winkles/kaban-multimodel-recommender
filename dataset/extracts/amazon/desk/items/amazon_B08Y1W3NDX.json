                "reviewText": "Very impressed with this desk! It came about 4 days earlier than expected, and was packaged very well. It is very easy to put together, and came with all the necessary tools. I put it together myself by hand in about 15 or 20 minutes. It's really just something like 25 bigger size hex screws that you need to put in. Very basic and easy. It is light and easy to move, but is also very sturdy in place. I opted for the brown, and it's like a nice rich walnut finish. There is considerable black grain texture in it, so it is a little bit of a darker walnut rather than a pure brown walnut. The finish also feels and seems to be very durable. It seems like a nice thick laminate on the MDF. I would easily recommend this to a friend. Very good value.",
