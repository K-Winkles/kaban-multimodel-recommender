It works great for the purpose, but the only complains I have were the multiple issues with assembly and the dent in the main desktop piece.I have a 15in laptop that I use at this desk and have plenty of space if I wanted to add a monitor or 2. I usually use a Portable monitor and stand for my laptop, which is about the same size as the laptop screen, but a couple larger monitors would probably fit with no problem.Issues:-One of the desk feet did not screw into the pole at all, it would just fall out. We ended up putting a glue on the piece to tighten it and keep it from falling out.-The other issue we found was with one of the poles that held up the desk. We found that the piece you screw into inside the pole just falls out. We just made sure to be careful with this piece when putting it together.-Lastly, the longest wooden piece of the desk had a dent in the side the side of one of the screwheads. It's a bit annoying since it catches on fabrics, but I deal with it.",

                "reviewText": "First things first, there is a ton of reviews about missing peices, review what you have before starting to see if you need replacements.Second and very important, the instructions are wrong or missing information! If you follow the instructions you will damage the desk! On step 2 (refer to attached photo) it shows you need 8 C screws, but in the contents page it shows you only have 4, that's because you only need 4. For the screws going in at the bottom do not use C screws! Use A instead! A will not go through the board, and you'll notice you should have enough A screws for what is listed in the instruction AND this step.Third, the instructions do not refer to peice 6 at all except for in the contents page, don't forgot this peice, it goes between the feet to stabilize the desk. (Refer to photo for visual idea)Lastly, just for my review I'd like to thank the reviewer Regan who gave a 1 star review, as they had mentioned replacing the 4 C screws with A instead and it was perfect! My desk doesn't have damage and we aren't missing peices. There is a gap at the back of the desk, but I feel it's intentional to allow you to put your cords behind the desk without pinching them. That being said, there is a small gap between the 2 desk boards caused by the bracket that does annoy me a bit, but is purely esthetic. The desk is small, which is what I wanted and fits my 3 monitors just fine. It is exactly what I needed, just wasn't fun to solve the puzzles of the instructions. Overall I like the desk and size, it fits the space I have and does look nice, all things considered.",
