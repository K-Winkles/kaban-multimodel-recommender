                "reviewText": "Appearance: The product looks exactly as advertised and appears very modern in person. The quality is not lacking.The printer shelf is very sturdy. I would (and I'm just nit picking) add 8-10 inches on the L shape storage part if I could just to add that extra space.Ease of installation: This thing was very easy to put together even my 5 year old could find the parts as they were ALL labeled. The instructions were very detailed and clear. I will say I appreciate the shelves being partly fabric to save time and weight during installation. It can easily be disassembled and moved.Time: I took my time with this to make sure it was put together correctly. Took me about 3.5 hours solo with next to no difficulty.Lighting. The lighting assembly with 3m tape and wire holders was very very very easy. 3m rape stuck very well as did the wire holders. The remote is attached to the plug, and is easily plugged into the power strip attached to the desk. The lights are very noticeable even with the lights on as you can see in the pictures. Lots of vibrant colors. The lighting is not lacking on this product.Recommendation: I bought this for my wife to use as her home office. Some bought for gaming. I will say if you have wall mounted monitors it would work better than the shelf. The surface is pretty clean and slick. About 6 inches wide. I'd suggest a grippy pad for monitors even against the wall.Overall: I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants an upgraded and affordable home office or gaming desk. Its sturdy, customizable on the L shape from left or right, and looks great.",

                "reviewText": "This computer desk is definitely smaller in person than it looks in the pictures. For the price though I wasn't expecting much. The unit took me a solid 4 hours to assemble by myself, but the instructions are good enough. One of the leg pads broke due to over tightening, since it's only a cheap plastic cap over a bolt, but luckily this manufacturer provides extra hardware including an extra leg pad. I definitely appreciate that detail and I gave them an extra star in the \"easy to assemble\" category for that.The biggest negative I see here with the design as the cloth drawers. I really don't expect these things to last long at all, especially with cats in the house. Not to mention the fact that they attract cat hair like nothing I've ever seen before. Before I even had a chance to assemble and install them in the desk, they were already covered in cat hair. It'll be a nuisance trying to keep them clean for sure. I can see it might have been a small cost savings for the manufacturer to go with cloth drawers, but honestly engineered wood can't be much more expensive so they would have been better served if they went that route instead. I think most folks would be happier with the product overall if it had engineered wood drawers instead of cloth, even if it means having to pay an extra $10 for it.Aside from that I'll just say the depth of the desk surface is very short. You might not even have enough room on the surface of this desk for one large computer monitor and one full size keyboard. The even smaller top surface is so small that I wouldn't even feel comfortable putting a monitor of any size on it. It'd be too easy to fall down and break it. So that top surface is really only good for decorative items or small things like a can of pens/pencils, a small desk plant in a plastic pot, or maybe some small framed photographs.On the plus side, the flush mounted outlet strip at the top of the desk is very nice, and the LED strip gives it a cool aesthetic quality. All things considered, I think I'll get my money's worth considering I purchased it during a Black Friday sale. It's not a high quality desk by any stretch of the imagination, but it might prove adequate for our needs.I'd say this product deserves a good 4 out of 5 stars. It's a good choice for a budget shopper looking for a low cost solution (especially if you live in a small apartment).EDIT: The seller contacted me and thanked me for my constructive criticisms. They also mentioned they forwarded my feedback to the manufacturer. I have a lot of respect for their response to my review, so I'm giving it another star. Kudos to the seller of this desk for their outstanding attention to customer feedback and support.",

Depth of desk is smaller than expected. That is my own fault as I was mostly looking at the length for my space. Drawers are cloth except the front which wasn't stated in the description. A couple of the metal pieces has a small bit of rust, as shown in my third picture, but nothing that was of concern. Five stars overall based on quality for the price. I love the desk and really like that it has the power strip on top.",

                "reviewText": "I got this desk, since I just started a remote job and I needed a desk I could work on all day. The two drawers are big enough to hold files, and other office supplies. On this desk I am able to hold a printer, speakers, a 32 inch monitor, two 20 inch monitors, two laptops, keyboard and mouse, with space to add more if I wanted. The LED\u2019s are beautiful and where they sit, compliments the desk nicely. Something worth adding is that I have a mount for my 32 inch monitor, and laptop that I drilled through the top shelf, and into the desk. If you want to use a clamp mount on this desk be aware that you most likely will NOT have the room to do it, because the metal frames are in a spot that interferes with most clamps I\u2019ve seen. However, after drilling through the desk, I\u2019ve found out that the wood holds just fine and I don\u2019t worry about the mount falling. The upper shelf on the desk is pretty slim and though I\u2019m sure you could, I wouldn\u2019t personally sit a monitor on it unless it\u2019s pushed against the wall, but I don\u2019t have my desk positioned that way. All this to say, the desk is nice, it is easy to assemble, and it has enough space on it to hold quite a bit for someone who games and works from home. I would recommend. When I finish cable management I\u2019ll upload pictures",
