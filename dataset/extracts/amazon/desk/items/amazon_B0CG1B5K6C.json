The blue setting is a vivid blue. Not a deal breaker as it is primarily for decorative purposes. The strip of four 3-prong outlets are handy, as are the two USB-A ports (though one USB-C would have been a plus), it does not provide surge protection. Overall this is a nice piece of functional furniture at a good price.",

Sometimes the holes don't line up well or the parts are hard to differentiate. This desk had the parts and pieces numbered clearly and there were no struggles in lining everything up. My husband and I were in no rush but put this together for our daughter's in about 45 min.",
