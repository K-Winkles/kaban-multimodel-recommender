The wooden pieces were packaged in the center of the box for extra protection. The directions were easy to follow. I read a review that said the holes didn't line up but this was not our experience. There is one piece that connects the drawer to the desk that if NOT attached correctly it will not line up. Just flip it and it lines up perfectly. Best desk ever. I can't wait to get to work.",

My teenagers were doing me a favor though and when I was running an arrand,they started putting it together for me so I didn't know they sent me the wrong desk until I got home and they had already started. No way was I packing it back up and trying to send it back then. Little bummed that I didn't get the one I wanted,but this color is OK I guess too. I like the style. Great desk for the price. Would be nice to get a partial refund for the inconvenience of getting the wrong one though.",

If you are not good with furniture assembly then you might need some extra time. I'm very good with assembly of furniture of this type. Here's a suggestion: The box is big and has some weight to it. Place the box in the room you plan to have this desk in. Open and remove the parts and place them in some sort of order. Patience is need, so take your time and be sure to closely follow instructions. They are good instructions and some reviews might be negative in this area. You have to pay very close attention on the orientation of the pieces! The quality is good and the space is well in design. I have a 49\" ultra wide-screen monitor and still have plenty of desk space. Time of assembly, (Taking my time) was a about 2 hours. In the end this was a great investment/purchase for my needs. Hope this review helps you in your decision.",
