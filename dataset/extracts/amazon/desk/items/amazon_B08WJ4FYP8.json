For what I paid, I\u2019m very happy with it. The design is very good, and it arrived in great shape. Assembly wasn\u2019t too bad at all. Better than most Ikea products for sure. Obviously, it\u2019s a type of particle board with a wood pattern top. It seems plenty durable for me, and the size and style suit my purposes perfectly.The drawer hardware is decent and it works smoothly. I also like that the hairpin legs come with leveling feet and have rubber type pads to keep it stable and protect the floor. I\u2019d recommend this to anybody. I may even get another for a different room here.",

Came packaged with details to corner protection. I\u2019m assuming this is due to prior reviews of damaged upon arrival. An issue that was definitely thought through when packaging my most recent order.I purchased this as homework/laptop/drawing table for my youngest. She tends to be a little rough on things so I feel like might last us around a year. It\u2019s material that will not handle moisture or water well. I can tell it will peel and bubble, so keep in mind this will do best for someone who intends to use it lightly or for strictly paper/pencil type activities.The drawer pulls out and shuts with ease and provides more room than I imagined originally. Overall happy with the slim and modern design, mixed with enough space for functionality.",

There is one drawer with a divider inside which works great . I keep notebooks and files in the larger side and smaller stuff like stapler and supplies in the smaller section. The drawer slides open and closes easily. There is an open cubby to the left of the drawer which I like to put easily accessible more pending items in such as bill that need to be paid. Nice so I don\u2019t have to put everything on top where it would look cluttered. The desk is a good size. The material of course is nothing fancy or expensive but it\u2019s decent for the price. It did come with a small chip on the top corner but I just use black marker on it and you can\u2019t tell. Not worth returning. Was easy to put together. I did it by myself but it was a little time consuming",
