                "reviewText": "I had $150 in Amazon gift cards, so took a shot in the dark with this desk. The reviews were fine but you never know. I am VERY impressed. The assembly was fine, but not the simplest (the instructions were a little obscure sometimes). I am 6ft 2 and I always have a problem with desk height especially with my rudder pedals. I can finally put my chair up to its proper height and not hit my knees. There isn't much lateral movement, however. But that isn't something I neededThe width is great for all of my toys. The multi-level and the led strip add a bonus.The drawers were shockingly deep, (enough to fit a laptop) which I didn't expect but was a welcome surprise. I have only had it a few days but I really like the sturdiness and quality. I highly recommend this desk.Make sure you know your drawer layout before putting them in as you won't get many opportunities to switch around.",

                "reviewText": "Goes together well, solid design. The cloth drawers with reinforcing bottoms are heavier duty than I thought they would be; totally satisfied with them. This was the best design for me with the shelving, multiple layers, 4 drawers, 2 open shelves on the bottom left and right, built in multi outlet power strip with 2 USB charging ports. I first bought the 55 inch long model, it arrived damaged. After sending it back, I looked at numerous other computer desks. I just couldn't find anything even at twice the price, which ticked all of the boxes for what I wanted. And the 47 inch length is sufficient for me. This one suits my needs perfectly for a computer desk in a bedroom that looks stylish, not too big, not too small, and the one included feature I didn't need was the stick on LED light strip. I guess for some people that would be a cool feature. I didn't need it, gave the light strip away. One thing I didn't like about the entire desk was the LED light strip; in addition to being able to select from different colors, all green, all blue, all red, all white, you can adjust the dimmer control. This feature (dimming) did not work well at all. Each press of the button the included remote for the LED light strip, would incrementally lower the brightness. But after 1 step of brightness reduction (there were about 4 steps total) the LEDs had a flicker to them which I do not like. At full strength I didn't notice a flicker but when the brightness was dimmed 2 times out of say 4, or more than 2, it would definitely flicker. No problem for me, I didn't want the LED light strip anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Looks really nice when assembled. LED lights gives it extra appeal with the different colors. I like that it's made of sturdy materials but not too heavy to move around. It's perfect for personal use or if you don't work with a lot of files/paper.Cons: The screw holes are misplaced so you have to force it. The screws are really cheap so you only get one chance to screw in. Which leads to the next issue. The instructions are incorrect when it comes to the parts for the drawers. The instructions were not clear and I didn't realize it until it was too late. I am not able to unscrew the drawer slot to correct it because the screw is now warped. I suggest leaving the screws a bit loose for the drawer slots until you know for sure they're in the right spots.",

Some complained of the instructions not being correct but you have to understand that when it references front it doesn't mean the front of desk it is telling you which side of the desk should face you as you are assembling for that instruction. the desk is sturdy and has a really good quality look to it. I did have an issue with handles missing and the lights not working but the company sent replacement handles and a remote. Problem solved and lights work.",
