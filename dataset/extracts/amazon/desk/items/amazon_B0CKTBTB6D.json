I got the widest version avaliable. My desk has 1 horizontal 28 inch monitor, a horizontal 32 in monitor, and a vertical 28 inch monitor with a 75% keyboard, mouse, and other decorations. Plenty of mouse room and room for drinks and whatever. Suprisingly sturdy. I dont get a lot of wobble. It was super easy to build took like 30 min and it worked without a hitch. It moves up and down very smooth. Setting saved heights is a breeze and its quiet. The rustic oak wood looks amazing and at the price point you cant beat it. Very satisfied. The ONLY thing i dont care for is the headphone hook. It seems like a after thought. Very just flimsy cheap plastic but not a bad touch id say. 9/10.",

                "reviewText": "Every desk I looked at was either very cheap looking or stupidly priced. And a 48\" wide desk is too small for modern setups. This is one of the most affordable sit/stand desks I found, plus it was very easy to assemble and it looks nice. If you are looking for a clean, large, inexpensive, easy-to assemble sit/stand desk, this is the one to get. The instructions were easy to follow, and at 63\" wide, this can hold two monitors easily. (For reference, I have two 32\" monitors and a 14\" laptop on my desk in the 2nd picture.)A couple of minor things - first, cable management in real life is always a challenge and it never looks like it does in an ad. I have two monitors, each with a DisplayPort cable and a power cable, plus a docking station, power cord, charging cord for my phone, speaker wires, etc. To counter this, I purchased a small under-desk wiring basket meant to hold all of that crap. Second, the desktop surface is made up of two boards, not one, so you can see a seam running lengthwise. It sits flush so this is not a big deal at all to me, and if that helps keep the price in check I'm fine with it.In the first pic, you can see where I used one of the brackets to line up the length of the legs before assembling. You stick the rod in the leg (the one without the motor) and turn the rod a little until the length of that leg matches the length of the other one. Otherwise your desk will be crooked.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.",

While constructing, I noticed that the main table surfaces had dents and cracks. Some of them are smaller and on the bottom side of the panel. But there are a few that are right at the center of the board facing up. And given how nicely they were packed, I feel like it was not a shipping issue but rather them sending me a defective piece.I\u2019ll probably stick with it because shipping such a massive object after construction will be a hassle. But I am a bit disappointed as to how things turned out in the end.Otherwise, constructing it was easy. The whole support structure is sturdy and the motor movement is smooth.",

                "reviewText": "My first order one of the panels for the wood top of the desk was cracked (seen in first pics). Hopped online and spoke to the customer support and another one was ordered immediately. It took 3-4 days to get the first one, but the next one took a week. Not only that, UPS would say they attempted delivery, but I can assure you they didn\u2019t. It is quite heavy so I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t want to carry that into the mail room. Anyways, second one finally came in and guess what. One of the wooden panels was also broken. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t the one I needed. I was told by support they couldn\u2019t send separate fixed pieces so they gave me another one and I had to switch what I needed and return the rest. I was told UPS can pick up after scheduling a day. When I went to do that, the only option was to take it to the UPS store myself and have the return label on it. Luckily, I did not wreck the boxes both came in but they were right by the time they got to me. Even after putting it together with my \u201creplacement pieces\u201d there\u2019s scuffs on the edges (shown in pics). I was tired of working at my coffee table so I just sucked it up and worked with it. Installing it was easy enough. Took maybe 45min on my own. It\u2019s relatively quiet when you adjust height and it\u2019s smooth. It\u2019s wider than I thought but I still really like it. Only wish it didn\u2019t have a tendency to come damaged in transport.",
