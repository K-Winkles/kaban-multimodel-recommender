It was very easy to assemble it took me like 45 min to an hour to do this myself, if you have someone to help it would be faster. I do appreciate that it comes with little legs attachments where you can tighten or loosen in case you desk is wobbly or tilting to make it sturdy. It fits both my work 24 inch work monitors comfortably and even extra space. My laptop fits perfectly under the ledge and a standard keyboard as well. It does come with 2 drawers that are fabric material and the front piece is that wood material, if you're picky you might not like it. I dont mind as they are nice and sturdy, I can fit a standard binder in there with plenty of room. Overall im happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This desk is amazing, however it may be hard to do it by yourself there parts were you need someone to help you hold things. Other then that me and my dad finished this whole thing before the minion ride of gru movie ended. It is very cute and the drawers were very easy and I like the more then normal wood ones because wood ones add more weight which can break your desk. These drawers can fit a lot of things, the shelves you can adjust the heights however they aren\u2019t that big you can fit about one notebooks and a half on it. If you want to have many things in your desk maybe they more drawers or shelves but this fit me perfectly. The instructions were very clear just be mindful of how you put things together and how they are facing because there are many holes and you may get confused and take even longer to build the desk. Overall good desk, easy to build but the storage may be tough depending on how many things you plan on putting on the desk.",
