                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these desks, they were both easy to assemble and instructions where mostly clear on how to do either the left or right side installation. The only issue I had was when trying to put in the wood pieces, I didn't leave enough slack in my screws on the frame to get them into place easily. The instructions hadn't mentioned this at the time, but the owner has been informed of such and I hope to see the change in the future.Otherwise the wood, even though it is particle board like material, seems sturdy, enough for me to pull myself up off the floor when I had to adjust the bottom plate to sit more level. I can tell the box took quite the beating in shipment, but most of the desk seem unharmed, aside from one very small dent in the metal frame. The wood wasn't scratched at all despite there being a large gouge in one box. So I am pretty confident it can withstand a good bit of use without getting scuffed.Overall The look is beautiful, each piece of wood seems to have its own unique pattern even though it is just a printed laminate, and the design goes all the way around so you can decide which side to show off more.My only major disappointment with this desk is that there aren't more options for your shelving spaces. The largest space is only a fraction of an inch too small for my gaming computer tower, but I knew that before purchase. This is not a huge issue, as the tower is perfectly fine sitting on top of the desk, but doing so makes me sacrifice a bit of elbow room.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical with the price that this would be a very cheap desk upon arrival. However, after putting it together I found it\u2019s actually pretty sturdy. The work space with the shelf on top is large enough for a pad of paper and keyboard so the size is decent as well. Definitely won\u2019t be housing any majorly heavy items but I feel confident in my printer and computer calling it home.Regarding assembly: I put this together by myself and there were only a few moments that were slightly challenging but the assembly is relatively quick (maybe 25-30 minutes) and required very little effort aside from maneuvering with a few bulky pieces.",

                "reviewText": "Not reversible as advertised. Planned to have the shelves on the right hand side, but piece \"I\" was not dilled properly so it could only have the shelves on the left or the shelf on the back had to be left off. I wasn't about to start drilling holes to make it work. I've purchased and assembled a lot of furniture. The hardware wasn't labeled and the illustrations were just okay. The desk looks nice and goes together relatively easy once you figure things out, but the wood-like surface is very thin and one piece was chipped. I had to glue it back on. Not going to deal with shipping it back, but would not recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My son needed a desk because hisJob decided to have a bunch of employees work from home now & he needed this for his home office area...something compact & not huge because he doesn\u2019t have tons of space! He was looking for a desk that had enough room on the top of the desk to hold multiple monitors & keyboards...etc... and also fit in a small corner of our bedroom. This desk accomplishes all that! It looks awesome in his room!!! Nicely compact but still enough room for his needs! This nice desk is well-made and sturdy, and the open design keeps his office corner from looking stuffy & cluttered! The instructions were easy to read & follow. The hardware was packaged and labeled and there was a bag of extras. It came with a tiny wrench and Phillips head screwdriver, but he used a battery-powered driver to tighten the screws on the shelves...because it was faster & easier! I highly suggest having a second person to help with assembly and to put it together in the room in which it will be used. It\u2019s a bit hard for just 1 person! This desk is a great height & he is able to easily type on his keyboard and his desk chair fits nicely underneath. This desk is definitely one of our best purchases this year!!! We purchased the walnut color and it looks beautiful in his bedroom! He is extremely happy with this purchase!!! Awesome product! 5\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
