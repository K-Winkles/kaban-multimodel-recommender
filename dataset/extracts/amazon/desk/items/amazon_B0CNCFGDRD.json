                "reviewText": "This desk is great for studying and/or small PC setups! It is on the smaller side but it\u2019s still spacious and it does hold a lot for its size. I appreciate the upper and lower shelves, they\u2019re good for holding books, paperwork, collectibles, printers and much more. Assembly was fairly simple and took less than an hour for me, an instruction manual is provided which is very helpful. Overall I am very happy with this product I feel the quality is good for its value.",

This was perfect and it looked great.The desk arrived undamaged. I put it together and it was the perfect size for the space I had and I was able to put all my stuff on it.The instruction could use a rewrite but ultimately, I was able to figure out what to do when the instructions were lacking.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great value-priced desk with a decent quality thicken board table and a decent metal frame.The office desk offers dual functionality, allowing for assembly as either 67 67-inch corner desk or a 94.5-inch long office desk.It also features an automatic ON/OFF LED light function (Human body induction system) which will auto-light on when people approach within 2 meters and light off when people leave after 30 seconds. LED light strip has 3 color modes, white light, warm light, blue light, and long press to adjust the brightness from 10% to 100%.The metal frame is sturdy enough, but if you over-tighten it (which I did easily and often), the metal screw will pop out, so take caution when putting this together.The total time from opening the well packaged, (if not too overly packaged) desk, to finishing and cleaning up my mess from all of the Styrofoam packaging, was about 3 hours.I didn't use the monitor shelf because the shelf itself was too narrow for my oversized monitor and I wasn't able to place both the monitor and the keyboard on the desk itself because of its narrowness, so keep this in mind when looking at the specific needs for your monitor. I took off a star for that, as I think there should be a keyboard shelf under the desk table for proper use.The shelves on the desk itself are very handy and created a nice, neat appearance in my space.I needed to use another desk for my monitor and keyboard, but again, I have a large setup that most people may not have, so I expected that would be the case and did take this into account when getting this L-shaped desk.Just make sure of the dimensions of the desk and your monitor needs before purchasing.Overall, this desk is a nice-looking desk that fits very well in my small space and functions well for an unbeatable value price.",
