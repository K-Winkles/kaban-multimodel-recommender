                "reviewText": "I really like this desk so far. The hutch is decently sized with a streamlined design, and it fits perfectly in the corner of my bedroom. Easy enough to assemble, but a LOT of parts/screws that are a pain in the ass. However, I've already gotten compliments on it! My only complaint is that it's a bit rickety. Definitely sturdy enough to handle all my gear... just don't bump it too hard or heavily lean on it constantly. For anyone wanting to put their computer tower on the built-in stand near the floor: I have the Corsair Crystal 280X RGB Micro-ATX Case (see photo). It's a fraction of the size of standard cases and it fits perfectly in this desk, so the shelf is pretty narrow/low. You may want to check the dimensions for your build. Overall, happy with the purchase. :)",

With the video and the manual, the assembly is simple. 1 hour can be done. If you have an electric screwdriver at home, I suggest using it. The assembly time will be very short and the whole process will be easier. Overall it was perfect and suited my needs.",

The desk is easy to build and the instructions to me were dime to follow. It is very stable and quickly became my favorite place to sit and do my work because I was able to personalize my space better with the inclusion of the hutch. It makes my space feel so much more inviting. I definitely recommend this for anyone who spends a lengthy amount of time sitting at a desk, even gamers willvrnjoy the aesthetic this desk brings with it.",

So spacious and I appreciate the details here like the variety of orientation options, the addition of LED lights that are optional to add, the included power outlet with cutout, the cabinet on the side has two height options, the included optional monitor stand and even hooks to hang your headphones or something else. The wood is good quality and looks very nice.Building - It is fairly easy to build, just takes some patience. I was able to make it by myself with no extra tools except what was provided. Just read the manual and look at the pictures carefully and all the pieces are numbered for ease. There wasn't an installation video when I built it, but looks like there is one now! There was perhaps one step where the item might've been switched or I got confused but it was easy to figure out.",
