                "reviewText": "I needed two of these desks, but I ordered only one to start with to see what it was like. After receiving this desk and putting it together I was so pleased with it that I placed an order for the second desk.Before buying this desk I checked at some office stores for \"inexpensive desks\", and the prices in these stores was considerably higher and lesser quality than this desk is. I was concerned about the fabric drawers this desk has, because when I saw the fabric drawers in the desks in the office store, they were flimsy and horrible. But these drawers, even though they are fabric, are quite sturdy.The desk was very easy to assemble, all the parts were there (including extras). It looks nice, is lightweight (easy to move around), and will meet my needs as a laptop desk. By the way, some reviews on this desk complained that it's not as big as they thought it would. Since the measurements are included in the product description, and the measurements are accurate, I have a hard time understanding why they thought it would be bigger.",

The fabric drawers are a shock but they work and are mentioned in the description. The metal frame looks weak, but is surprisingly solid. Very easy assembly. I only have a small area to put a desk and it fits perfectly. Would make a great student desk. Would make a good bill pay desk. The top is thinner than expected, but overall for the price, I am happy with my purchase.",
