                "reviewText": "For years I was tormented by having limited desk space with my old desk. I had nowhere to put anything, and it was a cramped affair. This desk changed everything for me. I now have a place to put everything I want, right at my finger tips. I've got 2 work stations in an L shape, and so much room left over to put things that it's crazy. My full size PC tower fits perfectly under the shelves provided that go on the side. (Keep in mind that these shelves are mandatory to put on one side or the other. You cannot build this desk without the end cap book shelf). I am able to put my PS4 here with a second monitor, I've got room to store my PS Vita's and PS TV, my DAP, and my gaming laptop all in one. I've ever got enough room to put the storage bins there, and a few handfuls of games on the shelf. And I STILL have more room! This desk arrived in a compact box, and I was able to put it together by myself in 5 hours with hand tools that this company provided in the box(it'll be a lot less if you break out the power tools, which I was just too lazy to do.) Everything went together dummy easy and the instructions are very clear. The LEDs come in strips you'll have to put on by yourself, and are easy to use with the provided physical controller, and an app you can download. (It uses your location, so be careful when using it. I just use the controller most of the time and it does just fine on its own) This desk also comes with a straight piece, so you can assemble this desk straight outwards if you don't want the L shape. It's included in the box at NO EXTRA CHARGE! The cupholder can hold a full 32 oz bottle of orange juice without an issue, and the headphone holders are very helpful and will hold 2 full size sets of headphones.(pictured is my steel series wired and a set of astros I later threw in the bin because they gave out) Though the material used is the compressed wood, the way it's put together suggests serious quality control, and the end result is marvelous. The carbon fiber material they used is a great texture and doesn't scratch easily or get super dirty with use. Overall, this one gets 5 stars from me. For $140 you'd be very VERY hard pressed to find a better desk. I'd highly recommend this for multitasking as well. I use mine for work projects as well as gaming, and it'll handle the heat from a soldering iron just fine. Again, GREAT purchase.",

Normally, I keep boxes just in case we have to return, but I threw the box for this out. Won't be returning. This is a quality desk and we are beyond thrilled with it!
