                "reviewText": "Took me and the wife give or take a hour to assemble, everything was labeled correctly and the instructions were clear and easy to follow but the allen keys that are supplied are a bit on the smaller side so it made it difficult for me with larger hands to hold on and turn the key. The desk is holding all the weight i have on it pretty well, wobbles a little too much for my liking when i nudge it from rolling back from the desk or accidently nudge it when i turn in my chair. But overall you get what you pay for, its what you'd expect or maybe just a bit better (emphasis on bit) for the price that it is currently listed at (149.99).",
