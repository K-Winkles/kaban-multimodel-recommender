                "reviewText": "A week in, I love this desk. It fits perfectly in the corner (measurements accurate), and that I'm not worried to leave all my things and gear on it. The fact the monitor stand is removable but so sturdy is a god-send; being a mixed-media and digital artist, I can change my setup easily without worries. Rounded edges save me from injury each time. If I move out, I will bring this exact desk with me or buy the same one.-----More info on material and assembly:Upon first impression, the materials felt weighty and good quality; there was some slight surface damage on some of the metal pieces but once assembled, they are out of sight. The finish of the wood was nicer than I was expecting, it is a little cooler than the photos (I was choosing between beech or grey, and reading recent reviews, I made the right decision).For assembly, it took two people and a little over an hour. The instructions were pretty straight forward, but there were instances we thought we were wrong because some of the screws wouldn't secure in the holes smoothly. Also the extra pieces confused us, but I am grateful to have them, just in case.",

                "reviewText": "So I got my first PC setup thanks to my partner, and thus I had to get a desk. We are in a minuscule apartment, so space saving and inexpensive was the goal. Luckily, I found this listing. It wasn\u2019t too heavy to bring up, definitely something that\u2019ll make you a little sweaty but not in need of a helper (though take that as you will, it may still be too heavy to bring up on your own).The wood material is pretty light, the metal legs were the heaviest part. The instructions are completely picture-based, no descriptions besides the numbers corresponding to the pieces. All the hardware is in numbered bags, so I highly recommend keeping the individual pieces in their numbered baggies and taking them out one by one to avoid confusion. That being said, there was a part in the instruction booklet where the picture was so small I had to be really careful with putting the second shelf together, but otherwise it was very easy to put together. I even had extra hardware left over, which are now tucked away in a junk drawer in their numbered baggies.I\u2019m about a month and a half in, and I\u2019m really impressed with it. I\u2019m not a heavy-duty gamer or whatever, so I\u2019m not on this thing 24/7 for gaming. I have a dual monitor set up, and I found it best for myself to not use the second unattached shelf to house the monitors, but if you\u2019re taller than me it\u2019ll be beneficial to you. Yes, it is free floating and not physically attached to the desk, but it\u2019s easy enough to fix with a few strips of duct tape to help give it some traction (otherwise it\u2019s smooth wood on smooth wood).The shelf underneath the desk that is physically attached is a rather nice footrest. You can\u2019t put too much weight on it, but (I hope) no one plans to stand on it so it doesn\u2019t matter. Because I went with the black color option, I did find that it leaves slight scuff marks on my wall, but if you can spend another $2-3, then you can get those small felt furniture disk things that go under the legs of you chair to stop it from scuffing the floor. I just cut one in half, stuck it to the back and sides that meet the wall, and the problem was solved.This is a great desk for computers, general desk work, studying, art, whatever you need. It\u2019s deep enough that I\u2019m not fighting for space for my arms or keyboard or whatever, but it still doesn\u2019t take up much space in my tiny overpriced apartment. I hope you like it too, if you get it.",
