                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with my new desk! It provides me with what I wanted: a broad work surface that's much like working on a table top, and plenty of storage so I can tuck all my supplies away. There's enough space to work with multiple books, a notepad and desk lamp, with my macbook and my drink at opposite ends, for the sake of safety.The pictures in the listing don't do it justice. t's not made of solid wood, but for the price, it's more than reasonably sturdy. Once assembled it doesn't feel wobbly or suspect. It's not solid wood, but it's quite heavy and very handsome. I haven't had any problem with the drawers being wobbly or not gliding smoothly. The screws which set up the slides are easily accessible, so they can be adjusted if need be. NB: the pencil drawer is just that, it's for pencils and notepads, it's not the place to store your collection of coins and lead figurines. Conveniently, the max load for each drawer is listed in the book.Assembling the desk did take several hours, working alone. If you can follow instructions and interpret pictures, it's not too taxing. The drawers were the most complicated bit, but once you do the first, the rest work the same way. I didn't have any missing or damaged pieces. One corner has a tiny chip in the veneer, but it's most likely I'm responsible for it and a touch of scratch pencil will fix it right up.Yes, the hardware comes all jumbled together. I sorted the pieces out in an ice cube tray before I started, to make I had them all (there were extras) and to make it easy to find what I needed as I worked. Not every piece is labeled with a sticker - some had the letter printed on the edges. The others were pretty obvious, and if you still can't figure it out, there's a visual guide in the instruction book. It was easier to put together than some of my Ikea pieces because it has text, not just pictures. The box it comes in is very heavy; most people will need a second person to get it in the house. The weight of the box was impressive. You shouldn't try to turn the desk upright on your own either - it won't work and you'll risk damaging it. There are no holes in the desk for cords. The back of the desk isn't as attractive as it could be (behind the drawers on the right is particleboard), so it's not the best choice to place in the middle of a space.",

                "reviewText": "I paid $211 before tax to buy this desk as an early Xmas present for my wife: the desk is beautiful, my wife loves it, and I consider the price more than fair. It's heavy, of course, slightly over 100 lbs, and the assembly appeared daunting enough ( a lot of hardware) that I paid someone $50 to do it. Daniel works on houses for a living and it took him just over 2 hours to assemble the desk - which means it would take most people an entire day (he's very fast). Here's a tip I discovered when I was still considering doing it myself. Most, or all of the larger, darker pieces have stickers on them, part A, B, C, etc. However, on the smaller, lighter-colored pieces I didn't see any stickers, so I was thinking all the pieces weren't marked. Upon closer inspection, however, I noticed the letter and number were lightly carved into them. It's fairly small; you have to look close. Which brings me to the part I was most impressed with. Customer service. Part D37 was broken on arrival. I had Daniel use it anyway, but I called customer service to ask for that piece in case mine didn't hold up. I can't remember if there was an automated system, but if there was it was short and to the point - not the type that makes me want to fling the phone through the window. I do remember that it took almost no time before I was speaking to this really nice lady named Abby who apologized for the inconvenience, asked for the minimum order details, and said the piece would be in the mail by the next morning at the latest. The whole phone call took 2-3 minutes, and the piece was in my hand in about 5 days. You don't see customer service like that anymore! At least I don't. Thank you, Abby. Thank you, Sauder. I came away impressed by your company.",

I usually make my own furniture but sometimes I buy pieces like this and this is the best brand for furniture in a box. This desk could actually be moved from one house to the next and not fall apart during the move. The instructions were awesome. Actually written by a person who speaks English and has assembled it enough times so they included the right details so you can put it together right the first time. Assume this will take a while to put together. Assume at a relaxed pace 3 to 4 hours for the first one. If you are quite proficient, 2 hours.As to the look of the desk, it looks great. As to the function of the drawers, great and adjustable. But they do require tuning so everything works and fits together smoothly.Shipping with prime, 2 days.",
