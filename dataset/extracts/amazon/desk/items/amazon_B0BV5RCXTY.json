                "reviewText": "I purchased this desk to solve a space problem. My old desk was just not right. I read the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very easy to put together. The instructions are not the greatest but if you have built IKEA furniture ( or work with LEGO\u2019s) then following the visual directions is easy. However, for someone who doesn\u2019t have much building experience, it would be nicer if they offered a link with the directions broken down into more steps. There is once piece that could easily be attached wrong and that could cause a new builder some aggravation. The price of this desk is very affordable and the quality is better that I expected for something in this price point. One of the key suggestion I can give you is to separate the parts into the steps ( including the tools) so you can access the contents and components. It will make putting it together very efficient and improve your building experience. I am very happy with the way it looks, works and the quality of the materials.",

                "reviewText": "I could not find a desk designed for a full size tower cpu on Amazon unless I bought a HUGE two piece desk. Only rich people have the space for one of those monstrosities. As a compromise this desk is adequate and better than the majority of its competitors.Sturdy, minimalist, and relatively easy to assemble. The desk is shallow - recommend you use a tape measure to help visualize it's depth. Monitor stand is nice and provides some good space for picture frames,speakers, and knickknacks. The website photos imply you can put a mouse pad next to the keyboard. You can, but 1/3 of the mouse pad will be under the keyboard :-). It would be nice if the keyboard tray was 3\" wider and had a lip on the bottom front to help grip it. The desk has two CLOTH drawers, which I just shake my head at. I would think some kind of thick, hard paper product would work better. However, if you're going to have it, improve it. Put 3 evenly spaced holes in the rear edge of the drawer base. Provide wire ties that can be used to secure the base to the rear desk frame. This will stabilize the drawer bases and prevent them from floating around, which they do now.I am satisfied with this desk. It meets the need, was easy on the wallet, assembled easily (exceptional instructions - kudos to the writers!), and I like its spare, minimalist look.",

Great to have the monitors at one level with the keyboard and mouse (yes, both fit) on the keyboard tray, leaving the whole desktop for projects that still use paper. The assembly was fun, though not fast. Instructions were clear. All the parts were included and in good order. The frame, shelves, and keyboard drawer feel sturdy, well, more than sturdy enough for their intended use. I wouldn't sit or stand on them. The fabric side drawers are working fine. They are the least sturdy part; I do wonder how long they will last. Count me a pleased costumer who feels that he has gotten good value for the price. I use it every day.",

I have never put anything together other than anything but tech or mechanical. This was super easy; the desk is the 55inch one and was massive. I love the drawers. I see that I have 3 monitors, so I should have gone for the bigger but where would I put it? All in all, sturdy practical, came with a coupon and I got it in white, to go with my bamboo items.

I was worried about putting it together, but when it arrived every piece in the box was clearly labeled and the directions for assembly couldn't have been easier! I think it took my son and I just over an hour to complete it. The top tier for my monitors really frees up all of the space underneath. I do wish that the keyboard tray was a little bit deeper, but it's not the end of the world. By the time I put my keyboard and wrist rest it just about took up all the whole thing. Would definitely recommend it!",
