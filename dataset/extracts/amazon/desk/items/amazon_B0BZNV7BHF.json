                "reviewText": "Good design on the desk, but terrible quality control and zero customer support. The problems: 1) One of the legs was badly dented and the plastic foot can not be attached. 2) One of the corners on the top had part of the lamination broken off. 3) Several places on the metal sections were dented or scratched. 4) Difficult and time consuming to assemble. 5) The driver that was included did not include a HEX bit. Many of the screws are hex screws. Without a hex bit, it is impossible to tighten these screws properly. I wrote the company explaining the issues. They were completely unhelpful and finally told me they \"couldn't find me\" in their system even though I provided my order number twice! I will not buy from this company again.",
