                "reviewText": "I searched for months to find a desk tall enough to fit over my radiator, and this desk was what I ended up with. I have very little experience with assembling/building, but was able to get this done in about 30 minutes. Very clear instructions, no parts were damaged. There ARE two people required for the final step, but only for about 30 seconds.Desk looks clean, chic, and modern. Lightweight enough to move, but sturdy enough to not tip. Feels substantial when you work on it, doesn't wobble. Plenty of space for laptop, various textbooks and notebooks spread out. The upper shelf is super handy and cute to set plants, photos, etc on. I was hesitant to drop this much money on a desk, but compared to Target, Ebay, Kohls, Etc....if you need a tall(er) and small(er) desk...this is a wonderful deal. Trust me. I searched for HOURS and settled on this.ONE con is that the surface scratches very easily. Having it on my floor during assembly, I got a 3in long, .5in wide scratch on the top of the desk. Scratch is white, desk is black. Still not sure how it happened. I have a smooth wood floor and the piece was unblemished upon arrival. Assembly was gentle. I guess everybody should assemble this thing on a blanket, or be super careful to not drag it over anything.",

                "reviewText": "This is a solid desk. Would definitely buy again!PROS:-The key reason I purchased this desk was the potential for posture. Ability to have screen and keyboards/mouse at different heights is crucial for me as i prefer ergonomic set ups.-Sturdy desk and construction. It also provides additional storage space while staying compact which I appreciated.-Looks great and seems like it will wear well. You can tell it's veneer at the edges but that's consistent with it's pricing. Great value for the price.CONs:-Minor detail - because tiers are offset, it's easy for things to fall off the back of the larger base surface area. Would be nice to have a back lip in line with the top shelf.-Minor detail - tricky assembly, i had to go rough from the order the instructions were written. I couldn't get the main desk to fit between the upper shelves' legs once they were already screwed in. Had to unscrew one leg, attach both ends of main desk then screw final upper leg on.-Minor detail - Several screws were stripping (3-4). Everything attached decently but if I had to break down and rebuild, it would be tough to get those out and would definitely need new screws to rebuild.",

                "reviewText": "- EXTREMELY WELL PACKAGED. I was fighting with the packaging for like ten minutes lol! The box is GLUED shut not taped, there's thick paperboard AND plastic corner protectors, Styrofoam all around the edges, every leg it tightly bagged and has a cardboard pad on the top, this is a VERY well-protected item. Absolutely pristine out of the package.- Tools are NOT included. You will need a Ph2 screwdriver and I highly recommend you get a shortish thinnish one because the hairpin legs make screwing a little, well, screwy. I only had average length 'drivers and had problems. A mini length screwdriver is your friend! You'll also need a larger Phillips and a rubber mallet. I recommend having a rubber mallet on hand just bc there are cam screws and I always like a rubber mallet for tapping those in all the way. Saves my fingers some pain.- Like with ANYTHING made of particle board covered by laminate, be CAREFUL and PATIENT with building this, and ONLY USE HAND-TOOLS and DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN. I cannot stress this enough. Over-tightening is a terrible habit. You only need to tighten it enough to be flush, that's ALL. It does not take long but do set aside enough time to *take* your time, and read the instructions carefully. Arrogance ruins furniture.- There were only enough bits and bobs for exactly as many as you needed. Unforch this was bad because 1 of those screws looked like Muzzy had tried to eat it. Luckily I dug around and had a spare that had approximately the same size thread and was a suitably similar length, but be aware. Also the screws are a bit softish so don't use power tools. You shouldn't be using power tools to put this kind of thing together anyway.- The type of particle board is what I would call mid-grade--it's solid, not hollow, but the particles are a bit biggish. IKEA quality.- I got the espresso and the colour is gorgeous! I was worried it would look discernibly brown (I picked espresso bc it was the closest to black there was available--I really wish this straight-up came in black), but it looks very black, I like that. Like a cup of espresso, not ground beans.- The instructions tell you the weight capacity on the back of them! I think the shelf said 40kg and the desk is 70kg? something like that? I'll check tomorrow and edit this review.- The legs have a sort of speckly dark grey/grey finish which is cool with me. Adds a bit of visual interest that I actually rather like better than if they were just solid black, as I thought they were from the photos.- Speaking of the instructions, they're very clear and easy to understand.I knocked a star off because they should really tuck a little screwdriver in to help you with the screws that are on the acute-angle side of the hairpin legs, and because of that mangled screw; but I would buy this again and I would recommend it to my friends, family, and you! It's an excellent little piece, feels very sturdy, and has a phenomenal look for the price point it's at!",

I was able to put a lot of my stuff at the top shelf and use the bottom one for my laptop. However, 2 months ago I noticed this sticking substance on my desk. I initially thought my kids had put a candy or glue on my desk. I cleaned it up. It was no longer sticky, but still had this \"watermark\" look. A week later, the stickiness and gooie substance was back. It has gotten bigger now. I have no idea why it's happening, but I have a feeling I will have to throw the desk away before it messes with my things.",
