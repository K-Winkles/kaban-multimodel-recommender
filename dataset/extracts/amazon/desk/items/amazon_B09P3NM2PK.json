                "reviewText": "The standing desk is sturdier than I expected, even when at full height. I've been using it for 3 days. So far, I am very happy with it. I have added several things to it such as an additional power strip, a tray to hold power adapters, and a drawer. I would have liked to buy a desk that had all those items plus casters but I was unable to find one that checked all the boxes for me. I purchased this desk as it had casters, met my minimum area requirement, and was reasonably priced.The cons to buying this desk. (I was aware of them before buying.) The top comes in 4 pieces (59\" version). I was hopeful that the gaps between the pieces would not be too much, and they are not too bad, but they will be crumb catchers for sure. That is the bad thing about having a table top in multiple pieces. I made a decision to live with it, which is why I went with this desk. If you want a desk that will look nice, this is not it. If you are fine with this one detail then it is a good desk for you. Another issue is the mat that comes with it is folded and will not lay flat. Perhaps after some time it will lay flat but right out of the box, it will not work well. I did not plan to use it as I have a very nice one that I have been using.I really like this desk and would recommend it if you are aware of the multiple sections for the desktop.Some operational notes:- I received a message from the seller a few days after my purchase that stated, \"Our standing desk has an upward anti-collision function, but no downward anti-collision function\". I was a bit put off by this as I would think that should be clear in the description. I actually think downward anti-collision would be more important as I could see that to be the most likely way for damage or injury. To be fair, most likely this is true for all standing desks but it is not stated.- By default, the display shows the height in centimeters instead of inches. I did find that pressing the \"v\" button twice while it is in the lowest position will change the units displayed. It would be nice if there was an instruction page that stated that although it is possible that I missed it.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I've added some photos showing when it was assembled and some photos with the drawer, tray, dual monitor mount, and additional power strip mounted.",

I could sit as this thing adjust down quite low, below what I would actually need and I\u2019m not tall really. So I guess if you\u2019re a little goblin it might not be low enough. Also if you are really tall I don\u2019t know what to say for you. If you aren\u2019t average height, do better.It adjust quietly and at a speed fast enough not to grow a beard while you wait but slow enough not to spill your coffee everywhere and become the phantom of the opera\u2026in your pants.It is made of some sort of hard wood and metal so it shouldn\u2019t break unless you are getting body slammed into it.It\u2019s quite easy to use and even has presets if you are too lazy to just hit a button. But i think if you are that lazy maybe you just should stick to sitting around being a lazy slob.It weighs a lot but has the ancient technology of wheels\u2026weee!There is a set of places to plug your stuff in. You\u2019ve got the power to do your job!! Finally.My favorite activity is move it up and down on zoom meetings and do that thing where I act like I\u2019m walking up and down stairs.Cheers!",
