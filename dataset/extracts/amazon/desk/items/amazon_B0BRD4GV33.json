The material was much sturdier than I expected. The boards felt like actual wood and not that cheap particle board I'm used to in these desks and the metal added great structure.My only complaints are 1) My PC Tower didn't fit in the shelf designated for it, and 2) The moniter stands are not big enough for my 27\" curved moniter. Both of those are probably user error, but still annoying enough to lose a star.",

Only 1 corner was damaged and not bad enough to send it back. All of the attaching bolts and screws come with extra in case you loose or damage one. It went together easy enough, looks nice and is not wobbly. I like it and would buy it again if I needed a light duty desk.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Looks nice when set up but there\u2019s a few issues that aren\u2019t clear when looking at the listing..1) the drawer and filing cabinet are both fabric. There\u2019s a front \u201cwooden\u201d piece, but they\u2019re just flimsy fold out drawers. It is particle board, with a wood finish, and the rest of the drawer is just a few pieces of fabric. The filing cabinet drawer does have metal rods to hold the files BUT they\u2019re both flimsy. The top drawer has rounded edges on the bottom and the bottom has pointed edges, both of which came damaged. It definitely still works, but feels like it diminishes the quality a bit.2) The monitor stands are not actually attached to the desk itself. They\u2019re separate pieces with rubber \u201cgrips\u201d to hold them in place. Not ideal for a heavy monitor. I have had my Mac desktop on them and if you try to move the stands with any weight on them, the bottom grippies will rip right off. There are no grips left on the stands as of now.3) the side with the filing cabinet leaves space for a chair BUT the side with the shelves would be very difficult to use as it is too small for legs to fit in a chair. Will use it for a while and see if my opinion changes. *update*: a gaming chair seems to fit fine and I haven\u2019t had any issues with fitting in the desk. Both sides seem to work and I do like sitting at it. I have not raised the legs at all, and have it on the carpet, and it is a good height.I bought it on cyber Monday and the price was reduced so I\u2019m feeling like I got what I paid for, but consider the above issues before buying.",

I liked the looks of it in the listing as it appeared to have ample flat space. The two monitor stands are not attached but do have silicone feet to prevent movement. As such, you can put them wherever you want. Also, the instructions include setting up the desk two different ways to better suit your space. The instructions were very clear and concise though there were a couple of diagrams that I had to study to make sure holes were pointed in the right direction for upcoming pieces. There are adjustable screw-in feet so the desk can be leveled. It appears to be pretty sturdy.",
