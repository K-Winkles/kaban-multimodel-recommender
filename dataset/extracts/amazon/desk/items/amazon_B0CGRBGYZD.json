                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews, but I thought this would be a good time for one if anybody is curious about buying this item.This is not your average put together desk.. it took about 30 to 45 minutes to complete, but worth the time.The desktop is made of pretty good laminated 1/2\" plywood that did not even scuff or scratch whenever I dropped my drill on it while building the desk \ud83d\ude02The frame is made out of a pretty dense aluminum and it has support brackets that you install to double down on durability. This thing is STRONG and STURDY and that's what I was most worried about.AS FOR SPACE, there is plenty of it to go around. The long end of the desk could easily fit two curved monitors (27\"-32\" monitors) , even the short end with the shelf could fit a couple 27\" monitors I'd say. The shelf that holds your PC has adequate amount of space for a pretty decent size PC. (Opening is 9 3/4 x 19 3/4).The dual LEDs are awesome and have like 6-8 different colors, the single LED strip has a daylight(broght white) and a nighttime calming light(yellowish white)And it has TWO power bank strips with three plugs(x2 = 6 power plugs total) and two USB ports(x2 = 4 USB total)...I WAS WORRIED.. BUT 100% WORTH THE MONEY, EASY TO PUT TOGETHER, STRUDY, AND GREAT LOOKING10/10 RECOMMEND \ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "Was pretty self explanatory to build. You can build it either way you want it to be so it can fit any corner of the room. The only negative thing I have to really say about it is that it\u2019s not very deep when it comes to width. Not much mouse pad space if that makes sense. Then again I didn\u2019t give it a lower than 5 star because that\u2019s not the manufacturers fault it\u2019s mine for not looking more closely at the dimensions. That being said it\u2019s a great desk. Just beware if you want a ton of mouse room you will have to mount your monitor to clear off that portion of the desk. Lights work. Cheap quality but that is to be expected when lights get thrown in with a product. Build quality is nice. I can sit in my desk and it doesn\u2019t budge. Pretty easy to put together. I would recommend this to anyone I know as long as they know about the little mouse space. If you mount your monitor there is plenty of mouse space btw. I\u2019m speaking for people who use the original monitor stand to their monitors. Happy Gaming!",
