Easy to follow instructions as well. Package was sorta heavy only because I\u2019m weak. Color of the wood matched ad. The shelf is detached and can be moved anywhere, or not used at all. You can put a filing cabinet underneath, or a three drawer organizer with plenty enough leg room. I can\u2019t recommend enough. A great price!",
