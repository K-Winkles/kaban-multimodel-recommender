                "reviewText": "First off package came damaged but desk was okay no damage. Second pay real close attention to the details if flipping the l shape side. Even if you do you still might have to backtrack, it\u2019s part of the experience. Okay when installing the screws that hold the plugs down on the desk, be prepared to replace those screws with some short ones that have bigger girth as the ones included are to small to hold it down when you start pulling plugs out . Trust me on this one get the fattest screw you can fit in the hole but not too long. Finally be prepared that the led light will stop working. Ours did on day one, stuck on white light no remote contact remote working it\u2019s just not having any affect. The desk though looks great my kid LOVES it but be warned the things above are real issues you should prepare for.",

                "reviewText": "This desk is easy to put together and the little YouTube videos help a lot if you are putting it together alone. I love how it\u2019s interchangeable for which side you want the L on. The storage draw and pocket are great! It\u2019s a great go to start desk for a gamer! Only sad part is the LED lights just stopped working. We tried unplugging and plugging it back in. We tried changing the battery on the remote. Nothing worked. So that kinda sucks but it\u2019s still a great desk.",

We love the light which I hope continues to work according to some other reviews. I purchased extra light strips just in case. Seems sturdy and I like the carbon fiber look.Update after three weeks the led light that it came with when out. Glad I got extra hopefully I can get the old one off to put better lights on there.",
