I have already recommended it to multiple people and will continue to do so. Building my Lego have never felt more safe. It doesn\u2019t wobble every time I bump into which is a huge plus !!

My only problem was during assembly I had some trouble getting some of the screws to line up perfectly. However, a little extra effort on my part was enough to get the thing together. The desk is reversible, meaning you can assemble the overhead compartment and PC holder on either side according to your liking. I've been using it every day for about 4 months now and it is still completely sturdy and looks brand new. Very nice desk for the price-point.",

The desk was packaged very securely & with good instructions. I did have a guy carry it upstairs for me while it was still in the box because it was to heavy for me that way but the actual pieces are quite light on their own, so putting it together alone wasn't a problem. It seems sturdy enough and the drawer is decent. The only problem is that the sticky on the back of the light strip doesn't seem to be strong enough & I had to use electrical tape to hold it up on both ends after a few days but otherwise the desk is great.",

Full disclosure, I didn't personally put the desk together, my fiance did, however, he said it was super easy and didn't take him long at all! I absolutely love it! The size is perfect for what I needed, and it feels sturdy, even after I filled it with all of my jewelry making stuff!The only complaint I have is with the LED lights that come with it. We went to put them up under the shelf, however, the sticky part is on the tape you peel off instead of the LED strip! Going to try some Velcro patches, hopefully that will get the strip to stay.I still give this desk a 5 star review, because really, I didn't buy it for the LED lights, they were just a bonus. The desk itself is beautiful, sturdy, a great size, and easy to assemble!",

                "reviewText": "This desk was exactly what I was looking for and at a price that can\u2019t be beat. The value here is very high in my opinion. Construction was pretty straightforward and took me about 45 minutes to build it alone. The only thing you will need that doesn\u2019t come included is a Phillips head screwdriver. The best features for me is the shelf and built in power strip. I enjoy building Gundam models and collecting little knick-knacks so a shelf was high on my list of priorities when choosing a desk. The cubbies, along with the top shelf, offer the perfect amount of space for these things. The power strip fits snugly into the surface of the desk and comes with four outlets and two usb ports. Perfect for keeping cables nice and tidy.To keep things short, at this price point I couldn\u2019t be happier with this desk. It was easy to assemble, had the features I was looking for, and is sturdy and seems to be good quality. I highly recommend if you\u2019re in the market for a cheaper option desk for your home office.",

After looking around in different furniture sellers and online furniture stores, we finally resorted to Amazon, as we were struggling to find something we wanted within our budget (moving expenses can skyrocket really quick). I loved this piece but I was honestly a little bit worried, as the price was too good to be true.The desk was delivered extremely quick (arrived at the new place a day before we were in!, but that is my faul!). Assembling it was really easy as the instructions were very clear, and you kind of assemble different pieces of it, and then put it together. The desk is sturdy enough to handle some weight, and my weight, as I usually lean against it often. I personally love that I have enough space to have my legs comfortably under it, as it was a problem I had with previous desks.Definetely recommend to anyone looking for a similar desk, as it offers more value for the money as other options in the market.10/10.",
