The only warning / downside is that this desk is heavy and comes in a very heavy box. I had to open it and transport pieces one by one upstairs. If you're unable to carry or have someone help with the box, be prepared for how heavy it is! But the upside is a great sturdy desk that is the new star of the office setup I have!",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews, but this product and seller warrants one. This desk is incredible, especially at this price. It took awhile to assemble, but what shipped furniture doesn\u2019t? It came with all the tools needed as well. It shipped in the original box which had some damage on the outside, but none of the wood was broken or scratched at all. The file frame for the bottom drawer was broken, however. I emailed the seller who responded promptly, asked for photos, confirmed the part, and shipped out a new one. If I don\u2019t receive it, I\u2019ll update this review, but I can live without it at this price point. They were very easy to work with and responsive. Highly recommend this product and seller!",

Everything fit perfectly, all the components were organized and labelled, they included extra pieces of everything, and it came with the tools you need, too. The instructions were very detailed and simple to follow. This desk is perfect for my work/study station which needed an L-shaped desk with enough space for my printer, laptop, ipad, desktop, and my books. The power bar is also very useful - it comes with 4 outlets, 2 usb-a ports (one is for the LED lights if you want them on), and 1 usb-c port. I only wish the drawer handles weren\u2019t plastic because they look and feel very cheap, but once you screw them in, they are sturdy and blend into the black finish so it doesn\u2019t really matter.Edit: I have a slight complaint that the finish is very prone to fingerprints but otherwise, it\u2019s a great desk and worth the money!",
