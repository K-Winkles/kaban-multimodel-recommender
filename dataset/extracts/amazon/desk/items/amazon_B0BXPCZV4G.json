I did start to assemble a piece backward, so pay attention to the holes on the bars, but it was an overall easy assembly. Once we got the first desk put together, the second one came together in half the time! They are very sturdy and hold up well to my wiggly 11-year-old leaning all over them. They also look very nice together and have plenty of room for our chairs so that we don't bump into each other. It was a perfect buy!",
