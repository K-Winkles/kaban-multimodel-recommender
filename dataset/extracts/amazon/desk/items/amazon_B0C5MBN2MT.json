                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic desk for not being a solid, one-piece desk. It's not very heavy so it was easy to walk into my home, as long as someone was there to help me. It's awkward and bulky so I don't recommend moving this on your own unless you're very confident.This took me less than 2 hours to put together. The instructions are pretty helpful. It would have taken me less time if I didn't try watching the video that's in the listing. The video wasn't helpful.A tip for putting it together: keep the box as support for when you flip the desk over so you can attach the feet/desk legs. There's a photo of this suggestion in the instructions. You'll also want a Philip head screwdriver which isn't included but the two hex keys/Allen keys they provided were the main tools used. The screwdriver was only for the plastic hook you can (optionally) screw into the underside of the desk.Functionality:It rises and lowers very quietly and fairly quickly. I love that you can store four different height settings to the desk. The controls are easy to figure out and look great.Overall, the quality was surprisingly great and it was a great buy! If I bought this in-store, I would have overpaid for something similar, unless you're only looking for solid,one-piece desks. This is a two-piece, split desk top. I can feel it bow slightly when I fully rest my elbows on the desk while standing, but that's to be expected. The desk also looks really nice and doesn't look cheap.",

                "reviewText": "It wasn't exactly a breeze to put together and I wanted to use it for a while before posting. I did follow the instructions and they were easy enough to follow. It is quite a heavy box. Once I was able to open it up it was better, I'm not strong so if I can do it, anyone can! I've been using it to WFH every day now for a couple months and it's still just as nice as day one. The packaging was damaged upon arrival but they had this sucker packed tight in foam so nothing inside was affected. I LOVE the glass top on it because it makes it nice and clean looking, sleak, and light. The motor works fine going up and down when I'm ready to stand up or sit and since there isn't a drawer taking up space underneath, it's even better. It's wide enough for my two 20\" + monitors to be side by side and extra knick knacks and supplies as well. It made my office/craft space look nicer.",

                "reviewText": "I had been using a four-foot, basic desk when working remote from home over the past year. I purchased this product primarily for the sit-to-stand feature, but I also liked the second tier and the storage space. Delivery was prompt. Product was very well packaged with good amounts of Styrofoam to protect from damage. All directions are in a diagram/photo format, so I did have to pause and think a few times about what it was telling me to do, but I wouldn't say it was \"difficult.\" I put the desk together by myself, and it took about two hours. A second person would have been helpful, especially when turning the desk back to upright position after assembly, but it's doable solo. (Someone who can't lift heavier items or with back issues might struggle.) The desk assembled exactly as it should. I did originally replace the floor \"pads\" with the optional wheels which elevates the desk about 2.5 inches; but after sitting with the desk at the lowest position, the keyboard was too high, my chair would not go up enough to compensate, so I removed the wheels and went back to the original pads on the legs. This accounted for a bit of that time to assemble, since I was doing it by myself. I absolutely love the ability to lift and lower. My back already feels better. The storage baskets offer the *perfect* touch for all of those little items you want to keep hidden. I have no issues with how the wires are placed (a concern mentioned by someone else). I find it to be very sturdy and offers more than enough space for what I need.Bonus feature: Doubles as a cat perch for Mr. Gato.I've already recommended to a friend!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this desk for my work from home job after my doctor recommended a standing/sitting desk. It's a very cute desk. It's sturdy, hods two monitors nicely, and doesn't take up too much room for it's size.The controls are easy to figure out and program. I love that it has four options. They're also very slim an unobtrusive. The motor isn't hidden but I'm not that concerned about it.The only reason this is getting four stars instead of five is that I didn't get an instruction booklet. I reached out to the company and they were kind enough to try and help. I ended up finding a PDF online before they reached out, but the fact they did in general is why this stayed at four instead of three.I definitely recommend this desk for anyone who's on the fence. Just be warned that you may not get an instruction booklet.",
