                "reviewText": "I bought this desk over 2 years and it has been a game changer for programming. 55\" is enough space to place both my laptop and an extra monitor and lamp. I love the fact that I can adjust it, whether I want to keep the table at the height of my arms, move it up so that my chair can slide underneath, or make it high enough so that I can stand. This desk does it all. I like the 4 preset buttons. It makes setting these different heights very easy and convenient to restore.The desk did take a little time to setup, but once it is setup it is very solid!! I think one of the main factors between this and other desks is that this doesn't have a solid table top. The mouse pad does a good job of covering the seams between the 3 pieces.I don't know how the long the motor will last for, but it has been good for 2 years of usage.I had some high frequency buzzing coming with the A/C adapter but I was able to receive a new adapter after pinging customer support.All in all, great desk. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "When I got approved to work from home part time, I knew I wanted a standing desk. This was affordable, easy to assemble and the motor is quiet. Even though the top is 4 pieces, it's remarkably smooth.No, it's not going to be wobble free - if you're used to a standard 4-legged desk, you'll run into this with any desk that only has two legs. These aren't meant to be leaned on. If you need to do that, get a regular desk or one with 4 legs.We've purchased several different iterations of \"affordable\" standing desks for employees, and this one is in the top two. Very happy with it.The only issue I've encountered, and it's pretty minor, is that the adjustment doesn't allow you to easily increase or decrease by ONE increment - it'll jump 2 or 3. However, I've been able to get it to a comfortable height with very minimal frustration.",

I reached out to the seller via amazon's website and they got back to me quickly and had 2 replacement parts sent and received within days. They were easy to replace and got the desk working again. I just hope that the new parts used to power the desk do not become defective again, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.",
