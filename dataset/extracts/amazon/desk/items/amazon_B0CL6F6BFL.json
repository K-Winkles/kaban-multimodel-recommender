                "reviewText": "So I bought a desk without any reviews. That was a really big deal for me but the features seemed to be just right and so did the specs. This will be a long post.I decided to buy this desk because of the storage and the style. I originally wanted an L-shaped desk but learned they take a lot of space. This desk fit perfect.Pros: the desk seems sturdy and very well built. I was able to build the desk by myself and I\u2019m a whole 5 ft tall. It took about 4 hours which was expected and I made sure I had the time to devote to it. It\u2019s not super heavy after fully assembling it, I\u2019m still able to glide the desk across the floor even though it\u2019s quite large. The desk top is very spacious and will work well for days I work from home. I love the option for plugs and usb ports on the top so I don\u2019t have to constantly fumble with a power strip. My printer has a great place to sit on top of the drawers, and that\u2019s my favorite thing about this desk! Cleaning will be a breeze for the top. It was pretty dusty but wiped down well. The openness under the desk is great for cleaning. I just had my flooring installed and I can really sweep and mop below the desk.Cons: the delivery package is VERY heavy because of how many parts are packed in. If I a return needs to be made, the instructions very clearly state the product will need to be in the same package. That would\u2019ve been murder for me but luckily\u2026 I like the desk enough I keep it. The leg that connects to the drawer has a small ding. I put this in the back to hide the imperfection. The holes on the left side that connect the desk top to the shelf are not lined up properly so I did end up not using one of the screws. However, this did not compromise its sturdiness because there are three legs and a cross bar. One of the bottom panels for the drawer didn\u2019t line up perfectly. I unscrewed the cam for the arm and found a way make it fit. It\u2019s going to take a while for the glides for the drawers to get used to being used also. It is particle board but the pre-drilled holes did their job minus some chipping.All-in-all, I absolutely love the look and feel of the new desk. The cons are the reason why I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 but thankfully there was a workaround and feel it\u2019s an appropriate rating.When I buy things I look for as close to perfection as I can get and I\u2019ve got no regrets! If any of this changes, whether good or bad, I\u2019ll be back to update my review.",
