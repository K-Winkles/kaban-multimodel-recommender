                "reviewText": "Before you even attempt to begin, get yourself a ratchet tool that holds bits like the orange one I pictured.When I first opened the package, I noticed that the desktop itself was a lot thinner than what I normally see. But having a metal tube frame may provide the support it needs. I normally put things together with minimal effort. This took hours. They provide you with all the tools you need but when you have to turn a 100 hex bolt screws in 1/4 turn at a time, it becomes laborious. The directions are good but it should emphasize which holes to look for to make sure it is properly aligned. It did that for some but not all and of course I had to get it wrong and had to undo couple of pieces.After all was said and done, the desk was a lot narrower than the customary 24\u201d. That 6\u201d depth makes a big difference. I put a writing pad on it and it made it look nicer but I have to say, that cloth like drawer really made the desk look extra cheap. It may work for a kids desk but for an adult, it needs some changes.",
