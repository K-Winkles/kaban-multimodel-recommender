I was able to do the majority of it on my own but I was grateful to have a second set of hands to occasionally hold things in place. It took just under two hours but I also took a couple of breaks and was not in a rush. I think you could do it in less. The space is great and surprisingly organized given the lack of drawers. I wish there was one more drawer on your left where they put the top shelf. I\u2019d say it was basically perfect if it had that. I\u2019ll find a basket to stick there and I\u2019ll be good to go. Hard to beat for the price. My husband calls is my command center. That\u2019s honestly fairly accurate.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely love the desk, and it wasnt too expensive. While easy to put together as far as screws and it comes with Allen wrench etc. It was easy to assemble but the directions did not explain which side is the top or the front etc.. so put it together 3x before the holes lined up. I wish it had stickers saying the is front/back top/bottom because you can easily out it together and find out 25 steps later that they were wrong direction so now you have to undo it all to get the holes to line up. Directions were not detailed enough. However I finally got it together and it looks great, as shown in photo and get lots of compliments on the desk. I would definitely buy it again, just be very very careful with directions. Read it but look at photo to try and see what side is showing.",

I ran into a tracking issue with FedEx and contacted the seller, they immediately reached out to me and FedEx to ensure I received the package and it was not lost (FedEx tracking stated on the way with no delivery date available after stating a delivery date as if it was lost on a truck). Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "After searching for a refurbished desk and not finding anything I liked, I decided to order this beauty. It was \u201cdelivered\u201d by FedEx. They said it was delivered on August 7 however it wasn\u2019t at either door nor surrounding apartment buildings. So, I contacted FedEx, they said they would contact that currier and have it delivered to the proper (initial) address, they never called with an update and when I called did not have an update. I decided to message the seller on the Amazon app and they always responded within the hour. They provided more information about FedEx than FedEx provided. They were considerate, timely, and sent me out a desk no questions asked. When the second desk was \u201cdelivered\u201d FedEx still managed to drop it at the incorrect door but thankfully that tenant was nice enough to come tell us and help us bring it upstairs to our unit. Disappointed in FedEx, so incredibly pleased with the seller and their due diligence in alleviating this once annoying situation.It took my fianc\u00e9 and I an hour and a half to assemble, great directions and extra buts and bolts which is always nice. The only confusing part was assembling the drawer but even that was somewhat self explanatory considering it\u2019s the final step. I would definitely recommend this desk and the seller anytime! The desk is sturdy, sleek and just what I envisioned in my home office.",
