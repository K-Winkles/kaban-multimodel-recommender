The instructions weren\u2019t too bad . The only problem is I broke the drawer sliders (will message seller for replacements). Otherwise this desk is very solid I love that the desk itself has its own outlets as well as a ton of storage underneath and drawer. I use a 27 inch monitor (vertical) and a 34 extra wide curved monitor with a laptop and I still have a ton of space. Even when I rock the desk the foundation is sturdy. I recommend EVERYONE who has the space to buy this desk.",

                "reviewText": "My children absolutely love it. Super spacious for the kids to do their homework on, while still having space to put their Legos on for decoration. It's also big enough to put a PC or any laptop while still having space for you to do work on. It even comes with built in light. My children love it especially comparing to the previous table I bought it was never big enough. I was worried about assembling it considering the size of it, but it was unnecessary very easy to assemble. Would definitely reccomend if you have alot kids that need a space to do work on or if you need a office desk that is spacious enough to put all ur papers and electronics on!",

This desk satisfied those needs at a price I can live with. I needed to upgrade from a smaller L-shaped desk to one that could accommodate two workstations. This desk is very functional. The desktop outlets shelves drawer are great feature. Setup was very simple with two people. Wonderful desk for the price and would highly recommend!",

The instructions are well done and the recommendation of an electric screwdriver is seconded (specifically for the drawer sides and slides).I did have one damaged component. I contacted WASAGUN customer service via email listed in the instructions. After a few pictures and discussion, they offered to send a NEW desk in order to provide the replacement. I was extremely pleased with their willingness to provide a high level of customer service. I actually plan to take part of the second desk and make a couch table out of it.",
