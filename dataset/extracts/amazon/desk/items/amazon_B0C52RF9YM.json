Almost none are symmetrical, and you need to align holes carefully.It\u2019s wood and what feels like powder coated steel. While the holes are mostly well-aligned, there is some \u201cplay\u201d and you may need to push on the metal to encourage it to bend into tighter alignment at times. Don\u2019t tighten all the screws! Leave them looser to get the pieces to fit, and then tighten.Last, we the instructions say to mount the RGB bars at the front of the monitor shelf. We mounted them at the back and I\u2019d recommend it. 1. There is more room in the back to spread out out the 2 light bars without bumping into the shelf supports. 2. The light is less in your face and gives the desk a nice glow. 3. They left two much slack between the the two RGB bars. Mounting in the front would leave an awkward loop of cable.",

Usually, they give only exactly what you need for screws, etc., but this came with extra parts so that there weren't any problems. The boards were a little thinner than expected but good enough. Overall I'm happy with the product",

                "reviewText": "Assembling took me about 2-3 hours to do and some parts were quite challenging to do by myself (needed someone to hold certain parts while screwing things in, but I just used my feet to hold it in place instead) so I recommend having someone there to help you build it as it would be much more convenient.The desk itself is nice and sturdy and the LED strip (many different colors as well as different tempo can be selected) adds a nice touch for night time gaming. The pillars/stands of the desk are made from metal and the tabletop portion of it is all wood. One cool thing about this desk is you can choose which sides you want the shelf on. Really love the charging outlet that is installed inside of the desk as well.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, the desk looks much higher quality in the online photos than in real life. Both the desktop shelf and the main desk are not single pieces of wood, but rather a panel of boards you attach together. They are not flush, and there is an especially prominent gap in the center of the desktop shelf that I will have to stare at every time I work at the desk. The pieces to attach the LED lights came broken, so I\u2019ll have to find a way to attach besides as instructed. I won\u2019t likely return because it was so intensive putting together and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to take apart/repackage. It does seem sturdy and functional in that regard, but really disappointed with the aeathetics.",
