The desktop is very roomy. It holds a laptop and two 27 inch monitors and a separate keyboard. There is room for papers, a phone and my breakfast! It's heavy so it's not moving around when I lean on it. There is a lot of leg room. I'm very pleased with this.",

                "reviewText": "I love this desk! It's the perfect size for my arts and crafts! And very stable when all the screws are tightened and the feet are lvl! The white top is easy to clean with a few swipes. That being said, since I've had the desk for over a year I have noticed that the screws come loose rather often and they need to be regularly tightened. It's not much of a problem and it's something I expected since the desk is moved around multiple times a day. I don't have a craft room so the desk sits in the living room and I move it forwards and back to get in and out of a recliner chair. Ill even move it to different rooms, as needed. That moving is probably what causes the issues with the screws. I suggest a different desk if you intend to move it often like I do. Yesterday I also noticed that the rubber piece that allows the screw to thred into the leg, snapped in half and it's become a bit rickety now without the plastic holding the foot still. The little plastic piece looks like it wouldn't do much but now the table is incredibly wobbly no matter how much I adjust the feet. So it may be retired to a bedroom soon. But even with those issues, it's the perfect lightweight desk for me and I will definitely be purchasing this again, and soon.",

                "reviewText": "Much sturdier than I would have expected, and without the awkward supports between the legs that many similar tables have that would reduce flexibility. The foot adjustment eliminates the need for the traditional wedge or matchbook and keeps it from wobbling even on uneven floors. Definitely not something you would want to disassemble and reassemble frequently, but once it is assembled it is solid. Ideal size for a desk, work table or even dining table for one in a cramped space. I set it up as a crafting table for a senior in a small room. It is just barely big enough for two people to work on the same project while facing each other on opposite sides.",
