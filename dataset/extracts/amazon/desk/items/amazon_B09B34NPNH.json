The only minor complaint I have is that the low back boards of the 2 upper shelves, have the same color of the wood shelves only on 2 sides, which means that one side of it will be the black laquer coloring. Aside from that, it's a great set of shelves with 6 threaded feet. It may also be worth it to get the sticky felt pads for the bottom of the feet so as to prevent risk of any floor scraping.",
