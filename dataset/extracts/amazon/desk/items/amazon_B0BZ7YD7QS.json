                "reviewText": "This desk came packed really nice. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.It's put together using the tool that is included. All the pieces are separated and clearly marked and include a couple of extras.I think it took me less than 30 minutes from picking it up off the porch to sitting in front it in my chair.It is absolutely beautiful. I've had it for a while now and use it every day. The electric sockets and charging ports on the top are really convenient. They are probably my favorite feature.The shelves and the file folder pocket being able to go on either side was what sold me on this desk to begin with as I wasn't sure where to place it until after I got it.The shelves are very sturdy and hold plenty of weight. The file pocket seems to be unfillable. It's really enormous.Once it's put together the seam between the shelves and the desktop is unnoticeable. It's very smooth. You can move the desk around a lot and that seam never shows up.It comes with braces to make it super sturdy so it doesn't wiggle at all.Suggestion: when you put it together pay attention to the pattern of the surfaces. They are slightly different on each side. Once I had mine together I ended up taking one shelf off and turning it over because the other side looked better.Just a quick swipe with a damp cloth and it looks like new again as well. I really couldn't be happier.And it's also a perfect match with the shelves I bought!Get this desk! It's a great deal for the money!!",

                "reviewText": "Fairly easy to assemble, I'm an 84 yr old female, one of the components are particularly heavy, the 2 critical moments, flipping the frame over to attach to the top, flipping the entire desk back upright. This is not as sturdy as some have claimed in their reviews but good enough for the price. Be careful not to over tighten the bolts, it's hollow metal frame and will dent. The specific purpose is to hold a Babylock Triumph serger that weight 28 lbs and in use has a lot of vibration/action. I will try to update the review once I've worked with the serger if anyone cares. This fit a tight space on a wall that already holds a large sewing desk with an even heavier machine. The narrow shelves are adequate and freed up more useful shelf space, the hanging bag is also quite sturdy and now has all the manuals for this machine, another plus. It's a clean look.",

It was wonderful. My daughter loves her new desk and the additional storage it offers. It took me maybe 30 minutes to assemble, part of which was the small space in which I was attempting to assemble it. I had to continuously shift the desk around and move parts out of the hallway into the room due tot he small area I had. If I had ample space, I feel confident this would have taken maybe 20 minutes to assemble.",
