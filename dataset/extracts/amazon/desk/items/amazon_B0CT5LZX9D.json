He needed to be able to stand off and on while in the office and wanted something that would work for having both his laptop and extra keyboard and mouse on it.This does the job. So far he loves it. Plenty large enough for his needs without being too big.It's only been in use a few days but seems to be working, going up and down, with ease.His only comment was that when it was down and he was working seated, the edge was sharp on the wrist.He added a blotter to it that comes close to the edge and seems to help with the problem.Great quality for the price.",
