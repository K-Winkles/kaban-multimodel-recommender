                "reviewText": "Bought this Desk because I really liked the structure/layout/drawer. Some of these reviews had me hesitant, but I'm glad I bought anyway. Assembly is DEFINITELY a bit time consuming, but I didn't encounter some of the nightmares people have noted. Each piece comes with a sticker that has a number on it that matches the provided instructions. A couple numbers fell off during unpacking, but overall if you can assemble ikea furniture, you should be able to handle this. One of the legs came with a small dent in it, but this didn't hinder/impede overall assembly. Once I had to undo some screws because I had a piece the wrong way / holes not aligned, but was able to correct it. At the end I had a bit of trouble connecting the left side and main side of the top wood panels. I do agree and recommend not to tighten everything until you're sure it's all aligned (I couldn't get a screw in the hole until I loosened some screws from earlier steps). If you have a partner to help assemble, that would probably help. I did it solo and got it done in about 4hours.For the price, you can't really complain about assembly. Once put together, this Desk is amazing compared to the other options that run $500+. Only last note is that where the \"L\" portion of the wood panels meet, it's not 100% seamless for me. There's a noticeable 5cm dip from where the main wood top meets the left side wood top, but this hasn't affected my work or rating. If you want something to go flat exactly on the spot where the two panels meet to make the \"L\" shape, this might be an issue for you. Drawer is great, smooth rolling, and I like that it accommodates multiple paper sizes. Color matches photos, everything is very sturdy / not wobly. I use a 34in ultrawide, and while the base is a bit cozy, it fits well on the elevated shelf.",

                "reviewText": "Love this desk! Beautiful finish, looks and works great, and it's holding up very well after a few months' daily use. It's so much easier now to keep everything where I needed it with this desk in my home office. The matching organizer is a nice touch and really handy. Very pleased overall.There are a lot of parts to this desk, which means a lot of steps to assemble, but I was blown away by the planning and craftsmanship. So often, when you have to assemble a product yourself, you get terrible half-baked instructions and then discover that it's poorly designed, run into issues where things don't quite align correctly and you have to struggle to get everything to fit together properly, or there are missing/broken/poor quality parts, or you have to drill your own holes for some of the screws because somebody neglected to do so, or you can't figure out which parts are which because they're not properly labeled. This desk had none of those problems. Everything aligned PERFECTLY, and came together really smoothly. As I mentioned, there are a lot of parts, but they're all clearly labeled and packaged in such a way that it's easy to keep everything organized as you put it together. Instructions are detailed and easy to understand. Someone clearly put a lot of careful thought into making the assembly a breeze. For the first couple of steps, maybe 5-10 minutes, I enlisted hubby for an extra set of hands to hold a few parts in place while I attached them. After that, I put the rest together myself. When it was all done, nothing wobbled or jiggled. It feels nice and solid. Impressive!The solid design and smooth assembly process have me convinced that this desk is going to last me a good long time. An excellent purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I think this desk is amazing. I definitely think it\u2019s worth the price (even though it could be a little cheaper) but at my local stores, l-shaped desks are far more expensive. I got mine in black. I feel that it\u2019s very sturdy but I guess that was depend on how tight you screw in everything\u2026 Anyways, some holes were a little bit unaligned which is upsetting because I had to figure out how to make it work and I\u2019m not one who as access to other tools like a drill. What I did was is (and it\u2019s hard to explain but if you get it, cool) I had to screw one hole in then forcefully push it in at an angle to make it work if that makes sense. There was also this one part of the desk (desk part that does have the monitor stand on it) was unleveled. At first, I thought I had done something wrong so I took apart that part of the desk and redid it but I was doing everything right. It was just unleveled. I just wedged in a mini stack of mini sticky notes to keep it leveled and it worked! It\u2019s definitely noticeable though so if you have this problem, use sticky notes close to the color of the desk or anything else that is close or is the color but only if you care enough to actually do so.Out of the box, most of everything in it is numbered or some lettered off according the materials list in the booklet. Except some stickers fell off and were out of place throughout the box. Idk if this is because the stickers weren\u2019t sticky enough or because of shipping unsure. Speaking of the booklet, I really like the step by step picture instructions, it\u2019s very helpful in my opinion. I wish they would highlight the holes more because the pictures are big but it\u2019s like they make the holes really small and difficult to see but I managed. It also comes with mini tools which is great but I personally think it would be better if you get your own tools that are regular sized because if might get frustrating.On the desk itself, it has this whole to put your cords through which is another great thing. I just wish that maybe they couldn\u2019t have added another on the opposite side from that one. I really love the printer stand! I was kind of iffy about it at first because I thought my printer was quite large and stupid enough I didn\u2019t pay attention to the measurements of the printer stand part but I\u2019m glad that my printer ended up fitting perfecting. I also wish that they had an option for more drawers instead of the one filing drawer. I mean you don\u2019t have to use it as a filing drawer and could be repurposed for something else but that\u2019s just my thought.Monitor stand: I LOVE IT. I don\u2019t own monitors but I put my MacBook on it and use a mech keyboard because I read somewhere it promotes a better back/neck instead of having to look down at your screen.I was reading other peoples\u2019 review and read how most of them took 1.5-3hrs to set up\u2026 that was not the case for me. Me and my younger sister did it ourselves and we are small. I\u2019m not lying when I say this took over 8 hours+ to assemble with mini breaks in between and the frustrations from unaligned holes and unleveled part. When you finish assembling it, I\u2019m sure y\u2019all would be happy because it is a beautiful and big desk. Honestly, for me, it was a workout haha",
