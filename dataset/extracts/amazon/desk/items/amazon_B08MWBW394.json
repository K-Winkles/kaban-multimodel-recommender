                "reviewText": "This was my first time purchasing a computer desk online. I was hesitant at first to make a big purchase. Desks and chairs are items I like to view in the store before I buy. Since I was unable to do so, all I have are the opinions of other reviewers who make online purchases. Well, I can vouch for the 5-star reviewers when they say this desk meets and exceeds expectations.It wasn't too challenging to put together. A little time-consuming, but it's worth it. I found it therapeutic. I took my time and didn't rush. I didn't need any power tools or to tweak anything to make parts fit. The tools it came with did the job just fine. There were no scratches or chips in the wood. It's pretty solid and made of great quality.Once put together in its entirety, it looked amazing and was a perfect fit in my room! I am truly surprised at the sturdiness. Also, the desk drawer slides smoothly in and out with no problem. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffdTHIS IS REALLY A GREAT QUALITY DESK AT A GREAT PRICE!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

I have three monitors on the upper shelf and plenty of room for my notebooks, etc on the main platform. There is ZERO wobbling and the laminate \"wood\" looks realistic and still looks as new as the day I put this desk together. Get this desk - you won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this desk for my son\u2019s birthday, and he\u2019s very happy with it, which makes ME happy.To begin, the desk was securely packaged - probably the best packaging I\u2019ve seen yet. It arrived in pristine condition.Each piece was numbered, and each package of screws or bolts had one extra. It also came with an Allen wrench and thin regular wrench, which was all I needed to put the desk together, although I also used my drill.The directions were clear and easy for me to follow, which is priceless. I made one mistake by not paying attention to the diagram which showed the bolt holes, but that was easily fixed. I put the desk together in the recommended order, as it made sense and was a smooth process.The drawer was also easy to put together, which was a pleasant surprise. It slides in and out smoothly.The desk feels very solid. There is zero wobbling, and the leg height can be adjusted, probably 1/2 an inch, if needed.The monitor ledge is just the right height and width.All in all, I\u2019m very happy I chose this desk. I like it enough that I\u2019m thinking about getting another one for use with my sewing machine, it\u2019s so sturdy.I highly recommend this desk.",

                "reviewText": "The instruction was straightforward. The whole setup took over 2 hours of screwing the pieces together, you may need another person to help place the main shelf on top of the stands. I only needed the hex wrench as the open-ended wrench was unnecessary.Despite the obvious care in packaging the pieces, I did have a few issues such as one of my wooden shelves being damaged, the metal shelf being dented, and I am missing two of the A screws. The metal shelf, it's not obvious in the picture, but I bought this in new condition and I can see it, so it does bother me. There was also I think plastic shaving, maybe acrylic that some use to waterproof, on the wooden parts that I had to get damp napkins to clean. My skin did not like it as red splotches appear wherever the shaving landed. I opened up a door and aired it out while unpacking and cleaning.I contacted customer service about the damaged pieces and missing screws and their response was very quick, most time within the next couple of hours. I was mildly miffed that they only addressed the wooden board and extra nails. They completely ignored the metal part in their response. Then I had to wait about two weeks for the extra part and replacement shelf to come. When I did receive the shelf it was thoroughly packaged to prevent any damage, which I was thankful for. For the extra nails, it was too excessive; they basically sent me a second nails packet, I already had a few leftover nails for the previous pack and now I have too many taking up space, so be aware of that.The desk looks amazing after being put together and is very spacious for my small room. I like the simple design and functionality as I originally bought this for work. The piece is extremely sturdy and I have no problem piling on my laptop, monitors, tower, speakers, etc. with spaces to spare. I have badly finished tile flooring, so some places are not even and the adjustable feet were just what I needed to keep everything level. I did find the bottom for the drawer flimsy, so at most, it will be for light miscellaneous items like paper or pens - nothing more.",
