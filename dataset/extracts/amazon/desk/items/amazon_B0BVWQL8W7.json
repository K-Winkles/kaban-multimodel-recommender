The cabinet door needs adjusting but it\u2019s designed for that. Drawer rolls smoothly. I\u2019m right-handed, needed laptop to sit towards the left so I can write on papers on the right. So having the drawer and cabinet on the right allowed this.Assembly was challenging, pieces looked similar and were not numbered even though instructions showed this. Some holes were not pre-drilled. Wooden dowels that helped keep items together pushed too far into one piece (holes should\u2019ve been drilled halfway). But final project is great. The instructions gave an \u201cactual size\u201d drawing of hardware so easy to match and find the correct size screws. Desk is very sturdy and plumb/level. I\u2019d recommend it for small spaces.",

It has 3 drawers and 1 larger storage on the left side, which meets what I need.Even the package included a very clear instruction with QR code that you can scan and follow the video instructions, however, I only found 2 boards that marked the number and I needed to measure all other boards and mark the numbers myself, this is the only thing I'm not appreciated, other than that is good. And I was able to assemble it myself without my husband's help at all.And I do like some other small things, such as they provided the small plastic cover to cover the screws to make the desk looks nice.",
