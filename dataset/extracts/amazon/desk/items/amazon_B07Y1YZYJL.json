                "reviewText": "Shipping and packing: It comes in 2 packages. Amazon provided the tracking number of the table top. Mine arrived together, but for my colleague it arrived separately - it depends on how fedex ships these parcels. It was shipped promptly from CA, but took 9 days to arrive at MA. Desktop is 33 lb, while the frame is 50lb. It was very well packaged and despite the scuffs and dings on the package everything inside was good.Assembling: It is quite heavy. While I was able to do this myself, it would be good to have help. Packages are also quite heavy. Instruction booklet was clear, but take your time to read and review carefully. It took about 2 hrs total to assemble. I suspect for the second table it would be just 20 min. Fasteners look good quality and allen wrench and spanners are provided. To attach the control box you will need to drill 2 holes, and and wish the holes for this was predrilled. You could probably use double sided tape to attach to the bottom of the table, since it is very light. The others holes for screws to attach with the frame and buttons are all predrilled. After assembly, I used sliders to move it easily over carpet.Looks: I ordered the white frame with maple top. Frame looks very sturdy. Frame is slightly off white and looks very elegant with table top. Table top seems to be of good quality with rounded edges and quite sturdy. Both top and bottom have a good quality veneer. The frame has leveling screws at all 4 corners.Performance: Table top moves up and down quite smoothly with very little sound. Memory button is quite useful to set positions. Lowest height shows 28\", but is actually 29\" to the top of table. This seems just fine for me. Upper height is at 49\". That's too high for me and I've set it at 40\". It holds two 24\" monitors and a laptop and goes up and down with no problems.I've been using for a few days now, and its very good to be able to stand and work for part of the day. I'm more active and move around during that time. Over time I hope to be able to stand for longer hours. I really should have bought this years ago.",

                "reviewText": "I love this desk so far. It is very spacious and the touchpad is easy to use. It is very heavy and sturdy so I'm pretty confident it will never tip over, and it can definitely hold all of my stuff. The white looks so smooth and clean and feels very modern. I was able to fit my Flexispot filing cabinet under the desk and there is still plenty of room for my legs when I am sitting at the desk. It raises quite high. I am kind of short so it goes way higher than I will ever need it. I saw a lot of people saying it was confusing to build. There really aren't that many parts, so just look closely at the instructions and you will be fine. The only thing is that these desks are mix n match with the tabletops so sometimes there will be multiple drill holes on the underside of the desk top depending on which desk frame you got, you will have to figure out which holes you are supposed to use. But I had no trouble putting it together, it is very heavy though so you may need an extra hand to lift it/flip it over. That just shows it's made with high quality materials and is made well! Very happy with this desk!",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I am happy with my desk! I have the 55 x 28 maple top with white legs. It's a great size if you have multiple monitors or just like a little more elbow room on your desk. I work from home and I'm still in school, so it's a great price point for me and has made my procrastination and back/knee pain decrease substantially lol (your hamstrings will thank you). While it is a bit too high for me at the lowest setting - about 29 inches - I don't mind it too much since I have a dog and he loves to lay under it while I work.The table top is nice and sturdy. Not too thin and not too thick. Perfect for most clamp-on monitor arms and other clamp-on accessories. While my dream desk is an oak Ergonofis, this is the best thing I could find that met my needs and had a similar aesthetic. Hope this was helpful! Will add updates in a few months once I'm settled into my next place and see if I'm still happy with it then.PROS:- ROUNDED CORNERS Y'ALL!- more than enough size for laptop + monitor + nintendo switch dock + keyboard + mouse + plants/decor- great quality for the price- nice and heavy so it feels like a quality product- easy assembly (just read the instructions people)- quick ship time- plenty of size and wood options- can always switch out legs or table top if desiredCONS:- table is still too tall for me (5'2)- it weights over 100 lbs all together so don't try to lift the whole thing by yourself if it's bigger than 40 inches. You WILL need one other person to help with set up and moving it around.- wish the stand reminders were standard on all desks with preset options.",

Smooth, quiet operation and relatively easy to setup. It was also delivered a few days earlier than expected which was a plus! Overall, incredible value and really happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Putting things together takes a bit of time, not to mention needing to flip the table once constructed. Motor and rod can be a bit hidden rather than exposed. Similarly cables (controller to motor, power socket cable to motor) are just badly exposed, could do with a bit of covering. Structurally very solid, no wobbly going up or down, able to hold heavy objects. Safety stop detection works well, it will stop at impact. Controller memorise settings well, very handy to use any presets. Very satisfied",
