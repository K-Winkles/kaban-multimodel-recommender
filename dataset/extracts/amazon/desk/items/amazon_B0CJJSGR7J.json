                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Bestier L Shaped Gaming Desk with Shelves, and I'm absolutely loving it! Here are some of my thoughts on this desk:Pros:The desk is incredibly spacious, giving me plenty of room to work and play games without feeling cramped.The L-shaped design is great for multitasking, as I can easily switch between my computer and paperwork without having to get up and move around.The shelves on the side of the desk are a fantastic addition, providing extra storage space for all of my gaming accessories and other items.The desk is sturdy and well-made, with a solid construction that feels like it will last for years.Cons:Assembly can be a bit tricky, especially if you're not used to putting together furniture. However, the instructions are clear and easy to follow, so it's not too difficult.There are no drawers with this desk setup, so you might want to look into purchasing some drawers as well. I ended up getting two sets of 6 drawers on casters from Ikea to work with this desk setup. I also purchased two of these. One I made into a full straight desk, and the other one I made into an L shape.I highly recommend the Bestier L Shaped Gaming Desk with Shelves. It's a fantastic desk for gamers and anyone who needs plenty of workspace, and the added shelves are a great bonus. The desk is well-made and sturdy, and I expect it will last me for years to come.Ohh! And the carbon fiber looks amazing!",

You\u2019ll have a few pieces left over depending on what you choose. It\u2019s light weight so easy to move but sturdy enough to hold books and school supplies. The additional space gives room for a laptop and monitor and we still have room to spread out papers and books for reading and studying.

                "reviewText": "I don't give many 5 star reviews and to be honest, I really wasn't expecting much from this desk. It was packaged ok and I did notice what looks like some weird imperfections that looked like white streaks or rub marks on on of the desk tops but it kind of just blended in to the color.Set up was super easy. Some reviewers are talking about a 4 hour assembly time?!? Maybe I was fortunate and got a good one but this desk was completed in maybe 30 minutes. Maybe some reviewers were cranking on the screws too hard but this was super easy and self explanatory. On thing I will say that at least one reviewer is wrong about is that you CAN NOT have the straight version AND have the shelves on the left hand side. Not unless you redo the desktop holes and strengthen the new merging piece locations. I modified mine and utilized the bar and some L metal clips screwed into the legs to have one long shelf on the left side. I am using a triple monitor set up with my main 32\" and it is plenty sturdy. My only issue with my set up is that my right hand speaker is stuck behind the right monitor but that is not the fault of the desk. It looks amazing, it's sturdy and it's one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit worried about getting this desk since there were a few bad reviews that involved damaged parts and poor construction on materials. However, I want to share my experience with receiving and assembling the desk. The box arrived and the box was a little banged up but of course with cardboard and the whole thing weighing 70+ lbs that is to be expected. The pieces were packed in nicely and had protective pieces and foam on corners and between sections to assure that nothing would be damaged. Every piece was labeled and marked. The screws and small pieces were also all individually bagged and marked with a letter to help identify which part you needed to use. They also included a spare parts bag but I did not need to use these. The instructions were clear and as long as you follow the instructions and use the correct pieces where it says than you should be good, you have to make sure you see how the part is oriented and as long as you do that you should have no problem. It was nice they included a screwdriver, but it was so short that grabbed my own since it was difficult to get enough torque to tighten some screws with the small driver. I really recommend this desk. It is super sturdy and I like the depth and height. When I was searching for desks online, some had depths of around 18 inches, and I was trying to find one a bit longer and this one at 22 inches is nice and leaves a good amount of space.Also it arrived very quickly. When I ordered it it said it would take about 2 weeks but I got it 5 days.",

One rail facing the wrong direction will have you doing more taking apart than putting together. But once you get it\u2026the desk is amazing and ver spacious.
