                "reviewText": "I was a bit intimidated by the assembly based off of customer reviews, so I let it sit in the box for a few days waiting to tackle it. I don\u2019t own power tools or have the skills needed to do major projects, but this wasn\u2019t bad at all. Either I got a good batch, the problem with the holes not aligning is resolved, or the installation video did the trick. Not sure. I will say that it\u2019s important to watch the video. It slightly conflicts with the paper instructions, so follow the video. Only tighten the legs halfway when you first put them on and make sure those gray plastic circular things with the x\u2019s on them are facing in the right direction. Do this and you\u2019ll be fine. The piece under the desk that everyone complains limits leg room is annoying. But likely only will pose a problem for taller people. It\u2019s a beautiful desk for sure.**Update**After using it with a newly purchased chair I can report that my legs definitely hit the weird piece of wood that juts out underneath the desk. I placed the desk on mini risers and removed the chair footing. It has helped a bit. It\u2019s not enough to make me regret purchasing it, but it\u2019s definitely an annoyance.",

I love the pull out cabinet, open shelf cabinet, and the grommet for cords. Everything just makes sense. Also the \u201cpaint\u201d seems waterproof too\u2014i spilled and had water on it, but nothing happened (the water doesn\u2019t absorb). Also I really love this color scheme. It was simple to assemble\u2014just follow the guide to a \u201ct\u201d.",

                "reviewText": "Desk took almost two hours to assemble because pieces came incomplete.1. Rather than two unique pieces to create the drawer, I received a duplicate of piece 4 instead of 1 piece 3 and 1 piece 4. See second photo where I needed to modify the piece in order to function properly as a drawer inset - as a result, I was unable to attach the backboard.2. On the front of the black drawer, one screw insert was missing the plastic round, which meant I was only unable to attach the drawer screws in 3/4 sections.",
