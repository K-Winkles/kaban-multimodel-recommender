We are both really impressed with the quality of the metal legs and how high they actually go.Assembly had some minor struggle, but only because I had finished surgical recovery and was still sore. It wasn't difficult, persay, bit did take about an hour or so. Only minor complaint is that the \"drawer\" is a bit snug, but I understand that it's designed to be like that so it says in shape. I'm not a big fan of \"planks\" - the top comes in two slabs, one in front, and another in back; I understand this is for ease of shipping, and it's an acceptable compromise.Would definitely recommend if in the market- one of the best prices for the size and quality.",
