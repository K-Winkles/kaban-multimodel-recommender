The assembly was a breeze, all the parts were labeled and numbered, and the finished product was very sturdy and good looking.I needed a desk like this for gaming and study while also fitting in the limited space I had.The carbon fiber is very well done as well, I like the feel. Leds are very bright and easy tocontrol with the app. Overall, I would give this desk 5/5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my son for Christmas. Putting it together didn't take longer than an hour and it's STURDY! It's already been over a month and there have been zero issues. Everything fit and lined up perfectly! He also loved the addition of the LED lights and the extra outlets connected to the desk. Cupholder holds drinks perfectly and doesn't bend under the weight of his glass cups. He has every PlayStation console and there's room to store all of them on this desk. Along with two big-sized monitors, games, a Wii and an Xbox! I'm so impressed with how many places you can store things without it being over crowded. Overall, this is a 10/10. Absolutely recommend if you're looking for a gaming desk!!",

Also a lot to the desk is optional (cup holder, headset hanger, monitor stands, power strip)A con that\u2019s yet to affect me is the power strip, the power strip feels and looks very cheap. I wouldn\u2019t put a ton of trust into it if you want to run everything off that. I\u2019ll probably end up swapping it out myself later on with a quality named one. A bit pricier than others, but great desk!",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, the quality of items on Amazon has plummeted in recent years, so buying anything on here is always a roulette. I decided to gamble and am so incredibly glad I did. Not only did I assemble this thing by myself in under an hour, but the instructions are clear and concise and the desk itself is SOLID. It was shipped in amazing packing with bumpers on the corners of the main part of the desk. And dense foam inserts buffering it on all sides. No hardware was missing and it even came with a full sized screw driver! It went together so easily that i found myself questioning if i was doing something wrong. It\u2019s light weight but offers an impressive amount of space. The monitor shelves are at the perfect height and are wide enough for most monitor stands. There were no issues with holes mismatching and once it was together it was sturdy and easy enough to move by myself. 10/10 on this desk. Well worth every cent. If you\u2019re a gamer in need of an upgrade, start here.",
