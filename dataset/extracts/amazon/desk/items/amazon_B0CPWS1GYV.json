I do recommend to use a bigger screwdriver than the one it comes in with it you have one to avoid hand cramping! Overall it was an easy process and I am happy with the purchase.

                "reviewText": "After looking at a standing desk for a long time and having this model on my wishlist for some time, I bought it. The instructions were ok but at least one of the pictures mirrored. Once together it is fairly sturdy, and goes smoothly up and down. I also like that there are three memory settings and they work flawless.My only concern is that the table top consists of two parts, held together by the end pieces and some metal pieces at 4 points. There is a noticable line across the table where the two pieces meet and it flexes when you're leaning on the table. Time will tell if it will be an issue.Other then that the legs are heavy and solid, the motor moves the desk up and down without issue, and I am pretty happy with it.",

The instructions were clear and had pictures for visual learners which was really helpful.The legs/ stand portion of the desk are heavy, durable, and create. Stable desk but the two pieces that create the desk top are not the highest quality. In fact, there is a slight dent right in the center of the desktop. It wouldn\u2019t be worth it to disassemble and return. It\u2019s a small enough dent that isn\u2019t paint chipped so I can live with it.It adjusts just like it is advertised. I also purchased a walking treadmill for underneath standing desks, so this is a perfect match for that product.",

                "reviewText": "Didn't take long to assemble. Set up was easy. 3 modes you can set to specific heights. The motor isn't loud. Doesn't shake or wobble. The lowest height you can get is 73.0 (inches). The under desk headset holder is closer to the middle of the side edges, but very convenient for other cables/etc if you don't have to rush to pick up the phone asap. The desk itself is split in half length-wise for ease of shipping/packaging, and I have not noticed the split at all. It's super seamless, smooth.Also, the 73.0 inch base desk setting fits well for a gaming chair, specifically the Secretlab one. I don't find the trouble of the desk being too high for my gaming chair when I want to sit down. (I have the medium/regular-sized Secretlab chair, not the XL one or small one.) 77.0 inches is the perfect desk height for the Secretlab chair to slide under the lowest setting with the chair dropped all the way down and the armrests raised by 2 notches.",

                "reviewText": "Item arrived with minor damage to one of the top boards in a few places along the middle edge. It's not bad, but disappointing. Item is very easy to install The unit goes up and down with ease. It is not the most stable desk and tends to move back and forth pretty easily. Just be cautious of what you put on it. (ie: don't put drinks on the unit). But, for what I need it for, it works fine.If you plan to put a keyboard tray on the bottom, you will need to build out the bottom so the tray has something to attach to because all the mechanical components for the riser are otherwise in the way. I did this in 3 steps because the desktop itself is only 5/8\" thick so you don't have much to work with on the first piece of plywood. In my case, I stacked 2 pieces of 3/4\" plywood and 1 piece of 1/4\" plywood in front and behind the bars to give room for the keyboard tray. If you leave the keyboard on the desktop, you will have no issues.",

The frame is sturdy and was easy to assemble. No problems with alignment of holes which some have complained about. Only time will tell if the electrical will hold out and I will update my review after a few months. There was one hole in the package where the was nothing solid inside so there was no damage to the product. The top is a bit flimsy, laminate over particle board, but quality I expected for the price.I wish there was a way to switch the side the controls are on, it would work better for my set up and I will have to decide if I want to drill new holes for that.",
