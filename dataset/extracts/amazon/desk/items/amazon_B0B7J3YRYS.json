                "reviewText": "I work from home and have wanted a standing desk with a built-in stand for a long time, and so far I've really enjoyed this one. I especially love the two drawers, side hooks, and cable organization in the back, which sold me on the desk to start. As someone who hates a cluttered desk, these features are a dream. I got the 55\"x28\" and it's the perfect size, since 24\" desks have always felt too shallow to me. The motor is smooth and quiet and the pre-set options are nice to have. The desk looks nice and feels solid, though I will say that it's actually not too heavy and can be moved around with a bit of muscle. The directions were extremely easy to follow--I built it on my own in about 4 hours. Make sure you have a philips screwdriver and an electric screwdriver on hand, and a drill just in case (see below).I only have a few complaints so far:- I was missing 3 important screws. Luckily the manufacturer sends a little baggie of extras so I was able to pull 1 from there and use the 2 screws from one of the hooks, but now I don't have a second hook.- One of the wood boards didn't have pre-drilled holes. I thought I was losing my mind at one point trying to figure out how to put together one of the pieces before realizing the manufacturer hadn't drilled the two holes I needed to build it. Luckily I have a drill on hand, but this could be a major issue for some.- The height on the adjustable switch is in centimeters, not inches. This isn't really a problem, more confusing to my imperial system-trained brain. The desk's lowest setting is at 72cm (or 28in), and adjusts up from there.I've only had this desk a few days and will update this review if needed. So far, though, it's been great!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Had this for a little over a week now and honestly it is amazing so far.Dimensions:The table top is deeper and more spacious than it even appeard to be in the images, which is great and feels less cramped than most desks I've used in the past. I purchased the 55\" width table, which is pretty wide, but is honestly a comfortable size if you are looking to have many things residing on your table, without feeling like you're running out of space. But I am not sure how the 48\" version would feel.Adjustable Height:The height adjuster is also working smoothly. I was hesitant about this feature at first, especially because this desk is more affordable compared to most tables that elevate to different heights. I felt it would be \"cheap\" or lack quality performance. But, so far so good. It goes high enough for a person who is tall (I am 6'4\") to stand and work comfortably). It reaches its full height from the lowest point in under a minute.Assembly:Regarding the assembly, please note you will need a screw driver or power drill, which are not included, to finish putting it together.I will be honest, it took me nearly 4 hours to put it together, and perhaps is one of the most complex things I've had to assemble. Why 4 hours? Well I took my time, which I feel is very important for a table like this, to make sure everything is in place. I especially found myself dealing extra cautiously with the tension rod that was to go into the sloth to allow the motor to elevate and lower the table. Fortunately the process was very smooth despite the length of time. All the bolts and screws fit in with such ease and that made the long process less arduous. The built quality is rather impressive too, everything was new and nealtly packaged into the box with very clear instructions. With that said, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars for ease of assembly, because its not difficult, but is very time intensive.Sturdiness:In terms of sturdiness, when the desk is elevated, it doesn't feel as secure raised as when it is at a lower elevation (making sure the 4 bolts are tight in each leg will help tremendously with this, but still it is less sturdy, so try not to lean as much when the table is elevated). I personally may not frequently use the desk at a very high elevation, so it's not a huge concern for me but something to be mindful of if you plan to use the desk in this way.Overall, I am very satisfied and it was worth the investment, especially because it was discounted at $269. Perhaps in a couple of months, God willing, I will provide an update to my review if anything changes or share how well this holds up over time.",

                "reviewText": "I just started a work from home job and needed a desk that would accommodate my dual monitor needs and not break the bank. I'm so glad I stumbled across this one. It is fantastic! The built in monitor risers are perfect for two monitors, and there's plenty of room for a third as well. The included drawers and shelf are perfect for extra storage and you still have almost 18\" depth of desk left for for your keyboard, mouse, and space to actaually write if need be. My previous desk and most of the other options I had been considering only offered 24\" depth total. With my monitor in place on my last desk, this barely left room to take notes and stretch since my keyboard took up most of the remaining space. Included instructions are pretty straight forward, though I did have to really think a bit harder when it came to assembling the drawer/riser portion. Please, pay attention when it comes to the top piece of the riser as I put it on backwards. It fits both ways, but the trim around the side edges comes together in the very center along the long side of the board in the back. I accidentally flipped it so it is on the front on mine. I'm sure my OCD will make me fix it eventually but it is hardly noticeable. The motor on the riser is smooth and barely makes any noise and the preset options make it super easy to switch between sitting and standing positions. One added benefit that I never considered is that sitting is so much more comfortable for me as a tall person. I am 6'4\" and I've always had to lower my chair all the way to be able to fit my legs under the standard desk height of 29 to 30\". This was fine for casual desk use, but became quite painful on my legs/knees while sitting for 8 hours straight. This desk allows me to adjust my regular sitting height so I can raise my chair up all the way, making for a much better sitting position for my long legs. I cannot recommend this desk enough. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. Added bonus is it's a great option for tall people like me.",
