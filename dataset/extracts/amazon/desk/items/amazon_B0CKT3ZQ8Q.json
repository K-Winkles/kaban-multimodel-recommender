                "reviewText": "This desk is really nice. It was easy to assemble, and the instructions are clear and uncomplicated. It did take me over an hour to complete assembly, but I also took my time doing so. The black and red has a nice gaming look, and I was able to put the shelf side on the right, instead of the left as pictured in the description. The instructions give you the assembly for whatever side is best suited for your needs. I decided to not make the other small shelf for a monitor attach permanently, as I do use laptops only, so I did not add that to the desk, but I do like that I can easily finish that step if I switch to a desktop computer. The outlet works, but it's not something I personally will use beyond the USB ports, but I do also like that I can use it for my laptop if I change my mind. This is a medium to large desk, depending on what you are used to, so I would definitely double check the space is accurate before ordering, as it almost did not fit where I needed it to go. I only considered the 19inch depth, and not the 30+inches the shelf side takes up. Fortunately, it did end up working for my space, especially being able to switch the side the shelf is on. It is pretty sturdy as well, and that's without adding one of the crisscross set of bars, as I wanted full access to the backside of the shelves, and left this off. All around this desk was a perfect addition to my home. I am very happy with it, and I love the red accent color with the black. I would order this again if this one ever broke. I may even order one in the future for my 8 yr old son, as he loved it and I've been considering getting him a computer setup for gaming. This would be perfect for that. All around a nice desk. I have zero complaints.",
