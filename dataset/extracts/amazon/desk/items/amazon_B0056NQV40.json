                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of these desks to turn a living room into an at-home office while working from home for the foreseeable future. The reasons for purchase were:1. Price - I wanted something cheap because I envision putting the desk into storage after I return to work2. Size - I needed something smaller and light-weight because I have limited space and need to be able to shift things around when my \"office\" transforms back into my living room on weekends3. Function - I wanted something that held a laptop and extra monitor, maybe had extra room but not a ton was neededI got what I paid for. Assembly was easy and yes, it functions as I expected. I can fit my things on the surfaces, and while it's slightly cramped on the main desktop area, it's still usable. Size of the desk is fine for me (I'm 5'2\") but a little bit small for my husband. The extra shelving is nice for notebooks, pens, water bottles, etc. The pieces of the desk are somewhat scratched and scuffed, and were very dirty when taking them out of the box. I've wiped down a couple times and still find dust/dirt spots, so may take a few more passes. Regarding assembly, there are small plastic \"feet\" that nail into the bottom, though I can't tell if they actually help because the desks are pretty wobbly and wouldn't stand up well if accidentally bumped. I'm not worried about it falling over as I type, but there is some wiggling going on with gentle movement. May need some tightening on the screws (but both are like this - one worse than the other).The only big issue I have with the desk is that the edges of the desktop are quite sharp. Not to the point of drawing blood, but definitely not comfortable when resting my arms against it while typing. The edges could stand to be rounded to maybe minimize this. I may end up finding some way to cover it to provide a little more padding to prevent my forearms from bruising.Overall, yes, I'd recommend this product for a person looking for a cheap desk option that can be moved around as needed. It isn't the Cadillac of desks by any means, but it does serve the purpose, especially for what it cost.",

                "reviewText": "I relocated my mid-tower home server, from a high shelf in a closet, to a long storage closet in the opposite side of my basement. This closet is often really cold, and makes for an ideal location for a server, especially since there is a network switch in the closet for a hardwired home network. However, I did not have a desk or small table to place my server, display and peripherals on for when I want to directly access it for upgrades and so my server and small monitor sat on a pair of chairs. This was the cheapest desk I could find on Amazon, so I ordered it and got it next day.Assembly was actually really straightforward, I saw it took one reviewer two hours to assemble. My question is HOW? The instructions state it takes 30mins to assemble, but this took me 20mins at most sitting on the floor. Instructions were okay, but I wasn't expecting much. Assembly hardware is also okay, I don't worry that it's going to break or fall apart. I believe this will bare the weight of my server, monitor, peripherals and Raspberry Pi (PiHole) just fine considering I will rarely be sitting using this desk. It's primarily just a place I can plop my server out of the way.Overall, I am very pleased and believe I got great value for the money and so I would highly recommend this desk. Please note, if you are at your desk every day or have a heavy PC or screen you should check out other desks on Amazon, this is not for heavy devices or heavy usage.",

The leg space is ample \u2014 I'm 5'7\" \u2014 but I see how it could be inadequate for 6-foot-plus folks. The bad part is that the surface is a dust magnet, and I live in Southern Brooklyn where pollution is relatively low, and have my windows closed all the time, and still it needs regular wiping. It also stains very easily, and if the stains are not immediately clear, they stick. And it is not sturdy at all. It contorts in awkward angles and even accidental hits rattle the table, and hence all the items it holds. My small monitor almost fell once but my spidey sense caught it in time. Recommended for simple low-key usage for small rooms, but it will be worth it if you spend slightly more and get something easier to clean and more stable.",
