                "reviewText": "This is my second standing desk, and I went with a bit higher of a price point for a better quality desk....so glad I did! Though I got the desk in black, the glass top was a big selling point. It is simplistic yet stylish. Looks quite expensive, especially compared to other more expensive ones. Size-wise, 48x24 comfortably fits a monitor, laptop, and printer with room to spare. I also like the added pen tray. Even though it is plastic, it is sturdy and spacious. It rolls out smoothly and keeps all the small things that clutter a desktop tucked away and organized. The hangers on each side are a little tacky, as they wobble and make noise. I'm thinking of removing them.The desk, itself, was easy to assemble once I found the video instructions on this product site. My box didn't come with assembly directions, and I spent a good portion of time looking for it. Lifting the glass part of the desk to see if it was under there was a pain because it was heavy. Thankfully, I found video instructions on the Amazon product page. Fairly easy to assemble alone. The different screws were packaged and labeled. For most of the hardware, tools were provided, though I did need a screwdriver for the screws used to attach the button panel. All screws were well threaded, and all holes lined up perfectly. The only difficult part was trying to get the glass top out of the box by myself. It was heavy and very well packed in styrofoam and cardboard spacers, although I do appreciate how well packed the item was.Once assembled, it was easy to arrange the cords with the 3M cord organizers provided and set my preferred sitting/standing heights. The desk moves up and down smoothly and quietly. There is a gentle hum as it moves, but it's not an issue for me.Completely happy with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "An assignment was given to me to find a standing electric desk for my son. There are so many products to choose from on Amazon and it took me days to narrow down products. INNOVAR desk was one of the 4 finalists and the cheapest. But as I read reviews more carefully INNOVAR turned out to be not just cheaper than the others, but also a better product than others.Initially, I received a wrong desk product from a different brand. But Amazon quickly fixed this issue and sent the right one. And it was worth the extra two days of wait.First off, the packaging was great. The tabletop is glass but you will see it is well-protected.Frame finish quality is good and parts are numbered for easy assembly. As some reviewers noted, the white color is not pristine white but rather cream-white. In my case this is what I was looking for and no complaint about the color at all. Screws and all parts are well packaged and they come with extra pieces, which is a nice gesture from the manufacturer.Assembly was easy and the motor sound, when adjusting height, is not as loud as described. The table height adjustment range is perfect for a 7'-11\" tall boy and he is very happy with the desk.White color was the only option at the time of purchase, but now I see that black color one is also offered and I am tempted to get one for myself...!",

I have a small nook in my bedroom for a little office and thought this was an excellent value. It's BEAUTIFUL. Slick and white with a glass top. It was easy to put together and I did the whole assembly myself in about a half hour. Most people should have someone to help though, it's a heavy desk and awkward to handle.My workspace is soooooo pretty now. Freshly painted walls, new office chair and new computer and this desk really ties it all together. I was a little hesitant when I ordered, simply because there were not reviews. Never fear, it works as promised. There are 4 pre-sets, that you can re-set to your likely . The desk is ULTRA QUIET and there is a display that lets you know the heights as you push the buttons. I would 100% recommend. The best 'big' purchase I've made in a long time.",

                "reviewText": "BEST DECISION I'VE MADE!I did a lot of research and the other standing desks I have come across are all particle board and have weird splits down the middle that sound like they sag with too much weight. THIS glass top is not only beautiful and nice quality, but it's a whole-piece top and incredibly sturdy. Was able to assemble in about 30 minutes. The instructions are pretty decent!Love the sit/stand aspect, it gets me up and not hunched over all day long! It goes pretty tall too, I'm 5'9 and I don't use anywhere near the tallest setting.While these aren't dealbreakers, just a few things I've noticed. 1. My mouse does not work on the glass top. Kind of funny, but nothing a little mousepad/desk pad can't fix. 2. It does not come with a cord box. Not the end of the world (I knew this when I purchased), but I'll be purchasing a cord box separately to attach because my cord set up looks messy.ALSO, PROPS TO AMAZON DELIVERY PEOPLE! It came on time, not a bit of damage. I have a mail room that can hold extra large packages, but they brought it directly to my door and helped my shimmy it inside the doorway. (I'm so glad I didn't have to lug it to the 4th floor by myself! It's HEAVY.)",

I adjust the height throughout the day going from sitting to standing with such ease. I absolutely love it! The drawer is amazing- a little difficult to open, but such a minor thing.",
