So as I am putting it together I begin to realize that not just with this product but most desks there are a lot of screws. I do not mean just a lot I mean a lot of different screws. I really hate that part but hey thats a personal preference not a flaw in the product itself. The warnings tell you to not to use the wrong screw as it might damage the desk. True. Didnt happen to me since I can follow instructions. However I will say this Do not try and over tighten the screws because they keep going and if you are not paying attention it will go through to the other side. I almost had this happen but was paying attention and listening for when I thought far enough was far enough. I say this because some places the product will not sit flush which would make you want to keep tightening the screw, but just do not do it! Thanks. Thats all I have to say for this product. All in all good product.",

Instructions were clear and offered both the left hand and right hand assembly instructions. Once together, it\u2019s super sturdy. No shake or wobble. I could stand on it and jump and still feel safe. Now my spouse wants one for their home office space.",

                "reviewText": "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is the worst, low quality piece of garbage I have ever bought on Amazon.I bought this desk as a birthday present for myself since I needed a new desk. I'm pretty good at assembling furniture and haven't had any issues with this sort of thing in the past. When I started assembling the desk, I went with the left version instructions. When I got to the step where I was supposed to attach the \"D\" labeled wood pieces, I noticed that there were only 2 holes drilled into each piece, totaling at 4 holes not drilled. There was allegedly supposed to be 4 holes on each piece of wood. I know people aren't good at reading furniture assembly instructions, but I took a lot of machine shop classes and know what I'm doing.Whatever invalids at the factory didn't drill all the necessary holes into the product. I was was robbed of $30 because I had to buy the necessary drill bits to fix this issue. I ended up missing raid because I didn't have a desk to play games on. I was up until 12am making the desk that should've been done by 8pm. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY!",
