I was very much trapped. I got this @ $139 - $20 Amazon coupon. For the amount of desk you get, totally worth it.The drawers are indeed fabric but very sturdy.I recommend a two way driver to assemble, something with a snub nose. Many of the screws are going into particle board via predrilled pilot holes and I imagine trying to put this together with the included Allan wrenches would be rather tedious.I assembled it during work and because I'm an idiot, I started building it opposite to how I actually needed it and had to take it apart several times. However, the instructions are actually really clear and easy to follow (even though the word lights is misspelled on the box, which made me nervous about the instructions) I'm just an idiot with an inability to visualize and a lack of recognition of left and right.I say all that to say if you need a desk and this is all you can afford, you could do much much much worse.",

                "reviewText": "I selected this desk for my son\u2019s bedroom. It is a nice large desk, and fits in his space well. He loves the option of adding the LED lights, and thinks the flexibility of all the different shelves are cool for storing his tech stuff.It was generally easy to put together, and the instructions were fairly clear. There were a few pieces that were difficult to put together, so be sure to leave hardware loose when wedging in pieces. This desk took approximately 2 hours for a teenage boy to assemble. The bottom drawer has slides to accommodate files.The construction feels solid, and I like that the top shelf can be put in different positions to accommodate large monitors. Overall I am very happy with the quality of this desk, and I think my son will be using it for many years.",

Like with most flat pack containers plenty of assembly is required.The overall desk design was highly functional and the shelves and LEDs were both better then expected. I have been using the desk for a few weeks and really have no complaints, I definitely am not using as a nerd gaming desk but the extra shelves and varying sized areas have been surprisingly useful. I really cant complain about either my computer setup or my reference peripherals.",
