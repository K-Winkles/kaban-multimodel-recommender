The hooks on the side are rather pointless unless you had a tiny tower as there isn\u2019t enough room to hang anything without it laying on the tower. But they were easy to put together, seem sturdy and looks nice.",

                "reviewText": "My wife started working from home and we needed a desk for her to use. This looked like it would be a good fit for what she was doing and the price was right. The only issue is, her work issued her a laptop and not a desktop CPU, which ate up a good portion of the real estate on the desk. That isn't the fault of the desk, but even without that, it's a shallower than I realized and the workspace is a bit cramped once you put two monitors, a keyboard and mouse up there. Also, if you're taller, you may find that there isn't enough legroom underneath.Assembly was straightforward and all of the hardware was in the packaging and, once assembled, it is sturdy.",
