                "reviewText": "My daughter needed a desk for her new school semester. She and I browsed at about a hundred different desks with reviews in Amazon and came across this desk from TIQLAB. She liked the little \u201cL\u201d shape especially the outlet and USB located on the top of the desk for monitor and iPad hookups.I was surprised on the inexpensive price tag so I was a little skeptical on its quality and the installation instructions. After a few more rounds of research, we decided to give this desk a try. And we are glad we made the right choice.We bought it after the new year. It came on time and we set it up right before school starts. The packaging is small and it was light enough for me to carry it from upstairs to downstairs without much trouble.I searched YouTube for instructional video but they don\u2019t have one. The manual was actually detail enough without any issues. It took me about 25 mins but I am sure someone with an electric screw driver will be faster. I just used the included hexagon key with screwdriver tip in the screw package (I didn\u2019t use my electric screwdriver as I was installing it manually with my daughter).The desk is very sturdy because of the bracings. The leveling legs helped with a little uneven hardwood floor. The desk top outlet and USB were very convenient hiding behind the monitor. The thing I like most is that they came with an extra screw of every type. I accidentally lost one of them during the process.Overall, it was a good bonding time for my daughter and I on the installation. We love the experience and so far my daughter love doing homework on her new desk!",
