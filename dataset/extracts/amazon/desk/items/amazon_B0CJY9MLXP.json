                "reviewText": "The final result was a desk with every feature I was looking for that seems very sturdy. The style is also nice. I am happy I ended up with the pull out key board shelf, the file drawer, the extra shelves. there's plenty of room for storage for sure. Baskets fit nicely on the shelves to store items without visual clutter.The end result was that everything went together exactly as expected with no disappointment with how it functions.My one and only complaint is that it took the better part of a day for my husband and I to put together. The pictures in the instructions are very hard to see detail.... and believe me, you will have to pay very close attention to detail. there are very few words... mostly pictures and they either don't show detail or are too small to see what you need to. The pictures focus in on the exact part but don't show the bigger context. We got one cross bar installed with the holes facing the wrong direction and had to take it half apart again.And the absolutely worst part was figuring out how the bracets attach for the pull out key board shelf. it was very confusing. Absolutely not one single thing comes pre-set/assembled. you will be installing every last bracket and piece of hardware.",

Don\u2019t fully tighten everything until the end bc some steps need room to slide into place before you fully tighten the screws. Install the power source before you install the top shelf. Assembly took me about 3 hours. It does show fingerprints easily but they wipe away with some surface cleaner.",

It took 2 people 2 hours to assemble because there are so many parts, but it went together smoothly and we followed previous feedback to not tighten everything down until assembled to ensure better alignment of parts. We had to repair the main desk wood surface, the corner was cracked (not broken off), filled with wood glue and put some finishing nails into it. The cracked part is at the back middle, so cosmetically it cannot be seen. One of the assembly pieces broke when torque was applied. One screw as defective and could not be used. One leg had a dent in it, again on the back side.",
