                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a college student renting a campus apartment (which is fairly small) and I was looking for a desk that would fit in my room ,but would also allow me enough space to spread out and fit at least both my laptop and iPad. This desk not only fits both of them, but it allows for so much space to spread out. I love that there is a slight \u201cL\u201d shape which provides just enough extra room for anything else I might need on the desk. At first I was a little skeptical about the fabric drawers, but they\u2019re actually great and provide for a \u201csoft close\u201d. The drawers are also a lot longer than I thought and I have no issue fitting anything I need in them. The desk was also really simple to put together and the directions were easy to follow, I didn\u2019t have the correct size screwdriver or Allan wrench, but two of each were provided with the parts. I was able to complete it with no help in about 1.5 hours.",

I ordered this on Friday night - it arrived Sunday morning, and I'm using it to type this review right now. It's sturdy and easy to put together, but some of the screw holes weren't exactly lined up where they needed to be. I was able to get it to work though.I put the shelf on the side end of the desk instead of on one of the back walls of it because I want it to be a stand for my tower instead (it's perfect) but my cat had fun climbing on it before I moved my computer in haha.Great quality for the price, was relieved to find an L-shaped desk for less than sixty dollars.",

Middle Left Side Support One.It was broken even with there being no damage to the packaging.So, I.... don't entirely know if it's normal or just a case of a random bad weld.However, it does look nice, and it's smaller than what you'd think in the pictures height wise, but it definitely is a nice desk for what it is!Hopefully maybe they'll ship me a new middle left support leg for me to replace it later, since it does compromise the stability a decent amount if moved.Will update stars if I get a response to get a new middle left support leg, as Amazon wanted me to ship it back. When I already had ... put more than half of it together. So......Anyways bye reviewer readers.",
