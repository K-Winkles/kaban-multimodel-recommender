                "reviewText": "So I picked this desk up for my oldest son. He\u2019s an online gamer and has been \u201cworking\u201d with a much smaller desk. I\u2019ll start with the assembly. It wasn\u2019t difficult to put together and took I\u2019d say about an hour total. There\u2019s a lot of pieces and hardware to keep organized so keep that in mind wherever you build it. We thought about placement and being modular, how he wanted to configure it. That in itself is a plus since you have options. We decided on the L-shape configuration and once assembled, I was pretty happy with how solid it felt. Even the accessories are either bolted in place or have solid rubber feet to keep them in place. The next big plus are all of the accessories you get. The drawers are decent, nothing really special. But you also get the added shelving and bin as well as the option to use the perforated board with hooks for added accessories. The bottom line is, this desk offers plenty of options for you to set it up as custom as you\u2019d like. The only thing I thought might be better thought out is the built in power strip. While very nice to have, I personally would prefer it hidden under the desktop rather than on top. To me, under mounted power strips are easier to keep your wiring clean and tucked out of the way. Overall though, I\u2019m very happy with this desk and my son was super thrilled to have a larger and modular gaming space to enjoy. I hope this helps you!",

                "reviewText": "This desk is well made. Its metal frame makes it very sturdy compared to other desks made of particle board with cam locks. This one is all metal (except the tops) secured with bolts. It should hold up for years even if it has to be moved.I really like the care they took to put numbers or letter on each part and bolt, so you can be sure you have all the parts before your start assembly. The steps are easy to follow as they have a drawing for each step with the part number and count. I have never put complicated furniture together that was so well planned out.The desk is very light weight for its size, as it uses fabric drawers and aluminum supports, but it still feels solid.My only complaint is that the LED light strip included was stick on, and the sticky surface was not sticky enough to keep the end connected to the power from slowly pulling down. I added a cable tie at that end to solve the problem, but I think they should have provided a better solution.",

                "reviewText": "I am using this desk in my own personal use in my man cave for handling all my technology adventures. While for me the initial cost seemed a bit steep, the investment is undoubtedly worthwhile once you experience the sturdy build, well-thought-out design, and the myriad of features this gaming desk offers. I like the sturdiness and well-designed structure of the desk are evident in every detail. The inclusion of shelves, drawers, and a mobile CPU stand offers abundant storage options, ensuring a clutter-free and efficient environment. One standout feature is the thoughtful addition of a pegboard with hanging hooks and headsets. I would highly recommend the gaming desk to those who value quality and functionality in their gaming setup.",

The design is genius and the quality is more than good, it's fantastic. I've assembled a lot of items in my day and when assembling this desk I was amazed at the engineering. It's incredibly sturdy, solid, and durable. Every hole, bolt, screw, etc. went together perfectly! It has table mounted plugs and USB ports and features a nice RGB LED strip. And the instructions were actually easy to follow and correct, which is a rarity anymore. It takes a while to assemble alone, but it's easy. This desk deserves 6 stars, I love it!",
