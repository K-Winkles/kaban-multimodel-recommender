Took my husband and I maybe 5 minutes to put together. You could absolutely put it together by yourself in no time though. It has adjustable feet so you can level it too which is really nice if you live in an old house with uneven floors like I do. Lol. It\u2019s plenty big enough too, my laptop and ipad fit with plenty of room to spare. You can\u2019t go wrong if you just want a simple little desk! So happy with this desk! So very happy with this desk. It fits perfectly behind my couch so I can finally work comfortably remote at home. I love natural light and wanted my desk near the windows but didn\u2019t really want to see it so I\u2019m so thankful this is in white. Blends in perfectly and not really noticeable until you walk around the couch. We have desks in every room of our house and this one is by far my favorite.Comes with tools, hook, canvas storage, and extra screws. The storage tote fits so much and even holds my huge laptop.Desktop surface is large and sleek. Has texture like wood and a gloss finish. Photos of attached cord organizer does not come in package. I ordered that separately, specifically for this table desk.Would i buy again. YES!!! The material is sturdy much better than the W store and Swiss store desks I had previously purchased. If you like clean simple lines this is an excellent desk option. Nice Small Writing Table! This is a nice small desk. Not too large but not too small. It was relatively easy to assemble and straightforward. I like that it holds my printer and some other small things without an issue. Good purchase! Good Value! PROS\u2022 Simple modern design\u2022 Sturdy\u2022 Easy-to-assemble\u2022 Instructions manual\u2022 Adjustable legs\u2022 Metal legs\u2022 Non-slip & anti-scratch\u2022 Protect floor scratching\u2022 Reducing noises while moving\u2022 Waterproof top layer\u2022 Diagonal bar (extra support)\u2022 Headphone holder\u2022 Fair priceCONS\u2022 The table top is made of thick ParticleboardOverall: Quality small sturdy desk for dorm rooms, small spaces, or kids. My favorite feature is the diagonal bar, which gives it extra sturdy support.Thanks for reading!",

Great for my daughter to use for her iPad and drawing or watching something on my laptop. I bought her one of those crayola art cases to use for her drawing and just didn\u2019t think about 1) how big the case was or 2) how obsessed with it she would be and how she wouldn\u2019t want to transfer the crayons, markers, and colored pencils to another more size appropriate case to use with her desk haha. The desk just isn\u2019t big enough to comfortably have the case open while drawing. That\u2019s not the desk\u2019s fault and is entirely mine. Just a warning to maybe go bigger than you think you need.",
