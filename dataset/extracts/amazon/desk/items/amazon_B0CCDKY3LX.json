                "reviewText": "I purchased the standing desk for my wife, but it quickly became a favorite for everyone in our household. This desk is not only a visually appealing piece with its beautiful desktop color, but it's also highly functional with its ability to easily switch between standing and sitting positions. The flexibility to move around while working has been awesome for us, promoting better posture. The assembly process was a breeze, taking no more than 30 minutes to put together by myself. The instructions were clear and straightforward. I appreciate the sturdy metal steel frame and the water and wear-resistant desktop is a practical touch. The powerful, yet quiet motor ensures the desk adjusts seamlessly without disturbing the peace of our home office. Overall, this desk is a beautiful and practical addition to our home. I do recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for/at work. Currently I go back and forth multiple times daily from sit to stand and it\u2019s held up well so far. Seems to be built well and I felt like it was easy to assemble. I was able to assemble it myself. It holds twoMonitors and when it\u2019s adjusted in height, it seems to have no issues. It did arrive with a bent edge from shipping but I didn\u2019t want to wait for a replacement so it didn\u2019t contact the seller. Even though there seemed to be safe guards in place, the tabletop was still damaged in transit. I have been able to wipe off pen and sharpie so far with wet wipes. I like it. It may not feel the most sturdy as my other over sized office furniture but I also have not seen other stand to sit desks in person for comparison so it might be normal! I love it so far",

I am 6'5\" and it goes to my chest.Goes very low. Wife is 5'6\" and it's to her hips.What I did not like is the wire management. There is none.Assembly tip: If installing the controller on the right, don't tighten down the top all the way so you can slip in (3) 12\" zip ties. Mount the controller. Then attach your wires and zip them in place behind the cross member. Then tighten the top down.Same for the leg, add (2-3) 12\" zip ties to secure the power wire to the upper sliding leg.",

I usually only adjust once or twice a day so I can live with it being a little noisy and slow for the price of it. The packaging wasn\u2019t great, and the desk did arrive damaged but thankfully it\u2019s at the back so it isn\u2019t noticeable. It looked like one of the corner protectors wasn\u2019t put on properly. I think it\u2019s fairly well made and sturdy and for the price, it\u2019s a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "Being the 1st time using one i wasn't wanting to spend multi hundreds on a adjustable desk. After watching/reading alot of reviews I came across this desk with a solid top (no seam in middle) and took the risk (low reviews at time of purchase) and bought it. It arrived with NO damage and on time! I didn't find any issues with anything not lining up like what others have had with theirs and it went together (taking my time) in less than 20min. It feels mostly solid with a very slight sway (i expected that). It does have a slight low hum from the motor but not overwhelming and has a slow movment speed when raising/lowering but that makes it easier if your trying to level up to another surface close by. It doesn't have anything for any kind of cable management but that can be bought elsewhere. I feel its a great sanding desk and even better choice compared to the more expensive ones for those who are just thinking of getting into them. I'd buy it again",
