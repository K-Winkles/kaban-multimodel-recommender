                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this to replace an L-shaped desk that I'd been using for years that's falling apart. I'm shocked at how much I like this desk. The extra space that the hutch provides is very nice, and the cabinet is a nice touch to store my art books.There is a lot of space. The wider part of the desk is great for a computer setup, and the hutch part is narrower as to not make you feel cramped. My only complaint is that the hutch above the workspace is not very tall, and cannot accommodate for taller things such as a desktop or a monitor. If you are using this desk as a computer workstation, make sure you get a deskmat or some kind of dampener as the actual desk tops will make keyboard sounds very loud.Assembly is not a fun process. The instructions are detailed enough that if you've assembled furniture before, you should be fine. It did take about 5-6 hours though as an able-bodied young adult.However, when it's all assembled and done, it's a fantastic workspace. Very roomy with lots of shelving to display trinkets, prize figures/noodle stoppers, and books. I would definitely buy again!",

It did take a bit of time since it is a more complicated style of desk but the final product speaks for itself. I combined this desk with a second desk from sedata in the same color and it turned out great. This desk is great for displaying collections and holds a good amount of weight. Great desk overall and works great for my setup.",

I was able to put it together by myself with the exception of putting the glass door in the coordinating holes.\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fPretty sturdy, I trust it to hold up everything I intend it to",

It took us about 3 hours to put it together. Directions are very straight forward, but you must be very through of paying attention to the hole directions/placements. The screws all fit evenly with the holes. Using an electric drill made the building process much faster. My daughter was excited the LED strip lights came included with the desk with multiple color options. Overall I am very satisfied with this desk.",

The seller was very kind to give feedback to the delivery service, who had not only failed to alert the household the package had arrived, but also stuck it against my garage by the trashcan and then proceeded to take a photo of the bottom of the box and their foot, leaving me with the task to figure out where they left my package. It's a 90lb box. Nobody was going to porch pirate that, lol. They could have put it on my porch.",
