I build a lot of Ikea and other types of furniture and this was a breeze. Great design, simple. And it folds up! Who Knew? There's a nice little \" Z \" bar that attaches to the side, so I hung my hairdryer. I love the white legs. Metal spray painted legs. The top is a faux wood in a very light birtch color. I am blown away by the quality and excellent design. This little desk can be used for anything and nice enough to go into any space. Just a great looking, highly functional and well made peice of furniture.",

I love this desk because you can fold it up and easily move it but it also has some weight so it is stable and solid. This is my second mini desk. I used the first one for taking photos for my jewelry business. This one I hope to use for various craft and art projects for my garden. Great price, easy to set up, easy to move around or fold up and store. Super useful!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a desk for a small space that I could put away when not in use, and this has fit the bill well. It was very easy to set up, and easily fold/unfolds when I need it to. It\u2019s small, but has plenty of room for everything I need. It would work well for someone who works from home occasionally as it has room for a laptop, mousepad, and a little extra for a notebook and maybe a coffee mug. Folded, it fits easily in a narrow space between my couch and end table. My only complaint is that the legs don\u2019t seem to be QUITE level, and one sort of floats while the other touches the ground, but it hasn\u2019t affected its functioning so it\u2019s not too big of a deal to me.",
