                "reviewText": "The one thing I really didn't appreciate about this desk was the screwdriver that was provided to put it together. Used a allen key screwdriver combo I had on-hand from something else I put together not too long ago- it really came in handy and made this a breeze to put together. The instruction diagrams were easy to follow, although they were kinda confusing in spots where it was indicating the screws behind or under a couple of sections.The top shelf was the most difficult part for me- due to the screws for the dividers...I mean they do fit and fasten....they just didn't want to lol- felt like they weren't meant to go under there and they don't fit flush to the surface so I questioned myself as I was following the picture... rest assured though, they do fit. It took a couple of hours to put it together by myself mostly cuz I was doing other things and I had a super small area to construct it in.The price is phenomenal compared to many other prices I've found online for desks with bookshelves or hutches. It's sturdy and does hold weight well. Mine was chipped on the front edge of the table but I attribute that to an evil delivery dude and, later on, my dad who thought it was his package and basically destroyed the box =_=### it'll just be its dimple...thinking of covering it with a sticker tomorrow.It's a very roomy feeling desk and I'm getting all happy thinking of reading, writing letters, doing my digital/traditional art (ohuhu brush markers are phenomenal btw but you proli couldn't care less about that right now \ud83d\ude05), and studying ...Overall it's pretty awesome and just looks amazing. Small enough to fit into my little room but big enough to house everything I need it to as well. True to the measurements. The top shelf is below eye level for a 5'3\" person- it's shorter than I thought it would be, but that was honestly a pleasant discovery in my case. Super happy I didn't pass this one up.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: You need to understand \"build-by-image\". The build quality is great. It's durable; sturdy, but has a little wobble to it. Is good size, and has room for books / trinkets underneath and above the main desk area. Would recommend.If you are not familiar with building furniture by an image (like ikea), I'd advise you find a friend who is to help you. This desk's build instructions are laid out in 4 steps by image. There are some numerical errors on the pieces themselves, you will need to identify a few pieces by the image steps. There are 14 desk pieces to assemble, with hardware and a tool included, but I would have a Phillips-head screwdriver handy to make the build a little easier. You will need 30-60 minutes to build this desk with a friend.When you finally have the desk built, it's a good size. Perfect for a teenager or adult. It has a wobble to it, even with the height adjusters on the legs. I don't think it would fall over but if you bump into it, but you have small trinkets on the top, they will move and/or fall off. The under desk shelf doesn't have an edge to stop books from falling to the side if you will be storing books there as advertised. We placed a book set on the edge to resolve this small issue.The desk piece itself had a minimal chip on the right side (not visible after build), likely due to shipping. Our package had a large tear that was taped back together during shipment. We didn't find the imperfection bad enough to return as the desk as it was not visible, and the desk will withstand a bit of wear in its lifetime.Desk quality is good. All pieces are completely finished on all sides, not like others with non-visible sides showing the particle board construction, which personally I didn't expect at this price range. This also means that durability is going to be good over time, and a spill here or there isn't going to ruin this piece.Shipment was very fast considering the expected delivery was still 1.5 weeks away when it arrived.Easy to assemble (4-stars): For some errors in the guide, otherwise the build was straight-forward.Sturdiness (4-stars): Has a little wobble to it if you bump into the deskValue for money (5-stars): Finished pieces on all sides, uncommon at this price range. Good size desk with lots of open storage.",

I have to use drilling machine to make holes. Allen key and required screws are quite Good quality and excess one set of Screws and fittings provided, appreciated.

                "reviewText": "I (and my family members) recently purchased the Computer Desk with high hopes of creating a functional and stylish workspace. While the desk itself has potential, I must admit that my overall experience with its assembly was quite disappointing.To begin with, the assembly process turned out to be far more complicated and time-consuming than I anticipated. The instructions provided were not as clear as I had hoped, and I found myself struggling to identify the proper alignment for certain components.What particularly dampened my enthusiasm was the considerable amount of time I had to invest in putting together the desk. Assembling furniture is not a new endeavor for me, but this desk took an unexpectedly long time to assemble, which was a major inconvenience given my busy schedule.I spent hours meticulously following the instructions and attempting to decipher unclear illustrations, only to realize that I was still far from completing the desk.On the positive side, once I managed to successfully assemble the desk, it did offer a spacious and appealing workspace. The desk\u2019s design is sleek, and the materials used appear to be of decent quality. However, the satisfaction I derived from the final result was overshadowed by the frustration and time spent during the assembly process.In conclusion, while the Computer Desk has potential to be a functional and stylish addition to any workspace, the assembly experience was far from satisfactory. The lack of clear instructions, combined with the extended time required for assembly, left me feeling quite disappointed. If the manufacturer could address these issues and improve the user-friendly nature of the assembly process, this desk could become a much more appealing option for those seeking a convenient and efficient home office solution.",
