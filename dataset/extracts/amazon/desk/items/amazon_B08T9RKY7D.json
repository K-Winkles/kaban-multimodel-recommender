She and I put it together ourselves in probably about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.The directions were mostly good. I put one piece on backwards and had to take a few pieces off to flip it around, but because of the way it's put together, doing so was relatively easy.The desk itself feels solid, the drawers slide nicely. My daughter wants to change out the drawer pulls, and we mat do that at some point, but we both agree it looks fine for now.It's a great desk and I feel like it's a great value too. No complaints here.",

Package was super heavy to lift and It did come in a million pieces, took me about an hour and 15 to build it all. All I needed was a Phillips head screw driver! Instruction manual was easy to follow. Only pictures no words! Super sturdy, cute, and clean! Bigger than I thought but that\u2019s okay!",
