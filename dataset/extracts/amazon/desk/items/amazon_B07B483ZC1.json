                "reviewText": "There are approximately 500 corner desks on Amazon so it took me a few weeks to narrow down what features were important to me. I wanted a rounded outside corner, metal and wood with a farmhouse coloring, and feet instead of bars that went along the floor.The desk arrived fast and in a compact box. Assembly was a cinch, it took about 20 minutes to assemble. All the bolts were hex head and required tools were included. The finish on the metal bars is of high quality. I believe it may be anodized and not painted because it has an extremely durable finish. The desktop itself impressed the most as it\u2019s got 3D grain. Even just a few years ago they didn\u2019t have anything that looked and felt this nice.The size of the desk is perfect for my needs. It would work just fine with a gaming PC and large monitor but I use a compact 15\u201d gaming laptop. I also needed space to fit my laser printer and space to measure and cut. This desk is just the right size, doesn\u2019t require a bunch of people to assemble or put together, and looks really nice with any decor.I chose the large size so the sides were equivalent length and I\u2019m glad I did, since I have the same amount of space on each side of me. I also needed a desk I could pull my wheelchair under and this does the trick. Lots of older desks are just too low to the ground. I checked out the big blue box furniture store and while they had some similar options, they couldn\u2019t come close to the price on this. The workmanship and quality of materials in this desk far surpasses any product I\u2019ve gotten at that other store. The bolts can be tightened up nicely and it is sturdy enough for a desk or even electronics workbench (similar to what I needed.)Here are the photos before we moved it into our office. Our house is really dark so I wanted to get some decent photos of it to share. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "Very nice! The boxing was questionable I think it might have been checked or something cause the Styrofoam was broken up and everything. Anyways its very nice and fits right into the small corner next to my bed. Even so it still has a lot of space, more than I actually needed. The assembly was very easy for a young person like myself, when putting it together you could tell its very high quality. The leg space is good if even when I put stuff underneath it, I have good leg room. If you're tall and you want to put things under it, you might have a hard time. It's not shaky unless you purposely shake it. My cat also immediately jumped on it after it was done putting it together if that helps anything lol. Now onto a con. It took forever to get here! It was due on the 31st of December, but it was running late and just got here on January 3rd. I'm not blaming anyone because it is big and heavy, and that's why I didn't request a refund but even, so I was very impatient and anxious! Ok that's all! If you're thinking of buying this, go for it! It's very good.",

                "reviewText": "I just recently got into computers a bit. I enjoy playing games and I also like to upgrade and tinker on them. I had been working off of a plastic fold out table. It just wasn't cutting it. But I am not exactly floating in the dough right now. As I am sure most people can feel me there. I was looking for something cheap, and I only had so much room for a desk. So I shopped around a bit and ended up looking at this desk. I got it pretty quickly. It was a little heavy. It was packaged pretty good. The instructions were pretty decent. And assembly was pretty easy. It was a little wobbly on my carpet at first, but I think it just needed to settle in a bit. The adjustable feet are nice. The case/tower platform may not work for you if your tower is to wide. I have duel monitors and one monitor is smaller than the other. So I repurposed the tower platform to a monitor platform. I actually think it works pretty good. For 70 bucks, I would say it's a good deal.",

                "reviewText": "For its price, this desk is pretty decent. Its exactly what I needed and the dimensions are perfect. The color matches the photos as well and it feels sturdy enough. However, I did have some issues putting it together.The instructions are clear about what you need to do and I didn't have any problems with this desk until the I started screwing in the 2nd piece of wood panel (the last and final part of this desk). The screw holes were slightly misaligned on the first side I was working on but it was manageable as I just had to tilt my screw slightly to properly tighten it in. But once I got working on the other side, thats when the issue really started. The holes were so misaligned on this side that even if i tilted my screws as far to the side as I could, it was still not fitting.I was so frustrated I gave up for a while thinking I might have to forgo the predrilled hole and just drill it into the wood. But then I realized the screws provided were not your standard type but the hexagon type and my electric drill didn't have that option. So drilling straight into the wood was now out of the question. I went back an hour later to see if I would be able to somehow get this together and after almost 30 minutes, I managed to force the screws far enough to the side that it fit into the holes. I pretty much had to bend some parts of the metal to make it work.After putting the desk together, it did look nice. There was no visible damaged parts where I had to force in the screws and it held together tightly. But I did have another issue and that it was a bit wobbly. I figured out it was one of my legs that was slightly too short (about 2cm) but it was nothing a little felt sticker couldn't fix.Overall, I had to problem solve + use a whole lot of muscle to put this desk together.-Was it troublesome and annoying? Yes.-Does it have flaws in the wood surface? Yes, one or two small scratches.-Was it completely leveled? No, slight wobble as noted above but fixable.-Did it match what I was looking for? Yes, it was pretty much exactly what I thought it would look like ; size and color wise.-How was the pricing for the product? Okay.Final thoughts: I could get a much higher quality, better constructed desk somewhere else with the similar sizing and color. However, it wouldn't be cheap. I'm not looking to spend 100's of dollars for a casual computer desk. The issues I had with this desk can be corrected with a bit of DIY and for the price I paid, I'm actually okay with it.",
