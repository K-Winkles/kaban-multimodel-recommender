It is fifty five inches across, making it the perfect size for up to three monitors and then some!I am 5'10\" and this is the most comfortable standing desk. The buttons make for smooth transitions up and down and you can save desk height settings. I put a walking treadmill under my work desk and it's wide enough that I can simply scoot it to the side when finished. Both of my desk came from the same seller. And these were really easy yo assemble. I just need to figure out where to put all of my computer cords. Overall I give this a 5 out of 5!!!!!! It goes perfect I'm my office.",

The electric function works great, it ended up being a little small for my ultrawide monitor, but that's a me problem, so no stars were removed on that account. I did however have a big problem with the keyboard tray. I wanted a keyboard so that I can hide my keyboard and mouse under the table. However it's not wide enough to fit both my keyboard and my mouse on it. Also when it's tucked underneath the table, there's not enough room for my hand to be in there as well, as it touches the top of the table. I ended up just removing the keyboard tray all together, and put my keyboard and mouse on top of the table. With a few small changes, it would have been perfect.",

There is no gap between the two top boards. It's not the quietest standing desk but it's not loud either and it's about what I expect.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it again.",
