Sorta like the art tutorials that show you how to draw like a lion or something but by step 2 it\u2019s already jumped to the lion fully drawn and now you have to shade it.",

I loved that all of screws are done with just an allen wrench.The charging station, in my opinion, should be pushed back further (like underneath the top shelf), to allow more usable space, but it\u2019s still workable. Since one side is used for my laptop, and the other side is used for my mouse, there\u2019s no real space for my desk organizer. However, with my side table right beside my desk, I can make that work.The instructions were confusing, at first, because they don\u2019t give \u201cdirections\u201d, they just give you pictures. But once my son and I studied them long enough, the assembly went very smoothly. Had all the parts, with extras just in case.Oh! I will say, though, the packaging looked like crap! Really beat up and torn. Surprisingly, everything inside was just fine.",
