For every type of screw, there's an extra included.I like the desk a lot! I don't know if I'll ever use the cup holder, but it's a cute touch. Speaking of gimmicky touches, one of the two under-shelf lighting strips doesn't stay stuck to the underside of the shelf. I'll either use more double-sided tape or glue it. Not a big deal. I still give the desk 5 stars.In case it's not clear from the description or the photos, the aqua color in their photo is just the black desk reflecting the LEDs. It's really a black desk. You don't even have to use the LEDs. The switch varies the color and turns it on and off.",

It holds up well, looks nice, and gives plenty of room for clutter or nice empty spaces, whichever you prefer.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, I would like to say that I love this desk. It was very easy to put together. Is plenty spacious for the four 29\" monitors that I run for work and gaming.That said, there are two noticeable things that come to mind that keep it just this side of being perfect. The first is the lighting. The lighting is great. However, they supply pieces of two sided sticky tape to put it up. I live in a very dry climate and adhesives tend to dry out. I've had this desk for less than a month and the lights are already falling. A couple brackets to hold them in place would be ideal.The second issue is that the desktops themselves do not line up. They're only off by about 1/8 of an inch but it's noticeable and sometimes when I stand up too close to the desk my shirt will catch on the protruding edges. This is easily fixed by just scooting back farther before I stand up and are minor issues in the scheme of things.",

The instructions were clear and everything seemed to be good quality. The desk seems to be solid after 2 months of use. Only thing that wasn't that great was the lights and my only issue with them was that they didn't give enough tape to hold it in place.",

It wasn't a essential part but who likes defects, I didn't bother contacting them since it fit. A few plastic pieces were broken that hold wire but they sent alot of extras. Over all its very sturdy, the 2 usb plugs and other regular plugs is a nice addition. Along with the lights which look cool. It's definitely worth a but in my opinion just check the parts incase they're damaged. I give it a 4.5 but put a 5",
