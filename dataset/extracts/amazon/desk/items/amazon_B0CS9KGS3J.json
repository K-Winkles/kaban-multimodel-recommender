This desk is 63\" x 31.5\", and the moveable side return is 39.5\" X 15.75\" - Perfect for my needs.You can move the return anywhere you want it, even if you put the 2 pieces across the room it looks nice.Assembly wasn't hard, but the bottom of the Cabinet/Return has holes marked where the screws for the feet should go, but the holes don't line up with the holes in the feet, I was able to overcome this issue with a slow cordless drill and there are supposed to be some plastic corner pieces that go in the back, but my particular box was missing those. Not enough to remove a star.Shipping was pretty quick, 2 boxes, 1 yesterday and 1 today, both still arrived before the delivery window I was given at purchase.Overall, very pleased so far.",

                "reviewText": "The desk is pretty nice. However, it was pretty difficult to put together at times as the pieces mentioned in the instruction manual did not always match the pieces you actually needed to use. We figured it out, but it took a bit longer to put together. Also was missing a few pieces, but they were non-essential but would have been nice to have.",

When assembling the desk I\u2019d recommend you not tighten the table top pieces until you\u2019ve placed all 4 tops. T this will allow you to align the top nice and evenly. Once all pieces are placed then tighten the screws.The table top is engineered so don\u2019t over tightened the screws to the top.Also once your desk is built do not try to lift it with the wood. Make sure when you move the desk, lift with the metal base or the screw would strip off the wood. \u201cSee video\u201d",
