                "reviewText": "This is an amazing and affordable desk, perfectly fits 3 monitors and 2 pc's! The only issue I saw was the ability to put monitor stands on the back of the desk as some clamps don't open wide enough, so just make sure you have a wide opening clamp on any desk stands so they will clamp securely. All in all very easy to put together and a seamless build for streamers or casual workers.",

                "reviewText": "The desk is alright, I wouldn't say it's a \"gaming desk\", it's just your normal, average desk. There's 3 things I don't like about it though...1) The desk itself is very thin, I bought the biggest size for $170, the wood seems fine, doesn't bend or anything, it also supports a ton of weight too (my pc is very heavy), but for the price; anybody could find something better from like IKEA and get a much nicer looking desk.2) It's not sturdy. The legs are all hollowed metal that feel very cheap, I really wish it was wood like the rest of the desk, then I feel it would be much sturdier.3) The height of the desk is just awful. Since I got the biggest size this thing just ended up looking like a long, children's picnic table from Walmart. It was annoying for me to game so low, so I ended up having to buy risers along with it the table which was very disappointing, but they get the job done.Overall I would just try to stay away from this desk. It's decent but if you're considering buying one of the bigger sizes you're completely getting ripped off, as you could easily buy something much much better from IKEA that's bigger, more sturdy, and honestly better looking for an even cheaper price.",
