                "reviewText": "I needed a no frills, simple desk. This fits the bill perfectly. Mine came with no damage or scratches. The only issue I ran into is that the clamp for my monitor arm was made in such a way that the gripper didn't grab right at the edge, but in about half an inch, so the grip pad only caught about 1/3rd of the bar under the desk lip. Nothing I wasn't able to fix with a little MacGyver action as you can see in the picture.As for assembly, yeah, you are going to have a bit of a tough time getting the legs onto the top brackets, they are tight, but that is a good thing! You don't want them wobbly and loose. Use a rubber mallet to tap them down onto the top frame.Aligning the holes to the desktop is another bit of trickery. Do not tighten all the screws on one side and then expect you will line up the other side - that is just assembly 101. I built this myself and it was a bit tricky to pull the parts into alignment and insert the screws, but it got done. Took me about 25 minutes to put it together.You aren't going to want to try to stand on this desk, not meant for that, but it is plenty sturdy enough for regular use. I love it and highly recommend it. You can't go wrong at this price. I am considering a second one to use as a sewing table because it is such a nice desk.",
