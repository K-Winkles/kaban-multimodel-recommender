I had been searching store to store looking for something nice, sleek, modern and sturdy. THIS FIT THE BILL!!! Oh my GOSH. Its more than perfect. It was easy to put together and I did it by myself. The extra pieces like the rack and clips were perfect. I bought the 55\" and it had more than enough room for my 3 monitors and desk accessories. The width is great too and there is enough space for writing, homework, studying, etc. I also bought a 3 drawer rolling cart that is 26.8 inches high to fit under it and OH MY GOSH. Can you tell I'm excited???.......LOL",

                "reviewText": "The desk is fairly sturdy and decently made. The dimensions for it were a perfect fit for the area I was placing it, and with a few creative connections to the external mounting pieces for the hooks, I created underneath storage for several items that might have been out and in the way otherwise. My only real issue was with a couple of the holes that had the internal plastic mounts for the screws. They were so tough to get the screw started, that I was worried it was cross-threading, and I would strip them out rather than get the screw fully in tight. However, with a bit of patience, and a lot of effort with the tiny screwdriver, I did get them past the part that was in a bind and it assembled perfectly as intended.",
