So it\u2019s acceptable. It did come with a broken door. Nothing a little wood glue and a couple Dowels couldn\u2019t fix. For the price I would have preferred to not to have to fix anything. One good thing is they gave more than enough hardware. When you left over hardware it makes you wonder, but after double checking everything is securely in place.Instruction are not good. They leave a lot of room for error. I have learned to always lay out a product before assembling. That saves a ton of time and headache. And believe me it did in this case. Yes the instructions are that bad. Might be easier to just look at the picture and assemble. It assembled quickly.Don\u2019t sit on the desk part.Here\u2019s some pros and cons.Pros: 1. Looks just ok. 2. Sturdy 3. Functional for a small office. 4. Plenty of hardware and backup pieces.5. Assembly time is quick, took me 30 minutes.Cons: 1. For the price? Not so happy. 2. Broken pieces. Several reviews had the same problem. 3. Instructions are terrible. But not rocket science. 4. Though it\u2019s sturdy given the attachment point being plentiful the materials are cheap so let\u2019s go back to, Don\u2019t sit on it.Would I recommend this to others? Both yes and no. If it\u2019s a front office purchase, that\u2019s a big NO. If it\u2019s for private occasional use, it\u2019s a Yes.",

                "reviewText": "While this is a great quality desk for the cost, with lots of legroom and a comfortable height\u2026 The manufacturer needs to take a look at the assembly instructions and make some improvements. While putting together furniture is rarely an easy process, this took me over 2 hours. Part of the issue was that the instructions (mostly small pictures) offer little guidance on how best to go about the assembly (like when to turn pieces over or on their side, ensure things are oriented the right way, etc). I ended up making a error at the beginning of the process that I didn\u2019t realize until the very end of the process, so I would have to dismantle a sizable portion because one hole was on the wrong side. The other issue was simply that I should have used an electric drill rather than using the tools provided. My hands were aching by the end. I would recommend this desk but I would rather walk barefoot across a floor covered in legos than deal with the assembly again.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased so much assemble it yourself furniture in my life (rooms and rooms full) and most of it is pretty shoddy. This one is surprisingly substantial and good quality. All the screw holes are properly threaded, and the screw in pegs have the proper plastic threaded fittings so you're not just going into bare particle board. All parts are labeled and the instructions were very good, even including extra tips where it might be easy to make a mistake. I'm happy to report that I only made one minor error while assembling this and it was very easy to realize and correct on my next step. Fair warning, it is a ton of pieces and even as a very experienced home furniture assembler it took me several hours, but the going was easy and there was nothing frustrating about the process at all. One other big positive is how it was packaged: hard plastic corner protectors on the desktop pieces. I really appreciated that because I've had more than a few pieces of furniture arrive already damaged out of the box. Everything here was pristine. I got mine on a black Friday sale, but I think it's worth the original list price of just under $200 and I would have been happy with it at that price.",

It pairs well with an extra dining chair I have in gray rattan. We were going for a modern rustic beach house or coastal vibe. One word of advice, however. Definitely follow the instructions to not tighten all the screws until the pieces are fitted. It can be hard to get the hardware to line up with the holes if you don't. The most challenging part for us was assembling the drawer and cabinet side of the desk for that reason. But overall a very nice desk with lots of workspace.",
