Everything as described, came inside the box and the directions were clear and easy for me to go over and to read.Side note:I had to really take my time with putting everything together because at first, it looked like there were holes missing but it was just my perception. ALL HOLES ARE ACTUALLY THERE!! JUST TAKE YOUR TIME AND PAY ATTENTION!!.When I finally put the desk together, I was just incomplete awe at how beautiful it looked and for the low great price it was, I just felt lucky.It is sturdy and definitely holds it's weight. It is the right size for me in all aspects, leg room long and tall, just perfect. I chose the color white and it goes great with my white gaming chair.The control system for the lights is easy to learn/use and the lights with many different modes are bright and vibrant.The middle and top shelves are such a great add on, so that is a major plus for me. However, I do wish that the desk \"without the monitor shelve\" had two shelves so that I could put my other gaming systems on but other then that, I am truly happy with my purchase!!.I recommend thus desk to whoever wants to buy an amazing desk for a price.",

The hutch provides ample extra space to store various items such as figures, HDDs, Docks, and the hutch is also great for monitors as I use mine for it. Honestly, this table was a pain to assemble at time but a great table that's pretty sturdy, quite stylish in a minimalistic way and has tons of display / storage space. I love that this table can be configured into either an L shape or something longer if you want / need it. If you're looking for a table with plenty of working space and then some, honestly, pull the trigger, especially at the price. The included LED lights are also quite bright and really cool functionality even if they are \"manual\" (The control for the lights are built into the table).",

                "reviewText": "After looking at probably 200+ desks for probably 4 hours over 2 days I found this one. I was looking for something really specific and this fit the bill. I was REALLY worried it was gonna turn out to be crap though because it only had a few reviews.This desk is great, especially since you can assemble it a few different ways. I thought the instructions were great, and it took me around 50 minutes to put it together & I'm extremely mechanically inclined. That being said, if your good with your hands maybe have someone help you. I also used an impact and allen socket instead of the crap allen keys that always come with furniture.The only thing that kinda sucks is the wood is all compressed wood, but all the furniture these days is, and this is actually still very sturdy.",

Definitely not something I'd un-build to move for any reason, but for $100 its absolutely perfect for my daughter and she loves that the lights change to lots of colors. It's a hit with both of us. Pro tip the box is heavy so make sure you have someone to help you when it gets delivered.",
