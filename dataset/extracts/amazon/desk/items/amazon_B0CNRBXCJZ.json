I love that despite being a standing desk it looks like a tradition writing desk, not the usual minimal design.It was easy to assemble and has a sturdy build. The motor has no issue raising my heavy monitor setup and it\u2019s nice that the height can be pre-set.The desk features three drawers and although they\u2019re fairly small, it can still fit basic office essentials. There is also extra space behind the drawers at the back of the desk, so that\u2019s where I mounted my power strip for hidden cord management.I\u2019d definitely recommend this desk, especially if you are looking for something different!",

                "reviewText": "After looking at many different style of office adjustable table (stand up table in general), I decided to give this one a shot for my home office use. The product turns out to be good and as described; however, the only thing you need to be aware of is the quality of the table tops. It comes with 4 wood pieces and the first one I received has scratched corners. So I have to get a replacement. I think for a standing desk at this price range (~200 dollars) it is a relative good deal. It has three adjustment memories slots and the speed to go from one end to another is about ~20 seconds. There are lot of other similar products out there; however, if you want a desk at a reasonable price range, be sure to check this one out!",

                "reviewText": "The desk is very nice and very well made! The building instructions were a bit of a challenge. This is not something a beginner to putting together furniture should attempt. Hire someone if you know this isn\u2019t your thing. There are two sets of instructions that at some point give you directions for putting together the same thing. Depending on the desk you\u2019ve purchased, you need to determine which instructions to put down and not follow. And yes, the peg and screw directions are revered in the instructions. You are not crazy lol Just go ahead and put the pegs and the screws where you know they should go. There are also some issues with holes aligning for the screws. Choose your battles wisely with this one because you may not win. You have to reset the rise and lower panel for it to work. The instructions don\u2019t tell you that but they do give steps for how to reset it.Overall, it\u2019s a great quality desk, it\u2019s beautiful and you are given everything you need to put it together. I had to give it a full star rating despite the instructions. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I planned on returning this desk.. It looks a little more \"Ikea\" than the picture. Because the return shipping was so expensive, I decided to keep and put it together. The instructions were pretty clear, it took a few hours to put together. I am disappointed in the drawers.. typical cheaply built drawers/glides.. The bottom of the drawers are a very thin press board.. The drawers do not slide smoothly, but they work. Over all the desk is sturdy, and the lift is working. It's nice to be able to stand and sit, without having one of those desk top units. Jury is out if I will keep it, or send to the consignment store..",
