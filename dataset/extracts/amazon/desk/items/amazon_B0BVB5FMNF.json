                "reviewText": "First off, the materials used for this desk are very sturdy and supportive. At first glance they could seem flimsy because it\u2019s two planks that you have to bolt together using a type of supportive expansion bridges, but the entire undercarriage of the desk creates a sturdy and firm desktop. I tried shaking the desk after building it, and it wouldn\u2019t budge so much as a desk from Costco or Walmart. There is also a great amount of space that allows the user to multitask or even create different areas for different purposes.I highly recommend this desk.",
