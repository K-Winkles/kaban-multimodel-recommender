I like the color variety, as well as the different light settings (single color, flashing through the colors, and fading between the colors). It fits my gaming laptop perfectly, with room for a mouse. The shelf is a really nice depth - it fits books, my pen storage, and my desk organizer. I haven't use it a whole lot yet, but so far it's been really nice.",

                "reviewText": "This desk was perfect for my son's tiny room. It fit in the corner perfectly. It came in a manageable sized box and was well packed. All parts came undamaged.It was quick to set up, even with a lot of child interruptions and while cooking Christmas dinner. The instructions were easy to follow, however there is 2 steps that were missing in the end, even though the numbers were still followed chronologically. It was pretty much self explanatory though at that point, as I only had one bag of screws left and the bottom corner shelf and the 2 outside back supports left to install. My only complaint, is the screws used in the keyboard drawer were very crappy quality and stripped easily, thankfully there was a bag of spare screws, as I stripped on of those ones pretty bad and it wouldn't go in any further than half way. The preholes were also not drilled in that far, and another screw went in on a slant and split the board a bit, but I don't see this being an issue. The screws that required an Allen key were a lot more solid.One reviewer said that the LED lights did not come with self adhesive, when in fact they do..so that was purely user error. You do loose a usb slot however to power them, so maybe a seperate dedicated one on the backside would make for a great improvement. Loved that the LEDs came with a junction box that is mounted to the desk to easily switch the colors and light patterns, finally lights we won't loose the remote to.All in all, I'm satisfied with the price and it's functionality currently.",
