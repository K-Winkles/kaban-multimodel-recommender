                "reviewText": "I have been wanting to try a standing desk but all the ones I seen were super expensive and I was concerned about spending too much on one to just not use it. I bought this on prime day and it also had a coupon so I got it for a good reasonable price where if I ended up not liking the standing part of it I didn't spend a lot of money to try it out. It's worth the full price in my opinion.Putting it together was really easy. You do need an wrench (adjustable or a set with the size needed) to put it together. It comes with an Allen wrench and a small screw driver but I ended up using a normal sized one I have at home. The motor comes attached and hooked up, all you need to do is plug it into the control box once you get it installed. I think it took me maybe 30 minutes to complete the setup.Sturdiness is there. I don't feel like it is wobbly at all and I adjust the desk up and down at least once during the day as I am not used to standing all day just yet and need to switch. I have 2 monitors, a laptop, keyboard, mouse and a docking station all on it and nothing shifts moving it up or down.Desktop is like any modern desk top that is on the cheaper end and made out of pressed wood. I personally don't have a problem with it and at this price point you can't expect it to be top quality oak anyway. It's a sturdy top and have not had any issues out of it. It holds everything I need it to hold with no issues and works perfectly.The controls are easy to use and has two memory settings that can easily be changed.Overall I recommend this to anyone wanting to try a standing desk.",

                "reviewText": "The desk is really beautiful and it moves up and down with ease. I\u2019d spent a great deal of time researching similar stand up desks on Amazon. Many had a split top with a seam. This one did had a single top and had wonderful reviews. Assembly was easy however one screw went through the top. I contacted customer service and explained the situation on their firm on Amazon. A follow up email requested that I provide the order information and a photo of our issue. They promptly responded by email that they\u2019d send a new top. They sent a new desk, tracking information and a reminder to check the frame for rubber gaskets to prevent the same issue from happening again. They even suggested we send photos if unsure of what we\u2019re looking for. We have not had a chance to assemble the new desk yet.I highly recommend purchasing this product. Quality product at a nice price point and excellent customer service!",

                "reviewText": "We have a similar desk from Amazon that we've been happy with for the past year, so we decided to give this one a try since it was on sale. I opened the box and assembled the desk today. As shown in the attached pics, during assembly one of the the legs was clearly sitting lower on the frame than the other, causing the desk to be slightly out of level.But I finished the assembly hoping that the legs would calibrate to a uniform height after going through a raise/lower cycle, or at least that the uneven legs wouldn't significantly affect the functionality of the desk. I followed the instructions to reset the lifter control and then raised the desk to it's top height. The desk raised fairly smoothly, sounded as expected, and seemed pretty stable at top height. I kept my level on the desktop to see if the leg height self-corrected upon being fully raised. It didn't.I then lowered the desk. Again it was fairly smooth coming down but had a faint but distinct thudding sound every few seconds as it lowered. I then raised the desk all the way up a 2nd time and upon reaching nearly full height one leg completely collapsed within itself. I had to hold that collapsed side up manually to be able to lower the working side back down. I inspected the leg to see if there was anything visibly wrong with it and tried again to raise it to no avail.Needless to say, since at least one of the legs can't even support the weight of the desktop, this desk can't support 154 lbs as advertised. If you give this desk a try, I strongly advise that you run it through an appropriate stress test to make sure it can raise/lower properly and support weight before you put valuable or fragile items on it, such as a computer and monitor or two. Thankfully I only had my level on the desk when it unexpectedly collapsed during setup.In addition to the broken leg, the desktop also has some color blemishes along the top edge, especially on the corners. I included a pic to show that.",

I like that this desk came with cable ties that stick to the bottom side of the desk to hide those pesky wires. 10/10 highly recommend. I will say you can definitely hear the motor when it\u2019s moving but it\u2019s nothing my games won\u2019t overpower.",
