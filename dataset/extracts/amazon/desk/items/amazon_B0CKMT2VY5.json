It was very simple to put together and only took about 20 minutes. Instructions were easy to understand and it came with all the tools and screws needed. The storage is perfect for any items a person would need to store for a desk and is very roomy. Also purchased a desk chair that fits perfectly. While it is sturdy I do not recommend anyone climbing onto it to superman off of. It won't hold the weight and the landing will not be comfortable. At least thats what we had to tell our son so he wouldn't try it. \ud83d\ude01",

I use it for a work bench for working on guitars and works perfect with plenty of space for a guitar and whatever tools I need with plenty of room to move around and work.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with the 48-inch Computer Desk with Drawers has been less than stellar, primarily due to a significant design flaw related to the tube connector thread holes.The provided bolts are disappointingly small, and when attempting to secure the tube connectors, it becomes clear that the thread holes are not flush with the surface. This tiny detail has a massive impact, as it makes tightening the bolts effectively impossible. As a result, the desk is left wobbly and unstable.The drawers, touted as a useful feature, are rendered less functional due to the inherent instability. The frustration of dealing with a desk that can't even securely hold together overshadows any convenience the drawers might offer.While the desk's size and appearance are passable, the flaw in the tube connector design, compounded by the use of undersized bolts, makes this purchase regrettable. Until the manufacturer addresses these issues, I would caution potential buyers to consider other options that prioritize stability and reliability.",
