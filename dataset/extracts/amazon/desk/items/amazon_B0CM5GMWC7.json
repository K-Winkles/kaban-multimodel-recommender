This desk is perfect for anyone tight on space or looking for a portable solution.First off, the best part: no assembly required! It came fully assembled, so I could start using it right away.The desk itself is just the right size at 31.5 inches. It fits nicely in my room without taking up too much space, yet it still offers plenty of surface area for my laptop, books, and other essentials.When I don't need it, I can easily fold it up and tuck it away. Plus, the black color looks sleek and modern, blending in seamlessly with any decor.Overall, this desk is a fantastic choice for anyone needing a small computer desk for their home office or study area.It's sturdy, convenient, and stylish\u2014all at a decent price.I highly recommend it!",

I feel for the price, the quality could be better, but for a portable table it is acceptable. Even if this table wasn't portable, it would still be nice light table.",

Metal legs don't have any shaking or wobble. This is perfect for tight spaces, small square footage, portability, and when you have company it could be a dinner table in a pinch.At the time of this review 1/8/2024, the price is 75.99 and a 5% coupon which is a fantastic price for the value!*Please view pictures and any video as I consider them part of my full review.",
