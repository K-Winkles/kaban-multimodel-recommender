I usually get it right but reversed two pieces and had to unscrew them and then screw them back together. If it wasn't easy to put together this would have been really hard! As it was it was a snap. Love the clean, smooth look. Every piece was perfect which was a testament to how well it was packaged. The outside box was so beat up I was sure the pieces were going to be damaged but not a single one was! Easy to put together and just great looking! Very satisfied with this desk and would order another if I had more room! Would make a great second work table!",

One of the metal legs should have had 2 screw holes but instead only had one in the middle so it couldn\u2019t be completed. Reordered the desk because I figured it was a simple mistake and now the second desk doesn\u2019t have all of the hardware required. I\u2019m missing 4 screws for the wood so I can\u2019t even finish assembly. I know it\u2019s a cheap desk but there are better options if you want to save the headache.",
