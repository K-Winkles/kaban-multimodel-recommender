It only had picture instructions and the screws it told you to use were wrong. Due to that, I've accidentally cracked the topside of my desk. Thankfully I have a desk mat to make sure it stays covered and won't peel the top. But still, it could have been avoided if they had better written instructions and correct screws with better part indicator.",
