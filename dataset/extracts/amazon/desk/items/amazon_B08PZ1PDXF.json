I will say the directions are abit confusing when adding the shelves part so watch that part very carefully when you're setting it up but other than that it was very easy to assemble and looks awesome. It was well packaged, nothing dent or broken. I love it and have even recommended it to a friend of mine and will be buying another when we move.",

It'll never be as solid as a full wood desk or one made with thicker metal pieces, but it feels good for what is provided. Maybe most important, the desktop material is nicely bound and feels comfortable to move around on. The three sections of desktop don't quite match up level-wise, but that's a minor complaint. Plenty of horizontal space, though the shallow depth doesn't leave much space for more than a notebook or a laptop.It took me about an hour to assemble the whole thing by myself. Reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like some folks don't pay attention to the orientation of certain frame pieces when assembling the desk. It really only goes together one way and it's possible to get through 3-4 steps before noticing an issue, so be careful. The desk comes with all of the tools needed, but having a full sized allen key definitely helps.I'm currently shopping for additional furniture and have no issue looking for more pieces by the same brand name.",

                "reviewText": "I saw many reviews about many desks on amazon, most of them stated that there was some trouble putting the desk together. Some said that holes were not aligned properly and so on.I had no problem what so ever assembling this desk. Took me probably a little over an hour. My photo is of how the separate pieces for the table top come together, only the piece above the shelf portion of the desk has a gap. Not noticeable enough for me to care and I could probably unscrew the top and adjust and have less of a gap.All in all I got this and like it a lot. Will be using it for carving wood, drawing, painting, and making music!I like the layout and it feels sturdy.",

My husband will be buying a matching one to put together to match mine so we can work side by side. I recommend this product 10000%! You definitely get your money\u2019s worth in this product. The only downfall is that the lifted up piece is a tad wobbly but not so much so that whatever you have on it would fall. I have my iMac sitting on it and it fits great!",
