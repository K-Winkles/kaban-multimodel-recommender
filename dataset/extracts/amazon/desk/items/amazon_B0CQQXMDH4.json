But I managed to bring both parts as close as possible by releasing the screws on all sides, then screw them again. I think it turned out very good and I love my new desk!",

It has a great appearance to it, easy assembly accept the fact that some of the letter labels were missing but it actually was still easy to put together! The color is great and the desk is actually quite sturdy!",
