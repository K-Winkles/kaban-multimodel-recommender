                "reviewText": "I can fit my pc, monitor, and a place for working (mostly just keep my mic, coffee, and laptop there). I got the black one and I think it look quite nice. The quality is good for the price and was easy enough so assemble by myself (some of the screws did give me trouble as I was on my back staring up at the desk. I use the headset hook when not gaming and the storage area was great for any items, gadgets, or manuals you need nearby.I do regret not getting a larger size as I don\u2019t have enough room for another monitor. Instead, I\u2019ll have to find a stand or arm to support the second monitor. I could make room by moving the pc on a wrack under the desk but there wouldn\u2019t be any foot room. There are small support x beams on the legs to help so your can\u2019t stretch your legs in certain ways. So at time it\u2019s not comfortable. The problem might be fixed in the future using a different monitor stand than the one I\u2019m using now.I\u2019d definitely recommend the larger sizes if you have the room. Overall rating for effectiveness 9/10.",

The assembly was difficult in my opinion but I am not great at this sort of stuff lol.The desk is very sturdy and offers lots of room to work with.I had an issue with my desk initially, the holes didn't line up on the final pieces so I contacted their customer support and they were able to send me out a new desk due to the one I received being defective. They were very helpful and probably the easiest customer support I have had to deal with.I would buy this desk again in the future if the need arises.",

Bought for my sewing machine and crafts and fits perfect. Love the side pouch and little table on top as well. All the screw holes were aligned perfect and even xtra scews just in case. What a great purchase for the price !!",
