Assembly isn\u2019t too bad, I made a mistake on the lower shelf being backwards but oh well I can fix later or live with it. Pro tip: open box to carry up pieces if you\u2019re single and live on the 3rd floor walk up. I wish drawers were somehow deeper but it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy!",

                "reviewText": "This desk was so easy to assemble I probably could\u2019ve done it without instructions. I read the reviews and it really made me nervous to purchase which made me take a few days to think about it but I\u2019m so happy that I decided to actually buy it because it\u2019s so worth the money. It looks more expensive than it is once you put it together. All of the items were labeled very thoroughly which made it very easy to put together but you could probably put it together just by looking at all the pieces because there are distinguishable traits for each piece that show where they belong. The look is very pretty. I chose the off-white color because it was the only one they had available that was a lighter shade. I originally wanted the bright white one but I took too long to decide to purchase. This white is more like a cream color that almost seems gray. I don\u2019t really think white would be the appropriate description to describe the color of this desk. Overall we are very satisfied with our purchase. The dimensions were exactly accurate to what the description said and it fit perfectly in our space.",

                "reviewText": "So i got this for my daughter s Christmas. It arrived on time however one pc is broken. I reached out to customer service which responded pretty quickly. As the piece that is broken is not so problematic I accepted to get a partial refund and not going into the trouble of waiting for a new pc to come. My daughter was indeed pretty desapointed to see something was broken but at the end of the day she was happy with her new desk and i was too as customer service did steped-up. Anyway, the desk is pretty and seems to be sturdy enough thanks",

Unfortunately, after only a couple of weeks and maybe 3 or 4 uses, the edge closest to the chair is already starting to show signs of wear in the finish. I know it's not \"fine furniture,\" but I did expect better quality than this. Other than the finish wearing off quickly, the desk seems sturdy and it looks very nice. The drawers roll smoothly and are roomy.",

                "reviewText": "Do NOT purchase this item!! First of all, I ordered this and it arrived late. The box was open and had several places that were ripped apart. Once opened, there were at least 3 parts that had been busted in transit (I stopped unpacking after that). Not the seller's fault but FedEx's. To their credit, the seller sent me a replacement for free. Upon receipt of the second desk, I found it to be in good condition, but NONE of the hardware was worth the cost. There are multiple pieces that still \"wiggle\" after being tightened down as tight as they will go. And the instructions were missing 3-4 steps. Had I not put together several items from Sauder, I would have never figured out how to put this desk together. I'm keeping it bc I don't want to deal with the company any longer and the desk is for a 7 year old. But buyer should beware. It's a crappy product for the price!!Edit...Ive now had to start using wood glue to hold the drawers together. Do not purchase from this seller!",
