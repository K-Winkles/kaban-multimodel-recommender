                "reviewText": "I've never bought a gaming desk before, so I figured this would be an interesting adventure. I eventually settled on this one, and so far, so good. Thoughts and observations below:- The desk is pretty heavy, which was honestly reassuring. Heavy means it doesn't feel cheap, and it feels like it won't fall apart from a stiff breeze. If you picked up this desk and dropped it for some reason, it would probably go very badly for you. Do note, however, that it's two halves instead of one solid piece. Obviously, this means there will be a small gap in the middle of the desk. It doesn't bother me at all, but it's something to consider if you think it will bother you.- Assembling the desk itself is a breeze. I'm about as smart as the average victim of a slasher film when it comes to putting things together, and I would go as far as to say that I put it together relatively quickly. If I can do it, anybody can.- It's plenty roomy. It's holding my three monitor Frankenstein setup (the largest one is 28\") with room to spare, which is exactly what I wanted in the desk in the first place.- It feels very sturdy. The desk seems fairly indifferent to my attempts at bumping it. Maybe my carpet helps mitigate it somewhat, or maybe the desk just knows better. Either way, I have a desk that doesn't wobble.- The corner holes for cable management are extremely helpful. My cables are managed in that they are cables, I put them in a place, and they are therefore managed. However, they keep the top of the desk clean. Deception is the key.- I like the mouse pad surface more than I thought I would. My mouse tracks just fine on it. It also doesn't feel cheap. The logo in the bottom right is fine and not too big a deal, and the big dragon on the left is fairly subtle and, depending on how much stuff you put on the desk, might not be something that you even really notice. The surface is apparently waterproof, and while I have not tested that, I'll take their word for it. If the desk upsets me later, I'll spill a drink on it and update my review to let you know how it goes.- The cup holder is...rather large? Larger than I expected, in any case. It does the job, as does the headphone hook.- The gaming handle rack is...fine. It can hold two controllers, but if you use the second one, the handles on said controller will probably limit you to only having two games on the rack. If you don't use the second controller slot, you should have room for four games on the rack. The rack also has four USB 2.0 ports. I made sure mine worked, but otherwise I don't really have a use for that. Your mileage may vary.So all in all, I'm happy with my purchase. If the desk blows up or something, I'll come back and angrily update my review, but otherwise, I'm pleased and I would recommend this to anybody looking for a large, gaming-desk-shaped object.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty sturdy desk, comes with everything you might need and a few accessories. The desk is fairly easy to assemble, it has a simple design and is pretty easy even if you're not used to manual work. It includes all the tools, even a screwdriver which is only used for one or two things.I was able to sit on it and it still seemed steady, so that's a good sign. That being said, I can't guarantee that the capacity is exactly 300+ but it was easily able to support 130+ from my body weight when I was testing stability and seeing if the screws were properly tightened. Cup holder is a bit big, and the mat doesn't fit perfectly, but I didn't really intend to use the gamepad so I can't really leave a review saying I've tested it. I tried putting the mat on, and it was a bit oversized for the cable routing holes but it would still be usable so it really didn't have any functional flaws.The mini controller/charging rack is a nice touch, it also includes a smaller cable you could connect to your PC to make charging gaming accessories and your phone etc. In terms of weight, it's around 70 ish pounds so not too heavy. The good thing about this desk is the legs come fully formed, the only thing you really need to do is attach is to the metal supportive structure underneath the table. This means that if you plan to move this desk with you, it's pretty easy to half disassemble. All you really would have to do is remove the legs and you could transport the legs and tabletop without having to disassemble and reassemble the entire thing. This is a plus, in my opinion.Overall very nice table, especially since these days it can be hard to find a larger table that can support monitor stands and weight at this size, for this price. The top is easy to wipe off, and it includes a variety of gaming accessories that easily add 20-30$ on the value of the table. One might argue they'd prefer the table only, and an option without the accessories, but I found them all to be useful so I did not really have a problem. I would highly recommend, it's a steal, especially if it's on a sale.",

                "reviewText": "It is big and well made. I am afraid of putting the 27\" iMac in the middle or center of the desk to avoid any pressure to the joint. It is because I don't feel safe knowing the fact of two separate particle boards put together to make a solid large top. I don't feel comfortable with that. The plates that hold together the table top are made of thick steel.I don't know if the size plays any role, but the desk is not very sturdy and has a tendency to wobble and shake while typing and doing any work on it.I like the style and color. The included mat covers the entire surface and it is soft. Gets dirty fairly easily.The surface of the desk is like carbon-fiber veneer, but of course that is not real. It is shiny and collects a lot of finger prints. The added Headphone and Cup holder is a very nice touch.When unpacking I saw that 3 different corners of the desk had chunks of laminate broken even with all the great protection around those corners. Makes me think, the manufacturer knew about that, but still packaged and shipped. Putting it together was very easy thanks to clear instructions. Once this thing is put together, I don't think, it would be wise to break it apart while moving. It is due to the particle board. I will try to find a heavier solid wood table top. Will see...",

My previous desk was a tiny work station and completely unsuitable for the job.This desk arrived Thursday and first thing I noticed was how well it was packed for delivery. The desk itself is impressively solid and well made.The instructions were clear, making assembling simple and quick (did the majority alone but needed assistance for the legs only)This desk is spacious and exactly what I was looking for. It also comes with controller stand, full sized muse mat, drink and headset holder. Best desk ever.My only gripe was the price. I had saved this item in my favourites, and noticed at the time I went to purchase it, that there had been a massive jump in price within a few weeks of me looking at it. I had been looking at desks for almost a year and decided to swallow the cost. But intrigued why such a massive jump as almost double in price.",
