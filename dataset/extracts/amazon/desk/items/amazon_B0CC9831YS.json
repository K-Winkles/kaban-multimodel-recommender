                "reviewText": "I need to replace a large L shaped desk with a smaller desk to fit moving into a smaller space in my home. I chose this one because it offered more drawers and a built in printer table that most desks do not. I was losing my separate matching printer stand with the former desk and the former desk had no drawers other then the one on the separate printer stand. This new desk had to fit in a specific area and had to hold everything from the much larger former desk. Here is why it doesn't get 5 stars: In the description it says the desk is adjustable. In the pictures, it shows a version of the desk with the L table clearly to the left of the desk chair. This leads you to believe that the L shaped desk can be assembled with the L table to the right or left of the user. This is not the case. In the instructions, there is no option for changing which side the L shape desk is on. After a few hours of trying to devise a way to do this, I found that the hardware locations on the main desk could not be optioned for the L shaped desk to be to my left as I greatly needed. Even if I would have modified the hardware locations, this would have made the drawer sliders backwards or upside down. The \"adjustable\" description and pictures are a false selling point. I also ran across one joint (part D to part E) that was not drilled all of the way through, but that was a very easy fix. Using a 4mm T handle Allen type wrench will increase the speed of assembly. However, there is some hardware that can only be tightened with the Allen type provided. The instructions say not to use a power tool, but it could be done if you are not a moron and understand to use a very low setting as the box channel framing can easily be crushed. At the end of the day, I did get the desk to fit in the space, but not ideally. The drawers are fabric and the drawer fronts tend to not stay vertical when closed all of the way. This is just a mention if that matters to you, but does not matter in my case because the desk is only seen by me in a private room. I did get everything from the larger desk to have it's place on or in this desk. It's a tight fit, but it is workable and what I needed. After assembly the desk does seem sturdy though it is definitely not a lifetime piece of fine show furniture. However, it is fitting my needs as a very nice temporary station until the house remodel is finished and then I will upgrade to an executive desk. Overall, I am happy that it fits my current needs and the quality seems to be a fit for useability for a number of years.",

                "reviewText": "At 68, I've finally upgraded from using my lap and makeshift dresser as a computer desk. My spouse and I, both retired, found ourselves in the midst of an unexpected move to a much smaller home, and this ADOK L shaped computer desk will fit perfectly in the small den/guest bedroom once we finally move. My son-in-law recently assembled it for me, and said the assembly was easy thanks to clear instructions, all parts clearly labeled, and all necessary tools included. I'm overjoyed with this lovely desk. It's not just sturdy and well-made; it's a perfect solution for all my storage needs with large space and 6-tier fabric drawers. Fabric feels strong and durable, and file drawer design make organizing a joy. I love that it's equipped with 2 USB charging ports and 3 power outlets for all my electronic devices. The desk's height is perfect and comfortable, and the health-friendly monitor stand is a bonus. It's not just functional; it's a beautiful addition to my workspace, and it will look perfect with my white/black office chair I recently purchased. I love it and can't wait to use it once we move and my desk is in place - I will update with pictures. Reasonably priced and great investment. Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4c",

                "reviewText": "I won't lie, this was a LOT of work to put together, not to mention the additional work it took to move everything from my old desk to this new one, but it was so worth it. The instructions were in crystal clear English and all the parts were there, including all the necessary tools. After using an old repurposed IKEA desk for so many years, this thing feels so streamlined. It's less cluttered because there is actually a built-in place to put my dual monitors and printer, and some drawers to put things (my IKEA desk didn't have any of this). My only concern is that the drawers are fabric, similar to those fabric IKEA cubes, and I don't know how well they will hold up over time. For now, though, this is a much better workspace for me in my home office. The only big adjustment is how close I am to my monitors now, as they were set farther back on my old desk, but I'm getting used to it.",
