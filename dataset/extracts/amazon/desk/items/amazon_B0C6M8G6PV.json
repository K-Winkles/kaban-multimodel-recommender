                "reviewText": "I think this desk gives great bang for the buck. The wood is very pretty and just the right amount of thickness. The metal pieces are also thick, well made, and screw together smoothly. Although the directions are not the easiest to follow, a major plus is that they use the same size screw for almost everything. The only slight downside to this desk is that I did not realize the file drawer fits in sideways. To get into my files, I have to take out the whole (light, nicely sized) drawer and put it on top of the desk to sort through it. It's worth the trouble though, to have such a little desk that fits perfectly into my small room. I'm mentioning the downsides because everything is equal or better quality than the product description implies. I also find the whole thing quite attractive.",

The fabric drawers help keep it simple. The paint appears durable. There is some flexibility in the set up. Pay attention to the actual measurements. The desk has a bit less depth than other desks that are 59 inches wide but I like that for my space. I was looking for an unobtrusive desk and this is great for the price.",

Nonetheless, the \u201cwood\u201d like finish on the table was really nice. As is in pictures. Would recommend!!",

Had to return because the drawers could only hold very light things like made a pen! This is what we call bait and switch in America and is completely illegal! So just know if you\u2019re buying this product the drawers are completely useless and tough to open! Completely ridiculous and cheap. Too bad too because had they lined it with even a light plywood and charged another $20.00 it would have been a phenomenal desk! What a shame that this company and Amazon has the need to lie to their customers in order to sell their products!",

                "reviewText": "This item has been with me for a very short time.I decided to order the Maihail Office Desk with 2 Drawers, 59\u201d Desk with Shelves because it perfectly suited my needs for a functional and stylish workspace. The two drawers provide ample storage for all my office supplies, keeping them neatly organized and easily accessible. Plus, the additional shelves on the desk offer extra space to display decorative items or keep reference books within arm's reach. I was particularly drawn to the vintage design of this desk, as it adds character and charm to my home office setup. The sturdy construction ensures its durability over time, and the spacious desktop allows me to spread out my work materials comfortably. Assembling the desk was a breeze thanks to clear instructions and well-packaged parts.I hope you find this review helpful.",
