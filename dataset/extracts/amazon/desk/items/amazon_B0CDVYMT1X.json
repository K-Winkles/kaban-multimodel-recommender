Overall, it's a good desk, don't abuse it as it's not robust and sturdy like your Grandpa's old handmade oak desk, but it functions perfectly. The directions are easy enough to follow. It is just dense powder board, so don't over-torque the screws, just snug and it'll be fine. LEDs are a nice ambiance feature, I don't use them all that often personally, but the surface mounted power strip it probably the most useful thing on this desk; just makes quick access to power easier if you need to charge your phone, plug in a heat gun, charge a drill battery real quick, whatever.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The desk is easy to assemble and is very sturdy, it can be used for many purposes and can withstand heavy objects on top of it. The LED lights are very ambient and bright with changes in color and speed using a controller or through a phone app. The many shelves provide additional room for other items which prevents a cluttering work/play space. Unikito, along with it's customer service, is amongst the best in Amazon in my opinion and are very willing to fix any complaints you should have. Highly recommend buying these desks!",

                "reviewText": "I'm stretching a bit to give this 4 stars, but I'm trying to review it on its own, without comparing it to desks I've bought over the last 40 years. This is my first metal assemble-yourself desk. Assembly was fine. Easy to understand instructions. No missing parts. Just make sure to skip to the Option B instructions if you're doing Option B. (Sometimes instructions will give you different directions for Option A and Option B along the way during the build process. These instructions are separate. If you're doing Option B, skip to the middle of the book to find the start of those separate instructions.) The desk is nice. It's smaller than I imagined. None of my laptops will fit on the top shelf as shown in the photos. My monitor stands barely fit without slipping off the edge, and there's no room to put them on an angle. I like the shelf though, so this is just something I need to work on for my personal setup. I suppose you could call it sturdy/solid. It's not as sturdy/solid as a Bush or Sauder wood desk, it has some wobble. However, it's well built, and I don't think it's ever going to fall apart. The screws hold it together well. It's light, so it's easy to move. The metal is a little thin, if you run into it with your office chair the desk might not take it so well. Don't overtighten the screws or you'll bend the metal. The LEDS work, and I like them.Overall, it's not my favorite desk ever, but I like it enough to have ordered another one. I will put the second one together as Option A, and turn them into one big U-shaped desk, which is what I needed to make this work for 2 complete workstations with multiple monitors and all the accessories.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home and do not generate paperwork so I didn\u2019t need a bunch of drawers or desktop space.It is a smaller size and I had to get used to that, but it fits perfectly in the corner of my office with the side rolling cart next to it to match. The surface is not smooth so writing directly on top is not advised. The leg space difference is only 36\u201dwhile seated so if you like to swivel your legs freely to get up from your chair, you will bang your knees until you find your groove! Lesson learned.The top shelves/ledges are only 7\u201d deep so I have my laptop on a tilted stand and it hangs over an inch on both sides but it\u2019s staying in place. I have two 22\u201d monitors placed at the \u201cV\u201d, but there is some wasted space behind so I put a small subwoofer there\u2026not really wasted. My big desktop cpu fits well on the one side and I added another power strip on the shelf below the desk surface (great footrest shelf too but I\u2019m only 5\u20194\u201d!). The four surface outlets for plugs is great and two USB ports are nice to have for my Bluetooth headphones but the other is needed for the desk gaming lights. No big deal. It\u2019s sturdy and the gaming lights are fun but I just leave one color on and not hooked up to the app. No need for it.I put it together myself with bigger tools than they provide. It took a few hours on a Saturday and I\u2019m overall pleased with it. They provided one additional screw of each type, that was nice.",

                "reviewText": "I am taking more time than I wish to build the desk, but that's my fault. I will update this review when I have assembled the desk and have used it for a while, but at this point I want to emphasize the support I've gotten from Unikito. A screw in one piece didn't go in straight, and I couldn't fix it. I contacted the maker at the emai address in the manual, and after sending address, phone, order number, and photos to confirm which part was at issue, a replacement part will be arriving in about a week.UPDATE: It's finally together, looking good, and more than sturdy enough for my purposes. Things I' learned:If you can at all, assemble it upside down as the manual shows. Not wanting to risk turning it over myself, I assembled it right side up. Mistake. Doing that makes it hard to get all those screws in that connect the desk surface to the frame underneath. I managed, but far better to find someone who can stop by for the minute or two it will take to turn the desk over.The manufacturer means it about waiting to tighten down screws. Live with the wobble until you can get rid of it once and for all.Adequate lighting is your friend when you're looking for screw holes on black metal framework, as well as when you're trying to connect the LED strips to the USB powered device that controls them.",
