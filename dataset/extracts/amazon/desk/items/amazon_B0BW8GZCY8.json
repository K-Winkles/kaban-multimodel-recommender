                "reviewText": "I needed a new desk and this one measured up. I love the outlets, and the overall shape. However, I didn't measure it well in my mind, and it has a few less than ideal aspects that remind you of the price discount.First off, the adhesives for the light strips melted in transit, with two of the clips shattering as well. The strips have let the lights fall off already, and will need replacement.Secondly, the Carbon Fiber surface is incredibly sensitive to the oils of skin, leaving parts looking wet and stained after casual use. It cleans off, but comes back with each use.The last negative is my fault, for not really thinking, but the available desk space feels smaller than normal due to the shelf on top. The legs are spaced in such a way that you really only have about 11 inches of visible desk before the shelf obscures vision and the legs begin to limit the area. Had I really understood this, I might have chosen one a bit bigger.However, it is sleep, sturdy, cheap, stylish to a degree, and it holds my computer stuff. I easily assembled it alone, though they included a second Alan wrench should you have a partner to help with some of the tedious bits. All in all, it took maybe an hour and a half, and I love it for what it is.",

It was heavy for me personally, and at times when building I did need an extra hand but that\u2019s just me. The lights work great. I really hope this lasts me years ahead because it\u2019s truly a great buy. Thank you!",
