                "reviewText": "I've been in the process of building a home office for myself. For the past many months, I've been using a dining room table with my laptop at it, and that's it. I've been searching for a solid desk option that won't break the bank, and will look cool with a gamer aesthetic. It also needed to be large enough for my modest setup, but small enough to fit comfortable in my space. I believe that this overall achieves this.PROSThe L shape is great. I didn't realize just how handy that tiny amount of extra space would come in handy. I have room for my lamp, drinks, I have my surge protector mounted underneath the side part as well, keeping it hidden and out of the way.It was a breeze to assemble. The directions weren't always perfectly clear, but it's easy enough even without the instructions.The look is nice and sleek. Modern, but no too modern.It's sturdier than it looks. I wouldn't want to give it the people's elbow, but it supports my setup just fine.CONSIt's far more shallow than I thought it would be. The desk itself is only about 19\" deep. Having my screens mounted, plus a full size keyboard and a fancy mousepad really uses up every square inch of this.No matter what I tried, it was impossible to get the side piece properly mounted to the main part of the desk.Overall, I believe that if you're looking for a good first use desk, there's far worse desks out there in the budget category. I would recommend this to anyone putting together their first office setup. I plan on replacing this desk with a deeper one in the future, but I'll make sure I get my money's worth out of this desk first.",

                "reviewText": "I have to first acknowledge the packaging of this desk. I was surprised to see the wood top had plastic covers on the edges. I\u2019ve always wondered why manufacturers never did this. I\u2019ve had so many wood product shipped with busted edges since they were not protected.Assembly took about 30 mins, very straight forward and all hardware is nicely labeled. I like the metal frame and the additional cross supports.Desk fits perfectly in the corner of the room. I was able to setup one monitor and my laptop and hub. Not much extra space but I wanted something that would not take up a bunch of room. This desk fit that requirement nicely and even provides a side shelf for books.Tip! Don\u2019t over tighten the bolts that secure the wood top down. I did mine hand snug and there is no movements.I also noticed a bag of \u201cc-clips\u201d and had no idea what these were since they are not in the instructions. Quick search and they are used for cable management on the metal frame and included as a gift.So far I\u2019m completely pleased! This manufacturer took all the steps to ensure a solid product and well packaged!",

I did customize it slightly by using my own bolts to secure the side storage bag on the same side as the L piece, but this was a personal preference.While I agree with other reviewers that I wouldn't use it as a platform for highland dancing, it serves its purpose excellently for my monitor, laptop, and other office supplies. For the price, this desk is a fantastic value and a worthwhile investment for my home office.",
