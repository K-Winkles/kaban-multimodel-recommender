I have had the desk for 1 day, so I can't speak to its quality, but it is sturdy and has a good amount of work space. The desktop came in 2 pieces, but I don't think it will interfere with the use of the desk. The motor operates flawlessly and the controls are easy to use. it seems that this desk is very good quality for the price. -Brendan",

                "reviewText": "Honestly shocked by the great quality for the affordable price. I purchased the small 40\" desk in maple. It was really easy to put together; I did it in 30 min or so by myself including unpacking and clean up. The lowering/raising mechanism works great. The packaging was protective and all parts were in great shape upon unpacking. All holes and parts lined up beautifully. It came with a larger than usual allen wrench for plenty of leverage which made building it very easy. Also came with cable management clips and a small plastic drawer that I wasn't expecting. Very pleased. If you're looking for an adjustable desk around this price point, I recommend this one for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home and sitting on my butt all day is not the way I want to spend my life. I got this to help me be up more than down for the day and I wanted to see if it could help me change my life.Setup:-Putting it together took a little bit of time. I did it myself with the easy to follow directions. It maybe took an hour and that's with me kinda moving a little slow (I was tired but excited).Pros:-I absolutely LOVE being able to stand when I work. I'm 5'2 so I wasn't worried about the height not being tall enough for me. I preset my sitting and standing number and it's so easy to flip between the two with ease and with speed.-My butt doesn't hurt from sitting all day. In fact, I stand more than I sit now which makes me feel healthier and makes my body feel better!-The desk shifting up and down is actually pretty quiet. It doesn't disturb my calls and moves quickly enough so that I'm not just sitting there waiting for it to get to the height I set it for.-The look of the desk top is very nice and aesthetically pleasing for me.-It's not bulky but it still fits my two monitors, my keyboard, mouse, my large water bottle, and anything else I need!Cons:-It feels a little wobbly sometimes. I retightened everything because I've been using this desk for quite a few months and figure some of that is just from using it CONSTANTLY. It is a little on the lighter side though so I wouldn't recommend putting a whole ton of weight on it.All in all, if you're looking for a standing desk that is quiet, easily transitions, looks nice, and can fit all your things for work or school, this is it! I LOOOVE mine and only took a star off due to the lack of sturdiness that I experience with it. It's not a bad lack of sturdiness. It just makes me a little weary to put my body weight on it so I don't lean on it or anything.",

                "reviewText": "The instructions were clear. Assembly took 20 mins. Whole table is sturdy both when elevated or not. There are adjusters on both legs, which can be useful if your hardwood is wonky. The construction material is solid. I have been using it for a month now. The adjustment mechanism works fine. There are 4 modes which can be set acc to your preference. Right now I got two monitor screens, two studio monitors, MacBook stand and other i/o peripherals and they all sit well on the table and don\u2019t wobble when moving up and down. The cable management is really easily. I would recommend, getting an extension cord and just attach every power cable to it, place the extension on the wire shelf, such that the only wire hanging to the wall outlet would be the extension cord\u2019s cable, which can be hide by using a wire sleeve or vertebrae. Lastly , I ordered the rustic brown and it looks really good.",
