                "reviewText": "I work from home, and I don\u2019t have a ton of space so needed something compact. I stumbled across this beauty and decided to give it a shot. It arrived in 2 days so delivery was fast, and it was packed well. I was expecting it to take quite a while to put it together, but even assembly wasn\u2019t too bad. Everything was clearly marked and even the alan wrenches and screwdriver needed to assemble it were provided. I used my own ratchet driver just to make things go a bit faster. As a moderately handy woman, after going through and making sure all pieces were there, it only took me about 45-50 minutes to put together by myself. Would have been probably about half the time with a drill though.It is very sturdy which was a concern since you never know when you buy things off Amazon. It looks great in the space and fits my 2 monitors and laptop as seen in the pic. The plug on it is a nice touch as well. Overall very satisfied. I\u2019d recommend this desk.",
