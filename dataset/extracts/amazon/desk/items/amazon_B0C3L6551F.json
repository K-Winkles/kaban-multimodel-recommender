Plus it has that extra top and LED . My son loves it. Great gaming desk definitely recommend, wasn't to bad to put together just wish directions didn't just show pics but maybe said how it goes, we had one part turned the wrong way and had to go back and undo alot to fix it.",

                "reviewText": "The table surface, the elevated shelf, and the AC + USB power outlets are a very good combination for a secondary computer work area (no gaming) in a bedroom where I can hide from my active cat who craves physical human attention. The monitor is on an arm clamped to the shelf, which holds the monitor at the right height to be just above the laptop screen tilted at a good angle. Dual USB power jacks power a lightbar atop the monitor and a Fire TV dongle plugged into the back of the monitor. I like the configuration!This comes in kit form and it was very easy to assemble, though it took over an hour because of having many pieces. Really good instructions and packaging to support assembly.Others may appreciate the \"gamer\" aesthetics including a LED strip with adjustable color that goes under the shelf and the \"carbon fiber\" appearance. Those features increase the selling price but do not add any value for my applications.",

LED lights work well and have had zero issues with them. My only issue is that the raised platform is a little small for my monitor stands, and if i have my arms on the desk and move, my monitors rock back at forth. So i think the upper platform could use a little bit of additional reinforcement. Otherwise i really like this desk. I wont be getting rid of it anytime soon. Well worth the price.",
