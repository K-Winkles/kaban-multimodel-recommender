It was very easy to assemble and surprisingly pretty stable. The wheels work, too. The height is adjustable. The desk takes up almost no space. And there is plenty of room on the surface of the desk. When my husband wants to work, we roll up the desk and place it in front of his chair and he can place his laptop, his phone, a drink, and his paperwork on his desk. Sometimes he uses it to eat on it too. We are very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I had to come back to increase my rating from a 3 to a 4. The size is great, I like the rounded corners, and I like that the height is adjustable. The shelves below help with its versatility. However, because the metal is very thin, the top tray seems to start to bend down with the slightest pressure. I would not recommend putting anything really heavy on top of it. The middle shelf could be about 2\" deeper, and it would be nice if the poles which holds the top tray, had some type of plugs in them so the sharp metal edges were covered. The end of the metal frame by the shelves came with plastic plugs in them that had to be trimmed. I'm assuming that the plastic \"peeled\" when the plugs were pressed into the metal to cover the sharp edges. It was an easy fix with an exacto knife. With all that being said, it really is a decent, very versatile product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Boy, am I disappointed. It seemed like the perfect solution for my workspace needs, but unfortunately, it falls short in more ways than one. Let me break it down for you:First off, let's talk about functionality. The desk claims to be suitable for various purposes, but I found it struggling to hold up even a laptop and a textbook without buckling under the weight. It's frustrating when a desk inhibits rolling due to its own lack of stability.Speaking of rolling, the wheels on this thing are a joke. They don't glide smoothly; in fact, they barely roll. Made of hard plastic with no rubber, they make an irritatingly loud noise and are simply too small to offer any real mobility.Now, let's move on to adjustability. The desk boasts the ability to change heights, but let me tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Even at its highest setting, this desk only reaches up to my waist, and I'm just 5'2\" tall. If you plan on using it as a standing desk, forget about it. It falls short, quite literally, and fails to provide adequate height for comfortable standing work.To add insult to injury, the desk also has some serious quality issues. Some of the poles arrived with no caps, leaving sharp edges exposed. Not only is this a safety concern, but it also looks unfinished and poorly constructed. And if that wasn't enough, some of the caps that were included had rough textured surfaces that could potentially cause cuts or scrapes. It's certainly not the kind of attention to detail you'd expect from a product claiming to be durable and reliable.Luckily it was easy to assemble and disassemble-- I was able to put it together leisurely in 20 minutes and take it back apart to return to the seller in about 10.All in all, this adjustable standing desk fails to deliver on its promises. It lacks stability, mobility, and height adjustability. The buckling under weight, ineffective wheels, and limited height range make it a frustrating choice for anyone seeking a functional standing desk solution. Not to mention the quality issues with exposed edges and rough caps, which are simply unacceptable.Save yourself the disappointment and look for a better option (so far I'm liking this one https://amzn.to/43vYlWT with an upgraded of a set of casters) This desk falls short on almost every front, and I cannot recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and versatile workspace solution.",
