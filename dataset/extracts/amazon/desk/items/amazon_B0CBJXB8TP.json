Some of the instructions at the end dont make it very clear which way parts NEED to fit until later when you find out you made a mistake and have to dissemble it. Those two points hinder the assembly process, but they dont make it so unreasonable that you want to hire someone to build it for you.I like to shake my leg and i notice it makes the desk wobble a bit on my carpet, I can only tell since my monitor wobbles. I think this isnt a problem for people who can put the desk right on the wall, but i have baseboards which leave a small gap between the desk and the wall.Overall the desk is very nice and feels much more expensive then it is, I love that you are able to make this desk into an L shape or a long desk.",

                "reviewText": "I received my order a few days ago and as from the start I was concerned because the box it arrived in was really banged up and while getting it into the house two screws fell out which made me wonder if any other parts had fallen out in transport. It started off smooth with me being able to put things together simply enough (although a did have to redo a few steps along the way as I was screwing stuff together backwards and such) but as I got the desk mostly together, I realized I was missing six (6) pieces. the 2 9s which are the circular parts that fix in the holes on the desktop, and the 2 U and V pieces which are used to fuse the shelf part of the desk together.I checked the Assembly Instructions booklet for a contact number, but I didn't find one. I've tried to get assist through Amazon but the only option there giving me is to return the desk and either get a new one delivered or a refund, which is not something I want to do. At least point, I've already destroyed the box it came in (as I like to clean as I go to get stuff out of the way) and I've already got the desk mostly built. To take it apart, find a way to pack up all these pieces in order to send it back, then wait for a new one to arrive just to have to put it together again and hope that this time all the pieces come with it is just a lot of work that I don't feel like going through. I googled the desk and found the company website, but when I go to their contact us section there is no number to call just an email option. I've sent three emails over the last few days and haven't gotten a response.So, at this point I've just decided to deal with it as is. I won't get to put the shelf part up which really sucks, but the open holes on the desktop aren't a big deal to me as I can put wires/cords through. All and all I'd give this all experience a 3 out of 5. The customer service aspect of things has been nonexistent which took away a star and the fact that I can't put up the shelves lost it another one for me as it was a big reason, I chose this particular desk as opposed to many others that would have been a lot cheaper. But, outside of these issues I like the size of the desk and it's really solid and sturdy which I love.UpdateA day or two after I posted my initial review (read above) the company reached out to me through Amazon. I was offered a refund for my desk but for the reasons I listed above I asked for replacement parts instead as opposed to a refund. They were out of stock of parts I was missing in the U.S. and it would take approximately 25 days for them to get them in stock; so, the company offered me a brand-new desk free of charge which I accepted. The desk arrived maybe one or two days later, and I couldn't be happier. I took the defective desk apart and put one half of it in another room in my house. The new desk came with all the parts, and I was able to put it together rather quickly considering I already knew how things were supposed to go from mostly putting the first desk together. Everything looks gorgeous and both desks are really solid and sturdy. Also, because of received I second brand-new desk I got a second strip of LED lights and while I don't really know how to work them through the remotes that came with them, using my phone I am able to control both light strips which I love because it's a lot easier to use my phone as opposed to having to keep up with two small-sized remotes.All in all, I am really happy and certified with my purchase and I appreciate the company for reaching out and correcting my issue.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this desk is very sturdy, big enough for multiple screens and has the sleek look I was looking for. I deducted two stars because the setup wasn't easy (taking nearly 2 hours to put together) and multiple sets of pre-drilled holes did not line up at all. There were missing holes in the framework that I had to manually drill in order to connect the top of the desk to the legs. Before anyone assumes it was put together incorrectly, I can assure that I took the time to take it apart and review the work again. Still nothing lined up. So if you're not that crafty type, I would considered getting something else. But if you are, this desk is worth the money.UPDATE - I was contacted by support regarding my struggles with setup and manufacturing errors and offered a refund for this. Given the extraordinary service, I've added another star and wanted to update this thread. The support team were more than helpful and I'm overall very happy with the outcome.",
