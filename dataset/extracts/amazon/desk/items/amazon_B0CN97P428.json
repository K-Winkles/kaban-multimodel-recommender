                "reviewText": "I cannot tell you how many hours ive spent building, fixing and even trying to DIY remodel the whole desk because I lost track, hell I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow i do it all again... againThe instructions are okaaayyyy they arent terrible but arent the best either it also isnt easy to assemble on your own you could possibly do it by yourself but if it took me 2 - 3 hours (just the first attempt) to build it with help then I can only imagine solo.Once the desk is complete I dont know if I got a faulty model or something but oh my god it is the wobbliest thing I have ever seen, I notice other reviews saying things like \"really sturdy, can support an entire setup, very sturdy almost no wobble\" So I figured that I did something wrong which commence my 4 day struggle of rearranging, rebuilding and customizingI have tried everything from adding more supports to even removing some unnecessary parts to rebuilding the whole damn thing from square one I refused to blame the desk when others said it was perfect... but no matter how i tried the wobble stayed I manage to bring it down by a lot but enouigh to where I dont fear my monitor falling down",

The table top was damaged, a screw port was pulled out, and the frame bent with the slightest pressure.Once the thing was built, I attempted to do a little typing on my laptop, but the desk wobbled so much that I actual got motion sick and had to move to the dining room table. I can't imagine trusting this desk to hold a PC.I'm now awaiting my refund (which I better receive in full after all that crap...) and don't get me started on what it takes to pack up and return this desk...SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND DON'T PURCHASE IN THE FIRST PLACE.",
