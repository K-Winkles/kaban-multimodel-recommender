                "reviewText": "I recently acquired a new office desk that not only caters to my programming needs but also stands out with its unique design. This desk features an eye-catching two-tone layout on the top, alternating between black and white wood planks, which adds a distinct touch to my workspace.First and foremost, the aesthetic appeal of this desk is a definite highlight. The contrasting black and white wood planks on the desktop create a modern and sophisticated look that instantly caught my attention. It's a refreshing departure from the standard office desk designs and adds a touch of elegance to my workspace.Beyond its striking appearance, the desk has proven to be incredibly functional. As a programmer who relies on multiple monitors for productivity, I need ample space to accommodate my equipment. The desk's generously sized top provides more than enough room for my monitors, keyboard, mouse, and other accessories. The two-tone layout not only looks great but also helps in organizing my work area by visually separating different sections of my setup.Assembly was a breeze, with clear and concise instructions that made putting the desk together a hassle-free experience. This is a significant advantage when you're eager to get your workspace up and running without any unnecessary delays.The desk's sturdiness and build quality are also worth mentioning. It feels solid and well-constructed, assuring me of its durability and ability to withstand the demands of my daily programming tasks. Also, I appreciate that the manufacturer included some nice bumper guards for the sharp corners.In conclusion, this two-tone office desk has been a fantastic addition to my workspace. Its unique design, spacious layout, and ease of assembly make it a standout choice for anyone looking to combine style and functionality in their office setup. Whether you're a programmer like me or simply in search of a desk that adds a touch of modern sophistication to your workspace, this desk is a top-notch choice. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and confident that it will continue to enhance my productivity and overall work experience for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "Sturdy, easy to assemble, and looks good. This desk was worth the investment. Well built and rather quick to assemble when you have parts and pieces organized. A second helper is a bonus to hand you the next parts needed while following the assembly chart, but not necessary. When finished, it felt sturdy and indeed stays sturdy even when you outfit it with whatever desktop items you have. It looks good and is even larger than it seems with great depth so you aren\u2019t forced to be just inches away from your monitors. It comes with clear corner bumpers, but the adhesive seemed old or \u2018melted\u2019 so getting the backs off of the tiny sections in the bumpers was challenging. The bumpers also will come off easily due to their adhesive weakness, but that can be easily remedied with your own double sided tape of some sort if you choose. I would recommend this desk to anyone looking for something worth the price, well built (if you build it right, of course), and fashionable. Be mindful that the underside edge of the tabletop has very little space until you reach the frame, so clamps or modifications relying on some sort of lip edge can be hit or miss. Very happy with this desk. I am confident it will last a very long time no matter what it is used for.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great table. Sturdy, all metal and wood, nothing cheap. No plastic parts, and screws are big and solid.I shot a video that I will edit and update my review with the YT link.Worst part about this table is the number of parts and the time to setup. However, if they used less screws/bolts, it would not be as sturdy. They could have made this table with 1/2 the hardware, but it would not be the same. For example, the part where the left and right half connect, the choose to go with 3 bolts per side, 3 for the left, and 3 for the right, to connect a single side. So, 12 bolts total hold the left and right part of the table together. Most furniture from Ikea would have just used 4 bolts, and it would wiggle, rattle, squeak, etc. The extra hardware makes it solid, but at the cost of longer setup time.If you have power tools and your own Allen wrench sockets, you can do this table in 30-45 mins. You will need a 4mm for the bolts that screw into the wood top, and a 5mm for the metal-to-metal connection bolts. Those are all the tools you need.I would also suggest Gorilla glue in the sliders for each of the legs, I can see those popping out as there is no way to mount them. I consider a wood screw per leg to keep them in, but glue is better I believe.So, look for my update, I will edit my footage of this assembly and hopefully help some folks out. The instructions are not bad, the order of the steps is fine, everything is in English. Just Remember: There are 2 diameter bolts for this, and if confused, check which Allen wrench fits each bolt. The thinner bolts use the 4mm Allen, the metal bolts use the 5mm Allen.",
