                "reviewText": "Good little table. Easy to put together. Sturdy. Using it as a base for a second monitor. My only issue is one of the table legs had one of the assembly holes drilled incorrectly. To best explain this, the hole should have been pre-drilled north and south through the leg, but instead was drilled east to west. I presume these holes aren't drilled manually, rather by a machine, so I have no idea how this could have happened. Anyway, it was nothing a 1/4\" metal drill bit couldn't fix and made a new hole and everything else worked like a charm. Instructions were great and helped a lot to make it faster to put together.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this at 47\" Vintage finish, on sale for $59, and I didn't notice until after that it was only 19\" deep(front to back). That's my mistake for not checking. The product looks amazing. Arrived in perfect shape despite a hole in the box (probably my delivery driver). The table top has a nice smooth finish, all the parts were ready to go and easy to assemble, even if you're alone, although a second person helps a lot though. I decided to keep it because it's a great-looking and space-saving surface to use even if I don't use it for a computer desk. I'm still ambivalent on that, because of one thing-the top piece is rather flexible, even with the included brace underneath of it. All the legs and the brace are hollow aluminum, I believe, as I dented some of them just tightening up screws. It keeps the item very light-weight though, probably less than 20lbs. If I was the seller I would look at a stiffer cross-brace underneath the top. I may add a solid board, personally. Regardless, it's a good desk and a nice fit for a slim area. I would personally recommend this as the L-shape addition or multi-use desk, feels a bit too slim for heavy pc gaming/equipment. Would probably be great for a laptop though, or a one-monitor setup with the tower on the edge over a leg5 stars because despite being kind of flimsy even with the brace, and legs are a bit too easy to bend, desk has a great price (on sale $30 off at least), great appearance, and comes in multiple sizes for different usages.",

                "reviewText": "I was initially apprehensive after reading so many reviews about how the package arrived and the tabletop was marred in some way. Those worries were alleviated the second I opened the box. The corners were protected by plastic caps, as well as cardboard and styrofoam corners. The box was lined with styrofoam on the sides, top, and bottom to protect the table's sides and faces. I think they'd have to try to damage this thing.The instructions for assembly were short, visually demonstrative, and simple, and assembly took maybe five or ten minutes. One thing I did NOT see while looking up this table is that there is a metal bar running across the length of the table underneath it, which is what makes it sturdy. That gives me much more confidence in this thing, though I can see how that confidence can be stretched if one gets a longer table than 48inches.Speaking of how long it is, it is indeed not accurate with regards to width and depth - it's an inch or so short both ways. This is odd, because you'd think this is one of the least fussy things to get right dimensionally, but the inaccuracy doesn't affect my use of it at all.I have not had the table long, but it seems great for its price point ($60 plus a 10% coupon). It can rack side to side a bit if you're using it to do crafts on, but otherwise very sturdy.",

The color and materials of this product go very well with the existing furniture. My original desk now appears to be L-shaped. I have just the right amount of workspace that I needed. Please note that assembly took about 45 minutes for me and my husband, which also includes the time it took to read the directions in advance, and to account for the items in the box.
