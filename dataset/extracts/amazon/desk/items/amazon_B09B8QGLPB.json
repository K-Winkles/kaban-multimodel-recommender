This desk is not just a piece of furniture; it's a statement of style and functionality that caters to both aesthetics and the practical needs of a gamer.The inclusion of power outlets is a game-changer. The convenience of having built-in electrical outlets right on the desk eliminates the need for messy extension cords and ensures that all my gaming peripherals and devices are easily powered up. It's a thoughtful feature that speaks to the practical needs of a modern gamer.Assembly was surprisingly straightforward, thanks to clear instructions and well-labeled parts. The sturdiness of the desk once assembled instills confidence that it will withstand the rigors of daily use.If you're looking to upgrade your gaming space with a desk that stands out, provides ample power, and keeps everything organized, I highly recommend this pink gaming desk. It's a delightful addition to any gaming enthusiast's room!",

Not much storage at all, keep that in mind. And the workspace is narrow - I got a desk extender that works perfectly for my arms.",

If he was young and rough, I\u2019d be worried but he\u2019s 17, and using it for his xbox. It\u2019s a cool desk and the lights are a nice bonus and one of the reasons he picked it. No complaints.",

Great price Unfortunately - one of the two desks was little bit damaged on a corner of the table top when it came - though that side could be turned to the wall and almost completely hidden. The other desk was perfect. I sent an email given in the instructions to Bestier customer support. They responded within a half day. After requesting photos, they offerred various solutions, kept communicating regularly, and long story short, they backed up their product and took care of it. Happy owner of two great desks for not a lot of money. If not for the very slight damage on one of them, totally 5 stars",

This product's color and style matched what I was going for in the spare bedroom. I took a chance because it wasn't super expensive. It took me less than an hour to build, instructions are easy to follow for assembly and the desk has a lot more leg space than I expected compared to another desk I purchased from Amazon for my home office. This desk is high enough for you to have any small office chairs to their highest setting and still have more than enough space. (perfect for shorter and taller persons) I only rated the sturdiness as 4 stars only because this is a lighter weight product so is much easier to move on your own but, other than that, I'm going to keep it! I'd definitely buy again!",

I assembled it by myself with 30min. Despite some markings in the pattern that somewhat resemble scratch marks, the gray looks sleek and modern. The shelves are adjustable and are perfect for organization and saving space on the desk. The led light strip is such a cool touch. It offers a variety of colors and modes for alternating and blinking color lights. My daughter loves the desk. I highly recommended and would definitely purchase this desk in the future should the need arise again.",
