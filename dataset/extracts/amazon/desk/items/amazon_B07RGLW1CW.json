                "reviewText": "IN LOVE with this desk! I put it together alone (I'm a 5'3\" 160 lb female) in roughly 30 minutes with a little help from other furniture in the room to prop up the legs while I added the crossbeam and a box to support the shelf while I screwed it to the frame. I haven't USED it yet, as I need help putting it in place, and since I work from home (starting in about an hour) I need to take my time when relocating my computers, modem, etc, but I'll update again tomorrow if I'm allowed to do that!The design is perfect - the legs require no assembly, and with the 3 crossbeams in each leg, I don't think it's going to allow for much wiggle! The desktop is GORGEOUS - and almost weighed too much for me to move by myself - yes, it's THAT HEAVY!! If you can, definitely have another person to help you put it together, WHICH is recommended on the instruction sheet. If not, it's doable by one person, as long as you have a bit of strength. Speaking of the instruction sheet - talk about SIMPLE to assemble! You don't need any tools from your toolbox - They included a screwdriver that tightened all 4 types of screws/bolts. Every type of screw and bolt came with 1 extra piece - and they're not cheap aluminum pieces... they are STRONG! I am soooo thrilled with this desk!For the $109+ price tag that I paid for this desk, I have a desk of a quality worth twice that amount! Even if the price goes up, it is worth it! I'm going to look for more to buy from this company because the quality is much higher than you'd expect at this price point, and no, I'm not a paid spokesperson, LOL!!!***24-HOUR UPDATE***I used this desk all day yesterday in my work-from-home job as a medical transcriptionist. The last table I'd used for a desk had my monitor wobbling with just about every keystroke (I guess I hit the keys with some force). This desk stopped that. My screen never moved, unless I bumped the desk HARD. The shelf underneath doesn't interfere with my use of a foot pedal for work, and I stretch my legs out for this, rather than sitting the way one is supposed to for proper ergonomics (knees at 90-degree angles for 8+ hours a day = blood clots!). I'm not sure how it would be for a taller person, but my shins weren't hit by the shelf at all. Still head over heels over this desk!",

                "reviewText": "I've used this desk and the matching file cabinet for over a year. They still look brand new. There's still a gloss on the finish, and no scratches. I'm surprised there's no scratching on either the file cabinet or desk. My desk is near a bright sunny window, and my two cat's take turns sitting on both. After two cats jumping on and off to look outside the window, both items are in brand new condition. There's no fading in color, since it's near a bright window and sun hits it sometimes. The file cabinet is used daily and glides open without any problems. Also, there's no sagging with the desk. I like the basic design, however, I would have preferred no shelf underneath the desk. It sometimes gets in the way of arranging the many cables. It also makes it impossible to put the file cabinet under the desk, to save room. The shelf adds extra stability, so I think it's needed. I originally ordered the smaller desk, (47\"). It didn't exactly match the file cabinet, and was too small for me. I ended up purchasing the 55\" desk. It was a perfect match with the file cabinet. I was a little concerned since the larger desk was purchase separate at a different time from the file. I highly recommend for the price and color (oak), and design. It arrived packaged without any bad materials, (as someone mentioned) and in excellent condition.",

                "reviewText": "To begin with, I am 6'5\", and just under 300lbs. My search for a desk that would not only support my computers and work environment, but also to provide an aesthetically pleasing addition to my office. I'll get back to that shortly.Easy assembly. The addition of the shelf was a nice touch. It provides added overflow space. I was running dual 32\" monitors, and had room for my primary notebook on the desk. Keyboard, mouse, phone charger. And I still have room to work. With my configuration, there is enough room to me to review contracts and other docs, and stay organized. And with all this equipment, the desk is quite sturdy. The width of the wood is great, and provides a feeling of confidence in the weight that I am placing on this desk. It does not rock back and forth, nor feel \"loose\" in any form or fashion. It is high enough for me to use comfortably as a big and tall person, and has no issues when I'm leaning on the desktop. There is not a category for big and tall desks, but this works not only for me, but my under 6' wife as well.The color of the reclaimed wood is on the darker scale, but not as dark as walnut. It's soothing to see from a day to day perspective. I went with this wood and black to help with a minimalist approach to this workspace. This is where this desk exceeds expectations.Work can be chaotic at times. I have learned and have started to share the concepts of a minimalist approach to the work environment, keeping those things that are needed available, not not strown across the surface. Herein is the beauty of the added shelf. A drawer becomes a place of clutter, whereas the box on the shelf holds only those things that are used on a regular basis. (When was the last time you needed a staple remover?). It's clean and streamlined. The result is a peaceful environment in which to function.I have had 4 other desks - a gaming computer desk, managerial style with filing cabinets as drawers on each side, and a simple glass top. This is my fourth and final one.I will ask the manufacturer or seller a question or two about an item sometimes to insure that if something happens, they would respond. I did just that prior to the order, and the seller responded quickly and professionally.Thank you for taking your time to read this review. Have a great day and be safe.",

Very clear assembly instructions and each labelled package of screws included a spare piece. I appreciate that because sometimes knock-down furniture makers use inferior hardware that can break but these were good quality pieces. The finished wood and matte metal legs are in perfect condition. Holes were predrilled and lined up, and I easily assembled this by myself. FYI the desk delivered in the box is heavy (60 lbs => 27kg). Very good value, perfect size, handy shelf, and no regrets about buying.",

When putting this desk together it suggests 2 people which although I did it myself with no issues because I had tools that I used as a second person to hold items level. Took about 30 minutes to assemble Lots of space for the computer tower on top of the desk along with 2 24\" monitors and keyboard and mouse. Also, this desk is very sturdy and has a nice finish and a large enough hole for lots of cords to pass through to the power bar. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DESK TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.",
