I think the red details are cute. It seems to hold weight just fine. The size was perfect, I was worried it would be too big for my space but it fit perfectly. I think the height of the desk is nice, too. It works with a regular chair if you don\u2019t have an adjustable desk chair. The box came with a rip but I didn\u2019t think it damaged anything with all the plastic. When I started assembling, I noticed it did rip through the plastic on the top shelf and damaged it. I haven\u2019t attached the shelf yet, the damage didn\u2019t ruin it entirely. Overall it\u2019s a nice desk for a fair price.",

I am very happy with the product, it has been about two months since I bought it, and I do not regret it. The desk is very firm and not shaky at all. It is also very spacious, and you can adjust the additional space to whichever side you want. The only flaw I experienced is that it tends to quickly get a little dirty, and the marks from your hands can be a little evident. But it is not a huge problem, nothing a wipe cannot solve. But overall, definitely worth it, especially if you would like to study with notebooks and a laptop at the same time.",

Price was really good for a desk like this. The color is cute and may buy a second in the future. Suits my neednfor more space to work with on a desk. Picture isn't my full setup. Only one con I'd say the little riser thing that goes above the top and is used for monitors. Has nonset holes to screw it into thus making it hard to install. I think when I knownwhere I want it I'll drill holes under the deck for it. Otherwise the screws are just supposed to tighten there I assume, making it not as stable.",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with this pink table!!! I am a content creator and about to start my journey of live streaming and needed something roomy and cute. As a college student I am on a budget so I needed to also find something affordable and wow this table was definitely priced super reasonable. I was actually surprised the price wasn\u2019t higher since this table is extraordinary! When I say it\u2019s perfect I really mean this table is perfect! It was easy to assemble and only took about 1 hour and a half with the help of my grandfather. It\u2019s the perfect size and is super roomy. I can fit my laptop and monitor on it and still have room for way more. I love that it comes with an extra shelf to put where ever you please. You do not need to drill it, it\u2019s one of those that you can screw down tight to the table and then unscrew and move to a new desired spot without having to make holes in your brand new table! The table itself is super smooth and it\u2019s very durable. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this table for any gamer girls out there looking for a pink table or people who are looking for a roomy table that holds all their tech stuff. This is definitely the best fit for someone who spends a lot of time at their desk and needs room for more than just a computer and a keyboard. You have room to write down things on one side, type in the middle and a whole other side to do whatever. Highly recommend!!!! Seriously cannot beat this deal for the price!!! It\u2019s perfect for me as a tall woman I have tons of leg room. I am 5\u20198ft 1/2inch and have tons of leg room! I added a power strip extension cord outlet holder to my table to keep the cords and the plugs off the floor and be more organized this way. There is so much you can do with this table and I love that I didn\u2019t have to pay a fortune to get an extremely high quality product.",
