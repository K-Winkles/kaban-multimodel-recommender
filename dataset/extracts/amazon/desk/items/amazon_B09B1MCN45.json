                "reviewText": "I purchased this to place in my bedroom as a backup desk for remote work. I needed something that was compact yet had enough workspace to be useful. This works perfect. I was able to place it between 2 dressers and the space I was looking for. I am able to place my laptop on the top and still have plenty of workable space for taking notes and such. It was really easy to put together and came with everything I needed. No need for extra tools. The only thing I would add is that if you have a cat who likes jumping, you may want to keep it at the lowest height. The height is adjustable, which I love, however I have a fat cat who likes to jump and when he does, the desk is not sturdy enough to hold that weight. That is the only reason for the 3 stars on the sturdiness. I realize not all folks purchasing have a fat cat who will jump but if you do, just be aware:) I would purchase again. Great value for the $$.",

That only took about an hour. I am using the rollers to move it from room to room easily. Great find! I recommend it.--",

Since they don't, I am still ok to keep it. I used it as my printer desk at home. This serves me (& looks) better than just a mobile printer rack. I wheel it around for different users - dining hall, bedroom, study room - that need to print (using wifi) and if unused, wheel it back into the 'utility' room. Good functionality though I wonder if my Brother printer is slightly too heavy.",
