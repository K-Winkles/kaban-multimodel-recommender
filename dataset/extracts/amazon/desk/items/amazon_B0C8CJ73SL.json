I\u2019m going to try a pillow. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took me 4 hours to put together and almost the whole thing you have to use an allen key for.",

                "reviewText": "To say I shopped a lot of sites and desk configurations for my new desk would be an understatement. I finally settled on this one as it had some key features that I liked with my old desk. The Keyboard drawer is great, but like other reviewers, it is a little too small, so I'm getting a new keyboard in hopes of fixing that issue. Also in my picture I tried to put my printer in the spot I had envisioned for it, but after working at the desk for a bit moved it off as it just didn't fit and took up too much usable space. I love that I'm able to now have 3 monitors, which my old desk didn't support, and it opens up my office space so much more than my old bulkier desk. The drawers are also a key feature that I'm enjoying as well. So many desks are so minimal these days, I wonder where do you keep your \"stuff\"??? My 15 year old son built the desk for me, and like other reviewers it took a few hours. All in all This is a great purchase and I'm enjoying my new desk!",
