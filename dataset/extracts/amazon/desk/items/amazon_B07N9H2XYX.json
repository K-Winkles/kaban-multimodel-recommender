The assembly directions were mostly clear and concise. It is extremely heavy. I opened the package where it was delivered inside my door, removed all the pieces from the carton into the room I planned to use it, and that's where I assembled it. I would never have been able to move it on my own across a carpeted floor. I did attach some felt floor savers under the legs so it wouldn't scratch up my wood floor, and they make it easier to move it around in my office.",

Ease of installation, quality, craftsmanship and features makes this 9/10 product. However, if you like EXTREMELY simple installation, this may fall outside your preference.

                "reviewText": "I Love this desk. The color is exactly what I wanted. It's more sturdy and heavier than I was expecting, but that's just what you want in a desk. For the most part one person can put it together. However, you definitely need two people for just one step when you're putting the top onto the legs. I tried by myself and ended up breaking it where the screws insert, and had to use super glue with the screws to add extra support. But everything else can be done with just one person.I highly recommend this desk.",

                "reviewText": "I like the desk, it suits my needs, isn't crazy good wow but is probably good enough for an entry level desk. You get what you pay for, and it's decent for most people. Something important to note is that the hole for the wires will not fit adapter blocks because it is too small, in case you want to slip a charger wire through the back.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this desk for my daughter to work at. I was honestly a little scared due to the reviews that I read, however, even with the pictures posted of people who had problems, it looked like one that I could adapt or fix if needed. Ordered it, and it arrived via UPS, when I went on the porch to get it noticed a hole in the exterior box. Upon opening it I found that the interior boxes were still in tact. Took everything out and inspected each piece, and there wasn't any damage. Counted all the pieces, and components and they were all there. This process took me about 15 minutes.I then set to work setting it up, and timed myself. The instructions made sense, and followed their flow, it took me about 45 minutes to set it up and it was sturdy with no gaps or loose pieces. You will want to use a hand driven philips screw driver rather than any power tools. Also when assembling the side pieces I found it easier to assemble them flat on the ground with the legs at the side.Overall, for a assemble by cams and dowels furniture it is pretty good. If I need another one of this size I would purchase it again.",
