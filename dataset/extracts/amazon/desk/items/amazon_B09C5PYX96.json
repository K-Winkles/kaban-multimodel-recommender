It is really convenient as it has enough surfaces to hold a laptop, store accessories, notebooks etc. At the end of the work day I can put away all this things and clear out my main space for other activities. I personally wouldn\u2019t use it as a main work station for long hours, but it\u2019s great as an additional working surface with a lot of mobility.The construction is sturdy, assembly is somewhat easy, but it is easy to mess up with the drawer. Mine would only come out half way after assembly and seems impossible to take out fully now. I think one needs to be careful installing the drawer to avoid this.",

                "reviewText": "We've had this desk a bit over a year now. After a few months one of the casters broke off, my husband is super handy and found a way to fix it, few months later 2nd caster broke off, again he fixed. Over the last few months the last two broke and now all four have had to be fixed. This is an issue with the metal bars on the base. The metal is not strong enough for the casters, it bends and causes the casters to eventually break.If you have light us you are probably good, but I use this nearly every day and move it back and forth in front of my chair in the bedroom. The desk top, the drawer and the shelf are awesome. I love having everything right here when I'm not in my office at my full size desk.The other pieces are great and I've loved this.Unlike others we had no issue putting this together, but again, my husband is able to do that type of work.",
