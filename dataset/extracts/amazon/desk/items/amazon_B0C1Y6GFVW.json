The only think I wish were different is the top shelf was winder it makes it difficult for larger computer monitors to sit up there.",

                "reviewText": "So for starters, the package arrived in good condition. Assembly at first was quite easy, I was able to put the metal frame together in about 20 minutes by myself.The issue came with the wood top. First of all, the wooden pegs that hold the 3 seperate wooden pieces together are not hardware. They are a stain on the furniture assembly community. It is impossible to use those wooden pegs and not have a gap. No matter you do, you will have a gap.Next, after considering jumping out a window after finally getting the wooden desk top on the metal frame we discovered that they drilled the holes on the WRONG SIDE to connect the top wooden part that allows you to elevate your monitor. Which meant that instead of having 8 secure screws securing the elevation part of the desk, we have 3 that were property drilled.And before you ask, \u201cmaybe you had it flipped around\u201d no, if we flipped it so that the elevation holes lined up, we would be unable to attach the metal frame due to the hidden screw holes. We also would have had to drill NEW holes for the god forsaken wooden pegs to fit.All in all, manufacturing error aside, it\u2019s a nice sturdy desk. It\u2019s spacious and the LED RGB lights add a nice touch and are scientifically proven to increase your FPS rate.My main grievance is whoever decided that wooden pegs are some how good replacements for actual hardware. I want them to know the animosity I have for them.",

The instructions had no words except for \u201ctips\u201d on how to assemble. Now I will say this, everything in that box was organized by number or letter! That kinda made up for lack of words but it was fairly easy once I put one of three legs together. After I finish, I go to plug in the LED lights and they didn\u2019t light up or anything within that nature. Going to email now and will come back with an update and with pictures of it working hopefully. Other than that the desk is perfect! It\u2019s works great with my gaming setup.UPDATE:Okay I said it was nice before but omgee the lights on this desk are amazing \ud83d\ude0d not as bright but it should be good enough for no glare. Can\u2019t test that yet bc my monitors haven\u2019t came in but still overall pleased.",

But I will say the instructions for building the desk, while not terrible, aren't great. I wish the instructions were a little better, there's only one spot where I did make a mistake, which in the instructions it does not say \"Do not lift desk after aligning and placing together\" so I snapped off two of the wooden holders inside the desk. It was my error, as common sense would have told me to install the legs before lifting. But unfortunately it isn't said in the instructions.But, I fixed my problem. Like I said, quality of materials isn't the greatest. But regardless, the product is good for its price. Maybe just improve the instructions ever so slightly as it's not bad there's just some spots here and there that can be misunderstood or just missed entirely.",
