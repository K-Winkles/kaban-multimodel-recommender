                "reviewText": "Great price for the product. Assembly is very intuitive and can be done alone in under an hour. Prior to purchase, I was most apprehensive about the quality of the wood and the attachment between the metal frame and wood surfaces. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the wood is light and sturdy- nothing like the concrete-like hyper density of the particle board (MDF) used in many products similar to this one. I was even more pleased to see that there are threaded metal receivers embedded into the wood wherever a screw needs to go, meaning there's no need for any sharp fasteners, nor any need to apply pressure during assembly. You only need your fingers and either one of the two allen keys that come in the box. It also makes it much easier to be sure that everything is perfectly aligned and secured. Ultimately, if this looks like it'll fit your needs, it's almost certainly the best quality for the price that you can find.For the sake of adding some details- the main desk surface on the 48 inch version measures 19 and 5/8\" deep. The monitor shelf is 8\" deep, but it extends about an inch further back than the main surface, so it only sits above the back 7\" of the main surface. At the monitor shelf's highest position, it leaves 5 and 3/4\" between the desk surface and the bottom of the shelf, so I personally don't feel cramped by it at all. The main surface is still plenty of space for a full size laptop and plenty of other things.",

                "reviewText": "First, it was very easy to put together. I was able to do it in 15-20 min and I was alone. Quality is what you would expect from an inexpensive desk, so not awful, but not fantastic either. Definitely sturdy enough for a temporary desk.Second, the fabric side piece insert was way too large to fit into the fabric side piece. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, but as you can see in the pictures, the sizing is completely wrong. I called customer support and they told me they would be able to replace the entire product (desk and side piece) if I returned everything, but it\u2019s not worth the hassle of disassembling the desk because it\u2019s only the side piece that\u2019s faulty. I wish I could just get a fabric side piece replacement because it seems like it would be super handy, so I\u2019m a little disappointed that they can\u2019t help with that.I\u2019ll just say that you definitely get what you paid for! I\u2019m just a picky person and kind of upset that this one thing doesn\u2019t work.",

                "reviewText": "This desk is quite light, sturdy, and excellent for most people's home office needs. The top shelf's height is adjustable and perfect for having a monitor at eye level for work or gaming.The thing to watch out for during assembly is the that the compartmentalized bag of screws has numbers in black ink that, due to being printed on a transparent plastic bag with black screws inside it, may not be easy to see. Because of that, I wasn't aware that the bag of screws had labels indicating which type of screw was which, which led to confusion about which type of screw to use in each step. I ended up mistakenly using the wrong screws for holes that were too shallow for them, causing the board I was screwing in for the top shelf to crack. I contacted ODK customer service asking them if they could send me a replacement board to replace the one I had cracked, but they were kind enough to send me a whole replacement desk instead.I highly recommend this desk for its utility and value. To avoid damage during assembly, I recommend looking carefully at the bag of screws inside the box to make sure you're using the right type of screws for each step.",

                "reviewText": "I originally wanted 1 long desk to reach from one end of my wall to the next in my office. But, didn't want to build or spend too much money on it either. My goal was to have a designated area for work and a designated area for personal projects. But, wanted to be able easily roll along.I saw 2 desk/person workspaces but a lot of them had a middle piece you would have to maneuver around. Eventually I realized my best method would be getting 2 of the same desks. But noticed I could run into some of the same problems.I came across these and realized for the price it was worth trying. The 2 desks were cheaper than the 2 desk/person stuff I saw. And, it was even cheaper than some of the single desks I saw.I was skeptical. But, am so happy I decided to go with these! I love them! Sturdy, but I also don't recommend overloading them. But, I have had quite a lot on 1 desk at a time and it holds up. They look nice and cute. They are perfect for what I need, even better than my original idea.",

I have somewhat limited space as well, so finding what I needed was a bit of a challenge.I found desk and was happy with the dimensions (55 inches long) and with the raised monitor shelf. The price was also well within my budget.The desk arrived on time. It was well packaged.Some definite plusses are very clear assembly instructions, and spare screws and an extra Allen wrench. Also, the monitor shelf is adjustable which is a great feature. The hook and pocket that can be attached to the sides of the desk are nice accessories.Assembly time is under an hour, but you really do need two people to put this desk together, especially when attaching the monitor shelf.I find this desk comfortable to work at, and am happy being able to have lots of room to work.",
