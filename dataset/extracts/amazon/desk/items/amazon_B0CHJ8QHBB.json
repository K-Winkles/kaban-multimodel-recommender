This desk allows you two ways to set it up; build A has instructions for those who want the fabric drawers on the left, and build B has instructions for those who want the fabric drawers on the right. There is one mistake in the instruction manual however. I did build A and in step 11 it's instructed to screw in #9 when it's supposed to be #11, and the same is true for build B on step 36; it wasn't a big deal to me since I had already read the reviews that mentioned this. Overall, I am super pleased with both the quality of this desk, as well as how satisfying it was to build and how affordable it was. 10 out of 10!",

Even though some of the pieces were mislabeled and the instructions were a little disorienting (because it can be assembled twodifferent ways) it only took an hour or so to assemble for 2 people. The drawers are fabric (think foldable cubby drawer) and the front looks like pleather but isn't horribly noticeable. We're using it as a vanity for our daughter and it has plenty of space; plus the raised section is good for her perfumes and toiletries. It also feels pretty solid.",

                "reviewText": "My husband was using a table from Costco for his work desk for over a year. He asked for a desk for his birthday last November. So I picked out 3 choices from Amazon and he chose this one. He put it together and loves that his monitors are up higher so his neck doesn\u2019t hurt and there is a charging station built in which is convenient. The only drawback is the drawers are made of cloth material they are not solid so you can only place lightweight items in them. The desk came packaged well and on time.",
