                "reviewText": "I got the smaller of the 2 desks. It was vary easy to build and was relatival sturdy.made out of particle board and solid metal. little shorter than expected but I haven\u2019t necessarily looked at the height before buying. Had extra screws and hardware and really clear instructions for both left and right angle set up\u2026had some minor dents in the wood one right at the front that I could easily rotate to the back but I had already screwed on so not doing that unless it keeps annoying me .was also missing a bag of screws #11 or 1 possibly misplaced them in the mess of plastic protectant but they are not critical to the structure only used to anchor the headphone hooks.great cheap option for an L desk with pretty good finish by cheap I mean less then 300$. Drawers are disappointing similar to pop up fabric baskets with a facing on them prob won\u2019t last long term.led works and the adjustable foot grips are nice. Good in between for minimalist design and need for storage was able to get in the desk. I do like that the side storage could be taken off and used separately in theory like if I didn\u2019t need a desk anymore I would prob keep the side section as a stand.",

Had a less than optimal setup previously using a nightstand as an addition monitor space.I am in a smallish bedroom and work from home, with no actual room for an office. This desk has been perfect for my needs! LOVE that it has 2 bookshelves as I am running out of space for my books. I built this desk with the side to the left, and instructions were easy to follow for me! It is a tad heavy once all built (which is good!, but takes more effort to move for a single person). Overall I am stoked on this desk and the price was awesome too.",
