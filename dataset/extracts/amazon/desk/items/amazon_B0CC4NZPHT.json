                "reviewText": "I love the look of the rustic wood and was looking forward to the drawer feature. That said, when I unboxed it, my first reaction was it felt flimsy. Proceeding forward when attaching the legs, it didn't dawn on me that the screws were breaking through the \"fake wood\" until I flipped it over. I am sure it is fixable but I don't have that furniture repair knowledge to do that. I will be looking for something else much sturdier. I was also suspicious the apparatus that holds my monitors would be able to clamp to the desk. Glad I didn't fully build it to find the monitors couldn't attach. The desk width was also less than my current 40 inch desk. I will make sure to check all of the measurements carefully from now on! Lesson learned.",
