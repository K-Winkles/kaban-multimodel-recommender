                "reviewText": "I was hoping to get a decent deal on this product since the brand I wanted didn't have this style of desk, sadly even at $99 it's barely worth that.First, I opened the package and I'm missing a screw. Luckily I have some I can substitute in.Second issue was the piece that holds the drawer was bent and I had to use pliers to somewhat bend it back.Third is I couldn't tighten the screws into the wood without it bending/cracking the wood.Overall I'm extremely disappointed as this is a gift for my spouse and I'm just hoping he doesn't notice. I am writing this review at the time I'm building it. If I can revise or things get worse/better I will update.Update:Amazon offered $20 credit for the issues. As I progress I'm not sure that was even worth it.The drawer pieces were incorrect and also added a picture showing the gap of the drawer being uneven. Unsure if that's from the material or the bent metal",

It flickers when I touch the wire. The desk looks terrible and if you have a laptop without a separate keyboard, you really can't put the laptop on the desk because there isn't enough room because of the monitor stand/pedestal. Overall, this was a truly a piece of junk to put together and it was crappy just taking the pieces out of the box. Save you money.",

Super happy. It has a drawer that fits a lot plus a bottom shelf for a desktop computer or more storage. It includes a movable console shelf too. This desk has it all. Easy to assemble in about 20 minutes. Strong and durable. Our favorite feature, that we did not originally see, is the lights. The desk has a light with 10 different colors and multiple modes. Super beautiful. It creates a peaceful work environment or you can create a light show when gaming. Ambiance is wonderful. It also includes 2 outlets and 2 USB outlets. Awesome. Super functional. Would definitely highly recommend this high quality and useful desk. Overall, we are giving this fun and strong desk \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f.",

I tend to be able to put things together well enough and this was very frustrating. I only got through step 3 with difficulty until the hex key it came with was stripped and I had to pause. My husband, who is very handy, finished the assembly later and also said it was challenging and the quality was average at best. It isn't easy to install without a second person to hold things in place either. Ultimately the end result is a decent looking, sturdy enough desk with a fun light (remote included). Our daughter was thrilled but it was definitely a frustrating piece to put together.",
