They probably can\u2019t afford one\ud83e\udd2a I was on tiktok scrolling as one does while also peddling and trying to tune out the zoom call I was on and yeah this thing is worth it, my legs are definitely feelin it. You get what you pay for. If you\u2019re expecting more than what you paid for that\u2019s on you not the seller \ud83d\ude17 I\u2019ll definitely lube the pedals a bit because they started squeaking and hopefully that will help maintain it and it won\u2019t break as fast (I read you should do that) if you don\u2019t read and maintain - your fault haha \ud83d\ude06 if you\u2019re on a budget and want to get a little more cardio than you would without it, just get it.I almost gave it 4 stars because of the squeaking after the first use but then I was like wait\u2026 this thing was super cheap what did I expect??It\u2019s light weight like people say but you can 100% get a full motion whoever wrote that comment about their whole family not getting full motion were probably trying to ride it like a real bike or something lmaoIt\u2019s not super sturdy but you\u2019ll figure out where to put it with some time and bloody patience.The display screen is chill, I probably won\u2019t use it though, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be tracking my overall fitness health via this mini bike lol again, this thing is a great piece for extra cardio and movement, it\u2019s not a mountain bike.The knob resistance doesn\u2019t get super tight which at first I was bummed about but then when I started going, after 5 minutes I had to turn it down a little! So I mean until I can fully send it on full resistance I\u2019ll keep that to myself haha",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to get this. I have to have physical therapy; because I'm going to have to have a benign tumor removed from my left leg. So I'm keeping my knees agile while I'm waiting.When I opened the box, the first thing that I noticed was the bolts were just kind of floating loose around the box. In some ways the items looked like some of the parts were new, and some were either returned, or used. No instructions were included.I know on the video it shows where you have to attach the rubber ends to the feet, and they were already on. Also... The screws had been screwed back in to the feet. So I had a bunch of extra bolts that were not necessary.My guess is that the manufacturer just left the screws inside the feet, and then just threw another bag in there. However, the bag was ripped...so they kind of went everywhere. The base of the bike did not have any new plastic on it at, all as well.Once I got it assembled, like other reviewers...it kind of had a jerking movement when you would pedaled it. Every time you went around once, it would jerk. So I adjusted the resistance. Once I did that, it started to pedal smoother. I also adjusted where my feet were on the pedals, and I finally got it to a point where I could go forward, and backwards pretty smoothly. The backwards motion has a little bit of a roughness to it. But the forward's okay.I also found that I really do have to pay attention where I angled your feet when I peddled; because even with small feet like mine, I could feel my heel every now and then...touch the bottom of the floor.I do feel that I finally got it to a point where it's usable. But I personally think I deserve a discount; since they sent me either a returned product, or a used one. Right now it's working okay.It does come with a resistance mat. But that mat is not that strong. I have no carpet on any of my floors, whatsoever. So even when I pedal, I will still get some movement. But it's not as bad, then if it was just sitting on the floor without the little mat. I'm thinking about buying a better, sturdier mat; then what it came with...so it can have more resistance from skidding.I don't think it's worth the price for what I got. Especially since it was used, or returned. I think it's probably worth more in the $35 range. But definitely not the $50.Of course.... The second day I used the bike, I did hear a little bit of squeaking noice. So it definitely isn't made real sturdy. But I think I'm having a little bit better results than some of the other reviewers. I am a little bit disappointed that I didn't get a brand new one. But since I've been able to adjust everything where I have somewhat of a smooth pedal motion, I'm going to see how it works for me.",

I tried adjusting the resistance, but it seemed determined to throw me off course. Needless to say, this bike left me feeling deflated rather than invigorated. I'll have to pump the brakes on recommending this one.",
