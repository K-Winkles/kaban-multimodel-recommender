Both desks have the power choice upgrade. This desk is a strong and sturdy. Most of all looks great. Since I'm a widow mom, it was a little hard for me to put together- my kids helped me. But the instructions where step by step, with pictures. The box is very heavy to move around- but once the desk is put together it is very easy to move from spot to spot. Great desk for the value. If I ever need another desk, I would buy these again. Customer for life!",

                "reviewText": "Let\u2019s start out with the positives:This desk is solid. It has metal framing and the wood is not the cheap particle board type wood that you might find on other build-it-yourself desks. It also did not take too long to build with me and one other person.The cons:I only really have two little negatives about this desk. First, the drawer is a fabric drawer so it\u2019s pretty flimsy. And lastly, the directions are not great. It only really has pictures. I could figure it out but what they don\u2019t really tell you is that you have to put a certain end in a certain spot. So I had to redo a couple of steps.No big deal though. I would buy this desk again. It has a lot of room and it\u2019s the perfect size desk for what I wanted.",

However, the lights that come with it.....they don't stay so wonderful. We went and crazy glued it. Putting it together was ok, but not great. Please read allllll directions before you even start, you will miss something. The price was ok. No real place to put your desk top to get it out of the way other then the floor. The draw that comes with is is made out of a fabric, my son doesn't use it that much. The side compartment is awesome. He puts his iPad that he needs for school in there.,",

The desk seems sturdy. I wish it had a regular drawer, but the description even said it was a fabric drawer. It seems to work well with storing his x-box games and attachments though. The picture on the directions is opposite of what it appears. We ended up putting the shelf on the wrong side when we were putting the desk together, so we had to backtrack and fix the direction, which was annoying. Other than that, I feel like it will hold up for a long time. I feel like we got a great price for this desk considering the quality. My son is very happy with his new desk.",
