Even though the table comes with a screw driver and the spots are marked with dots, I was not strong enough to push the screw in enough for it to be firm, needed a drill for that part.The table is beautiful and very spacious! The motor for height adjustment is quite and efficient. Crazy good value, anything close to this table was over $200 anywhere. Really recommend it!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good enough",
                "reviewText": "Good enough, but definitely needs some improvements. First, shown in the pictures, there are some screw pops from attaching the frame to the desktop. I don\u2019t think I overnighted anything; I could have tightened more, even. But I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t or the screws would\u2019ve popped all the way through. Second, the electronics\u2026you\u2019re supposed to reset the control before using it, so I did. But if you hold the \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d button, depending on what you want, it will stop itself, then go in the opposite direction. To get from standing height to sitting height, I have to lower it in increments because it won\u2019t keep going down; it stops every inch or so. Same with raising the height. This also means that setting a preset height to sit and a preset height to stand doesn\u2019t matter. It won\u2019t go all the way up to that height or all the way down to the other height without stopping itself. And no, there are no obstacles in the way; I have it in the middle of the room. Next, do not let the cable grommets pop out of the desk. You will not get them back in the right way, and they WILL break easily. Both of mine broke within 5 minutes of trying to get my cables managed after setting everything up. Last, there are extra screws. Some have 1 extra, some have 4 extra; there are 3M strips that AREN\u2019T the cable management, but the directions don\u2019t say what they are. So plan to have extra things without explanation for some reason.Overall, it\u2019s good enough for what I need, but could definitely be better.",

You can do it by yourself but having someone to help does make it easier. Motor raises desk pretty quickly. It\u2019s a pretty stout desk, has a slight wobble but overall it\u2019s really sturdy. I was having issues picking out a desk. The desk this cheap on Amazon scared me away, but I saw someone who recently bought one and it seemed decent, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try. I\u2019m not disappointed at all. As far as the black square on front top of desk, I just bought a desk mat mouse pad and it looks great.",
