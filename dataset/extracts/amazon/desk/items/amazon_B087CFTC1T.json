As for the desk itself, it is perfect for my small room. Assembly was quite easy - and I don't consider myself extremely handy. Instructions were clear and every part and bag is labeled. The materials and glass feel sturdy. Took me about 30 minutes to put together.The attached picture is meant to show how much I was able to fit on this. From L to R: Speaker system, 21.5\" iMac, Dell DVI monitor, Samsung HD / VGA 25\" monitor, standard 13\" Lenovo laptop with docking station. Plus there is plenty of room for other accessories: 2 keyboards, 2 mice, external hard drive, ETC.The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c the package arrived later than I was told. To be fair, I do not know if that falls on Amazon Prime shipping, the seller, or UPS. Had it arrived on the day promised, it would be 5 stars.",
