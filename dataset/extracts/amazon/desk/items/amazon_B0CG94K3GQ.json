                "reviewText": "After having to return the item that was not a desk, i went through Amazon customer service and ordered a replacement for free with free shipping. The desk arrived a day early and I spent several hours putting it together because i did 99% of the work myself. Instructions are pretty clear if you're paying attention - which i was not. The composite wood is very nice, flexible when trying to put the desk together and the metal framing is very solid. I am happy to finally have an l-desk back and having the room i was hoping for. I got the larger desk as i knew i had just enough room to fit it in my corner of the master bedroom. The platform where the PC sits on is really nice, makes it much easier to move my PC around when rearranging and i am happy it has plastic sliders that screw into it.After all of the painstaking time of waiting for the correct item to arrive - i am overall pleased with the amount of storage, the sturdiness and overall look of this l-desk, and recommend it to people due to it's extremely affordable price. Who knows, i might make my company buy me the shorter one for when i move offices at this price and ease of putting together if you have more than one person doing it.Good job. :)",

                "reviewText": "I love my desk! It was a great investment! I have to say the manufacturer\u2019s assembly instructions are the best I've seen! They recommend two people to assemble due to the layout and amount of pieces and parts. I am not a handy person, so taking this project on solo was ambitious but DOABLE because of the instructions! The desk is roomy and for the most part, fits together perfectly! I love the fabric drawers\u2014and the amount of space they offer. The color was spot-on gray. And the power cord is wonderful! Shipping was on time too.I recommend this purchase for the aesthetic and quality, functionality, and price! Best of all I didn't have to wait for my husband to put it together. \ud83d\udc4f Also, there's a QR code for the desk assembly!",
