                "reviewText": "Me and my 14-yr old daughter (who likes to assemble furniture) put this together for my older sophomore. We all love it. All parts were labeled. It is so easy to put it together in about an hour. I like the fact that one side is a metal frame that's still sturdy making the table light to move. I don't like wood all over. So if you were to place in a big hall like in one of the videos, it's an open design. Beautiful design this!. One side is 2 shelves and at right angle the 3 shelves which is an elegant design. Table top is a smooth wood and so deep it fits a lot of stuff, as you can see. It's a college going kid's desk. Desk height is standard and we bought the chair afterward and it's at perfect height. The desk does not shake even a bit one you write. Got this after a lot of searching this and that. Love my choice!",

                "reviewText": "I put this together by myself and it took about 1-1 & 1/2 hours total to do. The directions were clear enough, had to redo a few things a couple of times because I didn't pay attention to where the holes were for later.....got to the last few steps and 2-3 holes were absolutely misaligned and that was manufacturing error. However, despite missing 2 screws altogether (that I just couldn't get, no matter how much I pushed/pulled) this desk is still sturdy and looks great. Some previous reviews said they got a white desk top instead of the wooden one, which worried me a little, but I decided it didn't really matter either way in the end because I still liked the style. I did end up getting the all oak color top though. I'm happy with the way things turned out and it even arrived early. Nice addition to my home office.",

The directions were not very clear as there were no words and also no indication of what tools would be needed (FYI: you\u2019ll need a Phillips screwdriver and a wrench, which were not included, along with the Alan key provided). Mostly good but the top doesn\u2019t seem super stable even after tightening screws as much as possible. Overall it fits the look I was going for but I wish the instructions were a bit more clear for those who are inexperienced with building their own furniture.",

The result is a nice sturdy and stable desk and he is very happy with it.Very spacious and the extra shelves are really nice.We love that part of this desk is metal. It is quite heavy (we needed 2 people to bring the box in).Instructions were clear, all the pieces were marked with small stickers. Box had a little dent in it, but all the pieces were packed nicely and securely, so it didn't affect the desk.Would definitely order again.",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely thrilled with the style and functionality of this computer desk. The table part of this desk is spacious enough to fit desk organizers, papers, books and other things all at the same time. The storage shelves are definitely a plus, as they can fit a variety of extra items that you don't want to store on top of the desk itself but still want to have within reach. This computer desk offers a nice work area for children doing school work, writers crafting masterpieces, artists perfecting their artwork or just the average person who wants to sit down and have an organized space to work in.This desk was simple to put together and stands extremely strong. I also like that it offers a lot of room but doesn't take up a huge space in my living room. Another plus is that it complements any home decor including modern, farmhouse, rustic. Would recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 08/06/2021: After fighting through contacting everyone I could find related to the order, I was finally promised a full refund of the item on 08/04. I patiently waited to give them the benefit of the doubt, but received no refunds to any of my payment options or my gift card balance roughly three days later. Additionally, the message regarding the refund also clearly stated \"you do not need to reply to this email,\" leading me to believe it was sent from a group mailbox or was just an auto-reply. I finally went to Amazon Customer Service, spent an hour going in circles with them, and eventually got a refund to my GC balance for the item. The sad thing is that AMAZON is the one that refunded me, not the company messaging me. That basically equates to \"we lied about our refund policy on our page, then lied to you again in a message directly to you.\" If I could give the item -1 stars just to stress the awful experience I've had with both the quality of the item and the customer service I received, I'd lower it even further into the negatives.TLDR: one crucial board was the wrong size, so the desk couldn't be assembled at all. Instructions had typos directing use of wrong pieces, and one hole in the metal bar/brace would've required drilling to make it align correctly.Board \"G\" of the set I received was not the right size; it was an inch short on both sides (see pictures), which skewed all the pre-tapped holes and made it impossible to assemble. Additionally, the instructions included had not one, not two, but FOUR typos in them, two of which instruct you to use an entirely different (incorrect) part of the kit. By typos, I don't mean spelling a word wrong; the instructions tfell you to use the wrong item (telling you to use nut \"O\" instead of the nut \"M\" that's clearly being shown in the picture). I even tried using the incorrect piece to check my sanity, and it wasn't usable in that step at all.I'm not new to assembling furniture and other (much more complicated) items, this is probably the sixth or seventh desk I've put together for my family. One of my hobbies is tinkering and modifying things, and my kids have come to rely on me (way too much) to repair practically every item in our household, from toys to furniture to electronics and PC components. That being said, no amount of modification to this mis-sized board \"G\" would allow me to attach it in a way that would make me comfortable enough to let my son use the desk.Clearly a board from another set was included with mine, and I've seen at least one other review mentioning the same issue. This particular piece, however, is a centerpiece that the shelves, base, and desktop all attach to for support, so there's really no way for me to just skip it or remove it from the assembly without compromising everything else. Maybe if I stick it in the dirt and water it and talk to it, it'll magically grow to the size it was meant to be.Dismissing the issue with being unable to use my new stack of firewood, quality of the item is also sub-par, but roughly falls into the price range its offered for. The boards are your typical cheap pressboard (think compressed paper/cardboard in between slightly thicker sheets of laminate), so be really careful with your screws; power tools could easily go farther than the screws are meant to go, and if you're slightly off with your angle, the board will just splinter/tear and make that hole essentially useless (a normal condition of using pressboard). While fuming over the infamous board in my stack, I tried to assemble other pieces and noted that the metal bars/braces that go under the majority of the desk area also didn't line up correctly, and in order to get a slightly longer bolt inserted through the metal bar and into the bottom of the desk, I would've had to take a drill or file and cut the hole so it would align closely enough to let me force the bolt through. At that point, I entirely gave up and decided this 1-star review was very much merited.Again, you get what you pay for, but I didn't even get that. I got something that's physically impossible to assemble without the kind of modification that would've been the same as if I bought raw materials and built my own desk. I doubt I'll be receiving the correct board despite my following Amazon's directions to the letter, and I can't return the item because the box was ruined both in transit and on me opening it to remove the desk. As it stands (or in this case, doesn't? ha), I'm staring at a stack of cheap pressboard that cost me ten times what it was worth due to its inability to fulfill its proper function.",
