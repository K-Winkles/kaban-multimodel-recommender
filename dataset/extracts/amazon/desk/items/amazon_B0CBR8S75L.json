                "reviewText": "Very sturdy, good materials and came with the correct spacing that I wanted. Although the assembly was a bit tricky because you need to have an eye for detail (some of the holes need to be exactly outwards or else you will have to dissasemble and re attach the correct way).Im glad all the parts needed came in the package, however, for the #7 & #5 pillars, 1 hole was not drilled in and left me installing only 1 bolt for the top pillar support that connects to the desk.Asides from that, intuitive, sleek looking and just what I wanted!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. 2nd update:Every day I love this desk even more. I\u2019m considering getting another one and combining them into an L shaped desk because my other desk doesn\u2019t measure up to this one. I normally don\u2019t review a lot of things and even less give an update or post a video but this desk is worth it.Update:The LED works now! I have no idea what happened. I didn\u2019t do anything to fix the issue but with a couple of days it now works. All the lights turn on. The desk is still awesome and I love it even more now with the working LED lights.Previous Review:I love the desk. It\u2019s exactly as it looks like. They sent everything that would be needed to put it together, tools for the parts even a screwdriver. The only issue is that my LED lights don\u2019t light up completely. Half of the bottom part of the strip just doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t see any damages or cuts on it, it just does not light up. But besides that I love it. I just wish the LED lights had worked because I wanted extra lighting in the nighttime.",
