                "reviewText": "I have assembled for my self and others many laminate wood and frame furniture that uses standard pin &cam/screw hardware. This is probably the best designed and highest quality desk I\u2019ve seen.Assembly was a breeze (about 45 mins by myself) with the clear instructions, fully labeled parts, and included tools. There are no awkward fittings or angles making it hard to fasten parts. All parts are well-finished with clean edges. The pin & cam pieces are good quality, with the pins screwing into plastic threaded sockets rather than engineered wood, so this adds a level of stability and secure fit.With a minimum of care I expect this will stay together and look good as new for many years. You can\u2019t match this for the price.",

I put it together quickly and it even came with extra fasteners instead of missing a few. The 2 top drawers are just on rails so there's friction when opening but the bottom drawer is on sliding rails which is nice.",

The ease of assembly was also surprising, with every part labeled and an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide.The drawer section is not the sturdiest, due to the cam assembly design. I will most likely reinforce them with some type of epoxy or glue to ensure they don't loosen. I also suggest being very gentle when opening and closing them to avoid undue stress on the parts. Afterall, it is only particle board and laminate.The top main desk section was also damaged (see photos) during shipment. The seller offered to replace the piece or refund $50 from the purchase price.I do recommend this product based on its functionality and appearance. Just be aware that it's not a high-end item and the quality and materials are on par with the price.",

                "reviewText": "Well, where do I start. First the material is extremely cheap for the price. Then the way the instructions are set does not go with what you actually have to do, in fact, the numbers where switched and a few pieces causing me to undo all of what I had done up to that point (again on several pcs). Some screw did not go in so the smaller top portion (narrow table) has only 2 out of 4 screws. The whole thing is not that stable either...it sways too much and this after tightening all of the screws but every time I would screw one of them to almost the fullest, you hear the creek and cracks on the fake wood and it's like, oh it's going to break so let me just leave it up to where ever I left it at. The bigger cabinet did not close correctly at all because the screws are all not flushed as they don't go anywhere else. I was very frustrated and 3/4 of the way I was going to give up but I did not want to undo the whole thing which took my wife and I around 2 + hours to build......this coming from a very handyman like myself, usually I'm pretty good at doing these things since I've been doing it since I was 17...I'm now 50, so go figure. Anyway, save yourself the headache and buy something else.",
