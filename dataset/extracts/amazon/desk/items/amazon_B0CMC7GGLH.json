                "reviewText": "Just received this today, assembly was very straightforward and quick. Quality of the materials seems pretty decent especially at the $100 price point that I paid. One minor complaint that I have is that it doesn't go quite low enough for what I would have liked but it's about the same as my previous desk, and that's on me for not doing thorough enough research. Not a deal breaker.The biggest inherent flaw that sticks out to me is the amount of front-to-back wobble that the desk exhibits when in standing position. It's distracting to me while I work which is unfortunate but luckily I don't stand most days for more than a couple hours so hopefully it isn't too much for me to deal with. Not a strong enough reason to deal with returning it at this point, we'll see how well I am able to tolerate it moving forward.Otherwise, some praise:* Motor is quiet and smooth* Memory function is really nice to have so I don't need to micro adjust settings every time I want to stand* As mentioned, assembly with my existing desk top was a breeze.",

The hardest part was figuring out the instructions.I got the white top and it is already scraped and the paint looks weird, I wish I would have gotten the wood top. The white is a thin, wobbly .5 piece of particle board or something. Would send it back but don't want to disassemble.",
