My only complaint is with the drawers, which are made like those collapsible square organizers. Same material and construction, with a faux leather front. They feel pretty flimsy and don't slide in and out very smoothly. I don't feel like they'd hold much weight without taking damage. But it's a pretty minor thing, not even worth taking a star off for. All in all, great desk at a great price!",

It did take a little while putting this thing together. But the end result was worth it. Love the crisp white of it. Makes the area seem brighter and cleaner. Easy to clean this desk as well",

The option to fix this small part 1\"X7\"X1.5\" that is held in place with two small screws, is to disassemble the entire desk and send it back. I spent two hours trying to get just the plug strip replaced. NO LUCK. take the desk apart package the entire thing up and send it back is the only option.",

I can finally live out my dream of being a giant without having to go through the hassle of growing to 50 feet tall. The desk is so small that it\u2019s perfect for people who want to work from home but don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re actually working. The power outlets and USB charging port are a great addition, but I\u2019m still waiting for the day when they invent a desk that can charge my phone while I lay in bed. Overall, I\u2019d say this desk is perfect for anyone who wants to feel like a giant while they work.",
