And it had to accommodate the footrest of my recliner!The packaging is effective and protective, the assembly instructions are clear, the parts are pre-drilled with guide holes... it really couldn't be easier!The base of the table fits around the footrest of my recliner, the top surface is large enough for my giant cat to be comfortable, and best of all, my bead tray, e-reader, tools, and supplies have plenty of room on the \"keyboard tray.\" The cat doesn't lay in the beads, and i can quickly tuck the whole process out of the way when i need to get up.This meets my needs perfectly, and is exactly what I hoped for!",

It's a perfect set up for my laptop and a second screen, the keyboard tray is perfect and allows me so much more desk room. My only complaint is it's too tall for a standard chair if I want my feet on the floor. I'm going to do what another reviewer said and use a pipe cutter to shorten it a couple of inches.",

                "reviewText": "I'd give this rolling desk a 4.5 if I could. It is good quality, and it looks very nice. It's sturdy, the keyboard tray rolls out smoothly, and it was very easy for me to put together by myself. I found it expensive, but I'd buy it again for the quality. Just be aware of two things.The casters are tiny and cheap, so if you're planning to roll it around much (that's what I got it for, so I could roll my workstation outside onto our deck) you are going to be saying bad words. They're designed so that if you don't go in a straight line, they swivel under the crossbar, which pushes the lock down so they lock themselves. $%#@!!The other thing is that it is a sit/stand, but it doesn't go all the way down. If you look at the picture, you'll see that there is a couple of inches of the inner part of the stand that do not retract into the outer part. That means you can't put it all the way down. As a result, it's too tall for me to sit at in a normal chair (I'm 5'1\" so on the short side, but still). So I have to take my equipment off of it and put it on the table on our deck, which kind of defeats the purpose of what I personally got it for. If you have a desk chair you can raise, and long enough legs (or a footstool), it would probably be fine.",

                "reviewText": "We moved into a condo and I work from home - needed something for my laptop and monitor, but didn't want a full-size desk as my workspace would now be in the 'guest' room. This desk is really perfect - I like that I can raise it up (as I stand most of the time), but that it can also be adjusted. You do have to loosen 4 screw knobs to raise/lower it - so it's not super simple (like pressing a button on an electronic standing desk) - but it works. I can wheel this into the closet or move it to another room - very functional and sturdy. Only downside is that there's not a lot of 'workspace' - but again, this is great is you have limited space.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my granddaughter so that I could get my puzzle table back to being for puzzles vs. laptop and whatever else she'd leave on it. She LOVES it as it's just the right size for her to use her laptop or her drawing pad. With the pull out tray, her drawing pad (which connects to her laptop) sits on the pull out tray perfectly and her laptop just remains on the desktop. Love that you are able to adjust the height of the desk so that it can grow with her. I saw a few people say that it was too tall, but not sure how that is as my granddaughter is very small for her age (11 and always inches shorter than her classmates) and we still needed to raise it an inch or two to where it felt best for her. Plus, with it still being able to raise a several inches more, it should be able to easily accommodate her on through her school years.This desk is nicely made, very sturdy and should last as long as we need it. Very good quality for the cost. The only slight negative is the sliding/pull out keyboard was a bit stiff to move at first, but using a bit of WD-40 on it and sliding it back and forth a few times helped make that better. It's still not the best slides I've ever had (for which I paid far more), but, especially since it's her drawing pad that's she uses it for, she's glad it doesn't easily slide in as it could interfere with her intricate drawings if it were to move to easily while she's creating.Bottom line, great small desk and glad that I chose this one!",

                "reviewText": "I got this based on the claims that this could be used at couch and bed height. This is not true. It doesn't sink low enough in the frame to be able to use the keyboard at that height. The keyboard is up around my chest height when I'm sitting down and i\"m 6'.The entire reason I bough this was to use it at lower heights than my regular desk. The pics show it near a couch and a bed, but if you look closely you'll see it's too high. I did notice that but I saw a good distance between the knobs and the platform, leading me to think it can be adjusted lower, but it cannot.This is okay for standing, and for a standard adjustable office chair but not an easy boy, couch, or bed. False advertising.That being said, it's made well enough for the money, and wasn't too ridiculous to put together even though I had to pry open some of the metal drawer fasteners. If it would sink a few inches more into the base so I can use it sitting down it would be perfect. Now I'm not sure I can return it, or even want to, now that it is fully assembled.If you want to use this at couch height and don't have a hack saw to do major surgery stay away from this item.",
