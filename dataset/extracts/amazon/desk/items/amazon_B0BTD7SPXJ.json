However, it gets the job done. It is a sturdy table that was easy enough to set up, and so far I have no complaints.Would highly recommend this table, especially to those needing it for solely computer work/moving into smaller spaces.",

                "reviewText": "WFH warrior here. Needed a larger desk for my workstation. Previously my laptop sat in front of my secondary monitor with a bit of overlap at the bottom. Enough so that I would have to close my lid a little to see the whole screen. When on zoom calls that means the camera points down to my fat belly. I bought this desk hoping that I could get a little breathing room. That answer is more than enough. I have a 27 inch 4k monitor next to my laptop and my ipad next to the laptop and still have room for a coffee and a plant. Sturdy built no wobble at all, wood looks real. Would recommend.",

It is a good value for the money.",

Like you would normally place your arm on against the desk while typing and etc. your not able to do that because the edges all the way around on this desk is uncomfortable and a bit sharp. I had to order rubber off Amazon to place all around the desk so that it's more comfortable. I believe I typed in safety rubber on Amazon and it came right up for me. The rubber protects you against objects or furniture with sharp edges and can be used if someone as \" baby proofing\" if someone had a toddler. If you're going to buy this desk I would recommend also purchasing that safety rubber. I honestly wished I ordered another desk type/ style but I'll keep this one for now",
