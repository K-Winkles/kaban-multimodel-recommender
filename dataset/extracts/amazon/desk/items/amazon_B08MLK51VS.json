                "reviewText": "So it was mostly easy to build... at a certain point I felt like there were a few unnecessary pieces. But it only took me about 30-45 mins to assemble & fit brilliantly into the small space in front of my window which I turned into a computer nook. I needed something that was narrow but deep enough to accommodate a large laptop. From the looks of it, I'm guessing it could just fit all the necessities of a desktop with a 20-inch monitor, keyboard, & mouse. The upper shelf is a great height for speakers, but be careful putting liquids up there as the unit does move slightly with rapid keystrokes, & bumping it will cause mayhem. But it's both inexpensive & great quality. The wood is sealed & a good-quality weight. Overall, I love this piece.",
