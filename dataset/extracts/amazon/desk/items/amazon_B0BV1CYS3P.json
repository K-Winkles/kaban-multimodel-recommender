                "reviewText": "This is an adorable sturdy little desk with two drawers. They are described as cloth but are cloth over some kind of cardboard-ish material that is pretty strong. I wouldn\u2019t pile a lot of heavy things in them but I have no serious concerns that they will hold up decently. I\u2019m very pleased with it. My sister and I put it together. There was one tricky part to have the leg bars facing the correct direction so you can install the crossbar braces, but we just unscrewed the screws and rotated the bars and redid the screws and all was well.",
