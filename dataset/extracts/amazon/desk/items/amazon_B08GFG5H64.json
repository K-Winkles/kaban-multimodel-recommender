We all know how expensive these things are and quality definitely drops with the price.After a lot of researching and hair pulling, I went with this Fezibo. I was pretty excited when it arrived. It was in a much smaller box than I had imagined, but that was no problem.I found it fairly easy to assemble, but ran into one snag. The bar(spit) that spins to raise/lower the table seemed to not fit right. I got in touch with customer service where I explained my situation and sent photos. They were quick to ask pertinent questions, but could not help other than ask for a day to examine and they would send me a new part.Luckily, that's when my wife interceded and pointed out I had tried to incorrectly mount the part. It was my fault. I quickly put it together and all was good. I let customer service know and all were happy.The desk looks great. Works great. Is quite sturdy and fits into my small area nicely. I am quite pleased with this purchase for its quality and price.",

                "reviewText": "I was impressed with how well it was packaged. All hardware was in individual bags, labeled with letters or numbers to correspond to the assembly directions. There was foam around every piece so despite the outside box being a little beat-up, all parts were flawless. For most of the small hardware like screws, there was at least one extra leftover.The assembly was pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It took me about an hour to assemble by myself. After you attach the legs to the table top, you do have to flip it which would be easier with two people but it's not terribly heavy so it's doable by yourself.For the space I have available, the 55\" fits perfectly and has room for both of my laptops and an extra monitor. I will probably look into adding monitor arms to get another monitor to fit. Feels pretty sturdy despite the top being pretty thin. There is a very slight wobble if you bump it when it's at its highest setting but doesn't seem like it would tip over.The control panel has 3 presets and is easy to set them, simple press the \"S\" button while on the desired height and then tap the 1, 2, or 3 button to set that button to that height. The three presets allow you to set a sitting height, standing height and another height that I use for when I'm on the standing board which bumps me up another inch or two. I am about 5'11\" and with the standing board I have to have the desk maxed out so if you're much taller, it might not be high enough for you. The motor is not silent but isn't very loud.For the price, it is well worth it. Looked into some others and they were 3-4x as expensive as this for a similarly sized desk.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble. The desk is sturdy and doesn't shake. Power control works well but you need to reset it befor it will work. Easy enough, hold \"up\" and \"down\" together.I got this not so much as a standing desk, but because I'm tall and want a higher desk surface. This fits the bill perfectly as the control moves the top up and down smoothly and can store 3 positions.The desk top is in two pieces that need to be edge joined with dowls. This gives a seem down the middle of the top which may be annoying to some. It would bother me. Instead I got the seriously ugly rustic brown color at a significant discount, probably because nobody wants it. The top went straight to the trash and I'm using the 24x48 top I used previously with fixed legs. I suggest this route as I have no seem and a surface I like.The only negative other than the seem in the top, is that with the 24x48 size that I got, the legs are not at the left and right edges. They are set in about 6 inches on each side. The reason I assume, is so they can use the same legs with a smaller top. They're not close enough to be annoying so it isn't much of an issue.Overall, I'm very happy.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I've had this desk for almost a year. The desk itself has held up very nicely. BUT, the motor is an issue. Still seems to work fine when going up. Going down however, it always goes down a bit, stops, goes up a bit, then stops. This is true with both the presets and the down button. So you have to press either button repeatedly to get it back to the original position. This happens every single time. Still glad I didn't pay hundred even thousands of dollars for an expensive standing desk lol, but it is somewhat annoying.*********************************I researched standing desk and was almost convinced by various articles, forums, etc. that I needed to spend several hundred dollars for a good standing desk. Then I decided to buy this one for a fraction of the cost to try out for a while to see if I would actually use it before investing that much.I love this desk! It was easy to assemble by myself, it's the perfect size, it has the four memory presents, the motor runs smoothly and it's sturdy. I don't notice any wobbling when I'm using it in a standing mode. I also love how it looks, the rustic brown is so pretty and I don't even notice the split top (something I was worried about). I am super happy with this desk, and don't see the need to spend 2-3x more. Highly recommend!",

I was worried about it wobbling, or not looking like the photos. I needn't have worried. Husband assembled it in an hour or so and it looks great. Best of all, it is easy to use and very sturdy. We didn't do any extra gluing or enhancement. Simply followed the instructions. Its easy to preset the heights, smooth to adjust, and is steady to work at when standing. I love this desk and so glad I purchased. Its as good as the much more expensive desks in my work's office. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend",
