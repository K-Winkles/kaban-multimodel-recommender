The desk was very well packed, with study cardboard protector corners, plenty of styrofoam blocking, and plastic bags over all pieces. The written instructions were clearly written and the installation video here on Amazon was helpful too. It took me about 90 minutes to put it all together by myself using a screwdriver with the same allen wrench type bit the desk came with. The desk is very sturdy and the shelves are large enough to hold a printer and a laptop laying flat. The desktop area has space for a 24-inch wide screen monitor, a laptop on a laptop stand, a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and extra space to move things around for writing notes or a cup of coffee. The area where you sit has plenty of space for a rolling computer chair. This desk is perfect to setup a telework office in a small apartment or bedroom in a pinch. I highly recommend this desk, I think you'll be hard pressed to find another desk with these specs for this price.",

Packaging was very minimal and I can see why some people have had damaged ones delivered.Directions are not the best, but once you know that the smaller (medium) screws are the ones that go into the wood you\u2019ll be fine. A 5/32 hex socket on a 1/4 Ratchet makes assembling it go way faster. Although the tool it comes with does work4/5 based off of directions and quality",

                "reviewText": "To start it was well packed, even had end protectors on the corners of the desktop to protect it during shipping. With one person assembly it took 2 1/2 hours and was not difficult. I suggest having your own Allen wrenches handy because the one that comes with it is cheap and stripped very easily. I am very happy with the purchase I like it has adjustable spin knobs on the bottom so you can adjust it to make it level.I recommend this if you want a simple but very sturdy and good looking desk.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second time we ordered this desk. The first time they made a mistake and sent us a bed frame! So we returned that easily and re-ordered the desk. It does look fine and serves its purpose. My college student really likes it. That being said, it\u2019s pricey for what it is. It\u2019s nice there\u2019s two shelves but would\u2019ve been great if it had a drawer. I do think these are overpriced for a put together desk frame. Price seems about double what it should sell for. I see a ton of these desks for sale on Craigslist in college towns. I would still buy this again. But might check the secondary market first.",

The 47\" desk is great for smaller apartments and has room to fit multiple monitors, a laptop and a printer. If you're like me and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on these large, fancy desks, than this is the one for you!",

For the top 2, it had the proper cut and fitting to add the rails for the drawers but for the lower 2 the frame had not been properly engineered. I thought maybe I had used the wrong piece, but the other similar piece was installed where it should. Of course, it was the final piece to the assembly. No, I didn't call or ask for customer service. . . . after working on it a couple of hours, I just decided to do without the 2 lower drawers . . . not worth the trouble to start over.",
