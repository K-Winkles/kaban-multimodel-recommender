                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Bit of a puzzle, but a solid desk",
                "reviewText": "To start with, it's a good desk, solid value. Seemed pretty well made, I'm not gonna drive nails with the metal components, but nothing was under-engineered for the job of being a \"desk\" (tho i sincerely doubt the elephant depicted sitting on it in one of the pix, could actually be pulled off\ud83e\udd23).Good balance of quality and price. All parts and hardware were there (spare wooden top dowel & pair of wood screws for attaching the power strip, for that matter). Happy camper.Took a couple hours to build, w a power screw driver, using a suitable allen wrench bit, and a rubber mallet (for wacking the feet in, and tapping the top dowels/pieces together).Reviews do a pretty good job setting expectations, as to assembly. \ud83d\ude01 This one's a '1000 piece puzzle', at the least. \ud83d\ude02 Largely due to the *extremely simplified* manual, which combos *multiple* components of \"assembly\" in each *teeny tiny step picture*. Without written descriptions.For technical-oriented folks that *enjoy a challenge*, it's not a big deal. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I set aside enough time & tackled it as a \"puzzle\" to be worked through.\ud83d\ude02 Grabbed a beer break mid way. But I could see where a lot of folks, that just want a desk assembled *quickly*, could get frustrated. \ud83d\ude09All parts are letter coded w stickers, and the hardware is numbered - well the *extremely fragile* zip locks holding them are, numbered. But in my case most of the (3) mid length bolts were distributed all over the box, due to bag \"fail\". \ud83d\ude06It's hepful to have one of those magnetic screw bowls handy, when picking out loose parts, keeps things in one place.Also, mine was shipped usps by amazon, and the box took some beating en route. No damage to the parts but it's somewhat a crapshoot. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fPay *extreme* attention to those screw holes and orientation on the parts (bring ur readers \ud83d\udc53 if you need em. Hell bring 'em anyway!\ud83d\ude02) Heh even if when I did - pay close attn - I still had to unbuild components and swap orientations of parts, a couple of times. Including a complete rebuild of the shelf unit, when the front apron mount screw holes wound up on the wrooong side.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Goes quickly with a power driver. \ud83d\ude06Tips:- Do the dowels/top *before* you lay the desk over the top pieces for screwing - that was the *3rd* bit i had to disassmble and rotate: i missed the 'B' top, dowel hole orientation in the teeny tiny pix.\ud83d\ude06 Simpler done *before* you've got most of the screws in.- And as the instructions recommend, dont tighten down bolts until you're substantially done w assembly. I waited until bolting down the desktop, after pushing the components into alignment (with a board as an alignment straight edge), to do final tightening.- On the bolts, if you use a power driver, *don't over tighten*, the driver can quickly indent the bolt into the 'tubes'. \ud83d\ude43- Oh and on all those top 'tubes' orient the oval holes 'up', its not clear from the pix, but they are the bolt holes for the desktop.On net i'm extrely happy with the buy (and caught a lightening deal for $30 off). It perfectly fits the space of the 18yo ikea wooden corner armoire I wanted to replace, for full time WFH.Its a *compact* desktop but I've now got a pair of widescreen 24\" monitors and a larger 27\", and three laptops in use, one with a docking station (and usb & hdmi switchers). It's as big as I can fit in the space and just big enuf for my needs.Coming from a corner armoire, one solid add I made was to pick up the Vivo corner adapter https://a.co/d/7R3h7qI. I'm using it to span the corner under my keyboard for actual use of the *corner* of the desk to work from. The desk isn't *technically* designed to use it this way - there's a shelf below the side return of the desk etc - but there's enough leg room even with the shelf to use it as a real corner desk. Proviso: the support rail on the front edge of the desktop will probably obstruct screwing the VIVO in. But I'm using it un-bolted as a surface for the keyboard. No keyboard tray/arm use. Also leaves me able to shift the vivo around to orient to the monitor I'm working with.The power strip is handy, though I'm using a better belkin power arrester strip for *all* computer hdwe: a past lightening strike'll make you a *believer*. \ud83d\ude09Only area I'd would like an upgrade on would be the square edge on the top: sort of cuts into your forearm operating a mouse (I'll probably repurpose an old floppy mouse pad as a corner cushion there).On net: I like it! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d Solid choice.Oh, and, on the instructions front, the manufacturer sent me 2 emails referring upgraded instructions (which I didn't get a chance to use - assembled it before spotting the emails \ud83d\ude02). They *know* the instructions are an issue, and are trying to get in front of the problem. And the upgraded instructions may be a solid improvement over the single page in the box. Heck, using s zoomable pdf would probably be a big up.\ud83d\ude01Nother later add: picked up the Vivo pencil drawer - has enuf clearance to clear the desktop frame, useful storage.",

                "reviewText": "I rated it three stars because of the shelves. You will have to put your printer on the top as none of the shelves on the side piece are wide enough. They are not even wide enough to hold Amazon's stacking in/out trays, the bottom shelf is too close to the shelf above so I can't put my small (13\" tall) computer there. I had to stick my laser printer sideways on the shelf, my inkjet has to sit on top due to its size. The instructions are a bit confusing, especially where the legs are concerned. If you have a lapse of consciousness and do buy one, check all the positions before screwing anything. The legs for the extension are real easy to reverse. The desk itself is fairly sturdy, I have a 32\" monitor and there is no problem holding it. I haven't figured out what to use the shelf under the main part for yet, my computer might just fit, sideways, but then it's in a very awkward position to get to. Size-wise, however, it's just perfect for fitting into the corner of my bedroom, and there is enough room under the extension for my dog to have her bed without me encroaching on her space. All-in-all, it's an OK unit that could have used a bit more thought in its design which would have made it an excellent choice rather than just OK.",
