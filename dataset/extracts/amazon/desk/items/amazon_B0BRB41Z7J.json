                "reviewText": "This desk took my husband maybe a few hours to leisurely put together, and looks so nice! I love the higher shelf to put monitors on, works perfect for my 2 monitors and laptop to the side. Had it a few weeks, seems sturdy. Only downside is the drawers are fabric which we don\u2019t like because our cats scratch it, but it is very clearly labeled as fabric drawers in the pictures and I just didn\u2019t pay attention! The drawers are still nice and hold a lot, just a little flimsy if you have 3 intense cats. 5 stars because shouldn\u2019t dock them for me not reading :) great for the price!",

It seems very sturdy and I haven't had to tighten anything since assembly. I can't speak to the quality of the sticky tape for the light strip, because I used my own.

It\u2019s pretty decent size so be sure to measure the area you\u2019re going to put it.It takes some time to assemble but it\u2019s not rocket science. Also worth noting that while the front of the drawers are wood (or maybe a synthetic), the body of the drawers is a synthetic fabric/plastic material. They\u2019re still very sturdy and practical, just not what I was expecting. All around great desk through.",

I was fully able to understand the instructions with no issues. After rearranging my room many times throughout having this desk, I found that the bulky drawer side was really sticking out like a sore thumb. So I write the the company about the reversible instructions and they pointed me to the instructions manual on the buying page here on Amazon. I took the desk apart and went step by step to reverse it. However during this process, which where it goes wrong begins with the bars not having holes to reverse it on the drawers side. The manual has the steps however the bars do not have the holes drilled out. So do not waste your time trying to reverse it. It will only cause you a lot of frustration, wasted time and madness. I had to put it all back together and during this process the table top split at the bolt hole. Also, my desk did not come with any RGB lighting, which I was told by the manufacturer that I bought the old version but they could send me lights or refund my money entirely. Which I never got the refund.",
