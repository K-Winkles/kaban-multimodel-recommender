It was great but I live in a small space and the \"L\" part was just constantly getting in the way. I got this in the 63\" version because I liked the length of my old desk and it's just perfect for what I need!Took me about 30/40 minutes to put together by myself. Instructions were great and it came with all hardware and tools needed, plus some extra. The box wasn't too heavy at all, about 40lbs or so. It is an awkward box to get up/down stairs but it's doable.For the price, this is a 10/10!",

                "reviewText": "Product was super easy to assemble took me about 40 minutes. The main reason I bought this desk is not only cause of the good price but the USB station that is on top of the desk. The station has 3 normal wall outlet plugs USB A and USB C ports. On my first Plug statiom from the box had faulty wall outlet plugs and the USB A and TYPE C did not work at all. I contacted the seller of this and got a brand new plug station in about 3-5 days after contacting them for no charge which is awesome. However, after numerous testing with different USB A and C plugs the USB A and C ports are both dead on arrival again. I don\u2019t know what is causing this but it is very unfortunate that this plug station only half works. I used multiple Apple Certified and other third party type A and C cables and none of them charged anything no response. I don\u2019t know what I am missing here to fix this problem but this is the reason why I am giving this a 3/5. I would suggest getting this desk as the desk so far is amazing but don\u2019t be surprised if your charging plug station has a few plugs and ports that don\u2019t work at all.",
