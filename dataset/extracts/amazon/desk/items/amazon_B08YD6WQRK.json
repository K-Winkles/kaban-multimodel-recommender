I am left handed and prefer to work on a flat surface.The metal frame is sturdy and does not interfere with the leg room under the desk. I was able to assemble it by myself. Everything I needed was included.Several features really stood out for me and earned the 5 star rating I gave:The box corners were reinforced for shipment and there were styrofoam spacer on all pieces so that they did not shift in shipmet.The wood desk top was shipped with hard plastic corner guards so that the corners were not damaged in shipment.The screw holes to attach the frame to the underside of the desktop have metal inserts in them so that the screws could be tightened without damaging the wood.ALL pre-drilled holes were aligned. The desk went together smoothly and easily.It was square and level upon assembly. I did not have to bend or shim anything.This is one of the best furniture purchases I have made on Amazon. I am completely satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "These were simple to put together. They seem fairly sturdy. I opted to not use the leg screwing things.. whatever you call them as the table is more sturdy without them, plus who can get all 4 uniform. Having them does add about an extra inch or so if needed. The major negative would be the holes the screws go into, some are too deep and the screws are too long so it pushed through the very dry loose brittle Pressboard. Even though the veneer surface is pretty I guess being careful how deep to screw the screws and making sure you have the right size screw would be in order. Otherwise I like how they look and they are sturdy enough for my needs. Btw. Don't bother messaging seller about the holes the screws may, I'm pretty sure they know how cheap this Pressboard product is. After all it took 2 weeks to come from China. I wonder if paying more for one from an Amazon seller would be any better, probably not, after all it all comes from China. Politically I wonder what that means as we can't buy something like this from U S A. Oh, right, it would cost more. Life has it's tradeoffs. Meanwhile, it does the job and the Natural Wood look is nice, it is light and pretty. Would I buy again from this source? I would probably choose a more expensive source and HOPE the quality is a little better.",
