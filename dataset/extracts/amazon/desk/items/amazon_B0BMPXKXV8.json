                "reviewText": "This is a very nice desk for the price! Great color and structure, seems very solid and doesn't take up much space. Was fairly simple to put together and I love the option of the cabinet going on either side. The drawers have a nice depth to them but the top is just a little less spacious than I thought but it works. My only minor complaint would be the drawers. They are not on a track, the drawers themselves slide on the metal frame, and because of this they are sometimes a little difficult to open and close smoothly and sometimes stick and drag. But overall I would definitely recommend!",

Like all furniture assembly, look at the instructions carefully and lay the parts out so you can access them easily. The quality is very good and I love the appearance. A great price and it fits my Canon printer perfectly.",

The Allen key supplied was a tad small. I really recommend this desk.",
