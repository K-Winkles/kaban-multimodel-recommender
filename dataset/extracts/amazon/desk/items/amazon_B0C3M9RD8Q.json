                "reviewText": "Five Stars - Excellent Wooden L-Shaped Desk!I recently purchased the Wooden L-Shaped Desk, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! This desk has exceeded all my expectations and more. From the moment it arrived, I could tell that it was a high-quality piece of furniture.First and foremost, the design is stunning. The L-shape provides ample space for my computer setup, paperwork, and other essentials, while still leaving plenty of room for me to work comfortably. The desk's smooth wooden surface gives it a touch of elegance that complements any office or home decor.The build quality is exceptional. The sturdy construction ensures that this desk will last for years to come. I never have to worry about it wobbling or feeling unstable, even with multiple monitors and heavy equipment on top. The solid wood material feels durable and reliable, making it a worthwhile investment.One of the things I appreciate the most about this desk is the organization it offers. With built-in drawers and shelves, I can keep my workspace neat and tidy. No more cluttered desks and searching for lost items!

It took me only a short amount of time to put it all together without any hassle.

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for the wife. I got them mostly for the height, as I just recently bought 2 chairs that were taller than our previous desks and wouldn't fit underneath. Instead of ruining the leather armrests on a pair of $400 chairs, taller desks were in order.As I said in the title, you don't put this together, you build it. Unlike other cheap quality put-together cam-and-stud pieces of furniture that I usually find on Amazon, this desk has actual screws and bolts you build it with. I'll be looking for more of this type of furniture from this vendor in the future.The metal is sturdy aluminum, and the wood is 1/2\" plywood covered with a high-quality laminate. The box is a little on the heavy side, so unless you're fairly strong, I recommend having a second pair of hands to help you carry it. The box was packed well, using lots of Styrofoam and plastic corner protectors for the wood tops. Nothing was damaged or scratched in either box. Although it's not heavy to push around when complete, the desk is a little on the large size, so I recommend building it in the place where you're going to be using it to make it easier.The diagrams in the book are easy to read, and everything is clearly labeled. From start to finish using a ratchet screwdriver with exchangeable bits (the package comes with a screwdriver, allen tool, and small wrench). Each desk took me about an hour to build by myself. It is versatile and can be assembled as a long desk, or an L-shape left or right. I put a mirror image of my wife's desk (on the left) to show you what our office area looks like with both desks in place.I have a curved widescreen monitor with a large stand. Because of the size of the stand (which is designed to fit in a corner), it takes up half of the 20\" depth of the top. As I rent, I'm not allowed to mount things to the walls so I ordered a monitor arm to get it closer to the wall. So keep this in mind for all you widescreen users out there.I have a full-size computer tower sitting on top as it won't fit underneath. The computer shelf has enough space to accommodate a PC that is 9 3/4\" wide, 18 3/4\" tall, and 17 1/2\" deep. Technically, you can go deeper, but you'll need to pull the desk away from the wall or have the front of the PC sticking out a little for anything longer. My external Blu-Ray drive sits on the little shelf above the PC shelf. I could easily stack 2 of them in this little space, and since my PC tower sits above it, running cables wasn't a problem.I like the cubby shelf. I even put a mini-shelf on top that I had on my desk before to keep all my figurines, snacks, and misc stuff. The cubbies are a decent size, 14\" wide, 6 1/2\" tall, and 7 3/4\" inches deep. Then you have all the space on top to utilize. This feature is very appreciated. I opted to not add the pull-out keyboard shelf, as I prefer to have my keyboard on top of the desk.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this desk. It was very well-designed, and easy to put together. I'll give an update to let you know how it works out having a monitor arm attached.Update: I installed the monitor arm and it's been holding up very well. The monitor arm I picked up allows me to mash the screen as close to the wall as possible. As you can see from the pictures, the back of the monitor sits about 4\" away from the wall. I went from having 10\" of desk space to 16\" of desk space (I had to move the desk 2\" away from the wall to get it to sit flat).The monitor arm I'm using is the ErGear Ultrawide Monitor Arm. It holds up to 26 lbs. (monitor is only 12 lbs with the stand removed), so it's plenty strong for my monitor. It secures well, holds the monitor in place, and the desk is holding it up without issues. You can get it here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B098JT9SFR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Just for giggles, I thought I would show the little shelf I put on the top shelf of the desk. If you have enough ceiling height, you could stack quite a few things up there. I'm 6' tall, and the shelf tops out a couple inches taller than me. Anything taller would be too much for me. You can get that little shelf-shelf here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BRVSQKX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Enjoy your new desk everyone!",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely loving this desk. Assembly was fairly easy and the included instructions are mostly clear and well translated. Once it's all together it gives plenty of desktop space for working. It initially feels a little flimsy, but once you start putting it together and tightening stuff up it becomes very sturdy. As long as you aren't trying to stand on it or something it would last a good long while. The pegboard was something I thought was going to be an afterthought, but upon actual use it's cemented itself as a feature I want on any future desk. The included hooks are OK, but much smaller than implied by the product renders, only good for hanging cables or other lightweight thin items. However, any normal pegboard hardware is compatible and a quick trip to the hardware store can provide you hooks or baskets to hang just about anything you need on it.The computer tower area ended up being too small for my case (full size), but a mini or even a mid should be just fine. Similarly, the keyboard tray is a little small, and fullsize keyboard and mouse will not fit, but TKLs and 60%s will be fine. I could fit the keyboard just itself fine, but I prefer to have my mouse and keyboard at the same level, so I ended up repurposing the tray for a drawing tablet.The included LEDs should really probably be considered a bonus. They're a decent low end set with a basic set of preprogrammed colors. The optional app gives you a few more options. The adhesive on the strip is mostly fine, the plug in has had some sticking problems.Very happy with this desk, it's a great addition to my home office.",
