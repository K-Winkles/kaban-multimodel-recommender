                "reviewText": "I was really needing a new desk but I didn\u2019t want to waste a bunch of money getting some fancy one because I go off to college in about a year so I just needed one that would last me until then. This desk is surprisingly very roomy and I love the cubby\u2019s. It\u2019s perfect for storing books and other items.When I received the package the box was pretty banged up but I\u2019m pretty sure that was from the whole shipping process and not the seller. I opened it up and I noticed that there were a few dirty spots on the desk. It looked almost like mud and it wiped off pretty easily.Assembling the desk took about 45 minutes to an hour. One thing that I will tell you is to really pay attention to the directions and what side and piece you are working on.Out of all the screws that were included there was one that was completely flat on the end where u would put the screwdriver. Luckily there was an extra that was not flat.The drawer was a little difficult to figure out but I got it. However it doesn\u2019t come out all the way. Other than that it is great storage for my markers and pens!",

                "reviewText": "Every since my first year in college I wanted a desk that has a keyboard tray although not exactly how mine was in college. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment but work from home so I needed something small enough but also able to fit a couple monitors. This is perfect, small enough I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s taking up the whole room but big enough I can have two monitors and my laptop plus a wireless keyboard. Like other reviews said the drawer is pretty impossible to get straight, finally gave up after several tries. The rest however is pretty easy to build, although I am the person who enjoys building ikea furniture. Simply because of the chair I have I ended up getting 2 inch furniture risers because it was a tad short but I also have zero concept of size when ordering online so if that matters to you, look at the dimensions.",

The packaging is cheaply made, with no regard or warning to allergies or the dangers of breathing in fiberglass.The styrofoam packaging had this stringy, glass-like substance sticking to the desk and all over the box. Fiberglass is very dangerous to inhale, causes breathing and respiratory irritation, and melts into your skin, causing itchiness, rash, and allergic reactions.I am appalled by the blatant disregard for safety and how there was no warning about the packaging containing this material.Just spend a hundred more dollars and buy a better quality desk.
