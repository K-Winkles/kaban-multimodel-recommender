It's obviously brown, and no I didnt get the one labeled brown on accident. Still a five star review as everything else is exactly like it said it'd be, and it even arrived earlier than expected. I did not have the issue with screws going through the top like some other people. If you use the right screws in the right spots, like the instructions tell you to, you wont have any issues. The instructions are insanely easy to follow. The size is smaller than I wanted, but I didn't look fully at the depth dimension, but 100% my fault. It's at a comfortable height for my chair (standard computer chair). Not for long term use I would think, but enough to get me though college I'm sure.",

My only complaint is the drawers are felt and not wooden, they feel very flimsy and are smaller in person than they look in pictures. I thought they\u2019d be wooden but I should have read the description, the hooks on the side are a nice addition. Overall for the price its a great desk. Set up in under an hour.",

It makes you think you are getting regular wooden drawers. Well, only the front of the drawer is wooden. The actual drawer is fabric. Not happy about that.It\u2019s made with cheap fake wood but it will do for now.Not that sturdy but as I said it will do for now.",
