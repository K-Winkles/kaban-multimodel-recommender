                "reviewText": "Pros: Great value for the price. Package was not too heavy or large, I was able to carry it up a flight of stairs by myself, and assemble the desk on my own in about an hour. It's very sturdy and the manual crank works perfectly and doesn't take too long to go up and down. The included hooks on the sides are super convenient! I like that it is also light weight so it's easy to move. Great, affordable manual desk.Cons: It does require a drill and that was the trickiest part of assembly if you aren't good with drills; it can't really be done with a screwdriver. I wish that the crank handle was white to match the white frame, and that the tabletop was all one piece instead of two. It would also be nice if the metal legs attached closer to the full width of the desk instead of inset by a few inches, so that there would be more leg room overall, potentially allowing you to put a storage cabinet underneath it on the inside of the legs, or just enjoy more width for your legs.",

You can use a drill to make the last part easier but I don't think you NEED it. We did some with the drill and some with the screw driver since the drill was to big for some parts. hope this helps!",
