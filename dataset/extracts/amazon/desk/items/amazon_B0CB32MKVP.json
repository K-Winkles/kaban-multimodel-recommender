The goal was to have a small work desk and vanity duo.It was very easy to assemble. The instructions were clear and understandable, not an excessive amount of pieces, and it was very sturdy once completed. I could carry it up a flight of stairs without falling apart, and the fabric drawers are great! I was a little apprehensive at first.. but they are sturdy, roomy, and make the desk more lightweight- which is very important when having to move it around.The hooks that attach to the metal mesh on the sides of the desk are also very helpful, I can hang stuff like headphones and cords on them, it gives it a more organized look.",

Very easy to assemble, the only thing I was not thrilled is that the drawers are NOT solid, they're cloth/fabric material, almos like the foldable storage cubes you can buy at dollar tree but sturdier. Other than that, the desk is nice and compact.",

It\u2019s very sturdy & the fabric drawers are so spacious, it even fits my 15 inch laptop. The drawers being cloth also keeps the table lightweight & easily moveable. Be careful though, the corners are extremely sharp & dangerous so make sure you put the safety covers on. Overall so happy with this purchase & such a good deal for only $60 bucks!",
