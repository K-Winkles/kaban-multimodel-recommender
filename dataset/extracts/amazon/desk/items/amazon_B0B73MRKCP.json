Wasn't too hard to follow the directions. I had a little trouble lining up the table top with the frame, and I realized I had some things backwards. So double triple check your bars because they all look similar but are not.There was no shortage of extra pieces like screws and bolts which was very much appreciated.I purchased the 66in desk. It fit nicely in the corner of my office and the color is fresh. Unfortunately the only complain I have is the space below the desk where your computer tower would sit is a tad small. So my machine sits on my desk and I have utilized that shelf as a place of storage for important documents.I was also able to slide a separate file cabinet underneath the desk to help pull it all together. Overall I am pleased and it would definitely be something I'd buy again if I needed to.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace an oldschool desk with a pull-out drawer, and the difference was night and day.You get a ton of space with this desk, and you can surround yourself with monitors and gadgets and still have space leftover for a plate of food and a drink!The little side-piece for holding your computer is just a hair too small for a full-size tower case, but you can work around that by getting bigger feet for the computer or using a slightly larger board there.My only complaint is that you have to be extremely careful during some of the middle steps of construction -- there are a few long supports that can hang down, and I actually had one of the screw sockets pop off while I was building it -- the one I had trouble with was rusted and was probably doomed for failure, but I got a replacement unit and had no issues afterwards!All in all, this is a fantastic value for anyone looking to get a snazzy new desk with a ton of space without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "I've put together a lot of cheap furniture from amazon, and the assembly can be a nightmare. Especially coming from china where they don't always do the best translations on budget products. This desk was incredibly quick and easy to put together, the instructions were very concise, and there was also an included QR code to scan for users to watch a video of the desk being assembled for extra visual aide. Other users complained about cosmetic damage from shipping, so it can probably be a bit of a gamble but at this price point I felt comfortable rolling those dice and I'm pleased to say it arrived without a scratch on any of the boards. Despite only weight 45 pounds when assembled, the desk is extremely sturdy, it does not wobble, shake, creak or bend with a full desktop setup and array of items strewn across the top. Here's my one complaint: I have my extremely large and heavy PC tower on the little shelf underneath the desk and it supports it just fine, although I did find that one of the legs (labeled the U piece in shipping and in the instructions) is far shorter than the other three legs and did not reach the floor without a support I added. Had I not been able to find an adequate solution to this, the weight of the PC tower may have broken shelf without four points of contact, who knows. It was an odd oversight to be sure.",

                "reviewText": "So for the price I got it for, I really have no complaints since it is sturdy, easy to assemble, and has plenty of space. The PC shelf is a bit too shallow for my desktop, leaving about 3/4 inch hanging off. Assembly-wise, it took about an hour to build, including me needing to spin parts around after almost finishing, so it was pretty quick. There was also no damage whatsoever, which is something I was see many others encountered.Now, the images shown in the listing are wayyyy different, showing a matte black desk that is at least twice the thickness of the one I got. It\u2019s a solid 3.5 desk on its own, but since I can\u2019t do half a star and the images are obviously misleading, it gets a 3.",
