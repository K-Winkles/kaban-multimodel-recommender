                "reviewText": "I've waited a couple of months to review this desk and let me tell you, it's been worth every penny.MATERIALS:The materials are solid \u2014 there's no doubt about that. The shipping weight is 70 lbs., so you know the stuff in it is sturdy.ASSEMBLY:I assembled it by myself without power tools and it took me two and a half hours, mostly due to being extra careful not to scratch the hardwood with any of the pieces.This desk comes together pretty well. I recommend checking your work after every step as once you assemble the legs with the rest of the body, it becomes hard to make those adjustments without unassembling and tightening.FUNCTIONALITY:I use the height adjuster at least a couple of times every day and it runs smoothly every time. Very little noise and it takes 4 seconds to go from 27.5 \"to 39.6\"My advice if you've never used an adjustable desk \u2014 take your time figuring out a standing height that works for you. It might take a few days until you find one that feels seamless.AESTHETIC:I'm pleased with the Rustic Brown finish. It goes well with the floor I had installed in this room just weeks before getting the desk. The wood finish is smooth to the touch and I've spotted no imperfections. The storage is just a bonus \u2014 it's not ample, but that's why I liked it. It has just enough space to keep some small stuff on the side drawers and under the top slab. Super happy with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice Desk!",
                "reviewText": "I inherited an office with a big, bulky desk. I used it for several years but it finally broke in a few places and needed to be replaced. I wanted something that would allow me to stand and was not so bulky.My sister purchased a similar version of this desk and liked it, so I decided to try it for myself. I opted for the longest version available with the LED lights.ASSEMBLY: If you've put together furniture from popular stores, then you'll be fine. All the tools needed are supplied, but if you have power tools it may go a little faster. I was doing this job in my office, so I opted to use the included tools and they worked fine. The instructions are good to list the part numbers for hardware that correspond with the bags, and all the parts are either labeled or so obvious it doesn't matter. There was at least one extra of each piece of hardware, which was nice. I put it together by myself and didn't have a problem, but if you're small you may want an additional hand. You do have to flip it right side up during assembly and that could by tricky by yourself.QUALITY: The finish is nice and nothing was damaged, but it's your typical laminated MDF board. It would probably scratch easy during assembly if you were careless. I think it will hold up to normal use just fine. The control module for raising/lowering the desk is nice with a crisp LED display. The metal looks ince and all the welds are clean.CONS: This really is a nice desk, but if I were going to be picky and I was looking to buy this desk, I'd want to know a few things:LED STRIP: If you opt for a version with the LED strip, know that the adhesive on the back is basically useless. You'll want to have some kind of additional adhesive tape to help it stick on. It's not obvious from the pictures if it's LED tape or some kind of recessed integrated piece, so I wasn't sure what to expect. As far as powering the LED's, they have a male USB-A end and you have to supply the power brick to power them. There is a push button toggle on the cable to turn them off. I do like that they're a warmish neutral white vs. a cool white. I'd say it's around 4000K - not nearly as warm as the pictures make it out to be. The provided strip is also encased in a white, flexible housing to diffuse the light a little to help with hotspots on the LED strip. This helps, but you can still see where each individual LED chip is when you look at the desk. It's not a seamless beam of light like the pictures show, but also not a dealbreaker.CONTROL MODULE PLACEMENT: The control module for raising/lowering the desk must mount on the right side of the desk. A small cable with a wiring harness that originates at the motor plugs into the back of the module, and then the module plugs into the wall. If the manufacturer would extend the cable from the motor to the module, then (with the proper cable management) the control module could be placed on either side. In my situation, I'd prefer to have it on the left. Again, not a huge deal, but something to note.DESK DEPTH: The depth of the desk in relation to the monitor piece is just fine and has plenty of room. However, My monitor stand is really too wide for the stand. If this desk were 30\" deep and the elevated part made up for the additional 4\", this would fit my monitor perfectly and give a little more storage in the sides. Again, not a dealbreaker or worthy of a return, but that would be helpful.FINAL THOUGHTS: If you're looking at this type of desk I don't think you'll be disappointed! It appears to be worth the price and I expect it to hold up.",

I am 5\u20197\u201d and use a walking pad under the desk that gives me about another 4\u201d of height, and it still has more room to go. The desk matches my existing black Ikea desk very well so it blends right in. I put my laptop dock in the middle section between the two storage containers so it is hidden and feed the cords through the opening in there. I love the storage also as it holds my notepads, pens, glasses, etc. and keeps the desk looking clean.",

Estaba muy emocionada por este escritorio, pues mi trabajo requiere que est\u00e9 sentada mucho rato y pens\u00e9 que tener un escritorio elevado ser\u00eda la soluci\u00f3n. En efecto, el primer mes fue muy \u00fatil, pues pod\u00eda elevarlo y ajustarlo seg\u00fan mis necesidades, adem\u00e1s de que est\u00e1 muy bonito el dise\u00f1o.Por desgracia, hace una semana empez\u00f3 a darme problemas. La pata izquierda se atora y deja de subir, mientras que la derecha (donde est\u00e1 el motor) sube sin problemas. Esto hace que detenga la elevaci\u00f3n (porque no se detiene sola) y me deja con un escritorio chueco. Hay que bajarla lo m\u00e1s que se pueda y tratar de alinearlo, pero el da\u00f1o ya est\u00e1 hecho. Ya no sube de manera uniforme y se atora. No considero que lo que tengo encima pese mucho, porque seg\u00fan las especificaciones aguanta el peso de una persona, y lo que tengo no pesa m\u00e1s de 10 kg (aunque el caj\u00f3n de la PC se vea muy grande, realmente tiene poco dentro).Una l\u00e1stima porque eleg\u00ed este escritorio por sus buenas rese\u00f1as y porque la fabricaci\u00f3n es mucho mejor que otras opciones m\u00e1s baratas, y pens\u00e9 que esto me durar\u00eda muchos a\u00f1os. Pero solo aguant\u00f3 apenas 6 semanas desde que lo instal\u00e9.Pedir\u00e9 la devoluci\u00f3n o bien un cambio... por un escritorio que tenga motores en ambas patas.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very impressed with this desk. I was really nervous buying a desk online as my monitor is heavy and I hate wobbly things. When I opened the box, each piece felt heavy, with smooth edges and a beautiful finish. All the different hardware accessories were in well identified packages (with extras of each). The instructions were minimalistic, but clear. It took me about 1.5 hours to put it together by myself, while listening to a podcast. All the pre-drilled holes were in the right place, all the pieces aligned perfectly, and all the screws went in smoothly and solidly. Most of the tools were included, the only additional tool needed was a standard phillips screwdriver.The desk is quite sturdy. Even with the wheels on and at the highest setting it doesn't wobble when I type. The motor is very quiet, and super smooth. When going from one preset to another, it moves quickly but it slows down just before stopping so it's perfectly smooth, even with a heavy monitor on it.If you're using the wheels, you may find that the minimum height is a bit high. With wheels it's 30.5\" and without it's 28.5\". I'm 5'9\" and it's just ok for me with the wheels. I'm using the wheels because I have a walking threadmill to the side, so I can move the desk from facing my chair to facing my threadmill easily. I love it! But if you're shorter you may need a foot rest or something.I'm really happy I chose the 40\" wide with the two drawers, that gives me plenty of work space without taking up too much space in the room, and it's easy to move. And the double deck allows me to have all my stuff neatly put away, but at my fingertips. I'm super happy with my purchase. In fact, I regret not buying it sooner!",
