Im glad that I went with this desk because it was exactly what I was looking for. Its the perfect size and great quality. My boyfriend was able to put it together in about 20 minutes. Great buy! Desk is easy to build and really nice This desk was so easy to build, it\u2019s recommended for two people but this chick built it in less than an hour. I did get confused simply because this was the first thing I\u2019ve built myself but I laughed at my self and said let\u2019s get a new perspective and turned it the other way and everything came together. You don\u2019t need any other tools everything you need is in the packet included! I think a guy who is good with stuff like this could build it in 15 minutes lol it\u2019s so easy! I\u2019m so happy with myself if you can\u2019t tell hahaha it fits perfectly in the spot I needed to fit it in too but I measured the area and literally bought this because it fit those dimensions. If you\u2019re hesitant just get it because honestly you\u2019re not going to find a better deal. I looked at thrift stores for a few weeks and yeah I had to put it together but it\u2019s not heavy to move and such an easy build. It\u2019s worth the money and I got it on sale too. Perfect sturdy desk for small spaces Easy to assemble. Nice and sturdy desk that exceeded my expectations. Perfecto No pens\u00e9 q fuera taaan peque\u00f1o. Pero lo dec\u00eda en la descripci\u00f3n. Muy lindo 10/10",

I was actually extremely hesitant to purchase this desk because I figured it would be \"just ok\". I was so wrong! It came nicely packaged. The box was beat up, but because the item was packaged so well...there was not a single blemish. It was super easy to put together. It's sturdy. And it is cute. It's the perfect size for what I needed (read the dimensions before buying...it is a smaller desk). Love it! Thank you for such a great quality product!",

                "reviewText": "What I loved was the fact it is compact/small. It\u2019s great in my master bedroom where my husband and I purchased a new laptop. I purchased the white tabletop with a black legs. It\u2019s very sturdy, Took only 20 minutes or less for my husband to put together. The price was great and I was surprised how nice the quality of the table is when we paid such a great price for it. I\u2019m able to use this desk for my new laptop as well as my DVD/CD player and everything that we needed with room to spare. I love the black holder on the side of the table because it holds a lot inside it. You can store many things in it. It\u2019s very roomy and keeps everything organized. Also I loved that it came with a holder for my headphones. It\u2019s great that I am able to use my laptop with this nice table in a quiet area. So I can write my book. There is not one thing I can say that is negative about this table. I purchased a black ergonomic chair that slides in and as I said earlier the table is perfect size. My husband and I both love it so much we are going to purchase another one for our spare bedroom to use as an office for our second computer. It's a great buy and very sturdy.",
