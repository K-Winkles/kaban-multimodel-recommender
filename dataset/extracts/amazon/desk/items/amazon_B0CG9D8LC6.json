                "reviewText": "Update: The seller has good customer service and is responsive. After seeing this review they contacted me to make things right.I'd pay ~$50 to $75 for this desk, but not the $139 that I did. I followed the instructions including small details, double and triple-checking the alignments. The metal bends and warps easily; I alignined all of the pieces with a level, finger-threaded the screws to get everything in place, and then tightened everything. Despite this, the metal pieces twistes and are uneven. When installing the top, I found that the pre-threaded holes in the particle board were roughly 1-3cm off per each hole, causing further tension on the metal and restricting me from tightening the screws for fear of cracking the wood.Maybe I got a manufacturer defect. It's still going to do its job as a desk, but a little overpriced for the quality.",

                "reviewText": "We needed to downsize a desk space and this was pretty much perfect for the job. Assembly went mostly smoothly. The one thing I got wrong--which the instructions were not clear on at all--was easily noticeable and quickly fixed. The instructions are a weensy-bit deceptive in that they are extremely specific, except when they aren't.Anywho, The only real drawback is that the USB-C/Lightning port built into the desk doesn't carry enough current to charge a laptop. I sort of expected that, and it was confirmed. The desk doesn't turn into a wolf at night either, but I'm not lamenting that absent feature, either.It's light-ish-weight, is sturdy for its size, and makes better use of the space than the 40-something-year-old particle board monstrosity that it replaced. We are happy campers.",
