It goes up and down well, but it has a major flaw in the design. The control is located on the left side, however, my outlet is on the right side. The power adapter is not long enough to extend it . If I ran the wire along the top of metal bar, the adapter would be hanging around the leg of the table when I rose the desk at the standing level.Also, it came with a dent and scratch on the desktop, i contacted CS and they promised to send me a new top. I would update the review again when I received a new desk top.",

The product was delivered right on time as promised during order placement.The assembly took a long time as some of the holes did not line up properly with the screws and had ends that was little bit sticking out as well. So had to do some handyman work to assemble this whole product.As being a tall man, the desk stands up to 122\" which is pretty good for me to stand and work. The transition to lower and higher heights is smooth and works without issue.Overall, I'd recommend the company to ensure that the assembly parts holes and screws line up properly. Otherwise, it is a good product to purchase and use.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was hesitant with some of the other reviews, but this savvy single mama set it up in under an hour and the electrical works just fine. Smooth transition even with triple monitor, and comes with cable ties to keep the chords that operate the desk in place. The start to stop motion is gentle and response is quick. My first order did arrive damaged (looked like poor handling in the winter weather during shipping) but the seller was responsive and quickly replaced the desk. I have been very pleased and have had no issues with it since the replacement arrived. The instructions are minimal at best, so I highly suggest watching the sellers video for set up and use common sense while building it! (don\u2019t tighten all your screws before you have the others placed or they may not align with their holes, set yourself up with enough time and patience to get the desktop together as it took working section by section back and forth doing it alone\u2014 or get someone to help you if you can.)",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical getting any table from Amazon but this purchase turned out great! The box came in tack and with all the pieces it needed. It was a heavy big box.My husband said the assembly was easy or maybe he is just used to building things. The instructions was ok to understand but then like I said, my husband has seen worse instructions he said.The table top came in two pieces so it\u2019s not a one piece table top. I really needed this for my home work station as working from home seems to be the norm now. I have a bad back so standing helps then sitting for 8 hours all day.The motor is pretty quiet and the button display is sleek. Looks expensive. It\u2019s actually similar to what I have at the office. I can later replace the table top for a bit bigger desk. I thought it was worth the purchase.",

I read and studied the instruction diagrams and illustrations carefully before attaching each piece to the main part. The desk is sturdy, and I like the memory presets for the height adjustments. Overall it's a well made desk.",

I had to settle for an awkward arm position that doesn't bend the top as much....maybe the top should be made with thicker material or better aupport....",

                "reviewText": "Wish I would have made a video of putting this together. It was fairly simple, but I got stuck on two steps. I would recommend that you put the two bars on first before you put the rod on.I think it was step 3 or 4, this way it\u2019s held up sturdy enough to put the rod in. Of course that\u2019s just me hahahahaaThe motor works great, it\u2019s a smooth transition and easy to make the saved setting.The box came with all the tools you need, but the screwdriver is a one shot use only. I used my drill on a slow speed.Would recommend to shoppers, but know this there aren\u2019t many videos on putting it together.",
