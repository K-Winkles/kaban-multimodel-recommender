You have to disassemble the WHOLE pkg, & miss the four parts packed within each other under ALL the wood pieces.Once together, I was quite pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I figured out the assembly pretty easily and everything was marked ok but the drawers were not lining up. I still don't have them in a usable manner yet as once you close the drawer it is STUCK. I cannot get them to open again without almost tearing the whole thing apart. Not real happy with that. I like the monitor stand part and the rest of the desk is nice and seems sturdy. The light is ok except when I was applying it half of the sticky part ripped right off so I had to use something else to attach it. Overall I like the look of it but hopefully I can get the drawer problem sorted out.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased 2 of these desk to suite our particular needs. The assembly isn't difficult but it is precise. All the parts a labeled. When constructing the desk you need to be aware of the orientation of the rods. The holes in the rods accommodate the bolts and screws. However, if you make a mistake, lie we did a couple times, making the corrections is easy.It is a heavy stable desk with a small drawer that accommodates a desk organizer and a file drawer that will accommodate small or legal hanging file folders. The drawer isn't particularly deep but is is sufficient if you don't have a tremendous number of folders.I like that the monitor sits above the desk top which give me full use of the desk top. The desk top sits at a good hight form myself and my husband. There is adequate shelf space and an open grate shelf if you need to put a CPU somewhere that needs some air circulation.Overall, we are happy with the purchase. I feel that it is appropriately priced considering the quality and the precision that it has.",

                "reviewText": "The desk looks really nice, and I love all the storage space! It makes work for me a lot easier. The monitor stand seems a little high for me, but I need to check if I can adjust my monitor first. Now, the biggest con for me was the assembly. I\u2019ve assembled many things like this before, so I assumed this would be no different. It took me about 4 hours to assemble and I had to back track several times to make sure that I got it right. The drawers still don\u2019t fit quite right. I\u2019ll have to see what I missed to fix them. The instructions were okay, but for me it was easy to miss some of holes on the instructions meaning that sometimes it was upside down. Overall a good product, but I would have appreciated clearer instructions.Update: I\u2019ve had this desk for about a year now, and it\u2019s not that sturdy. I mentioned before how the drawers didn\u2019t fit right, and as hard as I tried they never did fit and eventually broke due to me trying to fix them. I still like the desk, I replaced the drawers with some sterilite plastic ones but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d buy this desk again.",
