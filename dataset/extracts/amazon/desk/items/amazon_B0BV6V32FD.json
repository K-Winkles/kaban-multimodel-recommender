Compared to some options that are approaching $1000 this desk really gets the job done without breaking the bank. The motor has given me zero issues so far after around 3 months of usage.Pretty easy to assemble instructions are actually quite clear thankfully. Will definitely be easier with a second person if you happen to have one available but can be done solo. The lights are an enjoyable touch for anyone that enjoys changeable lighting. Overall would definitely recommend this desk. Being able to stand up when my body is crying out to not be stuck sitting any longer when actually working at the desk is a serious game changer.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best customer service I've ever experienced on Amazon (plus a few notes on dimensions)",
                "reviewText": "I've never purchased a desk sight-unseen and was highly wary of doing so, but based on the cost, good reviews, and L-shaped style with some extras (including the keyboard tray) I was willing to give it a try. Upon receiving the desk I was very impressed with the packing. It's heavy but very fortified inside to keep parts from being damaged.The instructions were very straightforward (for once) and well written. Also, I was very impressed by the build quality. Although the desk is pressboard/fiberboard with a laminate top, it looks good and feels solid. All of the screws and metal parts are machined very nicely and fit snugly. This feels like a desk from a higher-end manufacture. It's not amazing, but definitely very good quality.It does take some time to put this together (lots and lots of allen wrench screws) but once constructed it feels solid and looks great. A couple of things to note about the size:- The bottom or 'desk' portion is only about 19.5\" deep.- The top or 'monitor' shelf is about 7.5\" deep.- Because of the design and top shelf overlap you have about 22 1/4\" from the front of the desk to the back of the top shelf.- Also, due to the design, there is a 2\" gap of desk space underneath the top shelf (see photos). In other words, the bracket that holds the top shelf sticks back from the desktop about 2\". This is a strange design choice to me as you could add another 2\" to the desk surface under the top shelf and not have the brackets stick out further. It might look cool, but is definitely somewhat less functional. I am debating cutting a 2\" strip of plywood, painting it black, and securing it to the brackets to extend the desktop area. This way I could slide my computer, speakers and other items a bit further back and have more 'desktop' space.All that being said, I'm extremely happy with this desk. Most importantly, I am extremely happy with the customer service I received from Rolanstar (via the Amazon email/contact seller link). Initially, when I adjusted the legs up or down there was a loud 'clunk' before the legs started moving. I reached out to customer service and they were very quick to respond and help me solve the issue. It took a few back and forths to figure out the best solution but they were always very friendly and accommodating. I did have to wait some time for replacement parts to arrive, but again, they were quick to help and this has truly been the best customer service experience I've ever had on Amazon!I did install the LEDs under the top shelf and they're kinda cool (though I debated whether to bother installing at all) but, due to the glossy nature of the laminate, the single LEDs can be seen as little dots along the the desk. It'd be much nicer if these were diffused in some way. Or, just don't bother installing them.At any rate, I have my fingers crossed this desk will work well into the future. As of now, it sure feels like it will. I'd say if you are on the fence, take a chance.",

As for the original review: the company was quick to get me a copy of the instructions. If I remember correctly, they emailed them over the same day I contacted them. Customer service has been amazing so far!Original review: Product arrived earlier than expected. Which would\u2019ve been great.. except that there are no instructions or manual in the box. So my excitement for my new desk was quickly squashed by frustration. I did try to call and email, but have not received a response yet.

                "reviewText": "this product is SOOO GREAT for the price and feature it provides, I wont say more than what had been shared with other 5 stars reviews (I agree with them), however the ONLY challenge to assemble by yourself is the part of the motor leg and attach it to the table, it requires either a second person or a real flat surface (carpet will NEVER help). other than that, all other 5 stars reviews did the job.thanx for the product and the support",
