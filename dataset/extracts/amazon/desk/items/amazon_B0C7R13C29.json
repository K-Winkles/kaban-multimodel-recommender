I guess it\u2019s my fault for not checking measurement\u2019s, but the desk is more on the shorter side which forces me to buy an additional monitor stand so I can view my monitor level with my eyes. Everything else though I\u2019m happy with my purchase",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Assembly was a trainwreck. I normally have no issues assembling furniture, but I dissassembled parts of this 4 times before it all finally fit together. The veneer covering shows every finger and hand print and I can already see the veneer will be wearing off on the edges of the tabletops. Poorly veneered. Also one of the drawers is too big to fit in its slot. I had too crunch it and pretty much smashed it in. Probably won't be able to use that drawer. The functionaly of the desk is good though. I like having the extra outlets, very handy. There is plenty of work space for a couple 22 inch monitors, a keyboard and mouse. The other section has plenty ofbstorahe space and countertop space for printers, lamps, a second computer... overall, this desknwill serve its purpose. No wow factors here, but very functional. Quality of the table tops could be better, but add a couple desktop covers and that should help protect the poor quality of the veneer.",
