                "reviewText": "First desk: the holes in the bottom of the desk top did not line up with the frame, so half the desk isn't screwed down.Second desk: the side support bar is missing the piece that the screw screws into, so I wasn't able to install it. The bottom drawer pushes the supports for the top drawer out of place. The shelf was dented.Both desks: FYI, the desk top is two pieces, not a solid piece. Due to screws sticking out in the back from the upper frame, the top drawer cannot be pushed all the way in. I ended up cutting spaces for the screws. The top drawer front comes up too high and you have to push hard to fully close the drawer. The screws for the side baskets are too short. I fully expect it to fall frequently. The drawer supports pop out of place if you remove the drawer. Why I'm not returning them... because I'm a good problem solver, my daughters like them, and they will do, but I DO NOT recommend anyone else purchase them.",
