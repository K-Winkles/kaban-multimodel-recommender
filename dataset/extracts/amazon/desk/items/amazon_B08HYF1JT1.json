                "reviewText": "I've had this desk for about seven months, and it's held up well !I spent MONTHS trying to find the best desk that fit my needs. I'm a student and have a full-time job that is 60% remote. I could not keep working on the bed or an end table. I wanted a sizable desk that would fit my 16-inch Lenovo laptop and 27-inch HP 27mq monitor and still provide me with enough arm space to write on a few notebooks.I love the simplicity of this desk, both in aesthetics and functionality. I had a hand-me-down secretary desk; I hated it; it was large and bulky and had a billion drawers that took up most of the desk space, leaving very little room when I had my laptop and journals on it.This desk is adjustable, but I have never used it. I currently use a dining table chair, so I adjusted the desk's height accordingly and have had no reason to change it. It's stable; it wobbles if you write super aggressively or physically shake the edge of the table, you can see the monitor screen shake a bit. But the structure itself is terrific! It does not at all wobble at the feet. Also, I spilled acetone on it once, and it didn't ruin the finish of the table at all, so yay, lol :)Assembly took around half an hour and was easy to assemble. There are many pieces, but the instructions were very clear. I would suggest using a drill to speed things up, but also, there are 2 or 4 screws that are supposed secure the middle bar to the table, and there are no premade holes. The legs don't have premade holes either, but it wasn't a big deal as there wasn't any space between them. Since there's some space between that middle bar and the underside of the table, it's hard to screw by hand.I definitely recommend this desk to anyone who likes the minimal look. It's sturdy, reliable, and spacious.In general, I would love to see more sizing options; this one is 28 inches deep and 55 inches wide. I initially wanted a 32x62-inch desk, so I compromised a bit. I found a couple of options within that size, but they were too bulky, had two tabletop pieces, or sported two different colored finishes. I wanted a completely solid white color as I didn't want to darken my room, so I bought this one, and I don't regret it at all. :)",

                "reviewText": "Desk was on sale and bought the Maple 55 inch.Ships in two shipments, the top and the motorized bottom.Not too bad to put together. Instructions are clear, however it does say to adjust the crossbar early on in instructions. But you aren't going to be able to do that until you are mounting to the top so you can line the holes up. So I would just ignore that step or make it a little wider to give you some working room.Once it comes time to mount the top do one screw top/bottom on one side. Then loosen the crossbar and transmission rod and extend until until you lined up the other side with the holes. Once all screwed in tighten the rod and crossbar.One thing I think would have helped was a guide on where the center of the crossbar extension was so you could extend it in a balanced way. I just eyeballed it. Most the weight is going to go to the legs anyway so not concerned.As far as predrilled holes go, they lined up perfectly on left/right side. There is no predrilled holes for the crossbar however you don't need a drill the wood is soft enough to just screw into with a bit of force.Theres also no predrilled hole for the back of the up/down switch but again not a problem. Theres plenty of holes to position the switch where you want (though it must be on the right side of the desk near the motor since the cords aren't that long).One other nitpick is the bracket that holds the power adapter doesn't lock into place. It just slides around freely. Being nitpicky though its not a functional problem.All pieces were there. The top looks really nice but it isn't heavy enough to be solid maple. But all put together the desk has good weight and very sturdy. Motor works well, I actually didn't even buy it for being a standing desk so thats a bonus. It was a good price even if it didn't have that feature.Pros:-sturdy and good weight to it-motor is enough to do the job.-not bad to put together. No frustrating moments. Takes about an hour. Only need a sturdy philips screwdriver no drill needed.-top is one solid piece-its deep! Most cheaper desks are 20-24 inches. 28 inches is a very noticeable difference.-good price-the desk gets very tall, I was surprised. I am 6'2 and it got more than tall enough for me.Cons-couple of nitpicks about instructionsWell see how long it lasts but so far am satisfied.",

Assembling was easy for the most part, just confusing as some instructions are missing, I had to watch the Youtube tutorial and read the comments to build it correctly. I got the 55x28 in and I feel this is the perfect size if you plan to use it for productivity and some gaming. The desk does shake a little while I am typing but it does not bother me as I believe the price is just right.",

                "reviewText": "Joining the standing desk trend, I recently got myself the Flexispot Standing Desk, and I must say, it's been quite the surprise! Having experienced other brands like PrimeCable, the Flexispot desk truly stands out in terms of both quality and value.1. Unbeatable Quality and Price Ratio:Compared to my previous PrimeCable desk, the Flexispot Standing Desk easily holds its own in terms of build quality. The fact that it comes at such a pocket-friendly price point makes it even more impressive. You're getting top-notch quality without the premium price tag.2. Effortless Assembly with Pre-Drilled Holes:One feature that instantly won me over is the pre-drilled holes on the desktop. Unlike my previous assembly experiences, where I'd spend ages measuring and crossing my fingers for accurate placements, the Flexispot desk made it a breeze. Attaching accessories like monitor arms or cable management systems was a walk in the park.3. Small Touches Matter: Rubber Grommets:The desk's attention to detail shines through with the rubber grommets that accompany each pre-drilled hole. Not only does this add a touch of elegance to the design, but it also prevents any potential damage to the desktop. It's these small considerations that set the Flexispot desk apart.4. Unwavering Stability:Stability is a deal-breaker when it comes to standing desks, and the Flexispot model doesn't disappoint. Even during intense typing or height adjustments, the desk remains remarkably steady. This level of stability has significantly improved my work experience, allowing me to focus entirely on tasks.5. Enhanced Durability with Protective Bearing System:A standout feature is the inclusion of a protective board for the bearing system. This added safeguard ensures that the internal components remain protected from dust and other particles, extending the desk's overall lifespan and ensuring smooth, quiet adjustments.",
