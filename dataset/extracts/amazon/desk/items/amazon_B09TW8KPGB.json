                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble--just open it up and its ready to go! The 27.3\" size fits my 15\" Macbook Air with a small mousepad and mouse. Its very sturdy (does not feel like it will collapse at all ) but it does tip easily if you bump the front as the weight is at the back of the desk. I think that if you set it against a wall this won't be an issue but you have to be careful if using it freestanding I bought this for a small kitchen table in my apartment but will also use it as a laptop desk.",

My house has a lot of rooms that I move around in, and having the ability to fold this table up and move it into whatever room I'm camped out in for the day is really great! I've used it as extra counter space when working in the kitchen. I used it as an actual computer desk during a recent Zoom meeting. I used it as a sort of TV tray to eat dinner on in front of the tv. It's a tad heavy because of the solid construction, but not so much that it can't be folded and moved easily. Plus, the fact that it does fold flat and can be stored out of site is great! I gave one to my SIL for Christmas, and she was so excited to be able to move it around her house to do her arts and crafts on from any room.",
