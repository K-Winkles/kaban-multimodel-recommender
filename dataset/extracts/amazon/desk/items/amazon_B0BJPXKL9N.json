The L-shaped layout and the monitor stand make my workspace feel so organized and spacious, plus the extra shelves are a lifesaver for keeping my printer and office stuff within easy reach.Putting it together was a breeze, and once it was all set up, I could feel how sturdy and well-made it is. It's clear they used quality materials. And can we talk about the sleek look? It fits right in with my decor and gives my workspace a stylish boost.Honestly, for the price, this desk is a steal. It's not just about how it looks\u2014it's improved my productivity and made my workday so much smoother. If you want to upgrade your home office without breaking the bank, this desk is absolutely worth it",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a desk with more space, and also a way to lift my monitor without having to use a bunch of books! The old desk I was using had a hutch, so I was limited on how big a monitor I could use. I also had limited space on the desktop, so I couldn\u2019t put my printer OR scanner on the desktop. The printer was on the top of the hutch, which made it difficult to add paper, change ink, etc. now I have a lot of space; the printer and scanner both fit on the desktop easily. I haven\u2019t even begun to put things on the side shelves yet! The only thing I would change is putting adjustable height legs. I really wanted to put that file cabinet under the desk, but a: it was slightly taller than the desk, and b: the support bar on the desk goes across the middle of it.Assembly was fairly simple, with lot of extra screws and bolts. All the parts were well labeled, and the nuts, bolts, and screws were in numbered, sealed bags instead of the cardboard bubbles. The instructions can be a bit difficult to understand, but I managed to get through it all! This is definitely a two-person job\u2026though you might be able to assemble it alone if you have room to lay the desk on its side.",

                "reviewText": "Overall happy with this desk feels decently solid and the shelves are a nice addition to the functionality of it. The assembly had good instructions and only took about an hour. Was a bit difficult doing it myself as there are a couple steps that I had to balance against the parts against a wall to do it myself. Only gripe was one of the support bars to keep the legs from spreading was not in the box so I need to be careful when moving it. And as I had already had unboxed and assembled nearly the whole thing i was left with the choice of completely taking it apart and trying to rebox it to send back to amazon as thay don't send out parts. So I decided to leave as is",

                "reviewText": "This desk is such a great value. If you follow the instructions, it's very clear what to do and how to do it. The first time I ordered this, it came with a defective piece, and I reached out to the manufacturer. They responded quickly, asked for an explanation and a picture, and promptly sent me an entire new desk, free of charge, instead of making me wait multiple weeks to get the individual part of the desk shipped separately. I couldn't have asked for a smoother or easier process for a problem I couldn't have solved on my own. It went together smoothly that time, and all is well.I use it every day and it's awesome. Sturdy, sleek, and very utilitarian. With all of the thin legs, as well as the cross bars along the back sides, it's very easy to cable manage and get everything all tidied up. I have a serious amount of cables, and they are all at least somewhat neat (with the help of some adhesive hook and loop (velcro) tape, J-channel, and a ton of reusable cable ties). I have no complaints.",

At first I felt that MAYBE the bookshelf would be too much, but actually it\u2019s perfect, and currently houses a few things I didn\u2019t think about.Easy to build, and instructions to follow. Gives you two options in the instructions on how to build the desk to your needs (Left facing or Right facing) which was REALLY neat to have that option.I would recommend furniture sliders if this is on carpet, because you\u2019re going to be moving it into place, and you don\u2019t want the desk to potentially break. I have super plush carpet though, so maybe just me.Wish it came with RGB light strips but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker.Overall, one of the coolest desks I\u2019ve bought, and I plan to have it for some time to come",

The instruction booklet was very helpful and the pieces fit together rather easily. I would however suggest not to screw in everything 100% when putting on the actual table top on to the desk as sometimes it needs to be maneuvered a bit so the screws can fit into their slots. The desk itself is a good quality and the shelf once connected to the desk is very sturdy.",
