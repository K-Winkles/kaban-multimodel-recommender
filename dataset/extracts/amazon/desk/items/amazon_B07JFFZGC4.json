                "reviewText": "PHOTOSYeah, I need to do some cord management. Yeah, son's room is messy.LIKES1. Very solid desk.2. Very quiet and fast motor operation.3. Scratch-resistant surface.4. The memory features for sit and stand are nice and easy to operate. They will give my son a chance to stand and burn off some energy while remote learning by just pushing one button, ensuring ergonomic consistency.DISKLIKES1. Surface of desk is prone to fingerprints.2. [minor] While the three settings for height memory are nice, it would have been nicer to have four. Assuming the most common use cases are \"sit\" and \"stand\", the third setting seems like a third wheel on a hot date. Having four settings would have better accommodated two people's sit and stand preferences.3. The \"screen saver\" function is bit weird. After 90 seconds the control panelthat displays the height will instead show \"---\" (apparently the screensaver, like that's so much more efficient than showing the number) and not accept any input. In order to use the desk again you have to press \"M\" for three seconds. But then after 10 minutes the whole display shuts off and you have to press the display to turn it on. It is supposed to prevent accidental pressing of buttons, but that seems like an edge case to me and less-intuitive redundancy to the power-off feature.SHIPPINGFor me the desk came in two different boxes which wasn't indicated in the tracking. One box contained the three paneled top, which I received first. Then a few days later the motorized stand came. The boxes were in bad shape, but all of the parts were there and the pieces were well-packaged.ASSEMBLYAssembly was fairly straight-forward. But here are a few things to look out for:1. When assembling the motorized stand you have to adjust the width to match the top in one of the early steps; however at that stage you don't know what exact width it needs to be to align with the holes on the top. So I recommend not tightening the slider part until the end after you put the top on so you can finely adjust the underlying frame's width to align with the top's screw holes. So for me I finely adjusted the width after putting the top on and tightened the slider. Then I installed the variable-length metal rod for the motor last.2. There were no instructions for the top, but it wasn't too hard to figure out. Line up the three panels on the floor upside down (screw holes showing) with the rectangular piece in the middle and all cord-management holes aligned. Then you'll see that the two supplied bars lay across all three panels and align with the holes.3. Before putting on the top, the instructions say to put these sticky pads with holes in them over the frame screw holes for padding. However, those white pads were thick and once the top was on the screws to screw from the frame into the top weren't long enough to get a bite with that pad in-between. Removing the pads with great vengeance and furious anger caused the screws to then go in quite easily.4. The control panel (where you push the buttons up and down) has two holes to secure it to the underside of the desk. However, the hole pattern under the desk didn't match the hole pattern for the control panel. So you can utilize one of the desktop holes in the pattern for an easy screw-in. For the other hole you'll have to use one of the supplied pointy screws to drill into the underside of the desk. If you don't have a drill then your options are more limited. But I think a piece of 3M double-sided stick pad or double sided tape would work just fine. It's light.",

I would suggest building it on an elevated surface (not the floor) if possible. Even with help, the metal legs are very heavy. Just be careful when building this desk and avoid my mistakeOverall, I really like this desk and I\u2019m very glad that I bought it. I work from home and have found it so much better to be able to switch positions throughout the day/night. Love the size and range, thankful for their customer service. I also love the contoured version and wouldn\u2019t want to go back to a rectangular table top or non-standing desk. Just be wary of wobbliness and be careful when building if you\u2019re already dealing with back pain like I am.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews but I was so happy with this purchase I decided to write one. This desk met all my expectations and delivered beyond that. I received the desk last week and set it up last Friday. Overall 5 stars but I only gave four stars on the assembly because the directions were not as good as they could be. On the plus side I called their customer service once at 5pm on Friday - they answered! and chatted a online a second time around 6 (open Mon-Fri till 7pm). They were super responsive and cleared things up both times. The desk went together GREAT and is solid.Features I think are worth noting and considering:Desktop. This desk is 31.5\" deep - many are only 24 inches... thats a big difference - this one is 30% deeper. Gives me plenty of space in front of my monitors and keyboard. The length is 63\" - again great working space. It feels super comfortable. to work on and leaves plenty of room. I have the black surface and really like it - cleans up easy and seems very durable.Cable Management: Excellent rating here. With my double monitor set up I am sooo glad there are three (3) cable ports in the desk top. I wouldn't have looked for that- but glad I have it. The under-table cable management tray is a good size as well and hold almost everything I have to stuff in there.Electric raising system: Not sure why the transformer for the motor has to be so large - it fits in the cable tray but takes up about 1/3 of the tray. The memory position system works great. Raise and Lower function is smooth and quiet. I was going to a pneumatic raise and lower - so glad I didn't- this works really nice - hope it lasts- seems solid. Lastly a feature I didnt think about was the timer... you can set a timer on the control to remind you to switch from sit/stand. That is really actually very useful.So this was a recent purchase so I am hoping reliability is good - but I have found products so well thought out with features usually are well engineered too... if anything goes south I'll get back on here with an update.",

Very smooth and quiet motor functions. Plenty of room for everything including the pc. This is a 38 inch ultra wide on my desk. Easily can handle the weight. The only 2 complaints I have and not really a big deal the table might not be right for everyone unless you don't mind sitting higher up. At its lowest point is roughly 30 inches. And my second gripe is the separation on the the table itself is not perfectly flush so where the cuts in the table top join together run on my wrists. Other than that nothing but good things it's a fantastic gaming table great for long sessions. And if you get tired of sitting just raise it up with a simple touch and you can now have a standing work station. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Happy with this purchase, love being able to sit/stand on a moment's notice, my back/legs/nerves are appreciative. The base is heavy and fairly solid, only slight wobble when the desk is raised up near it's maximum (which is way higher than I will ever need), the curved front edge helps get closer to 2nd monitor and gives a little extra useable space, but not a ton, would almost rather just have a few inches deeper and rectangular.Having the top split into 3 pieces is good for delivery but assembling the 3 pieces together was more difficult than expected, the metal blocks used to connect them are very difficult to thread the screws through because of the plastic washer inserts - had to spend a long time finagling the screws into place. The top is sturdy enough but fairly thin and plastically feeling.The touchscreen controller is adequate however it sometimes takes multiples of taps (like 5 or 6) to get it to wake, once awake the touch sensitivity is decent. The length of included cabling is quite limited to where you can mount the controller so they probably should just have pre-drilled the holes in the ideal location from the factory.The included cable management works well though I wish the holes through the top were set further back and in a different position so I could put my monitor further back - it interferes with the monitor stand, If you used a different monitor stand it might not be an issue.I would buy this again but not at a higher price than the $399CAD I paid for it.",
