I love the little L shape, it goes right next to my couch and also acts as a little side table. I do wish the desk was a little deeper, but it is okay. The set up was easy and straight forward, I didn't have any issues putting it together myself. Unfortunately my floor happens to be a little uneven apparently so I did have to add a little stabilizer at the bottom of one on of the legs so it doesn't wobble. Overall, I think its a good price point for a small L shaped desk.",
