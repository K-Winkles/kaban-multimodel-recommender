I love the design\u2019s simplicity and black sleek appearance. It\u2019s perfect for the space! I ordered a 47 and the smaller 32 and kinda made a L shape with them so everything would fit and it does. Easy to put together in just a few minutes and easy to move around but very sturdy.",

I used washers for the mounting bolts because I feel they're too long and may push through the top when tightened.OK, for a desk color to be called Espresso, it sure looks Black to me.The shipping package was in near perfect condition. So I find it a little confusing why the edging on both long sides show wear.As you can see in the last pic, with all my computer peripherals on the desk it's a bit crowded.But I will be placing the tower on a floor stand.As for the finish, if the edge's show wear from shipping...I can't see the Espresso/black finish holding up in the long run.I would say this is the perfect size for a laptop and a small wireless printer!I'm happy with my purchase.",
