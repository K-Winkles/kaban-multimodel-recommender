                "reviewText": "I bought this on a flash sale on black Friday for a great price (139.00). I have to say it's worth it at that price point. The assembly wasn't hard, but it did take a few hours and I think either I swapped some screws or they gave me more of the long screws and not enough of the top screws. Either way, there was plenty of screws so unless something really terrible happens the table tops will not be leaving the desk of their own accord. There are instructions for having the long side on either the left or the right, and the whole thing is sturdy.The desk looks good. I'd say the only gripes are that the computer sits where my foot rest used to be so i keep almost kicking the computer during longer gaming sessions, and there's only 3 plugs on the little power strip that sits on top. I can't tell if it's a surge protector either. Since your computer sits underneath, you may have some issues reaching the power button (especially for me since my computer case has RGB and a window so i had to put it in with the power button in the rear corner of the desk). It may sound like I'm not enjoying the product, but i moved up from folding utility table desk to this one so I'm still pretty satisfied, besides if I had installed it with the left side longer orientation i wouldn't have the power button shoved into the corner.",

Took hubby and my son about half hour to assemble it, had a couple of confusing moments with parts but otherwise is sturdy and the perfect amount of room for two monitors, keyboard, mouse pad, mic system (got all that for Christmas too) and he still has plenty of desk space with all that on top. The shelf space is a bonus for controllers, headset etc. Would highly recommend.....",
