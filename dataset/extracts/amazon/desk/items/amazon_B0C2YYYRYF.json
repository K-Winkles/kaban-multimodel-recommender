It comes in a lot of pieces, so assembly took a while, but was straigtforward and the instructions were fine. We needed a compact computer desk, and this works great - the shelves are handy for storage, looks nice, and is surprisingly sturdy. I wouldn't recommend putting a lot of weight on it, especially on carpet, given how small it is - but it's been fine with a monitor, laptop, keyboard and mouse.",

I researched many, many desks and finally decided on this one. I have 2 tables and a larger desk from this company, and my husband also has a desk from this same company and they are very sturdy and look nice in their rooms. My husband says they were relatively easy to assemble and that was another important reason to purchase this desk. The person who will be putting it together is not as experienced at assembling things and my husband says she should have no problems. Can't wait to see a picture of the desk in her bedroom.",
