I\u2019m always worried these products would come with damages, but nothing was dinged or scratched that I know of. OH AND THE FABRIC DRAWERS DO NOT SMELL AT ALL. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I\u2019ve ordered products with fabric shelves from amazon before and it would have an unpleasant smell to them that don\u2019t go away no matter how much I spray them :\u2019(The desk seems a little short, but I haven\u2019t gone around to get a chair for it yet so that not a big deal. No missing screws and they provide the tools needed to make assembly easy. Oh. There were actually two instances when the screws were a little hard to put in because of the alignment, but a little force allowed for entry. Overall very happy with my beautiful desk with lovely storage space. It was such a good price too.",

                "reviewText": "This was a great buy if you're on a budget. Power strip is a nice added feature. Not too big. I wish it had a raised shelf on the lower side but it's okay. Sturdy. Simple instructions for the most part.... installation may have worked my last nerve. it's a lot to put together but I did it by myself and wasn't anything crazy. I will say, do not tighten any screws all the way until you know you can align all the screws for that piece first..not even a little bit. Getting the desk pieces to align with the screw holes was a bit of a struggle (actually I may have threatened to throw it out a few times lol) and if you had tightened anything, it wouldn't line up. So learn from the person who had to loosen every single screw just to get another one to line up...Sturdy. Metal frame. the top which is a pressed wood I'm assuming but Defintely is not as cheap feeling as I had thought. The drawers are a fabric drawer like you would use in a cube storage so no, they are not going to be good quality drawers but again for the price, it's just fine. Can be put together in two separate styles. Definitely worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "The desk is sturdy, the assembly is straight forward, and it looks great.I was expecting a flimsy aluminum alloy, cheap press board, and brittle screws. But everything is much higher quality than that. It feels like a more expensive desk, which is great.One thing to note, the arrangement of the desk is not as customizable as I was hoping. The desk only has two configurations, either straight or L shaped, and its not like the seller promised more than that. But the way it's designed, the shorter desk is always going to be on the left side no matter which side you arrange the taller desk. I was hoping to be able to switch it around at my convenience. I had already made a floor plan with this desk in mind, but that limitation really threw a wrench into the works. However, it was redeemable.The desk doesn't take up too much space at all, and it's still has a decent surface area to work on. Because of that, I was able to change up my floor plan to accommodate the desk without any major issues.Overall, a really good product.",
