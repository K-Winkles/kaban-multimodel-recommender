The instructions could be a little clearer but honestly, if I can put it together, you can too. It was pretty easy to follow, just unclear in some parts and which material is which. I love it and highly recommend it. It looks very nice in my office.",

Pros: Solid build, Easy to assemble, accommodates a variety of table sizes, smooth lower/raise motion.Cons: Could have used an extra hardware attachment hole on the table support.I turned my old 36x39\" dining table into my computer stand. I needed the width to accommodate my two 27\" vertical mounted LG monitors and my desktop computer while having enough table space for my keyboard, Ipad and Phone table mount.I was worried the table support width was too short to fit the 39\" side of the table; it worked out perfectly.My next concern was the combined weight of the table itself, two 27\" monitors, monitor stands, desktop computer, drink decanter, and all the other items on my desk which added to approximately 110lbs. The motor handle the weight very well.This stand only has up or down and no memory feature, however, I really don't need it since i keep the table height the same 90% of the time.Overall, worth the $100 to personalize a standing desk.",
