                "reviewText": "This standing desk has proven to be a smart buy with its fair pricing, easy installation, and attractive design that enhances any workspace. The secure packaging ensures it arrives in pristine condition, and its quiet operation makes height adjustments seamless without causing disruptions. Ideal for those trying standing desks for the first time, it provides a positive and accessible introduction to this ergonomic solution. While I'm uncertain about its long-term durability, its current sturdiness and construction quality inspire confidence in its reliability. The desk not only encourages healthy habits by promoting better posture but also offers versatile adjustability to cater to various working positions. It's particularly well-suited for beginners, making it a valuable addition to any office or home setup.",

                "reviewText": "This desk is a great value. It is easy to assemble, it took about 45 minutes and needed just a philips head screwdriver. The instructions were clear, and there were even 'extra' fasteners included, and clearly labled. None were needed, the counts in all of the bags were correct and I didn't loose any :-) This is not a finely crafted piece of heirloom furniture, the desktop itself is a composite with a woodgrain print on it that look fine, and should be quite durable. The height adjustment mechanism works smoothly and quietly. All in all, this is a very low cost, but highly functional standing desk if you have a small working space.",

I purchased this standing desk since I work from home and live in a pretty small apartment (<600 sq feet) So I needed something that would fit easily in my bedroom but still had enough room for both my large monitor and laptop. It was easy to put together and only took an hour or two. Does get a tad wobbly, if at full standing height, but to be expected for the price and nothing that noticeable. Would definitely buy again.",

I recommend having someone help you if possible, but if not, you'll be ok. I like the look of it, and the buttons make it so easy to use. I also like that you can select settings; I have one for sitting, one for standing, and another for standing with a treadmill. I do wish it had a little more storage, but overall, this is a 5/5 stars!",

I talked to the owner of the company who insisted that company policy means that he needs my credit card to issue a temporary credit before sending out any warranty repairs so if I decided not to keep the desk he would refund it? Rather than doing through Amazon? Very confusing.Minus 1 star for ticking and 1 for the weird company policy. But I'm keeping the desk because it's a pain to assemble and its sturdy enough",
