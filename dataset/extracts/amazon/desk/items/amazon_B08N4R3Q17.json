                "reviewText": "I was in need of a large desk since my old one broke during a move to a new house and came across this cheap thing. I was skeptical, but funds were tight, so I had to bite the bullet and go for it. The desk came without any blemishes and with extra parts in case I lost a piece somehow. The frame looked thin and was light in my hands and the wooden desk itself was the same, but my previous desk was made of thick steel so I'm used to something with a little more meat on its bones.A friend and I put the desk together. According to the reviews here, people complained about the screws not being labeled. This is not true. Each piece is labeled and they are listed in the instructions. While the instructions could have been clearer, they sufficed, and we got this desk built within the hour.Using this desk, I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality. The desk was sturdy and didn't wobble or wiggle, each leg was properly balanced, and the table had ample room. The wood quality was rather nice and didn't seem like it would peel easy, but there's still time for this piece of furniture to show its true quality. There was a gap between the big and little board and the desk isn't really wide (my last desk was 60 x 30, this one is 60 , 24), but aside from that I have no complaints. For 80 dollars, this desk is pretty nice. I'd recommend getting something else if you have the money as the thin board and legs are worrisome, but if you're in a pinch, you can't go wrong with this desk.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Small desk with lots of room",
                "reviewText": "The desk I replaced with this one was almost exactly the same size and layout but somehow this desk has given me more desk space to work with. Part of this is that the materials make it feel bigger and part of it is the fact that the two shelves on the side give you more room to put things under the desk thus giving you more room on the desk.I use my desk as part of a home recording studio setup and I also have to use it to work from home 3 days a week for my day job. This desk has allowed me to situate things so that my audio interface can be moved off the top of the desk and to the top shelf on the side and the bottom is used for a small printer and my collection of notebooks. There's also space on the shelves to switch out my wireless keyboards, mice, and laptops so I can switch between work and music mode easily. During work I have plenty of room for my large wireless keyboard with number pad and mouse with room to spare for papers and notebooks. I have an external monitor that I use for both work and personal use which is held up by a monitor stand that clamps to the desktop and lets me move the monitor around without the stand taking up any desk space. To free up more space I have two of those generic 4 legged aluminum laptop stands stacked one on top of the other. I use those to place my laptop (open) on top next to my external monitor so I get a two monitor setup. Since there's two of these stands stacked one on top of the other I essentially get a shelf below the laptop and then below that is the actual desktop itself. I use this to hide an Amazon Echo placed atop an Apple external superdrive and I can also put external hard drives which I use often in my music production down there as well. There's even room for a small USB-C/Thunderbolt docking station. Beneath that, on the desktop itself, I keep whichever notebook I'm currently using or my iPad when I'm not using them.On the first shelf beneath the desktop I keep my Scarlett 18i8 interface at the front (which fits perfectly there with maybe a centimeter or two to spare) facing directly forward. Behind that is where I keep whichever laptop I'm not using at the time. My 13\" Macbook Pro fits neatly behind it but my 17\" Lenovo work laptop doesn't fit as neatly behind there. It hangs off the sides a little and the cables behind the interface sometimes get in the way a bit but it's a small price to pay. I keep that shelf pretty clear so there's nothing but the interface and laptop not in use there because I need to be able to quickly switch them out. The harder it is to switch modes the less likely I am to actually make music.On the lower shelf is where I have a small label thermal printer which I use for printing mailing labels. I have it at the very back since I don't use it often. Next to that sits the docking station for my work laptop which I keep standing vertical to save space. In front of that, leaving enough space for the printer to print, I have three bookends which I hold all my journals and art notebooks currently in rotation between, then there's a small portable photo printer between the second and third bookend, and finally I keep whichever wireless keyboard and mouse that I'm not using propped up against that. There's also a Raspberry Pi sitting in front of all that because I don't really know where to put it yet.One trick I like to use for remotes is to put some velcro on the remotes and then on the underside of the desk. That way I can keep my remotes out of sight. There's plenty of space and depth beneath the desk to hold a good number of remotes. I have about 4 of them under there right now and they're real easy to pull out and put back and they hold basically forever.At all times I have a thin, foldable LED desk lamp/wireless phone charger in the furthest left corner of the desk with a little decorative decibel meter which extends up behind the monitor and next to the desk lamp. In front of that I keep a small cup full of pens and pencils.What I like most about this desk is that it works great for a small space. I mentioned before that I had a desk of the exact same size but somehow this one simply has more room. I'm able to keep the desktop clear of a lot of permanent things that I used to not have a place for. This allows me to keep the desktop as clear as possible or gives me the ability to sprawl out a few synths and papers as I work on music or other things if I'm in work mode. The desk itself is a wonderful tool in my process of switching my room from work mode to music mode very quickly and anyone who has a small office that they have to work out of knows how important it is to be able to have your tools out and available to you at a moment's notice. Being able to switch contexts fast is key to this situation. I've been able to set this desk up so that I only need to switch out my laptop, keyboard, and mouse then move the monitor plug from my work laptop to my personal one and that's it. I've just switched context within a minute or less.Anyway, that was a lot about how I specifically use this desk but the bottom line is that this is a small desk when you look at the dimensions but the way it feels is just as important. This desk absolutely gives you more space than other desks of the same dimensions. I know that doesn't sound logical but it's because of the color, type, and construction of the materials. The metal legs are also thin which gives it a sleek look and a more open feeling. Those thing legs also give you the same shelf width as other desks but more legroom because you don't have any fat wooden legs taking up space. This is definitely a roomy desk with a nice modern, minimalist look.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this for my wife's sewing machine to sit on. It is very sturdy. The bolts can be snugged up well to make it solid, but don't overtighten them as the bolt head can cave in the side of the square tubing a bit. Not a big deal, but you can over-torque it with the allen wrench included, if you try. On the right side, the top and bottom shelves are well designed for weight, but the middle shelf will not take as much due to the way it is fastened. All in all, we like it very much, and would purchase another, if needed.",
