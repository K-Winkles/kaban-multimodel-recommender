Just to give it extra durability.Table top is a smooth and seemingly tough laminate finish. Expect it to hold up well over time. Coloring is as described and nice.Be sure to wipe down before assembly. Ours arrived with a generous amount of warehouse dirt on it.Easily fits a 21\u201d monitor and a 16\u201d laptop on a riser stand with room for a small 84-key mechanical keyboard, mouse, and Anker 525 power tap.

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic and affordable portable desk. Unlike cheap folding desks, it's actually sturdy and does not wobble and seems it can take a decent amount of weight. Personally I'm using this to play keyboard/mouse games on my OLED TV, as it's quick to assemble and disassemble. The frame folds out from a flat positition, and then the desk piece locks into place on the frame using 4 plastic ring adapters that snap into place and keep it from moving. This is perfect for use with a TV as you can simply plop a wireless mouse and keyboard on it, and can use it comfortably with any office chair. Since it comes apart so quickly, you can then quickly dissassemble it and store it in a closet or under a bed, so this is also a great option for people with limited space or who need a temporary desk at say a studio apartment.Build quality overall seems very good, and I don't see this breaking or having issues over time as many cheap folding desks do. Altogether, this is the perfect portable desk at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "This desk was very easy to assemble. Four stars instead of five because I was hoping it was very easy to fold on a daily basis to tuck away. However, you have to remove the entire wooden desk portion completely before being able to fold it up. Also, in my case, one side of the desk is not flush with the metal frame, but the other side is. The frame is uneven.Overall the desk still works for my purposes and I'm happy with it. Looks nice, works great, absolutely more spacious and comfy than the \"large tv tray\" I used to use.",
