My only complaint is that the keyboard tray is only about 20\" wide, which is very narrow. If you have a full size 109-key keyboard, a mouse won't really fit next to it. If you use a tenkeyless keyboard, then you should be ok. Overall, terrific desk, my son absolutely loves it.",

I do have a few issues that I need to have addressed though. I was missing a couple of pieces and I checked the box to make sure. I love how convenient it is to have outlets on the desk but there was no hole to screw into. So my outlet can\u2019t be screwed down. Lastly, the LED lights. I love them! But, the longer side only shows the blue colors. Where the shorter side rotates all the colors. I\u2019m not sure why that is but I hope I can get it sorted soon. Otherwise, it fits perfectly in my small space which was exactly what I needed.",
