                "reviewText": "The SEDETA White Computer Desk, 63'' Corner Gaming Desk, is a practical and stylish piece of furniture designed to meet the needs of gamers and office workers alike. With a spacious work surface, smart storage solutions, and a modern design, this desk brings both functionality and style to any room.Firstly, the L-shaped design of this desk is a notable feature. It fits neatly into a corner, maximizing space efficiency in smaller rooms. The 63'' length provides ample space for multiple monitors, a keyboard, a mouse, and other essential items, making it an excellent choice for a gaming setup or a home office.The desk comes with a dedicated keyboard tray and a monitor stand, which adds to the convenience and ergonomics. The keyboard tray frees up desk space and places the keyboard at a comfortable height. The monitor stand also helps to elevate the screen to eye level, reducing neck strain during prolonged use.One of the standout features of this desk is the LED lights. They add a cool, modern vibe that gamers will appreciate. The lights can also provide a soft glow for late-night gaming sessions or work.The storage shelves are a practical addition, providing room for books, gaming consoles, or office supplies. This feature enhances the desk's functionality, keeping everything organized and within easy reach.However, the desk isn't perfect. The assembly process might be a bit daunting, especially for those who aren't handy with tools. The instructions might be somewhat difficult to follow, so setting up could take some time.Another potential drawback is the material quality. While the desk is generally sturdy, the material might not stand up well to scratches or heavy weight. It's advisable to be cautious when moving or placing heavy objects on the desk.In conclusion, the SEDETA White Computer Desk, 63'' Corner Gaming Desk, is an excellent choice for gamers or anyone in need of a spacious, modern workstation. It's not without its minor flaws, but the benefits significantly outweigh the drawbacks. This product earns a well-deserved four out of five stars for its overall performance and value.",

Instructions were easy to follow along, everything was labeled, and it came with everything you need to build it including the tools and screws. I was able to build it by myself but it did take a couple of hours. I highly recommend you look at the dimensions to see if it suits you, and also do not over tighten the screws as it could crack the wood (I had no issues with the wood cracking thought). I\u2019m pretty satisfied with the desk overall.",

They first offered me $25 refund and said I could call a carpenter to fix it. Then they offered me $50 refund. Then they said we will refund you half or you can return it for a full refund. I said yes took it apart and packaged up and waited for their reply. Completed ghosted me for a week. Then they said they can\u2019t provide a label because I bought it in July.
