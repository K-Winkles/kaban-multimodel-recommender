                "reviewText": "I got this outdoor tv because it's OS was WebOS from LG. Now I see it not the full version of WebOS. I can connect my tv to LG ThinQ but when I try to connect the tv to Google Home I can't. This is very disappointing because I do a lot of automation at my home. This puts a damper on my plans for my outdoor space.FYI, remote is not waterproof. To protect the remote you must use the waterproof bag but its hard to use the remote in the bag.",
