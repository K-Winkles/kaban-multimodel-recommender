                "reviewText": "Wanted to splurge and buy my first OLED TV. Definitely not disappointed. This thing displays colors that I never thought a TV could display. Especially in HDR, the TV displays more colors with different amounts of depth, tone, vibrance then I have ever seen on any display. Turning on an HDR film for the first time I was blown away by the way colors are displayed, and only OLED with self emissive pixels can do this. It's not so much about having the perfect blacks, which is another benefit of OLED, the technology allows for true HDR and color handling like none other. And I am an average consumer, not a videophile. But the difference from this and a QLED TV was noticeable. I do wish the price was lower, but it comes with the territory. The TV does require quite a bit of picture tuning out of the box, as it comes in a video mode which exaggerates colors far too much. Another thing I noticed out of the box was motion post processing, which made 30HZ content appear like it was 120HZ by filling in the blank frames. This was great but disorienting out of the box because at it's maximum level, it becomes noticeable how this technology cannot keep up with fast motion and makes the video look like it is \"stuttering\" during fast motion scenes. I researched the perfect level for this setting and best color settings on RTINGS and by watching youtube videos, and have the TV dialed in perfectly. The UI is quick and responsive for now, and the TV does a good job of applying the screensaver when motion is not detected for a few minutes to reduce burn in. I've only had it for 3 months, but have experienced no burn in, even when playing games with static GUI. The solar remote is nice and has not needed to be manually charged at all yet. The TV is 10/10 amazing for gaming which is my primary use. you will not get a better picture with any other technology. The screen brightness is not bad. In extremely bright rooms with sun pouring in, you do lose out on some details as the picture does not get quite bright enough to preserve the details. I do run this TV on max brightness at all times. But it is not bad by any means. The screen is glossy to preserve colors, but has an anti-reflective tint that does a very good job at controlling reflections, even from lamps. I do recommend turning off the \"Hey Bixby\" voice wake up for the voice remote, as the tv has set it off a few too many times when no one said \"Hey Bixby.\" Just use the button. The sound is also quite a bit punchier with more bass than your average TV speakers and I am impressed, albeit it is not a home theater. However the advertised \"object tracking sound\" to me is not noticeable. The sound seems to be coming all from the same place with the setting turned on. Is it double the TV then a QLED you can get for half the price? Probably not. However it is noticeably better and provides the best viewing experience you can get, and I do not regret it. I hope the TV lasts for years to come and stays burn-in free!",

                "reviewText": "The Samsung S90C in a seriously ultra-thin design that immediately catches the eye. Pretty much everyone who has come over and cant believe how thin it is, and how beautiful the image is.Picture Quality: Amazing, it handles day time viewing like a champ, I have a sunny living room and I have no issues seeing the image.Design: Again, how thin this thing is. Remote is amazing and simple.Smart Features: I use a firestick, BUT there is a built in Samsung TV service thats free that has a surprising amount of channels and actual content. There is local TV and random big network channels avaible to watch. You can also use your smart phone as a remote if you download the Samsung app, which is super super useful. Especially if you cant find your remote.Connectivity: Multiple HDMI and USB ports and also Digital Audio in which I couldn't get confirmation it had one until I purchased the TV.Audio: Can't speak to it, using a surround sound system.Motion Handling: Handles it well, I am oldschool and I actually turn off all the motion blending.Potential Considerations:Price: Expensive, but for the currently price, and after months of research, I don't think today you can can anything that is more B for the Buck then this TVBrightness in Well-Lit Rooms: In dark rooms amazing, but if you are getting direct sunlight it can get a bit washed out, but its in a sunny room currently and I don't have much of a issue.Gaming Performance: Haven't done any gaming on TV.Remote: The remote is powered by a solar panel in the back of the remote. You can also charge it by USB. So far i've had no connectivity issues with the remote, or power issues.Conclusion:The Samsung S90C is a solid OLED TV at a solid price. After months of research and youtube views I landed on this model, and so far I am still thrilled (4months later) with my purchase!",
