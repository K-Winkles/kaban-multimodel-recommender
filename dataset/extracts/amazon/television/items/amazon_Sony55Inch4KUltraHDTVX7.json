The sound is great too, we barely have to turn it up to hear it just fine, and I'm a bit hard of hearing. We play a lot of video games and the image and play is wonderful with the new consoles, maybe too good cause it can be hard to adjust to after the old TV we had. The setup is nice for the apps that come on the TV. It's easy to navigate, and we have no trouble with them unlike our Samsung that was missing apps or simply didn't want to play some of them. No lag at all. Just a great TV",

No lag. Way more buttons to get where you want quickly. Did I say no lag?Throw away your Sony remote that came with this TV. It'll kill you!And you don't need to point it at the TV. It's IR but a cleverly placed LED lets you look straight at the remote and still get the button's press received by the TV. Did I mention no lag?The IR LED is so power-full that the signal bounces off ceilings and walls.This remote makes a cheap Sony TV very acceptable./End RevisionI've owned Sony TVs all my life (76yrs).They are more expensive but worth it.This is the first cheap Sony I've owned.And cheap it is (Stupid of me as this is like bottom of their line).Setup was excruciating. F\u00cfinding the AC plugin was well not easy.Very poor instructions.It says much when you need to read the instructions (no manual)one page that folds out and out and... And I needed a magnifyingglass to read it. I think the AC port was shown but the quality ofthe diagram/print was poor.Google TV. A joke. No instructions.I wanted to add Sling to my Home page.No way I could figure it out.Google TV was supposed to limit the amount of steps/scrolling tosee/find what you want.Not so. A mess. Not intuitive. Irritating lag.Picture quality good. Adjusting screen parameters just fairly easy.I believe I've found 3 to 4 places where settings are made. Really?Changing inputs is not clear. As I write this I do not know how to do this.I did it once but don't remember how I got there.I'll stumbled accross it again I suppose. Instructions please!All in all very disappointed in Sony even for a cheap set.If I ever buy another cheap TV it won't be a Sony.Sony: How hard would it be to have navigation on a cheap set the same as yourmore expensive ones?Cheap Sony TVs have bad navigation.Spend another $1K with Sony to get a slick interface.Thanks... KenUpdate 11/03/2023: 2 stars -- 1 starBluetooth paired devices volume control via remote gets stuck on one volume.Only way to recover is to reset the TV.All settings lost.Google TV interface freezes ~twice a day.Sling app crashes regularly.Thanks...

                "reviewText": "Let me preface my comments by saying that I am a devoted Sony customer and have several Sony home theater and audio components in my home.I purchased this 43 inch Sony Bravia TV so my son could watch it occasionally instead of commandeering my living room 65 inch Sony when I'm trying to watch something like a live sporting event. For the purposes of providing a decent picture, the Sony 43 inch is adequate but doesn't come close to the stunning picture quality of the older Sony X950H in the living room, which unlike the 43 inch Bravia supports Dolby Vision.The processor on the 43 inch Bravia also seems to lag significantly when using the Google interface sometimes taking up to a minute or more to actually appear on screen. Luckily, I have an Apple TV 4k connected to the TV, so I don't have to deal with the frustrating lag of Google interface on the Bravia. It should be noted that the older 65 inch Bravia doesn't have this lag problem and both TVs are getting more than adequate network throughput speed from my EERO mesh routers.Finally, unlike other manufacturers, Sony never divulges the firmware update version that has (if it ever is) downloaded to the TV and never indicates whether any firmware (software) has been installed on a specific date. As a result the user simply has no idea if Sony is ever offering a firmware update to the TV or not...and sadly must assume that Sony never really updates the TV's firmware after the set has been purchased. For a company that prides itself on its engineering prowess and making impressive televisions, especially for picture quality, this is a glaring omission and a signal to its customers that they just don't need to know these petty details. One must also assume that the Sony engineers will never provide a firmware update to the 43 inch X77L to support Dolby Vision or any other enhancements or improvements (lag fixing the lag issue on the Google interface...which should concern the folks at Google).So, if you want a pleasant viewing experience, connect an Apple TV 4k to the Sony X77L and also connect some external speakers (I've connected a pair of NOTABRICK Bluetooth speakers that are recognized by the Apple TV 4k set top box) and provide much better sound than what the 43 Bravia can do on its own. Just don't expect a phenomenal picture or Dolby Vision support or any firmware updates from the Sony team. Do better, Sony.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 43\u201d for my bedroom and it\u2019s the perfect size. I also bought a sound bar and subwoofer because the speakers in the TV are \u201c lacking \u201c in the sound quality. The Bravia has to many options to list, but I had everything hooked up and ready to go in about 15 minutes. The most time consuming part of setting up a new TV, is the settings themselves, and Sony has put a lot of different settings in this TV. I was actually surprised by this because a lot of the options and settings are usually only found on higher end TV\u2019s. I\u2019ve had no problems so far, but I have heard from other buyers that the Bluetooth can get flakey or in simple terms, it loses the connection but reconnects after a few seconds. I would find that very annoying. If it happens with mine, it will be returned or hopefully Sony has a patch that can be downloaded to the TV. All in all, this is a great TV from a trusted brand. I hope it lasts for a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 65 inch version of the Sony X77L to replace my still working 12 year old Sony 46inch LCD on a black Friday deal. Reading other reviews, I was concerned the TV would arrive damaged due to delivery, but I was lucky, the TV arrived in 2 days, well packaged, and in absolutely perfect condition, the delivery driver even helped me move it into the house! Although this is Sony's \"entry level\" 4K TV, it is a huge upgrade over our old TV. I have no complaints about the picture quality, if you want to pay much more, Sony does have higher end TVs that probably produce blacker blacks, and maybe marginally smoother picture, but for the price, you cannot beat this tv! I am not using the smart features as I have my Apple TV 4K box connected via HDMI arc, and it works great. No need to use the Native Sony Google TV system if you love your Apple TV box!",
