The picture is bright and clear but you definitely need to hook up external speakers or the outdoor speaker bar that's designed specifically for this television. You will also need a strong outdoor television wall mount. This unit is very heavy and requires a quality unit to hold it up safely and securely.Great unit for the price! You won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this TV is very good. After one year of using an indoor TV on a covered patio (Texas) until the TV stopped working, I concluded that an outdoor TV was needed. The rear of this TV is fully enclosed and has a hinged, sealed door to access connections. It is quite heavy. Picture quality is very good. My only complaint is that the sound quality is horrible. And I\u2019m not an audiophile. I would strongly recommend external speakers.",

                "reviewText": "Walt's TV has the worst customer service. I received a TV I ordered and cut the tape on the top of the box and realized the TV I had ordered was not going to work. I never took it out of the box. I returned the TV and they said it was damaged when it came back, which it was NOT. But since I broke the seal of the box they are saying it is. Absolutely ridiculous. They are saying that they don't have to give me all of my money back for this $900 TV. They will only refund $500 something. I cannot believe this!!!! I am in dispute with Amazon about not getting a refund credited at all. Amazon should evaluate doing business with Walt's TV. This is unacceptable as I did NOTHING wrong and the TV was never removed from the box. Do not buy anything that Amazon has from Walt's TV if this is how they treat their customers.",
