I had to get them one because they had a 250 lb Toshiba Box TV that was way older than me (I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s lol) and were in need of an upgrade. I got them this and I\u2019m beyond excited. Does everything I need it to. Only thing I wish is that there were larger screen options. The 43\u201d does the job but if I would have been able to spend $50 extra for a 55\u201d, I would have jumped on it. Other than that, it\u2019s great! I see other reviews commenting on sound quality, but I have to say, for this price point on a decent sized TV, you cannot complain! It\u2019s truly worth the money if you\u2019re looking for a DUMB TV!",

                "reviewText": "..I am so glad that I chose this product. The picture quality is really nice and the sound is what you'd expect from rear-firing speakers: average. The product was packaged really well. The assembly was simple -- Sceptre even included a screwdriver for the stand. There are NO internet features on this product. No Wi-Fi, no ethernet jack, etc. for those of you who want/need that. I was really, really pleased with myself when I saw the results upon power-on. Fantastic value. I ordered two other Sceptre TVs already!!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this on Cyber Monday, primarily for use as a PC monitor.This has an internal calendar and clock. The clock defaults to 2016, probably when the model was introduced, which would explain why so cheap.Picture was saturated and a tad on the green side for my eyes, but I was able to tone it down and balance it out enough that things don't look like a mushroom trip. Part of that was done through the Windows Video Calibration settings. I can see light areas when the picture is supposed to be a black screen. That can only be improved with a better backlight diffuser.Audio is, well, it's adequate if you're patient enough to fiddle with the audio settings, but even then it sounds like a cheap boom-box. Only redeeming quality in this department is that It has audio outs if you have an external amp and speakers of better quality. I might also take the back off and hook directly to external speakers.If I didn't need a new monitor post haste, I would definitely have waited until I could afford better, but for the price this will do for a year or so.",
