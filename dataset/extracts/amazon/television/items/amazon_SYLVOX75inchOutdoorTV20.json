(I still recommend a cover when not using)The picture is great in sun or shade. This TV has all the apps you want with a good remote and easy interface.Audio with out soundbar was decent consider outdoor TV and environment (audio will always be better inside due to physics).I am now the envy of my HOA and friends all want to come over for the games! Love this TV!Okay, now, non-TV related things to add (non factor to 5 star):- I originally bought the https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B63F7Y95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1- It arrived broke and had to work through Sylvox through the issues. They were responsive, just very annoying to receive a broken TV.- From what I could make of the first one, I am almost happy it arrived broke now, because spending the money for the Pool Pro was WAY WORTH it (better quality/apps/specs). Spend the extra money and get Pool Pro.- I also have their sound bar for the TV and have mixed reviews.",

There are several that are missing so we had to add a Roku to get Amazon, YouTubeTV, Pluto, etc... and the worst part is the Roku cannot control the volume or power since the TV has a unknown IR code.There are no updates to correct this as of yet.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 43\" full sun version. It will be installed outside soon. I tested it inside and the display seems plenty bright enough, and the picture quality is on par with typical 4K TVs. This will be used as a digital display, located on the exterior of a marina office. It will bear the brunt of full sun, rain, and salt mist coming off the water. So, be on the lookout for my follow-up review in a few months! If this thing can hold up to this environment, I think we have a winner! LOL. Stay tuned...My only gripe for now is, removing the back panel is a pain. It's 13 tiny screws. If you drop them, they are gone forever. Why didn't they use thumb-screws instead? Cost, I'm sure.",

At night the picture quality is outstanding.I had an issue with the TV malfunctioning. It was still under warrantee and Sylvox immediately addressed the issue and sent me a replacement 2023 model.They also arranged for the return of the TV to their factory in Canada.I want to specifically thank Maggie at Sylvox for making the entire process stress free and for her excellent customer service.I would recommend Sylvox products for anyone that is looking for a quality outdoor TV reasonably priced and backed by really great customer service and support of their product.Cheers Maggie and thank you Sylvox for standing by the quality of your TV.Nick Mascia/ New York City",

                "reviewText": "I researched up and down. This tv fit the bill and arrived in excellent condition. I chose the pool series as opposed to the pool pro knowing I was going to use my fire stick that spent time in jail and then broke out. It is heavy - 73 lbs, so get an appropriate heavy duty wall mount. I will also say that I anticipated controlling the tv with my firestick remote and initially found that Sylvox and the parent manufacturer aren\u2019t on the supported firestick list. I searched and searched, and found that a Roku remote will support it if Polaroid or RCA is chosen, so I gave it a shot. Lo and behold, Polaroid worked! My firestick remote now controls my Sylvox TV! Also, if your concerned about visibility in full sun, I was very very pleased with the picture with the sun shining directly on it, and the only consequence of the sun was the viewing angle was minimally affected. Nice TV!!!!",

New tv has been ordered and will be shipped freight to avoid damage. Maggie has been in touch multiple times a day.Of note: this is the second tv purchased, though I failed to review the first. The fact that we continue to order them says it all - it\u2019s a great product And very good sound. It is very heavy but as long as you hang properly, not an issue.We received this TV today. Box was damaged and upon unboxing, noted TV is broken. Our return was supposed to come with what they say is a prepaid label but it was only an address and said that we had to pay shipping. This tv is HEAVY and it cost us over $323 to ship back! That's crazy. I was going to re-order the same item but how can I when it is a common issue to have them break in shipment? I would love to get this resolved if someone can reach out to me.",
