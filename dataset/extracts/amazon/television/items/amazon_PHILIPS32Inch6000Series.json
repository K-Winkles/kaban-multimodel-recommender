It scales perfectly, has no delay between input and display, and works great for NES, SNES, Genesis & PS1 game systems. (It doesn't emulate scan lines, so Duck Hunt doesn't work. Not exactly a deal breaker). It has black borders on both sides, and doesn't force wide screen by stretching the picture with a 4:3 AV input. The built-in Roku is an added bonus. The picture quality is outstanding for a 720p, especially at this price point.It isn't a 1080p or 4k display, but that's not why I bought it.",
