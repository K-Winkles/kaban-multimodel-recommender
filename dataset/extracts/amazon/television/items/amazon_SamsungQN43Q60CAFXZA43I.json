I'm very happy with the excellent picture quality and the streaming capabilities. The only thing I dislike about the TV so far is the sound. I have to turn the volume up fairly high in order to get the sound where I like it. I would recommend adding a sound bar, which I plan to do in the future, for the better sound quality.",

Between the packaging and the shipping it cost my mother $200 to return a defective TV. Horrible!! Do not order a TV from Walt\u2019s!!!!!!!",

I decided to replace it with the more expensive Samsung TV and am so glad that we did. The color was so much brilliant and richer, the outside light didn't alter the visibility at all. The apps function well and I found it better use Samsung's remote than the Amazon's stick which seems degraded the color.",
