                "reviewText": "I only give it 4 stars because it's a basic smart TV (aka, not OLED, or some other high end TV). Size upgrade from a 24\" to the 32\" for the bedroom. The 24\" was a Samsung with Roku device attached. which I liked. I also have a 55\" TCL Roku TV. Very familiar with Roku and I like the interface. With Roku built into the TV, and if you have an antenna, the option to select antenna is built into the choices of on screen inputs. Makes it easy.This particular TV is fine. Nothing special over and above the other TV's I have. It's only 720P, but fine for a bedroom, etc. Picture is very good, and sound is fine (but obviously can be much better with a sound bar). One review mentioned that the plastic used to protect the bezel during shipping is hard to get off. They weren't wrong. Not that hard, but a bit of a pain. Why they don't make it easier to remove the plastic is beyond me. Getting nit picky with negatives, because it's not that big a deal, and there's really nothing else to complain about. Overall, a good quality TV at a good price. Recommended...",

The leg screws are in with the remote. You must lay the T.V face down to put legs on as recommended in instructions. (Right side leg was still loose even after fully tightened the screws) it was EASY to SET UP, APPS were PRE-LOADED that you get to pick from list. Just log into your favorite app and go. The T.V looks Good, are COLORS VIVID. I tested the Gaming console at1080p It Runs and looks terrific. (Yes I had to for our gamers, or what kind of a reviewer would I be hello!) SETTINGS are SIMPLE, SOUND is wonderful, MULTIPLE HD connections X3, which are fantastic if you have a few devices. So all and all I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND this ROKU T.V.",
