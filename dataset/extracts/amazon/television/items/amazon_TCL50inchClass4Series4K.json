                "reviewText": "I've been using TCL flatscreens for about 6 years now. This is my second one. My first one was a Roku OS (2016 model, I think) and finally started getting really slow this year (processor going bad). This is my first Android TCL TV and I can't stress enough about how much of a bargain this TV is.The picture quality won't rival a $1k+ TV, but it still looks great for everyday use. I just watched Dune in 4k on it, and the picture quality is really outstanding for a $300 tv. Honestly, the difference between this and a TV 3x the price is extremely minimal and not worth the extra money, but that's my opinion.I saw a lot of complaints about the audio, and yes, the audio out of the box is terrible. This is because the default setting is on \"Dynamic\", which sounds awful. I highly suggest going into the settings and switching it to \"Standard\" or \"Movie\" mode for audio and it will sound much better. There are also more advanced settings to tweak it to your liking. I have a pretty big living room and I haven't had any audio issues since I tinkered with the audio settings.I also saw a lot of complaints about Google spyware, Data collection, or however you want to word it. You can opt out of everything on the initial setup of the TV, as well as later in the settings menu. Don't share any diagnostics or opt into any personalized programming or anything like that and you should be fine.The Android TV interface is a bit buggy right now. There's some delay in choosing menus and selecting apps and things like that, but I've not really had many issues. I haven't had any apps crash or anything experience breaking yet. I expect it to get much smoother as more updates roll out. If you're an android user, it's really nice to sync everything with your phone and google account.Overall, I highly recommend this TV. TCL TV's, in my experience, are workhorse TV's that produce very high quality for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the 43S434 model in my bedroom for about a month now and now that I've figured out a few things I really enjoy this TV for the basics.When using the TV for streaming the video mode should be set to 'Movie' or else you will have the dreaded soap opera effect. I tried this on every video setting and played with the other advanced settings, but setting it to 'Movie' was the only way to avoid this.When using the HDMI inputs with my Switch, the video mode 'Game' is available and drastically improves the colors, resolution, and input lag. I'm assuming this would be the same for other game consoles.There are some downsides, but they're not terribly noticeable. First being the picture saturation with the image looking a bit washed out unless you're more or less directly in line with the TV. The other would be that there are a number of video modes and advanced settings to mess with, but overall they are mostly unnecessary. As I shared above, Game Mode works great for game consoles , and for everything else Movie Mode is the only video preset you can use that doesn't cause the soap opera effect. With the advanced picture settings I would recommend you turn them all off, or at least lower them and see if they improve your experience.Overall I'm very pleased with this TV for my bedroom. I have it paired with a TCL soundbar (the TV audio isn't that bad either) and can use the TVs advanced audio settings to sync up the audio and video very well. There is a sleep timer that I love to use at night, and the brightness and color are great even in a bright room.",

                "reviewText": "The sound on this TV is astounding. Our other way more expensive TV can't even hold a candle to it. Right off the bat it's a win. The picture quality for video games, my primary use, is spectacular but ONLY if you go into the menu and choose Game Mode. If you do not do this, it is laggy almost to the point of unusability. It's a shame an auto-detection wasn't built in, or the ability to assign a particular input source that attribute.The picture quality while playing a blu-ray DVD of a PS4 was a bit disappointing. It was fuzzy-ish across a few movies that I trotted out to test it. I don't have any 4k source material to actually test that on, but I had thought if it had that level of resolution then naturally a blu-ray would look its best. Not the case.The remote is pretty much the same that you would get with a Roku or Fire TV stick. It's small and easy to lose, the layout is really just not that great as far as determining the function in the dark by shape/depth/markings of the buttons. For this price there is of course no backlighting option but that wasn't expected. For some reason TV manufacturers are still putting dedicated-service use buttons on their remotes. As if a button is going to get me to subscribe to a service that I have no interest in. Please TV people - ditch these dumb buttons.The Google voice command feature is pretty slick and generally hears everything you say and returns results quickly. Feels like it's a step above Alexa in speed and comprehension. For $300, this TCL TV is nothing short of a miracle, even with these small issues. If you need a second TV for the rec room or for gaming - I couldn't recommend it more. Again I have not actually tested the 4k display aspect. So maybe check out other reviews for that.",

At first, I thought it was our mobile digital antenna but, after talking to people who actually know. I found out the factory TV looked nice, but was absolute junk. The tuner and electronics in this TV are far above what we had and there is a 1000% improvement in reception, picture stability and quality. My only regret is that I think I could have went one size bigger, but that one is on me not the TV :-)",
