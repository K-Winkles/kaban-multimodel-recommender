                "reviewText": "First mistake, it was refurbished. The box was huge and torn and difficult to maneuver by myself. Once I finally got the TV out of the broken box and unwrapped there would absolutely have been no way I could have repacked it by myself to return it. The exterior is in perfect condition but whoever originally purchased this TV stripped the screw holes for the legs so it's only resting its legs but not screwed in tight. I had the entire set up and unwrapped before I discovered the stripped screws. It looked like the same screws had been re-bagged and tapped shut. The digital picture is only fair and not very sharp. The Sony flat screen I gave away because it was 15 years old had a far better picture. BUT... in all fairness this Vizio WAS refurbished... and I could have returned it... it was just too much to handle alone. But the worst part about this TV is that when you record a show and play it back the commercials re-play at such a high decibel you can literally hear them blaring from the unit next door no matter how low the volume is set. I hate this TV. Can't wait to replace it. And it wasn't even good value for a refurbished TV. I was just tired from moving and wanted a TV quickly. Never again will buy a Vizio OR any refurbished TV.",
