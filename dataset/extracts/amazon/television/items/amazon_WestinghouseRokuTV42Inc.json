The TV did most everything automatically (except for typing in the user and password IDs). I was able to quickly login to my all of my streaming apps and had everything going in about 20 to 25 minutes. Waiting for the Roku TV software updates took most of the time. I couldn't be happier with the TV performance and with the ease and speed of setting everything up.",

The only thing I have an issue with is that this item is a large electronic and there were no fragile stickers or labels on the box. The was a huge gash in the package that went all the way through to the product. I had to open it even though this is a Christmas gift just to make sure it was not broken and still worked. Good news is that the gash was on the back of the TV and didn't harm the TV. The package was also just tossed onto my lawn.",
