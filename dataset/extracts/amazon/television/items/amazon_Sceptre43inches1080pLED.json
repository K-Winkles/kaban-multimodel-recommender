I wouldn't use this TV as my main viewing platform, but for the price, and for a bedroom, I highly recommend it.Con's: Viewing past a 45 deg angle the video seems to be SLIGHTLY washed out. Viewing directly, the video is sharp. Mine is mounted on a mount/swivel, so that's not a problem. I always run in vivid mode, not in standard mode.The audio is on the tinny side. Even adjusting the base, doesn't help much. It does not have an arc/hdmi port, nor does it have an optical out port. Again, you have to consider the price. I have a pair of Edifier R1280T Powered (42w) Bookshelf Speakers. There are RCA inputs on the back of the TV. I would recommend external speakers but you may find the TV audio ok for you. It's not gross, just a personal choice.The remote doesn't have a backlit. Again, consider the price. The TV is connected to a cable wireless box, so I use the cable remote that has a backlit.Final overview: For the price, I could not find another TV that performed as well. I would definitely buy this TV again.",

                "reviewText": "The TV arrived a day early. I was not at home. Lucky the UPS driver left it at my back covered porch, it was raining! As soon as I got home in the evening I brought it inside. It was late so I didn't open it until today. A good neighbor friend came over and she & I took it out of the box and screwed the legs on. Sceptre even provided a little screw driver! I plugged my Roku Streaming Stick Plus into the HDMI-1 spot with the SUB port hook up for wireless. Then I hooked up my Blue Ray into the HDMI-3 spot, then I hooked up my VCR/DVD combo into the red, white & yellow ports. Then we lifted this very light weight TV onto my cabinet and plugged her in. Using the TV remote I pressed power. NOTHING happened. After realizing maybe it was the batteries they sent were too old, I switched to fresh Energizer batteries and it worked! My Roku came on the screen right away. I scrolled down to settings and clicked onto Roku remote to run my TV and it was all set up in seconds! I played something on Netflix....GREAT! Then Amazon Prime....Great! Then I turned to YouTube.....GREAT! The picture quality on this set is really GOOD and the sound is fantastic! This Sceptre 43\"TV is replacing a 39\" LG HD LED TV that died on me last week after having it for only 4 years and 2 months! The LG was twice the price as this one, and side by side right now I have to say I can't see much difference in picture quality. The LG sounded very surround sound though, but this TV has great volume to me, even my friend thought it was way too loud. I see no need for any added speakers or a sound bar at all. I'm glad I got this for the sale price but at under $250 for a TV of this size and quality it's worth it. I cut the cord 4 years ago and now only stream and I love it!! This was the easiest TV ever to set up! My friend & I are both senior citizens and this was a snap! I love Amazon.com I ordered this Friday, 9-28-18 and got it delivered to my back door on Tuesday, 10-2-18. Amazon Prime is the way to go baby! Now I'm back to streaming movies, movies, movies! LOVE IT!!",

I have had no issues with display, everything is displayed properly up to 1920x1080 with no pixel/ratio problems. Picture is crisp and clear. The sound however is absolute trash. You can make it a little better by adjusting the sound settings, but even a cheap soundbar would be an improvement. I also don't like the two stands on either end and would have much preferred a central stand as having the stands on the sides limits where you can place the TV, but this is a minor complaint as I have removed them and put the TV on a mount anyway. TV is lightweight making mounting and just handling in general easier. It doesn't have all the modern features of a pricier TV, but it fulfills my needs and I'm happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "A definite upgrade from my previous gaming tv, a unit from '05 or so and showing it's age. I use headphones for all sound output to avoid bothering my family (though they refuse to return the favor) so can't really speak for sound quality. It was surprisingly hard to find a tv WITHOUT all the built in smart thisandthats, but I'm not gonna sit through updating my tv before I have to sit through updating my games. For someone who doesn't need a super ultra-def curved million inch voice activated whatever, this unit gets the world saved, bosses beat, and shows/movies binged at a reasonable price. Overscan was easy to turn off in the menu as well, so I don't have to deal with half my Skyrim menus being cut off. Bless you Sceptre.",

I contacted the sellers made a few suggestions and after I tried them for a few days and called back about a replacement since it was new, their response? Oh, \"I'm sorry sir, you are now 2 days past your available 30 day return window\" They refused to help me anymore except to say I could search for a tv repair shop that may accept my warranty. Astalavista. I know many people like me on occasion read these reviews and ignore them. I did after reading the sound was bad but please don't waste your money. You will not be happy with this tv!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: The TV has now died completely. It has gone from terrible to worse. No power at all. I'm sure the warranty process will be just as bad as this piece of crap TV!Update: Looks like amazon has dumped on me also. I requested their help as the seller has been totally non-helpful and amazon has left me hanging. This is really out of character for amazon and I am very disappointed!",
