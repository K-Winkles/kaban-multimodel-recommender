Couple months ago I bought this tv because I wanted a smart tv that would be able to access my Apple channel subscriptions. It works like a dream. I canceled my satellite service and I just use this tv. It saved me enough money that it paid for itself. Such a deal. It was seriously was like getting a free tv after 2 months. So if you don\u2019t need a free high quality tv then this isn\u2019t your thing. But if you\u2019d like to change the way you get tv by all means this is the tv for you. Vizio also has watchfree channels that come as a part of the tv. It also has the ability to sync up your smartphone to it and use your phone for a remote. Which is snazzy but I didn\u2019t see the point unless the actual remote goes missing.",

                "reviewText": "This TV is NOT a TV ... It's a streaming device. You cannot expect to turn on this TV, and have it restart on the same channel as when you turned it off. If you have an antenna, and you're watching channel 4, for example, and you turn your TV off and go to bed, when you wake up the next day and turn your TV on, it will not go to the station you left it on when you turned it off. Instead, it will default to the streaming menu as if you want to pick a movie. If you just want to turn your TV on, where you left it last, you CANNOT do that. I have spoken to tech support at Vizio, and they have verified it CANNOT be done. There is a button for what they call, FREE TV+, but that will only take you to a menu of RECENT items. If you're a person who actually likes to watch antenna TV, or switch between games on Sunday, this TV is not for you. By default when you turn it on, it goes to the MOVIE menu. If you want to watch Free TV, You have to hold down the OKAY button, to bring up a display, and then scroll all the way to the bottom of that display and choose ANTENNA. It's like 15 clicks just to get to the stupid ANTENNA TV. There is no way to make it the default. Also, I don't know who designed the interface for this, but it's garbage. The menus do not wrap around. If you get to the bottom of one menu, you would expect if you kept pressing down then it would just wrap around back to the top of the menu ... It doesn't. If you want to get back to the top of that menu, you have to arrow up ALL THE WAY through the menu, instead of it, just wrapping around, back to the top of the menu. If you expect to just turn on your TV, and expect to just get TV, and all of your stations, this piece of garbage is not going to allow that to happen. You can literally never turn on your TV and get normal TV. The best you can do is turn on the TV and get to the RECENT menu, and that will only give you the last three channels you were on. I downloaded the app for my phone, and it's just as bad. Don't waste your time with the app. Again, this is not a TV for normal TV viewing. This is all about streaming and advertising. There is a TV in there, but it's buried, and it will not show up on any menu , until you scan the TV for new stations, then it will add an Antenna menu . However, right out of the box there is no option to watch TV as the default. I'm still trying to figure out how somebody could design a menu so badly. Oh, also if you like to flip between TV stations back and forth, forget it. If you want to flip back and forth between stations, it's not going to happen. I'm seriously thinking about returning this piece of garbage simply because the menu is designed so poorly. IS IT REALLY SO MUCH TO ASK , THAT IF I TURN A TV OFF, WHEN I TURN IT BACK ON IT'S ON THE SAME STATION ? IS THAT REALLY TOO MUCH TO ASK , THAT MY TV STARTS UP WHERE I LET LEFT IT WHEN I TURNED IT OFF? Every TV in the history of mankind, would normally turn on at the same place. You left it when you turned it off . Not this one !!! If you are looking for a TV ... This is definitely NOT the answer. Again, this is verified information provided to me by Vizio technical support. Looks like this one's going back in the box. Shameful. Over something so simple as turning a TV on and off, that doesn't exist anymore. Wow!",

The replacement just arrived today and I couldn\u2019t possibly be more impressed with the video quality and the range of sound. The colors are so vibrant and the HD is amazing. My phone camera isn\u2019t doing the picture quality justice, I promise. I honestly couldn\u2019t be happier with my purchase or the customer service I received from Amazon. Not to mention how great the price is. 10/10 would recommend.",
