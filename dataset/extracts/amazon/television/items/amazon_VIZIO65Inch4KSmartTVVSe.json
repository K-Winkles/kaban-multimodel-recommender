                "reviewText": "I thought I was getting a good value TV but instead what I got was garbage with horrible customer service. The audio gets out of sync regularly, the sound just drops randomly, and it will often just completely stop responding to the remote and go black. We have to unplug it to reset it daily now. I did reach out to Vizio today for support and they told me there is a problem they are aware of with their Firmware and they are working on the issue with no timeline in sight. Thanks, that helps me out tremendously. Save your money and find another brand!!",
