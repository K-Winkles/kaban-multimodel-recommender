Weird but no matter, I ripped the box as I normally would which the tv did not appreciate. When I plugged it in it tripped my breaker, thing must suck a lot of electricity so I had to invest in a new GFI. Lastly the picture is so real that the images were all around me or maybe it\u2019s the drugs not sure 10 out of 10 would buy again but I\u2019m living in the back of a warehouse using their outlets for power. Tv is worth far more then $25K If anyone would like to donate so that I can stop living in the back of this warehouse my numb-",
