                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Even Vudu...",
                "reviewText": "My previous TV, a flat-screen gifted to me in 2011, already ready to go, died last week. All of my adult life I have made do with hand-me-down or used TVs/monitors.My dead TV was set up in my office so I could watch TV while working on the computer. I fed the TV with a laptop, via HDMI. I had previously poured a giant glass of ice-water on the laptop so the screen doesn't work very well, which made it perfect for feeding the TV.I have large VOD libraries on both Prime Video and Vudu, so when looking at the Smart TV options, access to Vudu is important to me. So I originally decided against this TV because it's an Amazon Fire TV, and my Fire Tablet, (that I use to watch TV/movies in bed), doesn't allow me to put Vudu on it.But when looking at all of the options, this one was the right size, and it does have HDMI inputs, so I could still feed it with my broken laptop, so it was the obvious choice, with the great sale price.I searched the apps and found that Vudu was an option. I also downloaded Peacock, Paramount+, Movies Anywhere, Tubi, Plex, Crackle, MSNBC, The CW, ABC, NBC, CBS, and YouTube. Signing into to each of them on my computer and using codes worked really well. So the only thing I had to actually type my password into using the remote was my Wifi. It all works great, and switching to the HDMI input is easy, if I ever want or need to do that. Like if I ever want to watch something I only have on DVD or Blu Ray.I will add Disney+, Hulu and Netflix when the WGA writer's strike is over and I resubscribe to them.I don't know if my previous TV was HD, but when I've visited my parents when they've played Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and other things in HD on their HD TV and it has all looked gross. The Battle of Helms Deep was a bunch of amorphous clay blobs, and the Death Star was a bunch of dudes in bad costumes hanging out. I don't know if that was the motion smoothing thing that Tom Cruise was mad about a few years back, Either way, I've seen none of that gross stuff.I've watch a little of the new Children of the Corn, several episodes of Stargate Atlantis, a little of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and Jurassic Park, and it all looks good. If I look closely I can see what I'm guessing is filmgrain, but the picture is clear.I recently watched an episode of Snoops (1999) that was uploaded to YouTube from probably VHS. There's a brief scene that features Dick Miller. I posted a screenshot to Twitter, but anyone who looked at that pic has to more or less take my word for it that it is indeed Dick Miller. But on this TV I could make guesses about the shade of lipstick worn by Teyla Emmagan, if I knew anything about lipstick.This is all to let you know my level of knowledge so you can judge how my level of happiness would measure up to your level of happiness.My only other observation in the few hours I've had this, is that the TV stands are at the outer edges of the TV. My previous TV had a big center stand, when meant I could perch it fairly near the edge of the table next to my desk, at a 45 degree angle (ish). So with the stands at the edges, I've had to push the TV farther back, and put sturdy things under the stands to give the TV better purchase on the table. Which is to say, you really need enough table under the entire TV to support it.I saw a review that said their TV didn't come with the screws for the stands. Mine did. They were in a separate small bad, the same way the remote batteries were in a separate bag.So far the TV seems absolutely great.",

                "reviewText": "So many good things about this TV. This reliable and great picture TV was the perfect size we were looking for in our office for our kiddo. Our little one is OBSESSED with Songs for Littles and we wanted her to be able to watch when her dad and I had to spend time in the office. Our kiddo has a section to herself that is enclosed for her safety, and I was in the market for a 20-24 inch TV that would sit against a small wall and placed on a mount, especially for her. I bought this SMART TV for the perfect size AND the perfect price. I got this thing during Black Friday and it was about $60 and is so light! Must have! Also, don't pay attention to the uneven mounting... I am having issues finding a sturdy one for this size and little dry wall to go with. I am aware =)",

                "reviewText": "I really have not found out anything about this product that I don't like. Alexa only listens when I push the button and I like that. That way I don't have to be self-conscious about taking her name in vain when she pipes up and asks me what I want when someone inadvertently uses her name in conversations. TV commercials hawking Alexa are the worst. I feel like when an advertisement uses the name Alexa, they instantly draw the attention of millions of Alexa products nation and even world wide. That seems a little scary to me and I'm glad of the way my TV works. :-)Actually, this TV is amazingly simple to open up and run with. It explains everything you need to know and it comes with excellent sound as well as excellent picture. I have a dual monitor set of 31\" monitors and this Fire TV is one of them. After using the Fire TV, I went to the other monitor and duplicated the color schemes and picture sharpness and settings. I liked what was on the Fire TV better than what I was using. In all seriousness, I would highly recommend this TV. I bought it for 89 bucks and I feel like that was a steal based on what I got for the money. I even bought a second one for my daughter who is also enjoying it immensely.",

                "reviewText": "So this is my third purchase of one of these Insignia T.V.s. I purchased a large 40 something inch one for my office board room; a smaller one for my guest bedroom and now, a 32\" one to replace my zapped T.V. in my bedroom. These are very easy to setup and they have great color depth and picture quality. I like how they seamlessly integrate into my Amazon Echo ecosystem with minimal fuss. I also like the simple remote that has built in buttons for common streaming services. These T.V.s also have a lot of extra ports for plugging in sound bars, back lights and other common accessories. The ports are conveniently located on the side so that you don't need to become a contortionist to finagle cords into the plugs. Great value for the money! I highly recommend!",

We use it with cable on one and streaming only on the other.I think it has a lot to offer for the price so overall value is great.The only issue and why i gave it 4 stars is that we ran into a glitch in turning off one of them. the picture went off but the sound did not. we unplugged it and when we plugged it back in, it was fine. we have not had the problem since. that being said, I have experienced that with another smartTV of a different brand in the past. I think it has something to do with downloading new software, but I am not sure.Regardless, I still think it is a great value and is perfect for our needs and i would purchase another should the need arise.",
