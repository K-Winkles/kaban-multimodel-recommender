                "reviewText": "This TV has an incredibly beautiful picture. The colors are rich and lifelike without being overly bright as on some LED TV's, including my last one, an Element which this TV is replacing due to blown HDMI ports after only 3 years. The black on this TVis very, very dark too, like a true black, not a grey. I did find the audio to be tinny and annoying, but with some adjustment of the bass and treble in the audio menu, that was easily remedied and now it sounds pretty good, for TV speakers. One thing to note is that the screw holes on back of the TV for attaching to a wall mount bracket are measured for the smaller square radius of the bracket rather than the large one, and on my bracket, that means using the smaller diameter holes. I didn't still have the rest of the original screws that came with the bracket from when I bought my previous TV and the holes that I needed to use on the bracket are the smaller holes, so my screws were too wide to fit the smaller holes. No big deal, just drilled the holes out on the bracket so the screws would fit. The TV does come with the feet if you want to attach it that way however. For the price, I am quite happy with this purchase and this is my second Westinghouse TV, the previous one being an LCD one from many years ago. That TV was given to a friend and he is STILL using it and it has had no major problems or issues of any kind.",

                "reviewText": "Below is my first review of the TV/DVD player. Here is my final review. It is nothing but a piece of junk that will be another item to add to our already full landfill. It won't work. The DVD player began to have a grinding noise, pause in the middle of movies, eject the DVD in the middle of a movie, to name a few things. I called the Westinghouse tech support 7/24 line. They told me to reset back to factory settings???? And to try this and call back. Of course, it didn't work. I even let the support agent listen to the grinding. I called back the second time on 11/2/2023. She started telling me she would put me on hold and talk to someone. I told her to give me an address to send it back or a refund. She then said it would be an e-mail from the company to give me those instructions. Got the e-mail and they want proof of purchase, picture of TV front view, picture of back view, picture of serial numbers and model number, mail or fax to them. They then will take another 45 days to process my claim. Never again will I buy a TV from Westinghouse.I gave this TV a great review when I first got it but it was more for the service from the company I bought it from but it seemed like a great TV for the price since I only wanted the built-in DVD player for my grandkids. Guess I got in a hurry to give a good review, lesson learned. Almost four months later the DVD player won't work at all. I contacted the seller but unfortunately the three month warranty through them had expired. Now I have to contact Westinghouse. This was a plain TV with no internet abilities etc. but it was not built well at all. The DVD player gets stuck and won't move on with the movie, it skips around when it does. It will not respond to anything when the DVD player is in a hung up mode. It is not the DVDs as I have lots of brand new DVDs and it reacts the same way on all of them so I will now have to contact the company and see what they will do about this issue. I am not happy about this at all. It should have at least lasted a year. I bought it in June and today is Sept 25 so barely three months since I bought i",

                "reviewText": "Extremely, pleasantly surprised!!!! I had always only purchased Sony or RCA televisions. I was quite hesitant to buy this. Set up took moments and the picture is perfect. The sound, I knew immediately would take a bit of time to get used to. I had never before seen a television where the speaker was not facing forward. I adjusted to this, quite quickly and am very much enjoying my new television.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my elderly parents because they're not tech savvy enough to handle a Smart TV. In general, this is exactly what I wanted. Some HDMI ports, some of the old school red/white/yellow inputs for their DVD player, etc. The only drawback was that the top volume wasn't that high and my mom has hearing loss. But I bought them a sound bar that luckily had an optical cord and this TV has an optical input. So it worked out.",
