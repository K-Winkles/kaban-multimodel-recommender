                "reviewText": "I bought the 43-inch model for limited usage on days when it\u2019s too sunny to use my projectors. I owned a 65-inch Vizio OLED model before switching to projectors. This TV doesn\u2019t match the specs of this top-end OLED model, but its color output is pretty spectacular for a $300-on-sale set.Vizio includes lots of functionality with this model, as it works with Amazon, Apple and Google. I can\u2019t recall seeing any TV or projector before offering this complete cross-platform functionality. You can use AirPlay and Chromecast as well as each companies\u2019 digital assistants. I saw one comment saying AirPlay doesn\u2019t work, but it fired right up for me on the first try.A key thing to look for with any TV or projector is color output. I researched this Dolby Vision-capable model on Rtings and saw it performed well, delivering a wide color gamut. This makes such a key difference when watching anything. I gave it the Moana test, and the ocean was a bright and inviting blue, and the land was a vibrant green. On the negative side, I think the picture isn\u2019t the greatest for motion.Out of the box, the picture looked very good. I changed it to vivid and upped the color and tint to 60 each. I noticed some reds looked dark pink when the tint was at 50. Once at 60, things such as YouTube\u2019s red play button looked spot-on.I think it\u2019s cool that Vizio preloads apps, as this can save a lot of time during your setup, but one downside is that some apps folks might rely on such as TBS and TNT aren\u2019t available. This might be because these companies don\u2019t have the will or resources to develop and maintain apps for so many TV platforms, whose number is sizeable (Fire TV, Apple TV, Google and Android TV, Samsung\u2019s Tizen, LG, etc.).One thing Vizio could improve is the use of higher-resolution app and video thumbnail images. If you\u2019re close to the TV, you can see that they\u2019re a bit grainy, but, from a few feet away, you can\u2019t tell as well. This likely is a deliberate choice to help get the most legs out of the TV\u2019s hardware. If so, it\u2019s a smart choice. If you want razor-sharp images, hook up an Apple TV 4K, whose performance is exceptional and crushes even the NVIDIA Shield Pro.Enjoy! \ud83d\udcfa",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Performance with a Few Packaging Quirks",
                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this product from Amazon, and overall, I am impressed with its performance. Let me share my experience and thoughts on this item:Starting with the positives, this product was remarkably easy to assemble and install. The setup process was straightforward, and I had it up and running in no time. The screen arrived well wrapped and protected, ensuring its safety during shipping.The stand of this TV is sturdy, providing reliable support and stability. This feature is particularly important for those who prefer to place their TV on a stand rather than mount it on the wall.One standout aspect is the Vizio software, which I found to be truly awesome. Compared to a Vizio TV I owned from 2015, this model surpasses it in terms of performance and features. The user interface is intuitive, responsive, and offers an enjoyable viewing experience.Furthermore, I appreciate the dynamic port labeling feature. It automatically relabels the HDMI ports based on the device connected, which makes switching inputs a breeze. For example, when turning on the Xbox, the TV automatically relabels the corresponding HDMI input as \"Xbox,\" simplifying the user experience.However, there are a couple of negatives to note. Firstly, the TV is a bit heavy, requiring assistance from another person to move it properly. While this may not be a major concern during everyday use, it's worth considering if you plan on rearranging your setup frequently.Additionally, the original Vizio box that the TV arrived in had an unpleasant odor. Fortunately, this smell did not transfer to the TV itself. However, it was strong enough to warrant moving the box to the garage shortly after unboxing to prevent it from permeating the living room. Although the cause of the odor remains uncertain, it could be attributed to the ink used or the cardboard used in the packaging process.In summary, this product delivers impressive performance and offers a delightful viewing experience. The ease of assembly and installation, along with the sturdy stand, contribute to its overall appeal. The Vizio software surpasses previous models, and the dynamic port labeling adds convenience to switching inputs.However, it is important to note the weight of the TV, which may require assistance during movement. Additionally, the initial odor emanating from the original packaging box was unpleasant, although it did not affect the TV itself.Despite these minor drawbacks, I am satisfied with my purchase and believe this TV provides excellent value for the money. It's a worthwhile choice for those seeking a reliable and feature-rich television experience.",

The Vizio OS is so easy compared to the other cluster of mess out there. I\u2019d honestly say it\u2019s the best alternative if you don\u2019t want the google tv OS or Web OS.It\u2019s very sleek and has four inputs, it\u2019s remote is simple but I like it.I don\u2019t know all the technical mumbo jumbo so this review isn\u2019t for that but I am pleased with my purchase. The tv works as intended. Works better than I expected actually. The free tv was a surprise for me, it showed images of it but I didn\u2019t think it was actually giving me the option to watch free television. The Bluetooth headphone option is wonderful and any changes you need to made to the tv is done with a few clicks with the remote. None of the settings are buried deep and hidden.",
