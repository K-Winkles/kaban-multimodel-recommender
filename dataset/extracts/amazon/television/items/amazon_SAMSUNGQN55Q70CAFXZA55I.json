I kept the remote for the 2015 model and it works perfectly! It even controls the Xfinity cable box. The TV remembers the last source you used and uses that when you turn the TV on. The power saver auto-shut off feature is optional. The only downside is the sound quality. I don't hold it against the TV. It's just a function of flat-screen TVs and the location of the speaker. I bought a Yamaha sound bar (not made in China!) to go with it and now I'm set.",
