Also, the DVD player doesn\u2019t\u2026play DVDs. It played one out of the 5 or so that I tried before I gave up. All the DVDs I chose work on our other DVD player. (See pictures for the error message I kept getting) So all around this was a major irritation. The $89 Insignia we had before this was 100% better quality. Buy this if you enjoy disappointment.",

                "reviewText": "I know what you're thinking: then why the 4 starz if it's basic with crappy speakers. Right? Ok, well I needed a TV with no \"smart\" capabilities---I just needed a basic flat screen TV (for a bedroom) which was fresh on the shelf with a low price tag. This one hit that mark. The picture is not horrible but it's also not spectacular either (better than some, not as great as many others.) Besides the attached power cable (I prefer the power cable to have its own designated port in), and its annoyingly shrill & raspy sound, this TV hit all my marks! Actually what's more important to me about a flat TV is connectivity & this model offered far more than most @ 720p/60hz. 3 HDMIs (in)[1 of which is ARC---it can interfere with the performance of the other HDMIs *and is also not eARC* so this contributed to the loss of 1 star], PC(w/ a PC sound port), fiberoptic digital audio (out), and (the piece of resistance) a superb grandfinal\u00e8 of a 3.5mm headphone AUX (out) port (this was just the best thing to find on the rear panel of the TV... ThE BeSt). Which brings me to my next point: speakers. Let's be honest, now; MoSt TVs have garbage for speakers (including many higher priced models). Well, with the ARC connectivity you can HDMI easily to a supporting soundbar or home theater system and with that fiberoptic or the AUX (outs), you can connect the TV sound easily even to older sound systems (just as I did with a Pioneer surround system from 2010). So the factory speakers were not a salepoint to me in the first place and barely affected the star rating at all. If you're looking for the perfect, all-in-1 TV; sound performance & detachable power cord had better not be a high priority for you with this model. However, if you need entertainment in another room from a smaller, better fitting screen size which happens to also support versatile connectivity; then this is the model for you to save some money on. And TV designers & retailers should take note here because many \"smart\" TVs are really a menace to deal with and some people know what they need without the \"smart\" functionalty; so maybe don't forget to stock some normal TVs for shoppers who are sick of how dumb many \"smart\" TVs actually are. Maybe design *ALL* TVs to have a smart *option* which can be used or not or even blocked from functioning so that the device will actually just work like a damned easy-to-use-basic TV. That's what I needed, that's what I found & bought so to me this TV is nothing but value -AnD- it's gravy to hook-up & use! But go get that great, big-ol' expensive picture & spectacular sound with its 1 (maybe 2) HDMI ports. My son is in his bedroom gaming & viewing on a pretty 32\" with surround & it was well below the projected \"son's room entertainment upgrade\" budget which made a happy wifey. *AnD* he loves it because whatever sound the TV should be making is perfectly synced & blasting with surround-depth-of-sound, without blinding him & backlight-bleach-fading the paint off the walls while also potentially causing photo induced seizures & motion sickness. Like I said, nothing but value competetively priced.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Wasn't configured to be a computer monitor in the least. The refund process is slow and irritating.",
                "reviewText": "I can't say anything about what sort of television this is, because we purchased it to use as a computer monitor to replace a similarly-sized (32 inch) TV that developed a power supply problem (they are not worth trying to repair). After many hours of trying to get this TV to work with our Windows 10 computer, we gave up and started the return process. We could never get the aspect ratio correct or even get the display centered, which is strange because we use TVs as monitors for both of our other computers, and all we had to do was connect them to the computer and everything works very well. The return process started smoothly, UPS picked the TV up from our house and it was back in the vendor's hands within a week of us purchasing it, per the UPS tracking which we followed closely. So far, the vendor has had their TV back for going on three weeks now, and yet no refund has been issued. I know Amazon says \"up to 30 days\" to receive a refund, but I don't see a reason for this delay, as the TV has been returned and received in very quick fashion. This TV is NOT a good choice if you intend to use it as a monitor, as many people do. Please don't expect a speedy refund if you choose to return it to the seller, however, no matter how quickly you return it to them. I can't give their customer service high marks at all because of this.UPDATE: The refund finally went through, after the seller had the TV back in their possession for nearly four weeks. This will definitely affect my willingness to purchase expensive items from Amazon in the future. There just isn't any excuse to act so slowly about refunding a person's money. When we contacted Amazon about the status of the refund, we were asked if we'd prefer a gift card instead of a refund, which took nerve on their part. I'll be purchasing my next TV or monitor from Walmart, I believe, where I can deal with these issues face-to-face should they happen.",
