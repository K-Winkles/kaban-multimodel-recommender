So I bought this 32\". Right size, easy to set up, picture is pretty good, sound is okay (we added a Bose mini speaker), doesn't take up the whole room. I wanted to be able to use this room for company and didn't want an oversized TV as the focal point - this 32\" fits that design idea. Worth the money for small rooms. Totally recommend!",

The picture is good too. Very easy set up. It comes with a roku remote but i purchased the ones with the headphone jacks as well. Would recommend for small rooms or for first TVs. Ill probably get one for my room.",

                "reviewText": "I've had it only about two weeks, but I bought it to replace a near identical Phillips one. The Phillips had constant sound loss issue, was slow changing between apps /channel, had poor remote response and then the Phillips one just died totally after having it only 8 months.So this one I'm very happy with right out of the box. Looks good, remote is great, & it's fast. But>>The speakers are not good, anything above 8 gives twangy feedback vibration \ud83d\ude11its super annoying. 8 is actually pretty loud, I never need to go above 15 for the sound, can't even guess what it would sound like over that?! I'm looking into getting a sound bar and hope that fixes the issue.If you're looking for a small roku I'd recommend but will need another speaker option. \ud83d\ude15",
