                "reviewText": "Got this TV shortly before x-mas and timing couln't be better. Now that most of the country is working from home, I wanted a better quality picture than the 5-YO Sony HD tv I had at home. Well, the picture quality is amazing, to say the least. Watching the NFL playoffs in January with this high def 4k picture makes you feel you are actually in the game. The picture is so crystal clear that it looks better than any sports video gave they have on the market. Not only that, but the smart features give you more control over the apps you have even on your cell. I have a Samsung S20Note Ultra and when connected to the TV, I can stream any video, application or even text messages to the TV. All my other video apps, like Disney, Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc are all pre-installed and picture quality when streaming them is truly amazing. Also, you have a lot of control over the picture quality so you can define your picture settings in a variety of ways. Samsung TV (came with the TV) also has a lot of options Well worth the $400 I spent on it. Wish I've done it sooner.",

                "reviewText": "The picture quality is SUPER crisp and nice and I use it mainly to watch YouTube or to play video games. I may have overdone it with a 65\" but the quality is worth it. The packaging came with a metal TV wall mount, an electrical socket thing that gives you 6 extra plugs, a few HDMI cords, and a packet of free subscriptions. I didn't use the subscriptions, but I was able to gift the wall mount to a friend who loved it, and so far the two HDMI cables have been great too. I have a game console and PC connected to the TV and both are able to switch seamlessly. If you have a Samsung phone there is an app that will let you control the TV with your phone and even cast your phone screen onto it. Lastly, I didn't think I would need the 6 socket plug in, but it ended up being helpful in a completely different part of the house. In all this purchase was definitely worth it!",
