                "reviewText": "Firstly, I purchased the 43 inch version with no sound bar. The packaging it was shipped in was the TV box with a shipping label, so everyone including your neighbors will know what you purchased including porch pirates, although with a package this big, I doubt that will make it any less enticing to steal if you have this issue.The tv comes with a smart remote, two legs that can be attacked to the tv with a screw and an hdmi cable. The power cable is preattached to the TV. The legs will not screw into the TV unit easily, so unless you have a really grippy screw driver and you\u2019re strong, I highly recommend purchasing an electric screwdriver to attach them. I purchased one from Amazon for $18 and it did the trick.The picture quality is as advertised, 1080p. Due to the size of the TV the pixels are definitely noticeable, but for the $200 I paid for it, the quality is beyond acceptable.The remote is really good, despite what other reviews may say. You absolutely will notice a lag when you press a button on the remote, as well as it being finicky registering keys if you do not pair it to the tv!!! The remote will work out of the box with the TV using the IR sensor on the TV but to pair it you have to go into the TV settings on the top right and go into remotes and accessories. Once there hold the button with 3 lines on the remote which is above the arrow buttons to the left for about 10 seconds and the remote will show up on the tv. Select the remote and it will be paired. After pairing you can point the remote in pretty much any direction and it registers instantly!The tv can be slow to respond sometimes even after the remote is paired but keep in mind the price you paid for the TV and it\u2019s a very small inconvenience in comparison and I consider myself picky.This tv has 2 hdmi ports and it is easy to switch between them using the input button. I can switch between my Nintendo Switch and Xbox with little issue.I am unsure if it just doesn\u2019t support it, but I was unable to connect the tv via WiFi to our 5Ghz network and had to use the 2.4Ghz network. I think it doesn\u2019t support the 5Ghz band but I\u2019m not sure.Overall, for the price and advertised features, I give it a 5 start review. As a TV in general, I give it 3 stars due to it being a bit slow to respond sometimes and the fact you must pair the Bluetooth out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "I got this on flash sale for just $200 - and it's a great product at this price point. 2 HDMI ports aren't enough for you? Boo-boo, grow up and buy an HDMI switch. I don't care about 4K (I don't have anything else that high-res), I just needed more screen real estate - Full HD is plenty good enough. I would've given it 5 stars if it was a non-\"smart\" TV, the android tv stuff is just a GIGANTIC bonus to me (I had a Chromecast on my old TV, and use Google Home quite a lot, so the built-in Chromecast on this TV is pretty sweet). The voice commands don't work on the remote that came with mine, but I really don't care. Only one of the 2 USB ports on the TV works, also not a problem for me. I can plug a keyboard into the working slot to control playback and type in search boxes, and HDMI-CEC lets me use not only the TV remote for my PS4, but my keyboard, too! It seems to only work on main menus and not in games, but I'm still impressed (If you set the HDMI-CEC to have them turn each other on, make sure you leave the TV on the home screen or a different input before you turn it off, otherwise the other device will turn on/off when you just want to use the TV, or vice-versa). I don't use built-in speakers, but the amplifier they have built-in has some serious juice. I barely have the TV and stereo volumes up at all, and it gets MORE than loud enough. The only actual complaint I have is that, when streaming spotify, the sound quality is not good. It might only be noticeable if you're an audiophile too, but it matters to me. Also you have to format any USB storage you try to plug in so that it only works on that TV? Never heard of that kind of crap, but my computer is hooked up right to the TV so it's only annoying in principle.If they tried to sell me this for even twice as much, I'd be a nay-sayer. But to do all this at just $200? I've been bragging about this TV to anyone that will listen!",

                "reviewText": "As a TV it's fine, I guess. Shows the pretty pictures, makes the noise. 10/10. Whatever.As a *smart*TV, however, something has gone terribly wrong. I'm curious where they got the hardware for this particular TV, because I have begun to deeply suspect they make trips to their local landfill to dig up the remnants of defunct toasters. I have never, in my modern life, been so frustrated with a device before.I once made the rookie mistake of trying to search for a show. It froze for upwards of a minute between each letter. When I mistakenly selected the wrong letter I briefly considered leaping off my balcony and running headfirst into traffic, as it might be less painful.You want to turn it on after it's been sitting off for a few days? Hah. You fool! This TV does not simply obey commands. Instead, turn on that part of your brain that warns you it's too cheap to be true.No, to use it again, you have to unplug it for 30 seconds to do a hard reset. In fact, that's a recurring theme with this TV. Been waiting 8 minutes for it to scroll through all those recommended shows you're definitely never gonna watch? Time to unplug. Video won't load? Unplug. Settings won't open? Unplug. You have never known frustration until you've spent 20 torturous minutes moving like a sloth through menus, found your show, somehow got it to load, only for the whole app to freeze. And... you guessed it. Time to unplug!Because of how useless it's been, I've barely used it in all the time I've owned it. I bought a Roku today in the hopes it will make this TV usable. But if you need to bring in a second brain because the first brain can't stop drooling everywhere, can we really call it a SmartTV?",
