This is an absolutely amazing TV. Picture is out of this world. SOOOO BIG 86\"! My only gripe is it only has 4GB of memory available for apps. My old 65\" Samsung had 8GB. What the heck Samsung?? I like the interface fine but will probably have to end up using a Firestick with it to get more apps on it. Also, the apps on a Firestick are updated more frequently. I hope Amazon comes out the a new Firstick soon with more than 8GB memory.",

Easily stands out from others in its category. Plus, buying it on Amazon had it to my door in less than 2 days.Awesome picture. Light weight, hung it on my wall, and very easy to set up with its universal remote. I also purchased the Vizio V21 sound bar; amazing sound enhancement ($159).Of note, the first TV delivered to me was shattered in several pieces in the box. It happens. So, I called Amazon and they had me a new one within 2 days. One phone call and 5 minutes setting up the re-order on the phone. Very professional customer service.",

When the package arrives and it\u2019s Hugh you will jump around like your kinds on Christmas when they got their first Sony PlayStation but calm down you\u2019re an adult. The picture I posted are of pacific beach in San Diego. The colors are great and the 2160 movies are crystal clear. The remote control is underwhelming but nbd.Do not expect any assistance from tech support at Samsung. They are clueless. You are on your own. Just start clicking buttons. The instruction manual is useless too. Again you are on you own. I have Alexa on everything but I cannot get it to work on the tv.Amazon says it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s problem and Samsung just doesn\u2019t know anything. So good luck with that. For the price this is an awesome bargain. Walmart is sold out and other stores are waiting to get it in. Samsung has a 2 month back order. I suggest if you are going purchase this tv do it now before Black Friday kicks in and the holidays kick in. I predict it will be sold out. Also if you are installing on a wall get a good installer as Samsung does not give out proper spec to the wall mount manufacturers so they may have to improvise . All in all great tv. Just wish there was a little more support from Samsung.BE VERY CAREFUL......the ad says they are sending you the 2021 version but the tv is registering on Alexa and other devices as a the 2020 version. Make it clear to Amazon that they are selling you a 2021 version not a 2020 version!! However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real difference in the 2020/2021 version but Amazon get it right!!!",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars OK TV BUT THE SCREEN IS VERY WEAK!!! AND WILL BREAK VERY EASY!!! AND ASURION DOES NOT COVER IT!!!",
                "reviewText": "I bought my tv in July 2023 with a wall mount bracket and hung it on the wall and purchased the Asurion 4-year protection plan on the tv. Mounted the tv up on the wall, I did notice the borderless design and screen were very flimsy and weak on this tv, but we were careful putting it up. Everything was fine until Thursday night October 12th when a storm came thru, and we had power fluctuations and brown outs causing all sorts of electrical issues that evening which caused my tv and a few other products in my house to fail. After the power outages and storms the tv would just blink on and off, on and off repeadly. So first I looked at the manufacturer's warranty and seen that it was only 1 month from date of purchase. Then I remembered that I purchased the Asurion 4-year protection plan, so I contacted them and did a claim. This was on the next Friday morning; it took them until the following Wednesday before they called me back to tell me that they received my claim and would assign it to a repair man to call me. Keep in mind this is my main tv in the house, during football season, now I wait another 3 days for the repair man to call me. He wants pictures of the tv, serial number, screen, oh and here is the kicker, if it is mounted on the wall it has to be taken down, plus you have to have a table big enough to lay the tv flat on so he can work on it. I was told this twice by the tv repair man before he would come to my house, the tv must be off the wall, on a flat table, with an extension cord. Keep in mind that this is an 85-inch tv that weighs over 100lbs built with a borderless screen. Tv guy finally shows up two weeks later, looks at my tv for 5 minutes, asks me for a flashlight. First, he says yep, your tv can't be fixed. I said OK, now what, then he said oh wait I think I see a crack. So, then he sets the tv up and he plugs the tv into power and it blinks on and off just like it did the night it went bad except now there is a slight crack in the middle top of the screen where he was grabbing the tv to set it up to plug it in. So now the TV guy takes pictures of the crack, packs up his stuff, heads out the door, jumps in his truck, and as he is backing out of my driveway says by the way the insurance company is going to deny your claim because you broke your screen. Maybe we did break it taking it down or maybe he broke it moving it around, who knows, all I know is that it was not broke when it was up on the wall when it started blinking. So, in a nutshell I did like the tv, remote was good. picture was good. Screen was flimsy and weak, borderless design sucks, tv is heavy, and when it is setting on its legs it will wobble some. I would try and find an insurance that will cover the screen if you buy this TV! Also, when this TV arrived at my house the Box looked like it was in World War 3, I took pictures of it before I even opened it thinking the tv was probably broke before I even opened the box. So don't be surprised if the box looks bad when it arrives. So, there's my $1600 on a Samsung 86-inch smart tv down the drain with insurance review story! Also, Poor manufactures warranty Come on Samsung at least put a 1 year on your products.",

I even get a little vertigo when watching movies because of the diminished baseline for my peripheral vision. My suggestion to others when buying this is to always get the white glove delivery. They cam up to my house, unpackaged the TV, put the stand on, and placed in on my TV stand. Then they removed the packaging film and hauled away the box. I then turned it on in front of them and verified everything works. I then signed a document stating everything works. I see the one star reviews with this TV are almost always issues with damage. This will prevent this from happening. The delivery crew service was above and beyond for sure!",
