                "reviewText": "This TV has had constant issues with SMARTCAST not loading and becoming non functional for all Smart TV apps. The Audio keeps getting out of sync with video causing me to have to reboot the TV to get it to work. The only way I can get SMARTCAST to start working is to either reboot the TV and I've even had to factory Reset the TV... This was a great price, but not worth the hassle and it still isn't working correctly. I got fed up and hooked up a Roku just so I could watch Netflix again... I wouldn't buy this TV or even Vizio again... Skip this one and buy a better quality product.",

                "reviewText": "Update to the previous update below: The software in the TV is what indicates the V505-H9... the actual model number on the label on the back of the TV says V505-H19. So I really don't know WHAT I have.Though it is confusing and disappointing, I'm actually still pretty happy with the quality of the TV.Update: I've just realized that the TV that I actually received is the model V505-H9 -- NOT the V505-H19 as in the Amazon listing. The V505-H9 was released in 2019, the V505-H19 in 2020. The box that it was shipped in has a V505-H19 sticker on it... I still like the TV, but now wonder about it's lifespan and any tweaks that Vizio might have made for the 2020 model. I *AM* disappointed and feel that I was deceived! My overall rating has been downgraded accordingly to three stars from five.Original Review:I've only had this Vizio Smart TV for less than 24 hours, but so far I'm quite happy with my purchase. This set replaces a 2015 43 inch Vizio... and the improvement in quality, in virtually every way, is significant! I'm still exploring all of the ways to fine tune the picture for my environment, not to mention the myriad ways to stream from a wide variety of sources, including Apply AirPlay.I'll check back in and update if I have any gripes or other surprising revelations, but my initial impressions are very positive. \ud83d\udc4d",
