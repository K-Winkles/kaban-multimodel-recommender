I use the Roku instead of the bigger, fancier brand. Roku's picture quality, brightness, sound, and everything works well and is all I need. Where I REALLY appreciate the Roku is the ease of use. Many of the newer TVs have \"magic\" remotes which are like Wii controllers, are complicated to use, flash ads, require software updates, passwords, and all sorts of processes to just watch a simple TV show. It's so tedious and such a hassle, I don't like turning it on. The Roku has all the apps and technology I need, but is simple to set-up and use. I get to WATCH TV, not enter passwords, dodge ads, and navigate the TV like a game system. I am a loyal Roku fan at this point!",

I had a Roku wireless sound bar and did not want to have to replace it because I changed formats. So are there better TV's for the money, perhaps but for our purposes the picture is quite good (really 4 1/2 stars). I got the TV on sale and there again you might find a TV less expensive, but this fulfilled our needs (also 4 1/2 stars)I think the main selling feature is the way Roku and the remote works. It is easy to find what you are looking for once you get use to how it works.",

Setup was easy and quick, just had to charge the remote for a few minutes, but the results were worth it. Great TV at a decent price.",

I have other TVs in my house and they don\u2019t have those issues. The audible alarm to find the remote is a plus. Not sure how I feel about another device to able to listen to me just to use the \u201chey Roku\u201d feature, you can toggle it off. It\u2019s nice to connect all your devices to the tv and control through Roku. I am huge Roku fan, but they missed the bar on this. I even waited for the price to drop from $500 to $400. I would not waste your time. I will be returning mine.",
