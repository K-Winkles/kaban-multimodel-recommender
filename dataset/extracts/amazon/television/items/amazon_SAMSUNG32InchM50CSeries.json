I love that Samsung gives you so many free TV channels.This was really easy to set up as a monitor for my laptop as well. I am looking forward to working from home on my laptop and being able to use this as my display.The price was really fair for this. I know there are 50\u201d TV\u2019s in the same price range however they don\u2019t have the same features as the Samsung.",

I would only use Airplay (wireless Mac screen extension) in case of emergency because that picture quality is bad and mouse moves very slow. Maybe a regular monitor with a Firestick connected would have fulfilled my needs (work monitor/streaming device/built in speaker) but I wasn't sure if remote volume control would work. All in all I think it was worth 279 for these needs. Also, I'm not sure how well it works with remote windows connection (no physical pc present) but if that's a thing you want to do and assuming it works well then I think there's no question this is good value.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I've had it for a few weeks now, and I regret buying it more by the day.The picture is BAD, both as a TV and as a computer monitor. It's so bad at light-to-dark transitions that simple scene changes look like there are ambulances flashing lights in the background.And the menus are bad. You can't hide stuff you don't use, like Samsung TV. You can't organize all the stuff you use on one screen.And worst of all, it shows advertisements! There is no way to turn them off. I paid for this TV, but I have to look at ads. Samsung's response to customer complaints is to call ads a \"more enriching experience\". !I stopped using Samsung phones a few years ago because of low quality and endless junk apps and ads. I guess I won't be buying anything else from them either.Original ReviewWell, it was cheap and it does work as both a TV and a monitor.It's not great at either. It has terrible ghosting issues -- if parts of the screen change from light to dark too quickly it leaves a white space like a negative for a split second. It's not too bad on TV, but it's really bad while playing video games. Everything looks like it has a magic spell cast on it.The tv is okay. Ghosting issues and bad Soap Opera Effect, but I figured out how to turn that down.The menus are awkward and clearly not designed for my convenience. The remote was okay once I figured out how to use it: no clear instructions and if you accidentally press the volume button it takes you off to wonderland.I don't regret my purchase, but next time I'll spend a little more money.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a Samsung Monitor, and my overall experience with it has been a mixed bag. While the display quality is satisfactory, the remote control functionality has been a significant disappointment. Operating the monitor with the remote control requires a great deal of patience, as it is not very user-friendly.Let's start with the positive aspect\u2014the display. The monitor boasts a decent display quality, delivering clear and vibrant visuals. Whether for work or entertainment purposes, the display meets the basic expectations of a modern monitor.However, when it comes to the remote control experience, the monitor falls short. Navigating through the menu and adjusting settings with the remote control can be a frustrating task. The remote control interface is not intuitive, and it often requires multiple attempts to successfully navigate and make changes. This lack of user-friendliness can be a significant drawback for those seeking a hassle-free experience.One notable aspect of the Samsung Monitor is its range of features. It offers a variety of options and settings to enhance the viewing experience. However, these features come with a downside\u2014the monitor's overall performance suffers due to its slow response times. Actions such as switching between inputs or adjusting settings can be sluggish, resulting in a less than optimal user experience.While the monitor provides multiple features, it falls short of perfection. The slow response times and cumbersome remote control navigation detract from its potential. As a user, I expected a smoother and more efficient performance.In conclusion, the Samsung Monitor offers a satisfactory display quality, but its remote control experience is a major letdown. Navigating the menu and adjusting settings can be frustrating and time-consuming. Additionally, the monitor's performance suffers from slow response times, compromising its overall usability. If you prioritize a user-friendly interface and swift performance, this monitor may not be the ideal choice. Consider exploring alternative options that offer a more seamless and efficient experience.",

I have many gripes with it, and was going to keep it, until it started flashing on and off by itself (three times while I was sharing my screen during a teams meeting). Why on earth does this thing turn itself off?Other issues:- sometimes won't even turn on- if you lose the remote it is useless. There are no buttons to turn it on and off or navigate- you need the remote to make it work because it goes to a screen with the 'smart monitor' options and from there you choose to cast your computerEven with caveat that I won't be able to use the remote, I was going to keep it. It sucks, but the speakers are decent, and the idea of having a smart monitor was appealing because you don't even need your computer to access Office 365. You can do it directly from the smart monitor. Where it lost me was it not turning on and today, turning off and on by itself during a teams meeting. It is absolutely the most frustrating thing.You want something that functions like a basic monitor. The add ons can be great, but it should still function like a basic easy to use monitor. This doesn't do that.Worst of all, it doesn't have any buttons, so if you lose the remote, good luck.Also the layout of the remote sucks. Who decided angling a left right button up or down would be a good idea for a volume or up navigation.This is good in theory but executed very very poorly.",
