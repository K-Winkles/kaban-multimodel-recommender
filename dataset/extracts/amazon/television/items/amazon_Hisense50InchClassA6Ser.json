                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Hisense 43A6H is a very good 43 inch 4k smart TV for a low price.",
                "reviewText": "Several labels on and in the box warn that the actual screen should not be touched when lifting the TV out of the box, or when moving it around, because the panel can be cracked easily under direct pressure from a strong grip. This actually applies to most new TVs.I carefully held the TV by the thin frame when moving it around. It is very light at 15 pounds, however.Feet are about 33 inches apart. Easy to wall mount.I use the Hisense 43A6H primarily as a computer monitor, and for occasional TV or movie watching. 43 inches is a great size monitor for people with vision problems.Viewed from 4 feet away, I could not see any pixels. The 4K resolution allows text to appear very smooth on the screen.The IPS panel allows viewing from wider angles without the picture becoming dimmer - unlike VA panels which become dimmer when viewed from wide angles.The remote control has a large flat base, so it can stand vertically on a table. There are no number buttons on the remote control to directly choose a channel. The 123 button on the remote can be used to easily access a TV channel if one does not want to use the microphone - or if one does not want to repeatedly press the channel up/down button.I recently discovered TubiTV online, so I appreciate having a dedicated button for it on the remote control.The picture is easy to adjust. There are more video calibration controls and audio controls than I expected for a budget 4K television, but the colors seemed accurate out of the box.Bluetooth easily pairs the TV with the remote control and wireless headphones.There is a low blue light setting in the picture advanced settings menu. This minimizes eye strain when looking at the TV for long periods of time.Tech Steve has a good video showing how to use the variable refresh rate feature for video game consoles. The video is at the bottom of the Amazon page for this TV. Thanks, Steve.Sound is typical small TV speaker sound, but not screechy. I use a receiver to send audio to speakers next to the TV.There is a headphone jack as well as a digital optical audio out jack.The tuner picked up more than 100 over the air channels in the SF Bay area, using a flat indoor antenna taped to the window.The 1080p and 720p over the air signals looked great. Blu-Ray discs looked stunning.Casting from a phone was easy.The streaming apps worked fine, using both Wi-Fi and wired ethernet. Extra apps can be downloaded from google through the TV. The first time I turned on the TV, it automatically tried to connect to the internet via Wi-Fi. I prefer the wired ethernet connection for reliability reasons.The two USB ports each can support 128 Gigabyte USB memory sticks as well as 8 Terabyte hard drives - as long as they are in either NTSF or FAT32 formats.One of the three HDMI 2.0 ports has eARC.The Easy Setup guide in the box is actually a 24 page booklet, all in English. A more detailed multi-language e-manual can be viewed on the TV or downloaded onto a computer.For privacy reasons, I have not signed up for the built-in Google assistant app yet - and because I wanted to see how the TV performed without the Google or Alexa voice feature. So I have not tried the voice control on the remote control. The TV works fine if the microphone and Google TV features are not used.*I am very happy with this budget 4K television. No stuck pixels. Easy to set up. It worked fine right out of the box.Highly recommended.",

I sit in front so it doesn't matter to me. after about 25-30 degrees angle, the pic gets washed out. the sound is meh. I bought the Amazon sound bar, mates quite well with this tv. all and all of I'm very happy with this purchase for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This TV is quite lite for its size and has a very good picture from straight on , that is based on only 13 days is service so durability is not yet known. The sound is useable in a 24 by 14 room but I have attached it to a high end sound system so its not applicable. The fiber optic audio out works fine. The remote does not make it easy to get around the channels but that is true of google TV on its own, not necessarily the TV. The TV has many options and some are hard to find or depend on other settings which are not clear, but the basics are very easy to set up. I have voice remote but the instructions tell of a switch under the tv to set for hands free, and it doesn't exist. Over all an excellent value for a TV this size and cost ($399 when I bought it). On other note the TV does not have a standard RCA jack for video in which may affect hook up of an older DVD player. The TV does not come with a printed users manual and the content is to long and complicated for the electronic version to be helpful. That should be corrected but I assume is a cost cutting factor. The view deteriorates fairly quickly jf viewed from an angle, but remains useable. I am very pleased with the TV overal. Now if it lasts its great. I don't use the TV for gaming so the rating would have been NA if that was available",

                "reviewText": "This TV is great image quality and intuitive navigation at a bargain price. If you use Google Home, it will effortlessly synch all your apps onto the home screen instantly with a quick QR code scan (think YouTube, YouTubeTV, Spotify, MAX, Prime, etc...) without having to download and sign in to every app individually - this was a delight. I've seen other similar priced TVs with lower image quality (TCL for sure worse than this at similar price point). Light and easy to hang. Very happy with purchase. Only reason it's not 5* is because you can spend a lot more money to get impeccable image quality which is better than this, but this is as good as it gets for the price. You can spot minor/blurry blending imperfections if you're up close to the screen, but from any distance it looks totally fine and natural. Dark images appear smooth and clean and not a confusing mix of gray and black pixels like you see on TCL.PS: I have this TV situated in a living room w limited natural light - no glare from sun whatsoever - and it works well in this setting.",

                "reviewText": "For a budget TV don't hesitate. I was skeptical and picky but just needed a TV for the spare room. What the heck, it's inexpensive with some nice features. The android interface is smooth and full featured even if it's proprietary. The TV almost has as many settings and fine tuning settings of my 6x more expensive TV. After some adjustments the picture is great. The remote is limited but works great and is voice capable. I use an old 5.1 sound system with toss/optical with no problem. (some channels and apps I have to change the output setting. But if you have a newer 'hdmi' sound bar you shouldn't have to) I'm not a professional/fanatical gamer but all my PC games on Steam look good. Only 60fps but minimal if any lag/latency. Is it as good as my my dedicated 120hz PC monitor? No, but for the games I want on a 50inch screen it's great. HDR is in the \"eye of the beholder\" and over-sold in my opinion. As long as the 4k picture looks great, I can live without it. But the 4k and HDR looks as good as my other TV.Also... 1080p, 720p and even 480p scale and looks great. (like any TV, you will have to adjust the settings) I have not found any fault, quirk or problem with set. If my Sony goes out I'm moving this to the living room.",
