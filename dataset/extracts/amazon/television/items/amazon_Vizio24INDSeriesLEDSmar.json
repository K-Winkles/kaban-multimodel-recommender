The images are very clear but I can only use the Apps through Wi-Fi and the TV lost signal and take too much times to reboot and I tried to cable Verizon Fios services they fix it but after a couple of days it stopped receiving cable services. If I knew I would probably read the reviews carefully before I made that choice. So far I am spending more money on cable services and the TV is somewhat useless because it was a gift and my aunt does not care too much for smart tv and I thought that was not going to be a problem but I was wrong. That TV is smart for it's own good. I thing the product is defected.",

I changed the batteries in the remote as well as unplugged & then plugged it back in a few times. It has done this before several times & after unplugging it for a few seconds, it came back on. But today that has not worked; it is dead. The other day I turned it on & there was no picture, although I had audio. I turned it off & then on & the picture came back. So it has been misbehaving on & off all summer--very disappointing for a brand new TV. It is too late to return it to Amazon so I am hoping that the seller will do the right thing.",

                "reviewText": "Had it for almost a month now, works great, picture looks good, and the smart aspect of the tv feels very quick and responsive. Only 2 complaints...1. Vizio, for whatever reason, decided to downgrade the resolution from last year's model (1080p down to 780p). I have no idea why they did this, but I think that's what's driving the high cost of last year's model (currently ~$290 for the 2016 and only $200 for the 2017). 2. Unless you plan on getting exactly a 100x100 vesa mount wall bracket, you will find that the I/O's in the back are rather poorly placed. I bought a 23-55\" wall mounting bracket with this tv and I ended up having to take a grinder to it to expose the power and Hdmi jacks. If the ports were facing down, instead of straight out the back, I doubt this would have been an issue.",
