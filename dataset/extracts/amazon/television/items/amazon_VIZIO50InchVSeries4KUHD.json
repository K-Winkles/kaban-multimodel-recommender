                "reviewText": "This tv is more of a pain then it should be. When it\u2019s not causing problems, it\u2019s an easy 3 stars. When the tv works, it\u2019s fine. Not great. Just fine. The picture looks good enough and it has most of the apps I need (doesn\u2019t have xfinity streaming or most sports apps).However, there has been a host of problems ever since I bought this. There are constant updates which change the layout of the Home Screen every few months, meaning I have to go back and search for apps I regularly use (Netflix, Hulu etc). Other times apps will just crash or freeze or not load at all and need to be deleted then reinstalled and resigned in.For awhile the sound kept messing up until I found a solution online to change a bunch of \u201cadvanced settings\u201d. Why this is not included in the manual or better yet have the default setting actually work is beyond me. Likewise I had to calibrate the HDR setting because this thing will randomly increase the backlight and burn your eyes out if not properly set.But the biggest pain is that sometimes the tv will flat out not work. Sometimes it won\u2019t turn on at all, other times you can see the backlight come on but there\u2019s just a blank/black screen or one of the inputs won\u2019t work but everything else will. Or it will just crash. At least once a month, I have to do a manual reset of unplugging the tv then holding down the power button on the tv to clear its cache. This is a pain because A) the power button is on the back of this big tv making it hard to reach especially if it\u2019s on the wall and B) the outlet is also hard to get to.Now sure you could say that\u2019s my fault for having the tv on the wall and the outlet not easily accessible, but come on. A TV should not have these kind of problems. You should just be able to plug it in once and never have to worry about it. No other tv have I ever had to manual restart, especially this frequently. Do yourself a favor and go buy literally any other brand other than Vizio.",
