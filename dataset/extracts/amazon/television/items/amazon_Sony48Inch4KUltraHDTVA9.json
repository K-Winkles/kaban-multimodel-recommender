                "reviewText": "I have always been happy with Sony products. More expensive but they hold up for years. I have a 48 inch Bravira that I bought 15 years ago and it still works like new. If your looking for an inexpensive 42\u201d set just to watch TV in a small room, look elsewhere. The picture is absolutely beautiful and perfect. OLED displays may not beat LCDs in overall brightness but the image is hard to describe adequately. Colors are pure and rich. Blacks go fully black but show remarkable detail in the dark ranges. No brightness or image shift when you move off center of the screen. Very good up-conversion from SD and HD sources. While it is a high end Google TV, it plays well with Apple devices too. It has only 3 HDMI inputs, one is high speed for a gamer\u2019s PlayStation. This is a great unit for gamers. Low lag and no smear. This set is really a natural born streamer. HBO Max, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Google TV, Disney, and almost all services just work well and play 4K UHD without a hiccup. I didn\u2019t need to hook up my Apple TV or Amazon box. It almost magically controls my cable box. It\u2019s not a universal remote, the set itself links the cable box on my network. The remote is small and solid and appears very minimal button wise but works with the set where most remote functions are on screen. There is a mic in the remote with Google assistant. I push a button ask for a specific movie. The set finds the film and connects to the service that is carrying it. Functions switch to whatever source you are watching. This is a smart TV but setting it up requires a steep learning curve. The instructions are a bit vague on details and assume you understand about connecting things to your home network and understand the different sources and connecting services. I\u2019m a broadcast engineer and understand all this but it still took a while to set everything up and if I\u2019m complaining about complexity, I can imagine what it would be like for the average consumer. The sound is quite good for a small flat panel TV. Because of the thin OLED screen, Sony is able to use it as the speaker surface as well. There is a rear facing woofer for decent Bass. This is the first flat panel set I bought where I feel I didn\u2019t need a sound bar just to watch. This is not rumble your guts surround sound but just decent sound on its own. It has a good equalizer and even a dialogue enhance setting. It connected nicely to my Bluetooth headset. It\u2019s expensive but it holds its own with the larger high end OLED sets. Perfect for watching from 6 feet away at my kitchen table.",

                "reviewText": "*This review is for the 42\" XR42A90K.*We recently finished a major remodel of our kitchen and capped off the project by ordering the Sony XR42A90K. Our kitchen gets a lot of traffic and frequently doubles as my wife's office, so we wanted a TV in the room but not something that would overwhelm the space. The 42\" A90K is a fantastic option, having installed it and used it for a bit.My house is a Sony TV house, having moved away from Samsung products and their awful app environment, short support windows, and subpar performance (in my opinion). This is the fourth Sony TV in our home, and the second OLED. I know LG OLEDs also receive very good reviews, but having a common platform in my house, and one my wife and kids are already familiar with pushed us to the Sony OLED.\u25baPicture Quality:I am not a professional TV reviewer, but in my estimation it's hard to beat the picture on a Sony OLED. Our A90K is located in a very bright kitchen and performs terrifically! The picture is very bright, while still offering excellent deep blacks and contrast. Any worry about glare was washed away shortly after powering the TV on for the first time.\u2192Concerns about burn-in:I've owned a Sony Master-series OLED in my home theater for years and the TV has not experienced any burn-in at all. I frequently game on that set, for reference, and it's worked great for four years without any noticable burn-in. So, I have no concerns with the A90K at all.\u25baGoogle TV:One of the biggest selling points on Sony TVs is the integration with Google TV. It's incredibly easy to setup (using the Google Home App), and use. My wife and I have Google's Pixel series Android phones, and the integration with our phones is fantastic - for example, we display a rotating album of our favorite family pictures on all of our Sony TVs when they enter stand-by mode. It's one of our favorite features and requires very little user input to get it set up.The next best thing is the responsiveness of Sony TVs. Switching from app to app, or from cable is a breeze and the A90K responds immediately. I contrast that experience with our awful Samsung TVs that had noticeable lag when pressing any button.\u25baI/O:\u2192 4 \u00d7 HDMI -- 2 \u00d7 @ HDMI 2.1 (inputs 3, 4); 2 \u00d7 @ HDMI 2.0 (inputs 1, 2)\u2192 2 \u00d7 USB 3.0\u2192 1 \u00d7 Optical out\u2192 1 \u00d7 Ethernet\u2192 1 \u00d7 IR (input)\u2192 1 \u00d7 RS232C\u2192 1 \u00d7 Composite (requires adapter, not included in the box)\u25baOther Things:\u2192 The A90K comes removeable plastic backplates that cover areas like the cord and I/O. They're great for completing a clean, minimalist look. I have my TV mounted on our kitchen wall but still installed the plates since they cover up part of the side panel too. Again, purely aesthetic, but I love the finished look.\u2192 There's a mic mute toggle on the side of the TV. If you want a more privacy and aren't interested in using the Google Voice Assistant, turn the mic to mute.\u2192 I do not use the included stand but I do appreciate that it's made out of metal and not flimsy plastic.\u2192 The TV does use on-screen ads (unfortunately). I believe that most TVs these days have them, and it sucks. At least they're unobtrusive and you can opt out of personalized ads when you perform the first-time configuration.\u2192 The remote is compact but excellent. It feels great in-hand and sturdy. It has a minimalist approach to buttons which is great in a household with kids.\u25baIn the Box:\u2192 A90K TV\u2192 Remote control\u2192 2 \u00d7 AAA batteries\u2192 Base plate and metal legs\u2192 2 \u00d7 Cable management straps\u2192 Manual, user guides, and warranty information\u25baClosing:That's it! This TV is fantastic and I'm very pleased with my purchase. The picture quality is fantastic, The user interface, sound, inputs are all the top-notch Sony quality I'm used too! This is definitely a TV I recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I always buy Sony, even though they are pretty expensive. So did not compare with any other TV in the market. And straight bought Sony OLED TV. Good picture quality, great sound, the remote has backlight feature and also voice commands. Could have bought bigger 55\u201d or 65\u201c with slightly more money (55\u201d was 200 cad more while 65\u201d was 550 cad more), but settled with 48\u201d for ease of setting up (I live alone, bigger size would have been trouble for setting up - size and weight).",
