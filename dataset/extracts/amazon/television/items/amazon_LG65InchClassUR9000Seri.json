                "reviewText": "So everyone complains about sound on a led flat screen. Let\u2019s be honest if you get any flat screen tv for the sound you\u2019re not too smart of a consumer. They are meant for picture. Sound here is actually decent. But let\u2019s be real. Get a sound bar set up. I got the Vizio 5.1 surround sound unit with wireless subwoofer and it works perfectly with this tv.Picture quality is great here. For the price point, this 4KUHD is a great option. Glad I purchased it. The interface is fine but I use the fire stick so I\u2019ll stick with that. No issues with refresh rate in sports, wrestling, movies or games. Now a SONY 4k tv was what I wanted, but at the same size Sony wanted 300-$400 more and I just didn\u2019t see the need to spend that. Especially when this one was a 4K tv at a price that made more sense. I purchased the 50 inch",

I even have a 65\" like the one I just purchased, but several years old.Picture quality is fine, but the sound is not good at all. Sounds tinny and hollow, unlike all of my other LG's that sound great even without a sound bar.I broke down and purchased a LG 3.1 soundbar which makes it better but still not what it should be or as good as the older ones I have.Overall, I like the TV and the picture is fine, remote is a little marginal, but the sound is poor in comparison.",

She uses the set in a moderately bright room, and the television image is never washed out because of ambient light The picture is bright and clear, and the operating system functions smoothly. I have an LG QNED 90 in my living room, and this set comes very close to that set's mini-LED picture quality. The TV upscales SD content very well. I recommend this set over some of the less expensive offerings from other brands.",

I'm not using any of the built in \"smart\" features.When I first got it I looked around the menus and yeah, they are slow/sluggish (os issue?). But using it as a \"dumb\" tv (with wifi disabled), works great. Powers on very fast, powers off just as fast. Looks beautiful.The little built in speakers sound about how you'd expect, so get a sound bar with it if you want fuller/louder sound.Overall very happy with this, and the price is very fair.",

                "reviewText": "I've barely gotten it out of the box and it is now listed here for $30 less than I paid for it. I overpaid - you shouldn't!The TV itself feels about average for this size. The picture is good, but not insanely great. The remote is unnecessarily complex - it has a point-to-move-the-cursor feature that works for some things and not others, even within LG's operating system functions, but the only \"OK\" button is also the wheel that activates the cursor. The OTA tuner picks up 10% fewer channels than the cheap Insignia it is replacing. The audio is tinny so I'll have to find a way to wedge in some kind of sound bar.The box and the TV itself all have \"New for 2023\" language on them but I really can't find a practical difference between this and the older model.Overall, meh, but I overpaid for meh!",
