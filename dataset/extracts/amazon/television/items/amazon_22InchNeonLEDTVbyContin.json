Sometimes smaller TVs are exactly what you need for the space. In fact, sometimes smaller is way better than bigger. I have a 7-in monitor on my kitchen shelf that I use as a TV when I work at the counter.This 22-in TV is pretty nifty. The fact that it is clear, with the LED lighting, is pretty neat.1080 resolution is all you would really need with something this size and the picture is nice and crisp.The remote works well.The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the sound quality. It is a bit tinny. I'm going to hook up a soundbar to it in order to hopefully fix it. Not worth deducting for that, just worth mentioning.",

She doesn't have cable in her room so I got a fire stick and it works great. Very colorful on the ambient lighting, and the picture comes in crystal clear. Easy enough to set up and the remote works fine. A little pricey, but most of them are. Fair deal.",

                "reviewText": "So...when the opportunity to order this showed up, I had just done some rearranging and the idea of another smaller TV for a spot in my home seemed just great. And so I ordered this. Truth is I don't have any young children. And I didn't pay very close attention to the fact this is not a smart TV. I was simply excited that it was in my mind WHITE for decor reasons.Then somehow it occurred to me that this is not a smart TV. No worries. I simply ordered a fire stick for it. Probably the thing that was most disappointing is that had I known it would take as long as it did to arrive, I may have simply passed. Now I do not know if that will be your experience and in the big picture a couple of months from now I won't even truly care about that.I wasn't actually expecting the sort of translucent nature of this TV. I have mixed feelings about it. And by translucent I mean instead of being white it is kinda see-through. Like when I look at the back I see all the components and such that make the TV work. Kinda cool and yet, sort of annoys me too. Still, that is subjective.Also, this asks about the remote. The remote works just fine. It came with batteries. It was easy to set up and get to work. It also has a bit of a translucent aesthetic.I have a similar sort of take it or leave it about the built-in lights around the TV. I AM glad that they are easily turned on and off via the remote.I was a bit put off that the HDMI port is sort of tucked away and so connecting the Fire Stick I had to use that hanging thingy. Why? I don't like the look of it. And yet, again...subjective...personal preference. If you don't care about that...and big picture it does not take away from the TV functioning.Probably the one true thing that was kind of interesting is that when I set up the Fire Stick, in order to be able to control the volume from the Fire Stick, I had to choose the brand of this TV. There were literally at least 50 brands to chose from and this brand was not on the list. So, I have to use both remotes to work this TV. Not a deal breaker for me. If you care, just maybe good for you to know then.",

I wish they had put a little more effort in to the sound quality rather than the LED neon effects. At least it\u2019s not a smart TV that spies on you. That\u2019s another reason I bought this one. No camera or microphone that I could tell.If you have a Soundsystem to hook it up to then it should be fine. But otherwise I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be happy with this.",
