                "reviewText": "The LG C3 OLED is the latest model in LG\u2019s popular C series of OLED TVs, which have consistently delivered excellent picture quality and features for high-end shoppers or for shoppers looking for something closer in price to mid-range TVs while delivering S-tier performance. The C3 OLED boasts a sleek and minimalist design with an ultra-thin panel. The C3 OLED also supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs with various gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz, VRR, ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync12. For the purposes of my review, we're going to focus on gaming, as that's been my overwhelming, primary use for this TV since it arrived and I got it all setup a little over a month ago. Here are my thoughts for the gamers reading this, and I hope it helps you make a decision -- this is for the 65\" model:The LG C3 OLED is a great TV for gaming on various platforms, and I have connected and used virtually every type of gaming experience, such as PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and even my ROG Ally. Here are some details about its gaming performance:- The LG C3 OLED supports 4K 120Hz gaming on all four HDMI 2.1 ports, which means you can enjoy smooth and detailed gameplay on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), FreeSync Premium Pro, and Nvidia G-Sync, which can reduce screen tearing and stuttering and optimize the input lag.- The LG C3 OLED has a very low input lag of around 10ms, which is ideal for fast-paced games that require quick reactions. The TV also has a near-instant response time of less than 1ms, which means motion blur is minimal and action scenes are clear and crisp.- The LG C3 OLED has a wide color gamut and a high contrast ratio, which can deliver stunning HDR gaming with vivid colors and deep blacks. The TV supports Dolby Vision IQ, which can adjust the HDR picture based on the ambient light in the room, and HGiG, which can optimize the HDR gaming experience according to the TV's capabilities.- The LG C3 OLED can also handle lower-resolution gaming well, thanks to its upscaling technology that can enhance the image quality of 1080p or 1440p content. The TV can also play 8- and 16-bit games from the Nintendo Switch without any noticeable banding or artifacts.- The LG C3 OLED has a new feature called Game Optimizer, which is a dedicated menu that allows you to adjust various gaming settings, such as black stabilizer, white stabilizer, low latency mode, and sound mode. You can also access the Game Optimizer from the Magic Remote by pressing the Game Optimizer button.Overall, the LG C3 OLED is a versatile and impressive TV for gaming on different platforms, and it can provide a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience that won't break the bank.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW! If you\u2019ve only had LCD TVs in the past, the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image. My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldn\u2019t be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room I\u2019ve found it\u2019s plenty bright enough, and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before (Vizio M658-G1). LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports for 4k/120Hz Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, ALLM, etc. I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing! I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k! Everything I\u2019ve watched on it looks better than ever before and I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options:- Compared to the LG G3: A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity. The G3 is noticeably brighter but, like I said, I haven\u2019t felt like the C3 wasn\u2019t bright enough and it was brighter than I expected- Compared to the Samsung S95C: Again, much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner, especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV. The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues, poor firmware updates, and no Dolby Vision HDR support- Compared to LG C2: The C3 is very similar to the C2 and it\u2019s hard to justify the price increase of the C3. It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more. The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20,000 zones instead of 5,000 and is a little bit brighter. It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2. A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes. That issue was fixed on the 2023 models. Lastly, the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu that\u2019s nice for changing settings in a snap- Compared to Samsung S90C: This is the C3\u2019s biggest competition this year because they are close in price. The S90C has the better QD-OLED panel and is brighter and more colorful. I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C. I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come. Also, QD-OLED appears to have more risk of burn-in and I like to keep my TVs for a long time- Compared to Samsung S95B (2022 model): I wanted a 77\u201d TV and the S95B only comes in 55\u201d and 65\u201d. Also, Samsung issues I mentioned beforeConclusion: The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people. Everything I\u2019ve watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED. They\u2019ve been making them longer than anyone else and they\u2019ve figured out how to prevent burn-in for the vast majority of users. If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isn\u2019t for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies, TV shows, gaming, etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy. Unless you can afford the LG G3, of course",
