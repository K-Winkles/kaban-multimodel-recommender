                "reviewText": "Modern television are increasingly extensions of computer technology and they all have one thing in common; a lack of useful documentation. Pairing my Xfinity ( or FIOS) remote to the TV has been frustrating. Turning on thr TV requires answering \u201cWho\u2019s Watching\u201d then speaking HDMI One to reach Xfinity when all I want most of the time is only TV. Perhaps there is a way to default to HDMI one but so far I have not figured it out and the website documentation is barely useful.Regardless, the image quality is excellent. There are more apps than I care to count. I have an older optical only sound bar that cannot interface with the HDMI-ARC feature But that is my problem and not Amazon. Of course, Amazon does offer a good sound bar at a reasonable price supporting HDMI \u2013 ARC.This is the second Fire TV I have purchased this year and the interface issues are the same for both. They are reasonably priced and they both perform well. I don\u2019t believe there are any fundamental problems and perhaps it is \u201cmy bad\u201d that I do not speak Amazoneese",
