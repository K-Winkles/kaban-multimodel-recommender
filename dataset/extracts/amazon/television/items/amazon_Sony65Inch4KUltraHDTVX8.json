                "reviewText": "I recently purchased two Sony 65\" TVs and was so impressed by their value for the price that I decided to upgrade one to a 75\" model. The decision to upgrade was easy, given the exceptional price-to-value ratio these TVs offer. From the moment I turned them on, the quality of both the image and sound was evident. The picture quality is crisp and vibrant, making for an immersive viewing experience whether I'm watching movies, sports, or streaming content. The sound quality is equally impressive, with clear, rich audio that fills the room without the need for an external sound system.What truly sets these Sony TVs apart is their excellent price-value proposition. In an era where high-quality TVs can come with a hefty price tag, Sony has managed to offer top-notch quality at a very reasonable price. This aspect alone makes it a highly recommendable choice for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment setup without breaking the bank.",

It may cost a bit more than the competition but BELIEVE ME guys\u2026It is WORTH IT. The interface is incredibly fast, smooth and clean. The colors look AMAZING in day or night. And if you have a PS5 like me then of course it is a beautiful Match, forget about the 120 refresh rate and such. This TV at 60 has wayy more quality than some crappy TCL or other brands that state superior perks for a lower price. Quality has a price and Sony makes sure your money has been well paid for. I also wanted to Kudos Amazon cause the TV arrived so quickly after ordering and their price was the lowest among other tech sellers, including the same Sony guys haha",

                "reviewText": "What can I say? It\u2019s a SONY, right?Each new generation of SONYS that we acquire in life\u2019s journeys is a progressive step forward, from the advent of the Trinitron tube to the flat screen wonder of the WEGA, we\u2019ve always appreciated the dramatic steps forward. This flat screen is so dramatically advanced, it\u2019s scary. Now if there were only something decent to view on. The setup was streamlined, especially since we use YOUTUBE TV, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are flawless-no wires except for power. The internal sound is outstanding, but we use Klipsch Nines for our sound system and it\u2019s more than gratifying. The family agrees that the most dramatic viewing of this is with the Radio Paradise app, which runs HD photos relevant to the songs playing. In this context, it is jaw-dropping, and integrated with the Klipsch sound system, offers endless hours of breathtaking music and visuals. The downside to high-definition TV, of course, is clearly seeing all detail, warts and all, you may view your favorite stars quite differently. For them, I\u2019m sure this technology is indeed humbling. At 65 inches, we now eschew the smaller theater venues for better resolution and sound at home. I\u2019m sure that should Hollywood and the rest of the universe actually produce something monumental, played on a HUGE scale or large venue, we\u2019ll still probably go, but it\u2019s a HUGE asset to relax at home. We did hit a few big box stores to look at competitive brands, but SAMSUNG is the only brand who comes close to SONY\u2019s grip on visual quality-they get it. As a HUGE fan of cinema since childhood, it amazes me that just about anyone can afford a very satisfying home theater experience.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Can't change Aspect Ratio, No Screen Mirroring",
                "reviewText": "Update after several months.Absolutely love this set in every way EXCEPT that the aspect ratio can not be adjusted.If you dislike being forced to watch a video in letterbox format with a third of the screen filled with two black stripes above and below the image, you will hate this TV.This SONY does not allow you the option to fill the 16 X 9 screen as other TV's allowI own several Sony TVs because they have been trouble-free with excellent images. This particular set is outstanding. There has been such incredible progress in flat screens.The set arrived well packaged with clear and precise unpacking instructions. It was delivered by two very friendly and helpful Amazon employees who handled it carefully and kept the correct side up.When you attach the legs to the set, be sure to lie the set flat on a table covered with a clean cloth. It's the easiest way and is recommended in the instructions. There is no plastic protective cover over the screen, so don't try to peel it off. Keep the packing material around the screen on until you have the legs on and have placed the TV exactly where you want it. Then remove the protection. This helps to avoid any potential damage to the screen via fingerprints or pressure.The unit almost set itself up once it was turned on.As someone who has Google devices and the Google home app, this TV is an absolute dream. Everything will work via voice commands to the TV or one of your Google devices. Your Google photos can stream on the set when it is in idle mode. Someone who lives in the Apple world would have to comment on how easily the set works with Apple devices.The picture is razor sharp. The built-in sound system is decent with some kind of woofer chambers that route sound similar to a Bose system. It will self-adjust to the acoustics of the room you are in.However, I connected to an existing Sony soundbar and subwoofer with surround sound for a more immersive experience.If you have a sound bar, connect any other devices like a DVD player to the HDMI port on the TV so that everything can be easily controlled versus connecting them to the soundbar. Use an Arc HDMI cord to connect the soundbar to the TV.The unit pulled in 30 broadcast stations clearly with a tiny antenna next to the TV.Make sure that your Wi-Fi connection is sufficient to power this 4K television properly. You should have at least 15 to 20 megabits per second download speed. More is better if you have a home with several devices connected to your Wi-Fi router.Some other things to consider: if you have Netflix, you must upgrade to get 4k content. It's a few dollars more a month and worth it.If you have subscribed to streaming services through the Roku channel, they may not work properly on this TV if you want to access them through the TV itself. You may need a direct subscription to a streaming service like Paramount Plus versus streaming it through the Roku channel. It's not a big deal to change that.We have several ROKU units connected to televisions in our house. ROKU has done a magnificent job of keeping things simple and allowing customization to just see the channels that you want.In the past, accessing streaming content via televisions was sometimes cumbersome and slow. With this particular set, there is no lag time. Connections are incredibly fast. Customization of favorites and what you want to see or don't is very straightforward. Everything is as good and as fast as via a ROKU unit.The 4K picture is so superior to standard HD that you will easily see the difference. Brighter images, darker blacks and color saturation that looks more authentic.What you get for the price paid now is an incredible bargain regardless of the screen size you select. We purchased a Sony HD set with a cathode ray tube many years ago and it cost nearly $3,000. Now you can purchase a far larger screen, with far better definition, more content and a very easy to operate interface for a fraction of that price. What a miracle of human creativity and competition!Lastly, the remote control for this television is a gem. Very few buttons. Very intuitive. Very clean. Voice commands for many things if you want to use them. And best of all, it is an RF remote so you don't have to point it at the TV all the time as with an IR remote. It would work in your pocket.Possible Improvements:User ability to change the aspect ratio is a must. I don't like watching letterbox formats with duplex streaks across the top and bottom of the screen. With this set you are unable to fill your screen with wide screen selections.This set does not come with screen mirroring as Sony TVs having the past. It's a real pain in the neck streaming from an Android phone versus the simplicity of screen mirroring.An earphone jack on the remote like Roku offers so you can listen via headphones and not disturb others if necessary. There's a phone jack on the TV, but who wants to deal with that long cord when listening in private?Overall, fairly well done, SONY.",

All picture modes have visible difference and can be adjusted as per your liking. 10/10 would recommend.",
