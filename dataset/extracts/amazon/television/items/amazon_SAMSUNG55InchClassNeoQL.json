                "reviewText": "Coming from 32\", 720p Samsung LCD from 2007 (which to Samsung's credit was still in perfect working order less one flaky HDMI port and a whining component), any cheap no-name UHD TV coupled with my already 4K capable Roku would have been a significant upgrade in every category except longevity, but I am extremely satisfied I picked this model, which sits at the lower end of Samsung's 2023 NeoQLED TV lineup. For the unacquainted, these are a step below the highest tier OLED panels, but a step up from the regular QLED and even cheaper yet Crystal UHD models you'd see at a big box store (which all still look great, modern TVs are overpowered). The image has a lot more contrast, less glare, and deeper blacks than my roommates 65\" QLED model from a couple years ago.I really only stream these days, don't game, and don't even have a sound bar (I would recommend getting one, as the built in is tinny and doesn't project forward well), so most of the features and gimmicks are lost on me. I just wanted a bigger and sharper panel, and this one is incredible.Overall, I'm glad I went with a Samsung again. The remote is not intuitive whatsoever, the WiFi receiver isn't great, and Smart TV features and UI are a cluttered disaster that I would recommend replacing with a Roku, but to it's credit setup and control interaction with my Galaxy S23 was seamless, and performance of built in apps has been so good (one you get to them) that I haven't reconnected the Roku. Can't speak to Longevity, but Samsung TVs (at least the panels) have historically been rock solid. Build quality and materials on this lineup are incredible, the Smart features can easily be replaced with a newer Roku down the road, so I anticipate this will last a while.",

Expected the TV to be crushed but to my surprise it worked great when they took it out of the box. The TV itself is wonderful. The Neo QNED has a wonderful picture and clean image. Remote is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Reminds me of the older 2015 model remotes which I really liked. TV has a million options for adjustments etc. My PS5 really pops. Almost overwhelming at first. My work has a LG QNED 85 which is a little less in price but this TV in my opinion performs much better. Well worth the money.",

I can't say where this thing was destroyed or when but something was clearly dropped on it. It was not visible at all until we tried to turn it on and saw this flash. It obviously doesn't work. It is heavy and now we have to get it back downstairs and rebox it for pickup. We ended up buying another, someplace else. Hopefully those people will handle it better. If our local big box store had it, I would of just said, heck with it and gone there. Edit: While reboxing it, I found a paper taped to the box from 1-2 months earlier where it had been delivered to someone halfway across the country from us and they refused it. I wonder why. The box looked like it had been bounced around in a truck months. We got our replacement from another source and had absolutely no issues.",
