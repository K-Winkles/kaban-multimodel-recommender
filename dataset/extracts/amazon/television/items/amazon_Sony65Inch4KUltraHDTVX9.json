I love the colors and how flawlessly the PS5 works on it. Also, I am getting more channels with my TV antenna compared to my previous LG or Vizio tvs and they look so good. If my OLED Sony A90J TV was in the return window, I would replaced it for this TV. The OLED colors/resolution/glare is better, obviously, but I don\u2019t think is much difference when you think $3k vs $1k for this TV.Original Review Nov/2023\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..I recently bought a PS5, so I decided to replaced my 70\u201d LG TV with a Sony one. What can I say, you pay for what you get. I have a 55\u2019\u2019 Sony OLED A90J Master Series in my master bedroom, but decided to get an LED since I watch some tv here and there and may leave the tv on for background noise in the living room, so don\u2019t want issues with burning image on an OLED screen. I read/watched many reviews on this X90L and the X93L and liked that this one was good looking and about 20lbs lighter. The TV looks amazing and is well built. I like the stand legs, they are long and sturdy. The picture quality is nice and way better than my previous LG tv. Perfect timing for me to get it on Black Friday early deals, get it while you can. Amazon delivery and set up was great. I didn\u2019t have to do any lifting at all, friendly staff, and they worked quickly. HIGHLY recommend the Amazon delivery to room of choice. I\u2019m not sure about other people reviews regarding cracked screens. I don\u2019t see any issues with my screens. The TV was packed for the gods, so it has to be hit very hard to be cracked or maybe dropped?",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I love this TV!",
                "reviewText": "This is the nicest TV I've ever owned in my 40+ years on this planet. My last TV was a 42\"1080p, which was decent, but this thing is on a whole other level!The picture on this thing is so good! My cable TV only lets me get decent picture, but when I turn on my Xbox Series X and play a 4k game or watch a DVD or downloaded video I get to see what this thing is capable of, and I love it! I don't see any problems with it at all. I'm not a videophile or expert, but when I saw a random comment here and there about a random thing being a small issue with their TV I tried to recreate the same thing and never got anything that would ever remotely qualify as a problem. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough, but to me this TV is pretty much perfect.One of the nicest surprises of the TV is the sound it puts out! I was kind of expecting decent sound because I've seen that some modern TVs (like my last one) have what is essentially like a little mini soundbar built into the bottom of the TV when they're big enough. Since my last 42\" sounded good I hoped this would too. Well I was NOT disappointed! The sound is really clear, and gets more than loud enough for my small living room (20'x30'). I have never turned it up past 40 and I'm pretty sure it goes up to 100. It's not going to shake the house or make your ears bleed since there's no sub woofer or anything, but for a TV I can't help but to be impressed.Actually, not only is there good sound coming from the bottom of the TV, but Sony seems to have done some kind of magic with speakers mounted in the back on the side of the TV up towards the top. These things can throw sound around the room and create a kind of surround sound. I don't know how they do it, because there isn't even a speaker grill or anything back there, the sound just comes through the plastic. I only noticed because I was standing next to it and heard them. It's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.As I sit here typing this I have the TV on and I'm sitting in a menu for Forza Motorsport. The sounds of the menu music really seem like they're coming from the sides, and even behind me a little bit. The sound from this TV really impresses me. More than a few times since I bought it I'll think I hear something outside to my left, but it's just the TV doing it's thing. It's great!One thing to note is that this TV is heavy. I believe the box said 70lbs when it was delivered. I have it mounted on the wall and I needed a friend to help me so I didn't risk breaking anything. So if you see the listed weight on here and think that other TVs are so much lighter and easy to pick up so it must be a typo, it isn't. This thing is so much heavier than I thought it would be.I know there are better TVs out there, but they cost a lot more. I believe Sony pushed the tech in this kind of TV about as far as they can, and in my opinion they did an amazing job. It isn't the latest and greatest, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this TV. If you're on the fence, do it! I think you'll be happy. You've probably done enough research to be where you're wondering if you should pull the trigger. Well I think you should. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm so happy I bought this thing! I'll update if anything changes, but part of the reason I bought this is because Sony is supposed to build TVs that last much longer than others. We'll see. Right now I couldn't be happier.",

                "reviewText": "Caveat Emptor. The TV is wonderful. Great picture with a cinematic experience. HOWEVER...Amazon dropped the price $200 right after I ordered it. I asked about some kind of adjustment. I understand prices go up and down but it was a $200 price drop within the return period. They wanted to have me return the TV and order a replacement! They would come, take it off the wall, ship it back, send a replacement and mount it again (they would absorb the cost). I suggested we do a \"paper return\" where I generate a return, get the credit, order a new one, get the better price and the TV I have stays put. They couldn't do that. I was trained as an economist and my suggestion made sense in terms of saving time, effort (their) money, truck fumes, etc. FRUSTRATING!",

To my pleasant surprise, the delivery from Amazon went well and the box was not damaged in anyway. The setup was straight forward and the Sony picture is great. Very minimal adjustments are needed, mainly the brightness, You should not have issues in a bright room. When it comes to blooming, Sony's algorithms do a good job at controlling it. The blooming won't be like other much more expensive miniled tvs but this tv holds its own considering the price. Happy with this Sony tv purchase. I used some of Rtings calibration settings as a reference.",
