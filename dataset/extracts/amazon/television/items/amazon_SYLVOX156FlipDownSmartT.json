Putting it under 12\" deep cabinet meant we had to have it stick out. The max you can do is 21/2 \" This means that when you swivel the back of the TV hits the walland limits the swivel.We also have had to use our old remote to change channels and the new one for one/off and volume",

As you might imagine I dont all the room a van does. but after custom fitting a full twin bed in the back I dont have much options for a tv. Well this one IS PERFECT! I was able to mount it on the inside roof of my car, and it has been a game changer. how it mounts keeps it nice and tucked in, and having the screen fold down and up is so clutch. Also it swivels! so you can point it in any direction, and the screen when it folds down stays in place so you can fold it to a 90 degree angle or anything in between and it will stay. So with the swivel and the fold down screen you can set it up for perfect viewing no matter what position you are watching. And it is a $400 tv so you will be happy to know the picture quality is fantastic. you get what you pay for. I am beyond greatful this product exists!",
