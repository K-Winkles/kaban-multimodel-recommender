It was packaged much more securely this time. The picture quality is great and the sound was better than expected. Though we\u2019re still going to be using a sound bar. I would say the biggest downside is the wall mount. The plastic anchors feel cheap and break easily so you\u2019ll either need to get different drywall anchors or find the studs to install the mount into.",

                "reviewText": "The TV itself works fine. Nothing fancy. It's a refurbished unit that came with a free mount. It's seamless setup as you would expect by now from TV manufacturers.The mount that was free does not fit the TV. I purchased this \"bundle\" for a small TV option for the kitchen. The mount for the TV will not install due to the included bolts being too big. The hardware that is included with the TV for the legs will not fit as a replacement for the mount hardware (otherwise the included TV legs work fine).If you buy this TV for the TV, and nothing else, easy 4 stars. The wall mount issue deducts a star.",
