                "reviewText": "I got the 24\" model (no DVD) for my cat to use in her private office, which is a small room. She hasn't voiced any specific complaints. I attached it to the wall, but didn't use any wall mount hardware, just 1\" spacers, because I didn't want my cat getting between the TV and the wall. The sound is just okay. I think they could have made the sound better, even considering the size of the cabinet. But it is good enough that I won't add a soundbar. Because the HDMI input is downward facing, I used an angled HDMI extension (amazon B0BC2WFZ1L). If I didn't, the HDMI cable would have been visible and my cat would have been clawing at it. Even tough this TV has native resolution around the size of 720p, it does support 1080p input modes. And various streaming services will send 1080p video. I like that this TV powers up quickly and directly to HDMI input mode, without any long smart tv boot process, screens, or menus.",

This is because I am planning to use his TV only temporarily For guests when they are staying with me.The TV works fine, and included. Remote control works as it should. The TV volume goes up plenty high, and the TV is very light weight making it very easy to set just about anywhere.Overall, I am very pleased with this TV, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive television option. There are plenty of HDMI inputs on the back of the TV, so connecting computers, or DVD players, or satellite systems and cable via HDMI is not a problem at all.",

                "reviewText": "We needed an extra television to put in a spare bedroom for teenagers on weekends. This is good enough for them to see what they want and to hook up their games to. The picture is basically good. Space is also an issue as there are so many beds in there it looks like a mafia movie from the 80s.It works, has good color, and not too much sound to hear in the next room across the hallway, behind closed doors. Crucial. (No, we did not put a sound bar in there. LOL. So inconsiderate.)",

                "reviewText": "I put this TV through its paces with various kinds of program material, viewing distances, etc. I have to say, I like it! The picture looked really sharp and clear to me. The setup was easy. The manual is complete and is written in ordinary English (not always the case).I found that the audio from the TV is average at best and does not, in my view, match the quality of the picture. This is not really the fault of the manufacturer; there is just no way to build two full-range, high-fidelity speaker systems into a cabinet with this form factor. My solution was to use the provided earphone jack to send the audio to a pair of powered computer speakers. Problem solved!The two HDMI input connectors are on a surface that would be difficult to get to once the TV is in use. However, there is rarely a need to plug or unplug the input cables in daily use, so this is not really a problem.I rate this TV as a good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "After my eldest moved out and took his TV, we turned his room into a guest room. I really wanted a decent TV to put back in there and this one was a perfect choice.The resolution is not perfect, but it's really decent for the size and price of this TV. The sound quality is surprisingly great, even without a sound system added. It's easy to set up, plug and play without having to struggle with complex wiring.I really like this addition and am happy with this TV. The size is perfect and it was easy to mount. This is not a smart TV, but we had an extra firestick that we plugged into it using one of several ports available.Great price for the quality.",
