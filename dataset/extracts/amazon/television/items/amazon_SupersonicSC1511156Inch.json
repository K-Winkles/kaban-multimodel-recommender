The TV speakers are very small and the sound comes out of the bottom of the TV. The sound quality is tinny not much bass but, I expected this when I bought the TV. The remote control only works with the TV and the Fire remote does not work for TV controls. Overall I am very please with this unit.",

                "reviewText": "This is not a high quality television. Period. However, it works for the small space on my kitchen counter. I would have to agree with so many of the reviews that describe the sound as \"tinny\" yet at the same time, it IS audible and I can live with it. I would agree with yet another review that described the picture as sharp with good color rendition WHEN LOOKING STRAIGHT ON. The picture quality changes depending on one's viewing angle. It will lighten/wash out OR darken as I walk around the kitchen doing tasks. If I stay in one general area and adjust the screen appropriately, it is just fine. A small inconvenience to me is that I am not able to press/hold the up or down arrows on the remote to adjust the volume. Instead, I have to repeatedly click the arrow as it adjusts one digit at a time. I prefer holding the button down while the volume increases or decreases automatically (and much more quickly). Again, something I can live with but certainly not what I'm used to with other remote controls. Bottom line, I will use this television until I find something better. (I am not actively looking.) But for the reasonable price, it will be pretty easy to replace one day without feeling guilty.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Let's get real: It is a fine little TV",
                "reviewText": "This is a fine little TV. Five stars for the quality of the TV, recognizing it for what it is (and not expecting it to compete with larger and more expensive sets). I got the black model, for a small TV near my work desk in my study. The unit is attractive, clean, and it fits in nicely in my decor. Picture quality is excellent, sound is great. It is true (as some reviewers have said) that picture quality falls off as you move away from center in front of the screen; that is normal and to be expected with any LED TV this size and at this price point. The picture is still clear and easy to view from normal viewing angles in front of the TV. It is also true that the speakers are small and attached to a small TV, so you're not going to get huge volume, depth of sound field, or base response. Sound fidelity is still great and the volume is plenty if you are sitting at a distance where you can reasonably see the screen. (I sit three to five feet from the screen, within about a five foot square area roughly but not always exactly in front of it.) Sound does tend to get tinny if you turn it all the way up. (I tried, just to test it; the volume gets very loud but sound quality quickly falls off if you get it near top volume. Sitting at four~ish feet away, I find that mine is normally less than 1/4 of full volume.) After just a few days, I've not yet seen any bad pixels or had to attempt support, so I can't comment yet on those aspects or on how long or well it will last. So, in sum: This great little unit is only 13.3 inches and costs less than $100. So let's get real: This is a great TV in this class and at this price point. This is NOT your living room home entertainment system; it is a small and inexpensive TV for small spaces.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1) Very light weight. Nice weight for mounting in an RV.2) Nice picture. It's very clear and adequately bright.3) AC/DC and functions on12V DC in the RV after you buy a DC cord.Cons:1) The worst sound quality I have ever experienced. My cell phone speaker is much louder. If your RV has the A/C running, or the microwave running, or there are kids playing outside of your RV, or it's raining, you will not be able to hear your TV, even at 100% volume. My hearing is stellar. This TVs audio is shockingly poor. This is truly the quietest TV I have ever seen. It's maybe 1/10th as loud as all other TVs I own.2) The DC cord is not included and must be purchased separately. AC/DC but no DC cord included?3) The AC cord is hardwired. AC/DC but the electrical AC/DC inputs are separate locations on the TV. The AC cord cannot be removed, so must be coiled up and stored behind the TV if running on DC.4) Leg mounting screws are included, but wall mounting screws are not included. 4 M4x10 if memory serves. $10.00 in gas and a trip to the hardware store for 4 mounting screws. (leg mounting screws and wall mounting screws should be the same as you are either mounting on the legs or mounting on a Wall. I guess my thinking is too simple)I'm disappointed and would not recommend this TV. It can run on 12V DC but was primarily designed to run on 120 AC. The poor audio is truly it's downfall. If I keep it, I'll have to run wires to the RV stereo for sound.",
