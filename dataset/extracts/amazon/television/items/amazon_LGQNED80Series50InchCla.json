                "reviewText": "After over a decade with Samsung TV\u2019s, I\u2019mGlad I made the switch. I replaced a ~10yo Samsung 65\u2019 with this (its smart feature has not been supported for years.This 75\u2019 fits my wall width perfectly. It\u2019s not too big. We don\u2019t think our eyes are jumping fromleft to right to take it all in. I like how easily accessible the settings that I normally need to access are. I paired it with an LG soundbar, which I think it needed for regular tv watching, and two Apple HomePods when using my Apple TV.Love the brightest theme; being able to switch to the dimmer settings late at night.I don\u2019t care how \u201cblack the blacks are\u201d, so they look fine to me. I understand that this isn\u2019t an OLED tv, so I didn\u2019t compare. However, I had to tweak the settings because I found it hard to watch dark scenes on movies. I just watched a couple of YouTube videos for best settings recommendations.The price was just right for me. I don\u2019t like spending a lot of money on TVs and I take really good care of mine. Hence, the reason my previous one lasted over 10 years.We had the TV professionally installed so that the wires were behind the wall. I installed Govee lights behind the TV. The type that have a camera & movie theater theme the changes the colors based on what\u2019s on the screen.We\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on the TV when people see it.4K quality viewing options look amazing on this. Non-4K viewing options clearly reveals pixels which does slightly annoy me because I\u2019m used to 4k quality on the Apple TV.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a very large HDTV. Check. I didn't want to go OLED as I had several plasmas and remember ghost images that were hard to go away due to \"slight\" burn-in. Check. I had read enough about the new very small nano LCD apertures to believe until individually addressable micro led direct view sets become affordable, LG QNED, and Samsung's similar Quantum Dot panels are the way to go. Check. I wanted brightness without crushing dark black Check. I wanted local dimming with the newer mini-led backlight technology. Check.So, I took a chance and bought this set sight unseen. I didn't make a mistake I'm happy to say. This set can work in a well lit or dark room no problem. It can make levels of black look black, and with detail so no crushing. It has almost non-existent bloom across the entire screen when displaying white letters on black background for instance. It has a modern set of specs like compatible with HDR-10/Dolby Vision. There are a few things I'm thinking are not great, but certainly not deal-breaking stuff. Things like the remote is impossible to use in a dark space (and in my case without reading glasses). The sound isn't cutting edge stuff like the Sony sets that radiate a bigger and more wide-range soundstage using the entire front of the screen...although sound is adequate for now while I'm waiting to see if I can get the new Nakamichi Dragon surround set. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this TV and I'm writing this only a few weeks after paying about $500 more than the currently offered price. The TV is good enough this doesn't even cause me a case of sour grapes, though if I could I'd return it and order it again which I can't cause I threw away the box and packing materials. But make no mistake, I'd definitely buy it again. I have had several LG HDTV's beginning with their somewhat unusual (the only one ever on the market to my knowledge) rear projected 9\" CRT tube first ever HDTV then marketed under the Zenith name (a premium name they owned then). It had a great picture but developed problems with showing 720P (progressive inputs) and after repairing it twice they actually offered, and did, buy it back at over $4.5K. Now that's a stand-up company that cares about what they make and the consumer that shells out hard earned dough for their products. I recommend LG HDTV's now as well!",

                "reviewText": "Had a brief hiccup involving a broken Optical Digital Audio port that came that way out of the box. But a quick replacement was sent within 48 hours. It's been TV viewing heaven ever since.It's very bright without being overpowering. It has AI picture setup and that allowed me to get the ideal picture for me. That's good because it doesn't involve constant tweaking of the picture. For me it was, quite literally, a \"set-it-and-forget-it\" type deal.The apps that come with it are decent to pretty good. The TV audio is decent, but I run the audio via the Optical Digital port to an old LG branded 5.1 home theater system and it sounds excellent! I do plan on upgrading to a sound bar in the not too distant future though.The Magic Remote is just pure awesomeness! Interesting note: my previous LG TV from 2015 did not come with an actual Magic Remote just the circuitry. I could use my phone as one on that TV. \ud83e\udd14I'm loving this TV. I just hope this \"love affair\" doesn't end any time soon.",
