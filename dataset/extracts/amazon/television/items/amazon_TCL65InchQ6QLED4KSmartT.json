                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a 10 year old 60\" Sharp 1080p that had a great picture but did not have smart features. I wasn't sure the picture would be an upgrade, but I was tired of having to switch between the firestick for smart features and the tv remote for antenna and HDMI functions.This did not disappoint. The footprint of this 65\" is not much bigger than the old 60\" because of the edge to edge picture. The sound is much better as well, I had to use a soundbar with the sharp because of the thin sounding speakers. The picture is outstanding, I'm just using the factory settings-mainly standard but occasionally switching to Movie and Dynamic. I haven't set any Custom pictures up yet, but will in the future. It's lighter as well and I was able to use the same slim mount as my older tv. Lighter is definitely more manageable. The power and inputs are easy enough to access even with it being mounted close to the wall.This is really a great tv with a ton of features for the money-It's quite a bit cheaper than what I paid for the smaller 60\" tv 10 years ago--not many things are better and cheaper than they were 10 years ago.",
