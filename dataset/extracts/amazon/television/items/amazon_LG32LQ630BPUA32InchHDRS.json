                "reviewText": "Not at all what I expected. The remote control is not at all user friendly. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone. The reason I ordered this smaller tv, was because I thought it would have the same features as my 55\". It does not. I wanted to be able to connect my VCR, and DVR up, and it does not have the ports in back of the TV. Also the remote control, is not user friendly at all. It's supposed to have the wheel in the center of the remote where I can roll it and the arrow will appear on the TV. It does not. Which makes programming this TV a nightmare. Also, I was expecting it to be delivered, but someone to come set it up for me, like my larger they did with my larger tv. I chose a Saturday date, so I could be home. Instead the tv was left out side my house, in the rain. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!",
