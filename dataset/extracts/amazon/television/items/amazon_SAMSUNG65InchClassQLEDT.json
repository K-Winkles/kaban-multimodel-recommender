Looks fabulous as art (no need to pay for their subscription, if you can download it off the internet, you can upload it onto the tv). There is no reflection or glare.Works great as a TV as well. Sound and picture quality are great in my opinion.Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I love these TVs. This is my 4th art tv. The newer models include a remote without a charging cable but has solar charging capabilities. I think it\u2019s ridiculous that Samsung doesn\u2019t include the charging cable for the remote being that these TVs are quite expensive. It would be a non- issue if the solar charging panel actually worked. After 4 months, both remotes are dead despite ample time in sunlight to recharge, reset tv, de-pairing and re-pairing remotes to still be faulty. Quite annoying to be ordering a $10 charging cable that should have been included so I can try to resolve this POS remote issue. Also ordered a replacement remote in the event the original POS remote still doesn\u2019t work. Just send a charging cable and save everything the frustration!!",
