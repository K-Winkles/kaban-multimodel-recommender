I also had a 55\" TCL go kaput after just 2 years. I doubt they've done long term tests on the TCL big screens as the reviews have been glowing, but my experience says steer clear.If you're in the market for a reasonably price big screen tv for your living room then look no further as this is a great tv for your average person. This might not be a serious gamer or videophile set but the picture pops and to me the contrast is great which is important.These are the pros that were important to me:Pros:Beautiful picture especially in higher resolutionDeeper blacksMinimalist remote that works with my Vizio soundbarOptical to work with my older soundbarNice design with very thin bezelRechargeable remote(USB C) with solar recharging also! No batteries to change!Pleasing interface, easy to navigateSamsung product. I've always had good luck with their tv's though I did buy the Asurion insurance just in case.Sale price was reasonableCons:I had an issue with VESA bolt holes when mounting but I got 'er done.I'll update if I have any issues.",

Granted the picture is not quite as good as high end Qled TV\u2019s or OLED TV\u2019s which are far more expensive, but for the price it is very good. The only minor downside is the small & confusing remote but for about $10 a full size remote can be purchased here on Amazon.",

It has a lot of good features, the picture quality is great, the colors, brightness, sharpness are all things to be desired. Where this tv falls off a bit for me is the interface, it just looks cheap. Setting up all the apps can be really annoying aswell. Ive also had a few issues with random turn offs, or certain apps always having an issue, like netflix, and history channel. I was able to get this tv for such a good deal around black friday so for the value its a great tv. I just dont love the samsung software. All that said, its a solid tv for the price. Picture quality is the most important feature to me so im happy with the tv overall.",

Once you figure it out, it's fine though. The solar power recharge feature is a nice touch. Overall I'm quite happy with this as a gaming teleivision. The movies I've tested on 4K Blu Ray look superb too.",

                "reviewText": "Samsung 85\u201d TV review. Here\u2019s how it went. First the packing is pitifully flimsy. One of the 4 plastic snaps that hold the ends of the cardboard box was pre-broken, thankfully the other 3 held. The segmented Styrofoam elements formed a chain around only the perimeter of the carton but provided no flex prevention to the carton. Little diagrams stamped along the bottom depicting opening procedures convened nothing instructive but we managed to carefully open the box. Once opened it was about the same size and the Sony 85\u201d it was replacing. Good so far. The single double sides page of instructions were very colorful with tons of arrows, but may have equally been useful for launching jets off an aircraft carrier or construction a bridge beam girder. Only one single item was useful: mounting to a wall bracket requires 4 M8 bolts which were NOT included. Really Samsung? A dimes worth of bolts you can\u2019t provide on a $2K tv? Strike one.Now all connected and plugged in we reach for the remote to turn on the new tv. The remote is charged not by batteries but a solar window on the back or by USB port, the cable for that was also NOT provided. Luckily I had one that worked and charged the remote enough to begin. Strike two.The tv came on in glorious super bright color! I'm talking lighthouse bright. No problem, I\u2019ll tone down the output with settings. But first what\u2019s with the 2\u201d wide band of tiny vertical lines just off the right edge of the screen? Or the 1\u201d band of squiggly bars of colored lines racing across the very bottom of the screen? No amount of scrolling thru endless steps of the limited buttons on the remote would remove or provide any insight of the errant lines on the screen. Strike 3.A call to customer service was next. I won\u2019t describe the events between dialing the number and finally talking to a person (in India? Pakistan? The Caribbean?) who was very nice and requested a photo of the lines on the screen, texted to a particular number, which I did. No response. We have spent almost 2 hours now and obviously this unit is faulted. Frustration and disappointment fill the room. Back to Amazon it goes. Having spent thousand of dollars on Amazon over the years, this is my first return, and I discover the return process will take up to 37 days to refund my $2200. Lesson learned: no more big expenditures with Amazon.I have been a fan of Sony television since the Trinitron days. For the past 45 years, every TV I bought for myself or bought for my kids or gifted- was a Sony, including the last one: an 85 incher. Loved it. Then one day it wouldn\u2019t come on. Died after 19 months. NINETEEN MONTHS for a $2300 TV? Disappointed beyond words. But I\u2019m fortunate to have a helpful son (who favors Samsung) and just happens to know everything and rather than go another 10 rounds with him over which TV is best I just bought an 85\u201d Samsung. This was a mistake. Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe the overworked handlers of Amazon weren\u2019t as careful as they could have been, given the inadequate packaging. Possibly some disreputable seller unloaded some questionable name brand components to Amazon, who knows. But over all I prefer the Sony picture, remote and necessary devices included over the Samsung.
