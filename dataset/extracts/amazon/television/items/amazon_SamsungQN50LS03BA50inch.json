It actually looks like a portrait. The picture quality is great. There was initially a sound delay but it may have been a streaming service we used because it seems to be improved. Have only had this for 2 weeks and we are still getting used to the features and deciding whether we want to use a sound bar.",

                "reviewText": "Over all I like the tv. The picture is great on it and the art mode is exactly what I wanted so it didn\u2019t just look like a tv above my fire place. However I should have done a better job with reading up on it. For one it does not just plug into the wall it has an external box that it has to plug into which is quite big. I had a plug put in the fire place for plugging in a tv but once I got it I realized that was not going to happen. I was considering sending it back because the whole point of the tv was to look like a picture and wires going around the wall was not going to do it. Fortunately my husband and I figured out how to run it behind the stone from one plug to another. Definitely keep that in mind if you are going to put it on the wall and don\u2019t want to see wire. Also this one didn\u2019t come with a frame which I was aware of when I bought it but dang those things are expensive. I definitely feel like it needs one for the full affect so I will be buying one soon. Just some things to keep in mind before purchasing.",
