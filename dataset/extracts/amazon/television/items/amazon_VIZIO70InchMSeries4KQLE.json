Even with the AppleTV, sometimes the TV gets hung up on powering on? Maybe I am just impatient.The picture quality really leaves much to be desired. I know you get what you pay for... But I got a comparable 75\" Vizio TV from a family member a couple years ago (my cat killed the thing) and I felt the colors were a bit more vibrant and the exposure was not so gnarly. But now that I am thinking about it -- maybe I just have to tweak. But I am usually on my AppleTV and it auto switches to \"4K HDR\" when using netflix and half my shows are pixelated on highspeed internet.Beats me.I TRIED gaming on here -- but I am so used to playing on my PC... Big screens are just not my thing for gaming. I will say this: PS4 (slim) had some input lag. Very minute but noticeable for me. If you are not playing competitively and are just vibing, go for it.The antiglare face is nice. The controller is OK. The build is actually nice in my opinion. A nice and heavy TV. I am familiar with Vizio -- so UI is no issue or anything to write home about for me.It is a budget friendly monster sized TV.",

                "reviewText": "I got to say I love this TV it's looks nice and sounds nice with the vizio 5.1 surround sound speakers. It was well worth it. If your looking for a 4k TV with a great picture this is the TV for you. The only complaint I have is my TV was shipped by a 3rd party company NSD and they took forever to ship it the box was damaged and there is a crack on the back. The TV works fine and I haven't had any issues so far but Amazon needs to part ways from that 3rd party company. They are hard to contact and never give a clear insight on where your TV is located. That is my only complaint.The TV is great the picture quality is great. My son even games on it with the base model ps4 and the picture even looks better. I haven't hooked my ps5 up to it yet but I bet the picture is just as great if not better.Conclusion:NSD Shipping sucks!!! 0 StarsGaming 5 starsPicture Quality 5 StarsSound (Unable to give valid answer due to having sound bar I would just suggest getting a sound bar)",

                "reviewText": "Pros:* Excellent Picture* Many features* Excellent Connectivity* Many improvements from online firmware upgrades over two years* Remote simple and effectiveNeutral:* The smart TV OS is Vizio's \"house brand\", generally not as good as Google or Roku and also a limited selection of apps. Will meet most user's needs (no Crunchyroll though) and is rather slow but usable.Bad:* Picture died in 23 months. TV used about 6 hrs a day on average, no warning, just sudden death. Picture went out, leaving small white bar on top of screen. After hard reboots, eventually large bluish white blobs would appear on screen, and we could still get sound, but nothing like an actual picture.* TV has one year warranty, obviously a bit too short!Bottom Line: Review sites love Vizios as their higher end models offer excellent picture quality and many features at much lower prices than Samsung or LG. Well and good, but the review site tests these things for maybe a month or two, and so don't evaluate long term reliability.Consumer Reports says 1 in 5 Vizios have a major problem within 5 years of purchase. If you don't want to spend twice the price on a Samsung or LG, be sure to add an extended warranty if you want to buy a Vizio (or TCL or Hisense). Amazon's Asurion is cheaper than Best Buy's extended warranties, but is more likely to offer replacement cost than repair, which may suit most buyers nicely.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoy my smart home setup and having devices that work with Alexa, and the fact that this TV says it works with Alexa was a major factor in my purchase. And while the specs say it works with Alexa, that's not quite true.First off, the instructions that Vizio provides on connecting the TV to Alexa are not correct. In one of the steps you need to register on the Vizio website, but the page that you link to on the Vizio website does not fully load and you cannot register. Instead, I had to download the Vizio SmartCast app and use that to connext. Then you have to set up the Alexa skill within the Alexa app. Go ahead and read the review on that skill - thousands of negative comments and it's rated less than two stars.I finally got it to partially work. It would turn on and off the TV and open apps, but it could not find anything or control my soundbar volume. I contacted Vizio and they seem confused that their TV was having problems with Alexa, despite the thousands of negative comments. None of their fixes work, and neither did other fixes that I found. Then suddenly, Alexa tells me the TV could not be found and none of the commands worked. I spent 20 minutes connecting the apps, skill, and TV over and over and then got the limited functionality back. 20 minutes later it all stopped working again, despite all of the software being current.Amazon should de-list this product as being Alexa compatible. It's a joke.As for the TV, for the $750 or so I paid for the 70\" model it's great, but it's not exactly plug and play. You have to register the TV and download a ton of updates before you can do anything. That took 30 minutes or so. Once I was able to watch the TV, I was not happy with the picture quality and there was a lot of motion blur. But after 20 minutes or so adjusting the settings I'm more than happy with the picture quality, especially for this price. For those that aren't sure on how to tweak the settings, there are a lot of websites out there that can provide you settings.As a TV it's great. As a smart home device with Alexa it's a failure. Vizio needs to get their act together. From what I found out, this issue has been going on for a long time.",
