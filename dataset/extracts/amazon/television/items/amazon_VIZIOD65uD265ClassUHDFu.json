Having only recently switched to 4k, this was a major improvement!It\u2019s also the largest TV I\u2019ve owned, so the 65 inches were a nice bump for me, bringing out even more of the UHD details.This model also had lots of options for very precisely calibrating and fine-tuning the display specifically to your liking\u2014 great for AV geeks!Once you start spending $1000 or more, it would be nice to have the HDR technology included. This TV did not have that, but still had a very beautiful image.General Design:Design-wise, the TV looks great. Very thin, of course. The main challenge I had with this TV was that it had difficulty recognizing my universal remote\u2019s commands. I have a programmable Harmony Universal remote that worked fine with 5 other TVs, but for some reason, when I attempted to switch inputs to use another device, the TV had difficulty switching; more often than not, it would fail to switch to the correct input. Very annoying!Smart Features:The smart apps were great, and make for an easy way to quickly test out your 4k immediately after set up. One annoyance: if you attempt to switch to another input from the SmartHub\u2019s Netflix app, it won\u2019t let you switch until you answer \u201cDo you want to exit Netflix?\u201d This ended up being a huge nuisance.Audio:I didn\u2019t bother testing the speakers very much. I knew the audio quality for an affordable TV was not going to be amazing. My belief is that if you\u2019re purchasing a large TV, you should have a decent sound system (I recommend a VIZIO sound bar), and not expect the TV to give you an amazing audio experience.PROs:- Excellent all-around image quality.- Very affordable for being 65\u201d!- Decent SmartHub with Amazon, Netflix, etcCONS:- No HDR- Has difficulty responding to certain Universal Remote commandsBottom line: Great size, great image, great bang for your buck.",

I\u2019ve had to do he recommended IT trick of turning it off, unplugging it, holding the power button for 15 seconds, plugging it back in, and turning it on again about a dozen times since I bought it ten months ago. Other than that, I frickin love this TV!Not only was this on sale for $600 when I bought it, it\u2019s worth at least $1000. Great picture quality, great features, and you get Pluto TV (WatchFree) already on the TV. I now watch the Fail Army channel when I can\u2019t find anything on Netflix or Hulu.I also like that our guests can cast to the TV too. We used to have a ChromeCast (which has since died) and it would malfunction all the time. We now use our Vizio and Apple TV (for the older TV) and nothing else. I would definitely buy another Vizio when we need to replace the older TV.",

Interface is a bit barebones, but don't forget this is a value brand.My only issue is it is not fully SMART tv as it only has a limited selection of available apps. In my case it was impossible to install ETV NET - something like Netflix but for Eastern europe.Was going to return it but found an easy brilliant solution - Roku streaming stick for $49.99 (this is a media streamer, Google it). Roku turned this TV into a very smart one. In fact, I would even doubt whether you need to pay premium for Smart Tv - just get a decent TV and spend $50 for a streaming stick - no smart TV can ever match it's functionality anyway.Another issue was with legs spacing - too wide for my existing stand (not Vizio or Amazon's fault). Solution was an aftermarket stand for $53. There are plenty of these universally compatible stands. It's the same concept as a wall mount plate, but instead of the mounting bracket it has legs to stand on.Good job VIZIO!",

They have a wide span with the weight resting on the farthest most tips on each end of the legs. We have a curved/decorative fireplace mantle and unfortunately after centering the TV, the legs don't rest on the part of the mantle that bulges out so I had to add a temporary piece of wood for the TV to rest on. Would have preferred a center mount goose-neck stand. We'll keep the TV but now have to spring for a sturdy wall-mount stand. Picture quality seemed a bit dim and under-whelming, but that was solved when putting TV screen preset to \"Vivid\" mode. Much better for our lighting. Overall, besides the quarks mentioned I'd have give this 4-4.5 stars. For the price, good value. OH and remote is a bit sensitive and must be pointed at the right angle to catch the TV or it won't work.",

                "reviewText": "So I've been using this since black Friday 2016 as my main computer monitor.I couldn't be happier! It's simply amazing! I got this to replace my Samsung 1080P 65\" monitor and the difference is night and day. This was also half the price! The whites are BRIGHT WHITE and the blacks are PITCH black - the Windows 10 black start bar for instance.. I can't tell where the screen's black bezel starts because it's the same shade of pitch black!Of course there are better tv's out there, the local dimming in this TV is excellent for only being 16 zones, but you would certainly want a much higher dimming zone count for those true movie buffs. As a computer monitor, I couldn't be happier!***Jan 31 2017Still performing incredibly well! There have been three times I've turned on the TV and it said, \"Your firmware has been updated\" and that was pretty cool and done through wifi I assume.The only issue I've had with the monitor in the 1200 hours of use so far was when I would enter PICTURE SETTINGS and change them I would get strange HDMI handshake signal loss issues, but that was resolved with the first firmware update that happened.This screen is just unbelieable as a computer monitor! As a TV it's COMPLETELY fine it's a bloody tv for crying outloud, most people don't sit close like I do for computer use. Using a 4K TV as a monitor presents an easy to fix issue in Windows as well, EVERYTHING IS TINY! So you just go to your desktop settings and slide the bar that says, \"Change the size of text, apps, and other items: XXX%\" to whatever you like and the text on webpages and the start menu and other programs all displays \"normal\" size but you still get that 4K clarity on everything else. The text on this screen looks as good as my LG G5 screen SO crisp!Enough of this though - GET THIS SCREEN if you are wondering if 4K is for you!",

Hockey games looked buttery smooth and movies are a visual treat!!If you are looking for a big TV on a budget, look no further. Don't be swayed by some of these negative reviews you see on here, this is a great TV.... it's not a $4000 TV though, so it should not be compared to the likes of Samsung.The two biggest complaints about this TV are the audio and the viewing angles. Yes audio could be better, but can be quickly solved with a soundbar... and really it's not nearly as bad as some are making it out to be. I'm an audiophile and I don't find it bad at all. The viewing angles are fairly narrow.... but to put it into perspective, they aren't going to be any worse than the HDTV you bought 8 years ago.... I saw it side by side with a Sanyo and an LG and while the LG had much better angles, the Vizio topped the Sanyo. Small price to pay for this bang for buck TV.If you're in the market, you should consider this one. You won't be dissapointed.",

I will say that I have noticed that some older movies that were shot on film (in SD or HD quality) have a weird feel to, there's a sensation that character/camera movement in terms of speed just doesn't feel right. But as I haven't seen a lot of other 4k TV's I can't say if it's something specific to this one or if it's a problem with all 4k's.I will say that while I love having the Netflix button right there...there is naturally an issue that arises with having button to specific streaming services (instead of just making it programmable), it's that if they go out of business as it happens, the button becomes useless. Like the XUMO button that does the same thing as the Vizio logo button, and iHeart Radio button that brings up a message telling you that it's not available in Canada.Additionally it would be really nice if any of the two wireless keyboard/remote's (with dongles) I have would work because typing letter by letter with vizio's remote is a pain in the ass. But apparently it doesn't automatically detect them and I'm not sure if there's a way to install them.Anyways great TV",
