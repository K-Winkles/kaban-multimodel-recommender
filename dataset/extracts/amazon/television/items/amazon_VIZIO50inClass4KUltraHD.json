While this TV isn't perfect, the picture quality is amazing. I despise smart TVs, so I have a 4K FireStick and a Chromecast Ultra connected to it, both with wired ethernet. I went ahead and bought a Vizio sound bar to go with it, and am now able to enjoy any/all content I want with either the FireStick's interface or using an app on my phone for the Chromecast. Yes, I know the TV is cast enabled and has streaming apps. Again, I despise smart TVs. I tested the functionality of the TVs smart features, and was expectedly underwhelmed. This is not Vizio's fault. I hated Smart TVs going in. I have since disabled the TVs network connection, and rely solely on my FireStick's remote to control everything. I could not be happier.",

Shortly after the 90 day warranty period, the TV started acting up, not showing any content that had motion. It would just show still shots. So no regular TV. No steaming videos. I contacted support and instead of trying to offer any help or suggestions, they told me my purchase was out of warranty and offered no help other than \u201ccall Vizio\u201d.I should have bought a warranty with this. That\u2019s on me.But I would not buy from this company ever again. They obviously do not stand behind their products, and they do not care to help customers when there is an issue. The latter is something that is generally expected these days.",

I love the clarity and quality of the picture and I enjoy popping Netflix up without fussing with my consoles when I don't feel like it. The only caveat I have is sometimes when I'm watching Netflix the blacks get a little too dark and wash out some of the clarity but never when I'm gaming but that might simply be a setting on the TV or the quality of the image streaming from Netflix. Overall I love this TV and I'm super satisfied with it.",

I hate TV's with open legs like that at the very ends . Rendered my stand completely useless and had to put it at toddler flood level fishing kids smashing it \ud83d\ude2d. So we rigged it up hopefully incab get some sort of wall mount or corner mount It's been so long since I bought a TV I didn't even think to check the measurements on the legs of the TV because all the TVs I vowed the stand is in the middle of the TV not on each edge So yeah I had to deconstruct my entertainment stand and we're trying to figure out a way to get it up higher off the ground so the kids don't break it as much money as I paid for it you think I would get a free wall mount",

                "reviewText": "This TV is the absolute bane of my existence. It rarely turns on the first time I hit power. By rarely I mean like 1 time out of every 15. The other times is a guessing game of various techniques to finesse the TV to turn on. Once it is on it tends to work just fine. Except every so often the picture inverts to the negative and then I need to reboot the TV. Then I have to figure out how to get the TV to turn back on again. I have tried unplugging all the HDMIs and then powering on, I have to unplug hold for 10 seconds and then plug back in, switch between the power and the input buttons on the back of the TV, and so on. I have had good experiences with Vizio in the past, but this specific one is a piece of trash and not remotely worth the effort.",
