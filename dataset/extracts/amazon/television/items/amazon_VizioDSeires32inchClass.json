I read the reviews after ordering and saw a lot of bad ones so I was kind of dreading the hassle of inevitability returning this... it showed up yesterday, and I couldn\u2019t get it to connect to WiFi so I couldn\u2019t set it up. I tried all the tricks in the book, read a million blogs and watched a million YouTube videos. I spent hours banging my head against the wall for spending so much on a tv that didn\u2019t work. WELL. I woke up this morning and it was magically connected to my WiFi! Signing into Hulu, Netflix, Disney plus etc was a breeze. The remote app is also pretty awesome. Plus it comes with a bunch of free channels, which is dope because I\u2019ve never had cable before. My babies are happily watching some kids show on qubo. I\u2019m thrilled. 10/10 would purchase again",

I\u2019ve changed the batteries in the remote (thinking that was the issue) but the issues persist. It glitches whenever watching Disney+ and doesn\u2019t have an HBO max app in addition to the other issues outlined below.Today, three times it turned off by itself in the middle of watching something on Hulu stating there is an input issue. This is not the first time.The tv often stops working and turns itself off, Freezes and glitches.There is a significant lag when buttons are pressed (again I eliminated the idea it could be the remote several times).I hard reset (unplug and wait) several times a week.I do not have this issue with my other vizio tv that I\u2019ve had for over 10 years.Funny enough, this tv works *BETTER* when I plug in a fire stick. What is the point in buying a smart tv if a fire stick works better?I contacted the seller and they said that I should change the batteries in my remote (which I\u2019ve done several times). It is clear this is defective in some way and now I may need to buy a new tv which I can\u2019t afford in a pandemic.",

I don\u2019t tho maybe it was updating its self, but even still I almost thought smart cast wasn\u2019t gonna work and would\u2019ve had to send it back. I bought it because it\u2019s a smart tv. Now that everything has loaded properly it works great. I love the extra features that it comes with.",
