Problem is, the things does not work with my Xbox Series X.I hooked up everything and first, it is stuck on a yellow color. Ok. Press the sync button on the side...nothing happens. Press sync in the app...it briefly says syncing and then stops. Grrrrr.I think, ok, maybe it needs a video playing for the initial sync. Open Youtube and play a nice color demo. Same thing...nothing.Netflix...ok, here we go, it is work.Cyberpunk...works, but the screen goes black every 10 seconds.It is unusable. Which is really annoying because returning it from South Africa is a pretty hard no.Spend your money on one of the more expensive ones.",

                "reviewText": "The COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights Kit is an easy way to get amazing, adaptive bias lighting for your TV. Immersion backlights are a new and improved take on an old concept, TV bias lighting. TV bias lighting has been around for years and is a fairly simple concept that helps improve contrast and relieve eye strain. Without getting into the science of it, just know that it improves your viewing experience, especially in a dark room. Bias lighting used to (and still is) done with strips of LED lights on the backside of your TV.The COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights Kit uses an HDMI 2.0 sync box to match the colors on the screen. The other way is to use a camera that is positioned at the top of the TV and sticks out several inches in order to see the whole screen. There are pros and cons to both. I have both types; I have a camera type on my living room 4k TV and the COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlight on my bedroom 4k TV.Since the COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights kit uses the HDMI sync box, that means that it can only be used with a single source i.e., cable box, Fire TV stick, Blu-ray player, etc., unless you are using a receiver as well and connecting all your sources to the receiver and running a single HDMI to your TV. We do not watch a lot of TV in the bedroom and when we do it is always using a 4k Fire TV stick (https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X/), so having a single source makes the COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights Kit perfect for us!The COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights Kit does a phenomenal job! The installation was easy and straightforward, and it comes with great instructions. Just make sure you clean off the back of your TV, so you have a nice and clean surface to stick the LED strip. It consists of (4) individual led strips connected by small cables. It comes with small clips to help secure the cables out if the way as well. For this kit, make sure your TV is at least a 55\u201d or you will need to get a little creative as the LED strips will be a little too long and you will need to bunch it up a little in the middle of each strip. It is the perfect size for 55\u201d to 65\u201d TV.There are (2) small boxes that get stuck to the back of your TV as well and they are connected by a short cable. Once everything is installed and hooked up, you need to download an app which will allow you to adjust and change settings and modes. The whole process was easy and didn\u2019t take very long at all. The results are amazing. There is no lag between the image on the screen and the lights and the light is nice and bright (you can adjust the level of the brightness in the app). I am a big fan of TV bias lighting, and I can definitely recommend the COMSYNC Immersion TV LED Backlights Kit, you will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "This effect is just so cool: I\u2019ve tried three different TV backlighting systems, searching for the perfect setup and experience. This one is close, but three things I\u2019ve noticed after one day of use:1. There can sometimes be a noticeable transition between colors, like the changes are stepped rather than a quick fade. If you\u2019re focusing on the TV and not the lights you probably won\u2019t notice after awhile, but guests probably will.2. Despite having 8K Ultra High Speed HDMI 2.1 cables in-use, the sync box doesn\u2019t work with my PS5. The Apple TV 4K (1st Gen.) works, but the PS5 shows no signal. Bypassing the sync box using the same cables works perfectly.3. Despite having 8K Ultra High Speed HDMI 2.1 cables in-use, the Apple TV 4K (1st Gen.) does not display in Dolby Vision (does get 4K HDR at 60hz). If I bypass sync box using same cables, Apple TV 4K (1st Gen.) displays in Dolby Vision, so another seeming compatibility limitation/issue.I\u2019ll continue diagnosing and update if I figure these out, but it\u2019s far from plug and play at this point.**2022-10-31**After some testing over the weekend, I think the PS5 issue is HDCP related. The PS5 currently uses HDCP 2.3, the sync box is HDCP 2.2, and my TV is HDCP 2.3: that seems like a possible incompatibility (though not sure where in the chain it is). I changed the cable from the sync box to an old monitor that is HDCP 1.4, and I saw the PS5 home screen, so that seems the likely explanation. Disabling HDCP in the PS5's system settings resulted in no change. Amazon indicates this product was released this year (2022): the choice to not use HDCP 2.3 (released last year) is strange. Note that the Apple TV 4K (1st Gen.) is currently HDCP 2.2. No additional information on why Dolby Vision isn't available for the Apple TV 4K (1st Gen.).**2022-11-01**Submitted support request through Amazon. I had previously emailed the support email address provided in the product's manual, but received no response after three days.**2022-11-02**Followed support's directions, and there was no success. Ticket has been passed on to their engineers for review, and to attempt to identify the issue with the Sony TV.**2022-11-07**Over the weekend I connected the PS5 to the sync box and the sync box to another TV (HDCP 1.4) and a monitor (HDCP 2.3) and both the PS5 video and lights worked, so seemingly not an HDCP incompatibility. My theory at this point is the PS5 and TV are trying to talk to each other in a specific way (because they're both Sony products); unfortunately I've only the one Sony TV, so can't test that theory.**2022-11-21**Engineering team determined the issues I'm experiencing are an incompatibility with my TV model. They said they tested a PS5 on a Sony TV (not my model), and had no issues, so only remaining conclusion is an incompatibility with my specific model. I do not believe any testing was done on why the Apple TV wouldn't get Dolby Vision, but probably fair to conclude same incompatibility. Hard to know if support is being honest (re their testing), but they have seemed to be helpful and want to solve my issues.",
