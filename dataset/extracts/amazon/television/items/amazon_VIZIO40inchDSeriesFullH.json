                "reviewText": "Purchased this TV during the 2023 holiday season on sale. With the cost saving I included the 2 year warranty as I am not someone who enjoys replacing things constantly beyond the original manufacturer\u2019s warranty. We also have a competitor\u2019s tv in OLED and a larger format in our home. I prefaced these detail in my review because I went into purchasing this item as a bedroom tv with the expectation that the image quality and the tv\u2019s operating system would be disappointing compared to our competitors brand OLED television; boy was I wrong. If the image quality of this tv was the only thing I could shared positive reviews about I would be doing an injustice to the really well engineered user experience this television accomplishes. As someone who has worked in the field of IT that supports knowledge and learning end-user experiences, I can say first hand that Vizio did their homework to give this SmartTV its Smarts with intuitive and intelligent software features in the TV and the App that works seamless together. Now about the image quality. It is clear from the initial setup, the demo and ultimately the software update of the tv\u2019s user interface that this tv\u2019s processor, for the cost, does an exceptional job at image reproduction. The 1080p Full Array LED is balanced, clear without appearing overly saturated and glossy which differs from OLED. I think for people who prefer a more balanced image reproduction that feels a bit more natural and not as \u201cprocessed\u201d, this Vizio\u2019s full HD engineering provides an experience that delivers on this description. I have not yet fully tested my Switch experience on this television beyond toggling a few games back and forth in the Switch UI and playing a few YouTube videos and some Hulu programming. So far, again, I am impressed. Having purchased this tv only based on the holiday sale price and reading a few reviews of other shoppers for this price, this television far exceeded everything I expected in a SmartTV at this price point. If you are shopping for a value driven over achieving SmartTV that isn\u2019t 4K or OLED, this is the one I would recommend.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A great, compact 1080p flatscreen at a great price with a few issues.",
                "reviewText": "We purchased this a couple of months ago (with our own money, no communication with or compensation from the company) as our old 43\" 720p flatscreen was starting to give out and have problems with the picture. We wanted to downsize a bit given the space in our living room, and didn't want to spend a lot of money for a TV with a ton of features that we weren't going to use. We did our research and settled on this 32\" Vizio as it had integrated Chromecasting (which we use every day) and a sharper picture than our old set without taking up a lot of room.After using it for a while now, we've got a pretty good idea of the ins and outs of this TV and how it works for our viewing habits. Some pros and cons:PROS:Sharp screen/picture quality - granted, it's not 4K/8K/etc., but it's quite a step up from the 720p screen we were used to. Even though it's much smaller size-wise, shows and movies are noticeably better. It does take some adjusting through the settings to find your ideal viewing settings; there are a few different settings for different use cases like gaming, and turning off the motion setting improved things for us as well, but make sure you play around with them to find what looks best to your eyes.Size and weight - it's featherweight compared to our old TV, very easy to mount and adjust and get where you want it without a lot of strain or stress.Inputs - you've got two HDMIs (one with ARC for using a soundbar), a USB port for powering something like a Roku, an antenna input and some various audio ins/outs. Unless you're looking for a plethora of input/outputs, this will do the job for the average person out there. Especially given the price, it would make a great secondary TV for a kids' playroom or similar location where you want to have one available but don't want to sink a lot of money into extraneous features.Built-in Chromecasting - this is a great included feature, and frees up one of the HDMI inputs that we were using on our old set for a 2nd Gen Chromecast. We ran into a problem with this initially that I'll talk about below, but it seems to have smoothed itself out somehow.The Vizio TV app - we have Android phones and I really like the Vizio app for controlling the TV (switching inputs, scrolling through Netflix/Hulu, etc.). We have a cable box that can also scroll through inputs but not other settings, but for cord cutters or people who don't want to bother with a few different remotes the app connects quickly and reliably to allow you to control things.WatchFree - I just started scrolling through the included free movies and shows last night, and there's a good selection to watch. Granted, if you're using other streaming services then you might either run into duplicates or option overload, but it's nice that Vizio gives you some extra choices for viewing when you purchase their TVs with this feature.Streaming apps - we use our phones and Chromecasting to watch Netflix/Hulu/etc., but you have a bunch of apps that you can load onto the TV itself and use in place of your phone if you so choose. Better to have more options in this respect than fewer, I figure.CONS:The speakers - they're not great, our old TV was more powerful but we've gotten used to them at this point. We thought about getting a cheap soundbar but decided against it. Just know that for the price, you're not getting an audio powerhouse. You can link a soundbar up multiple ways (look at the user manual online for instructions) if you require sharper sound. It can get plenty loud, it's just that the quality overall isn't fantastic. We don't watch a lot of stuff where we'd need super-high-def sound, so it works fine for us. They're down-firing rather than forward-firing, which may have something to do with it.Chromecasting - I haven't had any problems at all, but my wife's phone wouldn't connect reliably for a while. We plugged in our old Chromecast for her to connect to, and now she hasn't had any problems with either the built-in or external Chromecast. I'm not sure what did the trick, but I'm not going to question a miracle. She found online that other have had problems with reliable built-in Chromecasting, but given our experience YMMV. I made sure that the TV connected to our WiFi with a static address to isolate that variable, but the only thing that seemed to work was the solution above.The picture settings - there are a few different default settings for things like gaming, motion enhancement, etc. It can be a bit to go through in order to find your perfect setting(s), but if it's not looking great at first just try playing around with those settings. I thought I was going to have to return it because the picture was a little dark around the edges and the motion enhancement was driving me nuts, but luckily I decided to play around with things and voila - I haven't messed around with the picture settings since the first week we got it. It'd just be nice to have it start with a more common 'default' setting rather than one that's supposed to give you a great picture but in reality is just full of supposed enhancements in color, motion, contrast, etc.All in all, I think it's a great TV for the price. It's got enough extras to cover the bases for most people and use cases if you're looking for a TV at this size and price range, without a bunch of stuff you'll never use. It sets up quickly in terms of getting it out of the box, upright, and plugged in in order to use without having to go through a phonebook-sized manual (anyone remember phonebooks?) to figure it out. The phone app is also very helpful and easy to set up, and I'd recommend this TV to others looking for the same thing we were.",

It has a headphone jack so at night I can put my headphones on and not wake anyone. It has a crystal clear picture as well. It has many color/brightness adjustments as well. I absolutely love this tv and am surprised at the performance. You can download the Vizio app and operate this tv from your phone.
