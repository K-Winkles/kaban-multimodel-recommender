                "reviewText": "I had to upgrade from my 2014 60\" tv since it was only 1080p and I really really wanted a 4K TV. This one was worth the price and It was so damn easy to set up (still recommend having two people set up, makes it 1000x easier and quicker)! After the easy set up and knowing whats on the remote, it was easy to use. Coming from an older look and also interface within the TV, it was easy to navigate and just looks very nice. Best part was that the TV stand for this TV was higher than my other that I could easily slide my sound bar under it to make even more room on my TV stand. Picture quality is great. Though i would turn off the frame rate option. I heard many people dont like that, though its a cool but now very old feature, it just makes your shows and movies look simple and cheap. Aside from that everything internal is great about this TV. I was able to set up all my devices to it and even my antenna up. Some people did mention not liking the smart TV part of it using Google's built in TV features. Though im not a fan of Google, I still never use the built in TV apps and features in the TV. Just use the plug in TV app devices. Whether you use the Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick, Roku, or whatever else, its just easier and faster to use it on the TV rather than the built in smart TV Google interface. Thats just my two cents. Did i mention that the picture quality is amazing?! I will keep this tv for a very long time .",

I have Amazon Prime, my order came with free delivery and setup service.This 65\u201d Sony Bravia was delivered on schedule. The delivery team was courteous and handled the new set with care. I had made up a checklist to ensure that\u2026- screen was not cracked,- no scratches on the set- no pixel defects- that it was brand new, not used\u2026I did not sign up with a Google account, not now, for fear that the Google voice would create confusions. I shall look into this after I have used the set for a few days.The setup was easy and straightforward and it paired my TV box seamlessly, setup my network without issue, and even used Air-Play.Picture quality was amazingly bright, clear and sharp. I had not changed the screen settings\u2026 just use the default and is already very good.And last of all, I\u2019m very pleased that Amazon sells the model at an affordable price.I love Sony TVs and I look forward to having many hours of viewing pleasure with my better half.Highly RECOMMENDED \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d",

The replacement TV is all that you might expect from SONY. Excellent quality in picture and sound. Paired with a Vizio Sound Bar, it is an outstanding value and excellent TV. We have a 46\" Sony that cost more than twice as much in 2010, that still works as it should - hopefully this one will last as long. The TV has smart features, but; we don't use them, ROKU works well to provide variety.",

                "reviewText": "This TV definitely lives up to the Sony name. This is the first Sony TV I have bought, although I have owned Sony Shortwave radios and I am still using an old Sony DVD recorder with a ATSC tuner. I have always consider Sony to be top of the line with receivers.This TV has an awesome picture and for a flat screen great sound. I had to tweak the sound and picture settings. Especially the sound settings, to get the best performance, the factory settings really did not produce very good sound. I was also able to pair a Bluetooth headphone set to the TV. I primary bought this for the Next Gen tuner, although I have not been able test it yet, but I am sure I will. I primarily watch OTA (TV over the air) and live in a marginal area for TV reception, so I am more interested in it as a receiver. I have been watching OTA for over 12 years with a Roku box added in. As far as the receiver, it works as good and marginally better then other TV\u2019s I am using on the same antenna system. In the help menu it has a signal diagnostic feature which gives signal strength and the all important Signal to Noise Ratio. It also lets you add digital channels, so you can turn the antenna and add channels, without having to do a full channel scan.Features I like about Google TV. Sony allows you to install a full feature web browser. Google TV, also allows to add channels from Pluto and Xumo (and actually pick which channels you want to add) to your TV tuner app, allowing you to surf streaming channels with your over the air channels.So far I have nothing negative to say. I would recommend this TV to my friends.",

I had no idea how much difference in technology there was with a smart TV. The technology makes using the TV so easy , the remote is also easy to use . If I'm watching one app and I want to switch to another app which is on the remote I can do it with just one press of a button. When I'm looking at the lists of shows and movies I get auto previews of each one - so helpful. On the home screen I have many choices of various shows to watch such as you tube shows, documentaries, movies etc. The TV turns on and off immediately and the picture quality and sound are great. There's so much more , I enjoy using the TV , can't wait to turn it on. I was able to sideload my other apps that I had on my android box as well so I have way more to choose from now compared to the android box.",

                "reviewText": "Bright and vibrant colours. Got it for $899CAD on a special sale at amazon in June. If you're not using the TV for gaming or need 120Hz feature... this TV is great. Save the money and get a bigger size. Before I had a 50\" LG which went dead after 13 years. This is a great replacement. I thought 65\" was too big but it gives a different perspective when viewing old TV shows e.g. Star Trek, Miami Vice, Combat! etc. It comes with google TV which is the successor to Android TV. Install VLC media player and can play all movies from my NAS on my network.Update: Mar 2022: Unfortunately, HDMI port 1, which is what I used to connect the Roger cable box... has failed. Now I have to use HDMI port 2. Sony quality is slipping... may have to call Sony support and get unit replacement or fix...",
