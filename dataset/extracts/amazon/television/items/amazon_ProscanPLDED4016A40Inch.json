The picture is great but the sound doesn't seem to be Dolby. Maybe it's just my hearing.",

We got this \"dumb\" tv because it had a built in tuner for the antenna and two HDMI ports for our streaming and casting devices. We added speakers as well as the TV sound is tinny on it's own. We couldn't be happier with a tv that doesn't need to connect to the Internet, that is so simple to operate and has a very nice menu interface. We stream all our favorite services (via HDMI devices) and use the antenna for local stations. Very happy with this tv!!",
