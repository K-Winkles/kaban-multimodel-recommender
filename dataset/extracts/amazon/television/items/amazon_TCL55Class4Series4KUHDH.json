                "reviewText": "Hi Everyone,This is an excellent entry-level 4K TV at a good price with a 1-year warranty! I have been using this TV for over 3 months before writing any reviews or comments. I did a lot of research before buying a new TV and this was considered the best lower-cost 4K TV with Roku that was available. I Highly recommend this TV.You do need to have an Internet connection and email address to register with Roku to use all the superb streaming options. You can always create a free email account just for TV stuff if you don't want to use your main email. You do not need to add a payment method (credit card or debit card, etc...) unless you want to, otherwise, just select to skip that. You can always sign up for additional streaming services, called channels, on the internet using your computer or smartphone and they will work when added to your Roku channels.So far, I am very impressed with the picture quality, especially when streaming any of the Roku channels (streaming services), or viewing video files, or DVD + Blu-Ray discs, or through the Live TV over the air (OTA) antenna. Anything with 720p resolution or higher looks great, very nice upscaling, and anything with HDR is awesome. Even on my low speed 5 Mbps internet connection, the streaming looks really good, yet for 4K video streaming it is recommended to have a min. 15 Mbps to 25 Mbps+ internet connection.Totally recommend using a quality surge protector or UPS (battery backup) with any electronics you care about.I suggest running a software update in the system settings after setting up the TV for the first time, it is automatic after that. Also, this TV has a large bright LED activity light that stays on disturbing my sleep which you can disable in the settings. You can also select a default startup option like the HDMI input 1 (HDMI cable box on mine), Live TV (coax cable or antenna), or the main Roku menu (the default setting), etc...Initially, I was disappointed with the HOA-required Comcast Xfinity cable service because the picture quality was not nearly as good as the streaming options, or when viewing video files from my media server or USB or DVD Blu-Ray discs or Live TV antenna. But, that is because the Xfinity Comcast cable DTA box is only at 480i and even the free upgraded HDMI DTA cable box is only at 720p or 1080i and the picture quality is just okay. FYI: Progressive (p) video format is better than Interlaced (i). I find that the cable box picture looks better at 720p or 1080i with the TV picture gaming setting enabled and it is still not nearly as good as 720p or 1080p from streaming channels or antenna or video files or discs. Any dark scenes using cable box HDMI are almost too dark to distinguish details, very annoying. I tried 3 HDMI cables, HDMI 2, high speed HDMI 2, and 4K HDMI 2.1 which didn't help. The coaxial connection has lower resolution, but the dark scenes look better and whatever your watching will stabilize and look better overall. The only way to get higher quality video from Xfinity Comcast cable is through their free Streaming app and your Internet service provider (ISP) or by using their free TV WiFi box which I think requires using their Xfinity Internet Service (X1 Wireless TV Box (Xi5 or Xi6) or Flex streaming TV Box (Xi5, Xi6 or XiOne).Additional comments: I was surprised that a TV purchased in April 2022 and manufactured in January of 2022 did not have USB v3.x port(s) and HDMI v2.1 or newer ports although it does have an HDMI v2.1 audio Arc port, but not the enhanced eArc port. The HDMI Arc port can be used as a 3rd regular HDMI port if not used for audio. More ports would be really nice. This model has a 60 Hz display refresh rate with a 120 Hz CMI (Clear Motion Index); This is not a true 120 Hz display refresh rate, but I have not noticed any negative video refresh related issues except on low-quality videos or slower Internet. Note: Some new gaming systems may require an HDMI 2.1 port and an actual 120 Hz refresh rate. There is no Bluetooth either. Also, the included TCL Roku remote does not have the voice button, yet my $40 Roku Streaming Stick + remote has the voice button??? The Roku app on my Android phone does have the voice option though when connected to the TCL TV.And, the Roku Media Player could use some major updates and or perhaps porting VLC into Roku because I noticed that some videos either through my media server or video files on USB drive would not play audio correctly because this TV cannot handle all the various video and audio formats like 7 or 8 channel audio, yet they all play well on my computers, and the video playback navigation controls may or may not work with various media servers? The Plex media server app works well. The Roku Media Player with USB drives does not seem to recognize the exFat file system either which is a common format.Finally, I would also recommend getting an extended warranty through Amazon or through TCL.",

                "reviewText": "My brother and I searched for a decent TV at an affordable price for my mother after she moved into a new apartment. We did a lot of research, read a lot of reviews, and decided to try this one out.It's really good! Even after a couple of years of consistent, everyday, use. The set up is easy, even for people who don't do things like this often. The remote is pre-paired ahead of time, and while you are required to put in information into the ROKU system, you won't be charged suddenly because it's just for if you have a subscription or rent something.The picture is clean, and the audio is crisp. Especially for a TV in this price zone. The subtitles are also really easy to read on the screen, and there isn't much (if any) delay. So I do recommend this for someone searching for a TV.Now, the only issue I personally have is with the remote. The design is minimal. So on the right side of the remote is the volume and mute buttons, which is frustratingly easy to press when you're in the middle of a show and forgot to put down the remote. That is the only issue with the remote I have. For those curious the rest of the remote (on the front) has a power, back and then a home button. Followed by on screen navigation, and the video controls. There are also shortcuts to Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Sling.Now, after a couple of years, I myself am moving into a new apartment and was looking for a TV. After seeing this in person, and how well it has held up I decided to purchase a second one for myself.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this TV for a few weeks now and I only have a lot of positive things to report! I haven't experienced any major issues minus the delivery person who actually left it at the wrong address but thankfully my neighbor told him that he was at the wrong address and it was delivered to me shortly after.There are many great aspects of this TV but the best part about it to me is the ease of setup and use. I took it out of the box carefully. It was very well packaged. Once the plastic straps are cut the bottom of the box separates from the sides to reveal your new TV. Then I installed the legs with the included hardware once I found a screwdriver. Ended up somehow putting one of the legs the wrong way but that was an awkward but fairly simple fix. Setting up each streaming platform/account wasn't difficult and everything was was easy to download. The remote is super handy and user friendly. It already has buttons to pull up Disney +, Netflix and hulu plus sling Tv for those that use it. The volume and mute are on the sides which is different than other remotes but it isn't a bad thing.The picture quality is excellent! I love having the built in Roku as my other TV has a fireTV stick which is also nice. I've easily learned and adjusted to both. Overall I really really enjoy everything about it.If an app says it struggles to connect for example I just turn the TV off wait a second and turn it back on and everything works normally/perfectly again. I've had to do this several times so I'm hoping that it won't become a bigger issue especially in the future. I can handle turning it off once in awhile and turning it back on fully functioning again.I definitely would recommend this TV at this point! I love the affordable price and great quality. If for some reason that changes and I jinxed myself (hopefully I didn't) then I will be sure to update my review pronto!",
