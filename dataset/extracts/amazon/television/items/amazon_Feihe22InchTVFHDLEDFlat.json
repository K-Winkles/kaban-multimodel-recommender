Use your Comcast/Cable/Verizon/Xfinity/Spectrum/Fios remote control for everything else,the network providers do not recognize the manufacturer.Model number of TV was not able to be found. Q: How to use the antenna with Feihe 19 inch tv? A: It all depends on your local reception and where the TV is located in the house\uff08Closer to the window works better\uff09in order to pick up a signal. Use an indoor antenna, but only receive several channels if you live close to mountains and have poor reception without a dish or cable. Other areas, with an antenna are more successful. When the signal is strong the picture is good! Q: TV not compatible with our cable TV provider? A: First: The cable box needs to support the CEC function Second: Then the cable box should be set to open the CEC function Third: TV under HDMI channel, select MENU->OPTION->HDMI CEC->Select the last DeviceList, search for CEC support Search for the channel, then use Feihe's remote control to remote control the TV box. Q: What if the TV speaker does not work, the screen is broken (or Black / Blue Vertical Line), or the remote control does not work? A: Please contact the seller in time.",

                "reviewText": "We were really leery about ordering this tv with all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance. So glad we did. The picture is very clear and the colors are vibrant. The sound is great. Lots of reviewers said it sounded like a tin can but this sound is perfect - no need to hook up to speakers. We purchased this for the kitchen, to replace a 19\" Phillips that conked out after many years. The size is perfect for our countertop. It's nice and compact. without a lot of bulk. The fact that you can take this along while traveling is definitely a plus. It comes with the cord that plugs into your car, boat or RV. And, the screen does tilt for different viewing angles. My husband just loosened the two screws on the stand a little and voila! We don't have cable and just use the antenna and firestick. Both play without a problem. Scanning with the antenna picked up over 60 channels alone. Only one minor concern - No where on this tv or the instructions does it list the Feihe brand name, just ATSC. Otherwise, very happy with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I got this TV to put in a small camper, so it's not a primary use TV for sure. The real only redeeming value here is that it runs off of 12v and includes a 12v plug (cig plug). Other than that, there are way better TV's out there for less money than this if you don't need any of the 12v stuff.The sound quality on this tv is horrendous. It is muffled and flat. Luckily, our little camper has a sound system that I plan to use for sound instead. So, it gets a pass.The picture is not great. In fact, out of the box the picture is really bad. However, with some adjustments in the menu it can be made better. For some reason it has a \"noise reduction\" mode which, from what I can tell, all it does is make the picture softer by blurring the edges. So, turn that off. Then it's so oversaturated that you might need to turn down the contrast a touch and the color a bit. That should help it improve.Lastly, I needed to mount this thing to the camper wall. The two top M4 screws on the mount would go in just fine. However, the two bottom ones would not. They turned in about 1/8 inch and would stop. Looking inside the screw hole shows something in the way.The pros here are that it is small enough to fit in our small camper, it does have a full HD screen (many TV's this size are only 720p), and it is 12v which is kinda hard to find.Overall, not a good experience with this TV. I have another week to decide to return it or keep it so, we'll see.",
