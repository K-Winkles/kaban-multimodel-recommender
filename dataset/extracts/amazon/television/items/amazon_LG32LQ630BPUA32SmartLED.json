                "reviewText": "A few years ago I had bought a 43 inch LG Smart TV and I was amazed at the quality, such a beautiful picture. It's easy to navigate through the different apps, more of which you can find for download at the Google Play store.That led me to buy this LG 630 model. Has the same great qualities as the one mentioned above. I'm so happy with it that I am thinking of getting a second 32-inch one for my sunroom. Do some Price shopping on this one, I'm seeing it as low as 169 at Sam's Club and I think Best Buy dropped its price to that recently also.The remote that comes with it is fairly small in the buttons are a little too close together in some rows. That was easily resolved by spending $10 on a generic LG remote that is much bigger and nicer to use.I do also have the 32-in 630",
