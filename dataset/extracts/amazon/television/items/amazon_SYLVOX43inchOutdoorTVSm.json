The fan is needed to keep the TV cool on a hot day and prolong its life.The picture quality and brightness are very good.It is best to get a sound bar if you do not intend to wire the TV into your sound system as the built in speakers produce sound that is a bit distorted with a (sometimes) rattle.Netflix and Prime and some other services are built in but if you want Apple TV, for example, you will need to stream from a firestick or the like. You can't download them but there is a streaming option built in.The after sales service could not have been better.",

The only issue with the tv would have to be the loudness and quality of the sound. you really have to turn the volume up almost all the way to hear the tv. I will definately have to invest in a sound bar for outside. Now just have to find one for outside that doesn't cost arm and a leg. HELP. but def a good tv.",

                "reviewTitle": "Well built, but don't expect 1000 nits",
                "reviewText": "I'll make this fairly short and sweet. First, the good:The TV has a good bit of heft to it and the protective case feels quite solid, well constructed and is sealed well. I'm confident this would be well protected from the elements. I also liked the design and size of the rear compartment to access HDMI and other inputs. It looks like the connections are likewise well protected. Picture wise, it was clear as expected and had zero dead pixels.Next, the not so good:The specs claim 1000 nits brightness, but unfortunately my impression after doing a side by side comparison with my Sony X900H (about 450 to 500 nits max with SDR, 700 nits max for peak HDR) is that the Sylvox is only about on par with the Sony. The current Samsung 4K TV that I use outdoors (deck) is about 360 to 400 nits with SDR but I wanted something quite a bit brighter. Since my needs are for a very bright SDR image outdoors to watch baseball during the summer I wanted something that could truly approach 800 nits SDR minimum. Sadly this model isn't it.While the Sylvox is definitely brighter than your average SDR HDTV (and I think most people will be happy with the brightness if using under a covered deck) anyone who wants an ultra bright image may want to spend extra on the next model up (rated at 2000 nits, should be at least 1000).A couple of other things you need to be aware of is that this is not a \"smart\" TV. It isn't a really a negative per se since you can install a relatively inexpensive Fire TV 4K MAX in the rear compartment easily where it's also protected, and well supported.Lastly, I have a sneaking suspicion that the included remote is not water resistant. It feels cheap and plasticky, so don't get it wet. Better still, install a Fire TV 4K MAX and use that remote instead after you've done your basic TV picture calibrations / setup. Another nitpic is the screws that secure the rear compartment panel. They're tightened by finger but too smooth to get a good grip sometimes.",
