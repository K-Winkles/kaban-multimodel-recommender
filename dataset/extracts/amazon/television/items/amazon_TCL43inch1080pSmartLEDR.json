                "reviewText": "First, the \"bad\" part: I took advantage of a great sale on Prime Day and bought this TV, in part because we wanted a bigger TV in our den, and in part because the home theater system we have has streaming apps that will no longer be supported by Amazon and Hulu. When the TV arrived, the screen was broken. There was a pressure fracture right in the middle of the screen when turned on. A few clicks on Amazon's site, and I had a replacement TV on the way and a pre-paid mailing label. I was mildly inconvenienced by having to drive 5 miles to our local UPS pick-up location. The replacement TV arrived 5 days later (due to the weekend) and was in perfect condition.On to the TV: This is a budget smart TV. The speakers are good but not great. The picture is more than acceptable to me. The price was right. Options for the TV are good. You will need to have a Roku account to get the maximum benefits of this TV. The initial TV set-up is fairly intuitive. I had never heard of HDMI ARC until I bought this TV. Now, when I turn on the TV, it will also turn on my home theater system, put the system in the correct mode, and play through the home theater. If I turn off the home theater, the TV will then turn on its own speakers. Simple, but neat tech.My only complaint about this TV: It doesn't default to the last video setting when you turn it off and back on. My DirecTV Genie remote will turn the TV on and off (plus control the volume), but if I plop down in my chair and turn the TV on with the Genie remote, I will still need to have the TCL/Roku remote in hand to select satellite TV.Edit: I found the setting within the menu that allows the TV to automatically turn on the satellite TV.Last tidbits: Legs are easy to attach (watch! They have a front and back). Sleep timer requires you to go into the menu, rather than just pressing a single remote button like on my other TCL televisions. The IR receiver in located near the little white light in the middle underside, and you have to hold the remote towards that location; I don't know if the IR beam is narrowly focused, or if the receiver isn't very sensitive. 3 HDMI ports. If you are looking at the TV as though viewing it, the power cord and cables will come out towards your right side.",

                "reviewText": "So the past several years I just do everything on my PC, games and shows and movies I'd just watch there I used to have a nice home entertainment setup but not anymore I now have an awesome \"gaming room\" :) But I decided especially with the pandemic right now and stuck working from home I spend 8-9 working hours sitting in front of that computer desk and in that chair, it would be nice to retreat to something more relaxing. So I decided to upgrade my TV situation so I can lounge on the couch and watch movies and shows. I started looking online and I came across this brand TCL. I researched them and they have made their way up the ranks and are like the 3rd largest TV manufacturer now. Now for the same price (within 10 bucks) I could have gotten the 4K version of this TV but I'm not picky and all my media I have stored is a@ 1080p so at this time I didn't think 4K was needed so I went with this version 49in @ 1080 but it has all the same Smart TV features as the 4K model. It has a built in Roku which I hear is like 50 bucks on its own. This is my first smart TV. First off its a small thing really but I have to say this little remote it comes with is great, its oddly satisfying with the way it clicks. Responsive. I've watched a few movies on it and the picture is wonderful sound is ok, definitely nothing special probably just there to get the job done, and would have been satisfactory on their own, but I hooked up some nice logitech stereo speakers that I used to use on my PC. I would say the only negative about the TV itself would be the very shiny screen which causes lots of light glare. I have blackout curtains so its not an issue for me. The Smart TV allowed me to setup a few channels (youtube, wwe network, and roku media player) The media player is awesome the TV allowed me to attach an external harddrive via usb and I'm able to directly access all my shows and movies I have on them and it plays them flawlessly. I think this TV is absolutely wonderful for the price ($250). Get this one or the equivalent 4K version. You'll love it.Note: If you purchase it online and have it shipped before getting it all setup, get the power cord out and test the TV. The first one was damaged in shipping and the screen was busted (not to mention the delivery driver put it on the neighbors porch...) But amazon was right on it, they got a new one shipped out with 48 hours to me and they had UPS come and pick the broken one up in 24 hours. But this had nothing to do with the TVs quality and I won't punish the score for the TV itself for that issue, not to mention Amazon was super on it.",

                "reviewText": "A very fine 40\u201c 1080 p TV for a small price. I have owed this TV for about a week and have been pleased with the picture for movies, sports and network TV. If you a looking for a basic TV with a great picture this is it. Moreover I can control the on and off, volume and channels all through the Alex app. And Roku is seemlessly built in. If your a cord cutter like I am this a great upgrade. Roku TV alone gives you at least 50 channels and good free movies. Now add the Roku app to your phone and you never need to find you remote again. The Roku on thid TV is probably one of the best features. Delivered to my door in four days with out any issues. Thanks Amazon and UPS. My only negative comment is that getting this TV to work with Alexa is going to require patience. It is good AI after you figure it out but it is not intuitive. In short Alexa will control this device but Roku wants an honorable mentionwhen you say the command: \"Alexa, channel 3.1 on Living Room TV.\" Alexa will respond. \"Tuning to 3.1 on Roku\". So understand you are controling the TV but it wants to tell you you are using the Roku software. This is really no different from any other device but my smart plugs don't annouce \"turning on your lamp through Kaza\". BTW Kaza is a brand of smart plug. (best plug in my opinion-pun intened)So I share all of this as it is really cool when it works. When controlling the TV fuctions such as on and off and volume the TV says nothing about Roku. But tell it to go to Channel 27 it wants credit but keep in mind your talking to Alexa and she has apprently agreed to allow her smart friend Roku to take some credit for some of her smart AI functions. In closing... Buy it! Thanks TLC for making a good product at a decent price!",
