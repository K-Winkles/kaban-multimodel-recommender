                "reviewText": "Update: I have been using a ROKU Streambar for sound (which died today) and now I\u2019m having to use the sound from the TV. Sound quality also sucks on this TV. \ud83d\ude44\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-I bought this TV somewhere else in January 2021, and I wish I had purchased a different model. My previous Vizio experiences have all been very good, which is one reason this TV has disappointed me so much. There is something wrong with the picture. I\u2019ve tried adjusting settings, I\u2019ve bought new HDMI cables, but nothing has helped. The picture is like this no matter what I\u2019m using: ROKU, BluRay player or Comcast TV.I\u2019ve attached two pictures that give you an idea of the problem. The picture with the orange spot on the lady\u2019s forehead is a discoloration in the TV, not in the production itself. I get these weird squares I can see, almost like it\u2019s pixelated, but larger. It causes things to be off color, or distorted. You can see the weird little boxes in the other picture.This TV is wall mounted, which I had to pay someone to do. I am also past the 90 day return, so I think I would have to deal with Vizio directly? To get it down, I would have to pay someone to do that, and then figure out how to get it to the store, if they would even take it back at this point. For a TV that cost me about $364, it\u2019s just not worth the hassle. I\u2019ll put up with it as long as I can then just replace it with a different one.I will have serious reservations about getting another Vizio if this is the quality they are putting out these days.Don\u2019t buy this model. It\u2019s slick looking, and a nice size, but the picture is no good on kind. Is it a random defective unit?No idea, but keep shopping, seriously.",
