The remote took me about a day to become comfortable with, but so nice being able to control everything so smoothly. Bouncing from TV to 4k blu ray to Netflix or Amazon is literally lightning fast. I liken it to when I finally began using SSD in my laptop and upgraded ram to 32. Colors are vibrant, the picture modes are easy to switch between. It was even smart enough to know how to control my UVERSE cable box. Amazon did a great job of delivering on-time using enhanced scheduled delivery. My friends were very complimentary of both the design and performance of this device.",

                "reviewText": "Had this TV for 4 years. Works flawlessly. I saw other review that said picture was blotchy and squared off in places. That's because they didn't have the proper voltage going to it. It happened to me also so I took the receptacle out and could tell that the wires were not making good contact. Once I got the proper voltage and amperage allowed to go to the wires it's work flawlessly. Before I read about the voltage lost can cause that to happen half of my TV on the left side had gone out. And I know that's a characteristic of TVs going bad. But I'd only had this TV for a short amount of time and so I thought maybe something else was wrong other than it just wearing out. And so now a year later after I fix my receptacle it works perfectly",

For those of you with elderly parents, i should not need to explain my reasons \"why\".But on the UN65KS9500 with the OneConnect Mini, there is absolutely no way to do this... not via analog audio (no jack either on the TV or the OneConnect)... not via bluetooth because they can only power one or the other (home theater via optical out OR Bluetooth, but NOT BOTH)... so it is Bluetooth and TV speakers OR Bose Home Theater.for a $3000 TV, this is just absurd!I have talked with Samsung and their online support if awful... not very technical and english is definitely not their first (or second) language. They have no solution. I have headsets on all our TVs, but this one.Awful.",

Only problem we have is our room has a lot of windows so we get reflections on the screen so we have to draw the curtains other than that it's fabulous",

OS is locked down so you can' t install whatever you want unless you flash unapproved firmware and risk turning your great TV into a $4500 curved brick.All things considered I'm satisfied with this as a great TV.The so called open source TIZEN OS is a flop though because it is locked up to the user..Keeping my fingers crossed that a SAMYGO rev will come up that works on it.",
