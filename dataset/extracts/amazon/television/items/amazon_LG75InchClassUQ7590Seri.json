Don't know how to describe it. After a few I realized what was going on was it seemed more like I was watching things going on through a window they looked so \"real\". That's why at first it seemed \"off\". I was going to let Wife pic out a sound bar next. We will get a Surround Sound at some time but the built in has options to make it also sound amazing. Shockingly nice for so little money all the way around.Remote is kind of \"odd\", but I had already ordered a better one made for this TV. Just put batteries in it and it is already programed to the TV.",

                "reviewText": "TV is great quality and user friendly, image great very clear, sound is really good however a I added a small sound bar to it, the size was perfect for my bedroom it easy to mount on the wall as TV is not that heavy, the only thing I don\u2019t like from it, it\u2019s the remote control that comes with it, it is very simple and cheaply made, the tv WebOS is modern but in order to get the best of it, it is advisable to get the LG magic remote to get the best of it, with the magic remote you are able to control all the devices with just that remote, including external sound bar and cable box, regardless of the way it is connected to the TV, wheeler be thru HDMI or digital out, overall this a decent, good and affordable Tav to upgrade your bedroom, or kids TV, you won\u2019t be disappointed.CJ,",

Picture is superb and it is a smart TV (smarter than me). We dropped the satellite system and went with Youtube TV over fiber. It quickly found the WiFi and asked for the password.",

Amazon refused to take it back or replace it to contact the seller. I contact LG they say I have to talk to Amazon. They won\u2019t even provide warranty support. Beware LG!!!",
