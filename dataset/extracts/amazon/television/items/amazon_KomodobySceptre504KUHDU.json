                "reviewText": "I decided to get a new tv so that I could actually watch what I want to every once in a while. I kept looking at the usual products, but after having a smart tv that cost $1500 only a few years ago, and is now as slow and responsive as an iPad Gen 1, I figured id do a dumb tv and buy roku/fire/chrome cast device. Since I already had two 144hz Sceptre gaming monitors that I like, I figured let\u2019s try something bigger.Boy did I instantly realize LG Sony Samsung should be focusing more on being a tv, and let a separate device be the computer chip you can upgrade every year for $50.I now have a pretty decent tv, super fast and responsive and headphone pairing roku speaker that allows me to play Valhalla or watch some Luther while the girls watch their shows or while I work! All for a 1/3 the price.I am able to play games at 60hz and 60FPS with a good picture. Obviously my 144hz gaming monitors are better and needed, when I\u2019m playing a more intensive From Software game, but Netflix and regular gaming work great on this.Here\u2019s hoping this market gets bigger so there are more options for just a tv, not some wanna be OS that is not intuitive and slow after a year.",

I chose 1080p60hz because I have it connected to a computer, and it just doesn't look right with the scaling at 2160p, and 30hz was annoying when moving the mouse around and such. 1080p60 looks much better for me, and I think I'd rather it. I don't watch 4K video anyway. I've only recently started getting into 1080p bluray, and I don't think I care to get a uhd bluray drive or player anytime soon, although theoretically 2160p30hz should be ok for watching uhd movies anyway, so if I really cared I'd just switch display modes or something.It's probably not the highest quality display, but I'm happy for the $200 I paid (price before tax. Never happy about tax, but that's not related).Not sure I'd pay a lot more for it though. I saw the price went up sometime after I bought it.",

It was actually a bit lighter than I thought it would be. I was able to remove it from its packaging and set all up without any help.

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I believe I received a TV that was not new. I had a sinking feeling as I pulled the TV out of the box that it was already used. The 'feet' were wrapped in different colored plastic. When I went to install the feet, there were minor wear marks where the screws secured the feet to the TV. OK I thought - as long as it works, I won't complain.Well, it kind of worked, but there is a huge vertical bar several inches wide that is off-colored and has flashing lines in the middle of it. This is obvious even when turning the TV on and the 'Sceptre' logo is displayed, so I know it is not an issue with the input.Sadly, I'm returning this TV and do not plan on buying another one. I cannot recommend this TV after this experience.",

                "reviewText": "The Komodo by Sceptre 50\" 4K UHD Ultra Slim LED TV is a low-end, Non-Smart, very basic 50\" LED Flat Screen with a good picture. Audio features are vaguely explained in the description and annoying audio surprises await you:* The built in speakers are very low end with a \"tinty\" sound, absent of any high or low range capability. If you plan to use internal speakers only, keep looking, this TV is not for you.* Except for HDMI, the other built-in input & output plug functions on the bottom and side of the TV are not labeled next to the plug or in the instructions.* The 3.5 mm female headphone output plug was found to be dead. No settings revived this plug.* If you want to add an external audio device, the optical plug on the bottom row is the only audio output port available. On the TV menu, go to sound, turn on digital sound to activate this output port.* If you have a quality surround sound entertainment system with optical audio input capability, this TV is a good option for you.* The external audio device needs to contain an amplifier and separate remote control for sound volume. The TV remote control will no longer adjust the sound setting.* Optical output requires a standard male-to-male fiber audio cable (not included) to the input port of your external audio device (about $8).* On the TV menu, go to sound, turn off the internal speaker.* If the external audio device does not have optical audio input port, you can buy a optical-to-analog converter (not included) for about $10. Most common, the analog output is left & right cable with red & white RCA male plugs each end. The converter can be powered by the USB port available on the TV side plugs which turns on & off with TV power.",
