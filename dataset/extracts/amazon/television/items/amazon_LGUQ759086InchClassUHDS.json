I had a 75\u201dHisense that went without no warning in two years. So with disappointment I decided to upgrade to a larger size and a LG. The remote has numbers. My other television didn\u2019t. But loving this LG right now. The delivery guy said it was a good television. I bought a three protection plan just in case. LG 86\u201d yes and yes two thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. At the time of purchaseing this tv there was only 1 review, and at a lower price, but after extensive research and owning the slightly smaller 75in version of this LG smart tv that I've been completely satisfied with and is only a yesr old. I decided this 86in would fit my needs then would use the 75in in another room in the house.. Let's start from delivery to unboxing then set up where flawless, can't believe the negative reviews or being damaged apon deliverey. I personally can't say anything bad about this tv its packed with features and a good detailed clear picture just go into settings and fine tune the picture settings ect. And you won't be disappointed.. also when watching the LG channels the movies are super clear and detailed just as expected... oh yeah did I mention football games look great too just make sure the settings for sports are tailored to your liking. Like smooth motion mode works great for sports.. just make sure you have good cables when connecting this tv so you get the most from it.. I currently have good HDMI cables and running FIBER OPTIC from the tv through my klipsch home theater system. Even Bluetooth/ wifi work with no problems.. bottom line don't cheap out when hooking your tv up... Updated with a short video showing just how good the picture is! Go steelers \ud83d\ude03 Update a month after having time to enjoy this tv its better than expected! At the time of the first review there where only1 review now there's 26, alot of broken apon deliverey and others having issues.. so far no issues here and can't stress how good this tv is really is ! It's a shame there are so many broken or unhappy people out there! When buying anything on Amazon i always check out the reviews before I decide on purchasing, but when it comes to this monster of a tv trust the positive reviews! It definitely has a stunning 4k quality picture like I said in the beginning use quality cables or fiber optics.. FYI: having only an antenna when watching your local stations actually Brodcast clear as streaming movies through wifi or Bluetooth!",
