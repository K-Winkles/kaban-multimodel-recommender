                "reviewText": "This TV is the BEST! Great TV picture quality, but also is a piece of art! Until you see it you can't realize how close to a piece of art it seems to be when off.. The TV is heavier that you think, really needs 2-3 to install it properly. Take your time to mount the brackets to make sure they are in the exact correct position and level. There is only one thin (I'm guessing optical) wire that needs to go to the TV from a box that can be hid in a cabinet. No line of sight needed for the remote (I think it is on radio waves). It mounts extremely close to the wall, enhancing the piece of art look. I got the 75\" version, and my son has the 65\". We both love it!",

                "reviewText": "TV is great, be cautious ordering such a fragile item to be shipped. Product came unusable with the power connection point inside the TV broken and pushed into the TV. After mounting and powering on the TV would power cycle itself every few seconds making it impossible to navigate any screens to get to settings or diagnostics. Spoke to Amazon support who forwarded me to Samsung to try to get a service rep out to repair the TV. The Samsung rep recommended returning the TV for a replacement seeing as it was new out of the box, the Amazon rep was quick to click back onto the call and inform me they would not offer a replacement but could accept a return and I could purchase the TV again. The Samsung rep then sent me a text informing me that she had been hung up on and if I needed further help from Samsung to reach out to her, she still highly recommended replacing the entire unit. After speaking to the UPS driver who picked up the return he was very clear that boxes that do not fit in shelves are put flat on the floor, my suspicion is the TV was delivered flat and was damaged in shipping from the jarring. Now waiting 2 weeks for Amazon to issue a refund and out the cost of 2 TVs until then..Purchased a replacement at best buy where they beat amazons price, undamaged TV is great! Everyone who sees it sitting in art mode comment on how realistic the paintings look and how great the image is when viewing videos. The smart things app that accompanies the TV can be a little slow and confusing at times but fortunately it isn\u2019t needed often. Highly recommend the Samsung frame, just caution having something so fragile come bouncing down the road to your home out of your control.",

                "reviewText": "Hi - loved what I'd seen of the Frame options before this, and so signed up imediately for the pre-release when I learned about the anti-glare option coming in 2022. I love the bezel (very narrow), the anti-glare LOOKS like it should work great (we have a lot of huge windows in our room, so that was key). it's very thin, seems well made, great custom frame finishes, was well packaged, came fairly quickly, and wasn't too pricey. So - what's not to like ? Well, the whole idea behind paying the extra coin for this model is so that it'll look clean (like a picture on the wall) - yes ? Unfortunately, whoever designed the OneConnect module clearly never used the set. You CANNOT put it inside the wall, either behind or below the panel (it has needed connection ports on 2 perpendicular faces of the box - WHO is the i-dot who thought that could work ? It only comes with a short connection cable even if you DO decide to mount it externally outside the wall (and then it looks dopey since it is ungainly, and VERY poorly thought out needing cables to exit ifrom two perpendicular sides - insane). Want a longer connect cable ? No problem - just pay a ton more for an aftermarket version :-( We hired the top professional in Denver to attempt to dress it all up and make it work. He came over, listened to what we wanted thinking it'd be no problem...looked at what was here...thought and played around for a while...then promptly refunded all of our $ (even the trip charge) telling us that - in his opinion - no matter what he could think of, it was never going to look \"clean\" :-( Another trifling item - WHO is the clown who thought that a storm-trooper white remote control was a good design idea (for something which folks routinely need to pickup and manipulate with their hands) ? Just a gross, fingerprint-showing nightmare to constantly be cleaning, and yet another example of this product NOT having been tested even a little by folks who actually USED it :-o Add in the fact that you can see the electrostatic emitter behind the screen due to the charge massively grabbing dust out of the air around the set (despite having 2 brand new air filters which we installed to scrub the air in an effort to eliminate that issue), as well as the problems referenced in other reviews with displaying your own pics and Samsung trying to make extra bucks selling you online art; and you have just a recipe for a very vexing, disappointing product :-( We WANTED so badly to really like this - it just seems strongly like it wasnt' really ever tested by anyone who actually USED the product for more than an hour or two or in their own home. Overall, I'd have to say - it isn't the WORST...but wait another generation or two until Samsung (who is normally awesome) to actually issue a product with the kinks worked out that is ready for consumer use. As it is - it's WAY better in a store setting than anything you'll actually put onto your wall at home. Just my thoughts - but I did waste a ton of effort and time trying to make it work :-o",
