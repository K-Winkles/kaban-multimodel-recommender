Kudos to the staff for making it quick and hassle-free.As a parent, I appreciate a straightforward tech purchase, and this TV delivered just that. If you\u2019re on the hunt for a reliable and budget-friendly option for your child\u2019s entertainment hub, I highly recommend considering this one.

I also ordered a soundbar which gave me huge issues. At first it didn't work - and then it the soundbar would cut out after a few minutes of having the TV on. Turns out I hadn't bought an HDMI cable in the last five years or so - I was cycling through old, outdated cables and that was my issue. I bought a modern HDMI cable (they aren't all the same) and it works like a dream. I smile when I turn the TV on now because the picture is so clear and I feel like I am actually watching a modern TV!",

                "reviewText": "Being broke means you can't have all the greatest things in life, but that doesn't apply to everything. I've had the pleasure of owning a good 4K tv before, and I've experienced nice big plasma TVs. But for the most part, I've been using small, 720p and 1080p TVs. This TV is an awesome upgrade even if it's not the greatest thing on the planet. I've seen complaints about poor performance in low light, or some other small gripes. But I bought the 50 inch model, and my roommate bought the 43 inch model, and we're both awestruck. The picture quality is fantastic, the audio quality is awesome, and it's not too heavy. Sure the materials aren't top class, but the cost savings have to come from somewhere. I've definitely seen much worse low light performance, and I don't think I've seen a TV get as bright as this one. The refresh rate and latency is definitely good enough for competitive gaming, and once you get the settings figured out, so is the picture quality. I've connected the TV to my Xbox Series S, and set the TV up to run low latency mode and 4K (even though the Series S only supports 1440p). And since I have a 50 inch model, I can comfortably sit back in a recliner while I game and still see everything in the game as if I was face to face with a monitor. Wheather you're watching or playing something, casually or competitively this TV is an absolute steal for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing TV, if you take the time to learn all of its features and set it up correctly. It recently received a software update to the new Home interface, and there seems to be small updates sent practically each week, so I commend the Amazon/Insignia team effort to keep improving it... With the new interface, Fire Apps aren't limited to interlace mode anymore (thank goodness!) - they are progressive mode now! When I turn on the TV, it is smart, like it displays rows of shows or movies I might want to watch or continue watching where I left of (some of Amazon's suggestions make sense, but others do not - you really have to train the TV by watching things). I really like how each of the inputs have their own individual settings. YouTube 360* 4K vids work well also... I was amazed!However, there are still glitches that I HOPE will get solved down the road in future updates... On the new home screen, when you \"remove from watchlist\", it tries but fails to do it... Also, the Crunchyroll anime app does NOT work on this TV - at least until the lazy Crunchy team decides to issue a patch for their broken Fire app (the app has TONS of recent 1 star reviews). Serious anime fans will need to have a PS4/Roku hooked up also.",

                "reviewText": "I have a TV with Fire Stick. I have a TV with Fire TV. I have a TV with Fire TV Cube. The TV with the Fire TV Cube is a Smart TV but the Smart TV features for someone who only uses streaming services over WiFi (No Antenna and No Cable) was not as good as Fire TV. I like Fire TV because I have all my streaming services, and more available, and a format that makes it easy to operate on any of my TVs. The Insignia 65\" FireTV is the best. The single remote, Alexa, \"my watchlist\" works better than any of the previous opetions. The internal operating system is much improved. This TV is in a remote resort location and operates on a 4g signal putting out between 1 mbps and 5 mbps and runs very smooth. I need only one of the 3 HDMI inputs to connect a DVD player. My sound bar connects with one skinny optical wire. Nothing else to do and it was on. Ok Boomer, I connected like a pro! The 4k picture is great. Bought this from Best Buy over Amazon on Prime Day and saved $100.",
