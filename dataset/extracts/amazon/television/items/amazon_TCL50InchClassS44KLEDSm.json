The 43in size is ideal for my coffee corner.It's a Google TV and the setup is kinda straightforward (via Google home on my phone). Satisfying image quality, color vividness and sound quality.",

                "reviewText": "I know most people don't use their TVs flat on a recycled gaming desk frame like this, but this was the use case for this monitor. I needed a 43\" 4K monitor and this TCL Google TV was the perfect one. The biggest feature that this TV has that I like is the fact that you can set it to remember the last input when powering up. As a result, I don't have to switch out of the Smart TV mode in order to get the monitor connected to the Computer. Not all TVs do this and not all TCL TVs do this.As for the display, the picture quality is amazing, I've set it up for low latency, high contrast, and vivid colors. It makes the virtual pinball tables look fantastic. There is no smearing when the ball is moving all over the table, lights flashing, and flippers going wild.Value is great as well. I did WAY too much research on TVs and found this to be a great value for the size, the 4K picture quality, and the 240Hz Motion Rate which helps with the rapidly moving images.Shipping was fast and well done. Packaging is typical for TVs nowadays, slim box with accessories on the top. No damage in shipping, all worked beautifully out of the box.I will definitely be buying this one again for future Pinball Tables.",

That said, it's not bad, it's just not good either.I love Google TV, but they're powering it with a 1990 cell phone processor here. It's slow.Picture is pretty terrible out of the box, but check out the ratings s450g calibration settings guide and adjust the TV accordingly. Absolutely massive difference in picture quality and colors.Speakers are terrible, and for some reason this TV doesn't play nicely with my soundbar so I've been stuck with the TV speakers.All that said though, the price was great, so in all fairness...I'm getting a lot of entertainment for the price so it's worth a 4 star rating.",

It is a very decent TV with a great picture and price, that will give you a good upgrade to 4K if you didn't have 4k before like me. 60 Hz is very good for games and movies, with a Motion Rate 240. NOTE: Motion Rate is not the same as Hertz(A refresh rate) so don't get too excited when you see that in the description.My only advice is when you get the TV adjust the picture to your liking there are many options, so adjust it to the best picture and quality for your eyes.This TV will give you what you need and maybe more, but not what you want. You will need to put in more money to get what you want.",

                "reviewText": "First and LAST TCL purchase I will ever make. Tech support has me factory resetting every issue, of which there are plenty. At this point, I've spent several times more of my time troubleshooting THEIR problems with this TV than I would have at a second job to just buy their whole god-forsaken company and fix them myself. Message to all TCL employees: quit and find some other industry. Please, you are worthless. TV won't turn on sometimes. TV won't turn off using the power button oddly located UNDER the TV. TV doesn't respond to remote if it is physically lower than the TV. Remote has to be re-paired to the TV once a week. TCL-made sound bar takes 10+ minutes to be detected by the TV, unless you power cycle the TV. When the sound bar is finally detected, it's practically FULL VOLUME! TCL app cannot find the TV. Internet sometimes is not detected by the TV. TCL tech support is just as worthless, and I'm now stuck with this junk, due to their unfamiliarity. Their other troubleshooting tips do not apply. Power buttons aren't where they say they are, settings they describe do not exist. Even the HDMI Arc input # is wrong. What a disaster of a company. I could wipe my ass with a square of TP and the randomness of what was presented would be a better design.",

It has a google system and it was super easy to set it up with my preexisting google account. The visuals are beautiful and i'm shocked I could get such a big, 4K TV for less than 300 dollars. There are tons of customization features and automation settings, and voice activation too. I only had one issue and it immediately fixed itself with the first troubleshoot I tried. Also, I was super surprised to see that it gave me hundreds of free channels and programs too! Honestly, my parents paid thousands for their Samsung TV but this one is lowkey better. But I might just be biased \ud83d\ude05. I bought this for my XBOX 1X and the quality is phenominal. This TV has almost every HDR setting available to make gaming as well as other entertainment crystal-clear and vibrant. And it's BUILT IN! Anyways, This TV is an amazing deal for the quality, I cannot recommend it enough!",

This one was substantially slow compared to the Roku ones (we ended up returning this one and got the same exact one but with Roku). This one would have trouble connecting to the internet when turned on (and it was directly connected to our Ethernet cord), and for the first 10-20 seconds of turning a show on the sound was \u201coff\u201d based on the picture. The picture quality also occasionally lagged. The major thing that turned us off of this, as the other things listed would fix itself, was how slow navigating through any menus (choosing an app, and when in an app navigating a show or movie to watch). It was just always behind. If those things don\u2019t bother you, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s an ok choice as the quality of the picture (not the lagging) was nice.",
