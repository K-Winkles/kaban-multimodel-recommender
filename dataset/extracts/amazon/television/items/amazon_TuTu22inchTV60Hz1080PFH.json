(For Blu Ray DVDs, hook up a Blu Ray DVD player.) I recently purchased and returned an Insignia Fire TV, which, I discovered, was designed for use with WiFi, Amazon, etc., with very little accommodation for over-the-aIr TV. The TuTu handles standard over-the-air channels with ease. It instantly picked up 118 channels, as opposed to the 88 I could receive after many attempts on the Insignia Fire with the same excellent 60-mile-range indoor antenna. The TuTu's remote includes a numerical keyboard for specifying the desired channel. It allows full function for your added Blu Ray DVD player and its remote. The TuTu has easy straight-forward setup and controls and a great picture That's the way a TV should function!",

                "reviewText": "My expectations were low, but it's a fine little TV. The only problem is the small sound, as with any flat screen TV these days. Expect to buy a set of speakers. I took my old PC speakers and they work great with the headphone jack and USB power. They'll turn off with the TV power.I was disappointed the TV screen was scratched when received. I buffed it with a soft cloth and reduced the damage and decided to live with it, we wont' notice it afterwhile. There was no damage to the packaging. I must warn anyone wanting to use a Roku streaming stick. There is a box that sticks out of the TV in the back and obstructs anything plugged into the HDMI (see pic). A streaming stick is too long to fit, you'll need to get a pigtail adapter.",
