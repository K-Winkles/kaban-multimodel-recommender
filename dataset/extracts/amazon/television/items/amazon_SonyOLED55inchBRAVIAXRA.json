VRR which is variable refresh rate helps lag, judder and screen tearing for a smoother gaming Iexperience. The Google aspect of it is really interactive with voice control and smooth transition for apps. It overall great choice for movies, gaming, or even surfing the web. I recommend this TV strongly to new sony buyers",

                "reviewText": "The day after mounting this XR-65A75L, I noticed a series of small bubbles in 4 clumps all organized in a horizontal line across the screen about 8 inches from the top. The bubbles seem to be under the outermost layer of the screen. It isn\u2019t noticeable in most viewing conditions, but it is highly evident when the TV is off or during darkly lit scenes or black images. I purchased this expensive television specifically for OLED\u2019s ability to display deep black colors. Now when this television displays any dark scenes, all I see is the series of small defects lined up across the top third of the screen. I sent multiple photos to Sony in order to receive warranty coverage. After a week, Sony engineering determined that this is an acceptable defect and will not fix or replace my unit. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will never buy Sony again. I am just thankful I didn\u2019t waste any money on a Sony sound system. I\u2019ll be happily going back to LG or Samsung for my entertainment system.",

                "reviewText": "I dont typically write product reviews but to help others that are shopping for oled tv, I figured i would provide some info. Between this model and A80L there are few minor differences. One the tv stand is not adjustable like the a80L. Two no built in mic inside the tv. However you can still speak into the remote should you choose to. Three built in sound system is different. This model is two channel set up rather than the 3 channels in the a80l. If you use external sound system this shouldnt be much of an issue. And that is it. Same panel, same processor, same os, and etc.I spent months doing research on which oled tv i should buy and decided to go with sony due to the following reasons. I use my tv primarily for streaming netflix, movies, and etc. I occasionally play ps5 also. I use this tv in a low sunlight environment where brightness isnt too much a factor. With some tweaks color accuracy was superb, along with image processing and up scaling. Honestly this is the reason i ended up with sony over LG. If your primary use is for gaming then i might suggest considering LG as well. Google os is snapy and easy to use unlike what lg and samsung comes with. So far i really enjoyed the tv with my sonos speaker setup and found no issues. With black friday sale approaching i was able to snag this for a good discount hence i strongly suggest for those who want a sony tv with minor sacrifice on thing i listed above.dont hesitate to buy it.",
