                "reviewText": "I bought this tv because my 2024 Freightliner Cascadia came with a tv mount and cable antenna, and this tv fits perfectly on the stock bracket! I bought tv mounting screws separately, and it has survived being on the road very well. It\u2019s also really nice that this tv has an A/V Antenna port so I can use the truck\u2019s antenna to watch cable tv. Otherwise, this tv is perfect for streaming from a phone\u2019s personal hotspot, using an HDMI adapter to connect your phone directly, stream from a laptop, or play video games.This tv is very energy efficient as well, which is very important for being in a truck and powering it off the truck\u2019s battery\u2019s.The picture quality is also really good, and even though it\u2019s 1080P it still has crystal clear quality.The tv also comes with a ton of apps that you can access, and it has Vizio Watch Free+.I would highly recommend this tv to other truck drivers due to it being light weight (about 6 lbs.), cable hookup, energy efficiency, and good quality. This also applies to RV\u2019s as well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good quality tv that I purchased because of it's size. The 24\" set fits nicely into smaller spaces. The picture is great, but the sound is not commensurate with the quality of the set. It has two tiny speakers that face out the back. No matter what adjustments are made, the sound is tinny and low-quality, like an old hand-held transistor radio from yesteryear. I had to purchase a Vizio sound bar and that fixed the sound problem while keeping the overall footprint small enough fit into the limited space I have for the set. I recommend this tv with the caveat that a sound bar is an absolute MUST for this tv. I gave this product 4 stars because without the sound bar, the sound is completely unacceptable.",

But this TV is really lovely. Very sleek looking and feels like quality. The TCL I tried felt like chinzy plastic crap. This Vizio was easy to set up and get my Prime Video hooked in no problem. Also worked using Chromecast from my PC and Apple Play from my phone. I wanted to be able to play exercise videos from my Silversneakers account. This is also the perfect size for my guesthouse. Plus it has a great picture. Sound could be louder. But I will try pairing my Sonos speaker with it. I am super pleased with this purchase.",

Found this TV during Prime Day and this 24\u201d fits perfectly.You will need an HDMI cord to connect to certain devices. I had extras so it wasn\u2019t a problem for me, but definitely add that to your cart if needed.Some complained about the volume being low. After fiddling with the volume settings, I found that if the audio isn\u2019t already set to Virtual X surround sound and volume leveling is set to off, turn it on and the volume increases significantly.The TV has great color under the bright setting.The best part is the microphone on the remote. Makes using the Smart system a breeze.Great value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Sound is adequate.Works with ROKU.Other that that NONE.Cons:No mater how I adjust the color settings, including calibrating, the colors are way off, gray is light purple, white is even lighter purple, when set to warm everything is orange and green. Calibration is a royal pain the posterior, and is useless anyway as it only makes the colors worse.The picture for video is grainy and blurred at the same time, cloudy looking like having cataracts in your eyes, even with a ROKU.The remote is sparse, and the only shortcut buttons are for PAID services, also the home button takes you to a page of PAID movies and services not to the apps you chose to install which are buried in a side menu only accessible by pressing the left side of the D-Pad/Navigation Ring.The GUI is nothing but ads for PAID services at the top of everything making getting to the content you want tedious and messy.I tried all settings and calibrations to no avail all colors remained incorrect!The screen also looks washed out, blurred, and foggy, as well as being pixilated and grainy like a bad CRT TV from the 1980s.Absolutely useless as a PC monitor all text is illegible no matter what settings are in use.Whatever panel Vizio is using in these models it is totally inferior to the older models. I have an older model: D24F-F1 and it has a far superior panel in it than this new model, color is also correct and all text is just as good as it is on my monitor.Vizio also changed the location of the VESA mounting holes moving them 2 inches higher towards the top of the screen making it a mismatch on a dual screen stand, a major deal breaker for me.The selection of so called FREE viewing is pathetic and most of the apps available in the GUI are paid subscriptions only.Conclusion:This is the third brand of newer TV I\u2019ve purchased in a months time, and all have been thoroughly disappointing! I will be returning this one as well and will probably go with a decent monitor of the same size and use an HDMI Hub to switch between a ROKU and a PC.",
