                "reviewText": "I have so many regrets after buying this thing. I'm at the point of just wanting to throw it out the window.1. First, as you can see from the pictures, the picture quality is horrible. The picture is extremely washed out and practically unwatchable. It doesn't matter what picture mode I change it to, it always looks the EXACT same. The funny thing is, that it looks like you would expect when cast against the plain wall, no projector screen. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the way the installers installed the projector, but it's practically impossible to put it on the wrong side as the other side of the projector screen is shiny black. So it's definitely on the correct side.2. The instructions to line the picture up with the screen are very extremely sparse. I still have yet to perfectly align the picture up with the screen. After trying for a week to get it right, I just gave up and settled for some of the picture spilling over to the wall. It's not worth my sanity to keep fiddling around with this thing.3. The unit was supposed to come with TaskRabbit vouchers. Neither one of the voucher codes worked so I ended up paying out of pocket for the TaskRabbit installation. That was an extra $200+4. The customer service is horrible! I called hisense so many times at this point I've lost count. Every time I call, I get someone who knows absolutely zero about the unit and is obviously reading off of a script. After so many calls and emails I finally got them to escalate my issue to \"tier 2\"... They tell you someone will can you back within 24-48 hours. And you better be sitting by your phone the entire time, because if you miss their call, they will not call back. Besides the fact that they refuse to call you a within a time window. You just have to get lucky and catch the call when they call. God forbid you have a life and are busy or have a job and can't take the call. Even if they do call and you're not in front of your TV then you're going to have to contact them again, and set up another call. Then wait another 24-48 hours for a return call. I've missed 3 calls over the course of a week. I've lost so much time on this ridiculous customer service back and forth I can't even give it any more energy.I would like tell anyone who will listen. STAY AWAY FROM HISENSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY.",

                "reviewText": "Hisense claims this is a tv replacement but reality is that it's not. Reflective lighting methods still have a long way to go vs emissive. Who I think would love this, those who plan to use this for a home theater and or simply do not mind an ok picture during the day so as long as it's visible. However, during evening hours, the picture is beautiful and bright. No complaints there. The unit is large, looks like the speaker make the projector larger than it needs to be. It sounds good for it's size but I have a 7.2 system so I don't care for it. The unit needs to be about 1 ft from the wall so it's not an agressive UST. I had to create a slide out table because half of the unit over hung my wall mounted unit. Why the 2 stars then? Well unfortunately the day time viewing compared to claims were disappointing and more critical within a week it started exhibiting a loud electrical noise. I contacted the seller for help, beach Camera, and the seller didn't take ownership and responsibility when contacted, instead the seller told me to contact the manufacturer or they may depending on validating my claims approve a return at the cost of 15% restocking fee $400-$500. What year are we in where customers get punished for buying products in good faith that ends up being defective within 1 week? Therefore, I contacted Hisense and they requested a video of the sound, pictures of the serial and a receipt, not unreasonable but we'll see how they respond.",

                "reviewText": "My 100' Hisense laser tv would be great except there's a constant glare on wall above the screen. It's especially annoying when watching in the dark. I spoke with someone from Hisense today about this problem and he told me that all laser TV's, not just Hisense, have this problem (as if I was the only one who didn't know about this). I told him that this significant weakness of the product should be disclosed to all potential buyers prior to purchase but he didn't seem to care. If this is true, why would anyone buy a laser TV? And why didn't this come up in my extensive research before I purchased the TV? I feel cheated.",
