Absolutely the WORST TV EVER!!The delay after pushing a button is soooo long, that you begin to wonder if you actually pushed it hard enough. Sometimes, you push it again - which TOTALLY CONFUSES THE BLASTED TV!!Sometimes, you wait ...and it EVENTUALLY goes to where you pushed.GOOD HEAVENS, people. THIS TV is AWFUL!DO NOT BUY THIS TV !!!====================Wow, hard to begin on the BAD features of this LG TV.1. S-l-o-w and d-e-l-a-y-e-d response to ANY input; have to wait a few seconds for TV to respond; hard to know if TV is failing or 'thinking' about it :(2. The REMOTE control buttons are ALLLL wrong - with the mute button CENTER of remote (??!!) - NOT convenient or accessible.3. The REMOTE has the \"SLEEP\" button NO WHERE easily accessible - in fact, HARD to access it its location.I wouldn't buy another LG product JUST because of THIS TV and remote.The only reason it got a 2 overall rating (instead of 1) is because it IS a TV - that's it.",
