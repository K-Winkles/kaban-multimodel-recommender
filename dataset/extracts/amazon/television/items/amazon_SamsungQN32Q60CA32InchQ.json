The screen suddenly turned black and the TV shut off and tries to turn back on then turns back off, then turns back on each portion of the cycle lasts about 8 to 10 seconds, but will never come on. I would have to assume the warranty is only for one year , possibly because of a lack of confidence in the product. it was great while itI was working but two years for that kind of money it\u2019s not worth it. Of course I will get another TV as opposed to fixing this and I am quite certain I will not be another Samsung.",
