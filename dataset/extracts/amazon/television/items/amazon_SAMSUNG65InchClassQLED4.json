Called support and they sent a replacement right away and I only had to box the 1st one and send it back in. It's been over a month now with the replacement and it's a phenomenal experience. 120hz refresh rate is a game changer when viewing movies as images are able to be viewed as intended. Picture quality is amazing and very crisp. I don't care for the HDR as we live in an apt. that has some seriously superb naturally lighting that is very difficult to evade with extreme countermeasures. My wife and I have a rewatched so many movies and shows already as it's a new experience vs. a 60 hz refresh rate TV. Very happy with this purchase and hope it holds well for at least 3 years.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this 65\u201d Samsung as part of Amazons Prime Days sale. The TV is great. Very modern and thin with several HDMI ports for accessories. The picture is great and the set up was pretty easy. It didn\u2019t take long to go through the wizard and add all my apps and streaming services. We use DirectTV streaming and the app works great along with all the others. We also purchased a Samsung soundbar with subwoofer and the set up with the TV was super easy and paired immediately. Only giving 4 stars because the delivery was terrible. You set up the delivery date after purchase and it was a week, not Prime. That would have been fine but on my date of delivery (which I needed to work at home for) they didn\u2019t show up and they didn\u2019t even notify me. The next day no communication either! They finally acknowledged they didn\u2019t show up and my next delivery date was almost 10 days later. Took 3 weeks for a Prime delivery, clearly they were just trying to sell TVs but anyway, the product is good. Recommend the Samsung soundbar and sub as well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased the Samsung Q70C 85\" TV from SKG USA, drawn by the promise of 'Used - Like New' condition and the assurance of a full manufacturer's warranty. The claim was that the box had suffered minor damage while the TV remained in perfect condition. No box damaged was noted on arrival. However, within the first 30 days, my expectations were met with disappointment.During a dark room test, the TV, priced at $1700, revealed significant 'clouding' and 'banding' defects. These terms might sound technical, but they simply mean that the screen has uneven patches of brightness ('clouding') and visible lines across the display ('banding'), which are particularly noticeable in darker scenes. For a TV boasting QLED technology, known for its stellar picture quality, this is a surprising and unacceptable issue so early in its lifespan.Despite the TV's impressive color accuracy, smart features, and design, these screen uniformity flaws are a major letdown, suggesting a potential defect that undermines the value of this high-end model. It's disheartening to encounter such problems on a device that's barely a month old and sold as near-perfect.I am reaching out through this review in hopes that SKG USA will honor their sale and address these concerns promptly. I urge potential buyers to consider these quality control issues before making a purchase.The response from the seller and the outcome of this situation will be monitored closely. I believe I would have rated this 5 stars if not for the issues presented in this review.",

Only thing I\u2019ll note is the TV is very thin so picking it up to mount it on a wall makes you feel nervous because you feel you might bend it too much.
