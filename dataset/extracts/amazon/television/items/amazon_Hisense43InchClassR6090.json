                "reviewText": "For the price, it's hard to complain about what you get with this 43\" TV. It has a good picture, a small frame bezel and is very lightweight. It's fast. After setup, it powers on and is usable in about 2 seconds. Also, the Roku unit in the 4K TV models has their best, snappiest hardware so the user interface on this TV is incredibly fast too. I occasionally use my TVs as a secondary PC monitor so I also bought this model over others due to the reviews showing it to be a good PC monitor with low input lag. (I have not tested yet)RE: POOR REVIEWS: I've seen people complaining about Roku charging them $. As a 12 year user of Roku devices, I have no clue what these people are talking about. It's free. As for \"ads\" being shown, just to clarify, it's just ads for more channels/apps to ad, they are occasional tiny little boxes off to the side... it's not like buying a Fire tablet where it has a random ad every time you turn it on. It's just offers to subscribe to Hulu and whatnot.This TV has no bluetooth. People seem to be surprised, so don't be, it isn't there. This is a low price, bare bones 4K tv with a nice interface. Don't expect the moon from it and you should be pleased. Remember, 4K for $250. (!)The remote is just a generic Roku remote. Which means BASIC. Volume is on the side. If you want buttons for picture/sound (etc), you will hate this basic remote. It doesn't feel cheap, but it lacks the 50 buttons you may be used to. I actually like only having a few buttons as I was already running my previous TV from my Roku Stick remote.RE: brand: Hisense is unknown to me until now, but a little research reveals that they bought up Toshiba's TV division and used to be who made what were known as \"Sharp\" TVs until last year (and a lot more if you look), so not some unknown player at all.NOTE: for variable volume out: This TV only delivers a fixed volume from the audio output (optical), so you have to use the 3.5mm \"headphone\" jack if you wish to control external speaker volume with the TV remote. I just ran a 3.5mm-to-RCA cord to my bookshelf 2.1 setup.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I lived in a hotel for a month while we looked for a new home after moving across country. We got used to a 47\" TV in bedroom. So when I set up our new 43\" Hisense, my wife was a little disappointed (even though the one we used to have in the bedroom at the old house was an ancient 35\"). I like it just fine.And I REALLY liked how light it is. Just 18 lbs! For an old guy, this is a big issue. I bought a nice support table/rack for it and hanging it on the top was a breeze. (This is in stark contrast to the trouble I had with my 55\" in the living room that I could hardly pick up).The picture looks great to me and I watch from far enough away (about seven feet) not to be distracted by really fine detail. Color is good. And the sound is decent, too. I bought a small sound bar for it and it is superior - no big surprise there. But it isn't by as much as I expected. I could probably have saved that money.I was a little nervous when I realized the only remote in the box was a ROKU remote. And it took me a while to find the volume control on the side of the remote (though it didn't matter once the sound bar was installed). And that's the only reason I've deducted a star. I couldn't figure out how to get the ROKU remote to control the sound bar. I visited every audio setting I could find on the menu system without luck. I would love to not need the sound bar remote. But I have to do it with my big one downstairs, too. In general the menu offers you all the things you would normally look for on the TV remote. The Source button that I missed turns out not to be an issue at all. There are HDMI port selections available right on the screen, so I can switch from ROKU to my cable box with one click.Overall a great experience for a modest investment.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Roku TV, and I really like the intuitive operation, plus the add-ons and operating features.The picture quality is amazing at 4K UHD, the backlighting is not just the edges, but full Direct lighting. I think that makes the images consistent across the screen, and side angle is very good.I did my research and found for the price this TV had the best of most all options available. Granted, it's not an 8K, and the $1K plus TVs are going to be better, but this Hisense is affordable with great features.That includes newly released options that about a year ago made prices more than 50% higher for the same thing. This TV has additional must-have options for sound systems. I bought a Soundbar with DTS VirtualX Sound and Dolby, ordered the correct HDMI cord, because this unit has the HDMI-Arc port, which requires high-speed HDMI cable for best quality- keep that in mind if you want to hook up a great sound system with HDMI 2.1 or better and be compatible. My cord is 8K HDMI 2.1 Cable 48Gbps. That is important because standard HDMI cables are typically 18Gbps, and your system sound will be disappointing.Overall, this was a great buy, a steal for what it cost compared to similar models with the same options. I love it, and I recommend it for budget-minded people who enjoy movies, gaming, music and streaming videos. 43\" is a great size for smaller rooms, even the kids play room when they haul out the PS5 or XBox.",
