                "reviewText": "Wow! Great TV, great Amazon service, EASY trouble-free delivery, Excellent picture, better-than-expected sound quality, easy menu navigation, built-in-WIFI (yes, it's internet-capable and has its own browser & even an Amazon streaming app). Highly recommended!I call this my husband's own personal Drive-In Movie. He calls it his \"window on the world.\" It was purchased to replace a 7 year old 46\" Samsung that was starting to give up the ghost (it lasted much longer than most LCD TVs) . Rather than repair, hubby decided to replace and he is very, VERY happy with this TV.We were concerned that it might be a bit big for our space (he sits about 12 feet from the TV), but this was absolutely perfect and the extra large size was a boon to us. The setup menu is easier to navigate than on the older models & there's a set of Accessibility options that can help you set up larger fonts and even Voice Guidance on menu options, if you choose.We \"cut the cord\" on cable and satellite many, many years ago and go strictly by a roof antenna for off-the-air network broadcasts & stream with a Roku and a FireTV box. Setup was fairly easy, EXCEPT for some legacy hardware (yes, we still have RCA-only devices here and there). Connecting to an amplifier was a little tricky, until we realized you actually CAN connect a 3.5 mm headset jack to an RCA cable splitter with a $7 accessory. Don't know why, but Samsung didn't seem to know that very valuable piece of information. HOWEVER, once we figured that out on our own, we were able to connect a 1998 era amplifier so hubby can use his favorite headset as needed. If you plan to use a headset with this TV, you'll either need to run it through an amplifier OR get a headset with built-in volume control, because Samsung elected to have its audio-out jack at a set output volume (no software volume control).Screen Resolution and Color are EXCELLENT and the sound quality was much better than I expected, given what other Reviewers had complained about. I guess it depends on your \"Era.\" If you're like me and grew up with the old cathode ray tube TV's, you will have absolutely NO complaint with the deep, resonating sound emanating from this TV--we aren't using any other speakers & we're very pleased with the sound quality.I opted to turn off the \"Smart Hub\" after playing with it a while. To each his own, but we found that the Roku & FireTV displayed streaming video much better than the Samsung app, BUT if you don't have a streaming device, the app would be very valuable. The browser works fine, but it would be a good idea to invest in a Bluetooth keyboard, if you wanted to use it regularly.This model boasts 4 HDMI ports, which was important to us. Delivery was GREAT--scheduling was a snap & our delivery was actually made several hours early, thanks to a scheduling shift (we were called first). The delivery team was A+ and unpacked and setup the TV in record time.Great purchase; most highly recommended!P.S. One other big advantage: Samsung can help troubleshoot your TV setup, should you need it, by accessing it via your WIFI setup, if you so desire. Great perk!-----UPDATE 7/23/16: Still LOVE this TV. As mentioned, my husband occasionally uses a Sennheiser headset with this TV. Here's a very inexpensive \"volume control\" he's now using; he says it works GREAT: Koss VC20 Volume Control ---Have a question about this TV or Amazon's delivery service? Just leave a Comment & I'll be happy to help you, if I can!",

                "reviewText": "Synopsis: I am not a videophile however I want a good picture, color, and little light reflection for my money. After reading this review ([...]) they called the J6300 a good mid-range TV. So I pulled the trigger on the 55 inch TV. I loved it so much that I decided to return it, spend the extra $300 and get the 60 inch TV. Great TV for the money. Works for me, great picture, and more. I would recommend this TV to anyone looking to get a nice TV with SMART TV technoligy but not spend for top of the line 4k, curved, etc.!!! Update 03/24/2016 !!!A message popped up on my Samsung TV that it will no longer support Skype as of June 2, 2016. Thought this piece of information would be relevant especially if purchasing this TV with the idea of using Skype. This would affect my review to a 4.5 stars as oppose to 5 on software, I did want to use Skype on it however a proprietary camera is required. My overall experience with the TV is still 5 stars, love it. If you are looking for a TV that supports Skype all Samsung TV's will not as of June.Review: As mentioned above I am not a huge videophile but I wanted the best for my money on a mid range TV. This Smart TV was worth it. Great picture, great color, enjoy the Netflix, Amazon, Pandora, and other apps. The J6300 DOES have the option for Skype however you need to purchase the Samsung Camera. I tried plugging in my Microsoft camera but it kept asking for the Samsung camera by the specific model number. No issues for me there, I'll just continue to use my computer.The color is good, the picture is good, and you can turn off the \"Soap Opera\" effect although I don't know what the settings are just Google \"Samsung J6300 turn off Soap Opera effect\" (Is it affect or effect? lol)Yes there is reflection on the screen so if you have a light behind you or a very bright room you'll need to angle it right. I have no problem viewing this TV in the day time, I just moved the TV in a way where the windows are not behind me. I do have a lamp behind me but I can easily move it.The sound is okay. I feel any TV nowadays have such small speakers that you are not going to get the best quality sound. Let me put it this way. If it's normal sound level in the house, it's okay. But as soon as people talk at a normal level or loud activity goes on I need to pump it up above \"50\". At that point I can hear but it's not 100% clear. Again I'm not looking for the best viewing experience, surround sound, etc. I would like to get the Samsung Speakers but at this point want to spend my money elsewhere. The speakers in the TV are do-able. Again for a mid-range, well worth it.The size is a bit deceiving. It's amazingly small for it's size. I think it's the very skinny profile and borders. Sitting about 7-8 ft back from my TV the 60 inch is perfect. The 55 inch just seemed a little small for the size of the room.The shipping was awesome!! It was wrapped well in extra Styrofoam an no cracks or problems with the picture. Everything was good.On returning the 55 inch for the 60 inch Amazon was extremely helpful. There was no re-stocking fee (I called them within 3 days of getting the first TV), no shipping fee or anything. They refunded my card that day, coordinated a pick up, and then I went online and purchased the 60 inch TV. So my experience here was excellent.I originally paid 1300 for the TV and on Nov 23 2015 the price dropped $450 US (within the 30 day window or price matching). Again Amazon came through and refunded me the difference plus tax.Con: I get light reflection from the lamp behind me... I really need to move it, it's been a month. hahaha Seriously the only cons are: 1. Yes there is light reflection however I have the lamp directly behind me. 2. The speakers are a bit hard to hear with a lot of ambient noise. Let's put it this way, I don't think you could have a Super Bowl Party with the standard TV speakers and hear everything over crowd noise. At that point though I think you would have some sort of sound system.**Update 12.21.2015**I moved and have the TV in an area where the lamp is not behind me. Looks even better. Great TV for the money. Glad I got it.",
