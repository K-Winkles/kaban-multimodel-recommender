The built in speakers remind me of the tv's from back in the 50's with that sort of you're in one room and it's in another. I beleive that is because everything I use I added a surround sound system too. In fact for this tv I bought the Samsung Q800C soundbar and now it sounds outstanding. I did have an issue with the built in Alexa. Even after using Support it did not work. I have to use Bixby. That worked instantly. Other than that it suits my purpose and I'm finding refurbished to be as good as New other than the Warranty.",

                "reviewText": "Three issues: The TV arrived 8 days later than the latest date promised. The picture often is only 1/3 of the total screen, and nothing can fix it. Third, the TV goes off and on at will, and won\u2019t come on again until it decides to, most recently in the middle of the night. I contacted Amazon and they are making me deal with the company that delivered it ( late); it\u2019s a complicated process. I learned that Amazon doesn\u2019t take responsibility for refurbished products until all else fails AND it still has to be within 30 days. I can\u2019t believe others have the same TV 5 stars. Mine is defective. Don\u2019t buy this; too risky for saving $104.",
