At first glance, it seems like a gimmick (and maybe it is), but for certain situations and needs, it definitely fills a need. First of all, the picture AND sound quality is spectacular. The picture performs just as well as near any current leading display and the sound is fantastic, as the floor mount doubles as a speaker with some actually booming sound with the built in subwoofer.Now, on the main feature of the rotating screen. This works best with rooms/homes that need to prioritize and maximize available space. I think this works best in a bedroom or small living room setup where it can turn vertical to save space and act as a digital clock or even artwork or slideshow display and when you need it, it\u2019ll rotate to widescreen for whatever you\u2019re watching. I think this is the real use over any kind of social media app gimmicks.Bottom line, if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019ll save space and has great sound/picture quality, this is a great pick.",

                "reviewText": "This was a stroke of genius from Samsung - a smart 4K TV that can easily adapt to the gajillion applications one can cast from their phone without losing screen size of quality where applicable. This TV can do and does everything our other smart TV's provide, and because of the optional wheels, this unit can be maneuvered into rooms where there is either not a constant need for a TV or no real space to mount or have a TV stand. Just a great idea! That said, what is preventing me from giving this unit a 5-star review? Two things, and they may not apply to everyone, but the stand of the TV is just a bit low. About 6 inches too low. If you have couches, arm chairs, or other standard sized furniture, there is a possibility of impeded sight lines. The other is the cord is woefully short for being praised as a portable type unit (wheeled from place to place or room to room). Because of a few of our rooms we wheel this to have outlets that are not in the most optimal position for where we want this tv, we need an extension cord. Not the end of the world on both counts, and we have a few work-arounds, but wanted to share. All-in-all, a tremendous TV.",

                "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars Cool concept, flawed software and integration, false advertisement",
                "reviewText": "First of all The Sero concept is very interesting because not only the TV occupies little space, it also does not require to be mounted on a wall or standing on top of a media console. Also, it comes with AppleTV embedded on it, as well as all the apps you may probably need such as Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Sling, PlutoTV, YouTube, Spectrum, etc. You basically will not need to connect anything to the HDMI ports, just the power plug and that's it (unless you still use your DVD or want to hook up a gaming console). Therefore this new concept of \"apps-only generated content\" makes this TV very easy to install, but at the same given its form factor Samsung should have added mobility to it, for instance, two rear or front wheels so that we could move it to another conference room by just tilting the TV and pushing it. Without this mobility, the TV is extremely heavy therefore hard to transport.In terms of functionality and integration, the Samsung Smart software is designed for Samsung phones only. For example, you can't use your iPhone keyboard to enter text while using the AppleTV app (which is possible when you use an AppleTV box), so you still need to use the Samsung remote control and select letter by letter on the screen like in the old days, a show-stopper to me. Indeed, the iPhone Remote app won't control your AppleTV on the Samsung. Also, forget about AirPlaying in portrait mode using an iPhone, it only works with Samsung phones. And the \"tap your phone\" feature you see in the videos? For Samsung phones only!Summarizing, this is a compact TV, nevertheless very heavy and with no mobility although its design may suggest otherwise. All the features announced by Samsung are for Samsung phone users, so don't get mislead by their false advertisement and lack of full disclosure.And no, I am not returning it because it's so heavy and hard to repack that I just live with it, but it's certain I'll never buy a Samsung product ever again.",
