                "reviewText": "Bought this tv June 2016 the screen went completely black on Saturday feb 4, 2017. THE DAY BEFORE THE SUPERBOWL. Today is feb,8th and I again had to call Samsung and ask when will my tv be repaired. Again I was told I will get a call in the next 48 hours to schedule my service. I have done the online chat, I have emailed, and I have called on the telephone. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.... I would expect a $5000.00 tv to last longer than a few months and I certainly expect much better customer service. If you are buying a tv and its a toss up between Samsung and another maker. Pick the other maker.Update: April 5th. Samsung picked up my TV today, because they don't have a certified tech in my area. I now have the choice of a refurbished TV or a refund. Chose the refund, after many calls. I was told the check would be mailed after the condition of the tv was verified. The worst customer service I have ever experienced !",

Really enjoying it and no service or picture issues at all. Recommendation is to ensure you are getting the correct panel edition, as they make the \"demo\" version (Costco) and the real quality version. TS01, TH01 or a TH02 version Panels are what you want for best picture quality.",
