I found it odd that this model was cheaper then the TCL 2017 \u201c55 inch for $100 more sold by another seller on Amazon. So I compared both TVs on another site stats wise and found both were exactly the same. I took a chance and saved $. TV arrived in three days. Box was in perfect condition along with Television. Quality of screen 10. Sound 10. Plays my ps4 pro like a boss. TV is super light for it\u2019s size. Came with one remote with easy controls. I added LED lights to the back of mine and damn it looks good. No weird spots or shadows on screen like some reviews had reported on other size TCL\u2019s. I\u2019m adding a sound bar soon but not because it needs it. I hadn\u2019t heard of TCL before but I\u2019m VERY happy with my purchase and plan on buying two more soon.",

                "reviewText": "Buyer beware:After doing a lot of research and being a very tech savvy person (however with minimal budget for things I'd really like!) I was so pumped to find this TV. Not only did it great great reviews from 3rd party individuals, shows, blogs webcasts etc, but everyone was always blown away by the picture at this price! I completely agreed. Having 4K, HDR and a 55-inch TV in my living room that was beautiful for this price was absolutely incredible. No serious complaints that would outweigh the value for money here on the WORKING TV.However beware. Perhaps why it is able to be so inexpensive.. The picture on my TV has cut out approximately 1.5 years after purchase... That is not the life span of a TV you invest in. Not even close. Surprise, surprise the limited warranty is 1 year. When buying a TV I am putting in that much research and time to consider the value and the quality. It is a fair chunk of money and I want to make sure I'm happy with the product for what is assumed to be a number or years AT LEAST. Obviously after searching online it was not hard to see that I was not alone and many people, youtubers and even sites sell replacement boards etc, as it is a known issue. I suppose to some extent that is the risk you take when going with a brand that is new and \"upcoming and getting stronger in the market\" (as reviewers said - one of the reasons I felt comforted in the brand being new).It's a great TV but just be careful. Sometimes that cost-quality ratio can get you a lemon and that lemon can be end up being the same price as buying a MUCH more expensive TV from the start...",
