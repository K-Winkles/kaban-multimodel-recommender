                "reviewText": "I did much research before pulling the trigger on a new RV television, There are not many options in this realm, I needed it to be a Smart TV, and most importantly to me I needed to be able to have it connect to the Onboard Stereo System in the Camper. This is how this TV sets itself apart from the competition. The Stereo Audio Out Function is capable to Integrate with the Onboard Kenwood Stereo, allowing me to use the balance function of the stereo to put more sound to the passenger on the second bed and not have the TV blaring from the back of the unit into the upper sleeping quarters on a 2021 Artic Fox Truck Camper. Now we can all hear it at the levels we want even when the AC unit is blasting. Picture is Great, Set-up is a cinch, Remote is your standard smart remote similar to a Samsung, Even has a Sleep Timer! Delivery came quick, and after install I had questions about the unit and reached out to support and they were more than prompt and helpful to address any problems and quick to offer resolution. Very happy with customer support and my purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone in the RV world looking to upgrade their Television.",

                "reviewText": "I had problems setting this up to connect with my cable service and it took a dozen calls and 24 hours before anyone answered my call. Further, the phone number for support in all their literature is incorrect, and I was only able to get the call to be answered at all was via email. If it had not been for my son coming to my rescue, I'd still be waiting for further help because they asked me to send pictures so they could visualize the back of their TV and my cable box that I was trying to connect to. Picture and sound appear to be just fine, but don't expect a responsive support department (which is likely from another country). The support is the main reason I gave this only one star as I was ready to send this back just waiting to reach someone in support.",

My old TV, which an insignia flat screen that's almost 15 years old, with the same antenna and in the same area gets twice as many channels. The speakers in this TV have a very tin sound. It sounds like they are just tweeters. My biggest issue with this TV is the input ports are recessed which means it's hard to plug things in and it's impossible to plug in a streaming stick unless it's pigtailed. So no antenna TV and no smart TV and my only options when boondocking are DVDs that are becoming harder to find even at the dollar store. Another thing is the build quality is lacking. bezel came undone a little bit in shipping and doesn't want to go back together buts it's subtle and not very noticeable so it's not a huge deal, but it just feels like cheap hard plastic. Overall this TV is kind of meh... If it wasn't 12v I wouldn't keep it.",
