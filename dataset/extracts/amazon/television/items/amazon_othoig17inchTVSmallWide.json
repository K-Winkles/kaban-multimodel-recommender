                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars TV in this small factor delivers picture quality at this price!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We currently have 2 televisions in our home - one that is majorly used in the living area and the other for the guest room, however, both are permanently hooked over the wall. My wife and I really missed a portable TV that can be used in the kitchen while we cook or when we go camping. Obviously, for the later use, there is a need to be a digital ATSC Tuner and so this TV has one. I do really wish these had Bluetooth inbuilt to connect to Bluetooth speakers but still, this TV in small factor is good enough for our needs and I would recommend it.Here is my take after extensively using it for a week:Pros:- Picture quality is decent enough to watch videos/movies or any playback needs. Supports 1440x900 resolution at max. But since the TV size is 17\", these feel good enough. Refer to my attached pictures- Colors are vibrant & it has good wide-angle coverage too- Speakers are loud enough for short distant viewing needs. Double firing speakers with 0.8W throughput capacity each- Both AC and DC powering capability to make it versatile for home or caravan/camping needs- Digital HDTV signal supported by this TV with ATSC tuner inbuilt and hence great for camping/caravan needs. ATSC frequency is 54MHz~803MHz while NTSC frequency is 55.25MHz~801.25MHz- Audio IN/OUT port inbuilt for connecting external audio devices- Has 1 HDMI port for external connectivity and does has 1 USB port too- Remote comes in very handily to change TV settings- 2 bracket options are inbuilt in this TV and the stand is removable- Tilt degrees are supported by this TV stand & it is controlled by a rotary screw- The monitor is mountable as well- Good build quality with a nice finish- Control buttons are at the front and that is very convenient compared to having them at the bottom of the frame- Car power cable is included in the package- For the features and functionality, these seem to be very reasonably priced in the competition- Detailed manual provided with all the instructions- Comes well packed and there was no damage during shippingCons:- It does not have a very high-resolution picture quality like a 4K TV does, so don't expect a magical video playback. You might feel the picture a little grainy many times depending on the room lighting condition- I really miss the 2nd HDMI and USB port in these. For my scenario, the FireTV stick is connected using HDMI and USB for powering them, hence I can't put any other device to the TV, be it a USB memory drive or any Bluetooth adapter- Speakers are loud enough for this size, however, they sometimes break sound when cranked up to 100%- The stand is not very sturdy. It is light and easily moves if you touch it. However, a double-sided tape is pre-installed at the bottom if you want to use it and permanently fix it anywhere- Remote control works great but it needs to be pointed very specifically to the bottom area of the TV",

Could not get the pedestal to hold, so just used the metal holder to support it. It works well with Spectrum cable, however, is not compatible with their remote. So you end up with two. The sound is not the best because the speakers are in the back and they are tinny. Otherwise is good for the price.",
