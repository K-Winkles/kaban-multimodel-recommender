                "reviewText": "After two previous attempts at replacing a tired but terrific 14 year old big screen Toshiba, I found a TV I like. The QLED display is bright, colors are crisp, and black is very black. There is also a good deal of adjustment available for fine tuning.The sound is also very good, although a sound bar in next to take advantage of the TV's Dolby Atmos/IMAX Enhanced capability.I am not a serious gamer, but I do play local games with a PlayStation, and that works well; no blurry motion, no slow response. The TV does have a 144Hz Game Mode Pro port. I also have a digital antenna for local broadcast and that works well. In addition to the RJ45 LAN connector, there is composite input and 4 HDMI ports and 2 USB Ports. The TV supports Bluetooth, Ethernet, HDMI, USB, and Wi-Fi connectivity.TV set up is easy and well guided. The only thing that took time was getting my brain to think Google, rather than it predecessor's Roku. If it turns out I don't like Google, I can reset the TV to eliminate Google and go back to Roku. I don't think that will be necessary or desired.I was worried about condition on delivery, especially the potential of a damaged screen, based on some reviews. It arrived UPS, front porch, with the shipping carton in perfect condition. It was light enough to be lifted and moved around and unpacked by one person.I'm 78 years old, and the unboxing process was easy. I did need a second person to help lift the TV onto its stand, because of the display needs to be handled carefully, and because of the TV's unwieldy size.One additional note on use of Roku. I am partial to Roku, probably because of prior use. I plugged a 4k Ultra version into an HTMI, paired the remote to the TV and now I can watch with the Google platform using the TV remote, or switch to HDMI Port 2 and use the Roku remote and platform. The standalone Roku unit takes the load off of the TV CPU used by Google, making Roku much faster.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As you can see in the pics, we have a very large living room in our remodeled church. I mounted the TV to a rolling stand and added a sound bar. The bass from the sound bar is much better than the stock speakers. In both cases I find spoken audio to be cloudy and indistinct. I need to mess with settings and see what I can do to clear the speech up. The first couple of weeks, we found that Amazon video was always lagging, stuttering, and caching. I almost sent it back, but didn't want the hassle. Its been a couple months now and the caching hasn't been a problem, so I guess it just got better some how. Picture is good. Interface is good. Pretty happy overall. I'd say it was a good value.",

                "reviewText": "I'm upgrading from a Hisense 70\" H65 I purchased a few years ago. I went with the 55\" option just because it better fit the living room and had less weight. I'm going to base my review on the older TV.I also did get this TV when it was just below $400 before tax as a Black Friday/Christmas deal.Pros- MiniLED truly does make a difference, and with the technology combination that Hisense dubs as ULED, it does compare somewhat to more expensive OLED screens. It gets BRIGHT.- The speakers are impressive for a TV in this price range. Soundbars will always be better, but you won't feel the need to rush out and get one.- With the right cable, modern game consoles will output the HDR10+ and Dolby Atmos features.- This TV allows you to set it up as a 'Basic TV' instead of being forced to add a Google Account, which is a huge plus for me. No unwanted ads or app recommendations is always a pro these days.Cons- Trying to set up 'enhanced mode' on the HDMI in order for HDR features to work was a hassle and wasn't apparent on how to do so without reading up online.- Although I won't use the TV for its smart features, 8GB of internal storage is abysmal.- When watching videos on consoles or AppleTV box, the TV has to readjust to Dolby Vision/HDR in between ads on apps like YouTube and Hulu. A very minor annoyance, but a con none the less.Overall, if you've never had an OLED TV in your life, or had the bare basic 4K budget TVs, this TV is quite something to behold- even from within the same brand! I broke this TV in watching Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse to put it through its paces, (colors, brightness shift from intense scenes and quieter ones, etc).. The H65 couldn't keep up.I'll keep this TV for as long as it works.",
