                "reviewText": "The high resolution picture quality is great - better than any other under-counter TV we\u2019ve ever had. The screen pivots up into the electronics \u2018box\u2019 to keep it out of the way when not using - a nice feature. It also swivels enough to view while sitting at the counter or cooking. Since it\u2019s a \u2018smart\u2019 TV, there\u2019s no cable connection if you have WiFi. This really cleans up the space under the cabinets and allows for the use of Netflix, YouTube, etc. The customer service desk was very responsive and helpful at getting me through a couple of small issues.",

Touch Remote is difficult as one has to push buttons repeatedly for it to register.Would not recommend it.Our return window expired before we could get installed so we are out of luck.Also emailed service for replacement remote - service return email not responsive yet.Maybe this one tv is a fluke but buyer beware.9/5/23 Update:The Sylvox Company responded favorably to my complaint. I explained the \u201ctinney\u201d sound and they offered to send out a replacement which they did rather quickly after we talked. The sound on the replacement was much much better. More depth and more color to the sound. The first one was clearly defective. Tau a representative called to inquire if the problem was resolved and I told her it was. They will mail out a paid return label. I was quit surprised by the responsiveness of the company. I naturally changed my rating to 5 stars from original 1 star.I will add that unfortunately with Amazon one can only resort to 1 star rating to call attention to a problem. I\u2019m very comfortable and deeply appreciative of Sylvox\u2019s resolution of our \u201cbad luck\u201d with the initial TV.",
