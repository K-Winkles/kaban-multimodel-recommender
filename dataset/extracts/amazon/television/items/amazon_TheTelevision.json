Even Hieronymus Bosch would be impressed by the perversely absurd, transgressive tableau on display in these pages. I hope this wins the Splatterpunk Award for Best Novel of the Year. It deserves that much recognition (and a hell of a lot more, in fact).",

                "reviewText": "I've read Edward Lee before and he never failed to put together a truly disgusting story. This one is no different...even taking it to new levels. Satanic worship, torture, sex, and death fill the pages. Mr. Lee culled most of the material from atrocities performed all through history, with some described from a 3rd person perspective, while others were 1st person. A television, that basically only shows Satan's greatest hits is the focal point of this story. The power of sullied blood and the vision of one human power the television...it's his inheritance...his bloodline. Though disjointed and repetitive a few times, overall, Mr. Lee still has what makes him one of the greatest in extreme horror writing.",

                "reviewText": "\"The Television\" by Edward Lee.Mr. I. W. Farthing leads a rather simplistic life. That is, until his estranged Uncle Eldred dies and I.W. suddenly inherits his whole estate. The only catch is that he must relocate from America to England and inhabit the home his uncle once lived in. Upon investigation I.W. heavily questions if he can make this work, as England is nothing like America. But after some thought and exploration he comes around and happily calls England his new home. The only thing prohibiting him from really enjoying this new life of his is the television in the back room. There's no power cord, no nob, no way to physically turn the television on but that doesn't stop it from coming to life anyways and playing the worst human atrocities across its screen for I.W. to see. It appears that Uncle Eldred had many secrets to keep...This story is most definitely not for the faint of heart or easily triggered. Inside these pages lie stories of men's arms being chopped off with machetes, children being murdered by bayonets and fed to pythons, pregnant women being set on fire while bound... just to name a few.This book is incredibly brutal but it's definitely not as brutal as I was expecting. The twist also came out of left field for me and I have to be honest and say I just didn't care much for it. It does tie the book together but I lost a lot of interest in the story after that moment. I found myself really having to push through. Despite that, the story is well written and the descriptions are incredibly easy to envision. The actual ending also hit me in all the feels when I learned of my favorite characters demise.",

Certain things were almost too much because I HAVE read about the Holocaust and Rwanda and many serial killers. He did a fantastic job with this book and the ending was perfect!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommended for veteran horror readers of the extreme kind",
                "reviewText": "Jon Athan, one of the masters of extreme horror, once wrote a book about a friendly television set that could give the kind of advice to a teenager that would corrupt him to the point of no return. Ed Lee' s television is neither friendly, nor does it speak - it doesn't need a power cord, even! Lee, THE master of splatterpunk, writes about a television that only shows. It shows horrible things, indeed. Described clinically, the incidents are the worst kind of atrocities perpetrated on man by man, from ancient Rome to current Ukraine. The book has some extraordinarily brutal moments, and pulls no punches when it comes to children, pregnant women, and old people. What ties everything together is a rather elementary supernatural plotline that, unfortunately, does not really go anywhere; that said, the story needs some such background since plotwise it's incredibly simple. Gross moral corruption oozes all over the pages, and if you've already read some Lee, you know how this combines with a gallery of unusual sexual acts that complement the gore without losing sight of the story. Highly recommended for veteran horror readers of the extreme kind, who will also pick up the Easter eggs and the nods to well-known names.",

Dudes masterbating, S&M, lots of kinky stuff. And that isn't my thing.I read the sample which was promising so I bought the book but by the end of the third chapter, honestly, I was bored and wondered how much more kinky sex I was going to have to wade through to get to any kind of supernatural elements. So I returned it.I can't give an opinion on whether the writing and other elements are good or not. I actually found all the kinky sex and detailed descriptions tedious.If you love detailed descriptions of kinky sex and violence you'll probably love this book. If you're looking for a more straightforward supernatural thriller, you'll probably be disappointed.",
