                "reviewText": "The Sony in my living room broke and The Lady can't go long without her reality TV. So I replaced it with the 75\" QM8.I read and saw the great reviews of this TV but I wasn't ready for just how good this TV is. Now, you have to take some time to get the brightness, color saturation and black level where you want (stick to movie for SDR and HDR and Dolby Vision bright for Dolby Vision). But once you do, this is what I notice:The black levels are OLED quality. I have the LG-C1 83\" OLED in my theater room, and the QM8 is easily a match picture wise. But since the QM8 gets so bright, the specular highlights in HDR dwarfs what an OLED can do.The one flaw it has is the judder in *some* fast moving content. The upscaling of really old content is that great either. But modern tv looks great and anything 1080p and up looks SPECTACULAR. Love the TV so much I ordered the 98\" for my theater room to replace the LG. It's that good!",

Once I got it and tested everything out for myself...everything I've watched is very good except for dolby vision. It is dark and when I adjust it to the brightest for dolby vision it is not even watchable and I regret replacing my Vizio Oled for this. I can't even watch Disney plus cuz everything is dark. I should of got the hisense UK8 or just went all out and got an LG or Sony.UPDATE: 11-21-23Tv is actually a lot better after some calibrations I got online. Dolby Vision is better and hdr and hdr10 is excellent. Very bright tv and just good on dolby. I give thr tv 4 stars",

The TV is amazing and comes with a easy to use remote, if you want you can work on the settings and it looks great straight out the box and the internal sound is very good. Great screen in any light and amazing in dark room all the blacks are vibrant and clear. I would by another one if I had need for one.",

                "reviewText": "There were alot of misses here. So the Tv was ordered on June 25 and originally scheduled for delivery on 6/30. I received a call an hour before delivery and they informed me the tv arrived late to the warehouse and all delivery trucks already went out that morning and I had to reschedule delivery for 7/1. On 7/1 Amazon delivered and setup the 75\u201d QM8 tv. Once they left I moved the tv gently against the wall on my tv stand and the tv\u2019s backlight started to flicker on and off which each slight movement as if something was loose in the tv. When the back of the tv\u2019 plastic cover (above rear subwoofer) was slightly tapped the backlight will go off and on. We ensured the tvs firmware was updated. The whole day of testing the tv regardless of what\u2019s on the screen the tv would randomly flicker off for a half second and then back on with nothing but the power cable plugged into the tv. Later that same evening the flickering got worst until the backlight went completely out. We tried typical troubleshooting like power cycling and removing all hdmi cables and still nothing. As the backlight was out we could still see the faint text on the tv while it was powered on. (See my picture)Although the tv had phenomenal picture quality like inky OLED blacks and ultra bright whites which was expected from all the review sites I follow (Digital Trends, FOMO), I am disappointed as this is my first TCL tv. I hope this not an expected experience of TCL. Not sure the cause but the ball was dropped from manufacturing to delivery. That evening I called Amazon to request an exchange as I love the tv however they could only process it as a return and they couldn\u2019t refund the money back to my credit card. They would only refund my purchase as an Amazon credit.On 7/5 The tv was picked up per Amazon and still awaiting my return status to update.I haven\u2019t heard any reports from anyone regarding QM8 with a bad backlight and random flickering.I will give TCL one more shot as this TV was everything I was looking for coming from a 1080p Samsung that was a solid workhorse for over 12 years. Hope the second time is a charm.",

It is a fantastic TV and I would highly recommend. The color accuracy and upscaling is amazing! I will say though with Roku, which is our primary method of viewing, it only offers the IQ settings out of the gate. And even the bright is dim at times. Not enough for me to deduct a star though.",
