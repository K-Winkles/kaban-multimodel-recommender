                "reviewText": "I love this thing.Not sure if Amazon is still selling these, but I\u2019m glad that I got one right before it was listed as Currently Unavailable.To keep it simple, I purchased one to use as a computer display and it works great. Great picture quality, nice interface, and it\u2019s feature-laden, with all kinds of apps. I use it as a computer display, but it doubles as a TV. It\u2019s a win-win.If I had a complaint, it would be that the remote isn\u2019t backlit, or at least had glow in the dark buttons. There are a lot of buttons on the remote and in the dark, it can be hard to differentiate between what is what. Not a big deal for me because I\u2019m not using it primarily as a TV, but it is something to note. Also, the app system that LG uses to control the TV through the app requires you to provide your location and leave your location services on, which I\u2019m not very fond of. It\u2019s for that very reason that I don\u2019t use it.Other than that, it\u2019s overall a great television and I\u2019d definitely recommend it. If I had a need for another one, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy it.",
