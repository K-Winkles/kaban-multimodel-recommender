                "reviewText": "Purchased at a discount through Amazon warehouse , and I\u2019m a very pleased with it . Aesthetically looks great and is slim. Looks more expensive than it was . The white color and the back design and pedestal look look great .Utilizing the smart features for entertainment features is great , it has access to all the major streaming apps and the included remote makes it easy to navigate and select what you need . The layout is very familiar if you have a Samsung tv, if not it\u2019s easy to get used to quickly . This makes a great monitor and a tv for a bedroom which is where mine is located .The resolution is 4k so watching movies , 4k YouTube videos etc look great . It is an LCD so keep in mind a direct view is the best view if it is off axis the colors will look more washed out . The black levels are decent . The sound quality is ok it\u2019s fairly tinny soundingThe lack of connections on the back is a downer it has a micro hdmi and a usb-c connection so if you add a soundbar would recommend Bluetooth so it won\u2019t take up an input .I use this as the monitor for my Mac mini and the display is great font is easy to read , web pages look sharp . The included webcam is ok but better off buying a better one .I can\u2019t complain overall, got it at a great price , it\u2019s very effective as a media center and desktop monitor for the same price as some 32 inch 4k tv\u2019s . Excellent product .",

                "reviewText": "Bought two of these when I bought a Mac Studio and I have zero regrets. It is connected to the Mac through the USB C port and works like a charm.I use these daily as computer monitors for basic computing, use them after work for gaming and streaming movies and TV as well and we use them as we edit videos and pictures. The colors are crisp, true, and vibrant.I let them go into hibernation when I lock my screen when I am done working on the computer and they are then instant on with just a touch of the mouse or keyboard.I don't like the built-in speakers but of course I had no expectation to like them. I did expect to like the add on webcam but not so much, i just use my iPhone and have tossed those in a drawer.The SmartTV features are solid and work as expected, we use it daily for that as well.I have tried the remote connection to another computer right from the SmartMonitor, it works but isn't something I would use a ton.I do want to try gaming on it but I am still exploring the gaming on the Mac Studio to really get into that part yet.Overall I think this is a great value and would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great Modern PC Monitor that functions as a TV as well - Great Price for what it offers",
                "reviewText": "I bought the new 2023 Samsung M80C Monitor 32-inch version after seeing it on an Amazon Early Black Friday Sale for $400.This is a great value monitor for the price, which is excellent for multi-tasking and functions both as a PC and TV, is capable of 4K, and reaches fairly bright levels with 400 cd/m2 nits of brightness that get realized once you change the picture settings to the dynamic & entertain mode.I was originally in the market for the 27-inch monitor, but surprisingly, that smaller version was $250 more expensive than the 32 inch one and went with this one instead solely because of the price.The TV has built-in Samsung Tizen OS and it works surprisingly really well and it is fairly snappy and responsive. If you have Samsung Appliances in your kitchen like I do, the Samsung SmartThings application will give you neat notifications when your dishwasher or microwave is finished washing or cooking. If you're invested in the Samsung Smart \"Ecosystem\", this is a particularly great buy. It\u2019s pretty cool and future tech/smart house oriented.The Built-In Microsoft 365 platform is definitely gimmicky as it's super slow and virtually unworkable but the Streaming TV apps like Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Disney, Paramount, Apple TV etc. work fine and great. Apple Airplay 2 also works great with negligible latency on my Wi-Fi Network.My only \u201cnegative\u201d nitpicks is that I wish this had a 120hz refresh rate for further future-proofing but it's really not that noticeable when you're doing everyday productivity tasks like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and E-Mail. Another downside is that the SlimFit Camera works fine (when it works) but sometimes you have to detach the magnetic holder for a second and reattach it so that it shows up on your PC's options for Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, or WhatsApp calls etc. The Camera's implementation could have been a little better....I will say it's workable but can be a minor nuisance. Do I think it's the worst thing in the world as some comments have? No, the negativity is overblown. The quality of camera is decent as far webcameras go per visuals and microphone quality, don't expect anything out of this world. It's neither bad or good. Finally, the Built-In speakers are blah. They get the job done in a pinch but I'll probably supplement them with something robust down the road. Please note that there is no 3.5 mm audio jack on the monitor so \u201ctraditional\u201d external PC speakers won't work.Back to some Positives:It also has built-in 65W USB-C charging for a laptop, so that's very convenient! There is a total of 1 HDMI Port, 2 USB-A Ports, and 1 USB-C Port built-in the monitor\u2019s rear. The 2 USB-A Ports become \u201chubs\u201d for your PC if you\u2019re connected via USB-C.The design itself is super clean and modern, usually you pay a serious premium for a design like this in a monitor so kudos to Samsung for making this middle-class attainable lol. For what it is, what it does, and its price, it's definitely a win and keeper for me. It's a unique product in a world of run-of-the-mill standard PC monitors!Update After 2 Weeks:The USB-C Port on the monitor\u2019s rear can carry both charging *and* video signal which means that if you\u2019re connecting via USB-C, you do not need to use the HDMI port for visuals. Additionally, the USB-C cable supplied with the box is surprisingly speedily robust even though it\u2019s not \u201cThunderbolt 3 or 4\u201d certified. I\u2019m using it with a 13th Generation Intel i5 Laptop and 10th generation Apple iPad and it\u2019s working fantastic.***Important***Finally, the Monitor also works really well and seamlessly with Samsung TV Soundbars from 2022 and 2023.The HDMI port on the monitor is an HDMI-ARC capable port even though it isn't specifically labeled as such (which was and is a major oversight on Samsung's Part) \u2013 this wasn\u2019t written anywhere in the manual or any documents I could find online on their website so imagine my pleasant surprise when I took the chance to hook up a Soundbar I bought during Black Friday 2023 via the monitor\u2019s rear HDMI port and connected it to the HDMI-ARC opening port on a Samsung S61B Soundbar to find that that soundbar worked and integrated right away with the monitor\u2019s Tizen system and remote. The S61B soundbar is white and lays virtually flush on the bottom of the bottom of the monitor\u2019s stand. This is one major positive of getting your external speakers from Samsung versus other brands.If you hate the built-in sound of the monitor and your monitor's HDMI port connection is not being utilized, I would highly recommend pairing this monitor with the Samsung S61B Soundbar.The Monitor\u2019s Sound is now really fantastic especially for apps like YouTube for Music, Movies, Podcasts, etc.",

Es un monitor excelente en casi todos los aspectos, muy estetico, ademas que se transforma en una Smart TV, lo queria para conectarlo a una Macbook por usb-c y funciona de maravilla en 4k. Antes de comprarlo habia regresado 2 monitores mas costosos que este de otras marcas porque se veian fatales con las Mac. Ojala que en su sucesor Samsung aumente el refresh rate a 120Hz y mejore la calidad del sonido para que sea a\u00fan mejor. Al precio que se encuentra actualmente es la mejor opci\u00f3n del mercado :)",
