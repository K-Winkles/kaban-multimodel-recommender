The Amazon delivery guys were friendly and handled the box with care. I absolutely love this tv. I am amazed by how easy it was to get it personalized and how easily I was able to sign into Netflix, Prime, Hulu etc. The tv will give you step by step instructions. It doesn\u2019t look heavy but two people should be carrying/ lifting this tv for mounting to the wall or when putting it on a tv stand. I can\u2019t say enough great things about the quality of the picture resolution. It just seems impeccable to me. The colors are very vibrant, especially the blue tones. (See attached pictures ) I did not purchase a soundbar and in my personal opinion the sound from the tv is strong enough. This tv comes with a user friendly remote.I do not regret buying this tv. I highly recommend it.",

The tv arrived a day earlier than estimated and replaced an older Samsung Tv. The packaging was good and offered good protection. Tv setup was easy although different from previous TVs. The remote is ridiculous. Very modern looking and streamlined but a puzzle to use. There are no numbers on the remote. It looked more like an Apple Remote. Curious.Fortunately, the cable remotes worked and I put the Samsung remote in the drawer. Will only use it for setup changes like brightness, timers, etc.The picture quality is very good and the advertised features work well. Have had the tv in place for two months and very satisfied with the purchase. Price was fair.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a solid TV under $1500, and after looking into oleds and neo qleds I didn\u2019t want to spend more than $2500 for a 75\u201d TV. So I went with the Samsung 75\u201d Q80B. I had this TV for a week, looks great watching 4K movies on Disney+, Amazon Prime, Netflix. At times picture looks clear and solid, but when the action picks up, it can get a little pixelated, fuzzy, but hardly noticeable. During dark sense like watching Star Wars, the picture could be hard to see, even when watching at night, but overall it\u2019s not bad. I was using the apps to stream on the TV and also with Apple TV (2nd gen), seems the quality looked better on board TV apps. The overall TV experience was great, the TV was easy to set up, the screen is huge and bright and it sounds really good too, remote easy to use, I recommend 2 people to help hang it on a mount for install it\u2019s very heavy for one person. I would have kept the TV but I didn\u2019t like it when watching sports, the action was a bit too grainy and pixelated for me, I tried adjusting the settles and lowering contrast but I couldn\u2019t get it dialed in, enough for me to just send it back and buy the next Samsung up. I upgraded to the 75\u201d QN90B so far that TV doesn't have these small issues, but did have to spend the extra money to satisfy my needs. I think if you need an upgrade and your on a budget the Q80B will be a nice upgrade for you, but if you have the extra cash, go with QN models. 4stars for Q80B not great for watching sports.",

                "reviewText": "I had been looking for a new lg screen for a while. This one had my attention but was on the fence due the high price compared to other screens of the same size. Once samsung opened up the gaming hub to this TV I decided to jump on it as I was also going to buy an Xbox. That brought it to a more justified price. But beyond that the picture is amazing. Real blacks and whites. Colors are incredible as is brightness. I was also going to buy a sound bar but held off. Glad I did cause the sound is really quite good as is. Only thing I added was a skull candy crusher head set for games and movies without disturbing others. Those are great too and hooks up flawlessly. Negatives that I have experienced so far is sometimes the audio, picture are out of sink when streaming. And sometimes when playing games it gets stuck on the last controller imput so you can end up spinning in circles or something. We are a heavy gaming house and have the best internet available in the area and don't have those issues on other tvs whether streaming or gaming on a console, so not sure if it's a server issue or just too much bandwidth being used yet. Could also be the TV upscaleing the source to 4k if the content isn't 4k native. TV is hardwired straight off the router. The Remote is fantastically simple. Center stand is nicely heavy if you don't want to wall mount it and supports the tv well. But again the picture is just wow. Even watching previously watching movies is like watching it for the first time. So far no regrets.",
