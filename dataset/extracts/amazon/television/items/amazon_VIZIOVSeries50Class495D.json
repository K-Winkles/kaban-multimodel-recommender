                "reviewText": "I bought this TV and had difficulties getting it to work from the start. After resetting the TV I was able to get it on and running and even watched a couple of movies. When I unplugged the TV to move it, the issue I had originally experienced happened again. The screen would show the Vizio logo then proceed to a black screen never loading to home. After I reset the TV to factory setting the second time, I was able to get it woking and even enjoyed it for a couple hours before turning it off. When I went to watch it again at night I was able to get to a movie but when I tried to play it the screen would go completely green and not show any sort of picture. I do not have any issue with wifi and have since bought a new Samsung that works perfectly fine in my room. I don't know what is wrong with this TV but I do not believe amazon does a thorough enough job when reselling there used TV's. I would not suggest buying anything but brand new TV's from this website.",

                "reviewText": "I got my TV about a week ago. When I got it, it all seemed perfect and great. Just had to mess with picture settings a little for HDR games and such. Jump to a few hours later, I just got done with some gaming and decided to watch something with the TV speakers instead of headphones. The audio wouldn\u2019t play. It just kept making a small tick sound when it was supposed to play audio. Just one small tick and then nothing. Whenever I would power down the TV, it would make 5 ticks slowly and then stop and it would do the same when I turn it on. Still no audio. Tried resetting the TV and it did nothing. Randomly it started producing sound again after a while. Now it randomly does make sound and then randomly stops making sound and just does the small ticking. This makes it impossible to watch anything through the smart features because there is no sound. Luckily I have my Xbox and can just use headphones. But anybody who is hoping for just a smart TV to watch everything on should beware this.",
