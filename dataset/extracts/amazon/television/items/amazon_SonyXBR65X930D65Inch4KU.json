                "reviewText": "First off, this TV is a great value given the ~50% price drop from the launch MSRP. The shift in the television marketplace from 2016 to 2017 onward seems to be towards less features for more money. For example, this is one of the last native 3D ready TVs on the marketplace. If you're interested in 3D, even in passing, this TV is your last chance. From 2017 onward ALL television manufacturers decided to drop the 3D feature as well as native 120hz refresh rates at this price point. Don't be fooled, most TVs under $2,000 in the 2017 line of televisions have 60hz native refresh rates with image processing that they use to claim 120hz or higher effective refresh rates (some will claim as high as 900hz). You can still get higher native refresh rate TVs, but they start getting pricey for no apparent reason other than manufacturers trying maximize profit by locking away better image quality at higher price points than prior years.The XBR55X930D arrived impressively packaged and was fairly easy to remove from the packaging. You'll need two people to carry it as it is very thin and heavy. Be especially mindful of the top of the TV as it is as thin as a Starburst candy. The stand looks sophisticated, but I felt a clean wall mount makes the most of the aesthetics that Sony put into the design of the device. Mounted against the wall the TV looks posh but not out of place. It's not just a TV it's home decor, on or off.Powering on the TV for first use has you sprint through a gauntlet of questions and Google account login credentials. Folks who have purchased brand new Android phones are keenly familiar with this process. Prepare to devote 30 minutes navigating all the set up menus and waiting for your TV to update its Android TV OS software to the latest version. Get familiar with the accompanying TV remote because you'll need to master it in short order. Once updated, you'll be presented with the Android TV menu.Android TV is the operating system that manages all aspects of the XBR55X930D's functionality. It has a lot of useful features if you take the time to get the most out of it. For starters, get familiar with the accompanying TV remote. Learn to use the, microphone, input, navigation arrows, enter, back, and home buttons on the remote control. You'll be using them A LOT and you'll want to be able to locate them by touch. When I mentioned in the title that you will need patience to get the most out of the TV... playing around with Android TV will take some getting used to. I highly recommend you first go into the Picture Settings menu and turn off MotionFlow as it creates the dreaded \"Soap Opera\" effect. Which in my opinion hurts the image quality despite Sony marketing it as an improvement. Initially I had difficulty activating the 3D functionality over various content sources and syncing the 3D glasses (sold separately). I also had trouble finding the right media player to play content streamed off my home network (I found that Kodi is a decent media player but needs configuring). Again, you'll need to learn how to navigate all the functionality of the device and various quirks. One of the quirks that I've noticed on both the Android phones and now Android TV is that the devices function best if you restart them (as opposed to sleep mode) every few days to clean up memory leaks that might slow down the OS. Nothing huge, but just an FYI.Once you've gotten the TV set up the way you want and the content available for viewing then the fun really begins. The image quality is simply gorgeous. 4K (2160p) videos in particular look amazing. 1080p and 720p videos look great also despite the fact that the TV is made for 4K native output. Even 480i videos look no worse than they did on native SDTVs despite being blown up to a significantly larger size than their native resolutions. I initially experienced \"jitter\" with 4K video over my laptop that was advertised as supporting 4K, but resolved this by connecting a more powerful computer to the TV. 4K on the Youtube app plays flawlessly if you want a free app based source for 4k video content. The TV's sound output is what you would expect from a TV as thin as a piece of candy, nothing spectacular... but Sony showed effort. I purchased a $130 sound bar / subwoofer combo and connected it through the HDMI 4 ARC (audio return channel) port. This special HDMI port allows you to control connected devices (the volume of the sound bar for example) through the TV remote, effectively turning the TV remote into a universal remote control. I would recommend a sound bar to get the most out of your audio experience with this TV. I wouldn't spend more than $200 at the most for a sound bar as sound quality DOES NOT scale with price in that market.As of writing this review, I've owned my XBR55X930D for about 2 weeks. I think 5/5 stars is a fair score for this device. It's a thoroughly impressive TV...full stop...from industrial design and physical aesthetics to image quality and feature set, Sony went all out. It took more of a time investment to learn how to get the most out of TV than I was initially expecting. However, I've gotten over the learning curve and I am enjoying 4K video, 3D gaming and movies, seamlessly casting content from my phone directly to the TV, and music via Spotify with no problems. For those looking for more than just any TV to watch prime time TV shows on before bed, this TV delivers. It's the perfect TV to couple with a gaming rig, a NAS holding your media collection, or simply use the suite of Android TV apps for all your content sourcing. It took me a few months to finally pull the trigger on a new TV, but this has been one of the best electronics purchases I have ever made.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars End of a Sony Products Lifetime \u2013 This TV is a piece of Garbage, Same as Sony Customer Service",
                "reviewText": "At least for my eyes and the way I enjoy TV, there is nothing like a Sony: colors are vibrant and sharp yet natural enough so they don\u2019t feel forced into you and sending TV programming to the realm of the UHD imagination, were things look amazing but definitively not real. In most of the other non-OLED UHD TVs, image often looks like everything is wearing an extra cover of make-up, which can be good in certain cases (animation, visually extreme Sci-Fi) but it looks completely and hopelessly artificial most of the time. UHD programing looks absolutely impressive in this TV; in terms of image quality, this is the best TV you can get at this size, period. However, here is where this entire marvelous world ends, some of the flaws of this TV are too great and too obvious to ignore. Granted, image rendering and image quality should be the most important feature on a TV and that\u2019s why I give it 4 stars despite what I\u2019m going to describeThe first obvious flaw is the remote control. Seriously Sony? The control UI is just above garbage level, with tinny buttons that look and feel the same all over the remote and a very awkward wheel-type selector in the middle. Want to pause a program? Use the same type of tinny button you use to Play, Fwd, Back, mute, sound, input, etc., it is impossible to operate this remote without having to look at it carefully which quite honestly is very silly to say the least. Add to that the remote is not lighted and that its shape is a perfect rectangle (hard to know what\u2019s front and what\u2019s\u2019 back) and you cannot operate this remote in the dark which will be most of the time, at least for me. It also look and feels really cheap, not worthy of the status of this TV, I have seen much better remotes on TVs half its price. The remote range is also very narrow and it takes ages to react during the first minute the TV is turned on. The only thing that works pretty good I would say is the voice recognition but its use is limited to a few apps, and it cannot be used to control the TV settings or move around the TV UI (Really Sony?)Then, the poor UI designing ability of Sony moves into the TV. The Android TV interface looks awkward and counter-intuitive to operate, the learning curve is steep, having to go back and forth many times and spend an awful amount of time learning to use it. It is also very slow to respond. The way to manage apps is cumbersome, and its \u201cDiscover\u201d menu option seems like a very good idea but again its use is limited to a few apps and there are some parts of that section that cannot be changed or customized. So if you don\u2019t particularly like that section too bad, you have to live with it, you cannot even hide itFinally, I spent months trying to fix an issue with the Wi-Fi not working even if the status said connected, having to reconfigure the network several times, etc., very frustrating. Sony support was simply useless, I ended up stumbling into a solution on a messaging board and it was something that didn\u2019t work for everybody, I was lucky it worked for me. So take a notch down for Sony\u2019s technical support, or better said lack of itOh, one very positive thing is the sound, if you connect the TV to a Dolby Digital capable sound bar or receiver you will get pure Dolby Digital sound straight out of the TV which is something not all TVs support, on this respect Sony has been always very careful with the sound capabilities of its TVs, very smart as sound is a complement to the imageOverall and amazing, visually stunning TV with a sub-par UI and Remote Control. The remote can be fixed with a universal one but you will have to live with the deprived interface. But image will always look gorgeous, that\u2019s a factEDIT AFTER THREE YEARS:I have been using Sony products for all my life, but this TV marked the end of that relationship. After this horrible experience, this is my last Sony product ever, good riddanceThis TV was incredible, beautiful to watch, vibrant colors, incredible 4K resolution, etc., all what the marketing material says was true. What they forgot to say is that it will fail after three years, and that as Sony post-sale support is as bad as the quality of its products you will need to shop for a new TV. Compare this with the Sony TV this one replaced, one of the first flat screens, bought in 2007 and retired proudly in 2017 in perfect working condition, when all cable TV provider moved to only digital signal as it didn\u2019t have a digital signal decoder built in. That was the Sony of the past and the one that justified paying a premium for its products. That Sony is sadly goneIt all started one day that out of the blue, the TV decided to show a double image. The double image will stay there for a few minutes, then go away for a certain period of time, then come back, disappear again, etc. I did everything, from checking the 3D TV settings to a factory reset to no avail, suggesting this an issue with an internal component. I looked around the web and this was the general conclusion also. I then tried to reach Sony support and this was the experience: \u201cDue to the COVID-19 crisis our telephone support center is closed. If you have a product under warranty and need to support call this number or chat with us. If you have a product not under warranty please call your nearest Sony TV authorized repair shop\u201d So, don\u2019t bother us if your product is not under warranty, and it is not our problem that your two nearest Sony authorized repair shops are 200 miles away. Absolutely atrocious customer service, I feel the trust I put in Sony product completely betrayedSo now to look for a recycling option for 3 years old TV. Or give it to someone that pay more for the repair than what the TV is worth. After some research I reached to finalist for the replacement: Samsung and LG, I wanted LG badly but their 65 inches OLED TVs, the ones that are really worth it, are over $2,000 which is not justified (I decided to get a bigger TV) when in about 3 years more 8K will be the rage and will need to change the TV again. So Samsung QLed it is, very good price for a 65\u201d 2019 model with great reviews. Let\u2019s see",
