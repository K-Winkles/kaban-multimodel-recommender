NO DENTS OR DINGS WITH MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE POSTAL SERVICES INVOLVED. HAS A GREAT PICTURE AND WAS EASY TO SETUP TOO AND HAS ENOUGH PORTS TO CONNECT OTHER DEVICES TO IT.FOR HAVING SPENT SO LITTLE MONEY AND GETTING A NICE PRODUCT THIS WOULD BE A TV THAT I COULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.",

                "reviewText": "the bottom half of screen is either all line or foggy or both depending on what it decides to do also top right corner had a 2 inch black box that ran to center of screen and had varying number of vertical lines in it ......truly disappointing i have a hisense 40 inch NOT SMART tv that is over 10 years old maybe 15that still works which was why i went with hisense ........amazon did the right thing after UPS screwed up the pick up by not showing up and applied my refund to a different tv after several hours multiple times on the phone ..... would have been nice if amazone would have done the right thing on first phone call .... but better late than never ....... i fulfilled all my obligations for the return and it was not my fault UPS [whom amazon hired] failed to do their job [imo UPS and FEDEX drivers in my area are very poor at their job but amazon drivers do great job bringing product to door fedex never does and UPS does sometime fedex leaves next to road abd they disappear a lot] and after i explained this for the umpteenth time amazon did the right thing and credited refund to account so i could replace tv b4 sold out as it was over $100 off reg price and UPS missed friday pickup which made it at least a 4 day delay ...... i have decided not to buy from companies that use fedex many times due to the driver here not following fedex protocols and bringing package to door....i may have to pay a bit more on amazon occasionally but amazon drivers here do a great job delivering my stuff",

                "reviewText": "For those of you having trouble pairing the remote with the TV there is obviously a small little problem with the instructions given to you. Do not press the two keys that they show on the screen they are incorrect. They actually want you to press the center home key and the back arrow, those are the ones you should press as depicted in my picture. other than that no other problems with the picture quality internet and TV everything's functioning as it should. Good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Replaced an older 37 inch Vizio with fire TV. The fire TV tick was not responding to the remotes.The clarity is superior to the older Vizio. Setup was easy once I tossed the manual. It took awhile but after following the video setup on the screen it was a breeze. The only thing that disappointed me is the speakers. Might get a small sound bar to enhance the sound. Mounted it on our bedroom wall but had to run into town to get sorter bolts because the bolts from the mounting bolts for the heater Vizio were about a half inch to long.",
