                "reviewText": "Gorgeous tv, really looks like a painting!! Not too difficult to hang unless it's up higher like above a fireplace. Double check the instructions because it's easy to hang the brackets upside down. If done correctly the bracket behind the tv will not show at all. Default art is beautiful. Definitely pair with an additional frame purchase! Quality is excellent, use with gaming, streaming, audio is excellent as well. We paired ours with Polk Audio command bar & sub woofer and the sound is phenomenal.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this TV (55 in)in May 2022. Noticed a significant color change on the right side of the TV a couple months ago. We decided to call and were told service would come out for $140.00 non-refundable fee, but decided to move forward as we don\u2019t like filling landfills with TV\u2019s. The tech arrived and looked at the TV (ran the diagnostics that I\u2019d already run with Samsung tech help on the phone) told us that we needed a $900 screen and we should just buy a new one. Collected his $140 and left. I called Samsung and they agreed to provide us a new screen thankfully. I\u2019ve seen multiple videos on YouTube showing this is an issue. Seems the service company is just running around and collecting checks for a sub-par TV. I\u2019ve had many flat screen TVs for many years. All are still working and have gone through multiple house moves and are at our kids houses etc. Very disappointing that an expensive \u201cfancy\u201d frame TV would have such a short life. I definitely would not recommend this type of Samsung TV to anyone regardless of them being willing to repair in this situation. If you do, plan on needing service and get an extended warranty!",
