What's required for Lytmi Home App to fully function? 1.Please allow access requests to your phone's Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi for the app. 2.Ensure that you are using the 2.4 GHz network Wi-Fi(Currently 5G is not supported, we are working on it. Most routers nowadays have both 2.4G and 5G WiFi bands. Will the Lytmi Fantasy 3 Sync Box still work when I use the smart TV's built-in software to watch videos? Sync Box must be connected with a input signal to work normally.Please note that eARC is not supported.Directly connecting to the sync box may cause audio problems.Customers are advised to connect in a specific way:HDMI Input devices\u2192Neo3 box\u2192eARC\u2192TV Does the neo 3 sync box support VRR, ALLM and CEC? Currently Neo 3 sync box does not support VRR, ALLM and CEC functions, we are working on it, and the next version will be upgraded. (There may be some compatibility issues in the game mode of Samsung TV, please be careful Buy) Why does my TV backlight strips fail to switch off with my TV? The light strips turning off at the same time as the TV funtion is determined by whether your TV turns off the power to the HDMl port. If the HDMl port remains powered after turning off the TV,the light strips will also remain on.",

                "reviewText": "I finally upgraded my TV lights and decided to try this Lytmi Fantasy 3 because it works directly through HDMI instead of my old govee camera based system. Amazing! This is the bright, accurate color and instant response TV bias lighting I\u2019ve been waiting for all this time.I love a good immersive experience and had to put up with the shortcomings of the system I had before. It worked with a camera you mount to your TV and was incredibly distracting. With the Fantasy 3, it just works! Pretty cool that it has 4 HDMI inputs, so I can use it with my FIrestick 4k Max, Xbox, my PC, and room for one more.This totally blows away my old system that had an annoying delay because it had to pick up the image through the camera and process it. That would always take me out of the experience. This new Lytmi unit is literally instant, the background lighting is seamless with anything being played and can handle the fastest scenes and on-screen action. It legit looks like a pixel-perfect extension of the screen. We watched a few movies to test it out and actually jumped when lightning flashed or an unexpected explosion because it was in perfect sync with the video and audio and lit up the whole room.Another bonus of this upgrade is the color accuracy. With my old system, the camera had trouble picking the right colors depending on the scene and especially depending on the ambient lighting in the room. It didn\u2019t work well in the day even when we closed the blinds. With this unit, it\u2019s all done digitally directly from the HDMI video signal, so it works perfectly day or night. And the colors are always spot-on and match the video way better than I thought possible.Setup was easy and the Lytmi app is simple and easy to use. You can also do music-responsive lighting or ambient lighting effects and because it\u2019s so bright, it really creates a great atmosphere in the entire room. I tried it with all my video apps, Xbox, and PC and it worked perfectly. If you\u2019re a hardcore gamer and absolutely need variable refresh rate and automatic low latency, I just saw that they have a version for a few bucks more if you need those specific premium gaming features. Otherwise, it works great with our Xbox and we had fun playing with a more immersive experience.Overall a great system and a huge upgrade from my old lights. The Fantasy 3 has 3x times the number of LEDs, so it\u2019s super bright (and adjustable if needed for late-night movies). It\u2019s got 4x HDMI 2.1 inputs, so it can handle any UHD video. It\u2019s even got a feature that really seemed like any system should have had, it automatically turns On and Off with your TV! I know that sounds simple, but it\u2019s a great feature that makes it effortless and part of the whole system.Great system. Highly recommend you experience it yourself.",

                "reviewText": "This is a step up from the previous versions. The color saturation has been improved on HDR. which was its major drawback. It's not perfect but it's definitely improved. There are also more hdmi ports (previously I had to unplug the connections or run splitters) and it supports hdmi 2.1. Unfortunately no VRR support, though a new model is on the way that is said to. If that's a big deal for you, you may want to wait. I also have the Lytmi lightbars which sync with the screen as well. expanding the overall look. Hopefully these improvements keep coming.There is a lot going for this for the price compared to the competition, which is either extremely expensive (Philips) or less expensive but relies on a camera (Govee). That's why I gave it 5 stars. Not because it's perfect, but because it does most of what people want from ambient lightstrips, with a quick response time and denser lightstrips, but does it at a more affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "This product has 3 major flaws that unfortunately there is not much information out there on how to fix or cannot be fixed.1) there app looks like it was designed by a 5th grader. Not many options, not a lot of help or information, not user friendly2) the most important part the lights- they work sometimes. Well they always turn on but the way the transmit colors is weird. 2A) when moving fast in a video game it feels like they a strobe lights because they are trying to keep up with all the color changes (tired to change the settings to fix this with no luck) 2B) they aren\u2019t always accurate (eg. Greet transmits for a black screen)3) you can\u2019t bypass your tv or pc into the ACR HDMI and on top of that sometimes you won\u2019t get any signal at all from your device meaning you have to unplug this product and reset everything$150 is a ridiculous price for a piece of junk",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a dynamic backlight for my big screen tv for a few years now. They were either too expensive or too cumbersome to install. The Lytmi Fantasy 3 looked like it finally met my criteria. Pricey, but not unaffordable and looked like an easy install and setup. The install actually went much smoother than I imagined. And after connecting everything and loading the app, it was immediately working. The light responsiveness is fast. Do not notice any lag. The only things I wish were a little better: I would actually like it to be even brighter (I have it set to max brightness already), and the colors don't always match very well with what is on the screen. Otherwise it works great and I'm happy with the purchase.",

It even helps ease the eye strain in dark environments. Movies are much more interactive looking (seems like it extends the action of the tv outside frame of view). I did a lot of research of other brands and this is an all in one system. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to purchase more for each of my tvs. Well worth the money for the experience!!Install is extremely easy and done within and hour (I like to slowly make sure everything is perfect, you could do it under 30)Syncs perfectly to the app with lots of features you can adjust (brightness, sharpness of the less etc) which is perfect for different viewing (sports, movies, music etc.)",

                "reviewText": "Works almost flawlessly. Adjusts for letterboxing very quickly and looks great. Installation/setup was easy too. Watching tv doesn't look quite right with it off anymore.There are a couple of small issues though, color accuracy could be improved - it seems like the colors from the strip are more saturated than what's on screen. This can be distracting at times but it's not too bad for most scenes.The other issue is that I'll get flicker occasionally. It seems to be an issue with it trying to detect letterboxing. When a dark scene happens a flicker can happen based on the objects on screen that are highest/lowest in the frame. Obviously a software issue but it's not a frequent occurrence anyway so I don't see that being patched out.Otherwise though this seems to be a hell of a lot cheaper than hue and a lot cheaper. Would buy again for sure.",
