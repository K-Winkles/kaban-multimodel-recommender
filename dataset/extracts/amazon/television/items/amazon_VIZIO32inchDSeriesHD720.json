                "reviewText": "I had one of the previous versions of this TV, same size, still in great condition btw, but the Internet connectivity was always an issue, frequently freezing and dropping in the middle of streaming; although on the plus side, that one still gets updates. I was so frustrated with the performance of my last one, I wasn't going to get another of this brand, but decided to give this updated model a try. I just got it today. Like the other, setup was fast. Improved: it connected to the Internet immediately without connection errors. I also like the new remote design, where the whole back of the remote doesn't come off just for the batteries! I'm waiting for it to complete the updates and hopefully I will be set up and ready to watch my Netflix and play my video games.Update: After a few days of use, I have some feedback. This TV volume doesn't get very loud at all. It's in my bedroom, so it's not in a large space where the sound gets absorbed. Sometimes movies are hard to hear, seems like the actors whispered through the whole show, so I'm pressing the volume button, but it's still sounds too low, no matter how high it goes! My older Vizio has stronger volume than this one, and doesn't even go up to 100 like this new one! Even raised to 40, this doesn't do a lot. At 60-90+ you would expect to be blown away! However this just doesn't kick and needs a stereo system.",

She had me do the check on the TV. We spent about 30 to 45 minutes doing this.

It\u2019s so far in the back I couldn\u2019t reach it because I can\u2019t hardly walk , I told her I had to use a wheelchair or walker to get to the TV because I\u2019m non-amatory. You would think she would have some understanding about that. Oh no. She said in order for me to return the phone I\u2019ll get some service I had to go through the walk-through and try to see if I can get the TV to work. I called the bureau of business and I registered a complaint about Vizio and their poor service. I told her I still had the box to the TV that I would return it and its original box.

There are three bright spots in the upper middle part of the screen and my eyes seem to focus on them. No playing with the controls changes this problem. (2) the TV was assembled with a defect; the plastic border surrounding the image area was glued on at the op (slightly curved framework) without being fully pressed down. So the bright backup light shines through a narrow gap, maybe 1/16 inch wide in the top middle of the TV. I covered it with black electrical tape to hide the defect and stop the light from showing. Not very impressive, even for the modest cost. But it does work, so it is not a total loss.",
