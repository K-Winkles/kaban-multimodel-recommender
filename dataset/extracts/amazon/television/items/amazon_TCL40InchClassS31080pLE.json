                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a fan of the TCL Roku TVs. I have two 55\u201d series 6 sets that are going on 4 years old now that work great. This 32\u201d set is a lower tier than the series 6, but it is great nonetheless considering the price. Roku is superior to Fire Sticks in my opinion because their performance doesn\u2019t deteriorate over time and isn\u2019t as jam packed with ads like the Fire devices. As for the TV itself, it has gotten a lot of use in the first month or so- my kids play a lot of Switch and PS4 on it as well as watch movies. As with all my Roku devices, the UI is quick and responsive. The TV has solid picture quality and there is no noticeable latency while gaming as long as the built in \u201cGame Mode\u201d is on. If you\u2019re looking for a 32\u201d TV that balances quaility and price, this is a great option.",

                "reviewText": "The picture is crystal clear and vibrant. Set up is easy. It's the perfect size for the bedroom. Thank you to another reviewer who intructed us that we can turn off the standby LED light by going to settings>system>power>standby LED. The feet were a little bit of a pain for me to get on, but not enough for me to deduct a star. The price beats all others I was considering. You can rename the HDMI ports like I did when I connected my DVD player. I have not bought a sound bar yet as recommended on the manual, but it is nice to know which port to use for it and what is compatible. I connected my digital antenna to the cable/antenna port and local stations automatically come up first in the guide on Live TV, then many streaming channels are listed, although a little different than my Samsung smart TV in the living room.The mute and volume buttons are convenient on the side of the remote, but I will use none of the 4 preset app buttons on the bottom. It would be nice if you could program these. I did notice that I cannot submit feedback via the * button like I could on my stick about apps that fail to load. Some might miss the numbers on a regular remote to quickly go to a local channel, but you can favorite \u2661 channels. I see no power button on the TV itself. I did buy a riser that works well: LOTEYIKE Dual Monitor Stand for 2 Monitors, Large TV Riser.Parental controls are an option. Also, under privacy > advertising, you can personalize ads to see fewer ads about many topics that you can check off like mature content, violence, etc. You can put in your zipcode for local recommendations. There are power and sleep timer options.I did have to rearrange my Roku apps in my preferred grouping that I had installed on my previous Roku stick. For those not familiar with Roku: live TV with free streaming channels, videos apps, educational, movies, relaxing nature, music, health, self-help, and bible stuff (reading, teaching, prophecy, relaxing videos and true science). I don't need cable with all the cool stuff on Roku. This has the same wallpapers and themes as the stick. You can even set the screensaver to a fireplace, nature, something colorful, or a beautiful, live aquarium.Complaint: Roku live channels no longer have True History. So, for those of us wanting to learn about the Black Death, the plague of the Middle Ages or other fascinating history, we must install the Xumo app on Roku and go there to find it.",

                "reviewText": "The TV has a great picture hence the 1080p ...easy to setup and a great price. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the \"ridiculously\" large and very bright status light on the front and bottom of the unit. It literally lights up the bedroom at night. If you cover it the remote doesn't work. Why they need a light when the TV is off I don't know but this one is way too large and way too bright...almost returned the TV because of it. We have to get up an unplug it at night.If TV isn't in bedroom guess it's ok but a definite vampire electrical user!",

The app loading is easy and the picture is terrific for the money. The remote is very very basic just like the Amazon fire remote. I think this TV is a terrific value for the money!!!!!",

Absoulutely no issue with this at all, everything is crisp, brightm and vibrant.The remote i really cant say much about, it works, has few buttons (which is a good thing) but the only minor bugaboo is the media buttons on the bottom are all apps i do not use. It would be nice if Roku gave up blank buttons here and let us attach apps to them as we please.Sound quality isnt bad, but its not amazing though, dont expect to sound like a movie theater.Overall, its the best tv for the dollar i have bought in a long time. This tv is great for a bedroom unit.",
