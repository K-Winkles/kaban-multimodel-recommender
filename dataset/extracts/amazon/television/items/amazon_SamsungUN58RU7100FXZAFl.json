                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I might be lucky - very few problems with what I think is outstanding value.",
                "reviewText": "I read with great interest most of the negative reviews on Amazon and I have to admit I have very few of reported screams of pain - so I will go through my experience with the major complaints, one-by-one:1. Annoying setup - yes, having to go to computer to remember or reset passwords you have not used in forever slows you down, but you get through it.2. Bloatware, yes, but you just ignore it - what's the beef. There is bloatware on everything including every cell phone - so what? Ignore it. Most of it can be \"removed\" from the \"Smart Hub\" screen/menu area. The things that cant be removed I ignored. I will tell you when you register the TV - DO NOT CHECK box that says give me ad's, and make sure you DO NOT check the agree with all and continue - leave Ad unchecked and click continue not the Agree with all. Saves a lot of \"stuff\" from coming to TV.3. Complaints about loosing connection to network -- Not for me, wireless Netgear NIghthawk R7000 Router with 5ghz wifi in next room. Rock solid even before being notified there was a firmware update which I did. Was still rock solid after the update. As a retired computer teacher, I am going to guess that many have router signal strength issues - I have old home built in 70's without insulation in any interior walls and nothing metal in between the router and the guest bedroom where this TV is. For those that have problems, might get a WIFI extender for your Router (same brand as your router), put it in the room with the TV and see if there is any improvement. If not return it where you bought it and tell them - no improvement.3. Loosing connection every day - not for me - either my gamming quality router might be doing a better job than others, or the Samsung firmware update fixed it. I am going to guess that others have routers that are not reliably giving a consistent IP address (called DHCP) to the TV which I had occur one time - until I logged into my router and put the prior IP address into the RESERVED section. I think the best action is to not allow the router to hand out IP address to the TV but to fix a specific IP address for the TV. Playing Russian roulette with IP addresses is not good for consistent network connectivity. If what I just said is geek/greek, call your Router Manufacturer or your internet provider or possibly Samsung to ask for help in setting up a \"fixed address\" or \"reserved address\" for your TV. OR get a computer guy/gal friend to help.4. Complaints on TVplus channels being slow - yes, but for me with only a 30mbit download connection --- no slower than surfing the web on one of my PC's and going to a highly graphic web page like the Disney web site. Not a whole lot there that I would be watching anyway. Already removed about 2/3rds of the 60 stations that I would never watch.5. Movement/Lag complaints - didn't see that, did Netflix, Amazon Plus, even a 4K video from Prime - all with fast action and there was no problems; however, I am not a gamer - have NO feeling for what video will do on games. I would guess if you are a hard core gamer - you are probably better off with a QLED model (which I have and love - couple of steps above this TV and of course about $1500 more).6. No Bluetooth keyboard - no problem for me - plugged in a Logitech K400 receiver in the USB port (NOT THE ONE MARKED FOR HDD/SDD) and my keyboard with built in flat mouse pad worked great. No complaints.7. I don't get complaints on sound quality - I have moderate to severe hearing loss and even without my hearing aids, with the sound set to \"OPTIMIZE\" in the 12 ft x 10 ft guest bedroom with tile floors, and very little on walls - the sound was great and very clear. I would guess that in a large family room with plush carpet and lots of plush furniture - might not be able to power a room that large - carpet and furnishing would absorb a lot of the sound.8. Complaints about no old style RCA jacks - no, I think there is - but kind of hidden. There are 5 RCA style jacks marked -- 3 are video component R/B/G with one at the end half yellow/half green - which I think is the video you would use for VHS tape player with the two on the left (audio R/L - Red/White) - being used for sound. It appears like you can plug into it one way for component input and one way for old style RCA BUT not both - one or the other. Don't have a VHS player to test but it appears like it would work. Maybe another reviewer can test this and comment here or submit a review.9. Poor picture quality - for me only standard over the air - old TV channels - lacked \"quality\" but everything HD was outstanding. Not as good as QLED 55\", but for $1500 less I am thrilled about the quality.10. No Bluetooth for sound bar/headphones. Yes, but you don't want it - put Bluetooth on high end Samsung Qled and the talking heads for news or any voices were way off from the sound not matter how you adjusted it. Better to connect to the Optical Audio out with will avoid the performance issues. Yes, that will cost a little more than poorer quality sound Bluetooth stuff.11. Horrible manual (and web site not much better) - absolutely correct - no detail diagrams and examples of how to hook up various things from Old VHS to Optical Sound devices to keyboard, etc. I was tempted to take of a star for this but decided the lack of a good manual and instructions didn't affect the performance of my set. A list of \"compatible\" devices or more detail on them would have been great. You listening SAMSUNG?Bottom line for me - great value, great picture, great sound, and great addition to guest bedroom. This is the 4th or 5th Samsung TV for our family, extended family over the last 20 years- this is very good for our needs.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Would have been a flagship model in 2016.",
                "reviewText": "This TV would have been 2k dollars 3 years ago and considered a flagship model. Now that \"Quantum dot\" and other technologies are taking over, this is considered the base model. But man oh man, is it a good deal if you are upgrading a TV from 5-10 years back. Especially if you're old set was only 1080p (or FHD).The color accuracy of this set is great, it has deep blacks, and is brightly lit. In my living room that has a large sliding glass window I do notice some glare with the blinds open all the way and sun coming in, but I can still see the picture just fine and enjoy it. When you have proper dark viewing conditions, this set shines beautifully. Playing 4k content from Netflix was a genuine joy. Watching a sloth swim across a river, I put my nose almost to the set to see if I could spot the pixel matrix. The detail is so fine that it simply looked like the sloths hairs were on the surface of my set. I could not be happier with the picture.The SMART features of this set are also excellent. If you are part of the Samsung ecosystem, it can sync with your phone which will automatically set it up with your Samsung account and wifi password and apps. The process was very simple for me, but again I have a Samsung S8 that did all the work for me. Once synced, you can set the TV up on smart things and use your phone as a universal remote, mouse pad, and keyboard. It makes browsing on the tv very easy and enjoyable. Being able to tap out on my phone search terms in netflix or enter user names and password instead of having to thumb through using the TV remote was invaluable. For those that like to use headphones to watch tv, you can play your tv sound through your phone into your headset. This feature is great as the speakers on the TV are LOUD and will definitely wake the neighbors/family if you choose to watch in the late night/early morning. My only regret is that the OS is Samsungs proprietary system and not a version of Android that you could potentially modify with useful apps (such as Kodi) that may not be included. You can of course just get a fire stick and do so that way, but I would always prefer to just have a one stop shop if I can. Not a big deal but just note you are stuck with the Apps Samsung gives you access to.The tv has a nice \"game mode\" that detects when your console is playing and automatically adjusts to an ultra low latency mode that makes gameplay buttery smooth and colors pop on screen. Moving to this TV from my old Sceptre 50\" I was astonished at all the detailed textures and vibrancy of color I had been missing. It was almost like playing the game for the first time again.There are many nice and well thought out features in this \"base model\" TV that make it well worth the price if you are upgrading from a set that is 3-10 years old. While it may not have the incredible colors and HDR range that the latest technologies of QLED's offer, it is a GREAT set for the money you are paying and the size you are getting. Having the best that 2016 could offer is good enough for me, and if you don't need the absolute best and latest then I think you will find this set offers excellent value in both picture quality and SMART features.",
