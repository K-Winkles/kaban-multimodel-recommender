                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this at a local Walmart to replace a 32\" VIZIO that recently let the smoke out after several years. VIZIO ran 24/7 displaying security camera feeds via an HDMI cable from the DVR recorder. This would be similarly to hooking up a Dish Network, Direct TV or DVD player to the TV.I thought it was a great deal at less than $150 for 10\" more. However, I soon found out that you simply CAN NOT run this TV without already having a Roku account or creating one. I have no need for Roku. I just needed it to display whatever I hooked up to the HDMI port. It won't even let you select an input until you complete a sign in. Opening an account requires your email first, followed by opening a link in email, then providing your first/last name, date of birth, gender and something else I can't remember. If you don't provide ALL the info, it WILL NOT progress. Why must you provide DOB or gender to use a TV? I'm sure after this it would have required more unnecessary info but I couldn't get past this point.Called tech support who said I should not have hooked it up to internet and walked me through doing a factory reset. After doing this, it required me to connect to the internet for software update again or use a USB drive to download update on computer and then connect the USB to TV to update. Tech asked if I had an option to skip. Nope. No skipping allowed. So, I was told to connect to Wi-Fi again. After that, I'm back to being required to create an account. Was asked to do factory reset again. After reset, it asked to update software again. Tech said it shouldn't need to update again after just doing this. Well, it's asking again.After 30 minutes on the phone, tech said, \"Can't you just create an account and not use it?\" I don't want to create yet another useless account. Especially for something that should NOT require one.By this time, I had enough. I told the tech that I was NOT going to create an account and if this is required to use a simple TV, I was returning it and I thanked her for her time and patience.I then boxed it back up, took it back to the store, got my money back and then grabbed a 43\" VIZIO. Sadly, the VIZIO cost $40 more, but it didn't require me to open an account just to use it. I then found out from a co-worker, that ANY device that has Roku on it requires an account. So, beware. Stay away from anything with Roku's name on it unless you want an account with them. This ridiculous requirement just cost Onn this sale.",
