                "reviewText": "Vizio comes with the ability to add APPs to it from their store. Vizio has a huge selection of pre-installed APPs and a great Free selection. I find I watch Vizio now more than I watch the cable companies selection. I think I'm going to drop most or all of my cable.It was really easy to set up. It already had all the APPs I use already installed. I only needed to log in to access them. Be sure to have all your log in information to speed things up. You'll also need to know your WiFi information too. I accessed 6 APPs and my cable subscription, and to set all my preferences in less than 30 minutes.I've owned Vizio TV's for over 10 years and never had a problem till the one before this. All I had to do was contact Vizio customer support and give them the information about the problems I was having and they issued a refund. I had that set for over 2 yrs and they gave me almost enough to buy the new set which is a big rise in picture quality. The colors are vibrant and you have the ability to choose the calibration of brightness. This TV is for my bedroom and they even have a choice of brightness for dark rooms such as a bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "I've just spent a few days getting my Vizio \"Fire TV\" to work with all my devices. The VQP65C-84 has a great picture and decent sound but there is nothing about it that suggests Fire TV. If you want to use a Fire TV Recast, be prepared to connect devices such as Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Cube. The TV itself can not be directly connected to an Amazon account as those devices are and Fire TV Recast will not work without them.I called Vizio customer service for help but was told to set up my devices the way I did with my previous non-Fire TV smart TV. Therefore, I'm not sure why they call it Fire TV or even IF they should. Maybe it is because they have a lot of streaming apps preloaded onto the TV. But, according to Wikipedia, that's not what Fire TV is.So now, I have two home pages, one for Vizio and one for Amazon. Otherwise, it is, so far, a very good \"smart TV.\"Oh by the way, I had to turn down the brightness and color adjustments slightly. The picture was too bright and the color was over saturated. But those are just adjustments in settings. Looks great on Vizio and Amazon.",

What a fantastic picture! And on my Ps5. too! Just make sure you have it on game mode when playing. And, I literally sit amazed looking at the picture I see watching network tv, too. BEAUTIFUL! I still haven't even watched 4k video yet. And the price was very reasonable! No regrets! Gotta go! Time for MW3!",
