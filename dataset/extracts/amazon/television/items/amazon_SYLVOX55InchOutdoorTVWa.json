Wall mount bracket is not included. It is recommended to choose SYLVOX TV bracket. 2. Sylvox TV is designed to have a long service life. In order to ensure the stability and smoothness of the TV system, in addition to the APP that comes with the TV, it is not supported to download other APPs. 3. Sylvox outdoor TVs are brighter and the screen temperature will be higher when the TV is working, so the TV is not allowed to have a flush mounting method. Allow at least 4 inches of space around the perimeter of the TV and on the back of the TV to allow the TV to dissipate sufficient heat to prevent damage to the TV components due to high temperatures.",

                "reviewText": "I received my TV on June 19th - delivery time was average but it is a large heavy TV. When I installed it I was impressed with the picture quality - I hooked up an Amazon 4K firestick and it works great. I had no problem setting up my Wi-Fi network. The TV remote seems heavy duty and weather proof. The wall I mounted to on my uncovered patio is always in partial shade - so I turned down the brightness and the picture looks great. Due to the fact the speakers are protected and the sound comes from the bottom of the TV - I recommend getting a sound bar but if you don't have one right away the sound seems fine. I did use their customer service for a minor replacement part - they were fast to ship it out to me and it did not affect me hanging my TV to the wall mounts.All in all - very good TV for the money - I recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't familiar with Sylvox but it's a name I won't forget now. After doing some research in outdoor TVs. The size, NITs, and QLED factors all led to me purchasing this unit. I can't be more pleased with the picture quality. As with most TVs the sound is best when paired with a sound bar. I give it four stars across the board. The overall score is 5 stars, and that's because of the customer service. In a word, stellar. Firstly, my puppy got to the remote so that was a wrap. I called and let them know exactly what happened, and they still replaced my remote, free of cost. Secondly, and most importantly, my unit sustained some water damage and was no longer operational. Suffice it to say... please still purchase a TV cover even though the unit is waterproof. Again, Kiko, Leeke, and the Sylvox customer team ensured I received a replacement unit at no cost. Can't speak high enough about my experience. Well recommend this company and product.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, we take it camping!! It fits our \"roughing-it\" lifestyle. The TV sat right there in the rain while we watched divisional playoffs outdoors. It worked GREAT. That big speaker below it helps the sound. As you might assume, a TV that's wrapped in metal, might not have the best sound quality. Thankfully, there's a headphone jack inside the weatherproof compartment, and it plugged right into my weatherproof speaker. If there were any improvements that I could want, they would be a place to attach a padlock/cable lock. While I had a lock on it, wrapped around the tree, it's only going through the mounting bracket, which can be removed with screws. Sylvox, help me make this more secure! The other thing I think it should have is an easy to remove weatherproof cover over all the ports. This thing has about a dozen tiny philips screws. Such a pain for how we use the TV. If we simply mounted this outdoors at home, then I wouldn't need frequent access. But as a mobile camping TV? I want in there. I paired this with a Roku, since the \"smart\" in this TV isn't all that smart. No apps like YouTube TV. Just the basics, like Netflix.",

Almost unnoticeable but definitely there. I will update after we deal with customer service but the problem is it was a ton of work and paid a guy to help me wall mount. Going to see if these dots disappear at all or may have to return. Super bummer.",
