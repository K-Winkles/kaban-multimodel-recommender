The TV looks great in our medium sized room. It is a good size to have friends over to watch sporting events or for movie watching on the big screen without the movie theatre.",

                "reviewText": "This TV is a downgrade from my 43\u201d Sceptre. UI is slow, remote app never brings up the keyboard, I\u2019m still using a plug-in Roku for half of my apps, sound sucks, picture doesn\u2019t look any better than my 43\u201d 720p Sceptre from 2016. Wish I kept the box. Also, the sound is half a second behind the picture! Regardless of source/channel/sound output. If anyone buys this I\u2019ll give you $100 for the box so I can send mine back!Update: it\u2019s been a month and this product continues to disappoint. It is a daily reminder of what a terrible purchase I made. This TV is terrible, disfunctional, unreliable and just low quality cheap cheap cheap. I will likely throw it in the trash as soon as I can afford to replace it.Update #2: it\u2019s May. This product continues to inspire doubt and drive self depreciation every night when I stare miserably at the lackluster and disappointing screen of low resolution and overall garbage picture quality. However, I must say that the most astounding feature of all is the remarkably non-user-friendly interface, you are required to interact with in order to change the channel or look at the guide or change the source. It is unbelievably painful to cycle through sources. The user interface is remarkably unable to interact with common place applications like Spotify or YouTube and, time and time again I am forced to transfer from the Soundsystem in my house, that I paid so much to enjoy, to my handheld cell phone so that I can actually watch anything for more than five seconds without the entire system crapping out due to this products Inability to deliver on any single one of its promises.",

The assemble took nere minutes. The TVis smart enough to switch over to the gaming port as soon as I turn on my PlayStation. Once switched off, it swutches back to previous thing you were watching (free samsung plus TV, for example) I will stick to this brand for now on. Oh and the picture quality is top notch.",

I fiddled with it and went thru a series of trial and error and finally got the darn thing to retrieve what I asked of it!! But all in all, I think the set is really good. It's not a particular bargain price, but good overall There is so much to choose from with regard to channel selections, you would have to stay awake 24/7 to watch them all. But there is something for everyone's taste in movies and programs.",
