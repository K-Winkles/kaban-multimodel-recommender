                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace a 50\" vizio smart tv that picture was failing on. Love the fire tv and the included alexa. Color is great and setup was a breeze. Some said the build felt cheap to them - guess I DON'T know the difference in cheap plastic and good plastic - besides I really don't sit around feeling the build quality.Price was really good and features are good. The remote is user friendly as is the os. I REALLY DO RECOMEND THIS TV.Had a small problem with the sound on one channel which was odd as all other channels were fine. Called their help line and customer service walked me thru a very easy fix. Still a 5 star and will include customer service in the rating.HAVE had this TCL TV for one month and I find it better than our 65\" SONY, better picture, color, sharpness just better all the way around. The one thing it lacks is a lot of color adjustments, but out of the box it really didn't need any and if I could adjust the settings I would probably screw it up. Just buy it! UPDATE: 3 months and still very satisfied with the purchase. I did notice that one person had trouble with the optical port in hooking up his sound bar. The best way to hook up the sound bar is to use the HDMI e arc port and it works great. I have never tried the on board speakers as I am extremely satisfied with the sound bar. Will update in six months. UPDATE; Small problem due to internet going down for close to a day. When it came back on I had all smart functions. but all cable channels were gone and it was easy getting them back, but they would not open. I called TCL help line and they worked me thru the problem, but did have to reset the tv by unplugging it-waiting for a bit then plugging it in again. All was well then and I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THE PICTURE SEEMS TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. Help line was very good and sayed with this 91 year old until all was fixed'",

                "reviewText": "This is a secondary unit placed in a home office and it\u2019s used almost every day. The picture is quite sharp, excellent quality, bright colors and very good contrast, right out of the box, no additional adjustments were done. The sound, on the other hand, because of the smaller speakers, is a bit of the weaker side, requiring a higher adjustment, but once that is done, it sounds good and intelligible. The setup was quite easy, in just a few minutes being able to connect to the internet and getting access to all my favorite apps. The remote strongly resembles the one used by the Amazon stick and the TV is Alexa friendly. I haven\u2019t tested that feature yet because I prefer to look for my own favorite apps and movies. The unit is quite light, easy to move around and the supporting plastic stands were very easy to install. Overall I am very happy with this TV and I would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived before expected packaged well. No damage. Was hard to find the holes for wall mount...finally saw them amost on the bottom. So beware. Got it wall mounted and the mount shows on the bottom as the holes are so close to the bottom on the rear. Usually the wall mount holes are in the middle. So if you're going to mount on an existing one, beware. The set up was very easy. Turned on and it was already set up for our Amazon account. That was nice. Download and installation of apps was easy. Within an hour all was complete and was operating just like our old one. The picture quality is good....but we're not fussy. Some would say it could be better but at this price point I can say it was as good a picture as the one we replaced that was much pricier and died after only 4 years. The sound is better than our old one as well. I like that the remote is the same as the one we had for our fire stick, which we no longer need. Overall, I've very happy with this TV and the entire transaction.",

Picture quality is good for the price of the TV. I'm a gamer and the quality of the picture for my games is amazing. Connected my Bluetooth sound bar effortlessly. I've had no issues laoding and updating my fire TV. Overall im pleased with the TV I purchased. Only thing I will say is it's not OLED which was my last tv before I upgraded to the 75 inch TCL but I can deal with not having OLED. I like the fact that I can adjust the color and picture settings. Internal speakers could be better. My soundbar makes my tv sound like a theater.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced a 39\" 1080p LED tv with this 43\" 4k Fire TV. I like this TV very much. I stream shows from multiple apps on my Roku, but now I don't need the Roku because this TV has all the same apps I was using. I mainly game on this TV on an Xbox series X. There are many settings available and there is an auto gaming mode that is enabled while gaming(a little icon pops up saying it's going into gaming mode). Many settings are the same type you'd find on any brand of TV, but this has some settings that were new to me. You can set the TV speakers to automatically apply a Dolby Atmos effect which surprisingly sounds decent on the small TV speakers. Dolby Vision HDR looks great on games that support it which there are many. For the price I paid for this TV I am surprised how good this TV is and how much I like it. The TV speakers really are good enough to use on their own(No bass, good vocal audio, decent all around), I did connect the TV via Bluetooth to my stereo amplifier which is connected to Kef speakers and a subwoofer, Bluetooth sounds excellent on this TV. If you get this TV and plan to game on it with an Xbox Series X, don't forget to adjust some of the settings on the XBOX to make sure 4k is enabled, Dolby Vision is enabled and the correct Stereo, Dolby Digital or Dolby Atmos is enabled for your sound system. On my stereo speaker only setup, Dolby Digital sounds best while gaming on XBOX.",
