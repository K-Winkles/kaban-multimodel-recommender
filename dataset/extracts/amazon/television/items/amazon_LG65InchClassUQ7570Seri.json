                "reviewText": "Love the picture quality, It's first rate. An Ultra 4K is good enough for me, I don't need or want the newer kind because my 9 yr old Samsung was not a Smart one and was only 720p, and it still works great. It's going in the bedroom. Bright, contrast, and the depth of the picture quality is fantastic. The remote is a typical remote you would get with your TV from long ago. I don't plan to use any of the Smart app features built in, I will buy a separate Roku or Fire Stick instead because these built in ones aren't any good. I plugged in my soundbar using the Optical In but it works using Bluetooth too. I have it hooked up to the net but I'm not using it. I don't game because I'm too old for that. Intallation is easy. Just screw in the legs lift onto your TV stand (weighs 32 LBS) Great price, great TV, great brand in LG. LG or Samsung are the only two to buy.",

                "reviewText": "It came a day early! The box was falling apart a bit at the bottom but otherwise great condition, no damage to the tv.I got the 65\u201d and it\u2019s a bit heavy but manageable to lift from the middle by myself.The legs were easy to put in (2 screws and 2 little peg pieces each). They seemed unstable prior to installation but they work great!Remote initially scared me bc a lot of the reviews were complaints about it not matching, not working, or some other issue. FALSO ALARM THO\u2014I put one of the batteries in backward lmao. Worked like a charm after I realized haha.Setup was super easy. You can do manual or through a QR code in your phone.Picture quality is really really good. I usually run my tv on \u201cvivid\u201d and this HDR color really puts in some work!Speed is fast. I don\u2019t play games on it but it doesn\u2019t seem to have any lag with the applications and streaming services I use via my Apple TV.All in all I love it!!!",

                "reviewText": "It is a decent TV for the price. The setup was easy, but the legs being close to the sides require a big tv stand, at least 50 inch in length to barely fit. As far as picture quality it is good but I agree with the reviewers that remote is not good, it is very unresponsive when you are navigating internet media content or smart features. I will most likely buy a 4k Roku stick. Some apps are not in the smart tv such as spectrum tv. The sound is okay for a typical smart tv, but I opted to buy an LG sound bar to enhance its sound quality. And the tv looks good esthetically, I think 400+ dollars is a bargain.",

But it was VERY frustrating. BESIDES that, the TV works great, sound and picture is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I picked the lg tv because of webOS. Historically I've used PS4's as media servers but they're showing their age and my kids are all grown now, so it was time to upgrade. I first tried The Roku 4k system but it has a longstanding oversaturation problem with hevc codec that apparently they don't intend to solve. I have an extensive DVD and Blu-ray library I've cut to my own media server, and want to reconvert my old discs and add more 4k content before discarding thephysical media to more space efficient codecs, and since Roku isn't an option, my research led me to the lg platform and webOS.I am not disappointed. It arrived earlier today and was easy to mount and set up. It is extremely feature rich. The responsiveness of the ui isn't great, but that's my only complaint. I've started watching some of my media and have been shocked how much better it looks here than my old 4k tv. Sound is pretty good, but whatever software upscaling this TV does is almost *too* good, everything looks at least one resolution level better than it is! 480p looks like 720, 720 looks like 1080, and 1080 looks like 4k! I can't use this to check the quality of my encodes anymore or everything will look like crap on all other platforms!The upscaling occasionally causes some weird artifacting but it's hardly noticable to anyone in the family but me.I can highly recommend this platform.",

This LG tv wishes to lead one of these Geeks down a path of scanning and inputting just about everything down to my sock size!....just to access the functions the tv has in order to use....SO, ok lets go fast, pilgrims, and in doing so have noticed that once accomplished (becoming hooked into the labyrinth ofsmart tv world) we do enjoy the LG...Exception is the operating system that is just tedious...say, compared to the Roku versions made by other manufacturers.Remote has a lot of buttons that are so close together one needs a stylus or finely honed fingernails to press.Love it and and will trade it in on another...or give the dang thing away..Happy viewing....jcmb",
