                "reviewText": "Finally got this installed. The picture quality is really very good, but the art mode is fantastic. I haven\u2019t figured it all out yet but so much better than a black screen when there the TV is off. At night you can actually turn it off or program it to a set time off. The remote is solar or can be chanrged which is better than going through batteries.The first tv was damaged in shipping but the seller reordered and delivered with a white glove service and it arrived in very good condition. The only downfall is the wire that goes from the tv to a connection box. I hope Samsung solves this in the future. Our TV was installed over a fireplace which was flat to the wall, so would have required a lengthly install to go through the studs and then down to a cabinet. with the connecting wire. Our solution was our FP mantel had a post on each side that was hollow, and the installer drilled down through it and out at the floor. The wire only needed to be hidden on the mantel itself.",

                "reviewText": "Product worked fine until we plugged in a Google Chrome device and it went dead. Tech service took four hours texting to determine it was dead. Samsug service issued a repair order and then canceled the repair order two weeks later without notifying me. When we called they ordered a replacement unit but then four days later they called to say they could not send a replacement unit since they have no warranty stock. Now they want to take the TV away and issue a credit two days after they pick up the TV! Spent a bunch, have a dead TV and now waiting on a trucker to pick up the dead TV and hopefully get a replacement. Sucks big time.",

                "reviewText": "I don't think the picture is as sharp as on my 5-year-old Samsung it is replacing but it's not bad and the antiglare is a big help. I think possibly this is because of the matte finish on screen making it seem less sharp. However, I have a large western window that my TV faces and it was nearly impossible to watch TV in the afternoon and early evening. The anti-glare screen completely eliminated the problem. The biggest con is the fancy new remote control. It takes multiple steps to get to what you want and just doesn't do some things at all. I will see if my old universal remote can be made to work on it.",
