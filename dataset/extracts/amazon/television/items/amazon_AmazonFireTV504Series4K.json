                "reviewText": "I considered getting a larger TV for several years before finally ordering one last week. I got a good price, and it was delivered in 4 days, just as advised when I ordered. The Amazon delivery driver carried the package upstairs without being asked, and was pleasant and helpful.The TV itself is quite light, and I was easily able to unbox it myself (but anything larger than the 44\u201d would need 2 people). The legs attached easily, and the cord and HDMI cables were obvious and easy to hook up. I had the unit in place and connected in just over 5 minutes.Since I\u2019m not very tech-y, setup of new electronics is always a worry. I turned on the TV with the remote, selected my wifi network and entered the password. The TV then cycled several times through \u201cdownloading software\u201d and \u201cinstalling updates\u201d screens. I was worried that I was stuck in some tech vortex, but just waited. After about 10-15 minutes, the TV prompted me to sign in with my Amazon account, asked whether I wanted extra channels or parental controls, then boom, it was on its regular Home Screen and I was good to go!Picture is clear and colors very saturated compared to what I previously had. Sound is good (general purpose, I\u2019m not a music critic) and refresh rate very adequate for TV (I\u2019m also not a gamer). I think that for my purposes (occasional TV viewing, probably less than 8 hours per week), this will be an excellent set that I will enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "50\" firetv is lightweight, and has a nice picture. assembly is straight forward, but it comes with the wide stance legs. This did not fit on my TV stand so I installed a different aftermarket center style base via the wall mount screws. the smart interface will be loaded with amazon's ads, which is cumbersome and a bit of an eyesore, but otherwise works well enough once you learn where everything is located. the alexa integration works like expected. my polk soundbar works properly through the provided HDMI-ARC/eARC port. in the software version as of the review date, note that without an internet connection the OTA antenna channel list will not automatically refresh the available programming without first going to the individual channels which seems to force a refresh for that channel. the remote is small and lightweight with only a few buttons, and relys heavily on either navigating the menus or using alexa. the lower 4 buttons are shortcuts to popular streaming services and are just an annoyance when accidentally pushed- all of that is available from the menus or alexa like everything else so they are unnecessary. if you want your TV to turn on to wherever you were when it was last turned off you will need to enable that in the settings as default behavior is to always bring you to the main menu screen to see the ads.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great smart TV for the price",
                "reviewText": "The 55\" smart TV for a little over $300 (was on sale at the time) was delivered almost immediately. Was easy to assemble the \"feet\" and was already configured to connect to my network. It integrated my Recast almost instantly, without being prompted and was also easy to connect to an Echo Studio for \"surround sound\". Well, not quite with just one of them, even with ATMOS content, but it beats the built-in speakers.Speaking of the Echo Studio, you lose the on-screen volume indicator and apparently can't hold the volume buttons down, as you can when using the TV speakers. The former is irritating and the latter is just plain silly for such an expensive add-on.UPDATE:Added a second Studio and subwoofer and they were also easy to connect to the TV. Now it does surround sound about as good as an average sound bar, though will pale in comparison to high-end sound bars. Still, these have the potential for a lot more separation, as you can put the two speakers anywhere in the room.This makes for an amazing home theater experience in virtually any room. They appear to connect over ad hoc WiFi networks and the reliability is good, though it will occasionally drop the left or right channel (or both).Generally, it either snaps out of it in a minute or two or pausing and then playing or switching inputs or asking one of the speakers a question or whatever seems to make it reconnect. It's mildly annoying, but have never had to stoop to unplugging anything to get around it. Can always switch back to the TV speakers in the Home Theater settings in a pinch, but that hasn't been necessary here, at least not yet.And, as expected, the speakers play music on demand. Unexpectedly, the cover art, lyrics, playback controls, etc. are displayed on the TV. That's a nice feature.It also integrated with my Ring cameras effortlessly, showing them in the PiP when people are detected. I think that's the the threshold anyway (i.e. not just for motion). May be a Ring setting that controls this, but happy with the way it is working; though beware, Ring cameras sometimes fail to identify people.And speaking of the remote. The redesigned button layout is really stupid. The old layout was much easier to find the right buttons with your thumb. The new one is all uniform rows and columns of same-sized buttons. Maybe they thought that looked \"cleaner\", but the ergonomics have taken a huge step backwards. Also wish they'd lose the dedicated buttons for Disney+, Hulu, etc. It's advertising and only convenient for those who subscribe to the sponsors' services.Still, couldn't be happier at this price point. Picture looks great to me, though surely pales when compared to sets that cost twice as much. And, as expected, built-in speakers are not great, but soundbar support is rumored to be very good with this model (unlike some previous Amazon-branded TVs that I've owned).Hopefully it will last. I still use the other two I bought three years ago. And hopefully they'll fix the stupid Alexa bug that prevents turning it on and off by name. (!) Yes, \"Turn on Den TV\" responds with \"Den TV doesn't support that\". (!!) Oddly enough, this \"trick\" works fine with the older models, though one of them will go into a \"coma\" once it is off more than a few minutes, foiling all attempts at automation until the remote is used to turn it back on (defeating the whole purpose). That happened about a year in and they never fixed it, no matter how much feedback I sent. The best advice they could offer was to factory reset the thing. :(Workaround for this new one is \"Turn on Fire TV\", which is ridiculous and will only work with the linked smart speaker. Support was no real help, but supposedly they escalated the problem. I've heard that before, so won't hold my breath. But at least it stays responsive in standby mode. For now anyway. :)UPDATE: Support indicated that the reason I am having problems with \"Turn on Den TV\" is that I had the Echo Dot linked to another TV previously. Yes, I did and I unlinked that one and linked Den TV. No idea what I was supposed to do differently, but sure seems like a bug.NBD, as I generally just tell it what I want to watch, rather than telling it to turn on. Still would be nice if I could turn it on and off from the other speakers in the house, as I can do with the other two TVs. No idea whether this bug will prevent using routines to turn the den TV on and off, as I haven't tried that yet. They work with the others, except the one that goes into a coma.",
