Was a jvc pro and consumer dealer for many years when the company was under different ownership. Very disappointed! Even phone support leaves much to be desired as it\u2019s outsourced with operators having little product knowledge. They rely on computer screen info thus unable to answer many questions directly! Certainly not the JVC I use to know! Very disappointing indeed!!!",

The sound goes off and isn\u2019t adjustable with the remote and to recover you need to switch to a different program then switch back in the hopes you didn\u2019t miss to much of what they were saying. Now it\u2019s blanking out and you need to switch programs and then come back to what you were watching. Purchased in March and its Mid May without support! It\u2019s June now and we have not made progress on getting a refund for the tv with audio issues!",
