Use your Comcast/Cable/Verizon/Xfinity/Spectrum/Fios remote control for everything else,the network providers do not recognize the manufacturer.Model number of TV was not able to be found. Q: How to use the antenna with Feihe 19 inch tv? A: It all depends on your local reception and where the TV is located in the house\uff08Closer to the window works better\uff09in order to pick up a signal. Use an indoor antenna, but only receive several channels if you live close to mountains and have poor reception without a dish or cable. Other areas, with an antenna are more successful. When the signal is strong the picture is good! Q\uff1aTV not compatible with our cable TV provider? A: First: The cable box needs to support the CEC function Second: Then the cable box should be set to open the CEC function Third: TV under HDMI channel, select MENU->OPTION->HDMI CEC->Select the last DeviceList, search for CEC support Search for the channel, then use Feihe's remote control to remote control the TV box. Q: What if the TV speaker does not work, the screen is broken (or Black / Blue Vertical Line), or the remote control does not work? A: Please contact the seller in time.",

In trying to program my cable remote to the TV (unsuccessfully) I apparently reset my cable box to captions off. Captions now work.Also, the audio out jack cannot be controlled via the menu. if plugged in for our hearing impaired viewer, sound is cut for all others. An optional audio out like an optical connector would be nice to have.I, too, had trouble with the remote. The remote cover does not hold the batteries very snugly and they lose contact. I added a filler inside the cover to provide a more secure fit.The manual says an AV cable is \"supplied\" though it is not list ed as \"in the box\" and I received none.I found the sound from this TV to be a bit louder than the Sanyo it replaced and it works well in my kitchen environment.",

Also, you apparently cannot get a Fire stick remote to control the TV volume and power, which means using two remotes.",

The language barrier was obvious, I finally figured out that the TV defaults to the secondary audio every time you change the channel, regardless of what settings you make in the 'setup' and 'options' and 'sound' menus. So if you're not blind, and you are an English speaker, you will need to re-select English from the 'Audio' button any time you are watching network programming from an off-air antenna. Also, the channel number button layout on the remote is unique, to say the least. I can still use this unit in my RV, but too inconvenient in my kitchen, I will buy a different on for in there.",
