I have 5 tvs on the property all samsung smart tvs ranging from 30 to 60in. I couldn't find a smaller samsung smart tv so I got this. Huge huge huge mistake. It's going back, tho I'll never get back the 3 hours it took of my life waiting for it to update, or the 20 minutes it takes to turn on everytime, or the 3 minutes it takes to go from choosing an app, like Hulu, to the loading screen, which then consistently fails and restarts the tv. The wifi on it sucks. It is literally 1 foot from a net gear night hawk. And only pics up 2 bars, plugged it in via ethernet and it was exactly the same. Complete trash, I can't believe I have to waste my own time to unmount rebox and Shipp this garbage back. Don't make the mistake I did. Just buy a non smart tv, and put Amazon stick or whatever on it.",

It would be nice to have the ability to change the frequency on them so they can be controlled individually. We did figure out how to use the power button on the screen to modify input source as needed so we are ok.",

                "reviewText": "I was on the search for a 1080p 24\" TV for our kitchen and thought I had found it. The TV is nicely designed, the picture is great, and the remote easy to use. The sound was very bad and hard to make out speech with any background noise, music, or sound effects. Half of the shows or movies that I tried I couldn't understand the actors, no matter how loud I turned it up. Very \"tinny\" sound and a tiny speaker with limited range. I thought it was broken so sent it back and Amazon sent a new one. The same problem, so it is a Vizio speaker problem. We listen to the TV more than watch it in the kitchen, so this wasn't going to work. Bought an LG instead.The smart TV works great but it does have one drawback. If you don't see the \"app\" you want on their list, you are out of luck. At the time of this review, it won't let you add additional apps to your list. Most of the popular ones are on there but no PBS or PBS Kids. Not to mention a number of others that we enjoy but you do get Netflix, Prime, VUDU, HULU, Movies Anywhere, CBS, NBC, and a bunch of others.",
