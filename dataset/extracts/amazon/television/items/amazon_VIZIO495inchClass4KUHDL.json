                "reviewText": "I almost returned this TV because I cannot stand Visio's operating system, home screen layout/suck-ass options, and the fact that certain apps (specifically Xfinity Stream) is not available to download. You have to painfully sideload (like with more technical methods than you're thinking because there is no option to allow downloads from unknown sources, or even a web browser app. You would literally have to download the .apk file and install while tethered to a laptop and using debugging programs to get widely used apps like that.... Alternative would be to go through a XBOX or something like that. But my Xbox is in my living room, fire sticks are more valuable to kindle actual fires rather than use for streaming, and I just want to be able to watch cable in my bedroom... But I can't. Visio gets two terds down for doing this. I hope their systems are breached by hackers and they are forced to file corporate bankruptcy.",
