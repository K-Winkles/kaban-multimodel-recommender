The screen seems to be very delicate so I would avoid touching it while putting the legs on. So far it was a great investment for the price.",

                "reviewText": "THE GOOD:Lots of types of input connectors for devices, from modern cable boxes and Blu-ray players to old VCRs, laserdisc machines and DVD players.THE BAD:The picture quality, at least on the unit I received.1) Vertical banding on some shades of gray (blatantly visible when there's no input, and noticeable on some black-and-white programming).2) HMDI video: Any moderately dark part of the image gets crushed to pure black, no matter how you adjust the brightness and contrast. The only way to get a little detail is to boost brightness so much that *nothing* looks black. There's also a less extreme loss of detail at the brighter end of the spectrum. As I said, this is mainly a problem for video coming in via HDMI. By contrast, video coming in through the VGA port showed much less \"crushing.\"Now, some folks will ask \"What did you expect from a cheap monitor?\" But no... I also have several cheap computer monitors that, when hooked up to the same sources, give outstanding video quality with much better depth and clarity. So it's not just about the nature of LED or LCD screens.ALSO NOT GREAT:Remember when digital monitors first came out, and you had to look at them exactly head-on or else the picture looked pale and washed out? This monitor is like that, so it's useless if you're planning to have more than a few people over to watch a movie.On top of everything else, mine showed up with only one leg instead of two. Fortunately I had a stand to mount it on so I could see if the image improved any when the set was at eye level. It didn't.BOTTOM LINE:It makes a wonderful gigantic computer monitor for a VGA-connected device, if that's what you need, since the picture quality is better on its VGA port.It also *might* be good if you need a large cheap TV for the kids' room, but in general I wouldn't recommend it as a TV monitor.",

                "reviewText": "Don't bother - very cheaply made,not a sturdy stand,_legs are very cheap, small and not balanced well, although we have managed to keep it from falling over by duct taping to table) not a great picture quality, and was not working by three months - turned it on the other day, and no picture or audio. Don't waste your money with this cheap off-brand. Seller wouldn't take care of it, as it had been more than 30 days; Square Trade wouldn't take care of the problem, as it is supposedly still under 1 year warranty, and no one answers at the phone number given for Sceptre. I would never buy this TV again, but unfortunately, if we ever get ahold of them, that will probably be our only option is repair or replacement of the same TV. Never again. Nice and cheap, and big, but CHEAP quality.",
