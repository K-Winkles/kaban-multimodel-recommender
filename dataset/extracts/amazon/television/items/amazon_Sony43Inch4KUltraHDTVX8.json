                "reviewText": "This 55 inch X85K replaced my 65 inch X900F from 2019. The 2022 X85k is an upgrade all around.Overall experience:The blacks are more dark, there is no milky haze over the screen. The colors pop and the overall picture seems to be more sharp and detailed. I was able to sell my 65 inch X900F used and got the 85K the very next day for a little more money, so the comparisons are fresh and with the same sources (Apple TV 4K, PS5).The thing about this Sony TV (and other Sony TV)s is that once you see the pictures they produce, it is hard to go back to a different brand, even if it's Samsung or LG. The colors are natural and just seem to produce realness, especially with live sports and nature documentaries. If you watch MMA, Youtube or Netflix a lot, this TV for this price point will be hard to beat. The skin color on people look real. UFC events with all color variations and shades, even of the same color, are noticeable. Sony TVs provide a different dimension to the viewing experience. It is similar to getting a good pair of headphones, and suddenly hear instruments and details you were missing before. This is the best comparison I can come of with.PS5 pairing / Soundbar pairing:This TV is specifically made with focus to compliment other Sony products. You can find complains of people who have problems with Denon or Bose sound systems or receivers.... Well, it's not the case with a Sony sound system. I have the expensive Sony HT-Z9F that is connected to ARC (HDMI3 only!) and my PS5 connected to HDMI 4 (you must!) The TV is able to recognize both in seconds, rename them in the input settings and seamlessly function. I actually just unplugged everything from my old TV and re-plugged in the new TV, without resetting anything, and 0 problems. Actually, the Soundbar seems to work a little better (I am guessing this is due to the 2.1 HDMI signal) compared to the 2.0 HDMI from the old TV. This is a HUGE upgrade also for PS5, because you guessed it, it does natively support 120HZ at 4K. You have to make sure about two things for this to happen:1. Your PS5 (or XBOX X) has to be plugged in to HDMI 3 or 4 (HDMI 4 if you have a ARC capable Soundbar like I do).2. You must go the Input setting for your HDMI in your TV settings and make sure you enable Enhanced with VRR. Do not chose the Dolby option, because that will cut your refresh rate to 60 FPS.I recently bought a 1440p 120 Hz gaming monitor for my Xbox X to run 120 fps and this TV performs equally. You can try games like Rocket League, Need For Speed Unbound and the new Modern Warfare 2 for 120 refresh rate. You will definitely love this TV for PS5 gaming, not just because of the seamless installation and 120 refresh rate, but also interconnection. You can use the remote of the TV to browse the PS5 menus and vice versa. Btw. Make sure you enable VRR in your PS5 settings as well.To conclude (Sony) gaming and (Sony) soundbar experience: this is a 10/10. Everything works seamlessly; 2.1 HDMI works as it should; you can control both with the TV remote.Apple devices:This TV has Airplay 2, which means two great things. One, you can seamlessly connect any Apple devices and mirror your content. And two, you can seamlessly connect any Apple devices and mirror your content :) That means websites of all kinds - WITHOUT an Apple TV. If you have a Mac, iPhone, iPod you will love this TV for the connectivity.Remote:Some people don't agree with removing the numeric buttons, but I dig the new remote a lot. It's much more simple, has GREAT grip due to the patterns on the back casing & have everything you need. If you don't have any other sources, this could easily be your only point of contact with TV. There is a Netflix button, Youtube button and Amazon Prime button. It's also much smaller than the previous generation, which is something Sony had to do to compare to other brands. The numeric and other options ARE available in the Software once you pull up the settings.Negatives:There are 3 negatives with this TV:1. The \"123\" button provides detail information about the resolution, the source and whether HDR is on or not. It's the equivalent to the \"Display\" button from the previous remotes. Unfortunately, it does NOT show you if you are running 60HZ or 120HZ. Considering 120 refresh rate is a key selling point for this TV with the HDMI 2.1 feature, this is a misstep by Sony.2. This is apparently not specific to Sony TVs only, but to any LED panel TVs, but there is a noticeable \"shadow\" or discoloration in the corner of the TV at all times. You will see this when the screen is bright. Once you see it, it is hard to unsee it. Now, to be fair, if you are watching a movie and there is that black bar, you will never notice it. If the screen is filled with color, it is hard to notice. But it is there.... it will be there with other TVs as well, and from what I understand, depends unit to unit how much or how little is it visible. Keep this in mind.3. Sony support is a hit and miss. The PS5 SW support is absolutely horrible. I promised to never buy a Sony product again, but the picture quality keeps me with them. I don't have a bad experience with TV support thus far, but keep this in the back of your mind. Here is where AMAZON support can help more to replace the unit or whatnot, so I highly recommend buying it here.Conclusion:This TV, especially on sale, is a superb investment for the next 5-6 years. There are TVs with better reflection coating or better picture, but they also will be $300+ more. For that money, you can buy a console or a soundbar and get a much better experience. I would always recommend a Sony TV over other brands because of the picture. I am not a Sony fan, but I am a fan of good investments. I really thing this is one of them.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this & I haven't figured everything out. But it has been takingAlot of tuning. My TCL 5 series was much easier to set up. However the main reason I boughtthis was for my Series X. And that's where the TV is incredible. The colors on my games just pop out. But everything is supported. Your games will play at 120 frames per second but they won't display in 4k. They play in 1080 p. So I disabled this feature. I'd rather have 4k at 60 frames per second. The sound is great. I have the 50 inch. My bedroom is small so even turning the volume up half way disturbed my roommates. I don't think a sound bar will be necessary. If you have a new generation console this is the TV you want. I just wish it was easier to operate. Then again I've only had it a day. So I'll get used to it eventually \ud83d\ude42 update. Understand only the HDMI ports 3 & 4 are 2.1 it took alot of personal tuning to get it just right. Thinking about my TCL and this is comparing night & day. Vioce commands come in handy. It has different features that will only work with a ps5. I don't have one so I really can't go into that. But it's perfect for next Gen. Picture quality is just outstanding. But it was at times frustrating to get it how I wanted. Trial & error. But now it's exactly what I was looking for. Only real complaint is there's no direction. The user manual only tells you were to plug it in. How to mount it on a wall. But it doesn't go beyond that. Update 2 months. It looks very bad if you're trying to view it from a angle. I have the 50 inch & I'm right in front. So looks good. From the side \ud83e\udd2e and still I'm messing with settings to get the picture I want. Gaming looks awesome there is a separate setting for that. As far as movies & TV. It's 50 50. You will spend alot of the time getting that picture you want. As far as settings go & making it look the way you want? C- however that's only for tv. Games however this is what is was made for. Everything you want from a next gen console is supported. Just make sure you use hdmi 3 & 4 and enhance. Don't use hdmi 1 & 2 for gaming. They don't support hdmi 2.1. And it doesn't look good from viewing from the side. Game or TV wise. It's a great TV for your games. I'm using a Xbox series X. It supports everything. Except Dolby Vision. That is not a big deal. It makes up for it in others areas. The sound? Still sounds good. Without headphones. It's horrible to tune it. Gaming is a breeze. It's already set for that. Otherwise you might spend awhile getting everything else to look right.",

                "reviewText": "I researched a competitor's TV (LG CANADA SUCKS!!!) for a few months and read the reviews. Finally settled on the top of the line LG OLED 83\" TV. Spent some large money on it! First one showed up in a perfect box. Very bent corner on the TV and broken screen! Can't just pick it up and return it in a small car. Took 2 months of back and forth to get it sent back! I had to find an original box for that model and size so I bought the second same TV. Beautiful for 3 months til the power went out a few times. Pop, no more picture! They sent a repairman multiple times to take \"Pictures\" and third time back to take more pictures, magically there was a \"crack\" about the size of a flea on the right corner? Yup you guessed it! They said I must have broke it and absolved themselves of their \"warranty\" Continued to work the previous 5 times the power went out that day but the sixth time I must have broke it? So much for shopping CANADIAN with a Canadian Company!!! I'm out $6000 and they won't even repair the TV!! But they will help me find a local repair company so I can spend another $4000 To get a new screen! Very nice of them isn't it! So now I have myself this beautiful SONY TV! It's quality is as good or better! A ton more options and free apps, it's Bigger than LG's TV! And the absolutely wonderful thing is? IT WAS HALF THE PRICE OF THE LG TV!!!! So much for shopping CANADIAN!!! Thank You SONY TV! LG? YOU SUCK!!!!",
