                "reviewText": "Bought the first one several months ago, liked it so much that I bought a second one for my bedroom. Clear and detailed picture (when you can see the actor's actual makeup, you know you are getting a sharp image!), and fairly easy to set up (I'm tech challenged). Love that it includes Prime Video, which I use often for both tv and music. I'm on an antenna, no cable here, and the tv's scanner picked up 53 channels. Haven't used the sleep timer yet, but will eventually now that I know where it is. This was a surprisingly good buy (the first one I found on sale for under $200, the second was just a tad over $200) - a lot of tv for the money.",

We also got the TV with the built-in fire TV as we use streaming services for our TV watching. The picture is good for a 1080 HD TV. I have had Toshiba TV's before and this one was what I expected it to be. The initial turn on had me log into my Amazon account which loaded most of the Apps I already subscribe to which made changing to this new TV easy. There were a few Apps I had to manually download and log into, but the majority were loaded at this initial startup. The audio is a bit tinny, but we got an optic audio cable to connect to a surround sound stereo and that audio was good.",

                "reviewText": "The price/value of this TV is good, if you like the Amazon Fire interface. Comes with basic features other similarly prices TVs leave out like USB ports, wired and wireless network connectivity, multiple HDMI, optical audio, etc. This TV is also super lighter weight compared to prior TV generations. First time I\u2019ve been able to carry a 55\u201d TV up stairs and mount it without a requirement to have help (although a second set of hands was helpful). We\u2019ve used it for over a month for streaming video services and connected to a cable box via hdmi. Both look great, although similar to our fire stick, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV platform uses a LOT of data, which is a concern when internet providers have a data cap/overages.We added a cheap wifi access point and locked its uplink to 10Mbps/half + rate throttled it\u2019s port and the TV works great without eating up as much data. We went all the way down to 4Mbps and saw some video artifacts and a short buffer pause starting a movie but not bad enough for us to care.But as others have stated, this TV is horrible for gaming. The refresh rate is POOR. While scrolling around a in-game map there are artifacts and the image looks warped while it\u2019s moving. Doesn\u2019t matter which settings are on/off in the TV, it simply can\u2019t keep up. Sharpness and color is also not great, but overriding the defaults on the TV can help compensate.",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I'm absolutely not someone who is going to nitpick about the picture quality to the point of caring about how truly HD something is. I can tell if the picture is bad or grainy or if there are burned out spots, but otherwise I'm not that concerned about it. What mattered to me is having a TV that made it easier for me to get to everything I have on streaming and to get a slightly better quality than my old TV without paying a lot. This definitely works on those fronts.Navigating settings is pretty straightforward and this thing honestly works pretty decently out of the box. It's not too hard to add a soundbar to this, and odds are good that you'll want to consider one as I'd say the only drawback about this TV I've noticed is that the sound isn't as good as my old one was. Your mileage may vary/tolerance level may as well, but a soundbar fills in that gap nicely. The remote it comes with is honestly pretty much geared to assume you're using Fire to stream (which seems fair - after all, this IS a fire TV, though my Roku would also have plugged in fine if I wanted to keep using it).As I mentioned, the only thing I love less is the sound on this TV and even there it's not a big deal. I'll see how this holds up over time but for now I consider it a pretty good value and wish I'd sprung for it earlier.",
