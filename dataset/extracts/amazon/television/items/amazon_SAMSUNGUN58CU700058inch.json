                "reviewText": "We picked up this 65\" UHD Samsung as an upgrade to existing Samsung in our main room. We have not been disappointed. Setup takes a bit because this technically is an older model but is full of features. If comparing, be sure of model UN65CU7000FXZA. There a couple of versions of this CU7000 series. Ours is the direct back-lit with 3 HDMI ports. Has the older remote but once set up and put in HDR picture mode, you can't beat the picture for the money! We have it hooked to our soundbar we had so no sound concerns. Most large \"flat\" screens need a sound bar if you want the full experience. Happy shopping.",
