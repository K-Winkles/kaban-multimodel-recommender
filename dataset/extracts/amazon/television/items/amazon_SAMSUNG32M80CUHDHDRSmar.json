Have not dove into Bluetooth speakers yet, but it\u2019s disappointing this is the only option. If you\u2019re expecting to use this as a TV and a computer monitor, factor in the cost of decent speakers.Otherwise, the smartOS is fine. Build quality seems decent, but the screen quality is \u2018meh. Not great when viewing at an angle. Honestly, it\u2019s passable for basic computer use and as a secondary TV. Wouldn\u2019t rely on it for everyday streaming. It\u2019s a compromise worth the package to meet a dual purpose need.",

Also, requires a special cable (DP mini to whatever your output is)Very problematic if more than one is in the same location, can only be powered on via a remote, and regardless of where it is pointed...all devices will be controlled. So if one needs to get turned on..it is a safe bet all the other ones will turn off. Have to point the remote down a paper towel roll to manage a single unit. Awful experience.The webcam does NOT work in Windows unless you snake a different USB-C cable to it, when connected as Samsung intended, it only works through the built in OS, which is also quite crap. Awful design. So...my opinion as an IT tech...if you are looking for something that doubles as a TV and a monitor, this is a fair choice. If intent is to use as a PC/laptop display....run in the opposite direction. Awful choice.",
