            "Editorial Reviews From School Library Journal Gr 9 Up-Don't be afraid. Yes, there are drawings of naked bodies in this book (mostly in the \"Body Image\" section), and, yes, readers will learn about some of the ways the human body is wired for pleasure. And the detailed drawings of genitals are not solely in service of explaining how babies are made. But every panel of this book, every anatomical drawing, every conversation over tea or in a tent, is loaded with crucial information about consent, respect, consideration, and boundaries. A magnificently varied cast of characters confess their insecurities to their best friends, siblings, crushes, lovers, and hookups and in return receive reassurance, information, and practical advice. Readers will learn about a laundry list of activities, including sexting, masturbation, gender, and fantasies, along with health issues such as safe sex and a couple of the less pleasant aspects of relationships: jealousy and rejection. Moen and Nolan have been making comics about sex for years-their comic Oh Joy Sex Toy has even been exhibited at the Tate Modern in London. Moen's richly individualistic characters keep the pages turning, despite some fat word balloons-the result of personality-rich dialogue and precision, which is important when it comes to topics like identity and relationships. A palette of browns, pinks, and grays continues the celebration of bodies of all shades and shapes. A sprinkling of profanity (including the odd F-bomb) must be noted as it may affect a school library's ability to shelve it.

                "reviewText": "Love this book! It\u2019s covers the big topics briefly and gives young people a starting point to learn what\u2019s normal about their bodies/feelings/relationships/sexuality. Heavy emphasis is placed on consent and finding what feels right for you (even if that\u2019s not participating in sex at all). I appreciated the mention of how porn has the potential to be destructive and also being conscientious of where you\u2019re sourcing it and the emphasis that porn is a performance and not reality. This book encourages self exploration without pressure and provides emotional/social/physical safety guidelines for those just learning about their sexuality. The brief chapter on fantasizing/kinks was also very concise and clear. Many popular misconceptions are corrected throughout the book. As a 30 year old, I would have LOVED to have this kind of education and validation as I navigated my tween/teen years. Much of the baggage I\u2019m still working through could have been avoided if I had access to this book. I am thankful resources like this exist for young people today.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to read this book due to a small group in my community that wants this removed from the teen/young adult section and instead put in the adult section of the library.Out of context, this book sounds like a terrible choice for a teenager however, after having read it, I find that it's completely appropriate book for the age group it's targeting.It covers a wide rage of topics that the average teen might have questions about. It's informative, and written in a style of how teens would talk to each other.This is perfect for a teenager that's too embarrassed to talk to an adult about the subject matter, or worried that their friends will tease them about not knowing certain information.It's also very repetitive on making sure you have consent with your partner should you choose to do anything together. Within each topic covered this comic encourages teens to be happy in their skin, to love themselves how they are, and to treat others the way they'd like to be treated.It's a very inclusive book, with many of the illustrations showing different disabilities such as one being in a wheelchair, another showing misding limbs or prostheses. Sign language is even depicted in one part.The nude images of the bodies and done in an accurate, yet cartoonish way that's tastefully graphic.I liked this comic and feel comfortable having my 15 year old son read this.",

                "reviewText": "This book has been banned from our Palm Beach County Florida Public Elementary School Libraries. I ordered and read it cover to cover because I was concerned that an educational book on sex with such great reviews and in an appealing graphic novel format was being banned. It is quite explicit, but the artwork (with detailed labels) is informative without being too realistic. It is helpful to know what the correct names of body parts are, as a child or adult. It is difficult to ask questions about body parts if you do not have words for them. There is nothing pornographic (intentionally arousing) about the content. Elementary School seems too young to me, but I believe children have become much more sexually aware and active much younger than when I was a child (b.1945). I am sending this book along to my daughter for her two children (ages 14 and 12) to share with them when she thinks they are ready. It is important for children to know FACTS, not just learn from other children. I can recall my college girlfriends believing that a bottle of Coca-Cola used as an after-sex douche was an effective contraceptive! As well as many other equally incorrect and potentially dangerous ideas about sexual practices.",

                "reviewText": "This book is a \"Just Say Know\" book not a \"Just Say No\" book. If you're uncomfortable with queer and trans people's existence or frankness about sex and masturbation -- this is not the book for you. However, unless you're magically restricting your teens access to the internet and peers, they are getting info -- lots of it (a lot that is inaccurate.) Personally, I think this book does a great job imparting really important information about relationships, boundaries/consent, desire, and handling rejection. It also has section of porn and sexting because whether or not parents want to think about it, kids are familiar with both.So be forewarned.But I think this is a great book for some difficult and complex subjects that are definitely on young people's minds whether they themselves are actually particularly interested in sex and dating or not.",

This book is definitely too old for him right now, but he is very good at reading and researching at the level that\u2019s right for him.He knows I have the answers and if he doesn\u2019t want to hear me say it, he now knows that this book covers it for him.It\u2019s in his bedroom, he picks it up and puts it down. Last night he told me that he read a page he didn\u2019t understand. It was about intersex and so we opened the pages and talked about it together. We talked about how one day one of his friends may feel like this. They may even confide in him. He said it would be a hard conversation but now he would be ready and would understand instead of feeling weird or laughing.Then he closed the book and talked about Sonic the hedgehog.This book delivers in a way that he understands and makes things matter of fact. I wish it had existed when I was young. I\u2019m ashamed of how little I understood about people who were \u2018different\u2019 to me.",

Super inclusive, and each rtopics is told through little stories between the characters.I love that it's not just about sex and bodies, too. There's a lot about HOW to navigate the social aspects of relationships, jealousy, and emotions.Now if I could only get my teens to not be TOO embarrased to read it...",
