            "Editorial Reviews Review The book is very well written, and absolutely perfect. It even made farts seem awesome. Readers will want to impress everyone with their new-found fart facts.-Readers' Favorite reviews (5 stars) About the Author M.D. Whalen was always the kid who sat in the back of the class scribbling stories and cartoons. Later he sat in front of the class scribbling stories, when he should have been teaching! Now he writes full time in the back of his house, and has published many books under other names. He also enjoys cycling, world travel, and making rude noises in different languages."

Our whole family was laughing Christmas morning especially at the Synonym's for farts.......\"Crack Concert, Bean Blower, Sphincter Song, Butt Burp\" etc. The illustrations were cute also. Great little book for a boy family for sure!",
