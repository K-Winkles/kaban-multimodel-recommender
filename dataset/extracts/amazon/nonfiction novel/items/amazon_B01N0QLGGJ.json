I find a few of the selections very appealing and know that I will come back to some others that challenge me (as I have with past volumes) and discover something I admire. I\u2019m happy I ignored the very negative reviews of this volume. I rarely rate purchases on Amazon and truthfully probably wouldn\u2019t give this one five stars, but for the fact that I feel the average rating should be a bit higher. Sure, some of the art is \u201csloppy\u201d and some the writing is less than linear. That doesn\u2019t make it bad. Katchor, himself, I found to be a bit of an acquired taste.",

                "reviewText": "This was a good, solid collection of comics, perhaps featuring more low key and nebulous stories than usual compared to other years, but mostly fully deserving of recognition. My only disagreement in quality was with one particular political piece which was not really creative and pretty tasteless. But generally I thought this collection was quite enjoyable. I wouldn't pass it up.I think it's worth noting that you should look closely at the bad reviews before accepting them at face value. One or two have valid complaints, but the others have misapplied and/or are politically motivated. America's Best collections are not governed by any other pretense than the quality of the material speaking for itself. This isn't a some game where everyone wins a gold star just for participating. If equal representation among social, sexual, or racial demographics is your only real concern, then a \"best of\" collection is not what you are looking for. This collection features work that speaks for itself regardless of creator classifications or social identifications.",

Okay, so I liked it a little bit better - I really appreciated that guest editor Ben Katchor made an effort to present a lot more self-published comics - books that I would otherwise never have gotten a chance to see. One of my gripes about previous year's books is that they feature the same indie comic book titans years after year... yes, I know that Clowes and Crumb and Ware are great... but the I feel the point of these anthology books is not to just show the same artists but give exposure to newer and lesser known artists working in this field.",

Ease of read was affected not only by the small size of the lettering in many of the comics, but also overall muddled quality of the printings. Color comics appeared washed out. Many of the excerpts were simply not enough to get a feel for what the larger comic was about. For what it's worth, I found 2016's BAC collection leaps and bounds better and found many new forever favorites because of it.",

                "reviewText": "A particularly bad volume of the Best American Comics series. These are usually pretty good, but Ben Katchor's guest editing is atrocious. Female comics creators are wholly underrepresented (5 of the 34 comics in this volume were created by women) and that is totally unacceptable. It's not like women aren't creating comics, in fact, they're creating some of the best comics. You can see some listed in the appendix of other notable works. That Katchor, a middle aged man, decided to fill this volumes primarily with comics by other middle aged men is a huge bummer. This series is a great platform for comics artists and graphic novelists to get noticed, and here I am reading almost 20 page of Kim Deitch while people like Lillie Carre, Eleanor Davis, and Jillian Tamaki sit on the sidelines. That colossal issue aside, the comics that did make it into this volume are either A.) Old timey and out of touch or B.) The sort of avant-garde navel gazing stuff that is weird for the sake of weirdness. Gabrielle Bell and Joe Sacco's entries were the lone bright spots here. Let's just hope series editor Bill Kartalopoulos does a better job finding a competent guest editor for next year's edition (and provides at least some modicum of oversight to make sure the comics being represented are actually, you know, representative of the comics being made in a given year).",
