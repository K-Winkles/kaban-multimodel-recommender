I was constantly putting in book marks on ones I thought were really fun or extra interesting. All the stories were only about 2 or so pages so I could stop and start through out the book. I tell some of the stories to my grandchildren and adults. One of the stories answers the question of where they came up with the name Teddy Bear, which was funny as we (grandchildren and i) had just been trying to figure it out. There is mentioned in some other reviews that it was not appropriate for younger children (8 or so). There were several stories that might upset some children that are those ages or under. They would be things that might cause them to worry or get frightened. My suggestion is to read it first, then read it to the children excluding those stories. There are so many other great stories they will love and they all are great to discuss. No matter the age I love to read to others and they love to listen to me read. Enjoy.",
