        "description": "Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and biblical scholar who was known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings in an era dominated by opposing theological traditions. Pink was one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century. Pink\u2019s beliefs and teachings were largely Calvinist and Puritan based. \"The Sovereignty of God is an expression that once was generally understood. It was a phrase commonly used in religious literature. It was a theme frequently expounded in the pulpit. It was a truth which brought comfort to many hearts, and gave virility and stability to Christian character. But, today, to make mention of God\u2019s sovereignty is, in many quarters, to speak in an unknown tongue\"..A.W. Pink This is one of Pink's most powerful and well known works. A must read..

The Sovereignty of the God of Scripture is absolute, irresistible, infinite.\"\"And all we can say is 'Our God is in the heavens, He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased' (Psalm 115:3).\"\"...God does rule, actually rule, and that His government extends to and is exercised over all things and all creatures....Two alternatives confront us, and between them we are obliged to choose: either God governs, or He is governed; either God rules, or He is ruled; either God has His way, or men have theirs....We read the Scriptures in vain if we fail to discover that the actions of men, evil men as well as good, are governed by the Lord God....It is clear from Scripture, then, that the angels, good and evil, are under God's control, and willingly or unwillingly carry out God's purpose.\"\"It is God Himself who maketh the difference between the elect and the non-elect, for of His own it is written, 'And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true' (1 John 5:20). Faith is God's gift, and 'all men have not faith' (2 Thessalonians 3:2); therefore, we see that God does not bestow this gift upon all....the ultimate destiny of every individual is decided by the will of God, and blessed it is that such be the case; if it were left to our wills, the ultimate destination of us all would be the Lake of Fire.\"\"'The sum of the Apostle's answer here is, that the grand object of God, both in the election and the reprobation of men, is that which is paramount to all things else in the creation of men, namely, His own glory' (Robert Haldane)....Our business is not to reason about it, but to bow to Holy Scripture. Our first duty is not to understand, but to believe what God has said.\"\"What then was the great purpose for which this world and the human race were created? The answer of Scripture is, 'The LORD hath made all things for Himself' (Proverbs 16:4). And again, 'Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created' (Revelation 4:11). The great end of creation was the manifestation of God's glory.\"\"Nowhere does Scripture speak of the freedom or moral ability of the sinner, on the contrary, it insists on his moral and spiritual inability. ...Man is responsible to (first) acknowledge before God his inability, and (second) to cry unto Him for enabling grace....If he will do so, sincerely from the heart, then most surely God will respond to his appeal, for it is written, 'For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved' (Romans 10:13).\"",

                "reviewText": "God is the creator of all things visible and invisible. He is omniscient and omnipotent, and He is over all things. He is The Sovereign King over all. A.W. Pink, point-by-point, shows that God is greater than our hearts and minds can imagine. God is not small and He doesn't fit into our finite thoughts, nor does He bow to the whims and idolatries of any society. He is not \"reduced to the level of the creature\"; God is greater than all. To quote Pink, \"One of the most flagrant sins of our age is that of irreverence - the failure to ascribe the glory which is due the august majesty of God. Men limit the power and activities of the Lord in their degrading concepts of His being and character.\" Yet God isn't limited simply because many have chosen an idol (a god to suit themselves). For if God isn't sovereign over everything, then He isn't God. But He is God, and He is sovereign! Many insist that God is limited by man's so-called 'free will'. Pink, after noting the 'free will' of the men of Babel, of Pharoah, Balaam, Saul, Jonah, Nebuchadnezzar, and Herod, then states, \"Yes, my reader, and you, too, had a will when you first formed your plans without first seeking counsel of the Lord, therefore did He overturn them! 'There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand' (prov 19:21)\" While focusing primarily on God's sovereignty (after all, it is the subject of this book), Pink doesn't negate spelling out each man's own responsibility. This book is definitely 5+ stars. I've already recommended it to friends. Those who took the time to read it praised it highly and have, in turn, recommended it to others. Get the unabridged version. The reader will have to pause often to consider the awesomeness of the God who calls each star by name and knows the number of hairs on our heads. Hopefully, the reader will be able to say, as did Paul, \"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgements and unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the LORD, or who became His counselor? Or who has first given to Him that it might be paid back to him again? For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.\" (Rom 11:33-36)",

                "reviewText": "Every believer should make time to read Pink's classic work on the Sovereignty of God. Pink aims and succeeds in exhalting God above the heavens and proves from the inspired Word that God is not some helpless bystander watching world events randomly taking place before our eyes. No!, He is orchestrating these events for His own purposes.The blessed assurance that a believer can receive from an understanding of God's Sovereignty is well, beyond calculation.This work elevates God and puts man where he belongs-in the dust. This doctrine, sadly many shy away from, but it is there in the pages of Scripture to those whom God has opened their eyes to see.The one thing I must disagree with Pink on is on page 175 (Kindle) or 470 in \"The Wisdom of Arthur W Pink vol 1\" where he says \"...that all our works (before conversion), good as well as evil, count for nothing toward salvation.\" It MUST be a typo error, as surely \"all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\" Isaiah 64.6 even before and after conversion?I understand that Pink was raised in Dispensationalism, subsequently came to reject it and wrote against it, yet had some strange views about prophecy regarding the Lord's Second Advent in his \"Reedemer's Return\" (Not recommended reading!) This I do not say lightly, and with the utmost regret, because I value highly all his other works, but then, even the Puritans, whom he studied voraciously had a dim light compared to us today), this no doubt came about from his earlier Dispensational leanings.Having said this, he was a most voluminous writer, and well, no man is perfect,(the Saviour aside!) but certainly his soteriology is biblical.",
