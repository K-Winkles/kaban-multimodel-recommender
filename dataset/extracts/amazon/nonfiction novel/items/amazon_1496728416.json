                "reviewText": "Anyone interested in World War II history, especially as it unfolded in Britain and France, will find Alan Hlad's novel , \"Churchill's Secret Messenger\" well researched and, for the most part, a satisfying read until its final chapters. Rose Teasdale, a composite of several heroic Englishwomen mentioned by name in the author's source notes, is parachuted into Nazi occupied France as part of the British effort to establish a support system for the French Resistance. Having lost her brother, shot down over the English Channel, and both her parents during the London blitz, she is determined to see the Nazis defeated regardless of any cost to herself. A small woman, she survives the training course as much by her wits as by her physical abilities, which are challenged. With her fluent French, she assumes the role of a bicycling cosmetic saleswoman as her cover.While the narrative is at times riveting, it is also predictable from beginning to end, becoming a question of not if, but when and who will be captured and who will escape, who will survive torture, imprisonment and the concentration camps and who does not.Moreover, it is the writing itself that is too often flawed, with repetitive phrases:( \"the hair stood up on the back of her neck\" by my count appearing eight times; it might be more) and with the use of inappropriate words at the wrong time. Rose endures unimaginable fear and hardships, some self inflicted, many times directly involving her stomach in extreme ways, yet the author rarely if ever uses the word \"stomach\" or \"gut\" when describing her suffering, but rather childish and minimizing words such as her \"tummy\" or \"belly.\" It is jarring when the circumstances are intense. In a concentration camp,Rose is asked to take a letter from a dying mother to her child, and Rose collects the paper from cigarette butts to take it down, with each scrap numbered for later reconstruction. The letter, when eventually read to the child, goes on for paragraphs, in heartfelt prose unlikely to have been dictated by one in extremis and at a length that would have required more than a carton's worth of cigarette butts.In it's final chapters, mawkishly drawn out when the outcome is never in doubt, absurdities abound. Spoiler alert: Rose desperately seeks to reunite with someone who works for a Paris newspaper, La Chronique. It is September 5, 1945 a hectic newsday when the Japanese surrender is taking place and the meeting is inconclusive. She returns to the newspaper offices later, \"after business hours\" to find the building dark and the entrance door locked. When does any newspaper ever close up and lock its doors, especially on the most newsworthy day in half a decade?If one can get past nonsense such this, the reader will find it to be both a somber yet exciting read.",
