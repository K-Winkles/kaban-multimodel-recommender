                "reviewText": "I have encountered books in my long reading life that I could not put down once I started them. I began Bloomsbury Girls at breakfast time and, in between other chores, finished it just after midnight. Natalie Jenner\u2019s second novel is so compellingly written that it carried me along to the happy conclusion. Jenner\u2019s first novel, The Jane Austen Society, is a highly fictionalized account of the founding of the original literary society devoted to Austen; this first book is full of what dramaturgists and screenwriters call \u201cEaster Eggs,\u201d in this case, sly references to the plots and characters of Austen\u2019s six novels. Bloomsbury Girls continues the story of Evie Stone, a character who in her role as a female servant at Chawton Manor, catalogued the extensive library there. Austen herself was familiar with the books that were there during her lifetime because Chawton was one of two great estates owned by her older brother Edward Austen Knight. Upon the death of the bailiff of Chawton Manor, Edward bestowed Chawton cottage on his impoverished, widowed mother, his two sisters, and their best friend Martha Lloyd. It was at Chawton Cottage that Austen lived from July, 1809 to her death in July, 1817; it was there that Austen revised her first three manuscript novels and wrote three more novels. The Jane Austen Society (both in Jenner\u2019s first novel and in real life) was formed to purchase, renovate, and open that cottage to the public as the Jane Austen House Museum. Evie Stone\u2019s meticulous cataloging of the books at Chawton Manor allowed the novel\u2019s members to buy the library which they then resold at a substantial profit, the monies from which went to purchase the cottage and fund its renovation. Jenner\u2019s second novel follows Evie Stone\u2019s early life. from her graduation with top honors from Cambridge, her failure to get a research fellow\u2019s position due to male chauvinism among the faculty and students, and her landing at Bloomsbury Books in London as a shop girl, making seven pounds per week in 1950. Evie is fascinated with the writing of late eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century women writers; her fascination is the biggest \u201cEaster Egg\u201d in the novel because Chawton Manor which was sold by the Knight family to a developer who wanted to turn it into a golf course; when that scheme fell through, an American fan of Austen, Sandy Lerner, bought a 99-year lease, extensively renovated the building, and established the Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing (CSEEWW). Because of the setting of Jenner\u2019s second novel (Bloomsbury section of London), there are many \u201cEaster Eggs\u201d relating to authors, especially women authors. While perhaps only English majors will recognize the many sly references, the casual readers will nonetheless find in Evie Stone\u2019s story her successful efforts to pull herself up by her own bootstraps\u2014a theme much beloved by Americans who may not have read Horatio Alger\u2019s stories themselves but who have imbibed from the American culture a love of such a story line. Bloomsbury Girls is a well-written, intelligent, heart-warming story of success in overcoming tremendous odds. I heartily recommend it to any sensitive reader.",

                "reviewText": "Bottomline: This is a charming and interesting story. The setting in a long-established bookstore in London and the early 1950\u2019s postwar time frame add interest, but it is the characters that will make you want to sit and read. The main characters all work in the bookstore. The focus is on three women, Grace, Vivien, and Evie. Each of them has different talents and each of them has different reasons for working in at Bloomsbury Bookstore, but they share the same status and limitations as women. The women are surrounded by well-defined supporting characters. The supporting characters include the men associated with the bookstore and women who are customers, allies, and sometimes celebrities. It is fun to have writers Daphne DuMaurier and Samuel Beckett show up in the narrative at key times. The book is a very pleasant read. There are tensions and complications, but the overall tone of the book is not stressful. The writing is good, and the pacing is steady. Because the narrative is always moving forward, the pages turn quickly. I purchased this book on a Kindle deal so the ratio of price to entertainment value was very good. It is a book that would be worth even the regular the full purchase price.",

                "reviewText": "Natalie Jenner's second novel is set in London in 1950, and explores the lives of three women working in the male-dominated bookshop Bloomsbury Books. Evie (from Jenner's first novel 'The Jane Austen Society') has left Cambridge after failing to get the research fellowship she deserved. She's now on the track of a first edition of Jane Webb's 'The Mummy!', one of the very first science fiction novels, which she believes to be in the shop. Vivien longs to raise the profile of female authors within the bookshop - and to write fiction herself. And Grace is thankful for a job that takes her away from her increasingly unstable and bullying husband. Gradually, the three women begin to realize that they can work together to achieve a richer future both for the bookshop and for each other.The setting of 'Bloomsbury Girls' is excellent, and I rather liked Jenner's idea of bringing in real-life literary figures. There's lots of potential in the plot too, especially the cross-cultural love affair between Evie and Ash Ramaswamy, the search for a rare first edition, and Vivien's gradual realization that she is a writer as well as a keen reader. But somehow, I failed to fully warm to 'Bloomsbury Girls'. What I really liked about 'The Jane Austen Society' (despite my reservations) was its original and very moving main topic: how great writers and great works of literature can heal people who've been badly hurt. Here, Jenner seems almost entirely concerned with highlighting the sexism and racism of the 1940s and 50s. She spends so much time telling us (repeatedly) about Evie's adverse experiences in academe, Vivien's lack of success in a male-dominated publishing world, and Grace's marital woes, that she neglects other important aspects of their life, such as Evie's growing attraction to Ash (their relationship is very rushed over), Vivien's feelings about the loss of her fiance in World War II, Grace's back story and her relationship with her sons (bar that one scene at Hamley's) and, most importantly, the women's friendship, which we never really see develop. Nor, other than Evie's obsession with Jane Webb and Vivien getting friendly with Daphne Du Maurier and gushing a bit at Samuel Beckett's daring, do we get much of a sense of the books and authors that inspire these three women. All this means that they are less interesting than they should be, and too often seem vehicles through which the author can explore feminine oppression.As for the men, with the exceptions of Ash and Lord Baskin (both lovely characters, but both very underdeveloped) they are all weak, bullying or wildly egotistical. For the most part they are also extremely incompetent, and very sexist. This feels increasingly contrived, especially as regards Alec, who seems to only exist in the story for the author to tell us endlessly how narrow-minded he is, and how inferior he is to Vivien. Jenner created a few lovely male characters in 'The Jane Austen Society', especially Adam and Andrew, and I found the endless men-bashing here got tedious, as did the author's need to point out incidents of sexism (and various other isms) in virtually every chapter. Yes, the 1950s were sexist, but not every man was an ineffectual or brutal misogynist, and not every woman was brave, clever and resourceful. Some women were even pretty awful to their own sex. And on a related note - I'm afraid I found Vivien's mixture of self-righteousness and yearning for male attention quite irritating. She came across as a narcissist, which I don't think was intended.Although I wasn't scanning the book for historical inaccuracies, there were also a few things about the introduction of real-life literary figures that didn't feel quite right. Daphne Du Maurier - as anyone who has read Margaret Forster's biography will realize - was no feminist, and actually had quite a sexist approach to high-achieving women. (She was also very ungenerous towards younger female writers.) So she'd have been very unlikely to become a great friend of Vivien, or to have supported the girls' endeavours. Sonia Orwell tended to refer to herself by that name rather than 'Sonia Blair' or 'Sonia Brownell Blair', and (from what I've read) would probably have called her husband 'George' (his adopted name) rather than his real name of Eric. I couldn't quite imagine these two and Peggy Guggenheim teaming up to become friends, and wondered (though I don't really know enough about him to judge) whether Samuel Beckett appeared a bit too cheerful! I'd also query Evie's statement that the heyday of women's fiction was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries - what about George Eliot, Mrs Gaskell and Mrs Oliphant? Or Rebecca West, Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf et al?There were things that I enjoyed in this book - the two love affairs are sweet, and some of the writing on books and on 1950s culture was quite interesting. But - like quite a number of contemporary novels - it tended to prioritise polemic (in this case feminist polemic) over well-rounded characters and a satisfying plot. Which for me made it, for all its good points, slightly dull.",
