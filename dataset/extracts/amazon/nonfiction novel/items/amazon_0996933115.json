Her language is easy to understand, it flows, it feels natural and like she understands my struggles as a first time writer. My biggest take away is i need structure, a system but i've read so many that made me anxious, including one that said if i'm truly dedicated i can write an entire first draft in a weekend, in 3 days, so when i failed at that, my confidence was in question. Her system, time frame, and of course excel spreadsheet (nerd in me is geeked) for the more realistic process of like 12-16 weeks, feels way better and with less anxiety I'm a better writer, go figure.",

I\u2019ve actually never thought of publishing anything non-fiction, but settling down with this book (accidentally picked because I thought it was about writing a novel) has inspired me to reconsider. At the same time, I found that it also has inspired me to write that novel I\u2019ve always wanted to write as well. Though not completely aligned, I feel like writing fiction applies to most of the points in this book, such as the need to not self-sabotage, form writing habits that work for you, etc. Overall the book was also easy to read and includes decent resources.",

                "reviewText": "Morgan is a coach to authors and in this book she gives you the same advice that clients pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to get.This book starts out with a bang by destroying the myths that keep people from writing a book. In fact, I just published my first book a few months ago and I wish I had this book years ago. I believe I would have published my book long ago, rather than be paralyzed with the myths Morgan breaks down. For example, I believed I had to write every day, have special connections or be lucky. A lot of these and more are false as you'll read.To quote Morgan, \"..writing is a battle. That battle will be won or lost in your own head. If you believe writing is something only for special people with lots of time, talent, connections, and money, I can tell you right now that you'll never write a book\". Amen Morgan! Fortunately, I broke through and wrote my book, but by reading this book and believing it, it will take less time and angst for you to write yours!I loved the support/self sabotage and writing habits chapters, as they are ripe with nuggets of wisdom that will help you write unfettered. In fact, the writing habits chapter alone is worth the price of the book, regardless of what it is when you read this review!Finally, you learn about editing and dealing with criticism, a big chapter that all writers struggle with, but like anything, those who can learn from the criticism, rather than taking it personally will have success, I guarantee it!Your writer appetite will be satiated with Morgan's advice, but then you get to the dessert, which are the appendices. You get a tracking spreadsheet (critical), how to do a reverse outline (saves your bacon and ensures there aren't holes or \"run on writing\" and finally a reviewers feedback form. These items are valuable of themselves, but to be included in the book just makes it the sweet topping of a writing advice smorgasbord!I'm following Morgan's advice as I write my second book right now and the process is so much smoother as a result. Get this book, whether you want to write your first book or fiftieth. You can do it and Morgan is giving you the help and encouragement you need!",

                "reviewText": "Morgan\u2019s book, \u201cStart Writing Your Book Today\u201d is just what I need at this time. I\u2019m a beginner writer who has a desire to write and ideas to share. Morgan gives direct answers to those questions that every writer struggles with and she gives us all reasons to continue our dream. In a friendly and charming way, she offers advice and experiences from having \u201cbeen there and done it\u201d.After first watching the many YouTube and Periscopes that she has so graciously given, I started reading her blog and although the information is valuable enough to be watched over and over, it is her book that puts the information into an easy to learn format.\u201cStart Writing Your Book Today\u201d will empower the writer by telling the truth. It will tell you that writing is hard work, but that if your desire is strong enough, and if you follow Morgan\u2019s directions, you can publish a book of your own. The book will lead you from chapter one\u2019s \u201cWhat it really takes to be a successful author\u201d to chapter seven\u2019s \u201cFinished manuscript\u201d.When I\u2019m a bit further down the road with my story, I hope to use her editorial services because Morgan has become my teacher. I only hope that she will be able to fit me in once this book becomes more popular!I have written several children's books combining stories and sign language, but as I venture towards writing for adults I need the advice that Morgan provides. My children's books are at Randall Clarkson I can\u2019t recommend \"Start Writing Your Book Today\" more. As I proceed from writing idea to publish I will be constantly referring back to Morgan\u2019s book. Yes, I will be continuing to follow her on Periscope and YouTube and I can\u2019t wait for her next book.",
