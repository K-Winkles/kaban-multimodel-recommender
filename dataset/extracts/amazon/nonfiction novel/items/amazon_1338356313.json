I chose this one because I had read his former book, \"Hey Kiddo\". I enjoyed this book even more and can't wait for my students to read it. This is the author's true story of a year in high school when he worked at a summer camp for students who had cancer. The way he was able to inspire those he worked with was amazing. What was more amazing was the way these kids inspired and changed his life. It is not an easy book to read due to the topic. I found myself moved to tears throughout the book. The author doesn't sugar coat things, not even his own tough life. He was raised by his grandparents. The reasons can be found by reading this book. I highly recommend it",

                "reviewText": "Jarrett Krosoczka has mastered the art of graphic novel memoir and I highly recommend both of his books in this category. Sunshine was a great follow-up to Hey Kiddo, picking up during Jarrett's senior year of high school when he spent a week volunteering at a camp for kids with severe illnesses. It is abundantly clear how much this experience changed Jarrett's outlook on life, and I absolutely love that he tells us the student volunteers were chosen by lottery and he was one of the lucky few. It was truly meant to be. And now readers everywhere will get to know the children that changed Jarrett's life through this graphic novel. It's heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once. Just like life.",

                "reviewText": "This book is an offhoot story from the same author/artist's memoir -- Hey, Kiddo. With the newer title sharing the same comic book/graphic novel style as the prior memoir, this was again a fast read for me. Here Jarrett, in high school, volunteered to be a counselor at a camp for youths limited by cancer and similar illnesses. The camp acted as a respite not only for these kids and teens, but for their families as well.Jarrett's adoptive grandma appeared early in the story and, to my relief, came across much less abrasive than in Hey, Kiddo. Nonetheless, she revealed her own assumptions that the camp would end up a depressing setting for her grandson.While there was some sadness, the story also recounted how the camp kids (and volunteers) established camaraderie and risked leaving their comfort zones. One standout character made obvious his fandom of the 1990s Power Rangers. I was also impressed to see one participant family at the camp code-switching in Spanish/English.",

It shows how lifechanging the experience can be for the campers and also the staff.The book really spoke to me as a Camp Director. I can really relate to this book and its message. At camp you really do have a powerful opportunity to bring joy to those who may otherwise not find it, and the bonds you create at camp are very very special.I would say that its audience would be for families who are thinking about whether or not to take an opportunity to be more involved in a community. It could also be for anyone who is serving a community since it speaks to how great helping others can help yourself.",

I went there for 16 years. Spent weeks of my summer volunteering and spending my weekends with \u201cpapa\u201d and his wife. I knew who \u201cJoy\u201d was right away, she was an amazing person and volunteer and had so much love to give. Thank you for allowing me to reminisce, laugh and cry.

                "reviewText": "Novela gr\u00e1fica de hechos reales, entretenida y de buen contenido. En Estados Unidos, en los a\u00f1os 90, un joven participa en un campamento de una semana para ni\u00f1os con c\u00e1ncer o problemas de salud, al cual tambi\u00e9n van sus familias. Pero no es una historia dibujada o escrita para dar l\u00e1stima. Al contrario, muestra divertidas aventuras, con bromas y tambi\u00e9n con realismo. Y hace pensar. Es una estupenda lectura para j\u00f3venes que van a ir o a organizar un campamento, o para j\u00f3venes con alguna enfermedad y sus familiares que se identificar\u00e1n con los personajes.",
