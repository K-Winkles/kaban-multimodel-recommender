                "reviewText": "This is my very first graphic novel of any sort, so this is my intro to the medium. The quality of the book is nice and each page is in full color. Other reviewers have said that the artwork is hastily done, I am not experienced enough with graphic novels to know, but I enjoyed the pictures nonetheless.The \"story\" follows a British soldier and his journey from 1914 to the end of the war. It is a Forrest Gump adventure in which the character was either there, or he was almost there, or he mentions a significant event and how it affected him. As a result, the book does not flow at all. One page you are in France, then the Middle East, then Russia. And the scenes on each page lack a lot of dialoug and are disjointed in the action sequences. Also, some of the images are duplicated (sometimes even on the same page), and I found more than a few typos (missing commas and \"here\" instead of \"hear\"). Like I said, I haven't read any other graphic novels, but this looks like low quality work because I can tell the \"BLAM\"s and \"BANG\"s, and the speech bubbles are added via computer. They stand out from the page and takes away from the immersion. I don't know if all comics do this, but I hope not.I would have expected more information about the war since the \"story\" was so poor, but it was just a gereral overview. I think the best part was the beginning with the assassination of Ferdinand. I had high hopes after that but the rest was kinda meh.I read it twice. So even with all my issues, it wasn't that bad. I'm planning on buying the WW2 ones as well.",
