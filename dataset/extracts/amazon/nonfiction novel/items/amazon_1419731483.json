My son read it cover-to-cover in one long sitting. It was blissful to have a night of family reading time, and not even a hint of asking for screen time. Each book in the Hazardous Tales series has enthralled my son. I give these books to parents of his friends that are trying to find the right \"hook\" to get their kids to enjoy reading. My kid is a history buff and these books really speak to his interest. If anyone can recommend other series of a similar vein, I'm all ears! In the meantime, this will be read over and over again, and we will not-so-patiently await Nathan Hale's next project!",

                "reviewText": "I love this series and I really loved this installment! I'm typically not really into Revolutionary War stories because it was a war that meant freedom for some and not others, but I enjoyed this one because Lafayette was such a dynamic and fun character, truly an adventure and battle seeker. And it felt like this was one of the more understandable story arcs, not confusing at all. Though I do think the author could be better about tracking dates throughout, or making sure there's a recent date marker if a year is randomly mentioned in the narrative. Also, it's cool to see the artwork get better and tighter as the series goes on. Looking forward to learning what the next book topic will be.",

This graphic novel covers Lafayette's early life through the end of the American Revolutionary War. My favorite effect of a Hazardous Tale is that it gets my 7 and 9 year old interested in learning more about the subjects Mr. Hales covers. They went and looked up the rest of Lafayette's amazing life story after the American Revolution. I hope that part of the his tale can be told by Mr. Hale in the future. Can't wait for more!",
