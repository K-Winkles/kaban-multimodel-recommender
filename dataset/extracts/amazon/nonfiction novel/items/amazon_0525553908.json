        "description": "A National Book Award Finalist, this remarkable graphic novel is about growing up in a refugee camp, as told by a former Somali refugee to the Newbery Honor-winning creator of Roller Girl.Omar and his younger brother, Hassan, have spent most of their lives in Dadaab, a refugee camp in Kenya. Life is hard there: never enough food, achingly dull, and without access to the medical care Omar knows his nonverbal brother needs. So when Omar has the opportunity to go to school, he knows it might be a chance to change their future . . . but it would also mean leaving his brother, the only family member he has left, every day.Heartbreak, hope, and gentle humor exist together in this graphic novel about a childhood spent waiting, and a young man who is able to create a sense of family and home in the most difficult of settings. It's an intimate, important, unforgettable look at the day-to-day life of a refugee, as told to New York Times Bestselling author/artist Victoria Jamieson by Omar Mohamed, the Somali man who lived the story.",

It's a graphic novel that can be easily read by ages 8+, but the content would make more sense for the 12-15+ age group. I read it as an adult, and absolutely adored it, so it really does appeal to all ages and is a book that you could read multiple times over your life and glean new things from it each time.",

                "reviewText": "This is a a beautiful story about two Somalian refugee brothers who have not given up hope on finding their mother or being reassigned to America. It\u2019s a story about human grit and resilience that is difficult to really hit home for many American children, but the stunning illustrations carry this message through-out the story. My 9-year-old struggled to get into the first chapter, but when I sat down and read it to her, she was hooked. We almost finished the entire book in two reading sessions. This book gave me an opportunity to expose my daughter to diversity and examine the conditions of her own life. During this quarantine pandemic, my daughter has had to face some difficult changes in our family structure and sell her home. This book was a lesson to her to hold on to the ones she loves, and remember how lucky she is to be sleeping in a soft bed, eating nutritious, abundant food, and receiving free quality education. My daughter was particularly stunned about the refugee girls who don\u2019t have choices about whom they marry and whether or not they go to school. I whole-heartedly recommend this book to any graphic novel enthusiast, or just anyone. Parents, read it to your child and talk with them about the similarities and differences of their life to Omar and Hassan\u2019s. Thank you, Omar, for sharing your life story with the world and for organizing Refugee Strong so we can help. Please, Jamieson, find more diverse stories like this to capture and I will buy every one of them.",
