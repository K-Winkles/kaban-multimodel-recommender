                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Necessary Dose of Perspective on the Middle East",
                "reviewText": "I have taught this book to my tenth grade English students for the past five years, and I believe it has helped to send my former students into society as informed adults with enough perspective to see Iranian people as fellow global citizens, not Middle Eastern enemies. Satrapi wrote the book to inform people about the Islamic Revolution and to give readers an insider perspective. I know that the book was originally written in French, and then later translated to English, which are the main languages of the Western world. This points to her intended audience - Westerners. Satrapi was trying to show the Western world what Iranian people are really like -- not extremists, not radical Muslims - but mostly peace-loving, creative, independently thinking people who value their Persian culture and lifestyle and have suffered greatly for remaining in their homeland in spite of the challenges. Throughout the book, she paints herself as religiously moderate and politically involved, even as a child, and not at all negative towards the West. With images of the Iranian hostage crisis in the back of our minds, it is easy for Americans to assume that all Iranians hate Americans, but this is far from true. Satrapi shows her love for Western culture and music and books with Michael Jackson and Kim Wilde and Iron Maiden. She mostly clearly demonstrates the impact of their suffering with how drastically the loss of her Uncle Anoosh impacted her. She also wants people to have the facts about the revolution as well, which we see in the wealth of historical information integrated into her memoir. I personally believe that Satrapi was very effective in helping society see Iranians differently, mostly from my personal experience. Before reading this book six years ago, I assumed that if the theocracy remains in power, that must mean that the majority of people in Iran must be really religious and anti-West, or else why wouldn't they overthrow their government? This book helped me see that they are really suffering under a different kind of tyranny, and also helped me understand why it happened. She shows why they overthrew the Shah - for freedom from an oppressive government, a government in which she knew that the difference between the social classes caused many people pain, but then she also shows throughout the rest of the book how the Iranian people were manipulated into becoming faithful to an Islamic regime. The serious re-structuring of schools caused great suffering and contributed to the difficulty with changing mindsets. If the religious government controls the schools, then the children are inculcated with the religious ideas, much like how Marjane was initially inculcated with the thought that the Shah was chosen by God. In addition, the Islamic regime ultimately secured their power by uniting the Iranian people in war against a foreign enemy and carrying on the war until the society was so completely devastated, they would not have the energy or desire to cause further revolt of any kind. I think this is an important topic for the Western world to see, as Western relations with Iran affect us in many ways. Our government currently has strict economic sanctions on Iran, which causes our gas prices to go up and impacts us where we feel it the most, our wallets; however, most people do not see the reason behind this, and why the world needs to take note of the tyranny in Iran. In addition, many people here in the United States lump together all of the people in the Middle East under the label of \"Arabs\" and then furthermore, see them all as extreme Muslims and terrorists, particularly since 9/11. As a student pointed out in class today, the book was published shortly after 9/11, which is likely not a coincidence. In the days after this event, many Americans viewed any Middle Eastern man with a beard or any Middle Eastern woman with a hijab as a terrorist, a threat; yet Marjane paints us a much needed picture of a world so many Americans do not realize exists - a world in which many free spirited Iranian people endure a forced dress code that represents far more oppression than we here in America could ever imagine.",

                "reviewText": "The Book Persepolis, By Marjie Satrapi, caught my eye right away. Uneducated about the Islamic revolution in 1980, I saw this book and knew I had to read it. Once the book arrived, I was immediately surprised by the book and the fact that it was a graphic novel. However, this really excited me because I had always loved reading graphic novels when I was younger. The book had one of the freshest perspectives on writing that I had read in a while. This has been one of the most interesting Memoirs I have ever read. The Memoir is so powerful because of its ability to telling stories through not just words but also pictures, and how it was able to express certain emotions, in ways ordinary books could not. For example, Satrapi uses the Graphic novel sense of the book to express the emotion that you could not see or empathize with through just reading text. Whether Satrapi decides to express happiness or sadness, Through the novel, she expresses the way she felt personally and also gives you a visual, to help put yourself into her shoes. She also gives the reader new insight into the Islamic Revolution and people who lived in Iran. Many people are quick to judge people, and that comes especially true when talking about people during the Islamic Revolution. She makes the reader understand that the people who had to first-hand witness the Islamic Revolution, are no different than ordinary people, just like the reader and even helps you sympathize with the character. Satrapi does a great job at incorporating western fashion, to help show the reader visually that people from who lived in Iran during the Islamic Revolution are just like any ordinary person. This book blew me away, and I look forward to reading the second part of Satrapi\u2019s Persepolis.",

But to my surprise, it was very good and helpful to understand from an outsiders view the events leading from before the suppression of the people,especially women, to present times. I\u2019m am glad I read it and I can recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "So many countries have had their share of war \u2013 both, internal and external war. Iran has certainly had their share of emporers, kings, and political oppression. In the introduction of this book, Satrapi gives us a brief two-page synopsis of Iran, its beginnings, its wars, and what happened in 1979 when the last Shah of Iran fled the Islamic revolution. And this is where the author begins her story.Satrapi was six when the revolution began. Her coming of age story begins when she was aged ten. She was an intelligent child from an upper-middle class family who wanted to understand why her world as she knew it, was turned upside by revolution. Satrapi shares with us about all the changes that took place in her country during the revolution, and the year it became mandatory to \u2018wear the veil\u2019. She hated it. She could no longer go to school with a mix of boys and girls either. Her privileged and modern life as she knew it, was no longer.Marjane was an only child, and a deeply spiritual girl. In her very young life, she thought she wanted to grow up to be a prophet, but as her world was changing, this would no longer be possible. At a very young age, she began reading books on empires and autocratic world leaders. She wanted to understand why the demonstrations in her country were so violent, horrible crimes against humanity. Marjane repeatedly asked her parents if she could join them in the daily protests they attended on the street from morning till night, but they wouldn\u2019t allow her to participate. She was tired of protesting alone in her own backyard. But her father told her they could get shot at a demonstration, and refused to bring her along. But Marjane believed that if a revolution was to succeed, the entire population should support it. The revolution was a fight against social classes.Politics overwhelmed Marja. She was tired of the people in her life \u2018disappearing\u2019, and she was tired of same answers from her parents \u2013 \u2018they went on a trip\u2019. When her Uncle Anoosh reappeared after fleeing political persecution, he told Marja, \u201cIn a country where half the population is illiterate, you cannot unite the people around Marx, the only thing that can really unite them is Nationalism or a religious ethic . . . but the religious leaders didn\u2019t know how to govern,\u201d he called it a fake election takeover \u2013 many fled Iran while others thought it wouldn\u2019t last. Uncle Anoosh was found and executed. And Marja became angry with God.The bombings began and the fundamentalists took down the U.S. Embassy \u2013 no longer viable to get a visa to flee. The universities closed for two years in order to rewrite new religious curriculum. The middle and upper class feared they\u2019d be forced to wear the veil and perhaps \u2018no more cars, back to camels\u2019. Marja found her young world crashing as she feared she wouldn\u2019t get to go to university and become a scholar.Marja\u2019s parents protested daily, and her mother was threatened for refusing to wear the veil or acknowledging the new fundamentalist government \u2013 she ultimately succumbed. It was declared that \u2018to protect women from all potential rapists\u2019, they declared wearing the veil was mandatory. There became two types of women and two types of men \u2013 the fundamentalists and the modern man/woman. Apparently, the modern woman no longer had a choice but to wear the veil, but in protest, they allowed some of their hair to stick out. To distinguish the two types of men \u2013 fundamentalists didn\u2019t shave and grew long beards, and didn\u2019tuck their shirts in, vs. the clean shaven men (mustaches optional) who tucked in their shirts and wore neck ties \u2013 a fashion from \u2018the west\u2019, frowned upon. New Islamic religion stated that women\u2019s hair \u2019emanates rays that excite men\u2019. It sure feels to me that women had to tone down their looks so as not to excite men. So sad. It doesn\u2019t surprise me how many Iranians fled the revolution.Marja tells us that not just the government changed, but many of the people she knew. Marja was told by her parents that if anyone asks, she prays five times a day. Her mother was a staunch fighter for women\u2019s rights.One year after the protests began, Marja\u2019s parents brought her to one, and Marja shares the violence she witnessed that one and only day she went to protest. And when they began beating women with bats because they weren\u2019t wearing the veil, Marja and her parents scurried home.In September 1980, Marja\u2019s parents took her on a three-week vacation to Europe, they came back to another war, with Iraq \u2013 that was on top of the already civil war going on in Iran. When the Iraqis began dropping bombs in Tehran, Marja writes, \u201cThe Arabs never liked the Persians . . . they attacked us 1400 years ago, they forced their religion on us.\u201d Her father concurred, but added that the real invasion had already come from their own government. Everything was changing daily as war was both internal and external in Iran. Their Iranian National Anthem was replaced by the new government\u2019s hymn. Marja\u2019s father had given up on listening to news in Iran that he knew was lies. He\u2019d tune in nightly to his old radio and listen to the BBC.Once border town oil refineries were bombed, village people fled to the main city of Tehran, food shortages began in supermarkets, and gas was limited.Marja had to get used to new school protocols, like beating her chest to war cries on the loudspeaker, and celebrating Revolution Day. Her parents along with many others rebelled the teachers. There were strict rules about wearing the veil with NO hair showing \u2013 to that statement, and some comic relief, Marja\u2019s dad responded to that teacher, \u201cIf hair is as stimulating as you say, then you need to shave your mustache.\u201dThe young boys were handed out golden keys in school, and told if they went to war and died, the key would get them into heaven and they\u2019d be offered a better life in paradise. As young as fourteen years old, they were lured to war.Soon enough, the family had to keep dark drapes drawn, and had to bomb-proof their house. The enemy was anywhere and everywhere among their own as citizens were swayed to the fundamentalist\u2019s side, devoted to the new regime. There were strict rules: no parties, no card games, no gambling, no alcohol, and of course, the dress code. And one never knew if their neighbor had flipped and become an extremist who would happily rat out anyone disobeying. Marja tells us about one night in particular when her family was out at a newborn baby celebration, with alcohol, and they were stopped on the way home by extremist police spot-check. They smelled the alcohol on her father\u2019s breath and saw he wore a necktie. He was told to get back in the car and they would follow him home to search his house for alcohol, but that one time they were lucky that money still talked and Marja\u2019s dad bought them off. The persecutions got worse in Iran as the wars progressed. Besides wearing the veil in school, no nail polish or jewelry was permitted either. But food was becoming more available from the black markets \u2013 if you had the money.Marja shares another scary story with us. She tells about the day she went out wearing her new American Nike shoes and a Michael Jackson badge she wore on her jacket. These were items no longer available in Iran, but her parents had taken a short trip to Turkey and bought some items for her that Iran saw as Western apparel. There was now a new extreme women\u2019s branch called, The Guardians of the Revolution. Marja was stopped on the street by some of those women, they told her \u2018decadence is forbidden\u2019. Marja considered that her lucky day when she was let off with a warning instead of being taken to headquarters where \u2018people have been known to disappear for days\u2019.At fourteen years old, Marja was wise beyond her years and a self-proclaimed rebel. If she chose to wear jewelry, the teachers would take it off her, never to be returned. And one day, Marja lost her constraint \u2013 the day the principal tried to take her bracelet from her, Marja whacked her so hard, she fell. Marja was expelled. Through connections, her parents got her into another school. But that didn\u2019t last long before Marja called out the teacher for her lies. At that point, Marja\u2019s parents arranged to have her sent to school in Austria, where they had relatives. They were petrified that their daughter\u2019s brevity would land her in jail or killed. Her parents told Marja they would follow in a few months. But would they?With breaking hearts, her parents took Marja to the airport so that she could live in freedom and get the education she deserved, and to allow her to be the child she needed to be.I shall look forward to reading the second book, Persepolis 2, where Marjane returns to Iran as a young adult after fleeing the oppression.",
