            "Editorial Reviews Review Why did urban, vegetarian, gun-wary Navied, of Iranian descent, have the big, bright idea to move with his wife to the frigid mountains of Idaho, months before Trump\u2019s election? Riveting, searching, complex and, oh, hilarious, this memoir ultimately is a quest for strength, wildness, and love, for a deeper vision of all things Earth. Surely this is my favorite graphic memoir I\u2019ve read in years.\u2015Deb Olin Unferth, author (Revolution: The Year I Fell in Love and Went to Join the War) \"Enamored of nature and dazzled by fantasies of the rugged west, a young mixed-race couple build a tiny home in the wilds of Idaho\u2015and must confront an America at odds with itself. In This Country, Mahdavian explores today\u2019s cultural divide with a keen eye and a graceful touch. The resulting portrait is by turns hilarious and heartbreaking, elegant and complex, brutal and tender. I dare you not to fall in love.\" \u2015Alia Volz, author (Home Baked: Marijuana, My Mother and the Stoning of San Francisco) This Country is a hilarious and sometimes harrowing graphic memoir about the Mahdavians' quest to live self-sufficiently in rural Idaho. Learning how to cut down a tree to heat your own house and grow your own vegetables is only one part of it....Wonderful drawings and beautiful writing make this book a great read. \u2015Roz Chast, author and cartoonist (Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?) \u201cI knew Navied Mahdavian was one of the funniest cartoonists of his generation; This Country proves he is also one of its most subtle and sophisticated graphic storytellers. In Navied's hands, comics feel like poetry. Perfect ink drawings bring land, beast, and human, with all their delicacy and yearning, viscerally to life. This Country, a quintessential story of seeking a home in America and (maybe) finding it, and made me want to grant my own surroundings the grace, humor, and dignity of Navied's observant study.\u201d \u2015Amy Kurzweil, cartoonist and author (Flying Couch: A Graphic Memoir) A charming, wise, and haunting book. [I've known] that town quite well for the last thirty years, [and Mahdavian has] captured it in all its complexity.\" \u2015Christopher Guest, actor, screenwriter, and director (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, This is Spinal Tap) \u201cThis Country is touching, personal, and frequently hilarious. Mahdavian weaves heavy themes of home and belonging with disarming moments of silliness and levity. It\u2019s a story specific to his experience, yet relatable to anyone who has ever searched for a place to be.\u201d \u2015Reza Farazmand, writer and illustrator of Poorly Drawn Lines \u201cOstensibly, This Country is about a couple finding their place in the world and learning the true history of the land they're building a life on\u2015a land that has seen both turmoil and awe\u2015but amid the harsh truth, blatant racism, and struggles to fit in, there is so much beauty and humor and compassion. Mahdavian's drawings are deceptively simple, perfectly capturing the wonder of little everyday occurrences. Of time moving, a small family growing and changing, of an entire country still reckoning with past and present mistakes. This is a very important book for pretty much everyone.\u201d \u2015Julia Wertz, cartoonist and author of Impossible People About the Author Navied Mahdavian has been a contributing cartoonist at the New Yorker since 2018. His work has also been published in Reader's Digest, Wired, and Alta Online and the books The Rejection Collection and Send Help! Before becoming a cartoonist, he taught the fifth grade, where he learned most of his jokes. Mahdavian was born in Miami and lives in Salt Lake City, Utah."

        "description": "\u201cWith light and airy illustrations, Mahdavian tackles these complex themes with humor and wit.\u201d \u2014NPR, Books We Love 2023NPR BEST BOOKS OF 2023 \u25cf NEW YORKER BEST BOOKS WE\u2019VE READ IN 2023\u25cf A gorgeously illustrated and written debut graphic memoir about belonging, identity, and making a home in the remote American West, by New Yorker cartoonist Navied Mahdavian.Before Navied Mahdavian moved with his wife and dog in November of 2016 from San Francisco to an off-the-grid cabin in rural Idaho, he had never fished, gardened, hiked, hunted, or lived in a snowy place. But there, he could own land, realize his dream of being an artist, and start a family. Over the next three years, Mahdavian leaned into the wonders of the natural Idaho landscape and found himself adjusting to and enjoying a slower pace of living. But beyond the boundaries of his six acres, he was confronted with the realities of America\u2019s political shifts and forced to confront the question: Do I belong here? Mahdavian\u2019s beautifully written and unflinchingly honest graphic memoir charts his growth and struggles as an artist, citizen, and new father. It celebrates his love of place and honors the relationships he makes in rural America, touching on dynamics like culture, environment, and identity in America, and even articulating difficult moments of racism and brutality he found there as a Middle Eastern American. With wit, compassion, and a sense of humor, Mahdavian\u2019s insider perspective offers a unique portrait of one of the most remote and wild areas of the American West.",

Navied drew me into his journey with captivating storytelling, illuminating tidbits of information that kept me wondering how he knew so many lesser-known facts, and drawings that told stories on their own without the need of a caption. His memoir was an enjoyable read that at times made me laugh, at times made me cry, and at times made me marvel at humanity. I couldn\u2019t put the book down and wished it was longer once I finished it.",

And this leads to the decision that they couple ultimately make at the end of the book for the sake of their child born in the wilderness.",
