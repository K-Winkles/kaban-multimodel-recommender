                "reviewText": "This should really be considered THE standard reference for the Analects in English. Slingerland's linguistic choices, in terms of which word to use for a specific Chinese character, are impeccable.Downsides: It doesn't adhere to a single traditional Chinese interpretation, notably the Zhu Xi interpretation that has been dominant for over 600 years. Although it features commentary, which is excellently translated, the selections appear to be subjectively chosen without a consistent standard. Furthermore, the phraseology of the translations leans more toward a verbose Western style and narrow logic, as opposed to the \"concise yet open\" gu-wen \u53e4\u6587 style in which the Analects is written.That said, as a comprehensive \"reference standard,\" there's really no other work that compares.",

This edition is especially helpful for outsiders like me.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, don't get any other copy of the Analects. Due to the nature of the Analects, which are composed of short passages and proverbs, a straight reading of them in English can leave one underwhelmed. The Analects are brought to life when one acquires the historical and philosophical context that sheds light on its passages. In other words, the Analects only actually make sense (the way they're supposed to) with the commentaries. As far as I know, this is the only English translation in print with some of these commentaries. Reading the Analects with the commentaries totally changed my understanding of Confucianism.",

                "reviewText": "Slingerland's translation of the Analects is not bad. However, I am only giving it three stars. This is because there are some points where the author purposefully diverges from what he knows to be the normal understanding of a sentence. For example, verse 3.23 inverts the meaning of the sentence, making Confucius an Aristotelian. In verse 9.1 the remarkable statement that \"Confucius rarely spoke about goodness\", known to all Chinese, is turned on its head through a revisionist reading of a character. The latter translation is explained at length in commentary, so that the reader is aware what is going on, but the former is not.Before you buy, go to a large public library and try comparing this to an edition by Burton Watson or Arthur Waley.",

The commentary was pitched perfectly, giving me the context I needed without overwhelming the text. I came away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Confucius. This is the version I will be going back to again and again.",
