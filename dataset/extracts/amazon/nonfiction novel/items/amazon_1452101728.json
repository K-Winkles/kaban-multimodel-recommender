But this book is amazing. Yes I\u2019ve done a lot of this stuff on my own. Do you absolutely need it? Of course not. Will this make your novel waaaaaay easier to write? Absolutely! I am motivated, I\u2019m doing the exercises in it I was convinced I didn\u2019t need to do. AND IT IS HELPING! This is deepening the complexity of my novel for me. Giving it a richness I didn't know it lacked. I\u2019ll get back with you in a month to tell you if I ever finished it (yes i have ten million blank journals so I\u2019m slightly scared I\u2019ll fizzle out but honestly don\u2019t think I will) and my novel. I\u2019m the writer with fourteen WIPs and I will literally be buying this book for every single one of them. But I really am happy with this purchase and if you are a writer or you know a writer this is honestly a game changer. 11/10 So worth it.",

I have two of these now, one for each of the books I am writing. It keeps my ideas clear and concise, offers me a deeper look into my characters, setting and plot that I wouldn't normally be able to delve into myself, and the best of all, it keeps me from making stupid mistakes such as changing something later in the book because I didn't have it written down. I often go back into the book to do exercises I have saved for later if I get stuck in writer's block and it helps me get past those hard times. I will continue to buy this workbook over and over again for each and every novel that I plan on publishing, and will continue to recommend it to people. It is great for those who are taking their time developing ideas or working on a long project, and also great for people who are doing events such as Camp Nano and NaNoWriMo. I cannot say enough bout this book. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "Love the organization, the topics, the brief info before each section about attaining your writing goals. Be aware the majority of this book is for you the user to fill out with details about your character and plot. You'll get a one or two paragraph prompt and explanation, then it's up to you to do the hard work. I love it.However... This is a workbook, most of the pages have a place to write info specific to your novel. It's bound like a regular paperback you would just read. It's hard to keep it open, write, and drink your coffee/tea/ale at the same time.I assume the publisher was afraid people would copy a spiral-bound or other lay-flat binding book and reuse it instead of buying another copy for the next novel. Probably true. But those people are going to jam this flat like an abused textbook and scan/copy the pages anyway. Please put this very useful book out in a format we writers who are fueled by beverage and/or pastry consumption can manage without the book slithering to the floor and drawing unwanted attention to the prospective bestseller.Exercises in the book call for Post-It notes. I would suggest until the binding is changed, buy a gross of Post-It notes and use those to write on, then slap them into the correct page.Not only will you save your tea from mishaps and your person from embarrassment as your dropped book echoes around the concrete-floored coffee shop, you'll be able to write on a more stable surface and (whispers) re-use this fine book for your next bestseller.",

It is definitely geared towards NaNo project writing, but it works with any time of year. If you are doing NaNo, this journal would easily give you the 50k words that you need, and i feel like you'd be hard pressed to have a writer's block using this as a guide. But like I said, it's a great tool for any kind of novel writing. The only thing I'd change is being able to have a downloadable version for future use. I don't want to have to buy a new journal every time I start a new project, and other journals I've had that are like this have come with downloadable versions for verified purchases of the hard copy. Not a big deal and not enough to knock off a star for the review or anything, but perhaps a suggestion for the future.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, coming from a thirteen year old girl who has been writing novels since the young age of seven or eight, this book is absolutely wonderful. I don't know who will disregard my opinion on it, as I am so young, but this novel workshop is very handy and a very good method for planning out books. I no longer have to plot out novels on pieces of printer paper, losing them every few days or so. Instead, I am actually able to plan out a novel on these books instead. It's really handy... as I am not really the average \"happily ever after\" writer. The several different ways you can take this book are incredible. Instead of me always having to fill in the \"What happens to the characters after they are happy in the end?\" box, I am able to express my opinion better. This book is great.",

                "reviewText": "I love reading. LOVE IT. I've always wanted to write my very own novel, but had NO IDEA how to start. Ready, Set, Novel!: A Workbook is a terrific tool. To my very great surprise and delight, the instructional areas are not bland or boring, but rather funny and witty. The exercises in it really help expand my mind, even if they make me think so hard that I get a headache from time to time. The workbook also has hysterical pick-me-ups and ... drum roll please ... every writers favorite thing - procrastination pages! More importantly, this workbook will help you flesh out your characters and give them depth, and I mean DEPTH. And while there are many blank spots/pages for you to write in, I'd still pick up a blank notebook somewhere to keep alongside this one, because with this book, and all the fresh and exciting ideas that will flood your mind, you may just need it.",

                "reviewText": "I am currently using this workbook to plan my second series of novels. The range of activities are excellent for getting the creative juices flowing, and the light-hearted approach is both inspirational and amusing. Also, there is a high level of flexibility as to which sections you decide are helpful; if you feel one part is a waste of your time, the book makes it very clear it's ok to move on. For example, I have been writing for decades and find the chapters relating to stylistic growth unhelpful, whereas the remainder of the book is superb for organising my thoughts and developing characters, settings, plot etc.For anyone who is unsure about how to begin writing or feeling overwhelmed by the prospect, I highly recommend picking one of these up. In fact, I have just ordered two more copies, which I will later utilise for the second and third entries in my new trilogy. An easy five stars.",
