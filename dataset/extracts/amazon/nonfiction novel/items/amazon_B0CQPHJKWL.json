Can you imagine that one day, when you think nothing new and significant will happen in your life and you can only settle for the mundane, someone appears and has a solution? Well, it's nothing like the magic wand - you must wake up first and do something about it. But that first nudge is always the most important one. Michael does that for Sheera.Sheera is a single mother. She keeps telling herself that she doesn't need a father for her child. She can make it. At the same time, she wants a stable relationship and a job without stress. She works at a TV station and her son loves hearing about what new shows are coming on TV.Sheera thinks she has it all, but she just isn't happy. That is the perfect time for Michael to appear in her life.I'm not a great fan of characters writing letters to each other (emails in this case). I don't like novels consisting of letters/emails. But Sheera has a gentle touch when she writes her part, and I like how Michael is confident. You will notice two different styles throughout those emails, no worries. I liked the one when Michael was describing what he was doing in the army.",
