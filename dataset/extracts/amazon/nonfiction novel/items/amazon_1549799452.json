For the most part the author of this collection of lectures looks at religion from a personal point of view, not socially or politically. The author's various description of religion are quite strong, in my opinion, though he is a little lacking when he comes to summing up his own take on things in the final couple of lectures.",

I purchased this edition from CrossReach Publications. While I'd agree with some other reviewers that the formatting is a bit odd, I actually appreciate the dimensions of the book more than I would had it been printed with more pages, less columns, and a smaller footprint.The book itself is really impressive. Anyone interested in Religion, American Philosophy, or the richness of individual human experience should do themselves a favor and check it out.",

This might not be the best book to start with from this great thinker, but it is an interesting take on spirituality and how to understand its origins and purpose.Seeing as James wrote more than 100 years ago there are many things we know now that he did not then. In his time, neuroscience was in its infancy many decades away from the sophisticated development of fMRI scanners. His attempt to understand why humans would have a sense of spirituality leaves open the possibility of some legitimate spiritual force that affects some of us but not all. Modern methods are revealing the evolutionary underpinnings of the need for spirituality which leads to James ultimate conclusion seeming quaint the late 2010's.But, understanding the history of human thinking on psychology, or any field for that matter, is imperative if one wishes to claim an understanding of a topic.",

                "reviewText": "This is quite an extraordinary read. The mere fact that these are the transcripts of various lectures just shows there once was a time where one idea could be detailed to an extent so great, that it made the subject even more great. James does that here. This collection is not about religion in the traditional western sense, but the phenomenological one, where how the order of things seems to be the chips falling into place of felt experience. The components of this work are so unbelievably detailed, challenging, and emotional, just as religion in the acutest and primordial sense was and should always be. Excellent printing as well!",
