                "reviewText": "I was recently offered a role in a local community theater production of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth.\u201d The play\u2019s director encouraged all actors to gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare\u2019s words, to better perform each part. He suggested a book entitled \u201cSparkNotes No Fear Shakespeare \u2013 Macbeth\u201d as a guide.I purchased a paperback copy of \u201cNo Fear Shakespeare \u2013 Macbeth,\u201d and I am very pleased with it. This wonderful little book is set up with Shakespeare\u2019s original words on each left-hand page; on each right-hand page is a modern English paraphrase of the original script. While I was memorizing my lines from the left-hand pages, I quickly discovered I could learn my character\u2019s deeper motivations for what he was saying by referring to the modern English paraphrase. As a result, I learned my lines more quickly, and am more effectively portraying my character during rehearsals.\u201cNo Fear Shakespeare \u2013 Macbeth\u201d also includes a full list of main characters with their descriptions, as well as occasional footnotes that help clarify the meaning of some words, phrases, and situations.I\u2019ve always loved reading the works of William Shakespeare for simple enjoyment, and I found that \u201cNo Fear Shakespeare \u2013 Macbeth\u201d not only helped me greatly in preparing for our upcoming performances of our local production of \u201cMacbeth;\u201d it also gave me tremendous enjoyment in reading the play itself. I plan on buying many more volumes in the \u201cNo Fear Shakespeare\u201d series. Highly recommended.",
