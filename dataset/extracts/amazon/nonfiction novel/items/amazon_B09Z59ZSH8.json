We look forward to reading book 2.",

I feel the same way. The author has a way of drawing you into the story and making you want to read more. Now I definitely have to read the next book in the series.",

                "reviewText": "I almost never read western novels, and those I do occasionally read are generally Louis L'amour or Zane Grey, but the description of this book intrigued me, so I bought it and am glad that I did.The story is simple enough. A man is beaten, shot and killed by outlaws, but somehow a lightning strike brings him back to life and, after being nursed back to health, he sets out for revenge (or justice if you will) from those who killed him. Along the way he finds love with a frontier family but continues to be haunted by not knowing who he is or what is past was.The story is simple enough, the characters interesting, although not fully fleshed out, and there is no gray here. The good guys are good, the bad guys are very bad and the action is simple and straight forward. While this might sound like the book is boring it is anything but, and I finished it in a little over a day. In fact I found it so interesting that I abandoned the other book I was reading to finish this one first, and expect to buy the next book in the series. The writing is clear, things are resolved quickly and, surprisingly, I found the story hard to put down.For someone who generally does not read western novels I thought the book was a great change of pace.",

                "reviewText": "Hey there book lovers! It is your old pal, Ninetoes, coming at you with a review of John Deacon\u2019s A Man Called Justice. I have my thinking cap on, and coffee in my system so let\u2019s do this!I have always been of the frame of mind that 99.9% of your Westerns fall into two categories: John Wayne where there is some violence and minimal bloodshed and the line between good and evil is as sharp as a razor, and Clint Eastwood where the violence abounds, bullets fly and the line between good and evil is hazy.John Deacon\u2019s A Man Called Justice falls into the John Wayne camp. It starts with a woman and her son at a river and they see four men dragging a man behind them on horseback. The man is strung up on a tree like Christ on the cross, and he is left for dead. Before the men leave, one pins a badge on the man\u2019s chest. After they leave, the woman cuts the man down and she prays for him. A freak bolt of lightning lashes out and hits the badge, bringing the man back to life. She takes him back to her home and nurses him back to health. He has no recollection of his past, none at all. He sees the word \u201cJustice\u201d on his badge and that\u2019s what he takes as his name. Now Justice has a mission. Get the men who killed him, find the missing pieces of his past, and protect the woman and her son.This book is tagged as a \u201cWestern with heart\u201d, and it does have that. The writing is sharp, and the pace is as fast as a bullet. Some of the action is over too fast, and some points get repetitive, but I understand why the repetition is there. This has all the hallmarks of a good Western: A noble hero, a strong female, a ruthless land baron, and evil men who do not care about the pain they inflict. Oh yeah, and an incredible sense of justice and revenge. The shootouts are necessary and not just there for the sake of being there or adding to a word count. There are three more books in the series and I plan to get the rest!I give this one 4.5 bookmarks out of 5!",

The character development provided insight into the people involved. I didn't mind the romantic element but it was mentioned time and time again, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. It was just too much that just seemed to be added to pad the number of words/pages. In spite of that, I would recommend it for some light reading.",

Gonna buy the next 3 books to the set. If you like westerns then look no further, John Deacons the man to watch",
