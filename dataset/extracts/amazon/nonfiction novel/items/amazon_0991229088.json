                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Three Threads, One Story Well And Intricately Woven",
                "reviewText": "This book follows the separate stories of Mitsuo Fuchida who led the attack on Pearl Harbor, a Doolittle Raider, and the daughter of missionaries caught up in the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. For those interested in World War II (as I am), the story begins very appropriately with the lead-up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. It then follows Fuchida (certainly the main person of interest for most readers) during the historical attack, and then through Midway, the end of the war, the surrender of Japan, and his search for meaning in the wake of those dramatic events. While overall this book definitely rates 5 stars, there were a couple things that could have made it more enjoyable. The hopscotching between the three storylines (one of which splits in two, adding a fourth thread to keep track of) is a little too frequent, with some of the \u201chops\u201d occasionally comprising only a terse few sentences. This made the story feel a little fragmented rather than cohesive at times. Also, the three story threads are not brought together until very late in the book, though I will say that when this finally occurs it is done so adeptly that it satisfactorily offset my complaint here. The bottom line is that this is great read for anyone interested in Mitsuo Fuchida\u2019s journey, both historical and religious. Well recommended!",

He was in the lounge by the bar with a large party waiting to be seated. I was goimg back and forth to the bar, getting drinks for my customers, and kept hearing them calling him \u201cMits\u201d or \u201cReverend Fuchida\u201d. I\u2019d read \u201cDay of Infamy\u201d by Walter Lord at Punahou in 8th Grade, and thought \u201cMits\u2026 Mits Fuchida\u2026\u201d On my third or fourth trip to the bar, curiosity overcame silence, and I told his interpreter \u201cExcuse me Sir, but I couldn\u2019t help overhearing your group refer to this Gentleman as Mits or Rverend Fuchida. If I\u2019m not mistaken, Commander Mitsuo Fuchida led the attack on Pearl Harbor\u2014\u201c At that point, Revered Fuchida, who understood English better than he could speak it, looked up in my eyes, and with a sad smile said in heavily accented English\u201cZattu wasu me.\u201d I was holding a tray wiith drinks.Reverend Fuchida brought his hand up toward me as if he was offering to shake it, but noting that my hands were full, quickly withdrew it as we both shrugged slightly and chuckled at the inability to shake hands. For a fleeting moment I imagined dumping my drinks on him, but quelled the thought as his interpreter told me he had given his life over to the Gospel of Christ, and was now an Evangelical Minister, here in Portland for a Crusade. I still consider that moment as one of the most remarkable in my life so far. And reading \u201cWounded Tiger\u201d has certainly reaffirmed the Miracle of God\u2019s Lovein my own Heart, Mind, Body, Soul and Spirit.Bill SageHonolulu1.17.2024",

In the past I had to read books of this type with a stack of reference books beside me showing pictures of ships, planes, maps, etc. Or pictures would be clumped together in only 2 or 3 places in the book; very unhandy & distracting. Also appreciated is the fact that this author has the skill to write a real \u201cpage turner\u201d without the use of profanity!

This book reveals a good deal about the more obscure details. That said, I had spent August, 1957 in Tokyo with my field grade officer father who was on leave. Our family also traveled to an incredibly beautiful resort on a lake at the foot of Mt. Fuji. We were humbled by all our interactions with people in Japan. We know the history but have found difficulty with understanding the Japanese motives. This clears up some questions.",
