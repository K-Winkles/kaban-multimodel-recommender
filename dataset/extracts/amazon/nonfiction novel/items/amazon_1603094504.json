The story is about the experiences in the Japanese internment camps and the background of its history. My father was PWO in the Soviets during World War II, but he survived. During his life, he seldom talked about his experiences, and I often thought he had alcoholism. I didn't know. Mr. Takei's experience recalled my father's, and I felt incredibly guilty about my lack of understanding of the pain that my father had carried for the rest of his life. You may genuinely try to comprehend how the people in the period might have felt, but acknowledging the background of history is paramount and almost a duty to those who passed away.By the way, the book's condition was as the seller described. I was delighted to find some people who are still honest and trustworthy. There is still hope in America. Thank you very much!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Open Your Eyes!",
                "reviewText": "In 1942, over 120,000 Japanese-Americans were taken away from their homes and placed into dingy prison camps all over the US. They did nothing wrong, but had none of the legal means to prove it to the racist authorities. They were paying for the sins of their home country after the Pearl Harbor bombing. Classic ignorant thinking at its worst: because a small minority of the group committed the crime, the entire group is guilty. George Takei spent most of his tender childhood living under this kind of oppression as he and his family were among the Japanese-American families locked up in internment camps. Reading about this shameful experience through his eyes makes everything that much more heartbreaking. His young mind couldn\u2019t comprehend the ignorance of those in charge. He tried to make sense of the barbed wire enclosures, deplorable conditions, and abusive army guards. Fast forward into adulthood and George Takei does everything in his power as an equal rights activist and Hollywood actor to make sure this terrifying history doesn\u2019t happen again.This graphic novel is nothing short of a brutally honest look into the politics of fear. Powerful politicians will use their influence and charisma to rile up their supporters into believing that the less fortunate are what\u2019s wrong with this country. We saw it with the Japanese internment in George Takei\u2019s book and we\u2019re seeing it today with the Muslim ban, the family separation policy at the Mexican border, and black people getting harsher treatment from law enforcement than whites. The one thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. This book has the power to educate its readers. When you familiarize yourself with your fellow world citizens, you\u2019re less likely to judge them. That\u2019s what \u201cThey Called Us Enemy\u201d means to me and that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s getting a perfect five out of five stars. The more educated we are, the better off we\u2019ll be. That means leaving behind comfortable bigotry and thinking about what it\u2019s like to be the other guy, which is often a horrifying reality.But of course, there will always be those contrarians out there who say, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all that bad!\u201d These same people say it about black slavery, they call Mexican border detention centers \u201cSummer Camp\u201d, and they\u2019ll no doubt say it about Japanese internment camps. Having guaranteed living conditions doesn\u2019t mean those conditions are necessarily good. Did I mention the barbed wire fencing around the camps? Did I mention the abusive treatment from the soldiers? What about the fact that George Takei\u2019s family had to live in a horse stall that smelled like rancid feces? What about the infighting among Japanese prisoners who joined the military to prove their patriotism and the prisoners who stayed in the camps to protest? Had enough harsh reality? But wait, there\u2019s one more juicy detail: institutionalization. Some prisoners were so familiar with the routine life of the camps that they couldn\u2019t imagine getting back on their feet in a normal society. Now imagine a child as young as George Takei feeling that way upon leaving the camp. You get to see all of this through the author\u2019s eyes whether you want to or not. It won\u2019t be pleasant, but it\u2019ll be a necessary kick in the butt for the apathetic and fearful.Despite the shortness and quick pacing of the book, you will feel as though you\u2019ve taken an entire US history course in one sitting. Let this be a message to you all. Treat your neighbors with kindness and respect. Treat your inferiors with the same level of understanding and love. If you see an injustice happening, don\u2019t stay quiet. Be the activist you were meant to become. Be a passionate enough voice in this battle for equality that those in power will have no choice but to listen. Let your words haunt them like schizophrenic ghosts. Will this change anything? Let me put it this way: we don\u2019t have a choice but to activate our activism. The world can\u2019t survive without making progressive leaps and bounds. That is the nature of time. Any questions?",

                "reviewText": "The black and white art and the style of the illustrations may initially seem simplistic or even childish, but they actually are reflecting the era (1940's) and an interweaving of Japanese and American illustration style (with some contemporary touches).The fact that there were Japanese internment camps may be something you know, but this book will give you a more emotional view of this embarrassing passage in recent American history.George Takei takes us through his personal experience of the camps, from when he first arrives as a young boy, and then the reader experiences the growing awareness young George experiences, as he matures over time in the camps.As a teen, we watch as he grows angry with his father for not standing up better against the mistreatment, but the book continues and shows us how as a grownup he comes to appreciate better what his father did, with limited options.This is not an autobiography in the regular sense, because even though George Takei is the main character, and it is written from his point of view, the center of the story considers what it means to real people when Democracy gives way to fear, as it did with the American Japanese during WWII.The book does touch on other aspects of the author's life, mentions Star Trek, and a few other things, but these are only included as they reflect ways American culture recovered from that dark period.If you are looking for a fully fleshed out autobiography of George Takei, or if you are looking for a nonfiction book about the Japanese internment in the U.S., you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a good, fast read, centered around a human being you already know something about, as a way to learn about the experiences of the internment, and the emotional situation both from the people in the camps and the emotions leading to what happened to Japanese Americans at that time, this book is for you.4 stars instead of 5 because there were a few passages that were hard to follow. I realize the book was carefully edited to be as succinct and direct as possible, but sometime I would have appreciated a few more frames to clarify the scene.This book is easily read by teens and adults. Probably appropriate for middle school students, though they may need someone to help them understand some of the political background (the book leaves a lot to the reader to know). Younger readers won't struggle with the vocabulary if they are old enough to read chapter books. But they won't understand the events, and they won't understand the importance of how George changes as he ages.Some adults may be inclined to not pay attention to the illustrations. Don't skip them, they're not superfluous. They help with the setting in a way that the sparse text intentionally leaves to the art in both style and content.\"They Called Us Enemy\" is a worthwhile read for the story, the history, and the example of the son coming to terms with his father with love, tenderness, and respect.",

                "reviewTitle": "Going Boldly",
                "reviewText": "George Takei is many things: as an actor he is most readily associated with being Mr Sulu on \u2018Star Trek\u2019 but his pan-Asian helmsman from the USS Enterprise is only a fraction of the story. A social rights campaigner for much of his adult life, Mr Sulu was an early sign of success for a young Takei, being a positive Asian character on American TV at a time when Japanese-Americans (and, pretty much anyone of non-Caucasian heritage) were not usually treated at all kindly by the \u2018white majority\u2019.The role gave Takei recognition and the springboard to further LGBT+ rights as well as the opportunity to address injustices around the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII.While, as a UK reader of \u2018They Called Us Enemy\u2019, certain nuisances of the US constitution left me a little cold, the human story behind the treatment of a whole swathe of people - purely due to their racial heritage - is powerfully told and, as the book itself points out, the resonances in recent American history - given the actions of Trump - remain deeply concerning.Takei\u2019s an inspiring individual who draws greatly on the inspiration of his own parents and, in particular, his father. This book is also an inspiration, illuminating an aspect of American history about which I had little awareness. It is also about more than one moment in history and how one set of people were treated during it, it makes it clear that this one episode is part of a wider continuum about the choices individuals and states make in treating people and their communities with respect and fairness. It also serves as a warning that advances in civil rights are rarely uniform and enduring: they ebb and flow. Gains, once made, cannot be assumed to be forever - far from it - and states can take decades rectifying wrongs. Rights need fighting for day-by-day so that they are maintained, something Takei does not flinch from, whether here or in his daily life and, for that, I commend him, his work and this book.",

He read it in a few days and insisted I put my own book down and read it right after he finished. I found it a surprising mix of feel-good warmth and devastation. George Takei does a wonderful job of portraying how a strong and loving family can find joy in the most trying of circumstances. The descriptions of those trying circumstances brought tears to my eyes more than once. This mix of emotions is heightened by the very talented illustrations of Harmony Becker. Beautifully done, well worth the read.",
