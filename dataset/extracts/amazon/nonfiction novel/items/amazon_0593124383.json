                "reviewText": "\u201cYummy: A History of Desserts\u201d is a baking history comic (written, illustrated, colored, & lettered) by Victoria Grace Elliott. Three food sprites (Peri, Fee, & Fada) take you through the history of various desserts, baked treats, & confections from their ancient origins & up til present. This is a very cute comic about baking. The sprites are adorable & each one has an individual personality / role (Peri is the main researcher & spokesperson / leader(?) / storyteller, Fee dresses up / cosplays historical figures for interview segments, & Fada heads the Science Lad). Some chapters are longer due to focusing on larger baking categories (cake, cookies) & others are more brief / spotlight chapters focused on more specific desserts (macarons). While not super in depth (it is aimed for children / all ages), I did learn a lot. There\u2019s a lot of focus on how global dessert history is & how cultures have interacted & modified various sweet foodstuffs. & of course, there are some recipes, which the sprites actually make in the panels.The art is very very cute. Kawaii even. This is definitely a lighter, nicer read, but it doesn\u2019t lack for content. I hope the author writes another, as it is left open given how many more desserts could be covered.Good for anyone who likes baking, cute art, or a calming / fun / chill read. \ud83d\udc9cBut where to shelve it? With my other cookbooks? Or comics? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\udc9c",
