                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bottom line: This book is great in helping to liberate the story of the Exodus",
                "reviewText": "As a rabbi, I collect haggadot, and just received this today. Sorry to say that I am two years too late (after publication, at least) on this one, but despite a few flaws that could have been fixed with some foresight, it is a refreshing and glorious rendition of the exodus story from the biblical book of Exodus, using modern referents to help the reader / seder participant / student of the bible learn how to use contemporary imagery to repair the world and put down the rule of tyranny.What is great and what can change in the next printing:The illustrations: They are joyful, colorful, helpful, truly creative, and mostly appropriate to the story of the exodus. Some are intense perhaps for younger children. The images are mostly gender binary, that is, most images that render people (as well as the goat that is a part-time narrator of the book) are either identifiably male or female, and in our world it would have been nice to see people whose gender was uncertain. There are a few images of Jews of color; there could have been more. Still, the illustrations tell the story along with a very understandable...English translation:I don't like particularly to criticize previous reviewers, but some people with online reviews mention that the English was lacking. TO.THE.CONTRARY: Every passage is translated directly and in modern form. The translation is sometimes scattered among the comic book illustrations, and is not linearly presented as the Hebrew or the transliterations. But take my word for it, it's all there. God is presented with male pronouns, something else the editors should consider changing in the next edition. The editors took care in presenting an English translation that is very loyal to the Hebrew. I also like the creative renderings and modernizations: the \"wicked\" child is presented as \"rebellious\", for example. I am not a fan of this new word, but the fact that the editors wanted to offer a very different translation, and one that is more loyal to the concept (in my opinion) of the haggadah, is very nice. I do not like the translation of God's name as \"Lord\" (because this is a male image), so again if you're in search of a genderless version of God, this is another example of hoping the next edition will be changed.Finally, and briefly, the whole concept of modernizing the text is great, and I wish this book continuing success.",

The illustrations are beautiful, and they perfectly capture the spirit and energy of the holiday.The Passover story is already an incredibly powerful tale, and this graphic novel brings that power to the fore. The characters are portrayed in a way that makes them feel real and relatable, and their struggles and triumphs are depicted with a depth that makes you feel like you know them. I love how they were able to present a very old story in such a new and exciting way.This is more than a Haggadah. It's a work of art.",

The quality of the text is fantastic (Koren, complete and traditional, beautifully printed Hebrew), and every single word is transliterated, which helps guests and family members who do not read Hebrew. The English translation is presented in complete graphic novel form, with amazing artwork and attention to detail. I absolutely love that the images are multi-gendered and multi-ethnic. The directions are given clearly and in a very gentle, non-patronizing way! If you don't know when to pick up or put down or refill your cup, for example, the guide is gentle and thorough.I bought one of these at a local comic book store (the only one they had), and immediately proceeded to buy two more from Amazon. I'm tempted to buy even more of them...",
