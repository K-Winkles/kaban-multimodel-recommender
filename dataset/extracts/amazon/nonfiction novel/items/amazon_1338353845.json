I'm not sure my daughter will end up writing a story, but I can say that she read this in it's entirety in one day. We had ran out of Raina's books and Sisters had been read so much that it fell apart. We saw this and she thought it was the new book we're waiting for. I explained that 'Share your Smile' is a guide to telling your own story and that Raina would be telling the reader different ways to communicate what they're trying to express on paper. She said she wanted it anyway so she could feel closer to how Raina's books make her feel. I had to agree. Ms. Telgemeier is a warm hug on a cold wet afternoon. Reading her books is the hot chocolate that cozies you up on that cold wet afternoon. Patiently waiting for Guts to be available.",
