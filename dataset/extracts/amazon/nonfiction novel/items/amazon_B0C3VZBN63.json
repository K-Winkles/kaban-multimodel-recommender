(No anxiety needed!) It was very well explained and the plot twist both surprised me and made me smile! Thank you Kevin and ChatGPT! I will definitely read the rest of Kevin's books and recommend to everyone. Also following \u2611\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcb0",

It will now be much easier to get back on track because I now have a ready assistant at my.beck and call. Thus is a wonderful and actually motivating little book.",

                "reviewText": "While I acknowledge the author's success in writing a book in 24 hours. It shows in the quality of the book. I also acknowledge that this was an experiment or proof of concept. However, had this been presented as a book of quality using succinct verbiage, it would only be a few chapters long and nowhere near the short read length that it is. Case in point, the first half of the book would easily be summarized into just a couple paragraphs since it contains a series of questions to where the answer to them all is the same.The work is further elongated using larger than traditional spacing, line spacing for example, and larger fonts to pad the work further.Again, I understand that this was a proof of concept experiment on how fast one can write a book in a short period. However, pushing out a low-quality book in a day was never in question as it happens all the time without AI. I feel that a better test would be to produce a high-quality book of any standard length using standard text/page formatting and succinct verbiage to reduce fluff/filler.",

Kevin has a unique way of guiding you through the content, keeping you entertained and motivated on each page.But most notably, without a doubt, is that it DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES: it truly teaches you how to write a book in a day, a challenge that would seem impossible if it weren't for Kevin's clear and practical support.The practical aspects of the book are evident in every chapter. Kevin tackles common problems faced by writers, such as writer's block and lack of motivation, and provides effective solutions with the help of ChatGPT.The book is also a great way to introduce artificial intelligence to those who are not yet familiar with it. Kevin has a knack for making technical concepts understandable and entertaining, even for those who are not experts in the field.Additionally, Kevin underscores the importance of maintaining your own voice and writing style when using artificial intelligence, ensuring that ChatGPT is a tool and not a replacement for human creativity. And despite being an educational resource, the book is not devoid of surprises, keeping the reader on tenterhooks until the end.As if all of this were not enough, the book tackles passive income generation through the use of ChatGPT in self-publishing, providing a new and intriguing dimension to an already extraordinary work.In summary, 'ChatGPT for Authors' is an innovative and valuable book that all writers, aspiring or experienced, should have in their library. Not only will it teach you to improve your writing process with ChatGPT, but it will also inspire you to put into practice what you learn. Thank you, Kevin, for sharing your knowledge and experience with the world.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. A pleasant and easy-to-read book. As in the rest of his books, Kevin guides you hand in hand and keeps you entertained at all times.Most importantly, without a doubt, and the secret of his success is that he delivers what he promises. I read the book in an afternoon, put it into practice the next day, and indeed, I managed to finish my book in less than 24 hours. I had spent months with an idea circulating in my head, but I could not find a way to start: some days due to lack of time, others due to lack of motivation, other times I didn't know where to start...If you are a writer, or aspire to be one, you need to read this book. It will undoubtedly make your journey much easier. Take it from a writer (who got scared by the arrival of ChatGPT).",
