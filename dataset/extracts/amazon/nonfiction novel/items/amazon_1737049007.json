        "description": "What if You Could Experience The Thrill of an Epic Voyage Through Insurmountable Obstacles Without Leaving The Comfort of Your Own Home? It was 23 months after his accident and Peter was still dealing with constant excruciating pain.He'd seen dozens of doctors and tried a myriad of medications, but nothing seemed to work. Faced with the impossible choice of suffering through the rest of his life, he had an unlikely epiphany: \"If I could somehow hike 2,000 miles on the Appalachian Trail, then my leg will have to be better.\"He set a starting date three weeks out, cobbled together a novice's pack, and set off on a journey destined to change his life forever\u2014though not exactly how he had envisioned it.From the bleakest breakdowns to hilarious adventures, Peter's story is equal parts entertaining, enthralling, and enlightening.Join him on the trail, one step in front of the other, as he searches for some way to heal his body and soul while struggling with chronic pain, anxiety and depression.Can Reading This Book Really Change Your Life?Discover how to overcome insurmountable obstacles one step at a time.Experience the joy and freedom of hiking the Appalachian Trail (while wrapped up in a blanket at home).Get a boost for your body and soul as you laugh your way through his hilarious antics and adventures.Enjoy the relief you experience as you walk with the author while escaping from your day to day concerns.If you've enjoyed best selling memoirs & biographies by authors like Cheryl Strayed, Bill Bryson, and Grandma Gatewood, then you'll enjoy this inspiring memoir about hiking the Appalachian Trail. If you're struggling to find hope and healing after trauma, you'll find encouragement to get back up. You might even find the courage to give solo travel a try yourself.Scroll Up to Buy NowFrom the bleakest breakdowns to hilarious adventures, Peter's story is equal parts entertaining, enthralling, and enlightening. Join him on the trail, one step in front of the other, in search of healing body and soul. Everyone endures their own hardships in life, but fewer people have the courage to walk alone into the unknown to change it. Peter's stubbornly hopeful pursuit of a better life left me shaken, inspired, and grateful; a thru-hike is now on my bucket list, but so is taking smaller steps towards my dreams today. There's something about his story that sticks with you and makes you think. If he can do that, I can do anything. - Karina MonessonFrom the forward...As a hiker with my own challenges I fell in love with this book. It captures the insanity that I experienced first hand during my time on the trail with the author. I really enjoyed hiking the Appalachian Trail but when I can\u2019t hike, I enjoy reading hiking books before going to bed. This book has elements of trauma recovery just like Cheryl Strayed\u2019s bestselling book Wild, where she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone. It was after the author shared his inner struggles with anxiety and panic attacks while interweaving hilarious stories reminiscent of Bill Bryson\u2019s bestseller, A Walk in The Woods, that I realized I can\u2019t put it down. After I finish reading this for the third time (yes, it\u2019s that good!) it\u2019s going on the shelf right between my two other all time favorite page turner novels, John Grisham\u2019s The Judge\u2019s List and The Boys by Ron Howard. Don\u2019t let the title make you think this is a foot injury story - it\u2019s an amazing journey from the depths of the author\u2019s heart and soul. - Gail \u201cDr Fix-it\u201d Hinshaw - Author of Katahdin or Bust: Increasing Your Odds of Enjoying Hiking or BackpackingScroll Up to Buy Now",

I have so many more questions about how to accomplish this journey. I feel like I could sit down with him and interview him for days.

The book is a well balanced and artful blend of courage and introspection.The day to day struggles managing a major disability while dealing with the immense difficulty of logistics on a 2200 mile \"walk\" was an amazing feat. I particularly admired his courage to admit to readers of his almost daily doubts on the choice to put himself through all the suffering as an alternate means of Physical Therapy. This book truly deserves a spot in the top Thru Hiker Narratives. Very Inspirational!",

                "reviewText": "I'd like to give this author 5 stars on his perseverance on finishing the AT with his disability, but I had a hard time with his writing in general that made it difficult for me to really love the book in a 5 star manner. He mentioned his injury in detail multiple (did I say multiple?) times and why he had to finish this trail as if we never read it before. I also found delivery on humorous events not very funny, so my criteria for a book that I would recommend to others are: It has to be well written. It has to make me laugh out loud and it has to make me cry. That didn\u2019t happen. I wish him the best in his life and continued healing!",

                "reviewText": "I've read a lot of books about Appalachian Trail experiences, and I found this one to be one of the most inspiring. It was really a very good story about perseverance and overcoming struggles. I subtracted one star because I think it just needed a little more editing. For example, the name of the shelter near the top of Mount Rogers in Virginia is Thomas ( not Thompson ) Knob. It was a good read.",
