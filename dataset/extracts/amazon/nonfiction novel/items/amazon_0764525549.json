As I approached the middle sections, it was clear that there was no turning back. My heart was won, but my mother and my husband would never accept my new pathway, plus they would be deeply wounded in their dear hearts by my actions. But, what can one do when the star of love leads this way or that? And that was not the first danger! The first real fright came packaged with dark hair, blue eyes, a curious scar along the left cheekbone, and a sardonic smile...",

                "reviewText": "I have read several \"how to\" guides on both writing fiction and more specifically, writing romantic fiction. The thing that really stands out with this book, is that Leslie Wainger believes YOU CAN DO IT! She really believes in you. If you read this and heed her advice, there is a good chance that you may just be able to publish a romance novel.Whereas a lot of the other books are constantly reminding a novice writer that there is a very slim chance that she will ever be able to publish anything, this book is reassuringly positive. Leslie Wainger never underplays the fact that writing is hard work and takes a lot of time, patience and both physical and emotional energy, but she continuously offers positive reinforement for the efforts of the beginning writer.This book illustrates an idea to get you started that I have never seen in a \"how to\" guide or even in the many writing workshops and classes that I have completed. I am so excited by some of the ideas and secrets that Ms. Wainger shares in her positive, upbeat manner, that I have ideas for many new books!I strongly recommend that if you are serious about writing romance, you do not overlook this valuable trove of information!",

This book helped me get started. I thought that I would get very little 'new' information out of it, but my husband encouraged me to get it, and boy was I ever wrong! This book gave me some tips on things I had not considered and even some new info that I never knew about. All I can say is that if you are a BRAND NEW romance writer, this IS the book for you! The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that I found it a bit...wordy. haha I think some of the info could have been condensed into a smaller, \"just-the-facts\" book. But still a wonderful reference book that I will keep on the shelf for many years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I have always loved writing stories but it got lost along the way. Then I discovered fanfiction (yes, and I am not ashamed of it) and thought this was a good way to worm myself back into a hobby that I though I had lost forever. Although I think I'm an OK enough writer for the internet platform I'm using, there's always things to learn and to improve and as we all know, practice makes perfect. I stumbled across this book through browsing and bought it without thinking twice.What a good idea! It's very helpful, very insightful - it touches plotting, character development, conflict approach, romance-related dynamics, outlining, and it does all that without raised fingers and preaching undertone. It's clearly written by someone who knows what she's talking about and who enjoys passing her knowledge on.If you'd like to tackle your own romance novel but are unsure about how to get it done... this book will be a great friend in need!",

                "reviewTitle": "Excellent advice from an experienced editor",
                "reviewText": "This is one of a few 'romance writing' books that I keep on my desk. Leslie Waigner has produced a comprehensive guide to writing romantic fiction, and as editor at US publisher Harlequin and speaker on the craft, this lady knows what she is talking about.This book happily coexists alongside Leigh Michaels' 'On Writing Romance' and Kate Walker's '12 Point Guide to Writing Romance'. I say this because Waigner's perspective is that of an editor, and while she examines the key elements of romance writing such as conflict, climax, and resolution, her style of writing is lighter with less in-depth examples of dos and don'ts. See Michaels or Walker for this.However, Waigner makes up for this in many ways. She includes really useful sections that the others just touch on, for example, setting up a space in your home for writing, doing the dreaded but necessary focus on your finances and accounts, what to look out for when you are negotiating a publishing deal, as well as technical stuff like US versus UK word-counting (news to me!), and reorganising your life in order to fit in a daily word output.The book is well structured, and I myself always learn something new. Highly recommended.",
