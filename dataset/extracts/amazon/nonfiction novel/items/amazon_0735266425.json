                "reviewText": "This sweet non-fiction book is just wonderful and very kid-friendly as is the whole series of \"Disgusting Critters.\" Meet Diane, the cockroach, an adorable character even though she belongs to that dreaded species. Cockroaches are not the house guests you would desire because once they are inside it's extremely hard to get rid of them.The talented author/ illustrator shines a light on the dreaded COCKROACH much to a cockroach's dismay because they hate light and emerge at night, in the dark, to do their dastardly deeds. They eat everything, deposit ghastly germs all around, can cause allergies and they produce stinky smells. Not quite the house guest you would desire to be under your roof or anywhere else inside your home.The author gives fast, easy to understand, cockroach facts which are enriched by quirky, humourous asides by Diane. Giving her the ability to talk, and seeing her antics as she does, enables kids to remember the scientific information that the author doles out for the reader. It's quite ingenious and lots of fun!The book talks about the lifestyle of the cockroach: physical traits, diet, running skills ( fastest among insects ), reproduction ability ( female can birth up to 350 babies during her lifetime), just to name a few.I highly recommend this book as it both highly entertaining and is educational also. Kid's will love it! ( and adults too )",

I love that there are real facts, but they are presently simply and easy to read. So many non-fiction kid books are hard to read ooutloud because there are so many blurbs and boxes and inserts on each page, and it gets so wordy. This one was informative, adorable, and fun!",

                "reviewText": "'The Cockroach' by Elise Gravel is a hilarious non-fiction book for young readers.Just like in 'The Bat' we are introduced to a cartoon cockroach and we learn things about her. Things like distinctive traits and diet. What baby cockroaches look like and where to find them (and where to hopefully never find them).I don't know that I gained any new appreciation for this species, but the book did make me smile as I read it. A younger version of myself into odd animals would have probably loved this book. The illustrations are fun.I received a review copy of this ebook from Tundra Books, Penguin Random House Canada, and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this ebook.",
