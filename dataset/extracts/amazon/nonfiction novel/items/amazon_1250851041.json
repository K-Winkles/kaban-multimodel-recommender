                "reviewText": "This is the first book that I have read by Dan Santat. I was drawn to this book because he was a recent National Book Award Winner. I have read his other book called Misfits which he illustrated with author Lisa Yee. A First Time for Everything was an enjoyable read for several reasons. First of all, I have a young teenage son, that is getting ready to start high school soon. He is close to the same age as the main character in this book. I found a lot of Dan\u2019s experiences and feelings very relatable to what my son is going through now. I would love for him to have an experience like this, seeing all of Europe with your friends. Some of the experiences that Dan had, definitely would not be happening in today\u2019s age, but they were still priceless.I found the book very nostalgic. I remember what life was like back in 1989, mixed tapes, Sony Walkman, Fanta soda, family being able to walk you to the airport gate. Traveling without cellphones or being in constant contact with your parents, what freedom. But, now as a parent, the thought of not being able to get in touch with my kids frightens me.I have to say that Mrs. Bjork, Dan\u2019s speech teacher, was my favorite character. She was so sweet and seemed to know what Dan was going through. However, she did set him up for disaster when she had Dan practice his speech in front of the entire school. Since this book was so personal (a graphic novel memoir), this was what made the story so good and compelling. I definitely cannot wait to see what Dan comes out with next.",

                "reviewText": "Dan Santat's wonderful new middle school GN memoir \"A First Time for Everything\" recounts his adventures on his first out of the country visit to Europe with some other students in the summer between middle school and high school. It was a super beautiful story about first kisses, first Fantas, and about finally finding yourself. It was a wonderful little book that put me in the frame of mind of both my summer my first and only visit to Europe, the summer in college I spent in Rome. It was fun to reminisce about the crazy misadventures I have had. But more than that, it reminded me to think back on the people I met in these adventures growing up. If you read this book as an adult, I hope it brings back a flood of fond memories, like it did for me. But if you read this as young person, I hope you take it as an invitation to try new things and take on new adventures...",
