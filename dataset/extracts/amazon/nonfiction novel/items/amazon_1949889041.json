            "Editorial Reviews Review BOOKLIST -- True-crime writer Schechter teams up with acclaimed comic-book artist Powell in this thoroughly researched account of Ed Gein, the notorious murderer who inspired the horror icon Norman Bates (and others). Schechter and Powell start there, with a portly Alfred Hitchcock setting the scene. Then, they cover Gein's childhood under the thumb of his puritanical, misogynistic, and violently oppressive mother; the investigation into his crimes; and the trial that led to his lifelong incarceration. Powell's soft, realistic art, in a green-tinged grayscale recalling the aesthetic quality of Hitchcock's black-and-white films, renders faces beautifully, keeping them distinct and recognizable even as they age over the decades-long timeframe of the book, and though there's plenty of gruesomeness, he only toes the line of luridness (an inevitability, for sure, in any book about Gein). While Schechter and Powell necessarily spend plenty of time on Gein, they don't dwell sensationally on the horrors of his crimes but turn their attention to his impact not only on the culture but, importantly, on the lives of his neighbors. A natural choice for true-crime fans. Review \u201cEric Powell and Harold Schechter team up to tell the true story of Ed Gein in a unique format for true crime.

In 1999 Eric launched his critically acclaimed creator owned series THE GOON. In 2002 Eric Launched ALBATROSS EXPLODING FUNNYBOOKS in an effort to keep the Goon alive when no other publisher wanted it because it was too 'different'. But the readers spoke and the Goon quickly became an indy hit and picked up a diehard cult following. The Goon found a home and a wider audience with DARK HORSE COMICS, but Eric continued to publish creator owned comics through Albatross such as his all ages comic CHIMICHANGA and Rebecca Sugar\u2019s PUG DAVIS. Eric has spent his career creating and promoting the validity and importance of creator owned comics through Albatross and other publishers such as Dark Horse and Image Comics.In 2016 Eric rededicated himself in earnest to his publishing company, ALBATROSS FUNNYBOOKS, and launched his new fantasy series HILLBILLY, his kid's horror anthology SPOOK HOUSE, as well as other creator owned titles.Eric has been working in collaboration with acclaimed director David Fincher, Tim Miller, and Blur Studios to bring the Goon to life on the big screen as an animated feature film.Awards:\u2022 International Horror Guild: 2004 Best Illustrated Narrative\u2022 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: 2004 Best Single Issue (Goon #1)\u2022 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: 2005 Best Humor Publication\u2022 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: 2005 Best Continuing Series\u2022 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: 2008 Best Writer/Artist-Humor\u2022 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: 2008 Best Painter or Multimedia Artist Read more"

Because, in this case, the truth needs no embellishment to be horrifying.",

                "reviewText": "Don't miss this ! Even if you're not a big \"Gein fan\" , this work is outstanding (both text and art). It should win an Eisner, if there's any justice.I never bought any of Eric Powell's previous works, because the character design of The Goon looked too 'cartoon-ey' for my tastes. His art here is lovely (despite the morbid and gruesome nature of the subject matter) as well as pretty realistic, with exaggerations only as needed to convey emotion. Lovely, moody black and white with 'gray wash' ... Superlative, but I thought pp 96-97, where the sheriff's flashlights can only illuminate small circles of space in the blackness, to be particularly effective, and pp 146-150, wherein Powell tries to take the reader into Gein's mind and his fantasies. The way Gein's pop culture tastes shaped his fantasy world reminded me of Peter Vronsky's comments on how \"men's adventure magazines\" affected him as a child.Harold Schechter's Deviant is a book I've read and reread too many times to count. I was a little concerned that this would be basically just a GN adaptation of a work I already own, but it is far beyond that, and I appreciate the research that went into this, as shown by the appendices. I especially like pp 86-92, which very effectively convey the Eisenhower Era. And the decision to jump from Augusta Gein's death to the murder of Bernice Worden and its aftermath, and then to recount what happened in the year's between as a flashback/retrospective worked quite well.PSA : When I reread Deviant, there are some paragraphs I avoid : Murder, grave robbing, necrophilia-? Eh... Animal abuse/caninocide-? Unbearable. If you're the same way (*and I was dreading that event's recounting*) avoid pp75-76. Otherwise : This is a book not to be missed .",

While much is conjecture, it is based on firsthand accounts and source material where available. The author takes care to propose a feasible psychiatric profile.This is a serious work that avoids cheap scares. Yes, there is horrific imagery, but not to the degree one would expect from such a ghastly tale. Both the author and illustrator are serious and sober in their story telling.It is a quick read, but well worth the price.",

It truly gives a different viewpoint of a serial killer and delves into the PSYCHOLOGY of it all and the nature vs nurture and environmental stresses, the evils of society, the dangers of over zealous religion, alcoholism, and other topics! 5/5 ! I hope the make this 1st in a long series of studies! Informative, but creative and interesting.",

                "reviewText": "I heard about this book during pre-release while listening to the guys on Last Podcast on the Left. Once received, I dove right in. The assessment of facts based on the research paired with the gorgeous art just made this an absolute winner in my book. It took me about an hour to get through the entirety\u2014 and it left me completely satisfied but then wanting the next installment to explore another famed killer. I would love to see more graphic novels by these folks outlining the essentials of the notorious characters that make up the fringe of our society. If there is an art to this topic\u2014 these guys figured it out. Absolutely A+++.",
