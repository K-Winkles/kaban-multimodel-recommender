Goldratt was an educator, author, physicist, philosopher and business leader. He is best known as the father of the Theory of Constraints (TOC), a process of ongoing improvement that continuously identifies and leverages a system's constraints in order to achieve its goals. As a consultant and advisor to major corporations and government agencies around the world, Dr. Goldratt was heralded as a guru to industry by Fortune magazine and a genius by Business Week. His first business novel, The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, has been a bestseller since 1984. With more than 7 million copies sold worldwide, it is recognized as one of the bestselling business books of all time. He authored ten other books, including the business novels, It's Not Luck (the sequel to The Goal), Critical Chain, Necessary but Not Sufficient and Isn't It Obvious?. He also developed TOC-derived tools such as Drum-Buffer-Rope, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and the Thinking Processes, and continued to advance the TOC body of knowledge until his death in 2011."

        "description": "Alex Rogo is a harried plant manager who has been given 90 days to save his failing factory. If he doesn't improve the plant's performance, corporate headquarters will close it down and hundreds of workers will lose their jobs. It takes a chance meeting with Jonah, a former professor, to help him break out of his conventional thinking and figure out what needs to be done. As Alex identifies the plant's problems and works with his team to find solutions, the reader gains an understanding of the fundamental concepts behind the Theory of Constraints. Visual and fun to read, The Goal: A Business Graphic Novel offers an accessible introduction to the Theory of Constraints concepts presented in The Goal, the business novel on which it was based. The Goal is widely considered to be one of the most influential business books of all time. A bestseller since it was first published in 1984, the business novel has sold over 7 million copies, been translated into 32 languages and is taught in colleges, universities, and business schools around the world. Named to Time magazine's list of the 25 Most Influential Business Management Books, it is frequently cited by executives as a favorite or must-read title.",

And you call yourself a book reviewer?\u201dThis past spring here in the bunker, a colleague emailed me and asked if I had ever reviewed \u201cThe Goal\u201d by Eli Goldratt. Reviewed it? I\u2019d never even heard about it. (Yikes). He recommended this bestselling business book\u2014and I immediately ordered it. He said it \u201creads somewhat like a Lencioni novel and is relevant for every organization and leader.\u201dBut\u2026full confession. I cheated and ordered the business graphic novel of \u201cThe Goal.\u201d Big print and pictures. Just 130 pages. This \u201cIntroduction to the Theory of Constraints\u201d will be immediately applicable to anyone with too many moving parts, too many spinning plates, too much or not enough inventory, and keeping the whole team moving in the right direction\u2014at the right pace.How did I miss this important book? Apparently, others have missed it also. Read the front page story in the Aug. 21, 2020, edition of The Wall Street Journal: \u201cWhy Are There Still Not Enough Paper Towels?\u201d (The answer: blame lean manufacturing.) Maybe P&G didn\u2019t make \u201cThe Goal\u201d required reading. (Jeff Bezos does.)Verne Harnish, author of my 2018 book-of-the year, \u201cScaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It\u2026and Why the Rest Don\u2019t (Mastering the Rockefeller Habits 2.0),\u201d gushes: \u201cThe Goal is the #1 business book of all time and the graphic adaptation makes this timeless classic and its powerful ideas even more accessible. If you only read one business book, it should be this one.\u201dThe author, Eliyahu M. Goldratt (1947-2011) is known as the father of the Theory of Constraints (TOC), \u201ca process of ongoing improvement that continuously identifies and leverages a system's constraints in order to achieve its goals.\u201d A bestseller since 1984, the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide.\u201cThe Goal\u201d is one of Time Magazine's \u201c25 Most Influential Business Management Books.\u201d (I\u2019m only half-way through that list. Yikes, again.)The author\u2019s business novel approach is brilliant. The interesting (and often humorous) story makes TOC understandable.Watch for:\u2022 3 measurements\u2022 Bottlenecks and non-bottlenecks\u2022 Wrong assumptions: \u201cworkers must produce 100 percent of the time\u2026\u201d\u2022 Maximum stupidity (the difference between utilizing a resource versus activating a resource): \u201cSo running a non-bottleneck machine to its maximum is an act of maximum stupidity.\u201d\u2022 POOGI (Process of OnGoing Improvement): \u201cThere is always room for better results.\u201d\u2022 The 5 Focusing Steps of the Theory of ConstraintsTechnical? Yes. You may not manage an industrial plant, but you might lead a Scout or family hike one day with a dozen campers who hike at different speeds. Insightful? Yes\u2014the real life hiking example turns complexity into a manageable process and cleverly explains The Theory of Constraints.Did I mention this? \u201cJeff Bezos has made \u201cThe Goal\u201d required reading for his top executives at Amazon, where it has been called \u2018a bible\u2019 for the team behind the company\u2019s fulfillment network.\u201d And \u201cFortune Magazine\u201d compared \u201cThe Goal\u2019s\u201d leading character to \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi instructing Luke Skywalker on the use of the force.\u201dHopefully this is enough to inspire you to read the book\u2014or delegate the reading of the book to someone on your team.",

You have to do the translation yourself though, and that\u2019s my only nitpick. Working in marketing for a software company, we aren\u2019t using machines to produce physical goods. But the core ideas still apply \u2014 you have to identifty the goal that represents success, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize them above all else.

I have also had people say they can't relate the specific example in this book to their own situation, which is another reason to use the long version.

As I read various business books from time-to-time, this book has always held my interest and I have referred to it over the years. The graphic novel is a great way to shorten the time to get refamiliarized with the material. I think that the book has more details, but this is a great way to read this classic book in a short amount of time.",
