                "reviewText": "The book covers some of Tesla's inventions. What is also interesting is the overview of his philosophy of life. He believed in clean living. That is very interesting. I also recently read about Isaac Newton's similar purity standard. Newton remained chaste and unmarried his entire life. This is something the Holy Spirit has been teaching me very carefully over the last several months. Basically, living a right life is more important than living a right life for its own sake alone. There are implications. Look at Tesla and Newton: they are the ones blessed with great wisdom, ability, insight, and productivity.I will read this again in the future.",

I never expected this thought for world peace \" When all darkness shall be dissipated by the light of science, when all nations are merged into one, and patriotism shall be identical with religion, when there shall be one language, one country, one end, then the dream will have become a reality.\" Written about 1889.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this book from Amazon LLC with Prime 2 day shipping. It showed up on cue of course, but I find that reviews would be better on Amazon if all the reviewers stated what shipper they used, considering different shippers and sellers may be sending totally different products and the faults of one provider does not way on another.Now onto the text. The subtle parallels that Tesla draws between the actions of human life and their effect on our overall well being is astounding. As a man who contributed so much to the world already, discovering that Tesla was an ingenious writer pushed me over the edge. If you're on the border of buying or not buying, BUY. 100%.That being said, this particular version of this book doesn't ruin the experience. It's about half an inch thick, 10 inches tall and 5 inches wide. The pictures are perfectly readable inside, but black and white. I did notice several spelling and grammar errors in the book, but when checked online I realized they were Tesla's mistakes, simply copied for historical merit. I ordered my book on the 20th, and according to the back page it was printed that same day.All in all, it's 5 star material in a 3 star book. But it's cheap. And amazing. I'd read it on a napkin. Absolutely recommended.EDIT: Although this book is cheap, the plastic binding on it hold up very well. There is still no visible damage on the cover or the pages. The content is inspiring, insightful, and clever. The binding is strong. What's not to love about this Tesla book?",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent proposition of how to \"increase human energy,\" assuming that is actually a good thing. Tesla follows the general idea that doing so is necessary for human progress, but we are seeing that merely increasing our energy consumption and our literal mass will not be all for the good. I was disappointed that he did not refer to the actual harnessing of the sun's energy as we know it today: photovoltaic technology. This was mere years before Einstein published his findings on the photoelectric effect and I guess Tesla didn't hear about it.However, he seemed prescient regarding the benefits of vegetarianism, although I'm still not ready to embrace it myself. And foresaw an arms race (did happen) that would lead to automatons doing all the fighting (still in our imaginations and increasingly bad Terminator projects only, but getting closer).",
