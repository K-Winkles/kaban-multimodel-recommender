                "reviewText": "Full disclosure, I stopped reading the book. First, the typos and grammar errors were hard to ignore. The reason I didn't finish though was the blatantly wrong information. I was going to consider these minor interpretive errors to keep the stories concise. I can't overlook them when they are so wrong that misinformation is spread. A fact checker could have corrected things like the number of states in 1920. The author asserts 50; there were 48. So, I skimmed a few after this and found more factual errors. Also, the references sections needs to be cleaned up and listed by chapter or properly in alphabetical order. As it stands now it is an unorganized mess with more typos.",
