There's lots and lots of discussion and writing prompts - that section is actually great. But activities for those students who need something a little different is definitely lacking. The allegorical information is also quite thorough. Maybe this would be a better fit for a more advanced class. Just not quite as good as for the reluctant learner as the other Novel Units I've used.",
