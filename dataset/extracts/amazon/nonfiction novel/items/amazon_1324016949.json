His story of hunger and hardship threaded with hope illuminates the lived experience of poverty in America. The compelling true story of a high school career defined by outbursts of domestic violence at home. Moments of grace and humor act as beacons of light in Rex\u2019s dark struggle against the cycle of violence. The summer before he graduates high school, Rex is kicked out his home for being gay, and he ends up on the streets. His reflection on his hunger\u2014for food, for love, and for a home\u2014completes his trilogy of moving memoirs. Throughout a childhood marked by violence, Abuela\u2019s red-brick house offered Rex the possibility of home. In this poetry collection, Rex honors Abuela\u2019s legacy as a pillar of comfort, safety, and love.",

                "reviewText": "I had to read this book over the past week for my sophomore year honors literature class at BGSU. This book was heartbreaking, as it tells the story of Rex Ogle\u2019s sixth grade year that was full of abuse, neglect, and too many horrifying events that a child should not have to experience. The memoir touches on many topics that are hard for some to discuss, but are still very important to talk about. After reading this book, my class had the honor of meeting Rex Ogle, the author, and learning more about him, while getting the chance to ask questions about him and his writings! He is an awesome guy, and his story is one that should be shared to all who want to hear it\u2014 it truly allows the reader to put into perspective their own life, while picking up on life lessons through every page. (I also rated this book moderate for the \u201cdifficulty\u201d level because while its an easy ready vocabulary wise, it does take mental strength to read about the things that Rex had to go through\u2014 especially if the reader had experienced things similar)",
