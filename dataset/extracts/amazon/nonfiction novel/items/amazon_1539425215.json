                "reviewText": "This is more like a children's book than anything I would consider a \"short novel\". There are only about 10 sentences per page and they are mostly very short sentences. It's 140 pages, but that's only 70 if you consider that there's a Spanish and English version of each page, so it's just not very much content for the price. There are awkward and clunky translations throughout. In addition, it's just full of errors. On nearly every page there are at least a few small errors such as missing spaces, but also some typos like \"LLightning\". There are also grammatical errors like \"Lightning illuminate the room\" instead of \"Lightning illuminates the room\".Overall, I would say it is an interesting way to learn and I understand the need for short, simple sentences and not much plot in a book for language learners. But with all the errors and clunky writing, it's just not worth the price.",
