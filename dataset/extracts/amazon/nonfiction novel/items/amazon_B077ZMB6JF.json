Last night I had the sudden urge to know the order of every Dennis Lehane series, but was at a loss for ways to acquire said information, as I have stated I hate using search engines. Thankfully I was able to purchase this book and find out what I needed to know, and even got treated to a brief synopsis for each book! No longer do you need the hassle and inconvenience of Google. Best 99 cents a person can spend. Thanks, Book Guru!",
