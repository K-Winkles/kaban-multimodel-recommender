Although there are dark themes explored in the narrative, I think the author did a good job keeping the story simple enough for a child to understand, yet leave room to ask more questions.The end of the story is very inspiring. So many important lessons to be gleaned from this woman\u2019s life!This is an important story that needs to be told- more so than ever!",
