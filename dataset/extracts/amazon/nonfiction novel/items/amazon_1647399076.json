                "reviewText": "This book has a variety of panel layouts, gives a guide on how to lay out your panels -- showing how panels are read, which direction, which one first, giving a lot of interesting guidelines/suggestions/thoughts on what artists are doing as they are laying out a Comic Book or Graphic novel.This isn't about how to draw a person... but how to use this medium with the person you are drawing... how to do speech bubbles, how to think through the panels... a lot of stuff that kids who love reading comics and enjoying drawing could learn a lot from.I do wish it was easier to remove the pages and \"shuffle the order\" of the layouts once a story was in mind... but... that might be asking for a lot from a bound book.When I showed this to the Comic Book Reader in the family (and long time collector) he mentioned that some of the panel layouts were not ones he saw very often and were not ones he would suggest for a first time artist, some were challenging to fit in, some were challenging to clearly show the reader how to move between. I was intrigued by that feedback, but as the non-Comic Reader, trying to encourage a child's interest... I wasn't sure what to do with the information.",
