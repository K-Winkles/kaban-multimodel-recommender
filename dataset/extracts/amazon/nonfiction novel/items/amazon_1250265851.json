Whew - it is dense, full of lots of information, so much so that you really do have to spend time discussing the concepts and not just reading it straight through. My little loves it though and has asked to read more of it each of the past three nights. I am pretty sure this is going to stay in his top science books rotation. We have lots of favorites from the same series that he comes back to over and over - Plagues, Cars, the Brain, Volcanoes, Trees, the Solar System, Rocks & Minerals, Bats, Wild Weather, and Digestion.",

The pace is half-hazard and the art is a bit confusing. The science doesn\u2019t tie into the story as well as the other books.
