            "Editorial Reviews From Booklist Alison Bechdel\u2019s Are You My Mother? (2012) explored a lesbian cartoonist\u2019s relationship with her mother, both in the past and in the present. Georges\u2019 memoir may be broadly categorized as examining similar ground in the same format, but here the memories, the mother, and the cartoonist herself bring very different details to the work, and thus provide a very different tale. Georges\u2019 quirky, big-faced, and evocative drawings, tempered by a variety of panel sizes, show the bespectacled author as she comes to terms with her mother\u2019s lies to her as a child about her father being dead; her girlfriend\u2019s impatience with the adult Georges\u2019 tolerance for her mother\u2019s intolerance; the clutch of dogs (and a chicken or three) and the stuffed animals who safeguard Georges\u2019 sense of security in both youth and young adulthood; and the attraction Dr. Laura Schlessinger offers in her pat, specific directions for relief from the discomforts of uncertainty. An excellent graphic memoir offering engaging insights for those who share\u2014or don\u2019t share\u2014any of Georges\u2019 worries and traits. --Francisca Goldsmith Review \"Honest and charming...[Georges] makes her debut as a developed and skilled storyteller.\"-Philadelphia Inquirer \"A charmer.\"-Cleveland Plain Dealer \"A bracing debut from a promising graphic novelist that deals with abuse, forgiveness, and family secrets.\"-Daily Beast \"There's a depth to Georges' work...an intense interest in finding out not just who she is but what it means and why it matters.\"-Oregonian A \"tart, honest graphic memoir.\"-Slate \"A tragicomic graphic memoir with a stunning indie aesthetic.\"-Bookslut \u201cAn engrossing, lovable, smart and ultimately poignant trip through a harrowing emotional bottleneck in family life.

What a wonderful book.\u201d -Rachel Maddow \"Engaging...incisive...The author approaches [her story] with the tenacity of a detective.\" -Publishers Weekly \"Nicole Georges spins a riveting family mystery. There's a powerful chemistry going on between her delicate drawings and the probing honesty of her investigations. CALLING DR. LAURA is disarming and haunting, hip and sweet, all at once.\" -Alison Bechdel \"I wouldn't want to live in a world without Nicole! And now no one has to! This book is a charming little gem. An honest glimpse into the life of a self-employed, smart and witty Portland femme gay with an upbringing so weird it's normal.\" -Beth Ditto \"Anyone who knows Portland, OR. will know Nicole J. Georges, the witty girl with the cat glasses and a devoted following for her talents as an illustrator and zinester . . . Whatever the results, one can bet that this new work from Georges will be a good time.\" -Lambda Literary, \"Five New Queer Voices to Watch Out For\" \u2014 About the Author Nicole J.

(Not to mention her knockout ink wash art style that I cannot get enough of - the details! The patterns!)I was also so moved by the journey she goes on in the book. I feel like so many families have a least one polite fiction or topic that is not discussed (if not more, haha). It takes such courage to pull back the curtain on those family secrets. Georges' story made me to reflect on my own history - what stories have we been told about ourselves and our childhoods? What do those stories cost us?So many laugh-out-loud moments, such artful storytelling, and such a powerful journey. 10/10. Get it for yourself and then get a copy for a friend.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Lovely indie memoir of family disfunction",
                "reviewText": "What a great memoir!Calling Dr Laura is the raw and honest memoir of graphic artist Nicole J. Georges from her childhood to this day and her life in Portland Oregon. The novel focuses on her search for her natural father, her coming out of the closet as a queer, and the process of finding who she is as person. The book has a good deal of her childhood memories and family related issues, which are not adorned or sweetened, but presented in a very naive straight forward way. She could have demonized her mother for the whole story related to her natural father, but she does not so; she does not hide anything bad about her life, experiences or people she comes across, but she does not judge them and focus more on how she felt or feels. How difficult to do and how well done! The narrative alternates the present with episodes of her childhood. The parts about her childhood are really wonderful but also a bit sad.The reading is very engaging. That is so because the book is well paced regarding the subjects presented and how they are presented, the U-turns that the author makes but still coming back to the main road, so to speak. The story is never bland or boring. Although the mystery in the novel is resolved in the epilogue, it lingers throughout the book without being overpowering.I truly liked Georges' style and versatility. She uses different graphic languages and fonts to convey meaning and create atmosphere. Although most of the book is set in interiors, I loved her drawings of road and urban landscapes. The drawings of her childhood episodes, which are very simple and child-like, are just adorable, and very different from the more elaborate and arty drawing for the narration of Nicole's present. I think this is one of those books that would have been great having it in full colour, as the book cover's image is.My favourite scenes are her story of her intestinal problems when she was a kid, the one of the boat when Radar dumps Nickie, and Nickie's fight with her mother in the car about she being a selfish brat. I also love the dog's language balloons she adds when she communicates with her dogs or they don't know what is happening - very cute.",

The simplicity of the dialogue and the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the drawings nevertheless packs a punch to anyone with mother-child issues. And who doesn't have those? It totally threw me when I noticed the sleepiness that came on Nicole whenever she spent time with her mother. It effectively opened my eyes about something I just hadn't seen for 30 years! Despite my wisdom and insight. Blaming Depression for my tendency to sleep life away when in reality it is unfinished work I have with my mother. If this is Too Personal for you, beg pardon, but it shows how a media once thought of as a childhood amusement can be translated to something else entirely. Would highly recommend for people like me, a teeming multitude!",

I adored this book and purposely made it last two days, although it could have been read in a few hours' time. I just wanted to savor her bittersweet story and the little world created by this lovely novel. Also, the book itself is much larger and heavier than I expected especially for the price paid.

But I loved it so much, I wanted to have a copy on my Kindle. There are some real gems in this book. My favorite part is where she talks about fainting goats, which seems to be a non sequitur as you're reading it, until it segues into her having a discussion with her partner and, well, I don't want to ruin it for you, but it's particularly brilliant. It reminds me of Allison Bechdel's autobiographical graphic stories, and that is high praise. Great story and well-illustrated.",

Some of the text is hard to read and you can\u2019t really follow the story by the pictures. Her story is not that interesting. She adopts a chicken? Weirdo.Most of it consists of her talking about her wacked-out childhood. I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s too all over the place. Makes no sense. I thought it would be funny, but it\u2019s just too weird and stupid.",

I cannot recommend this book enough. Thank you, Nicole!",

After listening and following I bought this and Fetch. I love her way of story telling, I love her illustrations/comics (I can't draw people at all, but Nicole's people seem so real!) Really happy that someone like Nicole can share her personal life stories with us and they can speak to us so loudly and we can find comfort in them.",

Themen wie Verlassen werden, Coming Out und Ablehnung auf Grund von Religion werden sehr emotional in Bildern gezeigt. Teilweise hat die Autorin einen kindlicheren Stil gew\u00e4hlt. Dies erfolgte, so weit ich das beurteilen kann, absichtlich und zwar an Stellen an denen der Hauptperson etwas peinlich ist. Sehr gelungen! Wer \"Fun Home\" genie\u00dfen konnte, f\u00fcr den ist dieses Werk ein hei\u00dfer Tipp!",

I loved the visual subtext in her drawings. As I went along I kept thinking of people I wanted to recommend it to. The familiarity of \"mom theatre\" from my own childhood cracked me up! The physical size of the book made it kind of a cumbersome bedtime read, but going through it on the couch or at a cafe, no problem.",
