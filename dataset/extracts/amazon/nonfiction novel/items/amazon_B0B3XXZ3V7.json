                "reviewText": "Enoch is not part of the Bible. In fact, much of what is in it does not match what is in the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament. It is filled with superstitious ideas. I Enoch was composed sometime around 200 BCE. The third century was a period of enormous distress for Jews, and the masses, unable to help themselves, sought an explanation for the evil around them and prayed for supernatural aid. Enoch was not unique in differing from mainstream Judaism. The writings of the times did not generally reflect mainstream Jewish thinking and contained many borrowed terms from non-Jewish sources.I Enoch, for example, is the first book that interprets Genesis 6 as a description of fallen angels. It describes a group of angels who descend to earth because of a sexual lust for earthly women. They defile their pure heavenly essence by joining with the women and having children who are giants. They teach their wives and children knowledge that humans should not have, such as the ability to write and the process of performing abortions. Their children befoul the earth and lead to the flood in the days of Noah.",

                "reviewText": "I like the dimensions and quality of the book. How ever the cover looks like a scaled up jpg, all detail is lost. The formatting of the text is horrible, they barely put effort in. It is most likely copied of one of the multiple websites it is available on and pasted into a publishing program, which I don\u2019t mind, I bought it because I don\u2019t like reading from websites and I\u2019d rather have a physical book, but I would have liked to at least get as much information and some decent editing. For example: chapter titles that are on the bottom of the page and the chapter starting on the next page.Also there are no page numbers.Index also has no page numbers.The font is way to big.They did not include all the references and notes R. H. Charles included.",
