Well, he hit it out of the park. The graphic novel of \"Bomb\" pulls the reader into the exciting and real history of the development of the atomic bomb during WWII. A complex story is told in vivid graphic format and with deceiving simplicity. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I've been wanting to pick up Sheinkin's original narrative nonfiction book, Bomb, for quite some time. I'm glad I was able to learn the story through graphic novel format, and I know this will reach a whole new audience of readers. This book took a very complex topic and presented it in a way that summarized while still detailing.The story is told in alternating perspectives of spy interrogation in the 1950s while flashing back to the creation of atomic bombs throughout 1940s. There was incredibly intense material, including the dropping of the bombs in Japan, but everything was shared in an age appropriate way. This would be a great way to introduce students to the basics of the a-bomb's history and the beginnings of the Cold War and Arms Race. I'm interested in now trying the chapter book to see what more information was included.",

He is able to write narrative nonfiction in a way that is so compelling and interesting and I am always eager to learn more about history in his well-written books. With the Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer movie coming out this year, I think that conversations about what really happened at Los Alamos will be in the zeitgeist again, and I'm excited to have this book to share with young readers.I also like the graphic novel approach here -- I think this serves as a good introduction point to the longer narrative nonfiction books and, in my opinion, the tone of the graphic panels matches the text perfectly. I am sure I'll be recommending this book often throughout the coming year!",
