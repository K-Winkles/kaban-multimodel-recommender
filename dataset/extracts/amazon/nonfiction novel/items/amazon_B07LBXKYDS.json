                "reviewText": "\u201cI will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone,\u201d (Dickens 144) the once miserly, old Scrooge pledges desperately to the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come as they stand over Scrooge\u2019s future grave, following their witnessing of the nightmarish images of his own forthcoming death and its pitiable consequences. Charles Dickens\u2019 charming and clever classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart has touched a countless number of people over generations. This five-star novel\u2019s utterly moving message and immense genius will touch many more to come, and urge others to make the pledge to \u201chonor Christmas in [their own hearts], and try to keep it all the year,\u201d (Dickens 144), as Scrooge so thoroughly did himself that one Christmas night.Originally published in the year of 1843, A Christmas Carol summons us to Victorian London, contemporary to the year the story was published. The selfish, stingy, miserly, and miserable, old Ebenezer Scrooge broods in his hatred for the Christmas Season, as Scrooge greatly detests happiness, generosity, love, and family. Christmas Eve night, he is haunted by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who appears to Scrooge with a long, heavy chain made from all of the terrible things that Marley pursued in life. Marley warns Scrooge that he is doomed to Marley\u2019s same, terrible fate unless he changes the way he lives his life. So he tells Scrooge that three more Spirits will haunt him during the course of the night. We all know the story: the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present, and Yet To Come visit Scrooge and show him moments in his lifetime in order to instill in Scrooge the idea to stop being so dreadful and instead to become compassionate. Throughout Scrooge\u2019s tale, Charles Dickens introduces to us three different methods (one for each of the three spirits) as the tools for a person, such as Scrooge, to change one\u2019s life. A very prominent theme portrayed in A Christmas Carol, is how the application of these three methods will change someone\u2019s heart.The Ghost of Christmas Past is the first of the three to appear to Scrooge and the first to apply one of Dickens\u2019 methods to change Scrooge\u2019s heart. The Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back to his childhood and early years to show him all of the people he has loved. He sees his beloved, younger sister, Fan, the mother of his ever-encouraging nephew, Fred; he sees the jolly man to whom he was once apprenticed, Fezziwig, and the jovial love he showed to all his family and friends; and Scrooge also sees his former fianc\u00e9e, reliving not only the scene of when she left him due to his growing greed, but also the images of the happy life she led after she left him. Seeing these people in his past renews Scrooge\u2019s spark of love for his family and friends. Dickens\u2019 first step to a change of heart\u2014 love.The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present succeeds the Ghost of Christmas Past and leads Scrooge through the existing world to see all those who were currently celebrating Christmas. He shows Scrooge the Cratchits, the family of Scrooge\u2019s clerk Bob Cratchit, demonstrating to Scrooge how his habit of penny-pinching and ill behavior toward Bob Cratchit is affecting the poor, struggling family, in particular Bob Cratchit\u2019s crippled son, Tiny Tim. This helps Scrooge feel regret for the decisions he has made and become more generous to those in need. The second method to the changing of Scrooge\u2019s heart was the feeling of regret.Then the wraithlike Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appears to Scrooge and shows him scenes from the future. At first, these scenes meant nothing to Scrooge as he saw the people of London\u2019s disgraceful response to a terrible man\u2019s death until Scrooge realized that this terrible man was Scrooge himself. This sudden realization at the setting of Scrooge\u2019s own future grave was the sign of his complete conversion to kindheartedness. He felt absolute fear of the images he saw, and wanted nothing more than to reverse them. Hence, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come applied the final method of transformation\u2014 fear for the future\u2019s terrible consequences.So there are the keys to Scrooge\u2019s conversion\u2014 love, regret, and fear for the future. The theme of how the application of these three methods is the key to changing someone\u2019s frame of mind I believe is both valid and properly conveyed. With the help of the three spirits that fateful, Christmas Eve night, Ebenezer Scrooge realized that he must always have, \u201cthe Spirits of all Three\u2026 strive within [him, and] not shut out the lessons that they teach,\u201d because if he went back to not loving, not feeling regret and guilt, and not being wary or fearful of future consequences, Scrooge would return to the greedy, wicked state in which he had found himself the night before. But that theme isn\u2019t the most prominent in Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol. The most prominent theme is the happiness one feels when one shows more benevolence, and I think that Dickens displayed this intent more than thoroughly by the end of his tale. And how true that is. Scrooge would\u2019ve gone on living his rotten life with no lasting legacy when he died if it were not for the spirits\u2019 visits. Instead, he spent the rest of his years becoming \u201cas good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world,\u201d (Dickens 158).In Charles Dickens\u2019 flawlessly written tale of A Christmas Carol, Scrooge learns that happiness can come to us if we will forget self and worldly gain, concentrating instead on helping others and learning to embrace the love of family and friends. Dickens\u2019 clear, concise, and beautiful depiction of the world\u2019s most beloved Christmas story second only to Christmas\u2019 inspiration is one that everyone would benefit from reading. And may those who read it, remember themselves to \u201chonor Christmas in [their hearts], and try to keep it all the year,\u201d (Dickens 144).",
