            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cI started Numb to This right before the shootings at the grocery store in Buffalo. I finished it the day before the shootings at the elementary school in Texas. Kindra Neely\u2019s graphic memoir reminds us that mass shootings leave far more victims than just the people who end up in caskets. This searing, raw, and honest account offers a window to those who want to empathize, and a mirror for those of us who may find ourselves in her shoes.\u201d\u2015April Henry, New York Times bestselling author of Girl, Stolen*\"Via realistic dialogue, tense relationship dynamics, and turbulent emotional highs and lows, Neely astutely asserts the importance of hopeful defiance in the face of the numbness and resignation that often accompanies feelings of powerlessness.\"\u2015Publishers Weekly, starred review About the Author Kindra Neely is an artist and writer based in southern Oregon. Her art journey began with the amazing community and encouragement she received at Umpqua Community College. She took her first drawing class Drawing Nature at UCC and still likes to hike the trails regularly to sketch flowers and ferns. Numb to This is her debut graphic novel."

        "description": "This searing graphic memoir portrays the impact of gun violence through a fresh lens with urgency, humanity, and a very personal hope. Kindra Neely never expected it to happen to her. No one does. Sure, she\u2019d sometimes been close to gun violence, like when the house down the street from her childhood home in Texas was targeted in a drive-by shooting. But now she lived in Oregon, where she spent her time swimming in rivers with friends or attending classes at the bucolic Umpqua Community College. And then, one day, it happend: a mass shooting shattered her college campus. Over the span of a few minutes, on October 1, 2015, eight students and a professor lost their lives. And suddenly, Kindra became a survivor. This empathetic and ultimately hopeful graphic memoir recounts Kindra\u2019s journey forward from those few minutes that changed everything. It wasn\u2019t easy. Every time Kindra took a step toward peace and wholeness, a new mass shooting devastated her again. Las Vegas. Parkland. She was hopeless at times, feeling as if no one was listening. Not even at the worldwide demonstration March for Our Lives. But finally, Kindra learned that\u2014for her\u2014the path toward hope wound through art, helping others, and sharing her story.",

As Kindra relates the shooting on her school campus, she hears the gunshots but is several buildings away from the incident. Still, she shows how even that limited exposure left her struggling to cope for years. I\u2019m glad I learned that truth from this book.In many places the book presents a kind of collage of images without dialogue or narration. I sometimes had difficulty understanding what these images were intended to communicate, which was frustrating. Also, the narration at times felt heavy-handed.Despite its shortcomings, the book did move me, especially the scenes at the March for Our Lives. I\u2019m glad that Kindra is in recovery. I recommend this book to all sensitive, thinking people.",

Her experience mirrored mine in many ways and explained things that I could not put into words myself. Every new shooting on the news I'd a retrauma: it comes with nightmares, panic attacks, and constant checking of your surroundings. Many people suffer from depression. People kill themselves. This is very true. The victim number for shootings doesn't end with the event. It affects the community long afterwards, as families, friends, and victims try to piece their lives back together.",

                "reviewText": "There\u2019s a lovely tradition in the high school I work at where teachers to post the title of the book they\u2019re currently reading on their classroom door. I was puttering around last Friday, packing up before Winter Break, and I changed my sign over to show my latest read, Kindra Neely\u2019s graphic novel Numb to This: Memoir of a Mass Shooting. A student who has struggled in my class asked me about it, and then wanted to see the book, and then asked when is it gonna be on the bookshelf? I was reading a library copy, but you can bet I placed an order for this one as soon as I had a spare moment. In my opinion, there\u2019s nothing better than finding a book (the right one, the one they choose!) for that student who needs it. And on top of that, this book is a must-read \u2013 an important, shattering story from a gun violence survivor \u2013 a chance to listen to someone share what that aftermath looks and feels like.Kindra Neely survived the Umpqua Community College mass shooting in Oregon in 2015, and her beautiful, poignant, and searing memoir of the years after is absolutely required reading. There\u2019s some background and context-setting, but the majority of Neely\u2019s book focuses on the day of the shooting and what happened next: how she reacted in the short- and long-term, the impact of PTSD on her life, and the reality of a suicide attempt: all while presenting a front to the world. In the 300 pages of this debut graphic novel, Neely lays herself bare for a purpose, saying \u201cI\u2026went looking for a book about how to deal with the aftermath of a shooting, but I couldn\u2019t find one. Maybe I could make a book to show people like me that they aren\u2019t alone, or that their feelings are normal.\u201dNeely\u2019s story is not just one of trauma, though it does deal with that. It keeps the tension between hope (she survived, she keeps surviving, she finds meaning in making art & helping others) and realism (there are bad days full of fear, depression is very real, and some people are uncomfortable around those who are open about their trauma). The pacing and scene changes are also telegraphed well and keep the \u201cjourney\u201d of Neely\u2019s life (narrative) moving. It is also heartwarming to see the real-life friends come alongside Neely in tough moments, and vice versa, even though no one is without flaws (except maybe Neely\u2019s mom). The supportive, healthy relationships and networks from her life are excellent guides for young readers to follow, internalize, and model in their own lives.Pacing and storytelling in the graphic novel format rely so much on the art\u2026 and I just want to say that Neely\u2019s art is fabulous. I would have no idea that this was a debut \u2013 her style and linework are polished, modern, and evocative. The emotion bleeds through the pages, and while this volume is in full color, I think Neely\u2019s neat linework and focus on facial expressions would work in any color palette. There\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be a predominant or overarching color theme, but teals and purples show up quite a bit in scenes set in Oregon, and harsh yellows and reds during moments of stress and trauma. Overt symbolism of dragonflies appears throughout (and is explained directly in the text).Overall, Neely\u2019s story and art are indistinguishable/inseparable \u2013 and the result, a compulsively-readable volume, allows her to be vulnerable in the service of helping others. Numb to This is heart-wrenching and incisive and belongs in every high school library in the country.Recommended for: high school nonfiction collections, and anyone ages 14+ who has been touched by a mass shooting in some way (at this point, everyone in the US).",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this graphic memoir of what it is like to deal with the tragedy of being in a mass shooting and the fear and uncertainty and ptsd that comes with it.Neely explores how she worked through it on her own and found a way out in her creative output. It's also a cry that we should put fewer people through the ordeal that she went through.The thing that really struck me when I was reading it - not the tragedy, or the personal story, or the remembrance of all the people we've lost - what struck me was that I cannot for the life of me remember the coverage or the event that is central to this text.We have had so many of these shootings that it's not just her, but we have all become \"Numb to this\".",
