                "reviewText": "I love K.M. Weiland\u2019s blog, Helping Writers Become Authors, with its helpful articles on the craft of fiction. I also loved her book, Dreamlander. So it\u2019s reasonable that I would buy her Outlining Your Novel Workbook: Step-by-Step Exercises for Planning Your Best Book, the companion to her manual, Outlining Your Novel: Map Your Way to Success.I am a person who gets into trouble when I try to write by the seat of my pants. I really need to plan out my story pretty much from beginning to end\u2014not that I won\u2019t follow any brilliant idea that comes to me spontaneously, but just so that my plot doesn\u2019t die from the dreaded lack of destination. Without an outline, my characters just wander around aimlessly until they hit a dead end.In the past, I\u2019ve used The Writer\u2019s Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters by Christopher Vogler with its archtypes and twelve stages to outline my novels, but it\u2019s only taken me so far.Since NaNoWriMo of November 2014, I\u2019ve been struggling to get my (hopefully) first publishable novel, The Unicornologist, into shape. It was missing something, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what. I decided to take it through the steps in Weiland\u2019s book after the fact to figure out where the holes in the manuscript were. She suggests exercises that help you brainstorm in specific ways. For example:Ask yourself every \u201cwhat if\u201d question that pops to mind regarding your story. Some of your ideas will be ridiculous; most will probably never make it into your book. But don\u2019t censor yourself. By allowing yourself to write down every idea, no matter how crazy, you may come up with story-transforming gems.Weiland uses illustrations from her own books and others\u2019 to explain what makes plot compelling. She asks questions that make you dig deeper into your characters:\u0490 What Lie does your character believe that is keeping him from the Thing He Needs while prompting him to believe he must gain the Thing He Wants?\u0490 How can your protagonist demonstrate determination?\u0490 How can your protagonist show kindness to others?I have used questionnaires to build dossiers on my characters, but I don\u2019t really like questionnaires, because so many of the questions seem immaterial to my story. (My main character\u2019s favorite color really doesn\u2019t come into play in my mystical fantasy.) Weiland includes \u201cinterview\u201d questions, and many of them don\u2019t help me. However, the questions like the ones quoted above make me think about the characters\u2019 personalities and visualize their actions and help me figure out how to portray them.Weiland has authors focus on six important aspects of their novels: premise, scenes, character backstories and interviews, setting (including world building, if necessary), story elements, and structure.Every writer has to find his own approach to outlining (or else do without, as Stephen King and many other successful storytellers have). Rather than reinvent the wheel, as it were, most of us try out multiple approaches and keep the aspects that work for our projects. Reading through Outlining Your Novel Workbook in tandem with revising my work-in-progress did help me find holes in my story, and add detail and emotional impact to my scenes. I will use many parts of it for outlining my future stories, but I will probably skip over the parts that don\u2019t apply to my story or resonate with me.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a fan of KM's writing advice; she is always very insightful on the art of storytelling. I've always been a hybrid \"pantser\" (I make up the story by the seat of my pants) and planner (I know where the story is going). I usually know points A, M, and Z in a story, and sometimes I know the set pieces that occur at G and T. How do I get to those points? That's where the pantsing comes in.To the pantsers, don't be afraid of this book. She includes details in here about worldbuilding, which is something you do want to plan. It's nice to not have to get out of the zone in order to work out details about your world, like how the magic works or whether or not certain innovations existed in the time period you're writing about. Plus, I find that research adds to the plotting, sending me off in new directions. If you use Scrivener (highly recommended), get over to KM's site and grab her Scrivener template, which includes Patricia Wrede's worldbuilding \"questions to think about.\" She links to Wrede in this book, in case you don't have Scrivener.One more thing to the pantsers -- I often start writing, (Point A to G) then start loosely outlining how I'm getting from G to M. Often this is the part where I work out character motivations and what their arcs will be, now that I've gotten to know them a bit. Weiland addresses the characters in this workbook, too. When I'm finished with the story, I like to use outlining as a way of working out the pacing or figuring out if I've dropped a thread I need to tie off. Don't think of outlining as a straitjacket; this workbook is designed to aid creativity, not suppress it.",

I\u2019ve encountered nothing in this workbook that makes it essential or even all that helpful in terms of fleshing out my story/novel concepts or plot beats. It just kind of is. I worked through a few early pages with fidelity in hopes that I would find it more helpful than I was guessing it would be when I first received it and actually got to look at it, but it was just basic stuff that I had already long figured out on my writing journey. Conversations with trusted writers and friends have been infinitely more helpful to my process, and they didn\u2019t cost a dime. It\u2019s not a bad workbook per se, but I don\u2019t know how this would be of use to someone who knows anything about writing already going into their process of writing.",

We have a wide variety of writers and genres at different levels. Each attendee gained many idea's and understanding to take away from this book and the opportunity to use the work book was invaluable. This book also reinforced what we have been teaching for over six years now at the RWR Rainforest Writing Retreat in Australia, and writer now have an excellent resource to revisit if they ever get stuck. I do have to say, I love the 'Ask the Authors' section and checklists at the end of each chapter. I highly recommend this tool for the aspiring writer.",

Eu estava escrevendo um livro sem qualquer direcionamento e o Outlining simplificou o processo, fazendo escrever um resumo do que acontece em cada cap\u00edtulo at\u00e9 o fim da est\u00f3ria, o que n\u00e3o me prende ao que escrevi nos resumos, mas me ajudou a mapear todo o caminho a percorrer. Acho que fica mais f\u00e1cil quando se sabe onde vai. Recomendo a quem gosta de escrever!",
