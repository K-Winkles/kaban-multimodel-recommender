Today, graphic novels are becoming more and more popular with kids and I thought this would be better for her instead of the classical book because she loves art and manga. I was skeptical because I never want to disrespect or lighten certain subjects because this is history and it\u2019s important. I am happy that this gives young people a new way to read Anne Frank\u2019s story as well as learn about the Holocaust in terms they can understand.",

They take the more sensitive adult stuff out of context and even misunderstand Anne's more intimate thoughts and those thoughts' portrayal in this book. (For example, she wasn't \"a lesbian\"- she was mostly straight, as the book's discussion of past people she loved or had crushes on shows.) The artwork beautifully illustrated Anne's thoughts and feelings and ideas on a variety of topics, including the one about the \"two Annes\", a look at Anne's story \"Cady's Life\", and that time they had to eat endive all the time.I admit I was disappointed not to see the \"S.P.V. (if you please) gas\" sign on the toilet door or van Pels (van Daan)'s stork joke in there, though.But overall, well done! (Recommended for age 12-13 and up.)",

                "reviewText": "For the first time i received a book with a fresh smell of print. The book has a total of 149+2=151pgs.(Incl. the last page which has the image of Anne frank walking away). Due to recent floods, between 03.Dec.23 & 06.Dec.23, i could not move out of my house. It was very much uncomfortable for me to be confined within my house just for 3days,whereas this girl's whole family had been living in confinement for about 2yrs.I cannot even image the level of misery the family would have gone through all because of Hitler.Just because they were born jewish,the family lived a miserable life.I thought the genocide of Srilankan Tamils in 2009 was an inhumane act,but this is much worse than that.The innocent civilians of Srilanka were atleast killed at once,whereas many Jewish families went through unbearable suffering for many days. The graphic artist brings those scenes right in front of us.After p.24,the depiction is so immersive that, it feels like we are being a mute spectator of that family.This book shows how dark the human mind can be (like Hitler) but at the same time the grit of another human mind (like Anne Frank) for a better tomorrow.",
