All thoughts and opinions are my own.The Incredible Nellie Bly is a fantastic graphic biography of the infamous investigative journalist that made waves by infiltrating a women's insane asylum and traveled around the world in less than 80 days, alone!This fashionably designed graphic novel highlights Bly's groundbreaking investigations and how she opened the door for future female journalists (some of which share a cameo spread at the end of the book) as well as how she persevered despite the limitations set on women in that time period.I found this to be quite fascinating with fantastic illustrations with era-appropriate clothing that take us right into the past, including Bly's 'around the world' travel outfit!",

                "reviewText": "A book about women and journalism would not be complete without Nellie Bly, so this tale of her adventures may be a good read for young people. The graphic novel will make it more approachable for some, but I'm wondering if there are many would-be journalists who need to read a graphic novel? Probably this is for a wider audience. The images help us get to know about clothing, items on sale and relative wealth of people.The foreword tells us about Nellie's life but after that, we follow a young woman during the 20th century who fictionally meets Nellie for an interview, before we finally get to know the journalist, traveller and women's suffrage campaigner. I'm not delighted by this early character as it feels like padding and an attempt to add original content. I would not pick up a book about a major personage in order to read about a person who wanted to interview that personage; so while this girl is supposed to take the part of the keen young reader, I think the keen young reader can get quite enough details to get to know investigative journalist Nellie for themselves. I read this e-ARC from Net Galley and Fresh Fiction. This is an unbiased review.",
