        "description": "Zen in the Art of Archery, a classic text on Eastern philosophy, is a beautiful and immensely informative narrative of one man's Zen experience. Eugen Herrigel, a German philosopher in Tokyo, began studying archery as a means of better comprehending Zen Buddhism. This is the story of how he overcame his first inhibitions and began to feel his way toward new realities and ways of seeing throughout his six years as a student of one of Japan's great kyudo (archery) masters.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars revelatory for the musician",
                "reviewText": "I know this book has been on the recommended reading lists of most musicians for a long time, but I finally undertook to read it this year. It happened to be at a time when I was about to start a run of a Rossini opera, which is a very particular musical style requiring the players to play on the front of the beat with extremely precise articulation and unity (musicians are called upon to be able to control their timing by as little as one millisecond), and hold their focus for the duration of nearly three hours. This can sometimes lead to a lot of physical tension, exhaustion, and mistakes, or result in a less enthusiastic performance from the group as the task seems insurmountable. Learning from this book the technique of setting up your shot and it \"happens\" at the right time, I was able to shift my focus forward to setting up each note and \"letting it happen\" at the right time on the front of the beat. For thousands and thousands of short notes that each had to be (in theory, at least) precisely placed over the numerous performances, I found the sum of all my training and 35 year performing career comes down to putting it all on THIS eighth note, setting it up to do its part in telling the story. When I dedicated myself to it, I found I could hear a lot more of what my colleagues were playing, and be much more reliable to them, and I felt relaxed and free from worry. Large-scale performances are a pretty cool exercise in group dynamics, and there is a delightful synergy in dozens of people coming together to tell a story. Different than, but remarkably like, practitioners of kyudo coming in from all different careers and walks in life, and reaching new heights of personal achievement through an ancient form of archery.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Universal Tale",
                "reviewText": "My martial arts instructor has many books that he allows his students to take out. Some of them he recommends, others he recommends quite strongly. ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY, however, is the only book which he actually handed out to every member of the advanced class. Clearly there is something he wants us to know.The book revolves around Herrigel's attempt to understand Zen through the practice of kyudo (Japanese archery). Although I am no expert in either Zen or kyudo, I think he does a pretty good job. The concepts that Herrigel communicates to the reader are extremely esoteric and I found them easy to grasp through this slim volume. However, reading the book solely as a story about one person's search for Zen is to read the book far too narrowly.The concepts that Herrigel addresses are universal concepts. They are not strictly religious (Zen), martial (kyudo) or even Asian (Japanese). Any substantial activity, be it learning kyudo, becoming a chess grandmaster or practicing to become a classical pianist, requires one to reach beyond psychological and internal barriers. This is what should be taken from this book.During Herrigel's study, he focused not on the target, but on himself as the archer. The struggle was both an internal one, including physical aspects such as breathing properly and relaxing, as well as a refocusing of his mind, such as NOT focusing on the ultimate destination of the arrows he was shooting. The transcendence was within Herrigel himself.This lesson is applicable to numerous situations across cultures and across activities. ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY provides a good example of this phenomenon but not the only possible example. Read more broadly, this book provides anyone undertaking a long and arduous activity a simple framework for reaching beyond those plateaus that we all frustratingly find ourselves on from time to time. I recommend it on that basis.",
