Our kids loved this book too- the imagery and word painting, darling characters, and relatable experiences were engaging. We ended up using this for a homeschool unit- Language Arts.

                "reviewText": "This story is told from the perspective of a tree. There's inherent wisdom and patience that comes from being a tree, and now, we get to hang out with one for a few hundred pages. Our tree houses many neighborhood animals, all diverse yet similar. The neighborhood that our friend calls home is also very diverse and we get to watch what happens when a tree helps two kiddos become friends despite their different backgrounds. This story is for younger readers, and yes a tree that talks is make believe, but it's about real life. Get a copy, read it and then share it with your friends.Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the book:\"Hollows offer protection from the elements. A secure spot to sleep and to stash your belongings. They're a safe place. Hollows are proof that something bad can become something good with enough time and care and hope\" p. 5\"... Sometimes things happen that aren't so good. When they occur, I've learned that there's not much you can do except stand tall and reach deep.\" P. 35\"Real life, like a good garden, is messy.\" p. 209This book is going to be very popular. It was published in September of this year and has already topped some major book lists. It's beautiful. Not just pretty to look at, which it is, but so sweet. I hugged the book when I finished, which isn't something I never do, but it's reserved for a special category of book.",

                "reviewText": "Katherine Applegate\u2019s book, Wishtree was a great book for mature 3rd graders to 6th graders. The beginning and middle were excellent, but the end was very unexpected.Whether it was the ancient tree, Red, describing the sunny days or switching back and forth between 120 years ago and now, I liked how Applegate used the tree\u2019s point of view rather than a person\u2019s point of view. The tree saw everything that happened in the neighborhood, and the people only saw about one-third of what happened in the neighborhood because they were in their houses.The ending, however, was unexpected because someone did something that she could have done anywhere else in the entire book. Katherine Applegate could have made the animals or the people do something that they only could have done in the end.In all, the book was great, but it would have been WAY better if there was at least a decent ending.",

Ich dachte nach der Vorstellung erst, es sei ein Kinderbuch (was ich mag), es ist aber sowohl f\u00fcr Kinder als auch f\u00fcr Erwachsene, die genauer hinschauen und denen in der Form einfache Geschichten (nicht im Inhalt) nicht \"zu bl\u00f6d\" sind. Ich mag das Buch sehr, besonders, weil es ein einfaches Englisch hat, das leicht verst\u00e4ndlich ist, wenn man einigermassen Englisch kann. Uneingeschr\u00e4nkt zu empfehlen!",
