        "description": "We use water, electricity, and the internet every day--but how do they actually work? And what\u2019s the plan to keep them running for years to come? This nonfiction science graphic novel takes readers on a journey from how the most essential systems were developed to how they are implemented in our world today and how they will be used in the future.What was the first message sent over the internet? How much water does a single person use every day? How was the electric light invented?For every utility we use each day, there\u2019s a hidden history--a story of intrigue, drama, humor, and inequity. This graphic novel provides a guided tour through the science of the past--and reveals how the decisions people made while inventing and constructing early technology still affect the way people use it today.Full of art, maps, and diagrams, Hidden Systems is a thoughtful, humorous exploration of the history of science and what needs to be done now to change the future.

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent summary of the large systems that support modern life. Its descriptions of the internet and electric power systems are clear and easy for non-STEM readers to understand.The description of modern water system is less robust; largely ignoring sewage treatment by cities, pollution control efforts of industry and the success of regulators in both Europe and North America improving the water quality of lakes and rivers.There is some moralizing but its easy to skip over. Colonialism (circa 1880-1960) is blamed for 2023 water shortages, internet routing and poor electrical grids in the developing world. Monopolistic utilities and not their diligent overseers, the state power regulators, are blamed for all grid failures and the resulting wild fires.I recommend this quick read for those interested in a 30K foot oversight of these systems.",

It\u2019s smart while remaining humble, entertaining while remaining educational, and artistic while remaining accurate. It could be the most relevant book I have ever found for the widest audience. Dan breaks down complexities in ways everyone can understand and in a manner that most will want to read. Extremely well done, Dan. You should be proud of Hidden Systems - it\u2019s brilliant!",

                "reviewText": "\"Hidden Systems\" is an attractive, informative book about things we take for granted: electricity, water coming out of a tap, the internet. Nott is careful to keep things realistic. For example, \"cloud computing\" doesn't take place in a cloud. The \"cloud\" is a server farm, which uses a lot of electricity. Another example is how our use of water fits into the planet's hydrological cycle. We use all these systems, but the systems themselves are mostly hidden from us.Nott also covers some of the questions that we may have about these systems. Important questions include our choices for our electric power supply and whether some of our water use hurts people that live downstream. Depending on your politics, you may or may not like these parts of the book. On the other hand, there is an engineering aphorism that \"there are no solutions: there are only tradeoffs.\" A young person reading this book will learn about how our hidden systems operate. She will also learn about tradeoffs and the questions that still remain to be answered.",
