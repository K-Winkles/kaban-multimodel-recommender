            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201c[I] loved it so so much. So poignant, honest, funny, powerful, and timely, and its themes build in a way that by the end is truly artistically transcendent.\u201d\u2014Curtis Sittenfeld, New York Times bestselling author of Prep and Eligible\u201cAmong its many virtues, Mira Jacob\u2019s graphic memoir, Good Talk, helps us think through this term [\u2018person of color\u2019] with grace and disarming wit. The book lives up to its title, and reading these searching, often hilarious t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates is as effortless as eavesdropping on a crosstown bus. . . . The medium is part of the magic. . . . The old comic-book alchemy of words and pictures opens up new possibilities of feeling. . . . The people are black and white\u2014except, of course, they\u2019re not.\u201d\u2014Ed Park, The New York Times Book Review\u201cGood Talk addresses head-on the complexities of being fully American while also being fully Jewish, fully Indian, fully mixed, fully whatever in the era of Trump. . . . Good Talk attempts to answer, with humor and heart, some of the most difficult questions of all.\u201d\u2014Bustle\u201c[A] showstopping memoir about race in America . . . by turns funny, philosophical, cautious, and heartbreaking . . . Particularly moving are the chapters in which Jacob explores how even those close to her retain closed-minded and culturally defined prejudices. . . . The memoir works well visually, with striking pen-and-ink drawings . . . collaged onto vibrant found photographs and illustrated backgrounds. . . . Told with immense bravery and candor, this book will make readers hunger for more of Jacob\u2019s wisdom and light.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\u201cBreezy but poignant . . . [Mira Jacob] employs pages of narrative prose sparingly but hauntingly. . . . The \u2018talks\u2019 Jacob relates are painful, often hilarious, and sometimes absurd, but her memoir makes a fierce case for continuing to have them.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)\u201cA beautiful and eye-opening account of what it means to mother a brown boy and what it means to live in this country post\u20139/11, as a person of color, as a woman, as an artist . . . In Jacob\u2019s brilliant hands, we are gifted with a narrative that is sometimes hysterically funny, always honest, and ultimately healing.\u201d\u2014Jacqueline Woodson, National Book Award\u2013winning author of Another Brooklyn \u201cGood Talk begins with a child\u2019s innocent questions about race and evolves into an honest, direct, and heartbreakingly funny journey. As a brown-skinned woman married to a Jewish man and the mother of a biracial child, I experienced this book on multiple levels: It broke my heart and made me laugh a helluva lot, but, in the end, it also forced me to ponder whether I have successfully provided the answers necessary to arm my own children against racism in America.\u201d\u2014Lynn Nottage, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning playwright of Sweat About the Author Mira Jacob is the author of the critically acclaimed novel The Sleepwalker\u2019s Guide to Dancing. Her recent work has appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Vogue, Glamour, Tin House, Electric Literature and Literary Hub. She lives in Brooklyn."

At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she\u2019s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation\u2014and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions.LONGLISTED FOR THE PEN/OPEN BOOK AWARD \u201cJacob\u2019s earnest recollections are often heartbreaking, but also infused with levity and humor. What stands out most is the fierce compassion with which she parses the complexities of family and love.\u201d\u2014Time\u201cGood Talk uses a masterful mix of pictures and words to speak on life\u2019s most uncomfortable conversations.\u201d\u2014io9\u201cMira Jacob just made me toss everything I thought was possible in a book-as-art-object into the garbage.

It is a glimpse into the experiences of a woman of color and how those experiences felt in her body and her mind and how they shape how she experiences her life. As a white woman, this book gave me another glimpse into a world that is easy for me to not see, to not understand, to not connect to, and to not change. But in order to let go of all the interlocking systems of oppression that are the backbone of white American culture, we all have to continue to learn, unlearn, and embrace the discomfort. It starts with me and with books like this so that we can become the diverse country we pretend we are.",

There's definitely a range of rage, sadness, hopelessness, and the cycle begins again. This book is definitely a conversation starter because it covers a range of topics anti-blackness, colorism, racism, sexism, microagressions, white privilege to name a few.",

Born and raised in the U.S. she then married a white Jewish man with whom she had a mix-raced son. The book focuses on the dichotomy of those two cultures and on the election of Donald Trump, in 2016, and how that affected her view, while also focusing on the big questions her son was asking about politics and about being a brown kid in North America.With these conversations she discusses about so many themes with such a subtlety and grace, giving the reader these complex issues to talk about. There is also humour between the serious discussions. The book captures the voices of generations of different people living in these uncertain times. I love this book immensely and will highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Mira Jacob has done most of the work for you in this book. Her use of the graphic novel format expertly crams massive ideas into vignettes of just a few pages, sometimes even less, without sacrificing their complexity or weight. The framework of family interactions provides a relatable, emotional context for the discussion of racism and colorism in the US, and I was particularly moved by the interactions with her son that form the major outline of the story. His observations and questions provide as much humor as heartbreak, but provoke important discussions we should all be engaged in. Overall a very fun and contemplative read, and her unapologetic bisexual representation was fantastic to see as well.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed reading this memoir! This was my first time reading a graphic novel, so I was a little apprehensive whether I would enjoy this medium. The author really has done a great job with this memoir! It's a honest and seemingly effortless presentation of life as lived by the author - the joys, the blunders, discomforts, uneasiness and the contradictions that the author has lived through as an American of Indian origin married to a Jew and raising this precious kid!If you are raising or are going to raise inter-racial children, like me, this might be especially interesting to you. Thank you for writing this Mira! I am an Indian married to an American Jew too and I often wonder about raising our kids there. Sometimes it feels daunting to even think about it - I know their lives growing up in the US will be too unfamiliar and hard for me to understand/connect with. I worry that I might not have the answers for them or be able to be the 'parent' or adult because I didn't grow up there and don't have the cultural capital to help them navigate their lives. But I guess parenting is about learning, growing and figuring stuff out with your child, like you have been doing. That there's a lot of it to be done whether or not you grow up in the same country as them. Besides, there's my husband!",

Thanks for sharing this uniquely created book. I enjoyed reading it so much that I forgot everything around me. I had a great time with it.",
