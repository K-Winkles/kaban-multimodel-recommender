                "reviewText": "Ernest Holmes, founder of the Church of Religious Science, wrote this epic book as a \"textbook\" for those interested in a practical approach to metaphysical and New Thought ideals. I was first introduced to many of the concepts back in 1994, when I read \"Creative Visualization\" by Shakti Gawain (another book I highly recommend), when I was going through a particularly dark period of my life, and seeking answers I could not find in traditional orthodox religion. While \"Creative Visualization\" was an adequate introduction, \"The Science of Mind\" really expands upon and explains these concepts more thoroughly. It is intimidating at 600+ pages, but once you get into it, you really don't think about it's length! Since I first acquired this book in 2007, I've read it 3 times straight through, and will read it again, I'm sure. Since I have applied these concepts to my own life, I've noticed definite improvements, and notice more every day! The underlying message that everything is One, and that we are all an integral part of the Divine Creative Principle is both comforting and empowering. \"It is done unto you as you believe\" is a truth for all ages. I really feel that Ernest Holmes was ahead of his time when he wrote this book, and the truths it contain transcend time - in fact, a lot of this is more relevant now than it was when it was originally written. I've long since collected every book by Ernest Holmes I can get my hands on, and I find all of his work very illuminating and spiritually liberating. His books always make me feel good about life, and give me the realization that I do, in fact, have control over my life. If you can get them, I also recommend the \"Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life\" 6 volume home study course in \"The Science of Mind\", which gives an even deeper understanding of the concepts explained in this book.On a sidenote, this is the 1938 revised and expanded volume of \"The Science of Mind\". The original 1926 version was shorter and, in my opinion, not as well organized as far as subject matter. I have tried to read it, but find this 1938 version much easier to navigate. However, the 1926 version does contain an entire section on psychic phenomena, which was intentionally omitted from the 1938 revision, as Ernest Holmes (according to his biography \"That Was Ernest\" by Reginald C. Armor) felt that much of it just couldn't be proven. Still, it is an interesting read for those interested in the field of psychic phenomena. There will shortly be a combined SOM volume available through Tarcher/Penguin which contains both versions, for those interested in reading both!",

                "reviewText": "\"Change your life by changing your mind\"....We have at our disposal all of the goodness, prosperity, love, health, and even wealth that exists in the world and we can access all of that by simply learning how the Universe (God,He, She, It or...) works in all of it's simple magnificence. No churches or middle-people to interpret or judge us and all we need is at our fingertips with this book and the others that Ernest Holmes gifted us with. I would recommend his \"Living the Science of Mind\" as a companion volume because initially the Metaphysics and this material can be pretty daunting at times even though it is written in a very accessible manner. If you don't push it, don't push yourself, or judge or allow yourself to be intimidated by past thoughts and experiences, especially those you may have had through family and/or organized forms of religion then you will sooner than later \"get it\", understand and be able to use the building blocks of the very reality we all live in. How could it not be a little overwhelming at first????? Read a little, let it sink in, give it the time you need and re-read then read some more and each time you will see it all with a little more clarity.Also be prepared to feel a need to doubt and reject it all because it seems just too easy, so whole and wholesome. No worries, put it down and come back when you are ready. This is when the companion volume becomes very helpful. Be ready to take the most exciting and fulfilling adventure of a lifetime and welcome to your life!",

This version does contain the updated forward by Jean Houston, Ph.D., and meditations in the back for further study, but for those who are willing to absorb its wisdom without \u201ctraining wheels\u201d, feel absolutely free to enjoy Ernest Holmes\u2019 wisdom straight from the hose, so to speak, as it contains all the original text. The fact that this book is nobody\u2019s required reading goes a long way toward understanding why so few succeed in their own right. Granted, there are more utilitarian copies of this book, and I recommend buying one so you can really break the binding and read it comfortably, but both as a source of wisdom, and a keepsake, this copy of The Science of Mind is golden \u2014 literally and figuratively.",

                "reviewText": "It is clear that Ernest Holmes was an Enlightened Being of the highest caliber. And I hate using the word 'Enlightened', this is probably the first instance I declare it warranted for no other word would, or could, quite cut it.I have read over 100 books on Spirituality: classic Christian texts, The Tao Te Ching, The Bhagavad Gita, The Dhammapada, The Kybalion and everything in between. Of the 250+ books I have that render my closet obsolete, this is HANDS DOWN the one I would keep if I could only keep one.Anyone who gives this book anything but an outstanding review is simply not ready to receive it, but the wisdom is timeless and profound and will prove itself true the second it is understood and applied.I have had PROFOUND experiences using Mushrooms and LSD with intention in the past. This book only confirms the 'downloads' I received from the universe or God and added more depth, understanding, and practicality to the knowledge. I recently did a 9 day Ayahuasca retreat in Peru and had profound and sacred visions. Once again, this book appears to be steps ahead of me and helped me to interpret and apply with utmost simplicity what I saw in the higher realms of Consciousness and Being.I was hesitant to buy this book due to the price, but my intuition was obsessive and relentless over this. The publisher of this book also had some of my other favorites in leather bound such as The Kybalion, Psycho Cybernetics, and Think and Grow Rich. This was the only leather-bound book I didn't recognize so I knew it had to be good. Eventually I caved and, in hindsight, I don't know how I would live without this. The Spirit definitely guided me to this when I was ready for it.The book itself is absolutely gorgeous with its leather binding and gold finish. This has absolutely become my Bible and I solemnly declare that I will read it until I die, and likely continue learning the truths of this message even after that. I even wrote this entire review and had it deleted when I tried to add pictures, but I feel so strongly that I had to retype it in case it might influence your decision to buy it.Praise God for this mighty work of revelation that has torn the veil that all who seek may find.",
