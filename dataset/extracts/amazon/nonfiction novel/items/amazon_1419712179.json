I loved how there was a balance between CeCe dealing with issues relating to her disability (ie. her hearing aids breaking, learning to lip read, etc.) and her dealing with issues that every kid might go through (ie. dealing with a friend who is too pushy, having a crush, etc.). Made the character very realistic and relatable. Great read for both kids and adults!",
