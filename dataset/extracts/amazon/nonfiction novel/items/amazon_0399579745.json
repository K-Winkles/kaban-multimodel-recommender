Jessica Brody takes the mystery and frustration out of plotting a novel. I\u2019ll never write another book without a copy of Save the Cat!

They're formed by studying the twists and turns of others' stories. Save the Cat! Writes a Novel is a perfect plot study tool for all levels of writer. It will help you dissect any plot conundrum, conceive your story's blueprint, and give a beat to every pivot of your hero's journey.\" --Grant Faulkner, executive director of National Novel Writing Month and author of Pep Talks for Writers: 52 Insights and Actions to Boost Your Creative Mojo \u201cThrough its insightful use of beat sheets, genres, and trade secrets, this book is an invaluable guide through the daunting task of writing a novel.\u201d --Jessica Khoury, author of The Forbidden Wish and Last of Her Name\u201cThis playful, illuminating book is a godsend for anyone seeking to understand story structure for novels.\u201d--Emmy Laybourne, author of the international bestselling Monument 14 trilogy, and the novels Sweet, Berserker and Ransacker About the Author JESSICA BRODY worked for MGM Studios as manager of acquisitions and business development before becoming an internationally best-selling author of more than fifteen novels for teens, tweens, and adults including The Geography of Lost Things, The Chaos of Standing Still, A Week of Mondays, and Better You Than Me.

She travels the country teaching Save the Cat! workshops to novelists. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. The Beginning . . . So, let\u2019s get this party started. We\u2019ve got a big journey ahead of us, and I, for one, am antsy to get moving.First things first. What do you need? At the very least, you need an idea for a novel. It doesn\u2019t have to be a huge idea. It can be a seed of an idea, it can be a twinkle of an idea. It can even be a character that interests you, or a collection of inspiring thoughts that you hope to somehow string together. Perhaps you\u2019ve got an idea but you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth writing. You don\u2019t know if it \u201chas legs\u201d as they say in the film industry. Can it go the distance? Can it really carry you through three hundred-plus pages of prose?Or you might already have a novel fully or partially written that\u2019s not working, that you know you have to revise. Or maybe you\u2019ve started a book and don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going and now you\u2019re stuck and in need of some inspiration.Regardless of your specific situation, I\u2019m excited to have you along for the journey. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what we\u2019ll be covering in the following chapters (the structure of this book on structure, if you will): 1. THE HERO: First, in chapter 1, we\u2019ll talk about the main character or \u201chero\u201d of your story, who they are, and why they are desperately in need of transformation. 2. THE BEATS: In chapter 2, we\u2019ll explore the fifteen beats of the Save the Cat! Beat Sheet in great detail so you can begin to map out the compelling, transformative journey of your novel. 3. THE GENRES: Then, in chapters 3\u201313, we\u2019ll identify the genre of your story using the ten Save the Cat! story genres. These are not your mother\u2019s genres (sci-fi, drama, comedy, and so on). Instead, the Save the Cat! story genres are broken down by type of character transformation and/or central theme. This will help you further develop your novel and make sure your story contains the necessary \u201cgenre ingredients\u201d to make it successful. Also in these chapters, I\u2019ll give you ten beat sheets for popular blockbuster novels (one for each story genre), so you can see how the fifteen beats apply to some of today\u2019s most successful books. 4. THE PITCH: By chapter 14, you\u2019ll have a pretty good idea of what your novel is about, which will help you distill the story down into a one-page description (the synopsis) and furthermore, into a one-sentence description (the logline) that you can use to pitch agents, editors, publishers, readers, and even movie producers. 5. THE FAQ: Despite the awesomeness and thoroughness of the previous chapters, I guarantee you\u2019ll have problems along the way. Which is why, in chapter 15, I give you practical solutions to the six most common problems novelists face when implementing the Save the Cat! methodology. What About the Cat?But wait! We forgot one important thing. The question that I\u2019m sure has been on your mind from the moment you first heard about this book or picked it up in the bookstore.Why on earth is it called \u201cSave the Cat!\u201d?The answer dates back to the original Save the Cat! book, in which Blake Snyder included several cleverly titled tips on how to avoid common pitfalls of storytelling. \u201cSave the cat!\u201d is one of these tips. If your main character starts off somewhat unlikable, then, in the early pages of your story, they should save a cat (yes, like from a tree or a burning building or a shelter), or do something comparable that immediately makes the reader root for them, regardless of their original likability. We\u2019ll talk more about cats and how to save them in chapter 15, when we break down some of the most common problems writers face when implementing the Save the Cat! methodology. Additionally, throughout this book, I\u2019ve included several new tips and tricks specifically for novelists to help you improve your story. So, let\u2019s get on with it already. Your main character is waiting, and they have a huge problem . . . Read more"

Either this author read my mind in the future and wrote exactly the book I needed to write my own series, or she is just that darn good. (Since she probably doesn't actually time travel or read minds, we'll go with the latter.) I have literally everything I need at my fingertips now to finish. I sat down and devoured this and took notes in one 24 hour period. Highly recommend, You will not be sorry. (Disclaimer: I'm a plotter, so I can only speak from that perspective. I straight up geeked out over the story board diagram and ordered supplies the minute I saw it.) THANK YOU to the author. Oh my goodness, my head is so full of ideas and directions I won't sleep!",

                "reviewText": "Save the Cat Writes a Novel is a delightful must read for any writer. Within these pages, I found so many of the base rules and ideas of forming a story that I have always known to be true. Jessica Brody- and in relation, Blake Snyder, the original author of Save the Cat (for screenwriting)- gives a wonderful account of why people read the books they read. Not in genres of horror, fantasy, or romance, but in genres of a much more important sort: the genre of storytelling. For any writer, or reader, these tropes will be quite familiar- from the down and out underdog to the love that encourages change. The theory that any writing can fit into these beats is not just a theory, but utter truth. Even stories that are not the norm, that defies any trope, can be seen here in small, subtle connections.While I find this novel to be accurate, and quite helpful in making the writer think about their stories, I\u2019ve given it a four out of five stars for my personal reading experience. I judge writing craft books on two things: Useful information, and enjoyment in reading.Useful information, this novel has in abundance. I find that I will likely use it as a reference book- something to flick open when I write a new story, to answer the questions within as I figure out where my story fits, or to reference the beats. The beat sheet within will work wonders for the hearts of plotters, though it is a little more in depth than my personal writing style, and that\u2019s okay. This novel isn\u2019t a die-hard blueprint to follow, but more of a guide.However, when it comes to enjoyment of reading, I found myself struggling a little bit. A good amount of this book plots the beat-by-beat process of other novels, putting them into the Save the Cat theory format and showing why it appears again and again in our favorite novels. This is a brilliant way to show an example of the process, but I don\u2019t think it is enticing enough to read again unless there is a specific reason. Thus, along with my lack of interest in the beat sheet, the next time I write a story, I will be pulling open the book and reading the specific chapter of the story genre I\u2019m working with, but I don\u2019t see myself rereading this entire book for quite some time.Overall, I think this book is a good start for an inexperienced writer, or someone who wants to see into the mind of those who study stories for a living. Or perhaps, just to study someone who is more well read than they are, as this novel does have lists upon lists of books that are must reads. I would recommend Save the Cat Writes a Novel to anyone with a writing craft shelf in their library, a staple of the genre, but I would caution your expectations. This is a good textbook to make notes of, but the take-away of information will vary on the experience of the reader.",

                "reviewText": "Last year was my first NaNo and I opted to keep it simple by prioritizing finishing the 50k words over taking on a novel. I did finish!This year I wanted to do more. Late October snuck up on me and I hunted around on YouTube and found this gem.I LOVE Save the Cat Writes a Novel! Over halfway through this year\u2019s NaNo and I\u2019m finding the approach direct enough to be used as step-by-step instructions and flexible enough to be treated more loosely and still keep me on track, ie you can be a planner or a pantser or a plantser or sinner and still get great value from this book.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

It effortlessly explains why using such a template is NOT a bad thing... and in fact, will 10x your productivity and success. I will have it by my side at all times when writing my novels.

                "reviewText": "\u00dcbersichtEinzelband oder Reihe: EinzelbandKapitell\u00e4nge: mittel bis langMeine Rezension\u201cYou \u201aneed\u2018 a good story. And I\u2019m going to help you get there.\u201c Seite 2Jedem erfolgreichen Buch liegt eine 15-Punkt-Struktur, bestehend aus wirksamen Schl\u00fcsselszenen, zugrunde \u2013 egal ob Romance-Bestseller oder Klassiker. Das behauptet und beweist Jessica Brody an konkreten Beispielen und versorgt uns mit einem \u201ePlot-Rezept\u201c, an dem sich Autor:innen sowohl orientieren k\u00f6nnen, wenn sie gerade ein neues Buch planen, als auch, wenn sie gerade irgendwo in der Mitte feststecken und feststellen: Irgendwas funktioniert hier nicht! Aber was? Und wie kann ich das Problem beheben?Begonnen habe ich dieses Buch, weil ich seit vielen Jahren ein fast fertiges Romantasy-Projekt in meiner Schublade liegen habe. Abgesehen davon, dass ich dieses Projekt mittlerweile stark \u00fcberarbeiten m\u00fcsste, weil ich mich nat\u00fcrlich weiterentwickelt habe (gerade aus feministischer Sicht) und es meinen heutigen Anspr\u00fcchen nicht mehr gerecht w\u00fcrde, hatte ich immer schon ein gro\u00dfes Problem damit: Ich konnte es einfach nicht beenden. Deshalb habe ich einfach immer weitergeschrieben und das Ende hinausgez\u00f6gert, weil ich nicht wusste, wie (und wann) man einen guten Schluss verfasst. Um dieses Plot-Problem besser zu verstehen und eventuell l\u00f6sen zu k\u00f6nnen, griff ich zu \u201eSave the Cat! Writes a Novel\u201c.Der Aufbau wirkt durchdacht und hat mir gut gefallen: Zuerst geht die Autorin darauf ein, was eine gute Hauptfigur ausmacht, dann erkl\u00e4rt sie die 15-Schritt-Struktur, die ihrer Meinung nach jeder guten Geschichte zugrunde liegt. Im Anschluss bringt sie uns 10 inhaltliche Genres n\u00e4her (z. B. \u201eMonster in the house\u201c, statt \u201eHorror\u201c) und informiert uns dar\u00fcber, aus welchen Elementen diese bestehen sollten (z. B. Monster + Haus + S\u00fcnde), um die Leser:innen abzuholen, ihre Erwartungen zu erf\u00fcllen und sie gut zu unterhalten. Am Ende analysiert sie mit uns Bestseller und Klassiker und zeigt uns, wie diese Struktur in der Praxis aussehen kann. Als Beispiele w\u00e4hlt sie tats\u00e4chlich sehr bekannte und erfolgreiche B\u00fccher aus, was f\u00fcr mich das Ganze noch spannender machte, weil ich viel davon schon gelesen und geliebt hatte (zum Beispiel: \u201eEin ganzes halbes Jahr\u201c, \u201eDie Tribute von Panem\u201c, \u201eStolz und Vorurteil\u201c). Nicht nur einmal hatte ich w\u00e4hrend der Lekt\u00fcre einen Aha-Moment, manches fiel mir wie Schuppen von den Augen! (Passt hier bitte nur auf, dass ihr nicht versehentlich gespoilert werdet, gerade wenn ihr ein bestimmtes Buch noch lesen wollt!)Der Schreibstil enth\u00e4lt eine Prise Humor, ist einfach gehalten, fl\u00fcssig und verst\u00e4ndlich, sodass es f\u00fcr die meisten von euch kein Problem sein d\u00fcrfte, das Buch wie ich auf Englisch zu lesen. Meiner Meinung nach hat die Autorin nicht zu viel versprochen: \u201eSave the Cat! Writes a Novel\u201c kann einem in jeder Situation helfen, weil es einem eine Grundstruktur liefert, an der man sich orientieren kann, und weil es verhindert, dass man sich in seiner Geschichte verliert oder zu keinem Ende kommt (wie ich). Au\u00dferdem habe ich das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich nun ein besseres Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr (zielgerichtete) Plotstrukturen und H\u00f6hepunkte habe \u2013 sowohl bei meinen eigenen Texten als auch bei B\u00fcchern, die ich lese. Nicht selten passiert es mir jetzt, dass ich die von Jessica Brody erw\u00e4hnten Elemente zuf\u00e4llig entdeckte. Diese Erkenntnisse nehmen dem Lesen aber trotzdem nicht ihren Zauber und ihre Faszination \u2013 im Gegenteil, es ist eher so, dass ich einen gut aufgebauten, wendungsreichen Roman nun noch mehr sch\u00e4tzen kann (wenn ich dann merke, dass die Autor:innen sich hier wirklich Gedanken gemacht haben). Meiner Meinung nach ist der vorliegende Schreibratgeber besonders f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger:innen extrem hilfreich und ich werde in Zukunft auf jeden Fall haupts\u00e4chlich mit dieser Methode arbeiten \u2013 vielleicht sogar nur mehr mit dieser Methode.Mein FazitEgal ob ihr zuerst plottet oder am liebsten einfach mal wild drauflos schreibt \u2013 dieser Schreibratgeber holt euch genau dort ab, wo ihr steht, und wird auch euch ein Grundger\u00fcst zum Festhalten liefern, euch bei Problemen weiterhelfen und eure Geschichten besser machen. Von mir gibt es deshalb eine gro\u00dfe Leseempfehlung f\u00fcr alle Autor:innen und die, die es werden wollen!BewertungEinstieg: 4 SterneInhalt: 5 Sterne \u2665Verst\u00e4ndlichkeit: 5 Sterne \u2665Schreibstil: 5 Sterne \u2665Insgesamt:\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606 SterneDieses Buch bekommt von mir f\u00fcnf Sterne!",
