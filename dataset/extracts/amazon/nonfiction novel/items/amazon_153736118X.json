                "reviewText": "What I really liked about Thayer's book is its strange effect on future reading (rather than writing). I catch stuff I've never noticed before. It's been interesting on the post-read side. I hope I can transfer the skills. I've lately done a lot of technical/scientific writings that verge on fiction to one degree or another.After 40 some years of technical/science writing as a pup physicist, then proofing the increasingly esoteric stuff as a 30-something, then begrudgingly approving the drivel of incoherent ramblings in my 40's ... I'm back to writing again. Thayer helps one to know how much one doesn't know about the stuff that makes writing vivid. A sizzling hot, medium-energy physics proposal may be in my future!This is a quick, concise read of do and do not's. Of these how-to-write-good books, this one leaves the reader the opportunity to consider the published, edited snippets of high-octane novel writers. It's a great primer to pick up on `habitual' bad practice and for logical reasons. Since Thayer, I've been testing other author's practices and deconstructing dialogue, settings, `moving forward', etc.Applying the Thayer `method' has been an eye-opening experience. Several of Thayer's referenced big name writers might learn a thing or three reading Thayer. An editor can go wild with the `dialogue' do's and don'ts.I have read one less than popular author since this read that was Thayer-perfect in my dissecting opinion (good book too!). I read a big machine author that was full of Thayer 'violation's' and that could have easily spruced up his offering with Thayer. There is a startling qualitative difference in a Thayer followed novel.I left you with at least 1 Thayer mistake in writing this review ... can you find it?",

                "reviewText": "This book truly is an \"essential\" guide. The key word in the title is \"Concise\". While there are chapters on subjects that are truly essential, the material is more 'concise' than it is thorough. There are dos and don't s for each topic, as well as examples from published authors. I believe it is a great guide, and I would also recommend delving further into each topic with additional books or references to continue the study of the craft of writing.I would honestly say that the only thing that bugged me about this book was the excessive amount of quotes in first few chapters. Naturally, you have to start somewhere, so Thayer started the book with the \"Basic Ingredients\", \"Before Sitting Down at the Desk\", \"Our Production Style\", and \"Organizing to Start\" chapters. The meat of the those chapters were great tidbits of advice, but in my opinion, there were too many quotes from other authors or historical figures regarding those subjects. On some pages there are as many as 6 different quotes! \"I prefer to write my novels this way\" said Stephen King. Another Author said \"I do it this other way because that is what works for me!\" I understand he was trying to illustrate that successful authors do not all write in the same manner, but I just felt there was just an excessive amount of those quotes. I found myself losing interest and skimming those chapters. I didn't see that continue in the rest of the book to that degree, which is why I still enjoyed this guide.This book is a great guide. I have highlighted, flagged and made notes throughout the book, so I anticipate this guide to be very useful in the future.",

I don't want to go through that sort of pain, so I took Thayer's class. For those who can't, this book is the next best thing; maybe even better since most of my notes are illegible.Thayer has condensed thirty plus years of professional writing experience and five years teaching experience into a comprehensive, yet surprisingly concise book. This is not a 700 page endless tome. And by the way, don't take his word for any of it. Nearly every point he makes in the book is backed by quotes and excerpts from celebrated authors and editors. That may be the best part about it. Thayer has not tried to carve out his own niche on writing, setting his own rules and regulations to the craft. Quite the contrary, he has tried to learn from the best and pooled all that information into one resource. He speaks to the author that wants to write a commercially viable book. His teachings are about getting you published, not about making that one in a million experimental art piece.The book starts with creating a writing routine, then it covers character, scene and story development, then points of view and controlling pace, and finally a series of useful sections on the craft of writing itself (like how to write dialogue, and avoiding worthless modifiers). About the only thing that it didn't cover in detail is obtaining an agent and writing a query letter. And I would not describe it as a story development book. The basics of story are talked about, but Thayer does not delve into the depths of dissecting the Hero's Journey. That subject is a slippery art and this book focuses on concrete tips that will improve your writing immediately.",

As a beginner I can really recommend his book. I would also suggest to read some of his novels too, so you can see how he uses his knowledge to actually write something.

An excellent starter manual for anyone who throws down an unfinished read, thinking \"I can write a better novel than that.\" The old hand at writing novels will also find much of value. Thayer pulls no punches: he is explicit about structuring a novel, giving lots of flexibility to your approach, spelling out what works and why it works, and giving step-by-step instructions (1 - 2 - 3 - 4...) for structuring, as well as excellent guidance in editing. Readers today are looking for immediate action, immediate engagement, realism, gripping story lines, sympathetic not-too-perfect characters, clear writing, and easy style - everything that the author himself is known for. He goes through the usual problems, from finding the time and place to write, through to editing your own work before submitting it to agent or publisher, and includes a nice little section about grammatical and stylistic no-no's.The best part of this book, aside from its clarity and organization, is that it addresses the problems of writing for today's readers, who have much less patience than even ten years ago. Today's readers were weaned on television, the instant entertainment.",
