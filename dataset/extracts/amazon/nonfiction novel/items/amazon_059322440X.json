                "reviewText": "We purchased this graphic novel at my 6yo daughter's school's Book Fair. She loves St. Joan of Arc and was excited to read it. As she was reading it, she kept asking if St. Joan used to yell a lot and mentioned that she yells a lot in this graphic novel. When she finished it, she was not left inspired, but rather was disdainful of the portrayal of St. Joan. Upon reading it, I didn't notice dialogue that would imply yelling, but the illustrations of St. Joan show her, in my opinion, aggressive and angry, which is why, I am guessing, that my daughter did not care for the book. On a separate note, the author decided to push her own political agenda by stating the following, \"At the time, acts of heresy included...wearing clothes that didn't match your assigned gender\". Please don't push your politics on our kids. Keep it neutral. The author could have left out \"assigned\" and it would have been much more accurate since the concept of \"assigning\" is so very modern. At the very end of the graphic novel she also stated, \"It is true Jeanne helped end a terrible war. It is also true that she promoted violence against people just for having different religious beliefs.\" Um, examples please? This statement was in her concluding paragraph. Either back it up or leave it out. Poor writing.",
