        "description": "Homicide, the celebrated true crime book from the creator of HBO's The Wire, is reenvisioned as a gritty, cinematic graphic novel duology. This thrilling second volume concludes the saga.A woman is stabbed and left to die in her bedroom. A taxi cab driver is killed for a handful of jewelry. A man is gunned down over a debt of $8.
