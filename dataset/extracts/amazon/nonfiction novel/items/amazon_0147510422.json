                "reviewText": "This book is a great model of what one person with an idea could do. \u201cThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,\u201d is an autobiographical novel written by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer. It focuses on how WIlliam Kamwamba tries to make a windmill from scraps even though he could not continue going to school.When William\u2019s tiny village in Malawi, Africa, was struck by a horrendous famine, he and family could barely feed each other due to the loss of crops, leave alone paying for school. Forced to drop out of school, William found a library book that gave him a huge idea - he could build a windmill for power made out of scraps and not only could it help his family, but it could also help the village.It is truly a story about an inspiring boy that changed many lives. It takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion with a lot of twists and turns. \u201cI tried and I succeeded\u201d is one of the best quotes. The problem and the words William Kamkawamba used were so realistic, it made the book come alive.I recommend it for people who want to hear about overcoming problems, a different culture, and a hero\u2019s journey. People from ten and beyond should read this. I rate this a 5/5 book because of its plot and word of choice. I really liked the ending of the book when he described what he changed. Also it gave me an important realization of how people struggle to get education. If you read this, you will be inspired.",
