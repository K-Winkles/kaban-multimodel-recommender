            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Sacco uses the comic book format to its fullest extent, creating bold perspectives that any photojournalist would envy.\" \u2015 Utne Reader\"Sacco is a pioneer.\" \u2015 Journal of Palestinian Studies\"Based on his research, interviews, and personal experiences in Palastinian Occupied Territories in 1991 and 92, [Palestine] takes you there and gives you a first-hand account of the atrocities and suffering in the conflict with Israel. He gives you a close up visual rendering of the physical and emotional conditions of the people, who struggle daily for survival... Sacco has rendered the terrible conditions of life into a compelling and sympathetic artistic documentary. It is sad, but most good stories are sad... What\u2019s better, his drawing is detailed and realistic, very approachable and interesting.\" \u2015 American in Auckland About the Author Joe Sacco lives in Portland, Oregon. He is the author of many acclaimed graphic novels, including Palestine, Safe Area Gorazde, But I Like It, Notes from a Defeatist, The Fixer, War's End, and Footnotes in Gaza.Edward W. Said was University Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia.

        "description": "A landmark of journalism and the art form of comics. Based on several months of research and an extended visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the early 1990s, this is a major work of political and historical nonfiction. Prior to Safe Area Gorazde: The War In Eastern Bosnia 1992-1995\u2015Joe Sacco's breakthrough novel of graphic journalism\u2015the acclaimed author was best known for Palestine, a two-volume graphic novel that won an American Book Award in 1996. Fantagraphics Books is pleased to present the first single-volume collection of this landmark of journalism and the art form of comics. Based on several months of research and an extended visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the early 1990s (where he conducted over 100 interviews with Palestinians and Jews), Palestine was the first major comics work of political and historical nonfiction by Sacco, whose name has since become synonymous with this graphic form of New Journalism. Like Safe Area Gorazde, Palestine has been favorably compared to Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus for its ability to brilliantly navigate such socially and politically sensitive subject matter within the confines of the comic book medium. Sacco has often been called the first comic book journalist, and he is certainly the best. This edition of Palestine also features an introduction from renowned author, critic, and historian Edward Said (Peace and Its Discontents and The Question of Palestine), one of the world's most respected authorities on the Middle Eastern conflict. Black-and-white comics throughout",

Reading well written stories and non fiction, however, does not allow me to visualize the expressions, the demeanor, the angst, the humanity behind the stories. Joe Sacco's Palestine makes sure that I never ever complain about my lack of a third eye. His drawings have captured all the human emotions that the ordinary Palestinian goes through. The despair, the anger, the arrogance that they will one day prevail .... its all depicted clearly and in a way that makes you feel as if you are in the pages of the book, living and breathing Joe's life.A well crafted, beautifully drawn and hauntingly real book. A must read for all graphic novel lovers.*Please note that by way of this review, I am not debating the right or wrong of the conflict. I am only talking about the sense of 'being there' that Joe has managed to capture*",

                "reviewText": "When first getting this book I was expecting something completely different. Joe Sacco does a great job putting into light the Israelite- Palestinian conflict. Not going to lie I was expecting a more kid friendly book but the language at times is more adult language, but the humor throughout the book is great. Joe takes a risk to go to the streets of Palestine and interviews all aspects of the conflict and hears the voices from poisoners, refugees, people protesting of all ages. One of the biggest parts that I remember and was so touching was when Joe goes to the refugee camp. Joe goes into great detail about how many people are struggling and how big the camp was. I was unaware of this situation before reading this book. I knew that there was a middle eastern issue, but I was unaware that this situation was this fragile and that it had been going on for so long. I feel that because of the interviews being put into a graphic novel style it will interest the younger students, but as stated be aware of the adult language being used. Overall it is a very interesting read and very factual and eye opening to the current issue of Palestine and Israel.",

The graphic comic format of the book really brings a visceral feel to the day to day suffering endured by the Palestinian people.The emphasis is on the lived experience rather than the numbers killed, jailed, dispossessed, but those numbers are dropped in from time to time with great effect.",
