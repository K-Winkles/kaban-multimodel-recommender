                "reviewText": "The Unwanted: Stories of the Syrian RefugeesBy Don BrownThis book starts out by explaining how all of it started and escalated. It follows the typical Syrian family or families and how they try to escape and where they would have to go and how. What they would have to encounter along the way. What would be the likely outcome. Where are most of the refugees now? How are they living? Why are they not getting help? All is explained in here in a way that makes sense and none of it is the refugees fault. None! They are trying to survive! To keep their kids alive! I would do the same.It's a heartbreaking thing that's happening and it's the same as South America. But no one wants to help the immigrants that are fleeing for their lives either! Not even the new president. Shameful!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Necessary reading",
                "reviewText": "In my spare time, I like to read fiction. If you\u2019re familiar with my blog, you\u2019ll know I especially lean toward the science fiction and fantasy end of the fiction spectrum. However, as a teacher, I must often read beyond my personal preference to find texts that will inform as well as entertain. Add that to the fact that my students prefer graphic novels (and why wouldn\u2019t they \u2013 they\u2019re accessible texts!), and I find myself searching graphic novel lists for nonfiction to incorporate in my classroom library. One excellent nonfiction graphic novel I read a few years ago (and put on the bookcase afterward), The Unwanted: Stories of the Syrian Refugees by Don Brown, has been quite popular with my 9th and 11th grade students.Don Brown\u2019s book is haunting nonfiction that outlines the ongoing conflict in Syria and shares individual anecdotes of Syrian refugees fleeing that violence. He keeps the context streamlined \u2013 this is not a sprawling war epic, but a general timeline peppered with vignettes to personalize the sheer scope of the war and its consequences. In retelling personal stories of some of the 6 million refugees, Brown does not delve too deeply into sectarian or religious divides, but instead outlines the enormity of the need, and the proportionally tiny U.S. response. The Unwanted is a brutal indictment of American self-absorption.I don\u2019t know what you remember about your teenage years, but I remember having a rapacious curiosity about the world \u2013 wanting to know (or experience) all of the things my parents had deemed me too young for, or had perhaps purposely left out of my education. I see that same thirst for knowledge in many of my students: they\u2019re angry at the state of the world, constantly taking in new information, and want to know WHY they were never told about some of the deep inequalities and tragedies of the past and the present. They want to know why we don\u2019t tell the dark secrets \u2013 why we aren\u2019t honest. I believe that books like The Unwanted are exactly the sort of texts that we can and should share with children. I don\u2019t mean to prove that we do care, or to absolve ourselves, but to keep stories alive, and to look the truth straight on and without flinching.Brown clearly means for this title to be educational \u2013 it is especially suited for use in politics and current events (even years after its first publication!!) units. The content is sobering, tragic, and at times violent. I can envision pairing it with Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night, or in a graphic novel unit with Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Persepolis or Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus.As a graphic novel, it\u2019s important to address the art style. Brown uses pen and ink with digital paint in washed out colors \u2013 a palette of browns and grays for the most part. This color scheme matches the seriousness of the content. Brown\u2019s illustrations are quite spare \u2013 facial expressions are not very clearly depicted, and the linework at time feels sparse as well. When first reading the book, I did not love the art style \u2013 but I came around \u2013 I think it is as necessary and important to the storytelling as the anecdotal, vignette-style prose.In all, The Unwanted is one of the most honest, unvarnished graphic novels for young adults on the refugee experience \u2013 and I\u2019ve read a fair few. Its honesty asks something of its reader. I think the world needs more books like it.Recommended for: readers ages 12 and up; it is necessary reading.",

                "reviewText": "This graphic novel begins with a peaceful drawing of a child and a map with the location of Syria and its cities in the world. It quickly introduces the first act of rebellion against Assad in 2011. Brown jumps right into the brutality of the Syrian Civil War and the dangers that everyday Syrians encountered. There are examples of Assad\u2019s attempts to silence his people and the atrocities acted out upon them, both in text as well as in descriptive drawings. Brown includes a variety of different examples of the ways that people left Syria and where they were going. There is no direct plot line in this story but it flows together wonderfully. There are descriptions of the boats people traveled on their interactions with the smugglers and fellow refugees. Text bubbles provide the reader with the thoughts that crowd the minds of the refugees along with their hopes and desires for a life of safety for themselves and their children. The book includes facts and figures that breakdown the statistics of the refugee crisis. There are pages that show the impact of Islamophobia on the acceptance and help offered to refugees. The book returns to the little girl from the beginning and the hope all refugees share.The Unwanted is a stunning graphic novel that tells and shows the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis. The images depicted show the terror and hope on the faces of men, women, and children as they seek safety in a new land. Don Brown includes facts and figures as he weaves the tales of refugees together. He shares their pain and worries and the harsh realities of what it is like to be a person who has to flee the country that they love. His depictions are factual and he provides a lengthy list of sources and further readings. The images are heart-wrenching and bring to life the sparse text to truly impact the effect of this crisis on the reader. The book is nuanced in its approach to capturing the many lives that have been affected but does a great job at stressing the dangers that refugees face and the risks that they are willing to take. This is a great book to introduce readers to the Syrian refugee crisis and would be a wonderful addition to any classroom.",
