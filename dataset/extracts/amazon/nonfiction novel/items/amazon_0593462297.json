                "reviewText": "\"Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi . . .\"*Through the magic of this delightful graphic memoir, Pedro Martin shares his tale of growing up one of nine children. The first five of the kids were born in Mexico \"in an adobe barn with cattle around. Probably.\" They were forever known by their later siblings as \"BARN BABIES.\" The youngest four of the tribe were born in the USA and called \"HOSPITAL BABIES\"Martin's story mostly involves a trip into deepest Mexico to collect, and bring to the U.S., the venerable Abuelito, who turns out to be a genuine Mexican folk hero - a real \"Jedi-Mexican-Batman/Catholic Hulk.\" Lessons are learned along the way, and new sights, sounds, and taste experiences abound, including delicious desserts made with raw milk (digestible only by the barn babies) and that trippy wonder that is Mexican soda made with REAL SUGAR - \"It settled into the corners of mouths, our shirts, our hair . . . and eventually into our very souls.\"We also learn the handy Mexican Jedi Mind Trick where participants attempt to wriggle out of sticky situations by inquiring, \"Didn't I used to milk cows with your cousin Jos\u00e9 Luis?\" . . . because in Mexico, almost everyone \"has a cousin named Jos\u00e9 Luis that PROBABLY milked cows.\"This was both heartwarming, and HILARIOUS, and one of my favorite books of the year. Whether you're somewhat Mexican or somewhat American, or even a barn baby, you're sure to be reminded of your own wacky family, and perhaps, that one unforgettable trip you all took together.*If you want to know the significance of this snippet of a Broadway show tune, you'll have to read the book!",

I hesitated to buy this book, since it was obviously something different. By the end of the first two or three pages I was hooked, and devoured it eagerly over a couple of days.There were some surprise story arcs that went off on a tangent, always a good one.It took a while to finish the last few pages because I had to keep wiping tears from my eyes, smiling all the while. My Spanish teacher once graded one of my papers \"A Plus Bravo,\" and this book earns the same grade.",
