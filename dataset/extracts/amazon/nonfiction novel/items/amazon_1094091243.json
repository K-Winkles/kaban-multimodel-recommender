                "reviewText": "I bought this book for my teenage son, Aidan, but it sat collecting dust on his nightstand. He\u2019d rather be outdoors doing rather than inside reading. I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain. I found it one day while cleaning his room (which I will complain about) and read the first few pages to see if it captured my attention. They did, and it easily found its way on my list of favorites.The Twenty-Ninth Day is a powerful coming-of-age story. Alex Messenger was 17 years old when he set out to canoe 700 miles in the remote Canadian wilderness with friends and an adult mentor. On the twenty-ninth day of the trip, he was attacked by a grizzly bear. Clearly, he survived to tell the tale, and what a gift he has for telling it.The only thing I know about canoeing is from a crazy escapade of rescuing an abandoned one in the Smokies. So I suspected the story might bore me until the attack. I also wondered if the book would make me more fearful for my kids on adventures they take apart from me, especially Aidan who is now eighteen and spreading his wings to fly further away by the day.On both counts, I was proven wrong. It made me want more adventures like this for my kids, despite the inherent risks. The story is a bold testament to the benefits of exposing youth to experiences outside of their comfort zone, especially if it puts them in the natural world sans a computer screen.Alex\u2019s writing style is a bit Heminway-esque to me. Not in a one-syllable kind of way, but in the uncluttered yet descriptive prose he uses to describe the setting, story and his emotions. Not to mention he\u2019s just a cool, old soul kind of kid (now adult) who was wise beyond his years at the formative age when these events occurred.Finally, as a search and rescue team member, this book held special interest for me in how the group handled Alex\u2019s attack. I won\u2019t give anything away, but I will say I wish everyone was as level-headed and prepared in the event of a true backcountry emergency. This would be a fantastic book to discuss and debate with my teammates and outdoor enthusiast friends.",

It is extremely well written -- so much so that I had to keep reminding myself that this was written by a young man of seventeen, still in high school. He writes better than many adults -- and has the emotional maturity of someone years older. I am many years older than Alex but I don't know if I could have even convinced myself to go on such a trip -- much less be able to handle myself so well when face to face with an angry bear in a harsh wilderness environment! The story of these young men navigating many miles of northern wilderness, by canoe and facing stormy weather, wild animals, food shortage, a lost canoe and more is inspiring and captivating. This would also make an excellent movie.",
