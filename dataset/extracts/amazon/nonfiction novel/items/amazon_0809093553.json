        "description": "Trinity, the debut graphic book by Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, depicts the dramatic history of the race to build and the decision to drop the first atomic bomb in World War Two\u2015with a focus on the brilliant, enigmatic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer.\"Succeeds as both a graphic primer and a philosophical meditation.\" \u2015Kirkus Reviews (starred review)This sweeping historical narrative traces the spark of invention from the laboratories of nineteenth-century Europe to the massive industrial and scientific efforts of the Manhattan Project, and even transports the reader into a nuclear reaction\u2015into the splitting atoms themselves.The power of the atom was harnessed in a top-secret government compound in Los Alamos, New Mexico, by a group of brilliant scientists led by the enigmatic wunderkind J. Robert Oppenheimer. Focused from the start on the monumentally difficult task of building an atomic weapon, these men and women soon began to wrestle with the moral implications of actually succeeding. When they detonated the first bomb at a test site code-named Trinity, they recognized that they had irreversibly thrust the world into a new and terrifying age.With powerful renderings of WWII's catastrophic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Fetter-Vorm unflinchingly chronicles the far-reaching political, environmental, and psychological effects of this new invention. Informative and thought-provoking, Trinity is the ideal introduction to one of the most significant events in history. Read more",

                "reviewText": "I remember being in 10th grade World History and learning all about WWII and the atomic bomb. I also remember that my teacher could never really explain how such a devastating weapon functioned. She would simply say, \"An atom splits and it explodes.\" Although I appreciate her attempt, I never understood how a thing as small as an atom could be split, and beyond that, how an atom could cause such a grand explosion. I tried Wikipedia but that just complicated things even more. I never truly understood the atomic bomb until I picked up this graphic novel.The graphic novel does a great job in explaining every single event that lead to the bomb's creation. It does it all chronologically, so page-flipping is not necessary. The book also introduces A LOT of names that you have probably never heard of before, but they are all tied to the events so it isn't pointless information. The book jumps from location to location with ease and it's hard to get lost since the author/artist makes good distinctions when the timeline jumps.Another aspect of this graphic novel that I really, really loved was that the science aspect of it (there's a lot of science in this graphic novel) is explained and depicted. Every step that there is to creating an atomic bomb and its explosion is drawn out. Unless you became a Chemistry Major after high school, then remembering all those concepts is difficult. I actually understood the science concepts because of his drawings.The author also ends the graphic novel with an opinion of his own, which is cool since most of the graphic novel was very fact-oriented.If I were back in high school I would have loved to read this book, not just because it has pictures, but because it is easy to follow, entertaining, and highly informative.",

                "reviewText": "Jonathan Fetter-Vorm's \"Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb\" traces the origins of atomic theory, the early work developing a working knowledge of critical mass, the Trinity test, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the early Cold War, all while telling the story through the framing device of Robert Oppenheimer preparing the Trinity test for July 16, 1945. Fetter-Vorm's art brilliantly condenses complex concepts, such as atomic theory, in a manner that's both dramatic and easy to understand. He also knows when to let the art speak for itself, such as in his portrayal of the aftermath of Nagasaki. As an historian, Fetter-Vorm echoes the conclusions of John Earl Haynes when he writes, \"Even before this world war had ended, the Cold War had begun\" (pg. 93). As both an introduction to the history of the early atomic age and an insightful volume in its own right, Fetter-Vorm's \"Trinity\" belongs on the reading list of Cold War historians and students alike.",

With the passage of seven decades most of us have forgotten much about the Manhattan project, and this book is a great refresher for those of us up in years or for those born after WWII but old enough to be frightened by the saber rattling of the Cold War.All in all, I recommend this book to all but the most serious and advanced students of nuclear weaponry.",

Given the book's format, I hadn't expected to learn all that much about fission or nuclear science or uranium refining, but Fetter-Vorm does an admirable job of packing in details, and makes full use of the unique potential afforded by graphic books to render complex reactions and physical phenomena into understandable (and excellently done) illustrations.Although the subtitle bills it as a \"history of the first atomic bomb,\" \"Trinity\" focuses most of its attention on the human aspects of its development: the driven and often eccentric personalities who headed the project, the colossal organizational challenges they faced, the impact of the bomb's successful construction on politics and diplomacy, and -- in some of its most stirring passages -- the immediate experience of an atomic explosion, whether viewed from a safe distance or ground zero. The book succeeds in its ambition to peer past the visceral, awesome power of nuclear weapons to the people and the historical forces which brought them into being.",
