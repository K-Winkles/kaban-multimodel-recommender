The other one's going to another dtr for her b'day. This is a must-have, for any NVPeale Positive Thinker fan; especially those who are in the 12-step programs. These short daily gems are just perfect for those who don't have a lot of time for essential morning meditations. I hope they keep these in stock, as they are great all-occasion gifts...and I need a new one, myself!",
