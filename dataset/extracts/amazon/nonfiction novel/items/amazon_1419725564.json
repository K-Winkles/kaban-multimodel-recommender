            "Editorial Reviews From School Library Journal Gr 3\u20137\u2014Presented in the author's instantly recognizable artistic and storytelling style, this new series installment centers on the Doolittle air raid over Japan during World War II. The book starts with a brief explanation of events pre\u2014Pearl Harbor (and an even briefer, information-packed history of Japanese military history); soon after, the action begins with a literal bang. Hale describes the bombing of Pearl Harbor from Japanese and American points of view. In response, the U.S. military set up a supersecret counterattack organized by stunt pilot Jimmy Doolittle. Pilots and crew manning 16 planes trained to bomb targets over Japan. Their fate after the attack is harrowing and no detail is left out. While small, the panels are readable, and the graphic novel's small size makes it portable. Though works of history might not fly off the shelves, Hale's tendency to incorporate character commentary, infographics, and fun facts will draw readers. VERDICT Purchase for all libraries, and give this title to readers interested in action-packed graphic novels, especially patrons aging out of the \"Magic Treehouse\" books.\u2014Morgan Brickey, Arlington Public Library, TX Review \"Harrowing and no detail is left out . . .

Thrilling, bloody, action-packed stories from American history.\u201d \u2014New York Times Presented in the author\u2019s instantly recognizable artistic and storytelling style, this colorful, exciting book of history for kids starts with a brief explanation of the events leading up to World War II and then describes the bombing of Pearl Harbor from both the Japanese and American points of view. The American response was a super-secret counterattack organized by stunt pilot Jimmy Doolittle. Just four months after Pearl Harbor, American crews would launch sixteen B-25 bombers from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to drop bombs on the Japanese capital Tokyo and then fly to safety in China. Everything about the mission was as dangerous as it was secret. B-25s were not designed to take off from an aircraft carrier. Japan had formidable air defenses. There was no way to plan for landing in China or returning safely to America. The Doolittle Raid, as it became known, went down in military history as one of the most creative and harrowing missions of World War II. The pilots and crews became American heroes.Nathan Hale\u2019s Hazardous Tales!

My teens devoured the book, reading it five times in four days.Some language may not be appropriate for young readers: damn and hellThe illustrations in the book do a great job with the American and Japanese fleets. One of my sons wanted more about the Japanese.Two details noted by another son were left out: the book omits Enterprise's role in providing air escorts for the Raiders, and the perfect timing required to launch the B-25s off the deck of the Hornet.Highly recommend this entire series. More books like this, please!One son asks for a book about the Navy Seal Medal of Honor winners in Viet Nam. Another wants one about \"54-40 or Fight!\" It would be great to have a book about the Pueblo Revolt of 1680.",

I\u2019ve even had to confiscate them when he has chosen to read \u201c just a little bit more\u201d when he is supposed to be sleeping.

Sometimes this books pack too many panels on one page and it's a lot to take it. Love this series.",

They can have themes that may be shocking for some, but those opened good discussions for our family. For example, _The Underground Abductor_ exposes some atrocities of slavery that I wasn't aware of. Our kid asked questions, and we talked them out.If you have a kid who loves learning and humor and you can handle having discussions about hard stuff occasionally, then I highly recommend these books.We have loaned a couple to friends who don't love reading for pleasure, and they also LOVED these books.",

                "reviewText": "My 9 year old is addicted to Nathan Hale's books. He loves history and comic books, so Hale combines the best of both worlds. The artistry is good. The stories are historically accurate. The story format is easy to follow and packs a lot of information into an easy-to-read format. My mother is a reading specialist and I am a librarian and we both plan on using these in our respective areas of reading education.",
