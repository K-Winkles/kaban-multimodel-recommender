        "description": "In his two inspired masterworks, Walden and Civil Disobedience, Henry David Thoreau reflects on life, politics, and society.Thoreau relocated to a cottage on the shores of Walden Pond in Massachusetts in 1845, which he constructed himself. Thoreau reaped both physically and mentally from the earth, and searched truth in the stillness of nature, shedding the superficial ties that he felt linked much of humanity. He describes how isolating oneself from the world of men can actually awaken the sleeping self in Walden. Thoreau is a firm believer in the idea that you haven't actually existing until you embrace such a lifestyle\u2014and that only then can you reenter society as a wise being.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed reading Thoreau's account of living at Walden pond and I especially enjoyed hearing his perspective. I will say that towards the end he was beginning to lose me with the extremely detailed description of the winter time and the freezing over and thawing of the pond. I was also getting a sense of Thoreau giving himself too much praise but he does manage to alleviate that with some conflicting perspective and even poking fun at himself. Overall I felt that Walden was totally worth the read.Note: My copy had 16 pages of Huckleberry Finn printed right in the middle of the book! The Walden pages were replaced so I had to read those 16 pages online. Oddly enough, some of those missing pages included...HUCKLEBERRIES! I at least got a good laugh out of this.",

Bound in a classic and impressive cover, it has 2 photos of Thoreau for fans of his works (such as me). But, it is his words which give one pause. Which make the idea of living in the woods, completely self-sufficiently, not as far-fetched as it may first seem. I enjoy this book each time i read it. It's a classic, full of great quotes for those who ruminate on the nature of man, and the beauty of living simply.",

I decided to read Walden once again, now that I am 51, to see if I would have a different impression and guess what? No. Thoreau can translate in words what I have in my own essence. It is so good to see that you think exactly like your \"idol\"!...",

                "reviewTitle": "Can I dare to rate Walden?..it is beyond words..5 stars for fortune of reading Walden by Thoreau",
                "reviewText": "I am writing this review after only reading an extract (about four pages) from Walden, which I chanced to read many years back, in Readers\u2019 Digest by the title-\u2018Simplify! Simplify!. Besides, this extract, I read some quotes from this wonderful being of Mother Nature. I do not think I will ever need to read Walden in full. Those four pages are sufficient for this birth. It is about the most beautiful phenomenon \u2014 LIFE itself.When I read those four pages, I did not know who the writer was. I came to know about it many years afterwards. I simply cannot describe the feeling when I read those four pages. It was a revelation. As if one was experiencing a cool breeze after a scorching, humid, itching, heat. A cool breeze that was soothing not only the body, but the soul as well. All of us know what a feeling it is when something goes deep inside the soul. It is something very beyond emotion. Indescribable.As I see from Walden, (for me), Thoreau is the highest level a human can aspire for.We call US a super power (we have animal belief about Might over Right).It is worth mentioning what Thoreau wrote about it He called America \u2018a nation ruined by luxury and heedless expense\u2019. This is what we see today. He also gave a \u2018Covid cure\u2019\u2013\u2018 and the only cure for it (America) as for them (the households in America) is in a rigid economy, a more than Spartan like simplicity of life and elevation of purpose\u2019. One fails to understand why we love weapons, war and destruction.I see many similarities between Thoreau and our beloved MK Gandhi. I would like to mention a few of them here.1. There is only one education, that of character.2. They were all soul, believed that body is maintained by soul. Ate bare minimum.3. Were free from desires, believed desires to be bonds.4. There is only ONE development-that of our soul. External development is superficial. Everything resides inside ourselves.5. Both were extreme lovers of Mother Nature. They drew inspiration from Mother Nature.6. They would never like to see anyone \u2018following them\u2019. In Thoreau\u2019s words-\u2018let everyone endeavor to be what he was made for.\u20197. They both loved Solitude. I think they would both have lived in the woods for their entire life, had they not resolved to battle Might over Right by Civil Disobedience.8. They never sermonized. They demonstrated what they stood for.9. They spoke in everyday simple language.As regards riches and rich people, Thoreau used to say, \u2019That man is the richest whose pleasures are the cheapest.\u2019 In our \u2018new world\u2019 we see richness in only money. We do not even see how it was earned. Such thinking is despicable.I would like to thank two reviewers for their comments which are as follows:(a)\"Rather than love, money, faith, fame and fairness.. Give me truth(b) In the life-affirming, must-read-before-you-die category.In Walden, Thoreau has used the pronoun \u2018I\u2018 very often. I see a very deep meaning in it. Only when we are truthful can we can say, \u2018I am doing this, and this\u2019. It is a clear sign of experimenting instead of playing with words, which most of us do. It is very easy to say \u2018You\u2019 because then the buck passes from myself, and I can easily say, \u2018People should do like this and that\u2019 .At times, tears come out of my eyes when I think of Walden and Thoreau. I thank Mother Nature for Thoreau and Walden.",

                "reviewText": "Il libro \u00e8 arrivato in ottime condizioni!Questo libro nasce da un esperimento sociale di David Thoreau, che visse per due anni isolato dal resto del mondo per dimostrare che l'uomo possa vivere completamente alienato dalla societ\u00e0. In realt\u00e0 all'interno ci sono due scritti \"Walden\" (che prende il nome dai Walden Woods, dei boschi in Massachusetts), che per l'appunto racconta di questo esperimento sociale e \"Civil Disobedience\", un saggio dove si discute la relazione tra i governi e i cittadini.Sicuramente vale la pena leggere questi scritti perch\u00e9, nonostante siano risalienti alla prima met\u00e0 del XIX secolo, presentano degli argomenti ancora molto validi nel rapporto tra stato e cittadini nelle societ\u00e0 moderna.",
