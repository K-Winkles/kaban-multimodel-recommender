With a 19-year-old Marine Lance Corporal Kevin Cahill and others like him who showed bravery to fight for their life, survival and the country. It's a remarkable story of bravery that a lot of our military men have sacrificed their life for, it's a well written account and so heartwarming and a great way to commemorate those people who have fought for the country. Its very vivid storytelling will take you to the jungles of Vietnam, which makes us, the reader of the story, cherish the life we have now. We should honour our fallen heroes and those who have served in the military by letting them tell their stories and then be there for them. It's not easy living with the things they have seen and experienced.",

                "reviewText": "I have read hundreds of the Viet Nam war books mainly non-fiction. The Lions of Medina has to be among the top five. It's a true to life account of a Company of Marines who just about had no chance of survival in a very intense firefight with NVA regulars and Viet Cong sappers. Many Marines were killed, and much more were wounded most severely wounded. It was a perfect ambush by the NVA. Yet the Company survived after reinforcements and retreat of NVA forces. The Marine Company today still has a reunion each year. The personal lives of the men before and after the War was also particularly moving.",

                "reviewText": "Despite reading many, many war memoirs as a hobby over the past 40 years, I had never heard of Operation Medina in the Vietnam War. I'm glad I ran across this book. Not having been written by a Marine who was there, it's perhaps not a true \"memoir\" but it's a well researched account that honors the sacrifices made, and includes many excerpts from the Grunts who fought the battle.Many memoirs follow a similar format for their storytelling but occasionally I'll discover one that does it differently. Although I don't mind the more traditional format, switching it up occasionally is a nice change of pace. This one definitely breaks the mold and takes a different path, but it's well written, organized & is easy to follow.IIf you've interested in the Vietnam War, the USMC, or the military in general, or you're just a patriotic American, I highly recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cLions of Medina\u201d by Doyle Glass is a detailed and well-researched account of one of the lesser-known operations in the US-Vietnamese war. Glass delves deep into the lives of all concerned, giving a clear picture of their background and personalities. The account also details the misinformed decisions made by superiors and the extreme circumstances the soldiers on the ground found themselves in.Two things that I was not so happy with were firstly, the editing, which could have been a little tighter. Secondly, I am not in favour of any glorification of war. Not being an American national, I have no personal national pride involved and am more concerned that accounts that glorify any type of war convey a very false impression and can play into nationalist and racist stereotypes even if this is unintentional. Nevertheless, for fans of military history, this is a worthwhile read.",
