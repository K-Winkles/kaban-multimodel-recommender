It is graphic form, short vignettes on personal lived experience of autistic people dealing with issues such as gender identity, ableism, masking to fit in and the costs of that, being misunderstood, reconnecting with neurodivergent identity and being unapologetically autistic, advocacy and self-actuallization...it's all there!! I am the parent of an autistic teen and while I couldn't get her to read all of it (she is allergic to any of my recs, LOL), I sent her pics of ones I thought she would definitely relate to and she was definitely surprised to see someone get it right...we need more books like this.

                "reviewText": "First off, I'm definitely buying a physical copy of this book when it comes out. I have a similar compendium of gay comics and this compendium of autistic comics is its perfect twin. While I don't have the diagnosis, I strongly identify with pretty much all the experiences, concepts, and behaviors expressed in this book. I was so delighted to learn that how self-diagnosis is accepted by most of the community...and horrified to learn about the origins of \"Asperger's\"! I found the Tips for Autistic Adult Life to be very helpful, and the concept of Autistic Burnout to be the best description and explanation of my sensory overload tantrums. I'm amazed at how one book has managed to be entertaining, humorous, cute, informative, and inspiring all at once. I can only hope this book will be as interesting to allistic readers as it is to the autistic community!",

Both of my kids, boy and a girl, are on the spectrum ... as a parent you sometimes don't understand your kid ... and visual art - comic - is such a fine way to translate feelings and thoughts into life ...Seeing first hand, that you're not alone in this.So ... Bex Ollerton - thank you. :)",
