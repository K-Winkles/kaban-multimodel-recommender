It wasn't manageable on any level, and horrible things happened to people and horses. I couldn't put this book down, it grabbed me from the very beginning since our Hero Gunner had the same coltish bad boy personality as our three year old Morgan has now, including the one blue eye. (They aren't just for paint horses anymore!) I have also showed paints and pintos back in the day, so I related so much to the story of Gunner and his family. Gut wrenching story, and tears flowed--- An unforgetable story....",
