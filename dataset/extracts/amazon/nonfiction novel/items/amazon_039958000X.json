Fans of the musical looking for a bit more history and a little less embellishment without a history book feel will love this adaptation. The real story doesn't match musical fiction and while the life of someone like Hamilton can never entirely fit into a graphic novel, this one hits the right high points and captures the essence of the man along with great art.",

                "reviewText": "A creative and educational graphic novel, Alexander Hamilton: The Graphic History of An American Founding Father presents an interesting look at this enigmatic figure who helped shape the nation. The book follows the life of Alexander Hamilton from his days as a clerk in St. Croix to his joining of the American Revolution to his service as Secretary of Treasury. It also covers his private and public scandals, from his extramarital affair to his duel with Aaron Burr. However, it takes a while to get into as there\u2019s some confusing time-jumping in the beginning. And at times author Jonathan Hennessey tries to cram in too much information and a biblical allegory that doesn\u2019t really advance the plot. Also, the artwork by Justin Greenwood is pretty bland and some of the characters are indistinguishable from each other. Still, the panel layouts are rather creative and there\u2019s some nice texture to the backgrounds. Alexander Hamilton: The Graphic History of An American Founding Father has some problems, but overall it\u2019s an impressive biography.",
