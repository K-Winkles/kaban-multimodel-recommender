It was presented in an unfolding manner which led your thinking logically so you could try to participate in the diagnoses. Many of these cases stumped the first doctors on a case and required referrals, and in some cases a serendipitous previous experience of a doctor solved the puzzle. Its format resembles that of 'Minute Mysteries' that were popular years ago.",

These cover the roughly 5% of diagnoses that are difficult for doctors to make, simply because they are rare or have unusual presentations. For a person with no understanding of medical terminology, this book would be quite interesting because the author defines terms clearly. If the reader does have some knowledge of medical terminology, the explanations become redundant. Would not recommend for people in the medical field. The book would be enjoyed by people who enjoy medical shows on TV.",

                "reviewText": "The author, herself a physician, presents cases with unusually diagnoses, in language lay person like myself can understand. She discusses the patients' symptoms and the effects they have, detrimentally, on the patients. The reader of her book is absorbed with the patients as people and and with their medical and lifestyle problems.There is the story of a patient with symptoms doctors can't explain. Many diseases are ruled out, even Lyme's disease. But it turns out patient does indeed have a tick-borne disease, one that is not susceptible to the medication that treats Lyme's disease, which medication she had been put on. In fact, the patient had Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, from a different species of tick.Another patient with a myriad of symptoms that baffled doctors for a while turned out to have Schnitzler syndrome, wherein macrophages go wild and tell the body to act like it's infected. An expensive drug was available to treat it, but the patient's insurance company wouldn't pay for it. The doctor appealed to the drug manufacturer, which thereupon provided the drug to the patient for free. The patient then became symptom free.Another patient wound up having Lemierre's syndrome. It's a rare infection that was very fatal before antibiotics. Even now, with antibiotics, it's 18 percent fatal. It's caused by a strep throat going awry. It took month, but this patient recovered completely. There's a message from this case : take strep throat seriously.There can be serious side effects from prescribed medications. One patient was on allopurinol for gout. She developed an allergic reaction that affected the kidneys. She was on dialysis for weeks. The gout medication was stopped. The patient then rapidly improved.Another patient turned out to have a disease from flying squirrels. It was endemic typhus, a rare bacterial disease. Once diagnosed and treated, the patient recovered.A patient with mystifying symptoms was determined to have hereditary angioedema, a genetic anomaly . She was treated with steroids to prevent the swelling caused by the disease.Another patient developed symptoms that included tingling, numbness and an irregular heart beat. Turns out the patient had cinguatera poisoning from a barracuda fish he ate. The toxin therefrom came from organisms that grow on reef algae in some tropical waters. Cooking doesn't destroy the toxin. The symptoms can persist for months, even years. I only eat fish from cold water, fish such as cod,haddock, flounder, sole.In another case, s young woman with a medical problem that defied diagnosis, died. Her organs were donated. The recipient of her liver died within days of receiving the liver transplant. Turns out the dead donor had a rare genetic defect and was missing an enzyme that breaks down proteins and thereby allows ammonia to build up with fatal conclusions.A patient presented with pain,fever, and inflammation. She had familial Mediterranean fever, which caused malformed proteins. White blood cells overreacted. The patient was put on the medication colchicine,which prevents most attacks. The patient takes this medication regularly. I assume for life.Another baffling set of symptoms in another patient turned out to be Whipple's disease, caused by a bacterium. The patient was on antibiotics for more than a year. The patient was able to stop using a wheelchair, then able to put aside a walker, and even be able to walk without a cane -- but not far.And so it goes, one medical mystery after another in this compendium of interesting and challenging medical cases. I was enthrall despite my lack of a medical background. I love good detective stories, including medical ones. I recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "I had read 'Every Patient Tells a Story' and loved it so much that I distributed some copies to my friends. Having watched House, M.D., where the diagnosis is made when the patient is almost dying, I found these case histories are not much different. All are rare ailments which are not outright thought by the doctors. True, but in almost all cases, the patient s have been seen by a handful of different specialists, subjected to too many harmful investigations, before the diagnosis is made. Doesn't reflect competency of our physicians history taking and clinical skills. I was especially upset when a 94 year old lady with a history of vomitting, having one kidney removed, who was obviously dehydrated but her sodium was low was subjected to a highly dangerous procedure of contrast dye CT abdomen. She also had history of hypertension. Age, a single kidney, hypertension were all great risk factors for throwing her into contrast dye nephropathy. Why do so when serum sodium was already found low. The book could have been more interesting if Lisa Sanders also included patients coming in with common diseases with uncommon presentation. I am getting a gut feeling that the author was pushed by the publisher to write another book as fast as she could.",

Obscure vocabulary is always explained including its relevance to the diagnostic process. Columnists work with the discipline of brevity. My only observation is that in the context of a book, there is more scope for developing tension. It often felt like the resolution came just a little too soon before I got really concerned for the patient.",

The style of the writing carries you along and I had cut short one afternoon so that I could get back to carry on reading. I only wish it was much, much longer. I read it on Kindle so I can't estimate how many pages it had. All the medical mysteries were explained as the medics got to grips with the various tests, without being overly complicated for the lay person. I will have to seek out any other titles from this author.",
