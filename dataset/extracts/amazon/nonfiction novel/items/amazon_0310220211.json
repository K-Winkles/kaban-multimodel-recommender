BUT, to read the events of the bible as a story is a wonderful way of seeing the bible and God's continuing love and redemptive work in progress. You see the reality of Man/Israel's continual fall from grace and God's unwavering and unmerited patience and grace.Yes the bible tells all this but most frequently we dip into just parts of it for lessons or even if we read it through from beginning to end the books are not structured chronologically so it can be difficult to see the story unfolding.Anyway I thought it great",

Wangerin here retells the stories in his very own, unique way and I must admit he had my total attention throughout. I simply thought these were very well done; better, in fact, than the laborious read of the original text.Top marks to Wangerin for this. Absolutely loved it and no doubt will be reading it for a second time very soon. Five stars easily.I hope you find my review helpful",
