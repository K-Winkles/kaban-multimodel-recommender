But for a while after you\u2019re gone, I see you everywhere. Every ragged young person sitting huddled on a pavement, every stretched-out body under cardboard in a shop doorway.Two parents stand by powerlessly as their only child seems intent on destroying herself. As the mother\u2014a novelist\u2014attempts to understand her daughter, she finds herself revisiting her own uneasy, unresolved relationship with her mother. Weaving between childhoods past and present, laced with temptation and betrayal, Nonfiction: A Novel is an unflinching account of a mother, daughter, wife, and author reckoning with the world around her. But can a writer ever be trusted with the truth of her own story?Clear-eyed, lacerating, and fearless, Julie Myerson\u2019s Nonfiction: A Novel explores maternal love as an emotional foundation to both crave and fear.

This writer is bluntly honest and brings out the very real challenges and exhausting pain that are a part of the disease of addiction. This book also explores the many confusing aspects of human relationships and manages through very creative and insightful writing to also bring to light uplifting strengths and true kindnesses that are also born within when human pain is understood rather than judged. I highly recommend this book AND feel it's desperately needed for all USA readers too!",

An unnamed narrator, an author, tells her story and that of her drug addicted daughter in a way that feels like one long confession of doubt and generational trauma. The narrator had a fraught relationship with her own mother and over the years has questioned how she deals with her child. Myerson, who previously wrote about her son's addition, has turned the situation on its head to proclaim that this is fiction and then titled it Nonfiction. Except the details are so real. Thanks to netgalley for the arc. A painful one.",
