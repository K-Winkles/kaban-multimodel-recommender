The violence was hard to see and read, but I felt that it was necessary. The men in her life add to the arc of the story. This is the story of what is happening to women in Iran.

                "reviewText": "Book ReviewSatrapi, M. (2007) The complete Persepolis. New York, NY: Pantheon Books. After reading Marjane Satrapi\u2019s graphic memoir, Persepolis, I believe it is in the best interests of our students to add the book to our available reading list. Persepolis is Satrapi\u2019s account of growing up during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) that almost immediately followed the Iranian Revolution (1979). Satrapi is an Iranian woman who left Iran to attend high school in Vienna, later returned to Iran to marry, and eventually moved to France where she wrote Persepolis. The memoir serves as a bildungsroman for Satrapi, covering her life as she leaves primary school and enters high school; we see Satrapi grappling with the woman she wants to become in light of where she comes from. Persepolis also serves as a piece of literary historical non-fiction because the backdrop of Satrapi\u2019s coming of age is amidst a pivotal point in Iranian (and Iraqi) history, and this history is central to the plot line of Satrapi\u2019s memoir. Persepolis has also won a fair share of awards. It was a New York Times notable book, Times Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest Comix of the Year\u201d (2004), and a best-seller across the country. The book, originally written in French, was adapted into film, and the film version won the Cannes Jury Prize, the C\u00e9sar award for best writing, the C\u00e9sar award for the best first feature film, and the Sutherland trophy. The film adaptation was also nominated for an Academy Award for best animated feature film. Despite the accolades both the film and graphic memoir received, Persepolis is in the top 10 of the American Library Association\u2019s 2014 \u201cFrequently Challenged Books\u201d list. The ALA informs us that the rationales that have been provided for banning the book include gambling, offensive language, and its political viewpoint. The ALA also says that Persepolis has been called \u201cpolitically, racially, and socially offensive\u201d and that it has \u201cgraphic depictions.\u201d There is truth to these claims. Persepolis takes place as Satrapi grows up amidst the Iran-Iraq war. War, by its very nature, brings about political viewpoints that some students and their parents may disagree with. The book also contains offensive language, and portrays the ramifications of war and includes \u201cgraphic depictions\u201d as a result. The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) in its guidelines on \u201cThe Students\u2019 Right to Read\u201d (2012), argues, \u201cLiterature about ethnic or racial minorities remain \u2018controversial\u2019 or \u2018objectionable\u2019 to many adults\u2026. \u201cThough nominally, the criticisms of racial or ethnic literature have usually been directed at \u2018bad language, \u2018suggestive situations,\u2019 \u2018questionable literary merit,\u2019 or \u2018ungrammatical English,\u2019 the underlying motive for some attacks has unquestionably been racial.\u201d Using the coded language the NCTE provides, we can see that the reasons given to the ALA as evidence supporting a book ban and/or challenge appear racial. The complaints do not say, \u201cWe should ban this book because it is about an Iranian woman,\u201d but the codes found in words like \u201coffensive\u201d point to a racially-based book ban. This kind of censorship is inappropriate and unfair to our students, who deserve to have historical events contextualized in multiple forms (movies, graphic novels, novels, short stories, documentaries, and art to name a few forms) and to have students from multiple cultures represented in texts. English Language Arts programs is, \u201c\u2026not one instructional resource, but many; not one curriculum objective, but several\u201d (Guidelines for selection of materials in English language arts programs, 2014). The use of Satrapi\u2019s text allows for many objectives to be met simultaneously:1. It is historical non-fiction, which allows it to be taught as an informational text rather than as literature. It is also naturally interdisciplinary, which allows for and encourages complementary teaching across Social Studies and English Language Arts classes.2. It is beautifully written. Even though it is classified as an informational text, many of the literary devices English Language Arts teachers long to discuss can still be discussed.3. As a graphic narrative, it can be taught to students who read at a wide range of Lexile levels. Visual learners will also benefit. Its graphic form also allows it to become a \u201chigh-interest\u201d text when it probably wouldn\u2019t be in other circumstances4. As a historical narrative covering the Iran-Iraq War from the perspective of an Iranian woman, it meets the Common Core Standard for \u201cdiverse cultures.\u201d5. As a memoir written by a woman, it allows educators to disrupt the male-centered curriculum so often seen in classrooms across the country6. Persepolis can easily be included in a text set with other texts. It can be used in a unit on war, the Iran-Iraq War specifically, women in the Middle East, women\u2019s rights, and fights for freedom.Depending on the instructional context used by the instructor, Persepolis can meet many curriculum needs simultaneously, while widening the worldview of American-centric readers. In schools with high populations of immigrants and refugees, Persepolis helps provide a face that is often much more like theirs in a sea of literature dominated by dead white men. As with any highly-challenged book, it is probably always a good idea to send parents a permission slip in advance that provides them with 1) an opportunity for their student to do an alternate assignment instead 2) a rationale for why you believe the text is worthy of study and 3) reasons why the book is challenged. It\u2019s certainly possible that parents will balk at the idea of their children reading a book that some consider \u201coffensive,\u201d but I have faith that with simple explanations and the ability to change their mind, the vast majority of your students will be able to read texts as important as Persepolis.",

I really felt what I would have felt going through her experiences.I am not Persian / Iranian. At the time the Shah left \"for vacation \", I had a job offer to teach in Tehran. I had been introduced to my serious boyfriend's father and been \"approved.\" I was learning Farsi, loved the language and culture. In 2978-79, Tehran was still considered the \"Paris of the Middle East.\" The culture was very westernized with western world values. The culture crackled with life, night life, fashion, dance and music, arts, and singers like Dariush, and Farhad. Yes, Persians were ( are) religious at that time, but similitude to Americans now, religion was more how you lived your life, it didn't dominate your life by force or cult.Marjane takes me back to that overwhelming and confusing time in my life. Her book for me, picks up just after I ended my marriage plans with my boyfriend and we went our own ways.She is helping me to close an old chapter.Separately, her first psges talk about her feeling a calling to be a Prophet. While I didn't want to be a prophet, I too had a strong spiritual calling from maybe age five (?), and neither of my parents were overly religious. My mom liked to practice her singing, so she went to church. My father cut grass. His \"god\" was the lawnmower.Maybe one day I will interview Marjane. For sure, I would love to meet her and thank her for writing such an important- and culturally healing - book.I am recommending her book to other Persians I know of, some were asylum seekers.",
