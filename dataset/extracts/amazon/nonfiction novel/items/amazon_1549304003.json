                "reviewText": "Bought this book because it keeps showing up on banned book lists and had to know what it is about. I ended up reading it in one sitting. The story is engaging and I think the author does an excellent job at conveying concepts that are often hard to give voice to, even now when the language around gender has expanded.I'm not sure why people are complaining about the \"mature\" content of this book, especially given that this book is intended for high school and older aged readers (rated for 14+). Yes, there's some awkward life moments depicted in the comic but life is awkward. This isn't a young adult fantasy novel where parallels to current societal anxieties are carefully hidden behind allegories. This is a autobiographical story about one person's journey on the path of self discovery and acceptance. For some of us this is a story we sorely needed when we were younger as it would have let us know that we were not alone and for others it is an educational journey about a life perspective completely different from one's own.What I truly cherish about this story, though, is that it is free from the typical trauma porn that LGBTQ+ stories marketed towards the mainstream have. This story is about a person from a relatively well-meaning albeit sometimes clueless family unit (with some positive exceptions). The lack of external antagonists (whether they be societal or inter-personal), allows the narrative to focus on what is most important - the author's personal journey.",

Clearly the people against it (and other banned books) had not actually read them.I did not want to be like them, so I looked for this on Amazon and found it free to read with my Unlimited subscription.I am very glad to have read it and highly recommend it. I shows a perspective of life that many are unfamiliar with. We need to be open to other ways of looking at life. Accepting.Maia was fun and reminded me of many of my students when I taught 8th grade. I always tried to respect them and expected them to respect each other and themselves.Back to the banning issue.I can see how many young people NEED to read this book. They have questions, issues, feelings that need to be addressed. They need to know that they are not alone and that there is hope for a happy life.Adults need to read this and remember how it was when we were their age. And how we must be prepared to protect the you g as they mature and not damage them.This book is not pornography. It deals with adult issues in a matter of fact way which makes some people uncomfortable. Perhaps they need to be aware that THEY make people uncomfortable as well.PS - If someone asks that they be addressed in a certain way be respectful and honor their wishes.Read everyday and read for fun!",

More than one of the images is quite gruesome and will provide a shock if your not mature enough or one who is sensitive to violent images. The same goes for the sexually explicit ones too.That said, my strongest warning goes more to the underlying story of a suffering soul who essentially -according to the author- was raised without boundaries and appears to have been left alone to try and understand childhood and adolescence -I also suffered the same fate having been a child of a Hippie in the 1960s.Although his actual experience may have been different, to really read book SLOWLY it became apparent to my mind he grew to despise his deepest self in a never ending attempt to flee his natural being... again, that's MY take on the book. Repeat SLOWLY as the comic book format is misleading.If your buying this for a young man or woman who is profoundly uncomfortable with who they are, I would advise reading it yourself first and then make sure to stay close to them in order to understand the enormous dark undertakings it attempts to inspire.",
