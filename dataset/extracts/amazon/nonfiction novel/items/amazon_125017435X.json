In this graphic novel, investigate one of America's oldest and most intriguing mysteries.Over a hundred years before the pilgrims, the very first English settlers arrived on Roanoke Island. But without warning, these colonists abandoned their new home and disappeared without a trace.What happened to the colonists? To figure it out, we\u2019ll need to investigate how these missing settlers got to Roanoke in the first place, and what the people already living there thought about these strange foreigners. It\u2019s a case filled with brutal battles, perilous pirate ships, ruthless queens, scheming businessmen, and enough skeletons to fill a graveyard. Read more",

I used to be concerned about my child\u2019s graphic novel preference until I did more research and learned there is a lot going on and it isn\u2019t just watered down reading.)

I know very little about the Lost Colony and wanted to brush up on my history as well as preview the book before I handed it to my daughter.My one quibble would be with the author\u2019s use of slightly crass humor - in one comic, Manteo, the more clownish narrator, is reviewing a scene from his past and jokingly lifts the back of his loin cloth to check out his butt. No butts are shown, but it\u2019s just needless juvenile humor.In another scene, Sir Walter Raleigh is called \u201cthe sexiest man\u201d alive\u2026 really don\u2019t want to have to explain to my 8 year old what \u201csexiness\u201d is.As far as some reviewers saying that this portrays the country in a negative light, I don\u2019t agree. The English Colonists we\u2019re not saints, and they weren\u2019t even Americans, so there\u2019s no need to get ruffled over discussing their real faults and missteps.",
