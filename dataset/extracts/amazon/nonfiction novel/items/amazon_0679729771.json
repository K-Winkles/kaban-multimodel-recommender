So I gave them my copy, bought them Volume 1 to go along with it, then bought another set for myself, and one for a friend. I don't read a lot of books due to impatience and attention-span issues, but this book was no problem. It's told from the viewpoint of a busy middle-class family hadn't paid much attention to politics. They then got run over by the insane ego of a dictator. Yes, of course it could happen here.",

                "reviewText": "In my readings of WWII of the fighting on the Eastern Front I also have read the books of Mazower telling of the Germans desire to expand the Eastern frontier in the concept of Lebensraum. In the starting of WWII with the attack on Poland is where the first book in this series started with Vladek Spiegelman on his odyssey of what it was to be a Jew under the governance of Nazi rule. In the first book we learn of the progressive pogroms utilized to ostracize and segregate the Jewish community. We see this happening in a gradual and degrading way. At first their property is taken from them and they lose their jobs and professions. After this is done they are relegated to the most menial of tasks. It still amazes me that Germany spent so much of their resources both in materials and personnel to try to exterminate a culture of people. These resources should have been used to try to win the war. Such was the hatred of the corrupt Nazi government. In Art Spiegelman's second book we see how it was to live in these concentration camps which in the end murdered over six million Jews. How there were survivors is in of itself a miracle. I have read the diaries of Victor Klemperer and Mazower's books of the Eastern front and there was discussion of the concentration camps but really no memoirs of actual survivors. What Art Spiegelman has done in these two volumes of graphic depictions is nothing short of incredible. It shows as a testimony to the resourcefulness and iron will of Vladek Spiegelman to endure these deprivations of starvation and true cruelty. The result of his knowing English helped him to survive by friending a Polish kampa who looked out for his interests and kept him out of harm's way. The creativity of learning the ins and outs of the culture of the concentration camp helped him to survive. The author shows us the story as he was recording these stories for this book. However the other story which is expertly interweaved in the book is how Vladek was living his life in Rego Park Queens. He shows us a thrifty person who finds it hard to part with his money and who is always complaining about his gold digging second wife. Always complaining as he goes on to tell of what it was to live, die and above all survive under the auspices of Nazi Germany. If you read one book on the lives of people in such places as Auschwitz this is the one to read!!!",

                "reviewText": "After reading the first book (Maus) by Mr. Spiegelman, I rushed to get Maus II. His use of cartoon animals to retell the stories related to him by his father who survived the horrors of being a Jew in Europe during WWII is at the same time compelling and captivating. Other books have explained these events in equally gruesome detail, but the first person nature of the tales created a personalized accounting of the worst of humankind and at the same time the astounding spirit of Mr. Spiegelman's father in the face of unspeakable inhumanity.Perhaps one of the more poignant elements in the book was the recurrent theme of Mr. Spiegelman's frustration with his father's behaviors, which I know will ring true with many readers. It took me time to partially understand my own father's mindset as we discussed his military experience in WWII, so it was particularly relatable for me.I wish I were more facile with words to describe the effect of using cartoon animals in telling the story. The medium Mr. Spiegelman employed drew me into the story and kept me reading, in spite of being repulsed by the unconscionable behavior of the camp guards and overseers toward these innocent people. Just suffice to say that the books were difficult to lay down, and I'll likely read them a few more times over the years.Highly recommended, award winning expositions of the worst (and best) of humanity.",

The descriptions are not graphic and I believe that children should know this history.",

                "reviewText": "For me, reading this graphic novel was a way to see into the past and glimpse the horrors of Nazi Germany from the perspective of a Jewish family torn apart. The author, Art Spiegelman, did a fantastic job in his portrayal of the characters, bringing his father's story of survival to life. Credit to my university English prof for putting this on the recommended reading list. This book set is a unique portrait and I would recommend it for most.",

                "reviewText": "It's a work of art. How Spiegelman sketches out absolutely heart wrenching scenes keeping true to the character forms he has built...Jews are the 'Maus', Germans the Cats and Poles the Pigs...lot of reviews have been written about these 2 books and I agree with all that has been written. As much a brilliant account of the most hateful act of WW2 as it a graphic novel lover's delight!",

                "reviewTitle": "A harrowing, emotional journey \u2013 a story that needed to be told",
                "reviewText": "(Review covers Maus I and Maus II).In the 1980s, Art Spiegelman\u2019s father, Vladek, recounts to him his life: growing up in Poland in the early 1900s, meeting and marrying his wife Anja, World War 2. In particular Vladek details his life as a Jew under the yoke of Nazi Germany: the harsh treatment, the concentration camps, the deaths he saw at the hands of the Nazis and what he did to survive. This is Vladek\u2019s life story.An incredibly interesting and emotional graphic novel. Biographical in that it tells the story of the author\u2019s father\u2019s life during WW2 \u2013 an incredibly harrowing ordeal. It highlights the atrocities experienced by Jews in Nazi Germany and how cheaply the Nazis valued their lives.It also shows just how resourceful one had to be to survive and even then you had to be lucky. Vladek is incredibly resourceful but that only gets you so far.Furthermore, Vladek\u2019s life and the book show that it doesn\u2019t end with WW2 as Vladek\u2019s demons stay with him to his death. His experiences in Auschwitz and the like affect his relationships and how he goes about his everyday life. Incredibly emotional in that respect.",
