                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dusting Off a Little Known Vignette of Military History",
                "reviewText": "In the long history of war we have many instances of minorities who are treated many times as less than second class citizens. This is very inherent in the imperial armies of the French in Indo-China and Northern Africa and the British all around the world where the sun never set on its Empire. Such anomalies were in existence in all of the United States Armed Forces throughout the late 18th and the entire 19th century and half of the 20th century. During this time frame the black men of these times served in the military very often times as support troops doing menial tasks very much like slaves prior to the Civil War. During the 19th century we see for the first time that blacks were used in the Indian Wars of the West and were given the name of Buffalo Soldiers. This piece of historical fiction is based on factual material written by Max Brooks and illustrated in black and white by Caanan White which gives us a detail account that many Americans have no knowledge of. This being the centennial of the start of WWI, we are also given an education of a black 369th Regiment from New York. The fact that this unit was one of the first American units to be deployed to France and the French at this time were in desperate need of fresh combat troops to be the needed fodder to fight the German Hun, we see the 369th fighting not with other American units but rather the French. At this time in American history the American army would not use a black regiment to fight in any combat arm during WWI. However the French needed bodies and for them the color of the skin did not matter. Brooks shows the frustrations and the injustices that the black soldiers had to endure. What the author also brings to the table is that this regiment was one of the most decorated of all the units in WWI. It endured the most time of all American units on the combat line. If you go to Harlem today you can visit the 369th Regiment Armory and see a monument of the Harlem Hellfighters so named by their German adversaries on the Fields of Flanders. This book gives a wonderful history of this unit and is an enduring story which should be imbedded into American Military History.",

                "reviewText": "We don't know what we are capable of.Woodrow Wilson knew what would happen if black soldiers returned from Europe victorious, having made the world \"safe for democracy.\"The Harlem Hellfighters fought a double war: they fought the terrifying war against the Germans, and they fought the insinuating, sly racist oppression of their own president, Woodrow Wilson. Wilson was an uncloseted democrat racist, and his appointees understood that the black soldiers had to be sternly repressed, or else they might succeed.The book is excellent in its depiction of different social classes and accents, especially in the beginning of the bok where the recruitment is shown. At times it is difficult to figure out who is who as the people are being blown to bits, but usually the next frame calls out the name of the deceased, so you can figure it out.Black and white graphics, a lot (a LOT) of bodily fluids, and people being blown to smithereens.The book does show the sickening racism against these soldiers by dishonorable democrat politicians, like Mayor John F Floyd and Woodrow Wilson himself. And of course, it looks at the soldier's feelings of bitterness, resentment, and the desire for violent revenge that arose from their treatment. You see a race riot on page 39.The book offers good historical quotes: from WEB DuBois on page 77, from Irvin S. Cobb on page 124, and the Alan Seeger poem \"I have a Rendezvous with Death.\" There is a great discussion on page 175 on dignity and respect, and an excellent summary of what these men overcame. The graphics offer very good sensory information, and one of the best visual tricks involves \"remembering.\" Great presentation of the graphics. As a parent, I highly recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not really a big fan of graphic novels, but I bought this for my husband - who loves comic books & history, seemed like a perfect fit. I love history so I read it too. The topic is really interesting - the Harlem Hellfighters, a little known group of black soldiers from World war I (I specifically did not use African American - because some of the men were from Caribbean islands). The story is very gritty and it focuses mostly on the racial issues of the time period and the race issues faced by the soldiers - which left a lot of the war story untold. I learned a great deal, but at times I felt like the story was demonizing all white people and in some ways diminishing the heroic actions of the black soldiers by implying their only motivation was to kill white people. The book does do a tremendous job of showing the ugly side of war, the horrible conditions and the brutality of combat. I really like the concept of using graphic novels to teach about history, but I wish this book was a bit more balanced in its approach.",

Bellissimi i disegni di White e anche i testi di Brooks meritano. Consigliatissimo agli amanti del periodo storico purch\u00e9 abbiano padronanza dell'inglese.Amazing WWI comic book, Harlem Hellfighters story is worth telling, a story made of war, heroism and discrimation. I can't believe they were forbidden to serve in the US Army because black, however they proved their valor on the battlefield. Highly recommended to WWI fans, White and Brooks did a great job !",
