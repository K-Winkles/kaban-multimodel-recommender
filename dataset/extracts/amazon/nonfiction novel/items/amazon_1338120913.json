                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars An Engrossing Tale of Courage and Survival",
                "reviewText": "I recently picked up \"I Survived The Sinking of the Titanic, 1912\" for my 12-year-old son, but I couldn't resist delving into the book myself. As a history enthusiast, I was immediately captivated by Lauren Tarshis' vivid storytelling and the gripping plot centered around one of history's most tragic events.From the moment I started reading, I found myself transported back in time to the luxurious yet ill-fated RMS Titanic, the \"unsinkable\" ship that met its tragic end in the icy waters of the Atlantic. The author masterfully weaves together a tale of young George, a courageous 10-year-old boy who finds himself aboard this iconic vessel.Tarshis expertly balances historical accuracy with an engaging narrative, making this book both educational and highly entertaining. The details of the ship's opulence, the diverse cast of characters, and the suspenseful build-up to the disaster were all brilliantly portrayed. The author's ability to empathetically depict the struggle for survival amidst chaos and panic is truly commendable.What sets this book apart is its accessibility to younger readers. The language is straightforward and age-appropriate, making it an excellent choice for children looking to immerse themselves in history. Additionally, the inclusion of a glossary at the end helps young readers better understand unfamiliar terms.\"I Survived The Sinking of the Titanic, 1912\" handles the tragedy with sensitivity, never shying away from the harsh realities faced by the passengers, yet maintaining a suitable level of sensitivity for a young audience. It highlights important lessons of resilience, bravery, and the power of the human spirit in the face of adversity.My only minor criticism is that, at times, it felt like the story rushed through certain events. I would have appreciated a bit more depth in exploring the aftermath of the sinking. However, I understand the need to maintain a balance between historical accuracy and the pacing of a children's book.In conclusion, \"I Survived The Sinking of the Titanic, 1912\" is a captivating and educational read that brings the historical event to life through the eyes of a young protagonist. It is a perfect choice for children interested in history or looking to learn about the Titanic disaster in an engaging way. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "{My thoughts} \u2013 George, his sister and his aunt are all on board the Titanic on the night it hits an iceberg and sinks. This graphic novel is a wonderful depiction of the original I Survived book that Lauren Tarshis wrote for children and middle grade. As I read through this book it was easy to recall the original book. A lot of the text is the same and or similar. The illustrations help to give you an idea of what the illustrator was seeing when they\u2019d imagined the world in which the book was envisioned for. I have to admit it\u2019s pretty spot on to what I thought as I\u2019d read the original book in which it is based.My only complaint is that the text seems kind of small and could potentially be hard for some individuals to read. Otherwise, it is pure perfection and I look forward to reading the rest of the series as they release as graphic novels!I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys graphic novels and historical fiction. It is well worth the time spent reading it!",
