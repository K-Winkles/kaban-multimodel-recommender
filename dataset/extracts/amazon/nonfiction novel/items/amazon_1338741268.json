In particular it's nice to see a book that doesn't lean into the stereotype of cheerleaders as evil, nasty people that has become such a cliche nowadays.Meanwhile, note that the 1-star reviewers (as of the time I write this) are lying. Not only is there no anti-Christian hate in this book or anything that could honestly be construed as such, but the author speaks appreciatively of her experiences attending Christian church growing up. ... she also attended services at a Buddhist temple, however, and as a child positively compared the social messages of Jesus and the Buddha and wondered if it was really necessary to choose between them. So now you know where the 1-star reviewers are coming from ... I would encourage everyone to report false reviews, as they violate the terms of service.",

This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)The Tryout is a book that not only balances the racism that breaks my heart - especially for middle grade readers - but also the joy in embracing ourselves. In knowing where we come from, celebrating our home, and what makes us different. The Tryout examines this quintessential middle grade experience which I'm not sure we ever grow out of - the pressure to fit in. To try to fit ourselves in a mold of what people want can require a price. A way in which we betray ourselves, the ones we love, and more.",
