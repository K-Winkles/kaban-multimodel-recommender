                "reviewText": "I am generally not impressed with graphic novels but The Black Panther Party: A Graphic Novel History is an exception. I\u2019m impressed with both the writing and the pictures. If one read Section 2 alone, they would obtain a brief but complete history of the African American experience in America. I had some knowledge of the Black Panthers before reading this book. I met the leader of the Black Panther party section in Jersey City, New Jersey. I can say from personal experience that the police took a dim view of someone selling the Black Panther newspaper.I am quite happy to learn the entire history of the official Black Panther party. The Black Panther party believed in direct action in the streets. The book indicated that significant numbers of the party were individuals who had served time in the jails and prisons. The book clearly describes the rough edges of many party members. Even with these rough edges, they were able to work with progressive segments of the black population through their school lunch project and other activities. The book doesn\u2019t gloss over some of the violence related to fellow Panthers and the police. The black panther organization was a top-down organization in that the leaders tended to give instructions to its membership without input from that membership. In its glory days, it was feared by the police and, of course, the FBI.I wonder what the Black Panther Party would have become with a different leadership style. Even though I never joined, I was proud of the strong image of black men with their black beret and weapons. This book gives you an excellent presentation of the Black Panthers and should be part of your library of Black history.",

                "reviewText": "I love this book!!! The first thing that grabbed me was the beautiful illustration art by Marcus Kwame Anderson. His artistic translations of iconic images are warm and affectionate, and his research on period clothing, cars, and neighborhoods is so on point I felt like I was there in the visual sequences he created from oral or written accounts. I love that every single panel in this book is beautiful to look at, even when the subject matter is heartbreaking or enraging. There is so much to examine visually, I find myself going back to look again and again. The artist\u2019s line quality is just beautiful, and I loved the use color, and the production design too!The writing in this book is also excellent!! The writer, David Walker, lays out the preceding history that led to the formation of the Black Panther Party. That context really illuminates these young peoples sense of urgency and righteous indignation, and the real threats to their lives and health, and the way white supremacy and racist policy touched every part of Black people\u2019s lives, as it continues to today. Reading this book is like listening to a favorite history professor give a riveting lecture - there are many threads, many lives, many events, but he makes a cohesive narrative that a lay person can follow and understand, and get excited about. I appreciate the balance in the writing as well, all the facts are put out there, making for a well rounded, human history of the Party.This is a great book for anyone who loves history, art, comics, is interested in Civil and Human Rights, and is interested in current events as well, because this history draws a direct line to today. It should definitely be a part of every library collection and taught in high schools and universities.",

The book is well made, the graphics are very good (that's my friend's work) and the research that went into providing the text is very apparent. As a fellow writer, I know that reading a book is something that others seem to be less and less. But this is a very essential book for both young and adult readers. It provides important information about the rights of people subjected to injustice wherever they reside; it just so happens that most of the book focuses on America. I strongly encourage others, certainly primarily people of color, to prepare your favorite beverage, settle into a favorite chair and delve into this important book. It is a graphic comic book, but it still matters. 175pgs. The vendor was very dependable and the book arrived in a very timely manner.",

Lol\ud83d\ude06 it's just that awesome of a book! It takes you for a ride the moment you read it and talks about the impacting, tragic, but triumphant legacy of the BPP which still continues to this day! If you're for freedom and democracy of the realistic point of view? Then this book is for you!
