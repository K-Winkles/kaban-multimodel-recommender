I came to understand that there were many factors involved in racing that are kept from the eyes of the general population. This book exposes some behind the scenes activities that impact the outcomes of a race.This is my first attempt at reading a graphic novel. It took a few pages to adjust to the format. In the end I found it a little easier to understand the story with the inclusion of illustrations.",

                "reviewText": "I just finished reading Grand Theft Horse by G. Neri. Initially I was hesitant to read this book because I had read his previous work Yummy. I had been truly impressed with Yummy but it had left a deep impact on me. To this day I still feel that story and the life lesson it shared. I was resistant to read Grand Theft Horse because I feared that he would again force me to open my eyes to things that we as a society are comfortable being shelter from. Well yes he did it again! His book made me stop and think. All great books should do that. It makes you look at things that as a society we would prefer to ignore and be ignorant of and again he did it in such a way that like a car accident once you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it. This book is a masterpiece in writing and while parts of the story are distressing it\u2019s also tells the reader the importance of standing by ones belief. That victory\u2019s come with a cost but at the end the day one\u2019s own convictions should be our moral compass. This book is great for readers of all ages. I have already passed it on to my wife, who then passed it on to our eleven year old daughter, who then passed it on to her best friend. All of which have enjoyed the book. If you are looking for a book that the whole family will enjoy and discuss at Sunday night dinner look no further this is the book for you. Thank You G, Neri for again forcing me to open my eyes and like the hero of the story Gail Ruffu wants, through example and education we can make the world a better place!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great True Story About Heroic Woman Who Overcomes Long Odds",
                "reviewText": "This offers a new direction from the author of the moving graphic novel YUMMY, and in its own way it is nearly as powerful. Based on the true story of Gail Ruffu, the book sheds light on the abuses and seamy side of the horse racing industry. But it is also the triumphant tale of Ruffu, an unconventional trainer who employs a holistic approach and ultimately is forced to take drastic action to rescue an endangered horse named Urgent Envoy. Over many years of struggle against an \"old boy\" network that is unwilling to change its approach in spite of the unneccesary drugging and death of thousands of horses, Ruffu demonstrates courage and persistence in the face of long odds. She ultimately finds vindication and redemption and never stops trying to push for positive change advocating that those in the industry try to become \"part of the solution, not the problem.\" I found myself totally pulled into the story and rooting for this quirky, unconventional hero, and learned a ton about horses and how the racing industry works along the way. Corban Wilkin's deft illustrations are a great match for the story, offering lots of humor and charm, but also capturing the high stakes drama that revolves around the fate of Urban Envoy and his protector. This is a great read for anyone who loves horses and other animals, or and/or wants to read an exciting story about an underdog who does not give up until her voice is finally heard.",

I envy the heck out of her horse girl childhood, yet I was thinking what a hard row to hoe being an army brat in a family big enough to be a traveling village would be. And yet, something about that rough and tumble mix gave this woman incredible perseverance, unflagging loyalty and grit to face down an industry. I think even the hard parts \u2013 that having to separate from Spice left an echo in her soul that helped her go in for the long haul with Urgent Envoy. Gail is a hero, and in light of all that is coming out about the state of the racing industry this book\u2019s publication couldn\u2019t be more timely. Thanks to the whole creative team that brought this about.",
