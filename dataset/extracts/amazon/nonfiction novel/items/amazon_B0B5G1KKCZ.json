        "description": "\"This book draws all the emotions out of you. I went from tears to snorting with laughter. It was both lighthearted and heart breaking, yet it inspires me to live my best life! \" Michelle CoxWhen Hollywood auctioneer Emsley Wilson finds her famous grandmother's diary while cleaning out her New York brownstone, the pages are full of surprises. The first surprise is, the diary isn't her grandmother's. It belongs to Johanna Bonger, Vincent van Gogh's sister-in-law.Johanna inherited Vincent van Gogh's paintings. They were all she had, and they weren't worth anything. She was a 28 year old widow with a baby in the 1800s, without any means of supporting herself, living in Paris where she barely spoke the language. Yet she managed to introduce Vincent's legacy to the world.The inspiration couldn't come at a better time for Emsley. With her business failing, an unexpected love turning up in her life, and family secrets unraveling, can she find answers in the past?\"This book was so much more than I had expected, and I had high expectations... one of the most beautiful stories I've read in years.\" Kaela Stokes\"It touched something in my soul.\" Audrey McDonald Read more",

                "reviewText": "I would say that most Americans from high school on up know who Vincent Van Gogh is: The creator of some of the world\u2019s most beautiful paintings (Starry, Starry Night; Sunflowers to name a few) or the mad painter who cut off his ear and gave it to a prostitute as a sign of affection. There have been hundreds of books, movies, songs and tv shows that give readers/watchers an insight to this complicated man.But this novel gives readers a new perspective, When Vincent dies in 1890 by suicide (gunshot to the chest), he leaves his paintings to his brother, Theo, and his wife, Johanna. After Theo dies in 1891, the paintings are left to Johanna. And Johanna is the subject of this powerful novel with the theme of inspiring women.Even before Theo\u2019s death from general paresis of insane in 1891, Johanna was trying to establish Vincent reputation in the art world. True she the money that his paintings would bring, but in the 1890s, women did not have many ways to earn a living, Plus she had her son to provide for.Now then, this book takes on a dual narrative that is not quite interesting as Johanna\u2019s story, yet Johanna becomes an inspiration to Emsley Wilson, who is the fictional granddaughter of Violet Valkyrie, a woman who was also a well-known artist. Emsley lives and works in LA as a Hollywood auctioneer. Violet had Johanna\u2019s diary, which is the catalyst for the novel when Violet has her look into her blue box at the back of her closet and encourages Emsley to read it.Bottom line: It is because of Johanna\u2019s unrelenting ambition to make Vincent a household name that it is. Throw in some 2022 shenanigans from Emsley\u2019s ex-boyfriend and best friend to take her business and an unexpected romance that create such a riveting. For me, the first four chapters were rather slow, but once I started Chapter 5, I couldn\u2019t put it down. Therefore, The Secret Life of Sunflowers gets 5 out of 5 stars in Julie\u2019s world.",

His brilliance is an immortal thread of society rightfully so. This story gives us a glimpse at him as a man who was loved deeply in a way that we often only skim over. Here we see him through the eyes of his sister-in-law and brother, simultaneously with a more modern story of three generations of his great nieces and their journies. The author marries these stories well as you jump back and forth through time.",

Yes, there are a few loose ends that weren't touched on such as the fact that Theo actually died from syphilis, but overall, I was truly impressed and thoroughly enjoyed the book. I found myself looking forward to reading it and having a hard time putting it down. I highly recommend it.",

J'ai extr\u00eamement aim\u00e9 ce livre. Il se lit vite. Il est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. Il y manque seulement des photos des peintures qui sont mentionn\u00e9es.

This author has some 'chops', is spikey and can be fun, but to be taken seriously as an author of historical fiction, she needs a good editor/publishing house assistance, in my view. I hope she gets picked up by a publisher. Or that she moves on to the movie or TV series worlds where her style could soar.",
