                "reviewText": "It is quite possible that more has been written about The Holocaust than any other historical event in history. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted. John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book \"The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas\" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain \"the voice,\" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a \"telling\" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, \"Heil Hitler\" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, \"Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.\" The boy, his name Bruno; his age nine, misunderstands the key words and Auschwitz is written as \"Out-With\" every single time. The negative pun- the only way I could describe this- suggests the old work rhythm, \"In with the good; out with the bad.\" Then the boy mishears the Furher as The Fury\" and this negative pun needs no description at all. We have a moment when Bruno meets \"The Fury\" as well as \"her\" when they come for dinner and Bruno is appalled at how small The Fury is, but how kind the beautiful blonde woman with him is (her name is simply Eva). The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, \"a Night to Remember\" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Boyne uses the literary tool that his audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the novel. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, Boyne shocks us in such a way that instead of tears, our mouths are opened in the O shape that he uses to describe several characters through the book. This book is by no means a \"Sophie's Choice\" though the horror is just as shocking, but few writers in history have been able to achieve what William Styron did. Still Styron's novel and Boyne's novel use a similar foundation but their books are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like Styron's \"Sophie's Choice,\" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of \"The Boy In Striped Pajamas\" makes it impossible for this book- and the fame it will bring Mr. Boyne, you heard it here first- to become satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words. John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable\" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword: \"And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of this happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again. Not in this day and age.\"The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others. This novel is worthy of a prize. It's not a children's book, though my children should read it. It's not an adult book, but all adults should read it. This would rule out the Newbury or Caldecott. In regard to its literary merit, the American version needs some editorial work (only once did the editors miss a pajamas and leave pyjamas) but the writing is pristine and brilliant and worthy of The Pulitzer. As far as The Nobel Prize for Literature, it is worthy there too. But mostly it's is worthy of you. And, like \"Sophie's Choice\" I am told that a motion picture is in the making. Depending on whose hands it falls into this could be a miracle. The innocent eyes through which Bruno's story unfolds are critical and these innocent eyes are just as important as Sophie's guilty and lying soul. If Benton could do it, perhaps \"The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas\" will as well. But there are a lot of \"Maybes\" involved with the hopes of John Boyne, this critic and every other artist who has attempted to move us. As far as I can see, Boyne has done his part. This book, like Elie Weisel's \"Night\" needs to be published in as many languages as possible and marketed toward as many customers as possible. No one should keep this book from the hands of a nine year old nor should anyone consider it a book too young for adults. In short, this is a remarkable book in every way and perhaps, after more times has passed for thinking and another read through or so, l may well see that there is no other possible way for this story to have ended. Not in this day and age.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Tale of 2 Innocent Boys...",
                "reviewText": "The story about the son of a Nazi commandant and an innocent Jewish boy is absolutely amazing and filled with tragedy that may cause some to tear up. It talks about both perspectives from the Nazi's and the Jews in which give us a variety of ways we can view what the book is based off of: the holocaust. The book is absolutely gut wrenching, both filled with the emotional history and the bond between the two boys.The book was published on January 5, 2006 by John Boyne and is under the historical fiction genre. Bruno, the son of the Nazi commandant and his family, moves from Berlin to a residence near a concentration camp. Bruno was sad and lonely due to his lack of friends and walked behind his house where he saw a boy on the other side of a barbed wire fence. Both confused and unaware of their situation, their unlikely bond grew strong.Bruno and Shmuel (the Jewish boy) are just as confused as any kid would be. Bruno doesn't know why the fence is there or what it symbolizes and nor does Shmuel. They are completely unaware of their surroundings which prevents one thing from getting in their way: fear. Fear causes worry, distraction, emotional pain; things those innocent Jewish prisoners had to go through in the cruel concentration camps. Because there is confusion amongst the boys, it allows the author to explain his message in simple terms so that the readers can fully understand what he's trying to say.Boyne has a rather-- interesting style of writing. His writing is very simple and easy to understand, however, he includes secret messages and hints that are hidden behind his simplified terms in which makes it very unique. His tone is very subtle yet can be an emotional explosion and because he mastered the use of how he expresses himself, he uses this to his advantage which makes his writing very captivating.Other authors who write historical fiction books, for example Markus Zusak and The Book Thief are different from Boyne\u2019s style. Other\u2019s consist of different perspective on narration or a frequent use of explaining things in the context of the text in which Boyne clearly points out for the readers to identify.One thing that the audience should be aware of is how much he emphasises on discrimination. No one should be ashamed of being who they are because of things like the religion they believe in or what color their skin color is. Shmuel along with the rest of the Jews were thrown into concentration camps and shamed on for being Jewish which in no way is a reason to be discriminated for. Discrimination is still a big part of society to this day and sometimes, we might not even notice that it\u2019s happening.From reading this book, the message seems to be clear. Everyone should be treated the same, no matter how you look or what you believe in. We should be caring for each other and accepting the faiths and opinions that people follow and are a part of. It allows for more diversity amongst society and makes our everyday lives a little bit more interesting.Because Boyne is good at making things simple to understand, I think I would recommend this book to middle school kids. I feel as if at that point, they\u2019ve reached a point of maturity and that they should be aware of the history that happened before them and the things that are still happening in the world. Parents might want to say that it is \u201cinappropriate\u201d for kids at that age but I feel as if discrimination is a worldwide conflict and that informing kids at a young age will better prepare them for the future.Will humans completely comprehend the danger and effect discrimination has on people?Probably not, but by reading this book, it can give you a clear understanding on why it happens and the things it\u2019s capable of.",

                "reviewText": "A Haunting Tale of Innocence and Ignorance:A Review of \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\"John Boyne's \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a poignant and thought-provoking story set against the backdrop of the Holocaust. The novel's narrative revolves around two young boys, Bruno, the son of a Nazi commandant, and Shmuel, a Jewish boy imprisoned in the concentration camp adjacent to their home. Their unlikely friendship, born out of innocence and curiosity, serves as a powerful counterpoint to the horrors of the war that surrounds them.Bruno, a curious and imaginative boy of nine, is uprooted from his comfortable life in Berlin when his father is promoted to commandant of a concentration camp. Reluctantly moving to the desolate countryside, Bruno finds himself isolated and bored, yearning for companionship. One day, while exploring the perimeter of the camp, he stumbles upon a young boy clad in striped pajamas, Shmuel, a prisoner on the other side of the fence.Despite their vastly different worlds, Bruno and Shmuel develop an unlikely friendship. They meet regularly under the fence, sharing stories, food, and dreams. Their bond deepens as they navigate the complexities of their circumstances, their innocence shielding them from the full grasp of the atrocities unfolding around them.Boyne masterfully captures the innocence and vulnerability of childhood through Bruno's perspective. Bruno, oblivious to the true nature of his father's work, sees the camp as a strange and mysterious place, unaware of the suffering and persecution that lie within its walls. His naivety highlights the absurdity and cruelty of the Nazi regime, emphasizing the devastating impact of war on the minds of children.Shmuel, on the other hand, bears the weight of the world's horrors. His experiences in the camp have stripped him of his childhood, leaving him with a profound understanding of loss and suffering. Yet, amidst the despair, he finds solace in his friendship with Bruno, a reminder of the humanity that still exists amidst the darkness.As their friendship deepens, Bruno's innocence gradually crumbles. He witnesses the brutality of the camp guards and the despair of the prisoners, slowly piecing together the truth about his father's role in the atrocities. The realization shatters his world, forcing him to confront the harsh realities of the world he has been shielded from.The novel's climax is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking. Bruno's innocent act of kindness leads to a tragic end, highlighting the devastating consequences of prejudice and ignorance. The final scene leaves a lasting impact, a stark reminder of the human cost of war and the importance of empathy and understanding.\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a powerful and moving tale that resonates deeply with readers of all ages. Its exploration of innocence, friendship, and the horrors of war serves as a poignant reminder of the human capacity for both compassion and cruelty. The novel's enduring legacy lies in its ability to challenge our perspectives and inspire us to confront the darkness of the world with a glimmer of hope.",

                "reviewTitle": "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas book review",
                "reviewText": "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne is a well-written piece of literature, in which we follow Bruno, a nine-year-old boy, while he goes through circumstances that will transform his life. The book starts out in the city of Berlin, Germany, where Bruno is quite content with what his life consists of. He has a big house with five floors (if you count the basement and the little room at the top with the window), as well as three best friends for life. He comes home one day and discovers that the maid is packing all of his possessions into four large crates, then later finds out from his mother that they are moving. When he arrives at the new house he utterly loathes it. The new house only has three floors, is miles from any other dwellings, and there\u2019s a strange tall fence behind it. Bruno meets a boy on the other side of the barricade and befriends him, but a perfect friendship doesn\u2019t always promise a perfect ending. Written from a child\u2019s point of view, innocence is a major theme of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. Bruno doesn\u2019t know the difference between good and evil, and can\u2019t seem to figure out the difference between himself and the boy on the other side of the fence. Bruno\u2019s friendship with this boy demonstrates an extreme lack of knowledge. The people on the other side of the fence were Jews, and he was German. During that time there was extreme prejudice held against the Jews. They were considered less than human, and no German that wanted any respect would have anything to do with them. Innocence and prejudice go hand in hand, a lack of innocence can lead one to prejudice, but if one has innocence, there can be no prejudice. Innocence can keep you from harm, but in Bruno\u2019s case, it led him straight into it. John Boyne\u2019s writing captures the very essence of equality. None of the adults realize that Jews are no different than they are, and yet Bruno can see past the mask of prejudice and recognizes that he is indeed the same as the boy on the other side of the fence. Boyne writes the way a child would think, for example: \u201c[Bruno\u2019s] mouth made the shape of an O (pg 6).\u201d The average adult would not think this way. Boyne also supplants words like \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d with \u201cFury\u201d. Because Boyne is writing from a child\u2019s point of view, his writing corresponds with the mentality of a child. Boyne\u2019s sentences are exceedingly lengthy and sometimes slightly confusing, which can make reading aloud quite difficult, rereading certain passages may be necessary. Silent reading will essentially eliminate this problem, and will keep the message unhindered. Reading The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a great experience, and it will definitely be worth your while. John Boyne\u2019s book reveals the major injustices of the Holocaust, while creating a bond between us and the characters. Overall The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a fantastic novel that everyone should take the time to read.",
