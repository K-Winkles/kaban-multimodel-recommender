                "reviewText": "This is a heartwarming story about a woman who adopted a dog no one wanted and gave her a better life. As an animal rescue volunteer myself, I loved reading about Sadie's journey and how her story continues to inspire others.However, I couldn't give it five stars because there was one part that really took away from an otherwise sweet story. The author described getting Sadie registered as an emotional support animal just so she could fly. You should only be getting a dog registered as an ESA if you genuinely need the dog with you, not just because you want your dog to fly with you. It might not seem like a big deal to some people, but pretending to need an ESA is harmful for the people who actually need them. If that part hadn't been in the book, I would've enjoyed it so much more.",
