                "reviewText": "I've been very slowly making my way through a long list of books recommended by a librarian I follow on social media. Next up on the docket was this charming-looking book that began life as a webcomic, with the creator going on to have a successful comic and TV career. Being a webcomic creator myself, this info immediately caught my attention, and I was eager to see what all the hype was. And upon completion, I can understand how the author went on to have such success in the writing world.In a fantasy world where magic and science work side by side, Ballister Blackheart is a famed and feared supervillain who is constantly at odds with his arch nemesis---the handsome and heroic Ambrosius Goldenloin, along with the Institution who serve as the world's peace keepers. But Blackheart's luck changes when, one random day, a mysterious girl named Nimona arrives at his doorstep. Not only is the young woman eager to become his sidekick, but she has the power to shapeshift into anything and anyone she wants. Together, the unlikely pair go on a crime spree---winning one victory after another, and taking revenge on those who wronged them. But not everything is as it appears, and the more Blackheart begins digging into Nimona's past, the more he begins to realize his henchwoman has her own motives for joining him....and that she's far more powerful than anyone could've imagined. And soon, the acts of this one lady will turn the entire kingdom and its perceptions of heroes and villains upside down. And in the end, one question will remain; is Nimona a girl who can turn into a monster? Or is she a monster disguised as a girl?Beginning with the presentation, the setting is very unique, as this is clearly a mostly medieval world with knights, dragons, swords, and sorcery...but wrist communicators, television, and video games also exist, making the time period ambiguous. I wouldn't totally call it \"steampunk\", but it's the only word that comes closest to describing this alternate reality where old world values, magic, and scientific technology live side by side. The art style comes off as relatively simple---evoking the vibe of a teenager doodling in their notebook, and I mean that in the best way possible. It perfectly serves a story that's mostly comedic. But as time goes on, and the story takes a turn for the dark and serious, the art, in turn, gains more dramatic lighting and camera angles. (Makes sense, considering this is coming from the person who was the showrunner for the Netflix \"She-Ra\" series.)More importantly, no one in this book is as they appear. The Institution that serves as the protection force might actually be the true source of the kingdom's problems. Goldenloin comes off as your stereotypical stalwart hero, only for it to be shown that he used underhanded methods to gain his status. Blackheart seems to be your classic, moustache-twirling villain, but it's clear from the start that he has a moral code, and only seeks revenge on the people who turned him into what he is. (It's also hinted these two used to be an item, which makes their dynamic all the more interesting. Anyone who enjoys the rivalry between MCU Thor and Loki will probably like Goldenloin and Blackheart. They even look similar to said superheroes, just with the color palettes swapped.) As for the titular Nimona? Well, to say any more about her would be major spoilers. Let's just say that behind her carefree attitude lies a very clever mind who has her own machinations beyond just being Blackheart's henchwoman.This is a really fun (and often funny) adventure that takes the typical hero and villain tropes and turns them on their head, with a deeper message about questioning authority, and not taking anything or anyone at face value. Anyone who enjoys shows like \"Adventure Time\" will want to give this a look.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked the characters and the fact that their (in truth tragic) backstories weren\u2019t made soppy or given as an excuse for everything they do. The art was super dynamic, which gave a real shine to all the fight sequences. The story is somewhat open-ended, but otherwise has a satisfying conclusion, although I would have been over the moon if there was at least one more sequel. It\u2019s one of those stories that you like so much you actually dread finishing it - you get so attached that it leaves a hole inside of you, a vague longing upon reaching the end.As a side note, I am not usually the romance fan, but I kinda wish there was at least one kiss. Come on, all the build up for some chaste hugging?? It\u2019s not actually an issue - the main story is quite solid and as a result captivating - just a little something I felt the characters in question (and the readers) deserved.",

BUT this is an incredible story in its own right! Very interesting, touches on a different set of issues. There are also some familiar story beats!To avoid spoilers, I enjoyed the plot a lot. The ending kind of saddened me, but I could see why it was probably for the best. Everyone needs therapy.I enjoy the art style, and the jokes are my favorite! A fun read. I got through all of it in one evening, which I haven\u2019t done in years!Overall, 10/10, good book; the only problem is that there isn\u2019t more!",

                "reviewText": "It took me far too long to get round to reading Nimona, having bought it so long ago. It's good to be in the right mood to read a book, and sometimes that takes a while.It's a tale about not judging a book by its cover, or jumping to conclusions about societal \"norms\". The story introduces us to Blackheart as the dastardly one-armed villain, Nimona his childishly cruel weird sidekick, and Goldenloin as the dashingly perfect hero. Standard roles in fantasy. Stevenson breathes subtlety and complexity into these characters, transforming them in the process.The art is lovely throughout. Expressive characters are expressive and repressed charxcters are not. It's well paced and always clear what's going on. It's a pleasure to look at as well as read.If I had one criticism it's that to begin with the characters all speak with pretty much the same voice. But the dialogue improves as the story builds. The characters become themselves. So if you read a sample here and come to that conclusion, please don't be put off.This is a very strong piece of work. I enjoyed it more and more the more I read. It doesn't beat you over the head with messages of diversity and inclusion, they are skillfully woven into the fabric of both the characters and the story. Nimona is a powerful reminder to always be curious.",
