        "description": "The shocking true crime story of one of the most bizarre mass murders ever recorded\u2014and the girl who escaped with her life.In the fall of 2010, in the all-American town of Apple Valley, Ohio, four people disappeared without a trace: Stephanie Sprang; her friend, Tina Maynard; and Tina\u2019s two children, thirteen-year-old Sarah and eleven-year-old Kody. Investigators began scouring the area, yet despite an extensive search, no signs of the missing people were discovered. On the fourth day of the search, evidence trickled in about neighborhood \u201cweirdo\u201d Matthew Hoffman. A police SWAT team raided his home and found an extremely disturbing sight: every square inch of the place was filled with leaves and a terrified Sarah Maynard was bound up in the middle of it like some sort of perverted autumn tableau. But there was no trace of the others. Then came Hoffman\u2019s confession to an unspeakable crime that went beyond murder and defied all reason. His tale of evil would make Sarah\u2019s survival and rescue all the more astonishing\u2014a compelling tribute to a young girl\u2019s resilience and courage and to her fierce determination to reclaim her life in the wake of unimaginable trauma.",

Bad sentence structure, talking about characters in past tense as if they had died too. I'm kind of a grammar snob, and I found myself too often thinking of a better way he could have written the previous sentence. But that's just me. I live in northeast Ohio and had never heard about this horrific case. What made me extremely sad is that I looked up this family on Google and found that some time in 2013 Larry and his wife were in court for abusing Sarah. I'm glad I had already finished the book because I think that might have ruined the story for me. Hadn't this poor girl been through enough, without her biological father and his wife abusing her? Especially after all his pontificating in the book about how incredibly brave, special, and resilient she is? Outrageous. I am almost moved to write him a letter.",

                "reviewText": "I grew up in Knox county but moved away about 15 years ago. When this crime occurred I was constantly checking the news for updates, and took a personal interest because several events unfolded within close proximity to my parent's home.I'm not a reader of true-crime books so I have nothing else to compare to, but I think I understand where some of the criticisms come in on this review board. I will say this book gives a good summarization of events, timelines, and quotes as they pertained to each. For me it was much more helpful than trying to piece together news articles and interviews. However, if you're looking for a thrilling story and deep-digging investigative writing, this probably won't appeal to you. It's written in a very chronological sense and doesn't build drama the way a captive narrative should. Again, I'm not faulting it for that, I'm just saying it's a completely different type of book than I think some readers are looking for.That said, I do take issue with several \"facts\" in the book, simply because I am very familiar with the roads, people's names, and other miscellaneous information from the area. Whether they were typos or deliberately changed or just shoddy research, there are several inaccuracies within this book. For example, the author references intersections that don't actually exist, sites someone's name as \"Jan\" when it should be \"Jay\", and mislabels simple landmarks. With such small and maybe insignificant details being messed up throughout the book, it casts some doubt in my mind about the author's effort and attention to details during the actual significant parts of the story.As this appears to be the only book written about these horrific events, I'll have to make do with this author's account and rate it as OK simply because I was compelled to read it in pretty much one sitting. However, if other books are conceived from this crime, I have a feeling the ratings of this book, by comparison, will certainly go down.",

                "reviewText": "This is an unusual true crime book. For the reader, the suspense is generated by whether an intended victim will be able to escape, not learning the killer\u2019s identity. The author gives away who the bad guy is on the first page. I was compelled to keep reading to discover a girl\u2019s fate rather than whether the police would catch the killer.Neighbors knew there was something wrong with Matt Hoffman\u2019s behavior. Matt lived with his girlfriend and her young son. He seemed nice at first, but then he changed. Matt\u2019s dogs disappeared. He and his girlfriend had a violent argument, and she moved out. The neighbors didn\u2019t know half of what Matt could do.Miles away, Tina Hermann was busy being the single mom of two kids, Sarah, 13, and Kody, 11. One day as the kids came home from school, they were surprised that their mother didn\u2019t greet them at the door. Then they saw the blood. As they moved further inside, they were rushed by a man. Sarah got away and ran to her bedroom. The man grabbed Kody. Before Sarah could escape, the man was in her room and subdued her with ripped-out electrical cords. Sarah was gagged and bound. She didn't know what had happened to her mother and brother.Tina didn\u2019t show up to work, and her boss notified the police to make a wellness check. When the police entered the empty house, the tell-tale signs of blood everywhere alerted the officers to a terrible scene. They didn\u2019t know that Tina\u2019s best friend, Stephanie Sprang, was also missing. She had stopped by Tina\u2019s house. When her boyfriend reported her as missing also, officers learned that now they had two women and two children who had disappeared.Meanwhile, Sarah had been taken to a house, left bound, and gagged in a dank, lightless basement. When the man came to visit her, she realized that everywhere she looked were leaves, bags, and bags of them. She was lying on a bed of leaves. To her horror, her situation was only going to get much worse.The book documents a gripping, suspenseful case where a young girl\u2019s life was in the balance, and the opportunities for her escape were few. It\u2019s an easy book to read, but the subject is the stuff of nightmares. True crime fans should find the book riveting.",
