How people will deceive you and trade with you all to save their own life. Shows how relationships built will only help you when the time comes. Breathe taking depiction and great read. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING GRUESOME THIS IS NOT IT. WATCH VIDEO.Complaints?Hate to say it but I was looking for more tragic stories. What he went through was tragic but I feel this depiction is rated E for everyone. I wanted to read about aushwitz and how people survived but it's mentioned in the book. Not guesomely mentioned. Great book and shows life of people on the run. WATCH VIDEO.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Oddly Effective and Emotional Presentation \u2026",
                "reviewText": "I made the \u201cmistake\u201d of purchasing Maus II over 20 years ago (simply because the bookstore didn\u2019t have the first volume). Regardless, I found the comic book presentation of the Holocaust surprisingly effective in generating such an emotional read. It took a while, but seeing Maus II sitting on a book shelf without it preceding volume finally bothered me enough to get MAUS \u2013 MY FATHER BLEEDS HISTORY. While the second volume (MAUS II) stands fine on its own, MAUS certainly serves as the glue that holds the entire story together.For the most part, I\u2019m am not a fan of comic books, but Art Spiegelman\u2019s art captivated me at an early age. Spiegelman is one of the original artists that contributed to my first childhood passion: Wacky Packages (trading cards/stickers that satirized common household products). While I didn\u2019t initially connect the dots between the 70s fad and Holocaust-themed comic book, I now see the way Spiegelman attracts me to his work. There is a subtle complexity to his rather simple drawings that made reading MAUS both thought-provoking and memorable.I found MAUS to be two stories presented as one. The main storyline is the story of his father Vladeck\u2019s plight as a Jew living in Poland before and during World War II (just before he and his wife Anja are sent to Auschwitz). The second storyline is about the author\u2019s relationship with his father, which is revealed as the son presses his father to talk about surviving the Holocaust. While the story of Spiegelman\u2019s parents is certainly compelling, the metaphorical manner in which it is illustrated is what sticks. Spiegelman uses animals to represent groups/races of people in a way that reminds me of Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d. Jews are presented as mice \u2026 meek pests/vermin that are easy to kill. Nazis/Germans are depicted as rather vicious cats (that kill the vermin) and Poles are shown as pigs (perhaps a reference to the fact that many Poles betrayed Jews in their country to the Nazis \u2026 in other words, swine). I found graphic metaphors ingenious as they add a significant emotional tone to the story being told. The Holocaust storyline comprises the bulk of the book\u2019s illustrations with the father/son moments serving as bridges in between events. As we come to understand the suffering of Spiegelman\u2019s parents, we learn that his mother (Anja) killed herself in 1968, leaving a large void in his life. There is an obvious yearning for Spiegelman to learn more about his mother through his father, yet the task proves to be challenging.On the surface, the concept of a Holocaust-related \u201ccomic book\u201d seems awkward, but I found MAUS to be a magnificent and poignant read. It is also hard to put down \u2026 I read the entire book without stopping in short order. I would highly recommend MAUS (and MAUS II, for that matter) for providing a provocatively unique perspective of the Holocaust. This series intrigued me enough to pick up a copy of \u201cMetaMaus\u201d, which meticulously (and exhaustively) explores the author\u2019s motive for MAUS/MAUS II, as well as detailing more of his parents\u2019 lives.",

                "reviewText": "This book should never be banned. Now, I want to read why it was banned! I have read many books about the Holocaust but I am extremely impressed by this one. Not only did you have to worry about be caught and killed by the Nazis, but you had to be very careful about who you trusted. It was so easy to be betrayed by your friends and relatives. Trust was extremely precious and risky. This situation is evident in this graphic novel, much more than in many accounts of Holocaust survivors. The language in this book makes the experience of reading it more real. I want to read Maus, Part II and when I read accounts by survivors, I will be lookung for guilt, betrayal and secrets. The last two panes of this graphic novel speak of what has often remained secret and unforgiveable.One school board member when objecting to this book, said \"Why can't they teach a nicer Holocaust\"! Is it really better to coverup what you don't like in history and teach a \"nicer version\"? To do that means teaching a lie, that the Holocaust was not that bad. How ridiculous!",

                "reviewText": "habia leido muchos comentarios acerca de esta obra y si bien era exceptico, cuando la tuve en mis manos me atrap\u00f3 desde las primeras p\u00e1ginas si bien pensaba que la historia comenzaba en los campos de concentracion me parecio genial que se describan los antecedentesinmediatos del holocausto, el proceso de creacion de la obra misma, su desarrollo si bien no es del todo original el conjunto si lo es y no solo eso cumple con el objetivo de todo buena obra de arte: involucrar al lector/espectador.El trazo del dibujo me parecio en un principio rudo y agreste pero en la medida que uno va leyendo este aspecto cobra sentido completamente y le da mucha fuerza y atmosfera a la historia.Algo que me parecio muy interesante es el trabajo de Spiegelman como una especie de confesion autobiografica acerca de su relacion con su padre, su trabajo como artista y su posicion con respecto a la Historia.",
