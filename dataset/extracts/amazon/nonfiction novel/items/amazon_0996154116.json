Sixteen-year-old Nannie Colquitt Hill makes her debut in the antebellum society of the Chattahoochee River plantations. A thousand miles to the north, a Wisconsin farm boy, Hugh LaGrange, joins an Abolitionist crusade to ban slavery in Bleeding Kansas.Five years later, secession and total war against the homefronts of Dixie hurl them toward a confrontation unrivaled in American history.Nannie defies the traditions of Southern gentility by forming a women\u2019s militia and drilling it to prepare for Northern invaders. With their men dead, wounded, or retreating with the Confederate armies, only Captain Nannie and her Fighting Nancies stand between their beloved homes and the Yankee torches.Hardened into a slashing Union cavalry colonel, Hugh duels Rebel generals Joseph Wheeler and Nathan Bedford Forrest across Tennessee and Alabama. As the war churns to a bloody climax, he is ordered to drive a burning stake deep into the heart of the Confederacy.Yet one Georgia town\u2014which by mocking coincidence bears Hugh\u2019s last name\u2014stands defiant in his path.Read the remarkable story of the Southern women who formed America\u2019s most famous female militia and the Union officer whose life they changed forever.",

Craney takes the time to not only set the ideology of both sides of the Mason-Dixon line, he gets into the protagonists so deeply you feel and think as they do. He then crosses the chasm of disagreement and hatred to remind us all that we are all Americans and what that really means, especially in these adversarial times. His portrayal of the women of the times is stellar and what's long been missing from the journals of the Civil War. A must read in the style and genre of the Shaara's.",

For me, it was literary bubble gum and cotton candy, delicious, but basically empty calories. Other reviewers have lauded the author's appropriate historical dialog and details. I was jarred by several anachronisms. Blue Mascara would not have been on anyone eye lashes in Georgia during the civil war, as mascara was only invented in Paris in 1872. And I am pretty sure blue mascara did not exist until the early 1960's; I remember the thrill of discovering it. Reference to someone tearing a page out of a physician's \"prescription pad\" in the 1860s also jolted me.The dialog of the northern recruits was OK, but I wonder if the author ever heard a Black person from the \"South\" speak. The speech of the \"Southern Belles\" is stilted and inane. I learned from this book that the Nancy Hart militias existed. But nothing new about the Civil war besides that. I learned more in an afternoon at Gettysburg walking around and reading the information on the monuments and the Park Service information plaques posted throughout the battlefield. I would recommend this book as \"Civil War Light\" for a middle school/ junior high reader.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a fan of Craney's historical fiction, since reading his 2015 Fire and the Light. His research is always impeccably accurate, and my historical knowledge has been deepened about the particular period covered in each of his books. For me, the most enjoyable way to learn interesting and quirky historical facts, as well as getting reacquainted with major events and characters, is to read well-written historical fiction. The Cotillion Brigade does not disappoint.The opening dialogue of the Confederate women is so chatty, feminine, and cattily gentile, had I not known otherwise, I would have assumed the author was a woman. Gone With The Wind is a fair comparison for the authenticity of the Southern Belles' conversations. But when the story shifts to Wisconsin, and the second protagonist is a farm boy, his roughness feels just as real.The book's conceit of two heroes, Nancy, a loyal Confederate woman, who organizes the first all-female brigade for the Confederacy, and Hugh, farm-boy turned abolitionist turned aggressive Union officer, is a clever device to humanize both sides in the Civil War. It works well to keep the reader interested in both stories as the narrator shifts from one to the other, chapter by chapter, as the war approaches and then progresses on its bloody way.Some \"progressives\" might question the propriety of featuring a Confederate woman in a book published in 2021. I did. But no matter one's personal politics, we should not forget that actual human beings, who were interesting and decent in other ways, were slaveholders. That sin does not bar revealing their humanity, as long as we don't shirk from also portraying the ugly reality of slavery. Craney does not shirk. And, spoiler alert, the Union wins the war.",
