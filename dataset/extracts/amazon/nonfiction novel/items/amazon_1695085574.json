However, little things, as a Sacramentan, annoyed me, like getting street names wrong or saying someone's children didn't live in Sacramento and then say that her son traveled all the way from South Land Park to Sacramento to visit his mom. Um...anyone from Sacramento knows that South Land Park is a neighborhood IN Sacramento. Those kind of things irked me. Made me rethink some of the information in the book was pure fabrication. It was obvious that the author didn't know Sacramento, and makes me wonder if he even visited the place where it all happened.",

First, I do want to say it was interesting enough to keep my attention, but the large text the book comes printed in was distracting to me. It almost seems made for those with vision issues. Secondly, there are some grammatical issues/typos. Not a ton, but they\u2019re there. Plot-wise, are multiple instances in which the author leaves you hanging, not connecting you to how a scenario got from Point A to Point B. Finally, it didn\u2019t seem like there was a good ending. It just kind of... ends. The trial was barely covered. I had to Google to answer some of my remaining questions. Overall, it\u2019s average.",

                "reviewText": "I like all of the books that Ryan Green has written but this one stands out. The one trait I admire about Mr. green as an author is that he does extensive research on the subjects in which he is writing about.I have heard of Dorothea previously but into this depth , I knew she was a serial killer but what I didn't know was about her history....,including marriages , adoptions ,etc.She looks like a sweet grandma and most neighbors and townsfolk thought of her that way. She was able to manipulate social services into believing that she was the best option for the disabled and or elderly that otherwise wouldn't have had a place to call home. The fact that she went undiscovered for years shows how effective her manipulation was.Here was the sweet grandma type lady that one would think was opening her heart and home to the less fortunate but in truth was a monster. The way she carried her crimes out and was successful in burying bodies in her garden astonishes me. She is this monster that was able to kill at night and put on a sweet face in the morning and accept new residents without question, continuing her horrors. And to top it all off, she actually walked away nonchalantly on one of the days they were starting to dig her yard when finally tipped about what was really going on. She fled at that time and was eventually caught when noticed by an elderly friend .This book is worth the read and is one that you can't put down until it is finished .",

                "reviewText": "Once again Mr. Green does not disappoint! Although it is not stated in his book, it is my opinion that Mr. Greene's subject, Dorethea, was a narcissist among other things such as a sociopath. All narcissists have an insatiable need for their own personal and individual \"narcissist supply\". Dorethea's was for admiration and attention and she would go to any length to hide her sinister side, even to herself. This author did an excellent job in illuminating this woman's psychopathy. A sad story indeed for all of her victims and their families. But an excellent eye-opener to the depths of evil, deception, greed, and incredible denial that lurks in the minds of some of the most-unlikely suspects.Editing was top-notch; no sloppy grammatical errors or mid-spells like so many kindle books I have read in the past. Mr. Green writes in such a way that unfolds all of the details and has researched his subjects well. There are no unanswered questions at the end for the reader which I appreciate. And he keeps the reader intensely interested. I could not put this book down till I finished it!",

                "reviewText": "This is an unbelievable story of a serial killer unlike those houses in films or read about in fiction. This is a real story of a very dangerous woman. This book traces her origins and tells of her many victims. It is written very factually and there is no over dramatisation, the author widely realising that the story does not need to be dramatised, the truth itself is shocking enough.Very well written book total recommend to any one who likes a well told story.I was drawn into this story and quite shocked at the extent of this woman's evil.",

                "reviewText": "Dorothea Puente was a charming, kindly old lady who fed the local homeless including the cats and no one would have believed she was capable of such utter cruelty had they not seen (and smelt) the evidence for themselves. Once again Ryan Green has produced a well-written book documenting the criminal activity of this woman. It is highly likely that her mother's continued excessive use of alcohol before and after Dorothea's birth, including her total neglect once she was weaned contributed in no small part to Dorothea's total lack of compassion or empathy for any other human being. It is, however, difficult to understand how she managed to fly under the radar for so very long to not only violate her parole conditions but to hoodwink the social workers who called on her all the time checking up on those at risk people assigned to their care. After all, it wasn't as if Dorothea didn't have a criminal record, she had quite a lengthy one involving fraud and theft. For me, the most chilling aspect of this story is Dorothea's inability to understand that what she had done was wrong. As a member of this Author's ARC group, I received an advance copy of this book and having read the book this is my honest review.",
