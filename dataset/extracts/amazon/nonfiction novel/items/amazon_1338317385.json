                "reviewText": "I have not read this book, but I\u2019ve read a few others in this series with my granddaughter. She came to visit me at almost age eleven, struggling with reading and undiagnosed learning difficulties. She was embarrassed and frustrated and ready to give up. She was definitely not reading for any pleasure! She had tried reading children\u2019s fiction with some help, but the stories didn\u2019t hold her interest\u2014even when I read them to her. I worked with her every day for three months using a 3rd grade curriculum, doing lessons aloud, practicing spelling, vocabulary, reading (and arithmetic!) in colorful and well-organized workbooks. It became obvious that she preferred non-fiction or stories of survival and adventure. Our first trip to the library nearly made me cry. She simply wouldn\u2019t look at books. They were too intimidating. We went to the bookstore, where she found these books in the edge of the children\u2019s section. We read the first two aloud\u2014taking turns reading. By the third, she was doing all the reading herself. I\u2019ve sent her many of these books since then. She loves them and now enjoys reading for pleasure. As well, she has become quite a scholar. I recommend these books for young readers like my granddaughter, who prefer serious reading, but need to combine building reading skills with learning about historical events, people, and general knowledge, as well as enjoying good stories that flex their imaginations and empathy.",

                "reviewText": "My 9 yo daughter has loved the I Survived series for a few years now. Truth be told, I do too.The stories are always about a kid (usually 11yo) who lives through historical disasters, and we learn about those disasters through his/her eyes.The tales are well-written and include facts- as well as historical fiction to hold the audience\u2019s attention.They are exciting and sad; gripping and profound; tragic and heartwarming. You can always count on the main kid-character surviving...but not always the other people in the story.Your child and you will certainly come away with the intended morals:*War is Hell. (D day, Pearl Harbor, Gettysburg, American Revolution, Civil War etc)*People can be evil: (Hitler, 9/11, maybe in a few years, Trump will be a subject of one of her books)*The newest inventions aren\u2019t always the best: (Titanic, Hindenburg)Don\u2019t turn your back on nature: (Tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, fires, floods)Animals are wild; don\u2019t turn your back on them either:: (sharks, grizzlies)And molasses is...well. We are reading that one next.Really can not recommend enough.",
