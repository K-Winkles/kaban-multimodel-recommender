                "reviewText": "FYI we got this book for my 10 year old daughter's history project on Amelia Earheart. We have loved all the Who Was (or Who HQ) books we have purchased until now, but this one is in a comic book format. I realize now I should have noticed that it said graphic novel, but was just used to what we had encountered before. Also, the authors are very focused on their sexual orientation and pronouns, which I (call me outdated if you will...) do not feel is appropriate to include in the back of a children's book. Sexuality is the last thing my 10 year old cares about. She still thinks boys have cooties and says she never wants to get married. But is also in the least interested in girls in that way. LoL \ud83d\ude02 I just find this completely unnecessary. IMHO, tell the kids about your hobbies, your pets, your family but please leave sexuality out of it. Hope this will help any parents searching for books like this.",
