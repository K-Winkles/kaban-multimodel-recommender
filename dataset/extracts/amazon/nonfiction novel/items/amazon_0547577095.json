        "description": "The unforgettable Newbery Medal\u2013winning novel from Lois Lowry. As the German troops begin their campaign to \"relocate\" all the Jews of Denmark, Annemarie Johansen\u2019s family takes in Annemarie\u2019s best friend, Ellen Rosen, and conceals her as part of the family.Through the eyes of ten-year-old Annemarie, we watch as the Danish Resistance smuggles almost the entire Jewish population of Denmark, nearly seven thousand people, across the sea to Sweden. The heroism of an entire nation reminds us that there was pride and human decency in the world even during a time of terror and war.A modern classic of historical fiction, Number the Stars has won generations of fans and continues to speak to today's readers. Jessica Grose wrote in a November 2022 New York Times essay entitled \"This Perfect Mother-Daughter Read Holds a Powerful Lesson for Fighting Antisemitism\": \u201cNumber the Stars is particularly relevant to our family, and to this moment.\"As School Library Journal put it: \"Readers are taken to the very heart of Annemarie's experience, and, through her eyes, come to understand the true meaning of bravery.\"",
