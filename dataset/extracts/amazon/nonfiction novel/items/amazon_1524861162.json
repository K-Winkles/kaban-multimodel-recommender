        "description": "A humorous graphic investigation of the author's obsession with true crime, the murders that have most captivated her throughout her life, and a love letter to her fellow true-crime fanatics.Why is it so much fun to read about death and dismemberment? In Murder Book, lifelong true-crime obsessive and New Yorker cartoonist Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell tries to puzzle out the answer. An unconventional graphic exploration of a lifetime of Ann Rule super-fandom, amateur armchair sleuthing, and a deep dive into the high-profile murders that have fascinated the author for decades, this is a funny, thoughtful, and highly personal blend of memoir, cultural criticism, and true crime with a focus on the often-overlooked victims of notorious killers.",

                "reviewText": "I got this book because it was on sale for only 1$ and because Im interested in graphic memoirs. That turns out to be a great bargain. The author explores possible reasons for her passion for true crime and in so doing explores human psychology and changes in society. Embedded in her story are the stories of several murders with respectful attention to the victims. This isnt about \"the gore\" nor an exploration of motivations for murder but detailing events in each case and how the murderer was caught. In doing so she shares her opinions and conversatuons with families and friends who share the interest. She summarizes the rise of interest in true crime, mentioning examples for each form of media. At the end she explores some sociological questions that society is addressing. This is a very thoughtful book but not preachy.I found that once I started it I couldnt stop reading. I missed supper and it is her fault for engaging me in a topic I thought I was only mildly interested in and also a bit afraid of (Im nightmare-prone). She ends on a positive note, given the subject matter, and I think satisfactorily explains the fascination.I read the Kindle version using my Android phone app. I alternated between the Kindle navigation for graphic stories and just enlarging pages with my fingers to read each panel at a time. I used both for different sorts of layouts-sometimes the page was very sequential, sometimes I wanted to be reminded of her overall page design.I dont feel qualified to comment on art. I found it satisfactory for telling the story although she included some panels of her on the toilet while she was narrating something. I guess toilet humor is universal? Also a few pages' content were a bit scattered, but that may have been meant to convey her style of talking to family. It only happened about 2 or 3x out of about 300 pages and then she caught the thread and moved forward. It was not a big hurdle or I wouldve gotten my supper! Highly recommend for autobiography lovers, true crime fans or not and persons interested in niche history or history made personal.",

                "reviewText": "I could understand the author's interest in \"true crime,\" since I share it myself. She does know her stuff about the murders she discusses. That said, I didn't care for the art (No offense to anyone, but it just didn't \"do it\" for me) and I found her editorial digressions a bit annoying. It can be hard to know why some murders and some serial killers grab everybody's attention, while others are, at most, a few days' wonder and then forgotten. Yes, it took a while for the cops to catch up to the Atlanta child killer, but that probably had little-or-nothing to do with race. John Wayne Gacy's victims were 100% white, and he racked up more kills, even though there were clues pointing to him all over the place. The cops aren't infallible, nor are they all-knowing. And media attention is a fickle thing at best.",

                "reviewText": "\u2018Murder Book: A Graphic Memoir of a True Crime Obsession\u2019 is a quirky memoir by Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, a cartoonist for the New Yorker.In it she celebrates her life-long love of true crime (and some crime fiction) and credits her mother for this obsession. Indeed, it appears to run in her family back to her great-grandmother, Annabel Fitzgerald, sister of F. Scott.While I am more drawn to crime fiction, I too have been bitten by the true crime bug so could relate. Fitzgerald Campbell has a playful, tongue-in-cheek style and her humour is very dark.While I was aware that women are avid readers of mysteries and crime fiction, I wasn\u2019t aware that the same was true of true crime. She offers some possible reasons for this trend.She analyses some famous cases including The Zodiac andTed Bundy and celebrates Ann Rule\u2019s prolific career as a writer of true crime. She then moves on to true crime documentaries and the rise of true crime podcasts, something that I expect is more of an American phenomenon as none mentioned were familiar to me.Woven throughout are witty personal anecdotes. Aside from her work as a cartoonist, she is also a standup comedian, so some of these were a bit edgy. I definitely could relate to her love of Law & Order and its \u2018ripped from the headlines\u2019 storylines.Overall, I enjoyed this memoir and Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell\u2019s playful cartoon style of art.",
