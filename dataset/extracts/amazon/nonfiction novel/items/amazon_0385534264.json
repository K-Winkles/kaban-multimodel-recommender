            "Editorial Reviews Amazon.com Review An Amazon Best Book of April 2023: David Grann, author of the best seller\u2014and Amazon Best Book of the Year\u2014Killers of the Flower Moon, unfurls a story of mayhem and murder, adventure, and reckless ambition on the high seas. Drawing on \u201carchival debris: the washed-out logbooks, the moldering correspondence, the half-truthful journals, the surviving records from the troubling court-martial,\u201d Grann brilliantly retells the story of the Wager\u2014a British boat bound for South America on a secret mission during the Imperial War with Spain. The fate of the captain and crew was not to be one of conquest or fortune, but frightening storms, shipwreck, savagery, and betrayal. While you can almost feel the salt spray on your skin and the creak and crashing of wood against rock, Grann also captures the pomp and circumstance of imperialism, the brazen bravado of power-hungry men, and the inhuman brutality that fear conjures. The personalities aboard this 18th century ship are made for the history books, as the saying goes, and Grann, once again, has written an epic narrative that is both shocking and utterly absorbing. \u2014Al Woodworth, Amazon Editor Review #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA Best Book of the Year: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, TIME, NPR, Esquire, BookPage\u201cThe most gripping sea-yarn I\u2019ve read in years\u2026.A tour de force of narrative nonfiction.

All rights reserved. Chapter 1The First LieutenantEach man in the squadron carried, along with a sea chest, his own burdensome story. Perhaps it was of a scorned love, or a secret prison conviction, or a pregnant wife left on shore weeping. Perhaps it was a hunger for fame and fortune, or a dread of death. David Cheap, the first lieutenant of the Centurion, the squadron\u2019s flagship, was no different. A burly Scotsman in his early forties with a protracted nose and intense eyes, he was in flight\u2014from squabbles with his brother over their inheritance, from creditors chasing him, from debts that made it impossible for him to find a suitable bride. Onshore, Cheap seemed doomed, unable to navigate past life\u2019s unexpected shoals. Yet as he perched on the quarterdeck of a British man-of-war, cruising the vast oceans with a cocked hat and spyglass, he brimmed with confidence\u2014even, some would say, a touch of haughtiness. The wooden world of a ship\u2014a world bound by the Navy\u2019s rigid regulations and the laws of the sea and, most of all, by the hardened fellowship of men\u2014had provided him a refuge. Suddenly he felt a crystalline order, a clarity of purpose. And Cheap\u2019s newest posting, despite the innumerable risks that it carried, from plagues and drowning to enemy cannon fire, offered what he longed for: a chance to finally claim a wealthy prize and rise to captain his own ship, becoming a lord of the sea.The problem was that he could not get away from the damned land. He was trapped\u2014cursed, really\u2014at the dockyard in Portsmouth, along the English Channel, struggling with feverish futility to get the Centurion fitted out and ready to sail. Its massive wooden hull, 144 feet long and 40 feet wide, was moored at a slip. Carpenters, caulkers, riggers, and joiners combed over its decks like rats (which were also plentiful). A cacophony of hammers and saws. The cobblestone streets past the shipyard were congested with rattling wheelbarrows and horse-drawn wagons, with porters, peddlers, pickpockets, sailors, and prostitutes. Periodically, a boatswain blew a chilling whistle, and crewmen stumbled from ale shops, parting from old or new sweethearts, hurrying to their departing ships in order to avoid their officers\u2019 lashes.It was January 1740, and the British Empire was racing to mobilize for war against its imperial rival Spain. And in a move that had suddenly raised Cheap\u2019s prospects, the captain under whom he served on the Centurion, George Anson, had been plucked by the Admiralty to be a commodore and lead the squadron of five warships against the Spanish. The promotion was unexpected. As the son of an obscure country squire, Anson did not wield the level of patronage, the grease\u2014or \u201cinterest,\u201d as it was more politely called\u2014that propelled many officers up the pole, along with their men. Anson, then forty-two, had joined the Navy at the age of fourteen, and served for nearly three decades without leading a major military campaign or snaring a lucrative prize.Tall, with a long face and a high forehead, he had a remoteness about him. His blue eyes were inscrutable, and outside the company of a few trusted friends he rarely opened his mouth. One statesman, after meeting with him, noted, \u201cAnson, as usual, said little.\u201d Anson corresponded even more sparingly, as if he doubted the ability of words to convey what he saw or felt. \u201cHe loved reading little, and writing, or dictating his own letters less, and that seeming negligence . . . \u200bdrew upon him the ill will of many,\u201d a relative wrote. A diplomat later quipped that Anson was so unknowing about the world that he\u2019d been \u201cround it, but never in it.\u201dNevertheless, the Admiralty had recognized in Anson what Cheap had also seen in him in the two years since he\u2019d joined the Centurion\u2019s crew: a formidable seaman. Anson had a mastery of the wooden world and, equally important, a mastery of himself\u2014he remained cool and steady under duress. His relative noted, \u201cHe had high notions of sincerity and honor and practiced them without deviation.\u201d In addition to Cheap, he had attracted a coterie of talented junior officers and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, all vying for his favor. One later informed Anson that he was more obliged to him than to his own father and would do anything to \u201cact up to the good opinion you are pleased to have of me.\u201d If Anson succeeded in his new role as commodore of the squadron, he would be in a position to anoint any captain he wanted. And Cheap, who\u2019d initially served as Anson\u2019s second lieutenant, was now his right-hand man.Like Anson, Cheap had spent much of his life at sea, a bruising existence he\u2019d at first hoped to escape. As Samuel Johnson once observed, \u201cNo man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.\u201d Cheap\u2019s father had possessed a large estate in Fife, Scotland, and one of those titles\u2014the second Laird of Rossie\u2014that evoked nobility even if it did not quite confer it. His motto, emblazoned on the family\u2019s crest, was Ditat virtus: \u201cVirtue enriches.\u201d He had seven children with his first wife, and, after she died, he had six more with his second, among them David.In 1705, the year that David celebrated his eighth birthday, his father stepped out to fetch some goat\u2019s milk and dropped dead. As was custom, it was the oldest male heir\u2014David\u2019s half brother James\u2014who inherited the bulk of the estate. And so David was buffeted by forces beyond his control, in a world divided between first sons and younger sons, between haves and have-nots. Compounding his upheaval, James, now ensconced as the third Laird of Rossie, frequently neglected to pay the allowance that had been bequeathed to his half brothers and half sister: some blood was apparently thicker than others\u2019. Driven to find work, David apprenticed to a merchant, but his debts mounted. So in 1714, the year he turned seventeen, he ran off to sea, a decision that was evidently welcomed by his family\u2014as his guardian wrote to his older brother, \u201cThe sooner he goes off it will be better for you and me.\u201dAfter these setbacks, Cheap seemed only more consumed by his festering dreams, more determined to bend what he called an \u201cunhappy fate.\u201d On his own, on an ocean distant from the world he knew, he might prove himself in elemental struggles\u2014braving typhoons, outdueling enemy ships, rescuing his companions from calamities.But though Cheap had chased a few pirates\u2014including the one-handed Irishman Henry Johnson, who fired his gun by resting the barrel on his stump\u2014these earlier voyages had proved largely uneventful. He\u2019d been sent to patrol the West Indies, generally considered the worst assignment in the Navy because of the specter of disease. The Saffron Scourge. The Bloody Flux. The Breakbone Fever. The Blue Death.But Cheap had endured. Wasn\u2019t there something to be said for that? Moreover, he\u2019d earned the trust of Anson and worked his way up to first lieutenant. No doubt it helped that they shared a disdain for reckless banter, or what Cheap deemed a \u201cvaporing manner.\u201d A Scottish minister who later became close to Cheap noted that Anson had employed him because he was \u201ca man of sense and knowledge.\u201d Cheap, the once-forlorn debtor, was but one rung from his coveted captaincy. And with the war with Spain having broken out, he was about to head into full-fledged battle for the first time.The conflict was the result of the endless jockeying among the European powers to expand their empires. They each vied to conquer or control ever larger swaths of the earth, so that they could exploit and monopolize other nations\u2019 valuable natural resources and trade markets. In the process, they subjugated and destroyed innumerable indigenous peoples, justifying their ruthless self-interest\u2014including the reliance on the ever-expanding Atlantic slave trade\u2014by claiming that they were somehow spreading \u201ccivilization\u201d to the benighted realms of the earth. Spain had long been the dominant empire in Latin America, but Great Britain, which already possessed colonies along the American eastern seaboard, was now on the ascendance\u2014and determined to break its rival\u2019s hold. Then, in 1738, Robert Jenkins, a British merchant captain, was summoned to appear in Parliament, where he reportedly claimed that a Spanish officer had stormed his brig in the Caribbean and, accusing him of smuggling sugar from Spain\u2019s colonies, cut off his left ear. Jenkins reputedly displayed his severed appendage, pickled in a jar, and pledged \u201cmy cause to my country.\u201d The incident further ignited the passions of Parliament and pamphleteers, leading people to cry for blood\u2014an ear for an ear\u2014and a good deal of booty as well. The conflict became known as the War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear.British authorities soon devised a plan to launch an attack on a hub of Spain\u2019s colonial wealth: Cartagena. A South American city on the Caribbean, it was where much of the silver extracted from Peruvian mines was shipped in armed convoys to Spain. The British offensive\u2014involving a massive fleet of 186 ships, led by Admiral Edward Vernon\u2014would be the largest amphibious assault in history. But there was also another, much smaller operation: the one assigned to Commodore Anson.With five warships and a scouting sloop, he and some two thousand men would sail across the Atlantic and round Cape Horn, \u201ctaking, sinking, burning, or otherwise destroying\u201d enemy ships and weakening Spanish holdings from the Pacific coast of South America to the Philippines. The British government, in concocting its scheme, wanted to avoid the impression that it was merely sponsoring piracy. Yet the heart of the plan called for an act of outright thievery: to snatch a Spanish galleon loaded with virgin silver and hundreds of thousands of silver coins. Twice a year, Spain sent such a galleon\u2014it was not always the same ship\u2014from Mexico to the Philippines to purchase silks and spices and other Asian commodities, which, in turn, were sold in Europe and the Americas. These exchanges provided crucial links in Spain\u2019s global trading empire.Cheap and the others ordered to carry out the mission were rarely privy to the agendas of those in power, but they were lured by a tantalizing prospect: a share of the treasure. The Centurion\u2019s twenty-two-year-old chaplain, Reverend Richard Walter, who later compiled an account of the voyage, described the galleon as \u201cthe most desirable prize that was to be met with in any part of the globe.\u201dIf Anson and his men prevailed\u2014\u201cif it shall please God to bless our arms,\u201d as the Admiralty put it\u2014they would continue circling the earth before returning home. The Admiralty had given Anson a code and a cipher to use for his written communication, and an official warned that the mission must be carried out in the \u201cmost secret, expeditious manner.\u201d Otherwise, Anson\u2019s squadron might be intercepted and destroyed by a large Spanish armada being assembled under the command of Don Jos\u00e9 Pizarro.Cheap was facing his longest expedition\u2014he might be gone for three years\u2014and his most perilous. But he saw himself as a knight-errant of the sea in search of \u201cthe greatest prize of all the oceans.\u201d And along the way, he might become a captain yet.Yet if the squadron didn\u2019t embark quickly, Cheap feared, the entire party would be annihilated by a force even more dangerous than the Spanish armada: the violent seas around Cape Horn. Only a few British sailors had successfully made this passage, where winds routinely blow at gale force, waves can climb to nearly a hundred feet, and icebergs lurk in the hollows. Seamen thought that the best chance to survive was during the austral summer, between December and February. Reverend Walter cited this \u201cessential maxim,\u201d explaining that during winter not only were the seas fiercer and the temperatures freezing; there were fewer hours of daylight in which one could discern the uncharted coastline. All these reasons, he argued, would make navigating around this unknown shore the \u201cmost dismaying and terrible.\u201dBut since war had been declared, in October 1739, the Centurion and the other men-of-war in the squadron\u2014including the Gloucester, the Pearl, and the Severn\u2014had been marooned in England, waiting to be repaired and fitted out for the next journey. Cheap watched helplessly as the days ticked by. January 1740 came and went. Then February and March. It was nearly half a year since the war with Spain had been declared; still, the squadron was not ready to sail.It should have been an imposing force. Men-of-war were among the most sophisticated machines yet conceived: buoyant wooden castles powered across oceans by wind and sail. Reflecting the dual nature of their creators, they were devised to be both murderous instruments and the homes in which hundreds of sailors lived together as a family. In a lethal, floating chess game, these pieces were deployed around the globe to achieve what Sir Walter Raleigh had envisioned: \u201cWhosoever commands the seas commands the trade of the world; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world.\u201dCheap knew what a cracking ship the Centurion was. Swift and stout, and weighing about a thousand tons, she had, like the other warships in Anson\u2019s squadron, three towering masts with crisscrossing yards\u2014wooden spars from which the sails unfurled. The Centurion could fly as many as eighteen sails at a time. Its hull gleamed with varnish, and painted around the stern, in gold relief, were Greek mythological figures, including Poseidon. On the bow rode a sixteen-foot wooden carving of a lion, painted bright red. To increase the chances of surviving a barrage of cannonballs, the hull had a double layer of planks, giving it a thickness of more than a foot in places. The ship had several decks, each stacked upon the next, and two of them had rows of cannons on both sides\u2014their menacing black muzzles pointing out of square gunports. Augustus Keppel, a fifteen-year-old midshipman who was one of Anson\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, boasted that other men-of-war had \u201cno chance in the world\u201d against the mighty Centurion.Yet building, repairing, and fitting out these watercraft was a herculean endeavor even in the best of times, and in a period of war it was chaos. The royal dockyards, which were among the largest manufacturing sites in the world, were overwhelmed with ships\u2014leaking ships, half-constructed ships, ships needing to be loaded and unloaded. Anson\u2019s vessels were laid up on what was known as Rotten Row. As sophisticated as men-of-war were with their sail propulsion and lethal gunnery, they were largely made from simple, perishable materials: hemp, canvas, and, most of all, timber. Constructing a single large warship could require as many as four thousand trees; a hundred acres of forest might be felled. Read more"

        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the author of Killers of the Flower Moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on The Wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.A Best Book of the Year: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, TIME, Smithsonian, NPR, Vulture, Kirkus Reviews\u201cRiveting...Reads like a thriller, tackling a multilayered history\u2014and imperialism\u2014with gusto.\u201d \u2014Time \"A tour de force of narrative nonfiction.\u201d \u2014The Wall Street JournalOn January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty\u2019s Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as \u201cthe prize of all the oceans,\u201d it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.But then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes \u2013 they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death\u2014for whomever the court found guilty could hang.The Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann\u2019s recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O\u2019Brian, his portrayal of the castaways\u2019 desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann\u2019s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An Extraordinary Tale.",
                "reviewText": "\u201cAs a tale gets passed from one person to another, it ripples out until it is as wide and mythic as the sea.\u201dThe annals of British naval history abound with great and small adventures alike. None, however, captivates like the extraordinary tale of the HMS Wager. And no one can better recount such a hair-raising series of events than David Grann. With \"The Wager,\" Grann tops his previous works of narrative nonfiction with this harrowing story of inconceivable hardship and the machinations of desperate men. To be sure, no incident contained in this book is without ample evidence proving it occurred.It is hard to imagine a more horrifying set of survival conditions than those faced by Wager's crew, and capturing those conditions accurately based on aging historical records and biased published accounts was undoubtedly tricky. Yet, Grann does yeoman's work on this story of the ill-fated Wager, part of a British squadron ordered to sea in August 1740 against the Spanish in the apocryphal \u201cWar of Jenkins\u2019 Ear.\" Commanding Wager and at the center of Grann's book is Captain David Cheap, a deeply flawed and complicated skipper.Like Grann's other books, \"The Wager\" nearly requires one to suspend disbelief. The author carefully and patiently reveals the story's events, shocking the reader in the process. Moreover, upon completing Grann's 257-page account of Wager's exploits and those of its sister ship, HMS Centurion, the reader better understands the ruthlessness and cunning demonstrated by the British Royal Navy as it navigated the high seas in quest of Empire. Indeed, British imperial ambitions are fully displayed in \"The Wager.\"Based mainly on seamen\u2019s logbooks and trial records, many of which are over 250 years old, Grann pieces together the seemingly doomed Wager\u2019s calamities while providing ample historical context. The author, for example, details the multitudinous threats facing British ships as they pursued the Empire's aims in the mid-18th century. He also describes shipboard conditions on a British man-of-war sailing the world's oceans during this era.Wager meets its fate while searching for a Spanish galleon laden with treasure and attempting to negotiate the treacherous seas off Cape Horn at the tip of the South American continent. The crew, already decimated by storms, scurvy, and sundry other trials, finds its ship dashed on the rocks off the coast of Patagonia, Argentina. Marooned in May 1741 with little hope of rescue, the men struggle to survive on a scabrous spit of land subsequently named Wager Island.Malnourished and desperate, Wager\u2019s surviving company suffers a complete breakdown in discipline and decorum. Having lost confidence in the ailing and unpredictable Cheap, still in command, the castaways defy British naval law and flout regulations. A fulminant Cheap, for his part, opposes the indiscipline and enforces his authority at the end of a pistol. A mutiny takes shape, and eventually, a breakaway faction, led by Gunner's Mate John Bulkeley, abandons Cheap and his loyalists, leaving them to fend for themselves on Wager Island. By this time, subsisting on the meagerest of diets harvested from terrain that barely sustains life while withstanding storm after storm, Cheap and crew somehow endure.Sailing a small transport boat reinforced with scrap lumber harvested from Wager and equipped with makeshift sails and rigging, Bulkeley and his charges successfully navigate the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. Meanwhile, Cheap and the Wager Island stragglers experience an equally implausible outcome. Sailing on an eighteen-foot yawl salvaged from the Wager, they set off to reach the Chilean coast. Surviving their respective ordeals, the two parties return to London, providing their lurid accounts of mutiny, betrayal, abandonment, and murder to an incredulous British Admiralty and fascinated public. They alternately face scorn and approbation and, eventually, court-martial.It is the Wager leadership\u2019s trial for which Grann saves his best narration and jaw-dropping, surprise ending.\"The Wager\" asks which of the stories is harder to believe: the death-defying travails and travels of these indomitable seamen or the unanticipated result as the British Admiralty adjudicates their fate. Yet, Grann provides the reader with all the evidence necessary to confirm these events happened irrefutably. Relying on an abundance of journals, logs, diaries, and even letters, Grann demonstrates again his seemingly unquenchable thirst for the truth to inform his audience. His single-spaced bibliography alone exceeds 13 pages.Without question, \"The Wager\" is an astonishing naval story reminiscent of Charles Nordhoff\u2019s and James Norman Hall\u2019s \u201cMutiny on the Bounty.\u201d Considering the inglorious actions of the Wager's crew, Grann's book is worth reading and rereading to comprehend the motives of desperate men. Experiencing the audacity and might of the 18th century British Royal Navy, particularly exemplified by Centurion as she squares off with the Spanish man-of-war Our Lady of Covadonga off the Philippines, provides immensely satisfying adventure reading. Grann's spellbinding account of the naval gunfight puts the reader in the crow's nest as though he is viewing the fight aboard the Centurion from the very mast top!\"The Wager\" offers an incredible piece of storytelling suitable for any devotee of narrative nonfiction or lover of naval lore.An extraordinary tale.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Grann's Gift as a Story-Teller on Full Display",
                "reviewText": "Grann\u2019s Gift as a Story-Teller on Full DisplayIn the first half of the 18th century, Britain already had the most powerful navy in the world. But financing that navy was a huge burden on the Crown and England had not yet achieved the wealth that the industrial revolution and its own colonization efforts would later bring. The answer: intercept the gold and silver that Spanish ships were bringing home from its New World colonies.Author David Grann is able to tell not only this larger story but also to resurrect one of the most astonishing seafaring events of the time. A ship named \u201cThe Wager\u201d was to be part of a British fleet that would intercept gold-laden Spanish vessels in what was officially-sanctioned piracy. As the book\u2019s cover indicates, what then transpired was shipwreck, mutiny and murder. This is also the story of unexpected survival and efforts in an Admiralty court back in England to establish the truth of what happened.Life on board a ship at the time, so full of danger and disease that it was not unusual for as few as ten percent of the crew to survive a long voyage, meant that the Royal Navy had great difficulty manning its ships. Grann provides graphic descriptions of able-bodied and not-so-able-bodied men being kidnapped off the wharfs (\u201cimpressed\u201d) to fill the complement of seamen just as a ship was about to sail. (Some years later the impressment of American seamen was a contributor to the War of 1812.)The hulls of wooden sailing ships had a very short life-span due to wood-eating worms, and were susceptible to leaks and other threats to seaworthiness. Scurvy could render entire crews incapable of functioning. Other communicable diseases could cause widespread death on board a crowded, ill-ventilated vessel.In the case of The Wager, the author was able to find a remarkable record of its 1740 voyage and of the events to come. This was in part due to the fact that on board as a junior officer was John Byron, a gentleman volunteer and a compulsive diarist. Incidentally, he was the grandfather of Lord Byron.Additionally, another major actor in the drama, John Bulkeley, had kept a voluminous diary which chronicled the events of the voyage. Buikeley held the position of Gunner, a crucial role in ship combat, and had many other responsibilities on board. He was an instinctive leader, physically imposing, who commanded respect.Finally, there was the record of the court-martial proceedings themselves, in which the main actors including David Cheap, the captain, provided their own version of events. Cheap was an ambitious, younger son of a Scottish Laird who, under the rules of primogeniture, did not inherit his father\u2019s estate. He ran off to sea at 17 and set his sights on becoming a captain, which he realized when an opening occurred on The Wager.The Wager survived the perilous passage around the treacherous Cape Horn, only to run aground and break up on the rocks of an uninhabited island off Patagonia. There were no animals or other significant source of food on the island. The crew soon divided into two factions, one supporting Captain Cheap who wanted to build a vessel out of timbers salvaged from the shipwreck and continue up the Pacific coast of South America to engage Spanish ships. The other group was led by Buckeley, who wanted to build a vessel to return to England. The situation was so dire it would seem impossible that either group would survive.Improbably a few men did make their way back to England to be hailed as heroes. That is, until a second group, including Captain Cheap, also arrived. This forms the final chapter of the story of The Wager and the launch of an inquiry to establish the truth.Faced by death by hanging if they were found guilty of mutiny or of discipline if they failed their duty, each survivor told his story. \u201cMembers of the Admiralty found themselves confounded by competing versions of events,\u201d the author tells us. The result was unexpected, but only if one fails to consider that the leaders of an institution, in this case the Royal Navy, have as their first priority the preservation of that institution and the protection of its reputation.This is a wonderfully-written book and Grann is a masterful story teller.",

C\u2019est la guerre mais ici il s\u2019agit uniquement du piratage d\u2019un galion espagnol charg\u00e9 de pi\u00e8ces d\u2019argent.L\u2019\u00e9criture de ce r\u00e9cit a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019auteur plusieurs ann\u00e9es de pr\u00e9paration, il a \u00e9pluch\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s nombreux documents d\u2019\u00e9poque que l\u2019on trouve cit\u00e9s dans une imposante bibliographie \u00e0 la fin du livre.C\u2019est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement historique qui n\u2019est pas pass\u00e9 inaper\u00e7u et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 par la suite romanc\u00e9 par plusieurs grands \u00e9crivains tel que Jules Verne, Daniel Defoe et Joseph Conrad.Le r\u00e9cit s\u2019\u00e9tale sur quelques quatre ann\u00e9es est dat\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un journal de bord tenu par l\u2019un des marin, jeune officier canonnier d\u00e9brouillard, qui a pris le commandement du navire lors d\u2019une une mutinerie. Malgr\u00e9 la crudit\u00e9 de certains d\u00e9tails dans cette histoire tragique, le courage de ces hommes revigore et capte l\u2019attention et en fait un r\u00e9cit passionnant.Il y a l\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 pour survivre de ces marins, sur une \u00eele de la c\u00f4te du Pacifique, que l\u2019on d\u00e9nommera Wager, pr\u00e8s du Chili, o\u00f9 le bateau a \u00e9chou\u00e9 en morceaux, laissant des marins sans beaucoup de provisions et en attente d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel secours.

Les dessous politique de l\u2019affaire, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats personnels de tous ces grands messieurs, et du gouvernement anglais de l\u2019\u00e9poque, sont tr\u00e8s bien explicit\u00e9s par cet auteur journaliste d\u2019enqu\u00eate.Avec tristesse l\u2019auteur termine par cette \u00e9valuation : \u2018finalement\u2019, \u00e9crit-il, (\u2026) \u2018ne restera ni de cette lutte f\u00e9roce qui a eu lieu \u00e0 cet endroit, ni des r\u00eaves ravageurs d\u2019empire(\u2026), rien d\u2019autre que quelques branches de c\u00e9leri que les naufrag\u00e9s avaient fait pousser (\u2026) et quelques planches de bois \u00e9chou\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00eele.\u2019",

                "reviewText": "I was listening to an abridged version of this book on BBC Radio 4 recently and then I stopped listening because I realised it would be better to read the book \u2013 and I\u2019m glad I did.This is a book about a squadron of Royal Navy ships that were despatched to South America to harass Spanish shipping during the oft-forgotten War of Jenkins\u2019s Ear in 1740 (when I was doing A Level History I was taught that it wasn\u2019t his ear but one of the family jewels that was sliced off by a Spanish swordsman). Their commander, Commodore George Anson, has secret orders to sail round Cape Horn and across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines to intercept and capture a Spanish galleon laden with tonnes of silver and gold extracted from Spain\u2019s colonies in the region.The expedition is a fiasco. The squadron sets off from Portsmouth months later than planned. Many of the crewmen have been pressganged and are untrained. They have only got as far as Madeira when they learn that the Spanish already know about their secret mission and are hunting the Atlantic for them. By the time they get down to Cape Horn the squadron is in a mess due to storms, typhus, scurvy, and damage to the ships. A couple of ships disappear, hundreds of sailors die from disease or drowning or are incapacitated due to sickness. The Wager is the least seaworthy ship and is wrecked on a tiny island off the coast of Chile that later became known as Wager Island. What follows is a kind of Lord of the Flies for adults. I won\u2019t spoil it by saying what happens. Obviously there are survivors \u2013 as the back cover announces \u2013 and that\u2019s how we know what happened. Or rather, we have several conflicting accounts of what happened. I will say that the back cover blurb doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. A third group of survivors eventually reach home some years later. Also the mission is not a complete disaster as some people emerge from the sea fog with untold riches.I haven\u2019t read any of David Grann\u2019s other books but I gather from the acknowledgements, the note on the sources, the end notes and the select bibliography that he is one of those journalists whose work is capable of verging on history. That means he engaged in extensive research of primary and secondary sources as well as picking the brains of several historians. He even spent three weeks on Wager Island to understand what the castaways went through. There are some jarring notes. Despite the extensive help from editors and historians, the author is not entirely familiar with naval terminology and \u2013 specifically \u2013 with terminology used on this side of the Atlantic. He often refers to an institution that doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 the British Navy \u2013 rather than the Royal Navy. That grates, even for a staunch republican like me. Direct quotations from the survivors are converted into American spelling, which also grates, but it would be wrong of me to whinge too much. It\u2019s a well-written book and a lot more than just a dramatic account of a ship wreck. The castaways are not just seamen, they are naval personnel and thus subject to the harsh discipline of the rope \u2013 used for flogging and hanging. They are also products of our class hierarchy and all the snobbery and nonsense that that involves. How some of them survived the ordeal is \u2013 pardon the clich\u00e9 \u2013 nothing short of a miracle.I\u2019ve seen some complaints about wokery from some reviewers. They seem to assume that 300 years ago there was a consensus about imperialism and slavery such that any right-thinking person at the time couldn\u2019t possibly have conceived of any alternative. That is far from being the case. There were plenty of people questioning what Britain and other European nations were doing sailing the seven seas. Ironically, a lot of that questioning was coming from Tories, like the great Samuel Johnson, who was hardly woke by any standards. It was the Whigs \u2013 now the Liberal Democrats in Britain \u2013 who were the party of trade and empire, while Johnson and other conservatives with a small \u201cc\u201d were deeply uncomfortable about slavery and our treatment of indigenous peoples.The author gives a practical example of the self-damaging consequences of colonial attitudes. The castaways are shivering and starving to death on Wager Island. A bunch of locals arrive from nowhere. Over the centuries they have developed the skills needed to survive in this hostile environment. They show the castaways how to catch fish and paddle around the stormy seas in flimsy canoes that don\u2019t break up and sink like the British ships and boats. In return some of the castaways try to harass the womenfolk and the locals paddle off. As a result dozens of men die who could possibly have survived if they had cooperated better with the locals. At a later date, several men are rescued by locals and taken hundreds of miles to safety. The author therefore makes a valid point when he complains that the survivors refer to these lifesavers as \u201csavages\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of irony there, given the behaviour of some of the castaways.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action and adventure, naval history, British history or to anyone who wants to know more about how human beings behave and survive in extreme circumstances.",
