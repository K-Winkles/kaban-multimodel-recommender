        "description": "The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius contain a wide range of fascinating spiritual insights and exercises developed as the leader strove to understand himself and make sense of the cosmos. They were written in Greek by an educated Roman emperor without any intention of publication. They cover a wide range of subjects, including the question of virtue, human rationality, the nature of the gods, and the principles of leadership, moving from doubt and despair to certainty and exaltation.",
