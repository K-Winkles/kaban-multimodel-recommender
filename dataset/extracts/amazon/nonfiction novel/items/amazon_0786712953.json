Everything these Zionists do is for Israel; to quote from the book: \"Mossad had files on all senior US politicians.\"-p. 90 (paperback)\"When Yitzhak Shamir would later say that no one had done more for Israel, he was not exaggerating.\"-p108\"...Shamir felt sufficiently close to Maxwell to confide in him his anti-Americanism.\"-p.35...\"the suspicion grew later in MI6 and MI5 that Maxwell could not be trusted. He was placed on their Watch List and categorised as 'a Zionist-loyal only to Israel'...\"-p.41\"...there could be no doubting Maxwell's commitment to Israel...\"-p.69\"Mossad was deeply involved in all these areas, operating the diktat David Kimche had articulated: 'In all we do it is Israel first, last and always. Always.'..\"-p.72That accusing some Jewish politicians of dual loyalty is met with charges of \"antisemitism\" is absurd. In fact, it isn't dual loyalty, it's SOLE loyalty to the motherland. Read and see why.Great book that reads like a spy novel!",

                "reviewText": "Through British citizen Robert Maxwell, vain, gross, brilliant and criminal, Thomas and Dillon paint a picture of corruption and decadence in the West, Eastern Europe and the Middle East today. Maxwell's loyalties are to himself and to Israel; Senator John Tower is in his pocket; and so forth. The United States, apart from furnishing the likes of Tower, furnishes the intelligence stolen by Israel and the subsidies that keep that country in business stealing from its patron. Maxwell is a kind of super sayan (singular form of sayanim) and the book to some degree is an expose of the extent to which these volunteers-for-Israel around the world do damage to their host countries.The Maxwell-Mossad team steals spy software PROMIS from the United States, Mossad puts an undetectable trap door in it so Mossad can track the activities of anyone using it, then Maxwell sells it around the world (including back to the U.S. -- with the trap door). When Maxwell finally goes bankrupt, the losses are passed on to \"the little people,\" while Israel and Maxwell's protected heirs remain in the black, at least materially. Thomas/Dillon present, in thrilling mystery adventure mode, the theory that Maxwell became a loose canon to his beloved Israel, among other things hitting on Mossad for a bigger pay-off, and its agents assassinated him.The authors, both top-notch investigative journalists, base their study on official documents and on interviews -- what they uncover is bound to shock and put on the alert anyone who loves his country, respects honesty, good will and just about any other virtue within its borders.",

                "reviewText": "From the minute I bought this book I could not put in down. Well researched and some gripping stories will sustain your interest in this book. The book goes into Maxwell's ties with Mossad and other intelligence agencies at the time. You really see Maxwell as a Jerkyll and Hyde character, but a man with tremendous influence and power. A must read.",
