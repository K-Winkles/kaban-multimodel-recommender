                "reviewText": "The disastrous 7 December 1941 attack is the subject of Steve White's PEARL HARBOR, A DAY OF INFAMY. Published by Rosen Publishing and Osprey Publishing in 2007, White's book is part of the 'Graphic Battles of World War II' series.After a short, 5-page introduction to the pre-war situation and the period immediately prior to 7 December, White and illustrator Jerrold Spahn tell the tale of the Pearl Harbor attack in graphic novel style. Historically, there are a few mistakes in White's text but nothing significant. While Spahn's artwork is pretty inaccurate, readers 9-12 should find it appealing. The book ends with a short, 2-page summary of events after 7 December.In short, PEARL HARBOR, A DAY OF INFAMY does help explain 7 December to younger readers and bring it to life. The information presented is fairly accurate and the graphics are eye-catching. Readers 9-12 should enjoy it. Recommended.",
