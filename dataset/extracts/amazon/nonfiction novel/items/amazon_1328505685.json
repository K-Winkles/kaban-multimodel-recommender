                "reviewText": "\ufeff\u201cIf you want a friend in Washington, get a dog!\u201d That was just one of Harry S. Truman\u2019s more memorable lines. The man from Larmar, Missouri, a farmer\u2019s son, had plenty more like that one. Truman, to put it in the popular lexicon, was a straight shooter from the old school. He knew how to cut to the chase and get things done. During WWI, Truman, at age 33, served as an artillery officer for Battery D company He saw action during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. At war\u2019s end, he was discharged with the rank of captain, much respected and admired by his troops, most of whom were \u201cIrish and German Catholics.\u201d One of them, \u201cEddie McKim, became one of Truman\u2019s lifelong friends,\u201d the author A. J. Baime writes. Baime described Truman this way: \u201cHe was the prototypical ordinary man. He had no college degree and never had enough money to own his own home.\u201d For a while he even lived in his mother-in-law\u2019s home, who \u201cnever liked Harry very much.\u201d Baime\u2019s book, published in 2017, is entitled: \u201cThe Accidental President: Harry S. Truman and the Four Months That Changed the World.\u201d Those \u201cfour months\u201d turned out to be truly action-packed. They helped to create the strong, resilient President Truman the nation and most of the world would come to know and respect. Truman, Baime underscores, became president \u201cby accident\u201d - his own words. In 1944, after serving as vice-president for 82 days, the then-president, Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), in office since 1933, died on April 12, 1945. World War II was still raging against Japan on the Eastern front and Nazi Germany in Europe. The Soviet Union, under the brutal dictator Josef Stalin, was our ally in that massive struggle. Truman had \u201cnever governed a state or served as mayor of a city.\u201d He was married in 1919, to Bess Wallace, and they had one child, Margaret. Thanks to the help of a then-powerful Missouri political boss, Tom Pendergast, Truman began, in the early 30s, his rise up the ladder to eventually the White House itself. No boss Pendergast, no White House for Harry! Pendergast got Truman a number of low level administrative posts in Jackson County Missouri, with state agencies, and one job with a bureau of the federal government. He then supported Truman\u2019s bid for a U.S. Senate seat in the 1934 election, which he shockingly won. In 1944, FDR picked Truman to be his running mate. \u201cThe die\u201d as Caesar once said, \u201cwas cast.\u201d Baime\u2019s book describes what the \u201cfirst four months of the Truman\u2019s presidency\u201d looked like. The term \u201cmind-boggling\u201d doesn\u2019t begin do it justice. It began, Baime writes, with the \u201ccollapse of Nazi Germany, then the founding of the United Nations, and the fire bombing of Japanese cities.\u201d The latter attacks killed thousand of civilians. The liberation of \u201cNazi death camps, the suicide of Adolf Hitler, and the execution of Benito Mussolini\u201d quickly followed. The Italian strong man was executed in the city of Milan by Communist partisans. He was then hanged by his feet along side his murdered mistress, Claretta Petacci. Their \u201cdeath photo\u201d was truly a shocking thing to see. It may have been the first time I had ever seen a dead body outside of a funeral home. In Germany, the capture of war criminals, such as \u201cHermann Goring and Ernst Kaltenbrunner and the fall of Berlin\u201d are all covered in Baime\u2019s book. On the Eastern front, Baime noted the \u201cvictory at Okinawa, which Bill Sloan, a historian, called \u2018the deadliest campaign of conquest ever undertaken by American arms.\u2019\u201d While that battle was raging, a Japanese suicide plane crashed into the \u201cUSS Bunker Hill,\u201d killing nearly 400 American sailors. The author reported, \u201cIt would take 800,000 U.S. troops\u201d to invade Japan. General George Marshall had \u201cset D-Day as November 1st.\u201d The above was soon followed by the \u201cPostdam Conference, during which the new president sat at the negotiating table with Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin in Soviet-occupied Germany in an attempt to map out a new world.\u201d Unfortunately, Stalin resisted that effort. Instead, a \u201cCold War\u201d would ensue, writes the author. The first four months of Truman\u2019s presidency were all highly-charged with international tensions of every variety and filled with important, seminal events. Author Baime brings them all to life again. They were all ultra-charged, the author submits, by Truman\u2019s controversial decision, \u201cto drop the first atomic bombs on two Japanese cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August, 1945. Those monumental actions \u201cdid end the war with Japan\u201d and prevented the loss of an estimated hundreds of thousand of American lives from a land invasion. They also ushered in \u201cthe dawn of the Cold War and the beginning of nuclear arms race,\u201d Baime reports. The dropping of the A bombs also led the Japanese to begin the release of its American and Ally POWs, including a hero son of Baltimore - Harry S. Agro. To this day, unlike Germany, Japan has had a difficult time confronting and owning up fully to its criminal past and massive crimes. Meanwhile, seventy-five years later, memorials are still being held for the atomic bombs\u2019 estimated 200,000 victims, along with repeated calls to ban nuclear weapons. During this four months period of his presidency, \u201cfifty delegates signed the U.N. Charter in San Francisco. President Truman addressed the delegates in the city\u2019s War Memorial Veterans Building.\u201d Today, the UN is a thriving bastion for international peace and security. It has 193 member states. It\u2019s not perfect, but with the goodwill of its member states, it can be, and often is, effective. Truman along the way hired his own man to be Secretary of State - James F Byrnes. By then our country had also successfully tested its A-bomb in the desert of New Mexico. At the Postdam conference, Truman made it a point to tell Stalin to his face the U.S. had an atomic bomb. Up to that point, Stalin had been making off-the-wall demands about the future of Poland and Germany and on other issues. Truman\u2019s strategy worked, Stalin backed off. Finally, I grew up as a teenager with Harry Truman as my president. This book by A. J. Baime examines and explains many of the critical issues that confronted him early in his presidency. He does it in a fair and balanced way. I liked Truman then and I like him even more now. I\u2019m giving Baime four out of five stars for his fine literary effort.",

                "reviewText": "This isn't a biography from cradle to the grave, which,lets be honest -spend too many pages on tedious stuff, this mainly covers a few months when Truman went from not even a household name in his family to the most powerful man on the planet taking momentous decisions almost daily.In his first four months of his presidency he had seen Germany defeated, spent days horse trading with Churchill and Stalin (one of them would have been too much for most politicians) on what Europe would look like post-war and give permission to drop two nuclear bombs that forced Japan to surrender. Throw in the first seeds about the state of Israel being created and Truman's decisions still have huge consequences today.Throw in the fact he never wanted to be President and his wife hated the idea all the while he was in office nakes the title completely accurate of someone who was thrust into office and power and judging by this book did a pretty good job under circumstances probably no world leader had seen before or since.",

                "reviewText": "Harry Truman's selection as Franklin Roosevelt's running mate in 1944 was a big surprise to everyone, including Truman himself. Roosevelt was in poor health and was not expected to live out his term and the nation was still fighting a two front war. Truman, a former haberdasher and failed businessman from Missouri, did not inspire confidence as a replacement for the iconic FDR at such a precarious time in history. When Roosevelt died in April of 1945, Truman told reporters that it \"felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\"Longtime Wall Street Journal contributor A. J. Baime tells the story of Harry Truman's remarkable transition from county politician to leader of the free world in The Accidental President: Harry S. Truman and the Four Months that Changed the World. This is a remarkably well-researched account of the beginning of the Truman Presidency and the end of the Second World War, a war that was ended by the most controversial wartime decision likely made by any president: the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan in August of 1945.Baime begins with an accounting of the day that Vice-President Truman became President Truman, before embarking on Truman's life story, told in the perfect amount of detail, enough to know how Harry Truman became the man that would come to confront the world's greatest problems. The author introduces the 33rd President to the reader in his many dimensions: Truman the family man, Truman the Jacksonian Democrat, Truman the poker-playing good old boy. Baime's accounting of Truman's first four months as President puts the reader right in the Oval office and paints a picture of a Harry Truman as a man who makes decisions quickly, without wavering. He also provides a fascinating account of the relationship between Truman and Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, and has the reader shadow Truman at the historic Potsdam Conference.This book is not only about Truman. It also ably tells the story of the development and the deployment of the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Baime has the wonderful ability to make the reader that he or she is witnessing these events as they occur from close vantage. His accounting of the actions and emotions of the crew of the Enola Gay (the plan from which the first atomic bomb fell) is fascinating. His extensive use of Truman's diaries, as well as the personal first-hand accounts of many of the participants who were present at these events enhances the reader's feeling of watching these events at the time of their occurrence. Baime also has that wonderful author's gift of being able to tell the reader something he or she did not know before. For example, we learn of Joseph Stalin's revelation to Truman of the Russian leader's belief that Adolf Hitler was alive and living in South America, or of how Truman dressed down a sleazy army officer who offered to act as a pimp for the President at Potsdam.At times, Baime seems too enamored with Truman to consider that his subject may have had faults. Truman was schooled in the bare-knuckled political academy of the corrupt Pendergast machine and while the author acknowledges the shady dealings of this organization, he is convinced of Truman's absolute honesty. Truman made a lot of snap decisions, and while he was decisive, the author never questions whether Truman was too hasty at times in some of these snap judgements. But it is hard to question the author's objectivity, given the depth of his research and the completeness of his description of the circumstances surrounding the challenges Truman faced. The author provides an especially well-considered post mortem of Truman's decision to unleash the first nuclear weapons, providing his own defense of why he believes Truman was correct in doing so.Baime serves up excellent history in telling a remarkable story of unique circumstances that placed the under-estimated ordinary guy from Independence in the position of having to shape the world that we live in today. He does so in a manner that is thorough and complete, informative and insightful, and which makes the reader feel present and close at some of the most interesting events in recent history.",
