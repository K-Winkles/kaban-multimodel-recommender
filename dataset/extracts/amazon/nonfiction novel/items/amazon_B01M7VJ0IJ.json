The book is broken into sections, each one illuminating a different affordance of film.Of course, the book is profligate with examples, with film including early examples up to titles released in recent years. I would use this book as a teacher of media, but also found it informative and useful as a reader.",

                "reviewText": "I teach filmmaking to teenagers, so I am always on the lookout for new teaching tools and resources. This is an excellent introduction to film theory for young people who have developed an enthusiasm for movies but know nothing about film studies. Not only is the graphic approach fun, fast and easy to understand but Ross has essentially created a superb illustrated bibliography here for those wanting a jumping off place into more in-depth study. If I taught an undergraduate college course in film history or appreciation, this would be required reading\u2014I would also give it to advanced high school students.My one beef with Ross's approach is that I find him to present a number of popular critical positions somewhat uncritically himself. There is a lot of pleasure and enrichment to be had in movies that may be, for one reason or another, \"problematic,\" from within a certain context. For some students, this book might lead to pre-judgement of works they have not experienced first hand.Overall, though, if taken for the many ways it is useful and enjoyable, an excellent guide.",

                "reviewText": "This book is fine, and not a waste of time. Still, if you're interested in learning about film, you're better off watching The Story of Film (actually, do this anyway) or reading any of a number of other introductory texts (Amazon will likely point you in the right direction). If you're interested in the graphic info-novel format, this might be a good bet for you, though I question the idea of trying to talk about film using a combination of simple pictures and sparse text -- I could imagine this format working, but I don't think it does in this case. Also, this is just my personal taste, but I also didn't love (a) the prose [it tended towards the cliche and vague] or (b) the omnipresence of the narrator's (authors?) face.",
