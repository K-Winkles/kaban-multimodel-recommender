                "reviewText": "Jonathan Fetter-Vorm\u2019s \u201cMoonbound: Apollo 11 and the Dream of Spaceflight\u201d continues his works of historical summary in graphic novel format, including previous works \u201cBattle Lines\u201d and \u201cTrinity,\u201d each of which helps expand historical knowledge with the accessibility of the visual format for both academics and lay audiences. Fetter-Vorm alternates between the events of the Apollo 11 Moon landing and the history of astronomy \u2013 with particular attention to astronomy examining the Moon \u2013 as well as the Moon\u2019s place in culture, from religious iconography to early science-fiction. Fetter-Vorm begins in the earliest mythologies of humanity before transitioning to the Renaissance with Johannes Kepler. From there, he shows how the science that made the Moon landing possible built upon centuries of knowledge and the work of hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of mathematicians, engineers, and more. Fetter-Vorm warns, \u201cIn the decades since [1969], nostalgia has obscured just how divisive the Apollo program actually was\u201d (pg. 233).Complicating the narrative of space exploration amid the other issues of the 1960s, Fetter-Vorm writes, \u201cAlthough the Apollo Program coincided with the Civil Rights movement, NASA was slower than the rest of the country to integrate\u201d (pg. 152). Discussing the place of the Moonshot against the backdrop of the Cold War and domestic strife, Fetter-Vorm argues, \u201cGoing to the Moon was never about the Moon itself. Going to the Moon was a quest. And like any quest, the quarry was largely symbolic\u201d (pg. 157). Tying his narrative threads together, linking Apollo to the earlier role of the Moon in mythology and popular culture, Fetter-Vorm writes, \u201cWorking backward, if there\u2019s one day a month when the light is just right, and if it takes three days to get from the Earth to the Moon, then that\u2019s your launch window. The world that Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins were preparing to leave looked little like it did in the time of Johannes Kepler, and yet, in one essential way, three centuries had changed nothing: to the Moon, and its age-old arc across the heavens, these men were inescapably bound\u201d (pg. 190). The result is a work that will appeal to historians, comic book aficionados, and particularly teachers looking for an accessible way to delve deeply into this topic with their students. A great third book from Fetter-Vorm!",

                "reviewText": "With the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon quickly approaching, Jonathan Fetter-Vorm\u2019s new graphic novel Moonbound: Apollo 11 and the Dream of Space couldn\u2019t be more timely.Fetter-Vorm\u2019s new book is a smart, detailed exploration of how the dream of space travel has obsessed humanity over the eons while showing the steps it took to create the moon landing. His attention to detail is compelling and works well as an introduction to the history of space flight, spanning from Johannes Kepler to Jules Verne, from obscure Russian missile scientists to Verner Von Braun. In doing so, Fetter-Vorm touches on some of the major sociological events in which these men were involved.Importantly, Fetter-Vorm also takes side trips to highlight the work women and African-Americans contributed to the exploration of space, especially during the time NASA was a key part of the space program. He delivers interesting anecdotes and provides important context to explain the racial and gender divides of the 1960s which help exclude women and non-whites from the space program. For instance, Fetter-Vorm depicts the fact of how NASA mainly chose white scientists because their facilities were in the South. He also tells a fascinating story about how women were hired as \u201ccomputers\u201d, literally people who computed numbers based on scientific research. In doing so, Fetter-Vorm introduces readers to Margaret Hamilton, who wrote all the computer code used pilot the space vehicles.The author also takes pains to include the stories of the Russian space program in with the American stories, a nice touch which adds an important element to the tale. One of my favorite aspects of this book was when Fetter-Vorm shows how American Cold War propaganda deliberately ignored the considerable and impressive achievements of the Russians in space.Juxtaposed with all this fascinating history is a step-by-step depiction of the moon landing. Rendered in color rather than in the single-color tones of the historical parts of the book, these sequences seem to pop from the page in technicolor brightness and absolute joy. If the historical parts of the book provide the brains of this story, the sequences about the moon landing provide its heart. Readers can practically see the exhilaration on the faces of the astronauts as they orbit then land on the moon, and we are swept along with that excitement.Fetter-Vorm\u2019s art and coloring are perfect for a book of this type, providing just the right amount of detail to highlight the events but leaving the reader to fill in some of the gaps. For instance, he appropriately draws the dark side of the moon as a completely black mystery, and many of his historical scenes eschew backgrounds in order to keep focus on the man story.Moonbound is a historical drama which provides an excellent exploration and introduction to the American space program.",
