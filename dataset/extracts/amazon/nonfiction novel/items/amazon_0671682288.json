                "reviewText": "OK, never done this but here goes! When this book was given to me 4 years ago by a woman, I was so depressed I was barely able to get out of bed in the mornings. I was broke, friendless nor could I maintain good friendships, could not find a good job nor hold one down... everything I touched withered. I read the book skeptically, being that, while I believe in god or a higher power, I am not into Jesus (don't want to offend anyone). OK, at first I said an affirmation/prayer in a joking \"yeah right why not\" way but it worked. Tried another and it worked. I realized in surprise something was working so started doing it more. My thinking began to change. Fast forward a few months I got and held a good job with WONDERFUL people. Made friends. In 2 years got promoted and a big raise, in 6 months another promotion and raise. Then I started realizing some lifelong dreams. I had felt helpless but here I suddenly got my drivers license, bought a house, bought a car, all for the first time in my life. I got lots of cool furniture for the house as a gift from a neighbor, people have helped me in SO many ways and I've now given away 4 copies of this book to other people. It works. Period, end of story.HERE IS AN UPDATE IN 2013:I still often refer to this book. It always gets me back on track if I slip. It literally helps you out of any jam in life. Any situation, and any problem. Just pick up the book and read a page. It gives you the right way to think. It is a beautiful book, the only one I always turn to, it's always out on my coffee table, near at hand. And I gave away even more copies over the years. I can truly say that after reading this book, which at first I had no interest in and thought it was BS, I can tell you my life never was the same again and my friends and family know about all the \"magic\" wishes and things that often happen to me. When something goes wrong, I do as Florence would advise, I think of her and say phrases from her book, and all is swiftly made right again! Love it!HERE IS AN UPDATE IN 2016:The magic continues in my life. In 2015 at age 40 I married my wonderful boyfriend of 3 years. We bought a wonderful home at an amazing price from wonderful people. The house was everything we wanted but thought we couldn't afford. We easily conceived, and at age 41 after a happy, healthy pregnancy I gave birth to our sweet baby girl. After a lifetime of sorrow, pain, and failure in love and life, I am happy, healthy and blessed. As Florence says: \"wonders shall follow wonders and miracles shall never cease.\"Buy this book and just try to put in into practice. Just dip your toe into the waters. It may just turn your life around!I'm baaaack! It's 2023 and I STILL flip through my book every morning or whenever I need wisdom or solutions. My marriage is still devoted, mutually supportive, and loving. We had another baby when I was 46 and everything went so well! Our home is in order and we are all in good health. This book continues to help me connect to God on a daily basis. No problem is too big or too small to ask Infinite Intelligence for the divine solution! I find it prevents me from attempting to manipulate situations (thereby making them worse), because we, as humans, may have limited understanding of a situation, we think we know the answer, but God sees all and understands all, and knows the perfect solutions. I can't say enough how beautifully and intricately problems are resolved in elegantly intricate ways I could never have concocted myself. It is a power with such genius, it knows no bounds. I continue to be amazed, inspired, comforted, and recommend it to loved ones. Pro tip: It will get you out of a pickle, FAST! If you find yourself in a jam, in a conundrum, try it. Florence knew how to help people connect to God's infinite wisdom and power.",

I've read it several times and will likely continue to do so when I need a reminder of the power of words/thoughts. It's starting to sink in! I used to fell like I had bad luck so I would get jealous when others win things but now I just smile & say 'What God has done for others he now does for me and more'. I genuinely feel happy for others. Oh and I'm the lucky one now, constantly putting that out into the universe! Recently I won a $5000 raffle from a local dealership. What God has done for me, he now does for you...and more! Get the book, you won't regret it :)",

                "reviewText": "Mrs, Shinn is excellent in giving new creative positive affirmations. In some few areas of her writings she leads the reader into keeping our negative thoughts at bay. For me this is the greatest thing she does. And how does she do this? She shares her ideas much as Emmet Fox did in his book The Sermon on the Fox or Manley Halls booklet The Sermon On The Mount An Interpretation. And that was to emphasize Jesus teaching do not judge less you be judged. We all would have more inner peace if we took Jesus command. The previous two books especially Manley Halls booklet puts Jesus command as a healthy spiritual directive that we need to us many many times each day.The trick is to see how many times we do judge during the day. Then we can see how many times we need to remind ourselves to not judge. Gandhi said he did not learn true spirituality from Christians. He learned it from Buddahists. When the Chinese Communists came down in 1951 and killed and tortured thousands of Buddhist monks, the Buddhists and the Dela Lama never said anything critical about that. Through this example Gandhi based his non violence treatment of England and won Indias independence.How can we not pay paramount attention to this spiritual directive?",

For a non native English you should expect some words you might not be familiar with, because it has some old fashion words. But it did not get me stuck. It\u2019s good to have as it\u2019s the 4 in 1 as in a few of the chapters it mentions about one of the books inside of the other, so you have all on hand and can have easy access to the pages of the other books.",

Yes it refers constantly to God but you can interchange the term God with any deity you are more comfortable with. I would recommend reading this before falling for paying out lots of money to people who guarantee that by paying them they will make you rich, happy etc. The message in these books is you are the one with the power to change the circumstances of your life and gives you ways to do so.",
