I made so many of the recipes! I feel that some of the recipes may need adjustment in the ginger/garlic/onion department (especially ginger as it's just listed in inches but as you know, ginger roots come in all sizes). I've been really enjoying each page though, and each time I make a new batch, it gives me confidence in the next one! I'm hoping the next book is \"Let's Make Egg Rolls\" :)Check this book out, it's really fun and the recipes are really simple!",

Ce sont toutes des images dessin\u00e9es, style \u00ab bande dessin\u00e9e \u00bb. Il est donc tr\u00e8s simple de suivre toutes les \u00e9tapes. On retrouve une grande quantit\u00e9 de recettes diverses. Personnellement j\u2019aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir une \u00ab vrai image \u00bb \u00e0 la fin de chaque recette, afin de mieux voir l\u2019assiette final, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019avoir un \u00ab dessin \u00bb de l\u2019assiette\u2026 mais c\u2019est un choix personnel! Pour le reste, c\u2019est un beau livre, il y a des recettes de toutes sortes, et toutes les \u00e9tapes sont tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 suivre. Tr\u00e8s satisfaite.",

Also came in a paper envelope which had got wet on one side and dissolved part of the envelope.However miraculously, the book was bone dry. there was what appeared to be a water stain, but a quick Google search revealed that it was a design element. Got it at a price of 588 which was a steal as other sellers are selling it for more than twice this amount.Got this book after purchasing the Ramen book by the same authors. Good investment. Also good quality pages and lovely comic book style steps.Uses a lot of pork which I prefer to eat only occasionally, besides too much work for a single person, unless you are having guests over. This is true of the ramen book too, unless you have the option of a large refrigerator/freezer to make stock and freeze it.The book has a sticker for Rs 799 and the printed price on the book is USD 19.99 /CAD 25.99",
