Also - one of the only illustrations of the war that paid a great deal of attention to the appearance of major Vietnamese figures such as Giap, Ky, etc.I recommend this for anyone who wants an overview of the war without suffering loss of major details. Only point I would make as a negative is that there is an anti-Johnson bias and many defenses of Nixon.",

                "reviewText": "The visuals in this book are extremely well done. You can almost smell the jungle, the rain, the hippies.The information on the Cold War and the background in Indochina is very good. The military research that must have gone into these illustrations is sensational. The way the images are presented - overhead, underneath, action-packed: the graphic format is extremely well done.The book is lopsided. It presents media myth as truth. For example YES, Walter Cronkite DID lie to America that Tet had been an American defeat. NO, Johnson did NOT say, \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.\"For all the information given about student demonstrations, riots, Abbie Hoffman, and SDS, somehow the author fails to mention that the disgraceful anti-war movement in America was funded and led by the communists, coordinated to dispirit and manipulate the American public. This isn't secret knowledge, but somehow it doesn't find its way into this book. This book treats the antiwar movement as... praiseworthy. Bad.This book would have been better if it had presented a few individual acts of valor and honor. Keep the political backstory, but add the names and actions of Americans who served with distinction. There are so many gripping Medal of Honor citations from the Vietnam War. It is a shame this book bypasses them entirely in order to tell the political story. Beautiful renderings of the Wall.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, let it be known that this is not a comic book at all but actually a historical text covering the history and events of the Vietnam Conflict that happens to be illustrated.Whilst obviously not as detailed as the many text books availible which look at the war, is still suprisingly in depth and provides an excellent general introduction to the conflict for the novice, covering all of the major political decisions, events, issues and battles of the conflict both in Vietnam and on the home front in an honest and objective way, and contains plenty of actual dialogue, statements and quotes from the major historical figures involved during he war.The art by Wayne Vansant (who previously contributed to the 1980's Marvel series 'The Nam'), whilst rough in style and presented only in black and white, is well suited to the book, dramatic and historically accurate, and the book is absolutely packed with illustrations accompanied by the relative historical facts and information.The book itself is 'digest' sized hardcover with a full cover dust jacket. Its neat and compact, and ideal to carry with you and read whilst travelling, or alternatively as a 'coffee table' book.Highly recommended!",
