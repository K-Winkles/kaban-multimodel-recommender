                "reviewText": "Halfway through this book upon the discovery of yet another gut-punching line of prose, after already half-a-dozen run ins with nuggets of advice I\u2019d want to remember forever and words that made we shudder with thought-provoking excitement, I realized that I should\u2019ve read along with a highlighter and little sticky tabs. \u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063I\u2019ve never been the kind of reader to graffiti a book with bleeding highlights and colorful tabs littered throughout its pages. And I never understood those who did either. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s ruin something fun by turning it into homework\u2026\u201d\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063But like confetti, celebratory thrown into the air, HOW TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL dazzled me\u2014with its honesty, wisdom, and flat out artistry for writing. Each essay something shiny made to celebrate something about the self and about life. But though confetti glitters, it's also sharp around the edges. These essays remind us of that\u2014that while there's a beauty to life and to the self, both can still cut back. \u2063As writer this book felt like a treasure map, and as a person this book felt like a magic mirror from some kind of twisted fairy tale\u2014a mirror I could see myself in but one that could also see me right back.\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063I finished the second half of this book without a highlighter. Instead I ended the book with a folder in my iPhone called \u201cSusan,\u201d filled with snapshots of pages and lines I hope to never forget. Now the only thing left to do is reread the first half of the book and fill Susan with photos of the lines I missed the first time. \u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063",

I liked the memoir approach to offering, in general, subtle advice on writing. Not sure I\u2019ll reread it as a guidebook but it was inspiring. And I like and admire the guy :)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Three Books in One: An Essential Read",
                "reviewText": "This book is essential reading for writers and those who love books. It is really three books: 1. How to Write, a primer on what makes writing powerful, moving, evocative, urgent, and necessary. The lessons in this portion of the book are some of the most important and well-explained tidbits. In two cases, Chee took old axioms I've heard again and again and showed me the rationale behind them--why the are true--and now I understand them. 2. Autobiographical, an exploration of Chee's life, in which he has borne witness to exceptional moments, who has wrestled with a complicated past and rendered all of those moments so clearly it feels as though we are being told a richly drawn secret. I don't know what it is quite yet, but there is something about the way this book is written that feels both exceptionally public and deeply intimate. Reading it is like going on the best first five dates of your life. Chee is one of our best public intellectuals, made stronger by the fact that I don't think he sees himself as more than a careful observer. 3. Novel, a cohesive story of many moving parts, one that coalesces into a sum greater than those parts. There is Chee, the protagonist, and his first novel, a sometimes antagonist, and in some ways this book of essays evokes Odysseus making his way back home--a long journey with many sidetracks, each of which enriches the story told and deepens our experience.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this book 6 months ago and then felt guilty for not picking it up every time I passed my shelf. So when I pulled this title out of my book jar two weeks ago, I was relieved. And then I started reading it and was even more relieved, because this was absolutely the right time to encounter this book. A beautifully moving collection of essays, Chee's nonfiction debut ranges from the front lines of AIDS activism in 1990s San Francisco to the search for purpose when teaching writing in a post-9/11 New York. Personally, I will treasure the essay on studying under Annie Dillard until the day I die, but pretty much every essay in this book is the best. The final installment, \"On Becoming an American Writer,\" is perhaps the most convincing argument I've read in favor of nurturing creativity in our increasingly entropic world. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. I'll be rereading it many times.",

                "reviewText": "In Alexander Chee\u2019s HOW TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL, he goes deep into his past, his boyhood, life as a student, the years leading up to becoming a writer, and a trauma that he gently reveals as he discovered he was not really past the pain as he had not yet acknowledged the hurt.In the book, Chee\u2019s dedication to his craft, and how using his own stories and sharing his beliefs, enabled him to become a better writer. It is clear how immensely talented he is not only in the way his written words so effortlessly seep into you, but in the way, he pours his heart and soul into this book. It is a gift to his fellow writers as well as to any reader who appreciates how a book comes to life. It is both encouraging and wise. It is the stuff of what makes readers admire authors for the hard work that they do and how we, as readers, fall in love with great books.",
