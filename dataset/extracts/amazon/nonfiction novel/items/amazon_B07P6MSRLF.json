        "description": "The original serialized version was published in 1894 and then privately in 1920. The purpose of this audiobook is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one goal admitted by all scriptures. But this basic truth is one not easily comprehended. The discord existing between the different religions, and the ignorance of men, make it almost impossible to lift the veil and have a look at this grand verity. The creeds foster a spirit of hostility and dissension; ignorance widens the gulf that separates one creed from another. Only a few specially gifted persons can rise superior to the influence of their professed creeds and find absolute unanimity in the truths propagated by all great faiths. Read more",

This makes reading quick and easy unlike some old Indian texts that unfortunately seem to go on forever saying the same thing over and over again for 5000 pages. Straight to the point. He shares his love for the bible too! Great read, very thin book can easily finish in a couple of hours but worth it for the knowledge. Namaste \ud83d\ude4f",

Je pense que l'ouvrage est - par lui-m\u00eame - profond\u00e9ment instructif. Ses commentaires sur l'astrologie et sur les \"Yugas\" me semblent fort int\u00e9ressants. Les commentaires \u00e9tablissent \u00e9galement des parall\u00e8les saisissants entre l'hindouisme et le christianisme. A priori, il me semble que le grand m\u00e9rite de cet ouvrage est de vouloir \"montrer aussi clairement que possible qu'il y a une unit\u00e9 essentielle dans toutes les religions\".",
