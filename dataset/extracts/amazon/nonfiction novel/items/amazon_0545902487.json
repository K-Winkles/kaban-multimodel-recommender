                "reviewText": "I absolutely loved this graphic novel. Don\u2019t let the cartoon-like cover fool you, it is a coming-of-age memoir filled with quite a few depressing moments. I didn\u2019t notice the full title of the book until I started writing this review. I would say that this is meant for a more mature audience, middle grade and higher. My husband attended college in Worcester, Mass (where the author grew up), so I was always curious about this graphic novel and Jarrett Krosoczka. I love seeing him on his social media posts wearing his Boston Red Sox cap. I think this was a thought-provoking book and it gives an honest presentation of what it\u2019s like to grow up with relatives battling addiction. The book is a great story of perseverance and living your dream. So awesome that J. Krosoczka is making a living doing his dream job, as an author and illustrator. Honestly, I cannot wait to read his next memoir, Sunshine.",

His grandparents raised him and he looked to them as his parents and created a bond so tight with them her will never forget. It was such an amazing read and the author put so much detail into his pictures and included real notes and picture into the chapters and had meaning behind certain things in his story like in the chapter breaks he includes pineapple wallpaper that was in this grandmothers kitchen.",

Krocozska describes with words and in images a dysfunctional upbringing filled with pain and love and hope, with an end that is satisfying. In treatment, my counselors told us 90 percent of families are damaged. It makes me sad, but it is inspiring to know they can be repaired if not totally restored.I\u2019d like to teach this book in my middle school reading class; I probably won\u2019t because of the language and adult content, but I know many of my students would relate to young Ja.",

                "reviewText": "My grandson is now a senior in high school. I have raised him since he was 18 months old due to addiction. He is awesome, smart, kind, and talented. This story is very similar to Jarrett's. But my grandson does not want to talk about it. He explained the reason to his therapist: \"I just don't care.\" His mother is on her death bed due to drugs/alcohol.I know \"I don't care\" is not the same as \"It doesn't affect me.\" It affects us all. It is part of what makes us who we are.We need to make peace with whatever emotions it brings to us--even \"I don't care.\" That's not easy for a young man in high school. I read HELLO KIDDO and hoped my grandson would read it too. I left it on the sofa table hoping he might pick it up on his own. When I finished it, I took it to him and before I could say anything, he says \"I am not going to read it.\" I asked if he knew what it is about and he revealed that he had read the back cover. I left it with him and suggested he consider it because it is a really good book, starts a little slow (if you don't know the background--I heard the NPR interview) but soon picks up. It is basically \"our story\" -- as I am sure it is for many families.Thank you, Jarrett, for sharing your story in such a readable form. It is a beautiful work.How do we get it read by those who need it most -- the kids suffering through it? It's therapy for the grandparents too!",

The whole thing felt like making a new close friend and a little like a therapy session. It's so clear the author poured his heart into this book.",
