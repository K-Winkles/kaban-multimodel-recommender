Rowson actually made a story out if the text and made some good additional notes that add some context from the future, since this text was written so long ago. Its crazy how long ago it was written to be honest because it could've been written today. The only critique I have is that parts of the pictures are hard to see sometimes because of the crease in the center of the pages from the binding. However, thats just a normal book thing, no fault of the printing or anything.",

                "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars Adds very little to reading experience",
                "reviewText": "This adaptation correctly identifies that the Communist Manifesto is one of the most influential works ever written but goes out of it's way to dismiss and deride those who were influenced by it! It features images of what are clearly Soviet soldiers goose stepping in front of a statue of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels while birds defecate on the statue.This kind of gross dismissal of existing socialism by people who purport to have been inspired by Marx works only to maintain the status quo. Especially portraying a Soviet soldier doing a Nazi goose step when 20 million soviet soldiers died to defeat fascism in Europe. What an insult to the millions of communists who struggled and fought for the vision of Karl Marx.Otherwise this is simply what it says it is: The text of the Communist Manifesto along side some very detailed (but extremely grim) artwork. If you have never read the Communist Manifesto before then this adds some editorializing that I don't think would make a good first reading. If you've read it before then maybe you might enjoy the artwork but otherwise I don't think there is much to get out of this that wouldn't be gained out of just reading the text (which is available for free everywhere) without the art.",
