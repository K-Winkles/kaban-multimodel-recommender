                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Book is absolutely incredible, physical format is a tad frustrating...",
                "reviewText": "In the vast sea of How-To comics books, this is a gem. Most books are pretty much the same re-hash of material with a different face. Here's basic tools, here's basic anatomy, here's basic perspective, here's a little figure drawing, tweak to fit a genre, done. So many of these books are out there. Few and far between, however, are books that actually offer new and more in-depth information about comics creating that can't really be found elsewhere. This is that book. This book really breaks down what makes comics and goes in depth with the various techniques involved with creating comics (both writing and drawing). It goes beyond the simple, this is how you draw, or this is what you should be making marks with, and really tells you useful things that are applicable to the actual work involved with producing comics. I keep coming back this book (and it's sequel) and picking up new information. Comics is a journey and it's nice that there is a book out there that really has something to offer for comics creators.That said, the physical format of the book is a little frustrating. It is super wide (24 inches when open), and completely awkward to read unless you have it laying down on a desk or a table. I'm not really sure why they do this -- I feel like they could have easily made it into a more convenient shape -- there are frequent instances of pages where there is only a little writing in the corner with vast blank areas, so I'm just wondering... why?!? I dunno. I want to read this on the sofa, or in a chair and it just flops everywhere. A little frustrating.That's my only gripe about this book though. I won't knock it any stars for that. The information inside this is well worth the struggle to read it. If you are a comic creator, you really should not be without this book. I would say it is a must have.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Drawing Words and Writing Pictures is more of a course that a book on drawing comics. The authors Jessica Abel and Matt Madden, both comic artists and teachers, have designed the book to follow a 15-week semester. It's easy to follow and each lesson builds on the previous.The course is comprehensive and covers everything from paneling, storytelling, transitions, lettering, inking, character development, etc. Basically every form of education you need to create your own comic.Each lesson has plenty of illustrated examples from the authors and other artists like Craig Thompson, Osamu Tezuka, Paul Pope, etc. You're exposed to many styles, genre and ways of creating comics. The instructions are so clear it's almost like hand holding, but of course you still have to do all the hard work. And the lessons end with homework so you can actually practice what was taught -- practical.This is a really helpful guide on drawing comics. Highly recommended to aspiring comic artists. Well worth the price.This is as close as it can get to attending a real comics drawing class.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)",

                "reviewText": "95% of artists who completed course this would find themselves improved.The type is indeed too small and the space not always well used.The tone is friendly, personal, non-pedantic. I think the opening section, analyzing what a comic is, and comparing the different names for comics in different languages, IS interesting. More importantly, it gets you thinking--fundamentally--about what it is you're about to get into.If one struggles through that (brief!) opening part, finding it too heady, not entertaining enough, one may not have the optimal mindset for getting the value of this book. Yet still benefit from it.Drawing Words and W;riting Pictures wisely suggests specific ways of \"socializing\"your comics learning, and does all it can to compensate for the lack of an in-room teacher. Kudos! The material on Character and narrative arc are wonderful and rightly presents those two topics almost in tandem.I love that a section on inking is titled \"Softening the Black.\" That gets at the purpose of almost all the tools and techniques of inking. It's a fundamental insight that I don't think you'd find in any other such book.Abel and Madden guide you in practical matters, like setting up your inking kit and working area, doing exercises, caring for your back.The weakest part I think is the chapter on lettering. Abel and Madden come at comics from a Europhilic, Fantagraphics-y mindset that emphasizes sincerity and sweat over polish and efficiency and urge people to learn hand lettering. Fair enough. The rules of lettering are the same -- or most definitely should be -- but the book's lettering dos and don'ts are near-non existent.Incredibly, some of their illustrations feature the roundly and justly reviled font Comic Sans! Equally bizarre, to anyone with even a semi-professional background, they don't know and don't teach the rule on how to use serifed capital Is. Nothing shrieks \"amateur\" in work samples like seeing that serifed I in the middle of a word.They say you can get a font made of your hand lettering (a great idea), but don't say where.Another weakness is that--like a million how-tos before-- this book shows you 6 or 7 different mouths, for example, IN ISOLATION and moves on. Faces are way too important to be given this once-over lightly treatment. Here is where the authors should have looked to the world of animation to show how features interact and contribute to an overall attitude/expression. See the immaculate attachment from Disney's Big Hero 6. On the plus side, they do talk about how other parts of the face can affect the shapes of eyes.",
