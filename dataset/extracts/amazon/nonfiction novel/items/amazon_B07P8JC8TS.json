At eighteen, Alexandra Wickham is presented to King George V and Queen Mary in an exquisite white lace and satin dress her mother has ordered from Paris. With her delicate blond looks, she is a stunning beauty who seems destined for a privileged life. But fate, a world war, and her own quietly rebellious personality lead her down a different path. By 1939, Europe is on fire and England is at war. From her home in idyllic Hampshire, Alex makes her way to London as a volunteer in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. But she has skills that draw the attention of another branch of the service. Fluent in French and German, she would make the perfect secret agent. Within a year, Alex is shocking her family in trousers and bright red lipstick. They must never know about the work she does\u2014no one can know, not even the pilot she falls in love with. While her country and those dearest to her pay the terrible price of war, Alex learns the art of espionage, leading to life-and-death missions behind enemy lines and a long career as a spy in exotic places and historic times. Spy follows Alex\u2019s extraordinary adventures in World War II and afterward in India, Pakistan, Morocco, Hong Kong, Moscow, and Washington, D.C., when her husband, Richard, enters the foreign service and both become witnesses to a rapidly changing world from post-war to Cold War.

                "reviewText": "I fell in love with Spy even before I read the first page, what drew me in was the cover and from there it was rollercoster ride of mystery, intrigue, all wrapped in a 1940's plot of WW2, England and a young women's desire to do something other than to marry into a wealthy family. Danielle Steele did not disappoint this time, with lots of details of the beginning impact of WW2 when children were sent to the country to be safe from bombings in England, to how a spy is born. The various countries we have the opporuntunity to visit throughout the novel provides the difference in living as someone affluent in the military and those who are not as fortunate. The only downside I had with the novel was the the very end, it seemed to wrap up quite abruptly to me. I would have liked to see where Alexandra's remaining life lead her with the new man/friend in her life. As I said, though, a minor thing in my opinion. One of Danielle Stelle's best work in a long time, very reminiscent of her early works.",

With Danielle Steel's latest release SPY, she delves into the life of a family in late 1930's Hampshire as World War II is raging and their loved ones are getting into the midst of it all.Finding herself at odds with what life is expecting of her and where it's leading her, Alexandra sets out to volunteer during the war at the First Aid Nursing center, but her fluent language skills quickly gain the attention of intelligence that tempts her into spying on the enemy. During this time she meets and falls in love with a pilot, but she must keep her secret assignments to herself.We continue to follow her life and assignments as the war ends and she marries her pilot and goes on to raise a family as she continues to compile secrets she can share with no one.I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a historical romance intermixed with turmoil, secrets and intrigue. Alexandra was easy to become enchanted with, and following her through all of her exploits was quite riveting.",

I first had a sample sent to my kindle to see if it was something that she would enjoy. I haven't read any Danielle Steel books for quite a while although I've never been disappointed in any of them in the past and I we are both fans of books set during WWII. So then once hooked I had to buy it for my own. I really enjoyed this book I was quickly reminded that she never had any problems with having main characters go through deaths of close friends and family members and won't say anything more as to not give any spoilers away. If you have not read any Danielle Steel lately or have followed her book after book I highly recommend this book to both types of her readers.",

I usually like Danielle Steel\u2019s books, but sometimes I feel like her stories repeat. Since she writes 7 books per year, it feels like she may be running out of original ideas or forgetting that she has used some of these plots already. Not my favorite but not the worst one she\u2019s written.",
