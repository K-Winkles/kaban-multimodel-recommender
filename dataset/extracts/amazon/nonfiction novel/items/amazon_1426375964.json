It is our go-to entertainment in the car! This book is an amazing compliment (or introduction) to the series! The illustrations are great, and the storytelling is captivating. The book includes a guide to all the characters discussed with name pronunciations, a map showing locations, and an index for quick reference. And yes, the Oracle of WiFi is included in the storytelling! This book, and the podcast (which we listen to on Amazon Music) are not just entertaining, they are educational. This is a truly enjoyable franchise for families. I highly recommend checking this out!",

I\u2019m so glad we found the podcast and I have been listening to all 9 seasons with my son in the car. The style and light approach keeps him interested.We decided to buy the book and it\u2019s the same amazing light and funny take on Greek mythology. My son even asked if he can take it to school so he can read it during quiet time.Amazing book. Thank you and keep the podcast going please!!!",
