        "description": "The narrative of Charles Darwin's historic journey that ignited the chain of ideas that eventually led to The Origin of Species Charles Darwin was twenty-two years old and embarking on the journey of a lifetime when HMS Beagle left from Devonport on December 27, 1831. His logbook, which has been condensed below, depicts a naturalist patiently noting geology, natural history, people, places, and events. These exceptional papers include information about the Australasian coral reefs, the Gossamer spider of Patagonia, and the Galapagos volcanoes. These revelations sparked the intellectual currents that eventually gave rise to the idea of evolution and the most divisive work of the Victorian era, The Origin of Species. Read more",

                "reviewText": "The reader of this edition, the great David Case, is wonderful. And of course Voyage is a great work, interesting on many levels, a glimpse of insight and genius to come.Some listeners think that a passage regarding the outrage of the ichneumon wasp paralyzing caterpillars and laying her eggs inside them is missing. It is not missing.In Voyage, near the end of Chapter 2, (it is a long passage, 4 or 5 paragraphs), Darwin does discuss this wasp, and her pursuit of a spider (totally creepy), and mentions that the wasp also paralyzes caterpillars and lays her eggs in them. But the connection between the survival strategy of the wasp to benevolent design is not discussed in Voyage in any edition, audio or paper. In Origin, Darwin writes that this phenomenon can't be consistent with benevolent design. Darwin expresses himself most clearly regarding the practices of this wasp and benevolent diety in a letter to Asa Gray written in 1860. The letter is quoted in numerous Wikipedia pieces on Darwin:\"I own that I cannot see as plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.\"",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised at how easy this is to read! I was particularly interested in Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands, having just returned from a trip to that area. Also, I am reading another book about the area, \"The Uttermost Part of the Earth\", written by a man born there in the mid 1800s, son of a missionary. It has been interesting, reading teh books together, because both authors share many experiences, but with often differing opinions. Darwin's descriptions of the geography and the wildlife are wonderful. My one complaint (and it's a big one) is that this is supposed to be the \"Illustrated Edition\" and there is not one illustration in the e-book. Still, I have really enjoyed the book, and encourage others to try it.",

Well worth the time to read slowly. I liked it a bit at a time.Mel Cearley",

He spent time with all sorts: settlers, gauchos, missionaries, leaders, sailors, native people, slaves ( horrified by their treatment).",

Also, I especially enjoyed the book because many years ago I acquired a very nice original oil painting of the Beagle plying its way through the Straight of Magellan, a work which has given me much pleasure over the years.",

                "reviewText": "If you've read the \"Origin of Species\"; but haven't yet read the \"Voyage of the Beagle (1845)\", then this is certainly a MUST read. It is an abridged version of the 1845 original; but full of beautiful pictures (Hardcover edn.) and notes from Captain Robert FitzRoy from the 2nd voyage of HMS Beagle! Nice way to publish a classic. Kids too will love it. This was the inspirational journey of Charles Darwin (prior to his publication of the Origin of Species)",
