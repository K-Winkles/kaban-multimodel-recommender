There's nothing earth-shattering here. There are gems scattered throughout, though. The bits most valuable to me come near the beginning and near the end, where Mosely lays out his writing process, explicitly. For whatever reason, this one worked for me. It helped me see a way forward, and now I am actually doing it. If you want to write fiction but feel that something is standing in your way, I strongly recommend this book. It's only about a hundred quick pages anyway -- what do you have to lose?",

                "reviewText": "I was conducting research in a small library recently when I stumbled upon this book on the craft of writing. Over the years, I've read numerous books on novel writing and eventually published three mysteries, utilizing the techniques I gleaned from these books. But finding a craft book by another mystery writer was a real treat. I sat down and read it and then later purchased a copy for my home library.This book lays it out for the novice, or professional who is just looking for a little refresher training or motivation, and succinctly delivers the core of how to complete a novel in a year. This is on my top 5 list for delivering the best advice you can get from a real champion. Without exception, I would highly recommend this book. And, if you're interested in screenwriting, you may also benefit from Bill Johnson's non-fiction craft book, \"A Story is a Promise\", which delves into the craft as well as the emotional connection that we expect stories to fulfill that Mr. Mosley also touches on. Mr Mosley provides an easy no nonsense approach at how a book gets written, and how anyone with a strong desire can accomplish the task.Doc Macomber, Author -- \"The Killer Coin\", \"Wolf's Remedy\", \"Snip\"",

I had hoped for a more process-driven book.Nevertheless, the book was full of invaluable advice, like don't let research be a reason to procrastinate the writing process. This one stuck with me since I can \"research\" till the cow comes home. The pursuit of perfection can be a hindrance in a novel writer's process.",

That said, there is much to like about this slim volume.Not many writers of Mosley\u2019s caliber would bother to write a guide for the beginning writer. It\u2019s to Mosley\u2019s credit that he did so\u2014and did so well.Mosley has written another book\u2014Elements of Fiction\u2014which I have not read but which I assume is a companion volume to this one.",

In fact, it's the smallest \"How-to\" book on novel writing I have (& I have 22+ of them); and probably the smallest out there (102 pages) in print. The authors wordsmithing is straight and simple. No dithering. No fluff. From the intro passages onward, you can't shake the feeling of an unseen finger, pointing a \"It's you I'm speaking to\" air coming out of the book. It's a fast read, yet, there's no sense of hurry about it; taking its time to hit all the basic high notes: from an admonition + encouragement, to needed tools (both physical and mental), to the elements of fiction, to the how-to opening of the very 1st sentence. Not to forget that he gives easy to follow examples as you read along. All packed in just 102 pages.I wrap this one up by quipping that you'll end this book not wanting it to end. And after you've put it down, its words will linger, hanging over your heart, making you NOT to think that your going to write your novel this year, but KNOW that you are.",

This book prepares you for the mindset you will need and helps steer you into the starting blocks with confidence and enthusiasm. Mosley is a great writer. His guidance is simple and well illustrated. This isn't a step by step writing by numbers kind of book though. The author knows too well that 'good' literature is not made that way.",
