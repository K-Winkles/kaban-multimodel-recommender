Having read Dickens in print, on a Palm device, and now in graphic novel form, it is definitely a great option for introducing young readers to a great but perhaps complicated story. The volume is nicely fleshed out with a quick cheat sheet of characters at the start, a quick biography of Dickens, and a discussion of the death penalty, and transportation, and criminal justice in England in the late 1800s in England. There is also a nice introduction to how graphic novels are created.",

Having read them they can recount characters, story and plot, even from the original text versions. The children love the graphics, which make complex English accessible and bring the stories to life. Where a Classical Comics title is not available disappointment is tangible. As new titles come into production I am buying them in advance for future birthdays and Christmas gifts. Truly superb. Thank you.",
