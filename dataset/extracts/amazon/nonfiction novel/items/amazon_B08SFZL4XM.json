This book covers alot of differnt things, but it gives you just enough to get you intrigued and makes u want to go search more out about each topic doscussed...it issecret teachings of all ages so it only has a few good pages on each... but it expresses info well and gives you references to where they got the information , like book title author or museum.. this book has given me chill bumps a few times. And reminds me of why I like the occult and that's bc it let's you know there's more to the world than brim stone and fire and there is magic in the world. Alot of the teaching and info in this book came from other books that ate no longer published, and are worth alot of money to aquire so it's all in all a cool book to have...there's so much we don't know\ud83e\udd14",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive And Informative",
                "reviewText": "This gigantic book is very informative. It touches on the origins of many philosophical subjects.The word 'secret' in the title is significant. The main theme I think is that going back to the beginning of the human race there have been advanced souls who are initiated into ancient mysteries. After being sworn to secrecy they are sent out with that arcane knowledge to serve and enlighten mankind. Often they are misunderstood and persecuted.For example Pythagorus and later Plato were supposedly initiated into the Egyptian mysteries during rites that were (and perhaps still are) performed in a secret complex underneath the Great Pyramid. The Edgar Cayce material indicates that Christ was also initiated into the Egyptian mysteries and it was Christ who broke the sarcophogus inside the pyramid to symbolize His victory over death.There's a lot of very mysterious and mystical information in this book. It suggests that people like the enigmatic Francis Bacon had strange powers and possibly lived for over 300 years, faking his own funeral in the process.Interesting for me was the idea that it was sorcery and the perversion of the mysteries that led to the destruction of Atlantis and ancient Egypt.I took off one star because I feel it is perhaps too philosophical. Hall saw philosophy and symbolism in everything, suggesting that the stories in the New Testament in the bible are allegories for philosophical ideas. If amazon had a 10 star rating I would have given it 9 stars.Hall believed that philosophy is the only hope for this profane and God forsaken world. The highlight of his short career on Wall Street was witnessing someone take their own life after losing money in the stock market. He had become disillusioned by World War 1 and the materialism that he perceived in the world.This is not a book for skeptics or atheists. Hall believed that the spiritual realm is the true reality.The text size that accompanies the illustrations is smaller than the other text. You have to read those descriptions in good lighting. The illustrations are good though and very informative.
