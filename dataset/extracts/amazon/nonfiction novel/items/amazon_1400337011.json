The research done for this project is impressive and extremely well sited and sourced.The beginning was slow giving maybe a tiny bit too much \"background info\" but that could be just me because I am very familiar with the subject matter.If you are interested in WWII history or just Pearl Harbor this is for you. I had just recently been to Pearl Harbor and recognized many of the places talked about in this book. The USS Arizona Memorial is a must see- side note.Care was taken when writing anything that wasn't well documented and the writing is honest about those things. The footnotes were great and the way it was split up made it a quick and easy read. Next time I am in Hawaii I am going to go visit the places talked about in this book. It will be so amazing to stand in the footprints of historical giants.",

Why I moved it up to 4 is basically the writing righted itself as the book went on. It is a book well worth the read, and as far as the authors go they will progress as was apparent in this book.",

                "reviewText": "... finished it in one night. Now I get a turn. He's a WWII history buff, he's from Oahu, third generation Japanese American, and his Dad, who was hoping to go to France with his cousins was drafted into the Military Intelligence Service (MIS). He tried to tell them he didn't really know Japanese but they looked at his school records and said, \"good try\". When the Japanese military bombed Pearl Harbor he was on his way to baseball practice. So, the book resonates with my husband on many levels. I think I will enjoy it because it's largely about (I hope) what was going on for the everyday people on Oahu. Yes the heros on each side are all about the military but since they were both living on Oahu I'm hoping to get a feel of what it was like. You may take exception to my calling the Japanese spy hidden in an embassy job a hero, but that's a matter of perspective. He did a dangerous job for his country. To me that makes him a hero.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this book once I realized that it wasn't supposed to be \"Combined Fleet Decoded,\" or \"At Dawn We Slept.\" It's not that kind of war history. It's more personal and gave me a glimpse into how the war changed the population, particularly a select population of Hawaii during the run up to and following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I know about the intelligence failures and the fumbles. I already know about the battles, the ships, the major players, ups, downs, signals intelligence, victories and mistakes. What I didn't know was how all this had an effect on the Japanese Population in Hawaii, and how a Japanese American would feel with one foot in his non military culture and the other as an intelligence officer for the American Navy. How some people he'd known previously respected him for his service, and others turned their backs on him because of that service. It's personal. But, he's not the only figure that changes and suffers and their stories are just as interesting. It's a thoughtful treatment and one I'm glad to have read along with all of the 4\" thick history books on my shelves.",
