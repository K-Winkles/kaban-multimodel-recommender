                "reviewText": "This book offers an unique perspective on what has unfortunately become a familiar story: too many people, from different countries, with varying levels of skill and experience, attempt to climb a famous but very dangerous mountain (in this case K2) at the same time by the same upper route to the summit. In 2008, nearly 40 climbers made this choice to take advantage of a narrow window of good weather. 11 died during a 24 hour period, and many others barely escaped with their lives. The well-written narrative is hard to put down, as the climbers try to make decisions and work together in this extreme high altitude environment. What makes this book different is that the authors focus most of this book on two of the climbers, Nepalis from the Sherpa people, giving their life stories in detail. Driven by a desire to escape poverty, achieve status, and support their families, they first serve as porters for climbing expeditions, then become skilled, accomplished climbers themselves. The authors provide interesting information about the Sherpa people, and their involvement in mountaineering. The reader also learns about the complex, unstable political situation in Nepal during their Civil War, which drove many rural families to the cities (primarily Kathmandu). While reading this, I thought about the great changes Western climbers have brought to the Sherpa people, both good and bad. 94 Sherpas have died on Mt Everest alone. More and more non-Nepali climbers will seek the summits of the world's highest mountains. Many of these people will depend on Sherpas to make their dreams a reality.",

So, the beginning of the book immediately tapped into my desire to know \u2018What happened?\u201d And \u201cWho made it through and what was it like for them?\u201d This book intertwines Nepali history and culture with the story of the 2008 K2 disaster.Reading this gave me a similar, immersive experience that I also received when reading \u2018Into Thin Air,\u2019 that made me feel like I was up there, helplessly watching this unfold.The authors really captured a rich, but brief lesson history of Nepal and the practices/beliefs of the Sherpas. This was one of the strongest aspects that made this book stand out from most other mountaineering books - our perspectives is not of a western eye.Buried in the Sky also did a wonderful job at capturing the personality of the Savage Mountain. Although not quite as tall as Everest, you quickly learn how nature behaves on this mountain, and why mere height is far from the only factor that makes K2 the danger that it is.The only thing that I may find to be a con to this book was it's length - it's much shorter than I expected it would be.",

Lots of excess information that could have been left out to focus on the actual 2 main surviving Sherpas and their trek as opposed to historical long winded stories that were really not needed to flesh out this story.

                "reviewText": "I found this account of the tragic ascent of K2 in 2008 in which 11 climbers and porters lost their lives deeply moving. Set against the sheer stupidity and mercenary motives which led far too many teams to attempt to scale the mountain's deadly Bottleneck, so narrow it could only be traversed in single file, in a tight weather window of two or three days, it is the heroism of a few that stays with me. Some of the actions of Sherpas and other porters plus the odd Western climber were extraordinarily brave- these men must have known their chances of survival were minimal. I found the first few chapters a bit slow going but as the story progressed I appreciated the background knowledge they provided on individuals and the pressures they faced in various ways. As the tragedy unfolded I found the descriptions of what they endured and the decisions they made at critical times deeply affecting. A great testament to true mountaineers.",
