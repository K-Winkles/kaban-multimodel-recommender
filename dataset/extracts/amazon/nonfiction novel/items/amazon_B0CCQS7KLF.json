Gr 6 Up\u2013Middle school students Padmini, Sammy, Joe, and Tiana visit the local history museum for their group project on AANHPI (Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders). Accompanied by Kenji, a tour guide at the museum, they embark on an incredible journey through time where they discover key events in AANHPI history. Kenji starts the history journey with the arrival of the \u201cManilamen\u201d (Filipino immigrants) in the 18th century, followed by various momentous events spanning the next 150 years in the United States.

Recommended purchase.\"\"Historic contributions and stories of resilience are shared in this dynamic graphic novel. An informative and engaging read!\"\u2014Maia and Alex Shibutani, two-time Olympic medalists and authors of Amazing: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Who Inspire Us AllAsian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander history is American history. The unique experiences, challenges, and contributions of AANHPIs are an integral part of our country\u2019s development, but they are rarely taught in American schools.For many Americans of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander descent who grew up in the United States, there continues to be a startling lack of opportunity to learn about our own history in our country. Even today, over 70% of Americans have little knowledge about AANHPI history or confuse it with Asian history. Fighting to Belong! Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders from the 1700s Through the 1800s, written by best-selling writer Amy Chu (Wonder Woman, Deadpool, Ant-Man, Iron Man) and Alexander Chang and illustrated by Louie Chin (Bodega Cat), shares this important and dynamic part of the American experience in an accessible and engaging graphic novel format.In this book, the first volume of a three-book series, our middle school protagonists Padmini, Sammy, Joe, and Tiana and their guide, Kenji, embark on an amazing journey through time to witness key events in AANHPI history. They witness the arrival of the \"Manilamen\" to the United States in the eighteenth century and fly through significant moments in the next 150 years. Fighting to Belong! helps new audiences young and old, AANHPI and non-AANHPI, understand how these stories are truly interwoven within the fabric of America.",

                "reviewText": "I was worried that this was going to be too advanced in reading and subject matter for my 8 yo, but I thought it was important for us to learn together the history of AAPIs. The framework and graphic novel format made the story very accessible. A group of middle schoolers go on a time traveling field trip of sorts for a school project. During the course of Volume 1, they realize what they're learning is more important than a school project and struggle with their emotions when learning about past wrongs aimed at AAPIs.The book talks about groups of AAPIs who died of disease brought by Europeans or killed due to fighting for their rights or because they were AAPIs. I know some parents aren't ready to talk about those topics with their kids, but we've talked about war and the civil rights movement in the United States particularly about the discrimination the Black community has faced. It felt right to introduce the history of AAPI discrimination and civil rights in parallel.We read through the book at bedtime over two nights. I was wondering if she would want to pick the book up again after the first night, and she enthusiastically requested that we finish it. I stopped at certain parts to explain that we had family members who worked on the railroad and faced discrimination that led them to go back to China. We also talked through some parallels with what she already learned in school, such as Native Hawaiians dying from diseases introduced by Europeans similar to the Native Americans on the U.S. mainland.I also appreciate that the authors included that the US government has apologized for their role in overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy. We were able to talk through how government sometimes makes big mistakes and what our role is in our democracy.My daughter really enjoyed the book and has asked to bring it in the car with her so she can read parts on her own. I'm sure she'll have some more tough questions for us about the subject matter, but we expected that. This book is a great conversation starter if you want to start these conversations with your kids (or educate yourself for future conversations).My daughter and I are excited to read Volume 2 when it comes out.",

This book covered a lot of ground and opened up a lot of discussions between myself and my 6yo and 8 yo. Definitely a little advanced for the 6yo, but my 8yo actually found the book first and was eager to flip through and take a read before we read it together. In a world of Dog Man and Diary of a Wimpy Kid, this was such a refreshing way to engage and talk about our history.",

The tour is led by a special tour guide who takes them on a time-traveling adventure through American history where the students witness the injustices faced by many Asian American and Pacific Islanders in America\u2019s past, like those faced during the California Gold Rush and overthrowing of the Hawaiian monarchy. As they prepare for the 20th century part of the tour, the museum director halts the tour and promptly fires the tour guide, leaving the reader with a cliffhanger for the next book in this trilogy.As Kenji, the tour guide, said \u201c History is about truth. You can\u2019t pick and choose only the nice parts.\u201d This is exactly what the authors of Fighting to Belong have done\u2013provide a visual exploration of the truths about Asian American and Pacific Islanders\u2019 struggles in America. Readers will get an honest dose of history that provides more detail than any middle school history book. Students are shown how the treatment of Asian Americans during the Gold Rush and building of railroads resulted in many deaths, including how racism caused hate-filled mobs, broke apart families, and denied equal access to education to all students. The beauty of this book is how it tells these stories in a graphic novel, a medium that reaches students who otherwise might not pick up a novel or history book. The graphics are well done and the story is written well for all readers. This books is a great addition to any library!",

The writers and artist make a complex history of Asians easily digestible for all ages. I thought I knew everything about Asian history. Surprised that there's so much more to learn. Looking forward to the next volume. Will definitely pick up a copy of Bodega Cat next.",
