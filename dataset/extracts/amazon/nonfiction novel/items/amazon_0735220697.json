At first I was afraid this was going to be a predictable chick lit/romance. But no, a much deeper, complicated story, and Eleanor is one of the most courageous, complicated, and lovable heroines I've come to know since Kya from Where the Crawdads Sing. When I think of Eleanor, the phrase \"odd duck\" comes to mind, which is not a bad thing. I am just so glad she came to embrace that part of herself, and all her other lovable, quirky traits. This story made me laugh out loud and shed tears too. That is a rare, but wonderful thing.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s hard for me to figure out how to rate this book, probably because it\u2019s so far from my typical choice of reading material.I can\u2019t recall why I picked it up, but the narrative voice was what hooked me. Eleanor almost comes off like she has Asberger\u2019s or something\u2013she\u2019s extremely articulate, and seems to have next to no concept of what\u2019s expected of her socially. She\u2019s also an unreliable narrator, judging others for having no social graces when in fact, she\u2019s the one who erred. This was amusing, and I mostly just read to see what she\u2019d say or do next, in a series of episodic events in her life tending (so it seemed) more or less toward nothing. For the first half of the book or so, she fixates upon a local front man from a band, deciding he\u2019s the one, even though they\u2019ve never met, and she objectively realizes that she\u2019s not very attractive (having a burn on half of her face, though we won\u2019t find out why for some time), while he\u2019s gorgeous. She is undeterred, and goes about on a self-improvement scheme to make herself his equal to the best of her ability. Meanwhile, every Wednesday night she has a phone call with her Mummy, who is \u2013somewhere, we\u2019re not told where, but we\u2019re led to believe it\u2019s an institution of some kind. Mummy is very angry, and every phone call leaves Eleanor feeling awful and needing, so she believes, massive amounts of vodka, which she consumes every weekend, all weekend long.Then, unusual things begin to happen. Eleanor finds herself befriended by Raymond, the IT specialist at her workplace, almost against her will. She and Raymond encounter an elderly man who collapses in the street, and they save his life, thus bringing him and his family into their circle as well.As Eleanor\u2019s fantasy toward the singer progresses, though, eventually she\u2019s forced to confront reality. Spoiler alert: there\u2019s a really disturbing attempted suicide scene, but it precipitates the second half of the book, where Eleanor learns what really happened in her past to give her the scar, and why her Mummy is the way she is. I saw most of this coming, but there\u2019s a surprise twist about Mummy at the very end that helped explain the inconsistencies in her character that had previously really bothered me.The subject matter is dark, but it\u2019s handled in a hopeful way.My rating: ***1/2Language: it\u2019s there, though not overwhelmingSexual content: it\u2019s there but mildViolence: it\u2019s there but not gratuitousPolitical content: none that I can recall",

                "reviewText": "This book was fantastic. I had read a lot of noise about it for a while due to all the awards it had won and it did not disappoint. I couldn't put it down. The narrative that runs through is wrote from Eleanor Oliphants point of view and at times you squirm at the way she sees the world but as the story emerges you realise just why she is the way she is. I think that's also what made me love it so much as well, as her character totally emerges throughout to get to the end where you feel proud that she's reached the place she reached and thats all you could want for her. Total must read 5 stars and you will not want to put it down once you start. Glad I chose this as my last book of 2023.",

                "reviewText": "Ein geregelter Job seit neun Jahren, eine eigene Wohnung, jeden Tag etwas zu essen, ein Fernseher und ein Leben ohne H\u00f6hen und Tiefen- was mehr k\u00f6nnte sich die drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrige Eleanor Oliphant denn vom Leben w\u00fcnschen?! So sieht sie das jedenfalls selbst zu Beginn eines Romans, den ich auf einer vierst\u00fcndigen Zugfahrt verschlungen habe. Und doch zeigt sich nach und nach, dass so ziemlich alles fehlt oder zutiefst dysfunktional ist, was ein Leben lebenswert macht: Freunde, eine Beziehung, eine Familie.Die Rahmenhandlung ist schnell erz\u00e4hlt: eine Frau, die in einem B\u00fcro arbeitet, ist einigerma\u00dfen einsam und ungl\u00fccklich. Im Laufe des Romans verbessert sich ihre Situation. Aber halt. Das ist es nat\u00fcrlich nicht, warum mich das Buch Hitze und Chaos einer vierst\u00fcndigen Bahnfahrt hat vergessen lassen. Eleanor ist mit all ihren besonderen Verhaltensweisen schr\u00e4g und knurrig wie Ove in \"Ein Mann namens Ove\". Und genauso wie in diesem Roman auch, zeigt sich langsam, was dazu gef\u00fchrt hat, dass sie ist, wer sie ist. Das habe ich gespannt verfolgt und dabei immer mehr ihre geradlinige, unangepasste Art zu sch\u00e4tzen gelernt.Insofern bin ich den Menschen ihres Umfelds gefolgt, die ebenfalls immer mehr zu ihr durchdringen, die \u00fcber ihre Besonderheiten nicht nur hinwegsehen, sondern das Liebenswerte in Eleanor sehen und so dazu beitragen, dass sie sich den Problemen stellen kann, die ihr das Leben vor die F\u00fc\u00dfe geworfen hat.Im Anhang des Buches beschreibt die Autorin, dass sie diesen Erstling geschrieben hat, um gerade auf die Einsamkeit j\u00fcngerer Menschen aufmerksam zu machen. Gegl\u00fcckt!So zeigt sich wieder: Es ist oft nicht die spektakul\u00e4re Handlung, die mich bei der Stange h\u00e4lt, sondern es ist die Entwicklung einer Figur und die Darstellung in guter Sprache. Nach einigen B\u00fcchern der letzten Zeit, die mir entweder zu banal oder zu intellektuell abgedreht waren, war Eleanor ideal, um mal wieder ganz in ein anderes, fiktives Leben einzutauchen. Ich kann das Buch allen empfehlen, die besondere Figuren und Lebensbetrachtungen m\u00f6gen.potzblog.de",
