Vyncs 12V Power Adapter: We also offer a 12V power adapter cable for installing the Vyncs device in non-OBD-compliant light or heavy duty vehicle. Note that the 12V power adapter cable is different from the OBD-II Extension Cable shown above.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Vyncs' tracker for a little over a year now and it is WELL worth the investment. The subscription was $80 for a year so I just renewed it when I was surprised with a premium version of the plan (which includes more features) for free! As for the actual product, its really easy to install and use on the web browser and app- I never had to call in for additional instructions, just plug, pay and play. I also really appreciate that the company won't send me weekly ads via email, I just bought the subscription and that was it. I only found out that it was time for renewal once I logged into the app to check some diagnostics on my car and then I had the notification in-app. Overall it's a great product that works fast to provide details about car diagnostics (which has helped me fix problems in the car without a mechanic and saved literally hundreds of dollars) and track the car's position while being installed in a discrete spot. This has come in handy sometimes when I forget where I parked, but I really got that just in case my car ever gets stolen.Overall, after one year with Vyncs I have been very pleased with the product and the ease of use.",

                "reviewText": "This device is the very best decision I have ever made.I am a single parent with a licenced teenage driver with a job. This is our third device and I have been using Vyncs for 6 years. The devices are in older model cars and work fabulously.Our older model cars are not equipped with any kind of anti-theft device, GPS, or location services.A friend recommended Vyncs. I researched it and decided it was a good fit for my family circumstance. I had the devices installed at my local auto repair shop and it has proven itself useful nearly everyday. I now know where the cars are at any given time of the day. The app shows a detailed description of the route the car took, the speed, the driving behavior of the operator, the mechanical functioning of the vehicle, and it sends notifications if something is not as it should. For example, I got a notification there was a mechanical malfunction with the car. Two minutes later I received a call my young driver from the side of the road. They told me the check engine light was on. As it turned out, the engine oil was low. Vyncs saved the engine!It's great for people who travel a long distance for work or school. While coming home during the recent snow storm, it took my driver twice the amount of time it usually does. I checked the app and could their travel progress. I could see where the car was on the highway, how fast it was driving, the driving behavior for that trip, the mechanical status of the car and all in real time.On a different occasion the Vyncs device notified me of an impact. Again two minutes later I recieved a call to report a fender bender in a parking lot and all was ok.I was able to see where the impact occured and the plot points where the cars impacted and where the car had moved off the road.The vehicles were registered and insured in my name. I get an insurance discount for having it.It's also a great deterant to foolishness. My driver is aware the device is in the car and this information discourages friends from using the car to skip school, or joy riding. \"I can't take the car there. My mom will know where we are.\" It gives a kid another option to use as a way out of doing something they don't want to do. It keeps them honest. It keeps me informed, and everyone safe.The car was stolen twice since having the device in the car.. The police were able to retrieve the car quickly based on the accuracy of the GPS. The device also documents vehicle speed, driving behavior (harsh turning, excessive breaking, G force limits, abrupt stopping, excessive idle time 40 minutes, etc) This information was valuable to the police and helped retrieve the car more quickly.I would recommend this device for any parent who is truely motivated to keep a young driver in the correct lane. It does wonders for a parents state of mind. My insurance premiums were also lowered due to the accuracy, functionality, and quality of the device.The benefits of having a device in your car outweigh the price of the device by a million times.I highly recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "This device is ok if you want to monitor your vehicle's location (as long as it's NOT a 2020 Honda). My son likes it because we live in a high-theft area and if it disappears, we can track it. Not so good for monitoring battery and engine issues (more below).UPDATE #1: It's been over a year now, and the device has not only delivered great results, but it has delivered piece of mind. My son's 1997 Tahoe had an issue with the 02 oxygen sensors and the device notified us of early detection. While not a serious issue, fuel consumption can be troublesome with a truck, especially when it's not functioning properly. Vyncs saved us some $! In addition, the GPS tracker and the trip features are worth every penny. I just hope we never have to use it to track the truck if it's stolen.UPDATE#2: This device was moved from a 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe to a 2020 Honda Civic Sedan. It is NOT compatible with the Honda (regarding MPG data) and here's the response I received directly from VYNCS:Most manufacturers have about 3 generic parameters that give fuel level. These are generic parameters but not mandatory and available only for the light-duty vehicles. Because it is not mandatory, some manufacturers will not provide the parameters and if they do not, the fuel level page will be blank. Every Honda Civic since MY 2011 have not provided sufficient parameters through the OBDII system. Until Honda changes their OBDII protocol for a future generation this information will not be available in any 2011+ Honda vehicles.UPDATE #3: STEER CLEAR OF THIS DEVICE UNLESS YOU LIKE CRAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE.On Feb. 22, 2022, the GPS failed to function. I wrote customer service through the ONLY outlet they have on the website and notified them of such. I was told that the device had expired and that I was not only required to buy a NEW 4G device, but that I also had to pay another activation fee!!!!First off, you can't speak with ANYONE at this company. EVER. Email is not answered. You can only go through their tech support link and the responses are sketchy at best. Aside from the wordy explanation they gave me (above) for the fact that a 2020 Honda Accord isn't compatible, they've NEVER answered my queries in detail -- it's as though you're dealing with the Chinese all over again. A detailed description, such as what I'm writing now, deserves a detailed response. NOT POSSIBLE with Vyncs. You can ask a specific question and they send back some \"form letter\" response that may or may not have anything to do with the issue you are concerned with. I am VERY disappointed with this company.Things started out okay with the device working in a 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe, but when it was moved to a 2020 Honda Accord, EVERYTHING except the GPS function went south. It even gave false battery charge level readings. When I contacted the company, they would respond sometimes within 24 hours, mostly within 48 hours and you can FORGET ABOUT RESPONSES ON WEEKENDS. Do yourself a favor (if you are an individual looking for some accurate information) and look elsewhere -- regardless of the \"no monthly fee\" claim. They don't provide a good enough service to warrant one!These people talk a good sales game, but when presented with a serious query that requires problem-solving skills, they have nothing to offer. Save your money or shop a competitor!!!!",

Tout semble donc fonctionner \u00e0 merveille et \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier \u00e0 l'usage dans le temps.Le seul b\u00e9mol, c'est que tout leur site internet et l'app sont en anglais, ce qui n'est pas un soucis pour moi mais qui peut g\u00eaner certaines personnes. Autre petite chose constat\u00e9e, le prix moyen du carburant doit \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9 en US dollar...J'ai configur\u00e9 des zones de geofencing, et pour l'instant, malgr\u00e9 le passage au travers d'elles, je n'ai pas re\u00e7u de notifications (peut-\u00eatre un d\u00e9tail de configuration qui m'a \u00e9chapp\u00e9).J'avais au d\u00e9part command\u00e9 un tracker Invoxia, qui fonctionnait tr\u00e8s mal et qui n'\u00e9tait absolument pas fiable dans les donn\u00e9es transmises.Pour l'instant, tr\u00e8s satisfait de mon nouvel achat. Si mon exp\u00e9rience devait changer, je ne manquerai pas de modifier mon commentaire.UPDATE : Le Geofencing fonctionne maintenant. Je re\u00e7ois des mails et des notifications push via l'app lorsque l'on entre ou sort des zones que j'ai d\u00e9finies. --> +1 \u00e9toile",
