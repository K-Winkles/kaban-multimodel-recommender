                "reviewText": "When I opened up the box it came with the GPS, Power cord (which is sufficiently long enough), a USB cable (which is a little too short), and a manual.As I am one of those who basically takes the manual and tosses it out the window I set it on my weighted mount, plugged it in, and it already acquired enough satellites to function.I did a basic configuration, set a location, and I was on my way. Initially it only showed the road name I was on, however, as I turned street numbers started popping up.One little neat thing I noticed I had enabled is the fact that I had enabled a \"tracking\" function so you can see where you were.Once I hit my first destination, I plugged my home address in, and then wanted to add Wal-Mart into the trip and it took a while as I do not know my way around the GUI yet.Once I figured out how to do a multistop trip, it was pretty much a done deal and landed me at Wal-Mart and then literally at my Door step.What I really like about this GPS is its overall size. It is very compact, slim, light weight, and was a breeze to put on my device pad for my dashboard. As you will see in the photos it fits nicely on a pad designed for a 7\" GPS.The biggest downfalls that this GPS has is a legacy USB connector, the GUI is clumbsy for your average user who doesn't read manuals or gets frustrated easily, unless you use the arrows on the left side of the screen or have a very steady finger you will find yourself having issues with some of the menus and manipulation of the map.Overall I really like this GPS, it serves its purpose, its easy to do basic functions, and the fact that it is a referb is even better since it wont end up as scrap.Worth the money personally!Update: While I do like the GPS, I had to do a factory reset on it to fix some of the routing issues. Unfortunately it still has routing issues as it appears to prefer major roads over anything else and requires you to manually bypass the routing by adding your own routing.",

                "reviewText": "I liked the price of refurbished units and was prepared to see some physical flaw on the unit, or a defective pixel (or three) on the screen. Nothing. This unit seems brand new and comes with free updates for life. What a deal! Don't sit on the fence over whether you should buy one or not. You will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "It works well most of the time, but some of the maps are a little outdated. I have punched in addresses and it can't find them when my cell phone can. You sometimes have to be very specific on the address to get it to pull up. I am used to typing on my cell phone with predictive typing and this does not have that. You have to type in all the letters, which can be frustrating when you are used to the other way. I also make a lot of mistakes when typing because the keys are small and my fingers are large. The suction cup pops off the window if it sits in the sun. Otherwise, I do like this little unit. it doesn't take up much room and I like not having to plug my phone into my car to get navigation.",

Easy to use. It's quick and for the size of the Garmin it doesn't interfere with your viewing of driving",
