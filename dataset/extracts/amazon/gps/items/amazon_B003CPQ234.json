That part is not round but the clamp was holding pretty good. I added a piece of rubber so the clamp grabs even better.The ball and garmin drivesmart 65 holder that comes with this mount was holding the gps better than the original garmin mount. It was a slightly tighter fit which is great. I also have some smaller tank bag which was pushing the gps/twisting it a bit but that was only when I was manuevring the bike (bike off) and parking it. During the ride everything was perfect. Combined with a separate usb cable I had a really nice setup.If someone wants even stronger connection there's always an option of glueing the ball.Suggestion for the seller/manufacturer:Add some kind of screw that can secure the ball part even better and make it easy to unscrew when needed. Other than that, love it!",
