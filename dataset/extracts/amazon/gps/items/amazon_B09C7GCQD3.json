                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great tracker for the money",
                "reviewText": "This GPS tracker seemed like a great product at the price it's selling for, and I have to say I am very satisfied with it. I had some concerns when I first ordered it that it might stick out a little too far when it's plugged into the OBD-II port, because I have an OBD-II Bluetooth scanner that will get in the way when it's plugged in. After unboxing it and plugging it in though, it is shorter than the OBD-II scanner and has not caused me any issues at all. The LED status lights on it are a little on the bright side, so when I'm driving at night I can see them flashing near my feet, but not so much to be a distraction. There are OBD-II extension cables available that would allow the tracker to be moved to somewhere under the dash if necessary. Some vehicles have a door or hatch that covers the OBD-II port, and it would be inconvenient to keep that door open all the time to accommodate this tracker. If a cable can be found that's slim enough, maybe it would allow for the OBD-II door to stay closed while it's in use.The tracker powered on and was activated very quickly and easily, and I was able to begin configuring settings in the Amcrest GPS Fleet app right away. There are a very large number of options beyond the simple tracking, including zones, zone groups, reports, and alerts. It took some tinkering to figure out the flow of setting up a zone for alerts, but once I figured out all the pieces it was much easier to set it all up. The alerts for entering/exiting a zone are sent out very quickly via email, SMS, or push notification through the app, or any combination of these. There is also a secondary contact for notifications to send them to another phone number or email address. I can see this being very useful for a business or fleet manager in order to send alerts to the manager of an assigned vehicle.I have not been able to receive any of the speed/engine/harsh driving type alerts with my vehicle, but it is a 2004. When I plugged into another vehicle, which is a 2017, those alerts started working. I am assuming the problem is my truck is just too old, and I will be asking Amcrest support if this is indeed the case. The tracking icon on the map shows accurate information regarding the ignition status and vehicle movement though, so it's possible that I've missed a setting somewhere. There is a manual on Amcrest's support page that mentions a procedure to synchronize the OBD-II protocol using some software provided by them, so I will be looking for that software next.There is also a web interface for tracking, which makes things easier to navigate if the app is not to your liking. That also provides a very interesting feature; the ability to share a link with another person that lets them track a device in a web browser. When the link is generated it says it's valid for three days, so after that time period a new link will have to be sent. I've looked around to see if it's possible to permanently share a device with another user, but I haven't come across any settings like that yet.The 4G reception has been excellent, though there is excellent coverage in my area. I have not been outside my area very far, so I can't say exactly how good the coverage really is anywhere else.I've been testing this out for about three weeks now, and I am extremely happy with it. I'm not running a fleet of vehicles or anything, but I could see this being very beneficial to a business to track the whereabouts of their fleet.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes the unit reports it is being \"towed\" when it is not. Other than that, we have found this to be very effective and we like it a lot. We also appreciate the low subscription cost and the ability to pay for the year or by the month. If you need exact addresses for location this is not the unit for you, but overall we would suggest this option for a small business that needs tracking and does not meet the minimum unit requirements that the larger tracking companies have.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I work with telematics for a living and this little device is great for personal use with some more tweeting it can be even better for commercial use. The web interface is very user friendly, it can display trip reports with engine on and engine off alerts. It provides a wide variety of alerts but I found the best feature if the zone setup, you can track when a vehicle reaches a location, how often it's there, etc. This is also great for tracking your elderly parents.",

                "reviewText": "I am a licesend private investigator in North Carolina of which we are legaly authorized to utilize tracking devices on our cases. I have been using tracking devices since they became available and switched to Amcrest several years aog because I was very unhappy with the service I was getting from another company. Since then, I have more than pleased with the accuracy and the mapping software that comes with the Amcrest devices. I recently purchased this particular device for my own vehicle to keep up with my mileage and location to help with the details of an investigation. The best part of the Amcrest is the customer and tech support. I have had special request and a few minor issues that were acted on immediately and never once was it handled anyway but professional and with amazing speed which this day and time is un heard of. If you are in need of a tracking device be it personal or in a professional setting....... I can highly recomend Amcrest!!J. Rorie",
