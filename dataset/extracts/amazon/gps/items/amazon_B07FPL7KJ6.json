                "reviewText": "Got this tracker for a car that I'm putting in storage so long life battery was a important consideration. Other consideration is that unlike other GPS trackers, there's no hidden contracts and you can use your own SIM card.Battery; It's been 4 days and down to 86% battery life but now I just put it in Sleep mode and will see if that extends it.Set up / features:Very easy to set up, documents are not in perfect english but easy to understand. Love the fact that there's a lot of built in features such as the shock alarm, speed control, geo fencing, sleep mode, the real time tracking and playback online (web or mobile app), I got the speedtalk sim card, which is cheap but I think I probably will end up switching to 1nce.com since that has global coverage and more than enough data / sms I need.Only con is that the device is rather large (large as 3 iphone stacked together) and not super easy to hide on a car - it will be spotted if people look hard enough. But the tradeoff is longer battery life, so you just need to decide.Update ; it's been 32 days and battery is only down to 32%. The key is to put sleep shock and speed settings. Every time you ping it with a text message it has to power up and you lose 1-2% battery. But in sleep mode, it draws very little battery.Definitely recommend if you are looking for something with long battery life. Only drawback is the size",

If you make a product that will go on an automobile or motorcycle for external use, you should make it so it can take the elements and bumps in the road , so it doesn\u2019t fall off and is a complete waste of money. Please update and make magnet stronger.",

I cannot get the tracker to talk to the app or to the website for tracking. I have tried to set the APN (access point name) multiple times with not luck. I am using a speedtalkmobile 2/3/4G LTE sim card as recommended. The directions provided in the box are terrible. Been using the WWW and YouTube to try to figure this out. If I finally figure this thing out I will update. If not its going back!Update: Tracker is getting returned as there are no 2G/3G service providers. TKSTAR recommended getting a Speedtalkmobile sim card. Well Speed talk uses T-mobile and T- mobile no longer supports 2/3G devices. Going to look for a 4g/LTE tracker.",
