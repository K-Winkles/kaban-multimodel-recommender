While you're driving?So I got the Garmin with traffic.This extended stand allowed me to place the GPS within my arm length and right below the line of sight through the windshield.Straight forward install, although without the little support foot the unit would wobble quite a bit.The little foot confounded me a but,expecting a sticking attachment. I found that the tricky was to install the bar without the support, bend it so there is some tension to the target area where the support foot would be, then slide the foot in place.No more wobbling! YAY.I guess we'll find out if the main suction cup will hold during the summer. But as it is it is holding tight.",

I have one for my F-150 and one for my Nissan Murano, both of which have deep dashboards. I no longer have to stretch while entering addresses in from the built in keyboard display, and the Garmin stays in place while I do so since the arm is stiff enough to not move in the process. Very useful addition.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product along with the woleyi dual Ipad/cell phone mount back on May 6, 2023.I am pleased mostly with the window suction, which has never faltered in the 2 months since I purchased it.the arm constuction and positionality are great. However the mounting ball at the end of the arm where the GPS mounts to it is a very loose grip. the GPS will reposition at the slightest bump in the road. though the suction mount to the window and the arm are very secure, the whole thing is unsless because the GPS will not hold position. the only way I have managed to continue to use this mount is by placing the arm low on the window and utilizing the arm support that comes with the product. In this way I can position the arm just off the dashboard and rest the bottom of my GPS on the dash. This gets me by, however using the mount higher on the window will not allow my GPS to hold position. Maybe a bit more development is needed for this product, or just a positioning ball that fits would work best.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far the sturdiest and most rigid gooseneck mount I've ever come across and the added support piece is a great idea. However... the standard Garmin mount takes a 17mm ball and this has a 17.2mm ball.With all my strength I could not get it to fit as the opening of the socket is only 15.3mm that expands to accept the 17mm ball. Such a shame, I liked everything else about this product.I did find another straight neck mount that I was able to get to fit with a little \"Impact Persuasion\", but the neck on the APPS2 car mount was too long and flexible for me to get it in. If you have the strength, it will probably work fine. Like I said it seems like a superior mount. hope this helps.",
