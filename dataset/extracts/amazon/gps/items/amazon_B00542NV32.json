                "reviewText": "Desperate for an inexpensive GPS unit, I bought this late in 2014. At first, its logic took some getting used to, for the track record is always on, and you have to clear the active track to start a new one. Not a big deal, because of course you can save the track before deleting it. Also, the \"back\" button seems to be the simplest way to move through menus. This unit replaced a series of an older inexpensive Garmin model, which lived up to their reputation of failing every two years or so, though they were fine up to the failure point.Anyway, after almost four years of extensive use and the occasional drop, my eTrex 10 is still getting the job done really well. The display is old-style plain, not for everyone, but this translates into superb battery life. I can run it all day on a fresh pair of rechargeable AA's without any fear of data loss.The accuracy of handheld GPS units is hard to pin down--smoke and mirrors, but this one certainly does the job for road logs and hiking records. Sensitivity is excellent and it doesn't take long to find satellites.Downloading tracks is easy and dependable, something I can't say for my old Garmin Forerunner 305 wrist GPS. When connected to a USB port, the eTrex 10's track and waypoint data appear in a virtual drive folder, for easy copy or upload to GPS software.All I want from a GPS device is reliable information on where I am and where I've been, for I depend on mapping software to deliver actual graphics. Users who want better mapping support from the unit itself would find the eTrex graphics too limited. Also, I don't go after geocaches and can't evaluate the unit for that. But the eTrex 10 is just fine for locating myself in trackless woods, for providing a work record of where I've been, and for keeping track of my auto travel details.I did have one tense moment when, for failture of housekeeping, the track memory became so full that there didn't seem to be enough left to run the track deletion sequence. Can't remember how I got around that; maybe by starting with the smallest tracks. Didn't want to do a complete reset because there was some information I had not downloaded.",

                "reviewText": "This GPS works very well and lasts a very long time on a single pair of alkaline AA batteries. My primary purpose is geotagging photographs, but it's handy to get around and measure distances, as well. With GLONASS and WAAS activated, this receiver locks on incredibly quickly, even if it hasn't been turned on in a couple weeks, and it's very accurate (down to 8 feet in open areas). The screen is monochrome and is highly readable in direct sunlight, which is a huge bonus over color models. A carabiner clip is sold separately, but you could fasten a zip tie to one as well.For the geography buffs, you can also change the map datum to whatever format you need, including the standard WGS84, NAD83, and GRS80, as well as change the coordinate system to most conceivable combinations of degrees, minutes, and seconds, as well as decimals of degrees or minutes. You can also save plenty of waypoints to save your favorite locations (or find your way back to your car).The biggest caveat is the miniscule 8 megabytes of internal memory compared to other GPS receivers that sport several gigabytes of storage. However, you can download and convert OpenStreetMap portions to put your local area into the device before going on a trip to get access to street and trail maps, which are very handy when you don't want to fiddle with a paper map. (There's no topography, though.)However, as mentioned at the start, I use this device to geotag photos taken with my camera, and it generates standard GPX files, which can be saved on the device to split up your current trek as you please. As long as you keep your camera's clock in sync with the clock on this receiver (be careful if using near daylight-saving time transitions), it will work with software like GeoSetter, Lightroom, and Picasa, and it works with any digital camera that stores the date and time the photo was taken.",

                "reviewText": "This is really good for training for a long trip on a bicycle. You can get your max speed, average speed and distance over a trip without having to perform calibration like you might have to on a magnet based odometer. I'm not sure what the actually battery life is (you will need to check this yourself) but I've had it going for quite a while now and haven't had to change the batteries yet.Programming this think for navigation on a bicycle trip is a pain in the rear, but I would expect that since it doesn't come with any reasonable maps. Also, the maps can't be upgraded. If you are clever, however, you can use Google Maps to get the coordinates of waypoints for your bike route and *carefully* program it so you can tell where you are supposed to be going. It is a bit tricky but it can be done... If you aren't careful you might accidentally enter a WayPoint wrong during programming and then the device becomes pretty difficult to use. Also, the device doesn't list the names of the waypoints or even show you the direction to the next waypoint in queue. Because of this you probably don't want to ever set a waypoint at a 4 way intersection. Until you get in the middle of the intersection there will be a lot of confusion as to which way you are supposed to goto next. You have to deal with intersections by programming your waypoints to be met slightly *before* the intersection (perhaps 500 feet before), that way when you het the waypoint the device will automatically show you the direction to the next waypoint *before* you get to the intersection.If you're a *serious* cyclist and don't want to deal with the hassles of this device, you might wan to buy one of Garmins more expensive models with better maps, but if you are like me an you have only done a few long distance bike rides, you might be willing to put up with the inconveniences to save some money.Basically, I *really* like this product, but you have to be skilled to use it. And I like the long battery life.",

A good basic waypoint navigation tool that can be used all over the UK mainly for me. Used for nearly a year on and off and has not let me down yet. If you want something like Google maps... this is not for you. But for a cheaper simple Waypoint Nav device. This is it.",

                "reviewText": "El Garmin eTrex es el navegador m\u00e1s b\u00e1sico de bolsillo para senderismo y monta\u00f1ismo de la marca Garmin.Desde mi punto de vista es el \u00fanico equipo que necesito para explorar en conjunto con un mapa impreso y una brujula.Existen modelos mas avanzados de GARMIN que incorporan br\u00fajula digital, pantalla a color, mapas topogr\u00e1ficos integrados, bar\u00f3metro, sin embargo considero son mera vanidad ya que muchos de ellos no son 100% \u00fatiles en campo dado que existen limitaciones como:Pantalla a color: Consume la bater\u00eda mas r\u00e1pidamente.Br\u00fajula digital: Consume bater\u00eda mas r\u00e1pidamente, no te permite apuntar con precision a tu destino como lo har\u00edas con una buena brujula con espejo y no te permite ver a trav\u00e9s del mapa para alienar tu mapa como lo har\u00edas con la brujula de placa.Bar\u00f3metro: Consume bater\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente, muy dif\u00edcilmente vas a saber tu altitud mediante el bar\u00f3metro si no lo calibras en base a una altitud de referencia conocida que obviamente te lo dar\u00e1 un mapa impreso, para predecir el clima tendr\u00edas que estar cuidando el gps cuando de se\u00f1ales de cambio de presi\u00f3n para poder ver si hay mal tiempo pr\u00f3ximo, lo cual implica encender el equipo y gastar mas bateria.Mapas topogr\u00e1ficos: No es lo mismo ver un mapa en grande donde puedes ver en una sola hoja varias referencias como las monta\u00f1as, en el gps sera muy dif\u00edcil ver el TODO en una pantalla tan peque\u00f1a, no podr\u00e1s trazar tu ruta sobre los mapas digitales tan f\u00e1cilmente a menos que sea touch.En resumen: Es el equipo ideal que tendr\u00edas que tener para uso en emergencias o cuando necesites confirmar tu ubicaci\u00f3n, y por tanto no sustituye al uso de brujula y mapa, si no todo lo contrario, los complementan. En amazon puedes encontrarte unas buenas br\u00fajulas Suunto y Brunton a buen precio, te recomiendo uses brujula con espejo y los mapas son gratuitos en el portal del INEGI del gobierno.Su precisi\u00f3n es muy buena en comparaci\u00f3n a la de un GPS de un iPhone, este \u00faltimo batalla mucho cuando recorres bosques densos, cosa que con el garmin no se aprecia tanto.La capacidad de ubicar (HotFix) r\u00e1pidamente tu ubicaci\u00f3n es agradecida cuando recorres ca\u00f1ones, barrancas o bosques densos, ya que permite mantenerte en el rumbo preciso.Puedes conectarlo a plataforma de gesti\u00f3n de datos propia de GARMIN mediante cable USB o hacer uso de plataformas como Wikiloc para poder bajar y subir rutas a tu GPS (Ojo con aquellas tomadas con tel\u00e9fonos).",
