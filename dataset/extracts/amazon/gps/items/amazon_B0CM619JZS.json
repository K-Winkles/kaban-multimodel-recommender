                "reviewText": "My husband is constantly losing his wallet in the house. It\u2019s an almost daily occurrence where we are all running around looking for it. Doesn\u2019t matter if I have a special tray sat out for his wallet and keys, or if he has a bag he takes everywhere\u2026 it still gets misplaced. I got this Key Finder, Bluetooth GPS Item tracker to place in his wallet. Not only does it give us piece of mind that we can look on the app and immediately see that it is at home, it will play a loud sound when triggered so it\u2019s easier to find it. I was amazed how fast it was to install. No app or anything needed. Just go to your Find My app and add it. That\u2019s all. Tracker doesn\u2019t need to be charged or anything. They couldn\u2019t make it any easier! I can\u2019t wait for the day that the gps locater will be able to pin point where items are in our house, or at least narrow it down to room. But it won\u2019t be long until that technology is available to us all. I would definitely get this again. I don\u2019t know what the expensive name brand ones could do that this doesn\u2019t. But it is pretty basic. GPS isn\u2019t really needed for what I am using it for. Just the sound is great!",

                "reviewText": "The fob works well with Find My and sets up easily. While it is larger than the AirTag, it is also supposedly waterproof and comes with a keychain holder as a bonus.I much prefer this style, with no buttons, to the other third-party tags that can be turned off by some magic incantation of button presses. A locator isn't much good if you accidentally turn it off.In general, this is a pretty good fob with loud-enough siren.Note that as with all third-party Find My fobs, these do not support UWB and thus can not tell you how many feet away and in which direction you need to go. You will need to rely on the chirps to find what pocket it is in or what it may be under.",

                "reviewText": "No complaints about set upon iPhone. Went quickly per instructions, renamed it to something meaningful to me. A bit of a game getting it back into silicone protector, but got it done. Checked it for distance, and guessing about 40 feet, which is good. Plus integrates into Apple's \"Find My\" network if out of Bluetooth range.However, changing the battery isn't easy. Not that I had to already, just know you will need to at some point. To do that, the instructions say you can just squeeze and twist it open, or use a tool they include. I gave that a try by hand, and eventually got it open. I then tried this tool, which is these two plastic cups you use to sandwich the sender then press and twist, and it was much easier.But I can't imagine having to keep up with these every time I need a new battery. Its something you could easily loose. And for some, I think trying to open it without the tool won't be easy. Why the didn't just go with the typical twist-off round surface cover you can use a key or coin to open, I don't know.But I think that is not a good design. Unless you stick with this brand for several of these, I expect you wonder where you put that tool when the battery dies. It also only comes with only the one rubbery white key fob you see. No stick on/clip-in mounts. For some uses, like laptops and luggage, that's not really going to work. So know that this key fob setup is your only option short of using some double-sided foam tape.With all that in mind, as long as you know now what you are and aren't getting, it works well, so only deducted one star for the battery issue and the single style holder.",

                "reviewText": "This GPS tracker is great. We have been using it for about a week and it has performed as well as the Apple trackers. The tracking is fast and accurate. Using the iPhone find my app I actually found that this tracker was tracking more accurately and updating more quickly than my kids iPhones. The tracker makes a sound to facilitate finding items such as keys around the house, however, it could be a bit louder. I found that the sound is easy to hear if the tracker is out in the open, however, if it is covered or in a pocket, it can be hard to hear. The item is water proof and stayed dry when submerged in water. The tracker is made for iPhone specifically and works great with the \"find my\" function. The tracker has a replaceable battery that should last a long time. It does require a pair of provided tools to open the tracker to change the battery that will need to be stored where you won't lose them. This tracker is also much cheaper than the iPhone version. At the time of this review, the Apple version was selling for $26, but I just bought another one of these trackers for $10.34. Overall, this GPS tracker is a great alternative if you are looking to save some money. It's very fast and accurate and a great value.",
