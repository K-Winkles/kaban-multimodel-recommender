                "reviewText": "I haven't had this long enough to report on its durability, but I am a little concerned about the clip that attaches to my GPS emergency beacon, as it feels a little cheap and brittle. It hasn't failed or anything, and it attached pretty easily, so I guess time will tell.As far as usefulness, it's great. I like that I can quickly detach it to check my map/location, and have it tethered to my shoulder strap. It attaches and detaches very easily, even with heavy winter gloves on. That alone makes it well worth the price. It's actually easier than using the clip/carabiner that came with the device.Overall, I would recommend this. It's an upgrade from the basic clip that my unit came with for sure.",
