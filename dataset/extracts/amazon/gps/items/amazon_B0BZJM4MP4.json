                "reviewText": "As someone who relies on tracking devices for various purposes, I have experienced the pros and cons of different options available on the market. While cellular-based trackers offer unmatched reliability by eliminating the need for some nearby devices to communicate, they often fall short when it comes to battery life. That's why I was apprehensive about their critical usage\u2014running out of battery at the worst possible moment is simply too frustrating.My search for a dependable solution led me to the UBITracer ZT-28E. This tracking device has exceeded my expectations with its exceptional battery performance. Unlike its competitors, which often leave you high and dry in terms of battery life, this UBITracer stands out with a longevity that's multiple times longer.In my personal experience this device has proven its mettle by lasting about 40 days while reporting every 15 minutes without missing any data points. That seems to be a significant advancement, ensuring that the device is up and running when I need it the most. If my usage only needs data every 2 hours, the device provides an impressive battery life of 7-8 months. That level of durability is unparalleled when compared with other cellular-based devices I have tried over the years!What sets the UBITracer ZT-28E further apart from other tracking solutions is its additional functionality\u2014the temperature logging feature. This added capability proves to be handy in a variety of scenarios. Placing the device inside a lunch box or a cooler allows me to effortlessly monitor the temperature of my food and beverages.I've also found it useful in my car. The UBITracer goes beyond simple tracking by notifying me if the temperature inside the vehicle exceeds safety levels. This feature for me is just curiosity but it can be valuable for families with infants and toddlers to avoid life-threatening heat in an idling car during summer times.The UBITracer has upgraded my tracking experience. Its unparalleled battery life has drastically reduced the constant worry of running out of power, giving me added peace of mind when I need it the most. The temperature logging feature further enhances its versatility, making it an useful companion for keeping food, drinks, and even loved ones safe.If you're tired of tracking devices with short battery life, I highly recommend giving this UBITracer a try. It may redefine your tracking experience and provide you with the peace of mind you deserve.",

                "reviewText": "As a GPS tracker, this device offers so much more than an Apple Airtag! Besides indicating the current location in real time (like an Apple Airtag does), this one will save travel histories in the app. The 1st image shows a trip starting from Boston, going northwest on Rt 2 to Orange, going southwest on Rt 202 to Palmer, getting on I-90 east using the Palmer on-ramp and finally ending the trip in Dedham. The concentration of green dots in Boston indicates slow traffic in the city!In addition to GPS tracking, the device also monitors and records temperature (as shown by the 2nd screenshot). I imagine dog owners would find this device incredibly useful: when they have to leave their dogs in the car while running errands, they can set a temperature level and receive warning if the temperatures inside the car exceed the level.",

Tried several different locations, and still no connection. Remove it, and it would connect. Unless you're going to put it on the top of your car and out in the open, it is not going to work very well for you. Unfortunately. Seems like this was going to be a good purchase but apparently not. Unfortunately not.",

                "reviewText": "This is actually a pretty cool little GPS tracking device. It tracks more than just gps, it also does temperature, and its own vitals. It is definitely for more than just tracking Vehicles though. Of course it could be for vehicles, but it offers many more features, that could be taking advantage of in many other ways. Set up was a breeze. Yes, you do have to get a subscription, but they have some pretty good deals on there. Including, for now and I'm sure in the future there is a 3-month free deal and then it's less than $15 a month after that. If you are worried about putting your personal info into a seemingly questionable app, prepaid credit cards are always an option. Available anywhere, and free, you take zero chance of identity theft, or loss of funds by using one. Plus if you're unsatisfied with the subscription, you don't even have to worry about canceling. After going through all the steps to set up the device, the device automatically goes through a setup phase of its own. Make sure you charge it before attempting to set it up, to make sure it has enough battery, sometimes it can be a lengthy process, so start the night before if possible. Personally, mine took about four and a half 5 hours to complete, and be ready for use. After shut up, the device works exactly as described. The first few points were not exactly accurate, but the more it travels around town the more accurate it seems to have gotten. The most frequent the subscription lets you set it to report, is 10 minutes not five. No matter what subscription you get, that is the limit for now. So the device actually overpowers the subscription capabilities, opposite of being obsolete. The device itself, also seems to be fairly durable. It is also water resistant, so it can be stuck in high humidity situations, but not submerged. Battery does last forever. It tells you its own limits for each setting you have it on. You can factor in info reports versus battery life, for your optimal settings. Overall, it is a great little device. Does exactly what it's supposed to, durable, accurate, easy to use and use your friendly, and priced to be disposable. Highly recommended.",
