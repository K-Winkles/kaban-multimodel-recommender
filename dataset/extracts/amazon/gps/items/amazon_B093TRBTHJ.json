That said it has some idiosyncrasies....When I want to use the map and move the map over to see the next location it goes all wierd and acts like a seesaw. The battery seems like it runs out too quick. I left it in the car overnight and left it on without the charger and the battery ran out. Then the planned trip was gone in the morning. But, back on the charger and it took a minute to put the trip back in.Overall, I am impressed. My ancient Garmin was easier to use but I wanted something that didn't need a very old flash drive card to update when the time comes.",

                "reviewText": "Original Review 8/20/21 [5 stars]: Took a chance on this \"renewed\" item. So far, so good. Out of the box it looked brand new. Updated the maps, which only took about 35 mins, and then used it for a trial run in familiar territory around Lake Michigan: MI, IL, WI, out to MN, back through the UP, and then down to where we started -- about 1800 miles. It preformed just fine, even while spending hours on the dash in the hot August sun. The only issue I had was an occasionally stubborn screen within the settings menu. Not sure if that's an issue in general with this model or not. That said, the screen is FAR more responsive when manipulating the map than my previous Garmin (a nuvi 1450 which lasted probably 13 years, so no complaints). The included attachment fit the dash mount I already have. GPS boots up and finds satellite connection quickly. There seems to be more ways to customize this model, I set it to show gas stations, hotels and restaurants. This was really helpful while we traveled rural county highways. It gives a tone and visual warning when a reduced speed zone is ahead (including school zones), I appreciate those. The curved road warnings I can do without, they can be pesky but I suppose may be useful after dark on a rural road. My old unit gave a visual indication of how many lanes split off on the interstate, this one gives verbal instruction, like \"be in any of the 3 right lanes\". I like that change. But if audible sounds become bothersome, there's a shortcut tools icon on the map (which can be customized) where muting the narrative or other other adjustments can be done easily. Didn't do anything to set up the traffic feature (thought I read that it needs to be enabled?), just worked automatically. It warned of construction, accidents, and other delays, including how much time to expect the delay to be. There were a few warnings of construction delays that didn't exist so I'm glad we didn't reroute on those. Overall, we found the maps to be accurate and the unit to be helpful while traveling. That's the goal. I considered other, less-expensive models, but am very glad I stuck with Garmin. It's a quality, reputable product. Amazon offers a 90 day return policy on this renewed item, that makes it worth trying IMO.Review Update 3/12/22: Months later, and beyond the return window, my GPS is starting to have some issues. Others have complained about the short battery life, true. But worse, mine goes dead within a week of not being used. Previous model could sit for months on a shelf between uses and still have some charge left. This is very annoying when needed for a spontaneous jaunt -or- when I want to program it at home before a trip. Need to charge it first, which takes HOURS. Also, the screen has become considerably more temperamental. No longer responsive to light touches, now I have to basically smash it. Again, don't know if these issues are typical for this model or because its a \"renewed\" unit. I'm bummed. Down to 3 stars as it does technically work as a GPS very well.",
