It defenitley has the best user interface and most options of all the Trackers ive seen. Now I can recommend.12/19/2020. Missed trips in evening of 12/18 and showing current location as one of the locations I was at last night. It does not track real time. Will be returning.12/18/2020. After reset of unit and update by Vyncs, so far has captured everything. Lisa with customer service at Vyncs was great, she responded very quick and eager to help. Thank You Lisa! Moving rating to 5 stars. If anything changes I will update.Edit: Vyncs contacted me through Email right away, wanting me to try a reset. I will try this and update after. Was impressed that they contacted me so quickly, on their own.So far, not too happy with this tracker. It seriously misses more trips than it gets. Missed every 20 mile trip to work this week, not seeing any part of it. Then missed todays 41 mile trip. One more missed trip, i will be returning it",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:After 6 months of use, I STILL LOVE THIS GEAR!!! :)The Android app works great. Notifies me every time to the alerts I have set. (It is set to alert me if the car goes over 70mph or if it enters or leaves any zones I program in: geofencing)In central Florida it has no problems at all with cellular reception or GPS reception.I LOVE how I can see fuel levels and the battery charge right from the website or the app!All of this gives me such piece of mind that I believe is well worth the price of this unit per year. Yes, you do have to pay annually, however, these 1 minute updates are well worth that cost to me.PS: It also alerted me to a vehicle recall about one week before I got the letter in the mail from my car dealer. :)I'm conclusion: I recommend this product to anyone even thinking of wanting something like this! This is the standard that others should aim for. If I had to say anything negative, the app and website could be designed better. However, they have never failed to function for me and they have made several improvements since I first purchased this 6 months ago. So, I have faith things will only get better.-------Original Review Below-------I bought the one that would give me minute by minute updates. I'm glad I did. It was very easy to set up, following the instructions. I am able to keep an eye on my elderly mother's trips and know that she is safe. And, if anything happens, I'll know exactly where she is too come help her on the side of the road.I use the web interface and the android app. Both work great.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Is this device a joke?",
                "reviewText": "There is a reason this has 30% one-star reviews as of this writing. First, I did know going in that while there was no monthly fee, there was a yearly fee....so basically, you pay 12 monthly fees in one \"handy\" installment.I received this device and registered/activated it, which was straight forward, although I did have to type in the MEID number three times during the process for some reason, which was annoying. Then, as instructed, I installed the device by plugging into the OBD-II port and went driving for 10 minutes or so. First, I was confused by the results, because rather than logging a \"trip\", which is defined as when you start the engine to when you shut off the engine, it merely showed the location of my car at various points during the trip. Under \"trips\", there was nothing listed. When back home, I looked at \"last known location\" and that was a little less than half a mile from my actual house.Not overly concerned, since some reviews had said it might take a bit to get all sync'ed up, I took four trips the next day. Only one of those trips was logged. What? What happened to the other three? I had set up a zone around my house so I would know when my kid was driving my car and had left home. I didn't get any notice when I left or entered that zone.Getting frustrated that this didn't seem to log much, I reset it as per the instructions that come with it.Over the next two days, NO trips at all were logged, only the \"last known location\" was logged. Now, this is supposed to wake up every hour and log it's location. It did that MAYBE once per day, not once per hour. I contacted support and they looked at the data and claimed my car had \"unusual electrical characteristics\" and said they may have to push an update to account for it. Note, this update was apparently going to disable most of the functionality aside from GPS. Things like mileage, check engine, and all that would be disabled. Since I bought this primarily for GPS, that wasn't too big a concern. They said it would be done within 24 hours. More than 24 hours later, I took the car out, again, nothing was logged.I did not use the car for a couple of days, and when I came out to start it, the battery was dead. How on earth can this tiny GPS/Cell Phone drain a relatively new battery in just a few days? I did see other people mention this as well. Also, I did pay extra for the 60-second updates, but it never worked well enough for me to see if I got that, since some people have complained they didn't get that when paying extra.So, since the device apparently did not work, AND it drained my battery, back it went. I will also say here that in addition to all of the above, the user interface on both the website and the app were horrible.I finally got a refund after two weeks, which is why I waited to make this review. It took two weeks, several emails, and finally contacting Amazon to get a refund. Interestingly, literally TEN MINUTES after Amazon opened a case with the seller, the refund was issued.By the way, I did go ahead and buy a Bouncie, which is $8 a month, so about the same yearly cost as this one. And, it flat out works like you want. Plug it in, and drive for a while, and everything is logged. Every single trip is logged, and the interface on both the app and website are intuitive and attractive. Save yourself some grief, and get that one.",

                "reviewText": "I have had two for 2 years now...works great! Has been a pretty reliable way to keep track of two cars. I mounted the units high up, under the dash, using an OBD2 extension cable. Also, the antenna side of the module (with the logo) should face up, towards the sky, for the best GPS and cellular signal strength. (the antenna side of the module is opposite the side with the square decal/label with barcodes). The system works 99% of the time, but sometimes the App doesn't work correctly...and it can't find the current location, or has not updated the location in a while. I suspect this happens when the Vyncs server is down, or is being updated. This is the most cost effective way to track your cars.",

                "reviewText": "Update 15-Jan-2018: Turns out the Vyncs tracker comes in one standard length (dimensions) which creates a problem on some cars. I can put the Vyncs on the Hyundai Accent OBD2 port discreetly to track the car discreetly. However, on a different car i.e. 2017 Hyundai Elantra GL, the Vyncs Tracker can't be put on discreetly. The OBD2 Port Cover cannot be put on (closed) with the Vyncs tracker applied on the port, the tracker sticks out & is clearly visible to the driver thus rendering this device useless for discreet tracking purposes. In addition, Vyncs customer service is terrible, horrible, and indifferent to customer concerns. I would give Vyncs an Oscar for terrible customer service.For the above reasons, I am going to give it only two stars.Vyncs needs to give serious consideration to miniaturizing this device to make it fit on all OBD2 ports discreetly.Update 17-Jan-2018: Wish I could give this item zero stars for arrogant & indifferent customer service. After I posted the 15-Jan-2018 negative review, the Seller Agnik locked-out my account on their website. Now, I cannot access my GPS trackers to know to track my vehicles, despite the fact that the seller Agnik is legally obligated to provide me with the 1-yr of in-built tracking service (already pre-paid) which is valid until 24-Aug-2017. I have never seen a business whose business philosophy is to cause permanent harm to customers & to scam them by not providing the service they are legally obligated to provide. The seller acts in an arbitrary & heavy-handed manner by locking-me out from my own account. I will not buy any items from Agnik again even if they are given away for free. Buyers Beware!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________This review is for the Vyncs Pro car GPS tracker.In one word....the product is AWESOME. It performs the way it is designed to perform and explained. It has met and exceeded my high expectations.I bought the Vyncs Pro as a peace of mind to know the whereabouts, location, speed, etc. for a new driver.",
