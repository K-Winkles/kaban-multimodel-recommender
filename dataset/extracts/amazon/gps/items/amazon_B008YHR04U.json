                "reviewText": "I love this product am able to locate and killed the engine on my truck. Connection the GPS and kill switch is very difficult. It took me about four hours to do some research and look for ignition wire. The technician support was helpful but was still not easy. I tried to get alarm installer to install it but the price to get it installed was pricey. I wished that the hardwired was plug and play. The GPS is off about 50 feet and when vehicle is parked for a few days. The GPS will send text messages saying it out perimeter which that not true. My nephew decided to go for joy ride with my truck and I was receiving texts on engine is on, speeds , with location. I was able to kill the engine immediately. My nephew and friends were stranded. I received call from him 45 minutes later saying that he had emergency and needed the truck he was sorry but now the truck is stalled won\u2019t start. Lol. Now , when I leave I disable it. I love this product. I wish the monthly subscription was cheaper with the same abilities . They do have cheaper plans but are limited to what you can do with the GPS. This is better then any alarm system plus a lot cheaper than vipers alarms. I haven\u2019t seen car alarm that you can kill the engine immediately. This is better than Onstar because You will need a police officer to assist you with Onstar to recover your vehicle. This product you can recover you vehicle without any assistance.",

I'm not sure if you have to upgrade it to see more. FOR THE PRICE IT IS GREAT AND DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO",
