                "reviewText": "This is my fourth Garmin motorcycle GPS model over 20 years, replacing a zumo XT (actually 3 of them over 5 months) I'd tried earlier this year but Garmin fully refunded my money due to too many issues on the XT. Once I read about the zumo 396 LMT-S, I was intrigued that it had many of the same, newer features of the zumo XT which I really enjoyed but the price was much lower because it didn't have things which weren't important to me. The 396's screen can be customized to display a wealth of information, and although obviously smaller than the XT's screen it is large enough to easily read all of the available while riding. Initially I was concerned that the 396's screen may not be bright enough in full sunlight, but even when wearing my darkest sunglasses there is never an issue and the non-glare screen works very well (the reflection/glare seen in one of my screen pictures was made solely by my camera - zero glare or reflection to the naked eye). As expected, the touchscreen works fine with gloves just like every other Garmin product I've used. The mount is much more secure and easier to use than the XT's, which I never liked or got used to. I've bought a second 396 mounting bracket and power cable for my second bike, and look forward to many years and miles of service from this GPS which I consider a bargain.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a motorcycle tour guide, and need this for business. Garmin has always been solid, and for the most part I love this little unit.The touchscreen is great, and it has nearly every road I'd want to take, except for some really funky side roads which it can struggle with. The maps are good, but not great (its not google maps, if you're used to those). It has nearly everything you'd want, but falls short on some of the details.The PRO's: Price. For a solid waterproof GPS that can take a pounding, its hard to beat.- Ease of Use: really easy to use, with some nice features. The live traffic updates are useful.- The RAM mount ---- I love that they added it, and it mounts on nearly any bike out there with standard sized bars.The CON's -- The software sorta blows, if you're planning out a long trip. Basecamp could use a serious upgrade. IT works, but you gotta dance to make it work. Whomever said its straight out of the 90s was dead on.- Your settings will overwrite things sometimes and change your routes. I didn't like that part, and had to put in my own, extra waypoints to keep me on the routes I wanted to ride.- The mount: its killer if you want to hard wire it to your bike --- I didn't. I use an AC Adapter so I can move it to another bike, and ended up sawing a corner of the mount off just so I could make it work with a standard AC adapter. that part, could have been thought out a little bit better.I'm happy with it, it works well and has a lot of features. Its just a hair short of getting that last star which would have made me love this thing.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this GPS for over a year and about 10,000 miles.Pros: The building quality is good and the mounting was easy. It has been through many rain storms and still works fine. The screen does a good job of being mostly anti-glare.Cons: I hate this thing. We just don't get along. The phone app is so invasive I had to uninstall it. The only way to close the app is to turn off bluetooth. So then whenever you turn on your bluetooth for your car or ear buds, the app is running again. What a joke, no other app I have ever used is so invasive. I found it much less annoying to use my phone as a wireless access point and just connect to its wifi.This GPS feels like 20 year old technology, and I used to love my old Garmins from 20 years ago. It is just very hard to get this GPS to plan a good route or respond to your driving styles. For example, it only gives you one route at the start, you can't select alternate routes like Google Map or Waze. If you decide to take a different major highway to get to your destination, it can't figure out you are going a different way even after 45 minutes of it telling you to make a u-turn every half mile. I find myself having to stop frequently to get my phone out and redirect this thing.It doesn't show live traffic. It will have a small pop up screen to tell you if there is an accident ahead and ask if you want to redirect. However, the buttons are so small, that you can't really safely use them if you are actually riding the bike.The zooming in/out while riding is terrible. It doesn't do it as well as my Garmins did 20 years ago. It is nearly impossible to do while actually riding, and a lot of times, you miss the + or - signs and get stuck in some mode that you have to back out of to get back to the normal view.There are many rural areas where it doesn't even show county roads, just blank white areas. I've tried zooming in and out, but see the note above about how hard that is, but many of the roads are just not there at any zoom level.This thing just takes a lot of the fun out of riding a motorcycle. I am going to throw it away and find something better.",

The U shaped screw that goes around the bars was too small. My fault for not checking this earlier. I made a few improvisions and got it set up. We rode from Manitoba Canada down to Branson MO. Drove to AR, then over to the Cherohala Skyway and the Tail of the Dragon, and back home in 2 wks. We relied strictly on this gps. Someday hear was up to +30C, and we also had 2 rain storms. At one point the screen split so you could see what the hwy looked like and the other should the lane that you should be in our of six lanes. I was extremely impressed!",

                "reviewText": "Was super pumped to have a dedicated GPS while on my motorcycle L's. Unfortunately the one I got was faulty on arrival- screen randomly shuts off, randomly would select menus and take me out of the map while riding and navigating. Often cancelled its own navigation route and go into the media menu. I believe it may be a faulty digitizer along with some other circuit related issue that caused it to shut down whenever it pleased. It also would dim the screen to barely visible at random points even if it was wired in correctly or on battery, with settings to not dim. Other than these issues that had me decide to return / refund, it was speedy for a small gps and found locations relatively quickly. The keyboard was... unusual but easy to get used to. I do recommend it, honestly. Hopefully you don't get unlucky like me. Safe riding!",
