                "reviewText": "Easy to set up and use. One has to get creative in placing the unit. I my State, cops don't like the idea your \"blocking\" your front window with your GPS! The unit is small enough to place almost anywhere below the dashboard. In my sports car I have it mounted to the console in my Jeep it fits between my instruments. No matter where I put it, it still gets a signal. I can hear it most anywhere. I like it can give you one or more \"alternate routes\" Great for the unexpected construction or maybe you just want to take the \"scenic\" route. Warns you of camera intersection and speed limits heavily enforced. An excellent unit and almost a necessity if you aren't sure of where you are going!",

                "reviewText": "Garmin Drive 50 USA LM I bought this GPS unit as a backup for google maps on my Nexus 5 for a cross country trip from IL to CA. Surprisingly by the end of the trip, I found myself using the Garmin about 99% of the time. I am comparing this unit against google maps that I use 99% of the time otherwise.The reasons I like this better than google maps:1. The split screen was really informative - especially with large lane guidance in unfamiliar areas and upcoming stops displayed next to the map without having to navigate away from the live map. This may not be a problem with long stretches of roads but in a city for example, the ability to show important stops like gas, food and rest stops without having to risk going away from the map and losing a turn.2. The \"Up next\" info was probably the most useful feature for me as the three most important things during a long trip Viz. Food, Fuel and rest areas are very conveniently shown next to the map. This allowed me to get fuel at the upcoming gas station if the next one after that (whose distance was also shown as part of what's up next information) was going to be 100 miles away. This saved my from running out of fuel a couple of times in the middle of the AZ/NM/NV area.3. The current speed limit was very helpful and I found it was about 100 yards off from the signs posted (i.e. the GPS took about 100 yards to catch up with the posted speed limit signs). This is better than google maps which does not have any such information at all.4. Offline navigation! This in itself was the main reason I brought a dedicated GPS unit and I was not disappointed! I shudder to think of not having navigation in the middle of Arizona/Utah because of lack of phone coverage.After using a dedicated GPS (while coming from a position of skepticism of it's usefulness over google maps), I will say that I probably will be using this GPS for all my long distance driving over using my phone (and leave my phone always connected to the charger). But for inner city navigation, I still prefer google maps/waze for almost instantaneous traffic based navigation.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't gotten to use this much yet since it's still winter here and Maine and most of my traveling is during the summer since I'm a photographer. I'll be likely updating the review by then. In the meantime, I'm on the fence though it has more pros than cons. I love the larger screen compared to my old TomTom and the much better quality graphics. I'm also a constant second guesser so having a split screen when it comes to highway exits is nice as well. It's been pretty accurate so far except for when I have to hop on the northbound highway from my home. I kid you not, the gps made me drive ALL the way to the end of the road that the on-ramp is on and then made me turnaround on some strange side street before heading back to the on-ramp and taking it! It was 5 more minute of driving when it was completely unnecessary. Mind you, there is no clock or one-way turn onto the northbound on-ramp so I have no idea why it insists I do that. Now, I just double check which ramp I need and then skip that step Haha But so far it's the only real complaint I have. I mainly purchased this because it comes with lifetime map updates and I was tired of my old outdated gps and refused to pay for something that I feel should be included. It's the reason I don't use my in-dash gps in my Jeep because I refuse to pay for updates. Anyway, it's the perfect side, great quality, easy to read, doesn't have a super annoying voice and even has a green suv/jeep icon which is actually what I drive so bonus Haha",

                "reviewText": "Much better directions than my wife's GPS on her cell phone and safer as well. Gets a little funny sometimes when switching between shortest distance and fastest route but it will get you there. Traffic works great in town but peters out about 30 miles outside of Boston. It comes in on an FM band so it probably just can't get reception that far out.Early notifications are fantastic, for things like which lane to be in or approaching roundabouts. Very occasionally will think you aren't on the street you are on but it's fun hearing the alerts like \"You are not on a road\" or \"You are going the wrong way down the street.\" That cracks my kids up. It's just a very nice tool to have.",

It arrived with a screen protector saying \"This product is ready to use\" but until it is charged, it isn't. I had previously downloaded the Manual and that does not warn about the need to be fully charged. Very inadequate user instructions.12-23-17 update. I've used this for a month and am very happy with it. The voice is loud and clear and the driving directions adjust to my alterations to the recommended route. When it realizes I'm not taking the recommended turns it automatically corrects and gives me new directions based on where I am. The screen image is clear and crisp and easy to see mounted on the dash. Highly recommend the Portable Friction Mount to secure it to the dash. It took me a while to discover that I could remove the camera from the Mount without having to pull it off the little ball...there is a release on the back of the device that allows for removal of the device leaving the connector attached to the ball.",
