Now I know, not the device or the app have problems, but I need to set apn for the device. It is worthwhile to deal with it.My opinion:The device is valuable, works flawlessly and is simply a force for this price.The app works flawlessly and can even be extended for multiple trackers.The service from China is outstanding!In detail:The device arrived as usual fast (Prime) and perfectly packed. The scope of delivery includes a charging cable, a transport bag and various SIM card adapters as well as a user manual, which is admittedly incomplete(You can email the seller for help!)The setup of the tracker was fast in a few minutes and the communication with the device via SMS worked immediately flawlessly, the tracker sends back a Google Maps link with its current location. The accuracy is outstanding. Then it became tricky: The download of the app and the installation were still uncomplicated, unfortunately, the app did not work at all. The app always showed that the tracker was offline. After several attempts to change the settings, I wanted to give up and send the device back, because the app is crucial for me. As a last attempt, I contacted the Chinese service via email and shared my phone number for a whatsapp contact. To my surprise, after only a few minutes, I got an answer and a friendly employee of the seller went through all the settings with me via whatsapp. An outstanding service, where so many companies have to be measured! The communication was in English. Problem found and solved!1. GPS Offline means (you can guess): the device does not have GPS/2G reception. So get out on the balcony and test there.2. Device is offline means that there is no internet connection. In the vast majority of cases, including me, it is due to missing or incorrect APN entries. This one gets from the network provider of the sim card, which is in the tracker. My mobile APN information I have also found on the web. I had simply entered the wrong APN name. Immediately after the change to the right value, the tracking also worked perfectly with the app and still does it today. It's great what this little device does.Important:The Tracker SIM card must have data volumesThe APN information must be entered correctlyGPS works (of course) only outsideSuper Feature: The app lets (apparently) only track one device. On demand, I learned from the service, that if you want to monitor several trackers in the app at the same time, they will create a special account, so it is perfect for vehicle rental, etc.Conclusion: do not be frustrated, this is where EVERYTHING works! If not, it's probably not on the tracker or the app. Great product, excellent service!",

GPS and sims card. if you purchase the GPS you have to have the Sims card you can't just buy the GPS and expected to work by itself.You Can't purchase the GPS expected to work, It needs the Sims card & Charge on GPS lasted one day! I have not responded from anyone and if you look at the order I bought two sim cards because the first one did not make some reason it got lost or damaged. my GPS still not working and its been almost a year.

                "reviewText": "This is actually my first gps tracker that I have purchased. I had difficulty setting it up. It took about 3 tries to get it starting. This product comes with a GPS tracker, USB port without the head to charge, a tiny bag where I put the USB port meanwhile the gps is already in use, & a manual. I bought the recommended SIM CARD because it was not included. I purchased the $5 monthly subscription to try it out.So far I like: the battery life has lasted a week. It\u2019s at 90%, I changed it to 12 hour mode stand by. I think it turns on every time the car moves. Which I believe should save some battery life. I chose this product mainly for the app. It took me about a week to decided what I was looking for. I read through these reviews and I was happy to read most of them. The bad reviews, I believe they expect it to work as a $500 dollar product. I paid about $60 all together & it works great. It has magnets so it\u2019s a plus. They work really well. Just have to find a good area so it doesn\u2019t fall. Thus far, I like the product mainly for the app. It is easy to navigate once you get it started.I disliked: that it was a bit hard to get it starting. Just follow the instructions and you\u2019ll get it. Yes, that\u2019s what I thought. I would msg the command and after the 5th command it wouldn\u2019t reply. I was frustrated and would put it away. I emailed them and I got no response. I still have not gotten a response back from them. So if you get an email, keep it. I believe it had a number on it. I accidentally deleted it, & regret I did.My 3rd attempt Setup:1.) Get your SIM CARD number ( it doesn\u2019t say in the instructions) by logging in their carrier website.2. ) insert SIM CARD & charge the GPS tracker.3.) follow manual instructions.4.) I commanded for GPS to turn on5.) I commanded for GPRS to turn on6.) check for blue & yellow lights blinking.7.) then I connected to the APP & it worked8.) i changed every other commands through the app once I was able to connect the app with the gps tracker.9.) now it\u2019s being used and I only use the app to locate the tracker.",
