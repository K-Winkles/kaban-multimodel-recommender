Has av hook ups and remote wire for an amp but nothing to control bass. Even in the equalizer menu you cannot change the bass like you should. The loud button distorts the sound coming out of the speakers so it\u2019s useless. Shows that there is a Bluetooth option but is no where to be found and no way to connect Bluetooth to the radio. The only way you can hook up is through USB then you can use the phone link for apple play. Back up camera is great on bright sunny days, any other time it\u2019s like the play back video in a 1990s 7-11. But for $70 this is a cheap ok option for a double din radio",
