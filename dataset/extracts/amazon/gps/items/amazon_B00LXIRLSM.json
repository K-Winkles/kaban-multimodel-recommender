                "reviewText": "I took a chance on the refurbished model and I'm sure glad I did. We went on a 950 mile trip to Mississippi and the Garmin was a huge help on the trip. Worked flawlessly and the 6\" screen was just the right size for easy reading. I especially like the way the screen splits and you get a view of the exit coming up ahead. Really makes it easy to understand which lane you need to be in. So glad we bought this and even more pleased that I saved a chunk of money by getting the refurbished model. The only thing that seemed out of date was the location of restaurants and gas stations. I downloaded the latest update for the maps before we left and still the Garmin didn't recognize a few of the gas stations we passed. But businesses come and go, so I imagine they can't stay on top of all of them. Overall, the unit worked great and we were more than pleased with the purchase.",

It's easy to tell what it wants you to do even with the sound off (I hate having the little voice constantly ordering me around), and the menu is reasonably easy to figure out, though it's not the MOST intuitive electronic device I've ever used (managed to figure out all the normal stuff like home, saves, favorites, north orientation vs forward orientation, etc without ever looking up directions). I bought this brand over other popular ones because you have the option to navigate to map coordinates (not just roads, addresses), helpful for destinations like little-known hiking trails that aren't in the data bank.",

I was provided a cord for plugging into my car and this thing tells me that I need to use the cord provided for it to charge while in use. Well I am, I keep getting the same error message even though I bought a USB cord and plugged it in that way and still it tells me that I need to use the proper cord for this unit. They both are Garmin cords, this is a Garmin Unit. It turns off during navigation because it isn't holding a charge during the time I have it plugged in. I need something I can depend on and my phone is more dependable than this thing is. I have a very defective unit and not happy for the amount of money I paid for this thing and end up with a lemon. I have even downloaded the new software for it and still it doesn't work properly. I have never had a problem with refurbished products but this takes the cake.

I would recommend this refurbished Garmin GPS for anyone that is price conscious. (like me.)The one con is the battery life; it runs down in about an hour. Not like the 4 hour run time of my older Garmin GPS.All in all, this is a very good buy.",
