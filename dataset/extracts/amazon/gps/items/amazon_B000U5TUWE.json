                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Shockingly freakishly good dash mount: HOW DOES THIS EVEN WORK???",
                "reviewText": "This is the most amazing usable inexpensive simple wonderous dash-mount ever invented by any culture in any age.I'm being 100% sincere.I have the oddly heavy TomTom XXL 540TM 5-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator, a Toyota Highlander with their signature misshapen and oddly textured dashboard and I am a shockingly terrible driver. I'm not proud of this fact, but I feel that you need to understand how truly bad a driver I actually am to appreciate how truly superior and ingenious this dash mount is.Allow me to explain.I gun my car violently when the light changes because, one, it makes me feel like a super bad race-car driver, (woo woo!) and two, because I don't want to lose to the guy in the '91 Honda with the bumper duct-taped on in the lane next to me. (Can I get a shout out from other people who know this feeling?? I'M NOT LOSING TO YOU 18 YEAR OLD TAPED CAR DRIVER!!)As an added bonus, this rocket-like propulsion ensures that I will get the worst possible gas mileage possible. I'm close to Hummer territory here and I drive a flipping Toyota. That bad.It is said that the brakes on my car are very good so I take every opportunity possible to make sure I test them by using them suddenly and often randomly when I think I see a mammal or leaf or bag or shadow crossing the road.I tend to steer in the direction in which my eyes go so help all or any passengers if there's anything interesting to either side of me. Lots of interesting stuff to see on the roads here in Los Angeles; shops, the ocean, sofas and settees fallen from trucks on the freeway.I could go on, but it's getting to the point where a local chapter of feminists have petitioned me to undergo a gender reassignment so I'll stop reenforcing stereotypes about terrible women drivers.****Only this part is untrue. This is Los Angeles, feminists don't live here, they all live in San Francisco and judge my terrible driving from afar.My husband will deny all claims besmirching his driving prowess, but his testing of this mount is equally strict and frequent as he tends to see curbs as challenges rather than impediments.For the sake of nuptial bliss, I will refrain from further comment on that topic, a subject he vehemently and yet unconvincingly denies and get on with my review.I had used a stick-to-the-dash type of holder before with no big issue until the sticky wore off rendering it useless and I had to look for a new dash holder. The old type of mount left the sticky residue on my bumpy dash after it fell off.Tres unchic, and as you surely can infer from my driving a mid-size Toyota, I am ALL ABOUT the chic and visual aesthetics are a foremost concern. Speaking of aesthetics I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this mount resembles a black beanbag chair you might find in the apartment of a very midcentury modern guinea pig. This in no way is to be taken as a slight.It is what it is.I came across this dash mount here on Amazon and couldn't understand just from what was written how this actually \"stuck\" to the dash (what is this \"friction magic\" of which you speak??) and had even less faith it would work with my stupid heavy Tomtom, my slalom rapid-fire kamikaze driving and my odd misshapen dash.Even after using this mount for over half a year, I cannot tell you what mysterious sorcery keeps the sand-sackesque mount on my dash, but it really truly actually works.It has yet to fall off ever. Seriously. Even with all my unnecessarily sharp lane changes, my dime stops, and my F1-like squealing starts; this miracle mount stays on.And then you can just lift it off when you arrive at your destination leaving no sticky residue, absolutely no hassle, and no people targeting your sweet ride because of your mad hardware.(You fellow Toyota owners will understand this fear of being targeted for the sweetness of your ride and hardware.)I will only ever use this type of dash-mount again, but since there are no breakable parts, I will never ever need to replace it ever for anything. I want to buy these for everybody everywhere. More Surperlatives!I did also buy a separate arm mount to use with this because other reviewers pointed out a lack of depth in this mount with their unit.Using this, ARKON TTEP115 TomTom EasyPort Windshield / Dash Mount the Tomtom peeks over the end of this mystical magic mount and the combination works perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Furrion backup camera monitor for our RV that kept falling off of the windshield. When looking for mount alternatives, I purchased both the clam shell style holder and the Bracketron Nav-Mat Portable GPS Dash Pad to try. Since our pickup dashboard had a small storage area on the center of it, I needed an item that would fit in the space, or was flexible enough to sit in the area without wobbling. The Bracketron Nav-Mat Portable GPS Dash Pad conforms well to the dashboard storage area, stays in place, and the suction platform works great. My only wish is that the dash pad was a bit smaller in circumference, but overall it fits the bill. 2morrow approved!",

                "reviewText": "For $11.50 (and no shipping, due to our Prime account) this is a very decent purchase. I drive a Civic Hybrid, and the larger friction mats are just too big for where I want to place the GPS. I was tired of attaching the suction mount to the windshield and dealing with the tell-tale suction marks.The mat will not budge, the suction stays sucked, and the mat is a great size for the dash. It's hefty but not overwhelming, and it feels well-made.So why three stars? The suction mount for the Garmin 760 isn't tall enough to let the GPS clear the \"donut\" portion of this mat. That means even after pushing the GPS (as much as I dare push an expensive little electronic device) the GPS sits tilted up, toward the sun, and attracts glare. (I uploaded a picture I took with my Blackberry.)Still, for long drives, and I do take a lot of them, I can put up with the nuisance of not seeing the screen as well as I'd like and being able to quickly disconnect the GPS and put it in the purse and throw the mat in the glovebox while I run into a gas station market. A taller GPS mount would cure this, obviously.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely brilliant!!! Our new sat nav is bigger than our last one, and the mount is taller, making it top-heavy. The dashboard mat, which worked like a dream with our old sat nav, simply couldn't do the job. The new sat nav 'took off' at the first hill combined with a bend - complete with firmly attached mat! Having read hundreds of reviews for all sorts of designs - majority saying dash must be totally flat, which ours isn't - this one sounded hopeful. It is superb! Sat nav sits securely on its nest. Doesn't even wobble, let alone move! One tip - to attach sat nav mount to the centre disc, it needs to be on a firm, flat surface (did mine on kitchen worktop) - or it will come off. Once properly attached, it is incredibly secure - no danger of them parting company (and can be stored as a pair, ready for next time) and the really weighty base ensures it sits like a rock, exactly where it's put. Really prompt delivery and excellent value for money.",

However, the problem with the Tom Tom 720 is that the mount is small and doesn't work when trying to mount in a horizontal position (as opposed to vertical). So before I could use the Nav Mat I needed to get an \"Arkon suction mount arm\" (available from Morpeth Mobiles). This arm is great, is easier to attach /detach than the standard mount and has much better suction.The combination of these two bits of kit mean that it is a very stable (no slipping about whatsoever) mount for the Tom Tom and vibration free. When not in use is quickly & easily stored in the glovebox (with mount still attached to mat), leaving no telltale marks on the windscreen. Other Satnavs (that can be mounted horizontally on the dash) would obviously not need the extra Arkon mount.",
