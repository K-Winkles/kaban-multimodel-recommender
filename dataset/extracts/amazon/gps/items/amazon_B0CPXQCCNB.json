                "reviewText": "The size of the tracker is really small and I like that it's black -you can easily hide anywhere. I think it's not good for spying on someone because it's not live but to protect your assets it's the best solution I found on the market. Also I like that there are small holes for screws to attach it, personally I don't trust magnets. Highly recommend it !",
