So I needed a custom mount, one that attaches to my dashboard.I bought similar brackets before, so that I could keep a bracket on the suction mount that came with the unit (for use in other vehicles), and so that I could construct a wrist-mount, for extended pedestrian use.I bought this particular bracket in order to construct a tabletop mount, to use the unit when traveling by train. The price was right, and it was quite easy to incorporate into a small plastic easel.",
