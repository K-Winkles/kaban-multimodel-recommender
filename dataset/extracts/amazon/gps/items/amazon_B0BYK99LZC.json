Pedro with technical support reached out to say hi and introduce himself after I activated it. I asked a question about the reporting and he was quick and thorough with a response. Installation was easy enough. Teen is mechanically inclined so I had to be sneeky. Just add power and ground and it was good to go.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to monitor my motorcycle while it's being rented on Riders Share. I looked at quite a few trackers, but all of them had some kind of flaw. One of them was very similar to this GPS7000 tracker, but cost over $300 and had to be shipped from Europe. I was skeptical of this purchase and even bought another alternative in case this didn't live up to my expectations. Thankfully, and unless something changes later, I believe this hard-wired tracker to be the best bang for the buck.-Pros:Very very inexpensive. Not only is the device cheap, the subscription (along with the 10 day free trial which is cool) is one of the cheapest monthy fees for these types of trackers.Very easy to install and get up and running through the website. There's even an app available for Android and Apple devices!Fast updates, I think somewhere around 30 second intervals, more than enough for my needs. This includes some telemetry data including speed, distance, time. The data reporting can also be customized to show stops, parking/idles, initial and final positions, and speeding which is adjustable.You can setup daily/weekly/monthly reports to your email as well as set up notifications on when there's movement, speeding, electrical disconnection, or exiting geofences.A cool feature that I didn't know it included is the ability to show when the ignition is on and the voltage of the battery. I'm not sure if an alarm can be setup for when the battery gets below a threshold, but I imagine there's a way.-Cons:There is a montly fee, so you're purchasing a device that will need service. I'm not sure which network it's on, but it works in rural areas for me.Indoors reception (in a garage) is non-existent. I'm not sure how tunnels or parking garages fare but I imagine not very well. I have this behind plastic so there shouldn't be any interference. Outside with a clear view to the sky I usually hover around 30 connected satellites.This being a small business, I'm not sure how long the app/web portal will be available. It's here today, but might be gone tomorrow.I'm not sure how much this will drain the battery over time. I'll have to do some additional testing and see.-So I watched the included video and saw \"gosafe\" on the device. But when I looked the brand up it came back with devices that are quite expensive for both the tracker and the subscription. When I opened the package, it does indeed say \"gosafe\" and I believe these may have been bought wholesale. They shipped from Florida and digging into the backend shows these are GPS tracking and IoT solutions through gurtam.com. The app looks like a rebrand of Wialon.If you're looking for a cheap tracker that can be wired to a vehicle, this might be one of the best options out there.",

But after figuring out they will send you your sign in information by email it worked pretty well. Very easy to install. It also at least so far is working and pretty accurate and real time. I would buy another one tomorrow. Just need some better instructions on how the process works would help.Update: overall it\u2019s been a week and the unit is working pretty well. It\u2019s close enough to live for me even when you might have some minimal delay with updating. I mean like 39 seconds or a minute or so delay. For the cost of the unit and monthly charge I can easily deal with that\u2026overall I\u2019m impressed with the unit and the customer service. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to purchase more from them.",
