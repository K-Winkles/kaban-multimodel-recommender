I love the features; in particular as you are approaching a street that street name appears on the screen which is excellent for going someplace new for the first time. The other feature I love is as you are approaching exits on a freeway, the screen splits in two; 1) it shows where you are currently traveling and 2) the number/name of the exit. I like the smaller size of the unit too. My old one was 5 inches across and this is only 4 inches. Thanks Garmin I love this product!!",

I just love how the screen divides when you get to an exit and it shows you and tells you exactly what exit to take!! My husband & I were just floored the first time we used it and it did that!! :)I will recommend this to anyone!! Thanks again for such a wonderful product!!",
