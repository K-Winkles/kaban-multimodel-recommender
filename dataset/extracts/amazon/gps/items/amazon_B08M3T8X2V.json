Small and Powerful This tracker may be small in size, but it has more power than meets the eye. It will detect movement, speed, direction, location, and more all in real-time. It is only 3.11 x 1.5 x 1.75 inches so you will be able to hide it or travel with it conveniently and confidently. Position Report Frequency Customizable frequency reports at your disposal. You have the control to change how often your GPS tracker reports at any time. The less frequent reporting will allow your tracker\u2019s battery to last longer while the more frequent reporting will make the trail more detailed. We recommend keeping your tracker at the default setting of 1 minute reporting frequency for long battery life combined with a detailed track. You can set the frequency to 10 or 30 second reporting at no extra charge. Backpacks and Luggage Place your tracker inside a backpack of a loved one, your luggage, or your laptop bag. You can fit this tracker almost anywhere and have the confidence and peace of mind that you will be able to locate your loved one or important possessions at any moment from the tip of your fingers.",
