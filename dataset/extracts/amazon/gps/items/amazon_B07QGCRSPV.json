                "reviewText": "Bought my first sinotrack back in 2020. But the one i got is only 3g. Back then the support was very helpful and friendly. He walked me through every step very patiently. Unfortunately the tmobile stopped the 3g network so i have no choice but to get the 4glte version. I liked it thats why i got the new version last month. Setting up was easy like before and i was surprised how fast it is and very stable connection. But i ran into some issues with some features. The shake alarm, acc alarm, sos is not working. So i contacted support for some help. first it wont accept control number (my phone number) I got it figured out myself and now the features. I explained to her what was the issue. And i sent her the RCONF for her to see. I guess she didnt pay attention and asked to send it so i told her i already send it but i sent it again. Never got any solution from her she only reply with another question once a day and asked me to do things i already done. Then finally she got upset and told me that i was asking too many questions and she got confused. So i made it easier and told her that shake alarm is not working but the Rconf shows its on. Then she never replied anymore. She\u2019s igoring me. Now the device keeps sending me sms and a phone call from sos alarm. Im getting shake alarm now but only when ita moving and acc on. Sos keeps sending every 10 mins 24/7. After a few search online and patience, i managed to figure out. Now i got it under control without the help of support. Manual is lacking information. I got some features turned on its not even in the manual. Its really a good device but a lot of missing information in the manual. And support is the worst. Rude and unhelpful. So i dont recommend this tracker anymore because of tech support. Good product bad customer service.",

I was leary because this looks exactly the same as my 3G tracker but to my surprise it works on the 4G network. It is very easy to use and the only monthly fee is what ever you pay for the cell service through your provider. I don't use mine through the app but rather through text messages. I simply call the number and it responds with a text with its location on a Google map link. Very easy to install and use.",

This did the job.Once setup, it works great. First one I got, the killswitch on the app worked backwards. Exchanged for another one and it's working correctly.You can't change the system(kph to mph). Shouldn't really be an issue as I'm only using it for tracking and killswitch. But it would be nice to be able too.Also nice to be able to use different mobile SIM.",
