Just had to take my shot.Each time it restarted I had to select the course again. All of the scores I had entered were gone. Had to enter them again.The last hole was a par 3 over water and this almost went in the water because I was so frustrated with it.Haven\u2019t had a chance to see how it synced to the database.Also had a couple of times where I was standing at the 100 or 150 yard markers and it told me I was over 200 yards out.What a mistake buying this.
