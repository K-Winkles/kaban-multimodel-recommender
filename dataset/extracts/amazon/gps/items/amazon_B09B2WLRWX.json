It's helped me keep track of my phone and my keys - if I misplace either one, I trigger it from the other, either the app on my phone or the button on the tile on my keychain. To get the most from it you should pair it with a smartphone on an active contract, leave Bluetooth on and battery saver off. If the phone isn't on contract you'll still get some functionality, or you can get extra features from Tile if you sign up, but it's pretty useful right out of the box.",

So it makes for a very descrete tracking device in case my car gets stolen or to easily locate it in a car park.",

I liked it so well I bought one for my mom. I rated it down one star because while demonstrating how it works for my mom, it did not work. I pushed the button twice on the tile but my phone didn't sound the alert. I just turned off my bluetooth on my phone then turned it on again and that fixed it. I love the security of being able to find my phone with my tile, or find my keys with my phone, especially if I'm running late for work.",

                "reviewText": "I am not impressed with the tile network. Often, it an not locate the tiles even within 5 feet of your phone. I've spent a lot of time on this, trying to get the tiles to ring and for the phone to ring when you press the tile's button. I replaced the batteries which are CR2032. I also ordered the The Wallet. That thing constantly rings your phone when you put it in your wallet and sit, but rarely works when you try to find it.Bad tech. Waste of money. I'm currently trying other alternatives.",

I have used Tile products for years in my purse, wallet, keys, luggage, etc. I decided to just give these to my family and they even have to admit that these are loud and do the job wonderfully. You can hear a Tile and just follow the sound from downstairs or another room. I know from experience. The Tile app shows the location so you know if you left something at the airport or a house or anywhere. You can even connect with other Tile users nearby to find things. They've really improved it over the years so I remain a faithful customer.",
