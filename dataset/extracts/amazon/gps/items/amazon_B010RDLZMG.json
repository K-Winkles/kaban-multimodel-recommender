                "reviewText": "I drive a delivery truck and I have multiple problems with how Garmin routes me.It has frequently marked locations incorrectly: Address at wrong end of the street; corner address marked on wrong street because of the building is technically closer to that street, versus the street that shares the ACTUAL address --- this also goes for marking an address completely off of it's real street and selecting a walkway, alley, or backroad, or even a road on the other side of the property that is not part of the address whatsoever, sometimes routing me a mile away or more.The \"DEZL\" edition I have allows me to put in vehicle dimensions, but it seems to keep routing me incorrectly, or is simply not up to date with road restrictions. So this is pretty bad for trying to an efficient route in more rural areas.Aside from that, Garmin doesn't seem to understand routing priorities for \"shorter\" and \"faster\" routes. I have often been redirected to the \"faster\" routes merely because of speed limits... not that \"If I turn here, I'll arrive 5 minutes earlier instead of redirecting onto a highway for half a mile.\" So it is not an intelligent algorithm.This unit is OK for approximations, but you really need a secondary map or phone GPS to clarify things. Kinda makes this device useless and I shoulda bought a routing APP for my Android instead, and downloaded the map for my whole state for offline security. If I ever buy a standalone GPS again, I'll look at the Rand McNally ones, as I think they understand mapping way better.Google Maps is still the best I've ever used, but I wanted something less connected, lower power usage, fully downloaded maps for low signal areas, etc.",

Most of the information is accurate but have passed through some areas where its flashing red no trucks and there are none? Also its slow to respond to detours as it wants to turn you around and send you down the road you're trying to avoid. The Garmin nuvi was better and quicker for that. However for the price I would recommend it.",
