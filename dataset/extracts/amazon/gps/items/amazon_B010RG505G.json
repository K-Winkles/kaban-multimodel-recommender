Good news that I had an old cord from the Garmin this purchase was replacing and that did work to register and update the device. Also, I needed to get a micro SD card to allow the refurbished Nuvi to hold more than one set of regional maps.If you are planning a far drive, Say from Florida to Yellowstone, or my last years vacation from Alabama, US to Newfoundland, CA you Will need to augment the onboard data capacity. But as I said I used one of these last year with the added micro sd card and aside from getting a bit glitchy within 2 kilometers of the farthest northeastern coast of Newfoundland I liked it well enough to replace it when the first got broken.One additional advantage was to adjust the display to show our speed / progress in kilometers on entering Canada. If you have a US automobile it can be a royal pain to use the itty bitty markings on your speedometer to determine if you are exceeding the Canadian speed limits.",
