It was easy to setup, had various pricing plans, well made. and most importantly extremely accurate.I own several high-end Garmin GPS devices and the LandAirSea 54 rivals the Garmin precision.I bought this device to track my luggage on an upcoming international flight. I tested it with my car and am well pleased.The 4G connectivity picked up the device location from the first level of a 5 story parking garage at my workplace. Furthermore, it transmitted the location to 8 floors up in my office building.Normally GPS is not reliable in this scenario but the device succeeded.I don't trust my Samsung Smart Tag with only Bluetooth to show me where my luggage is. I do think I will get a good result on the future trip.The app is also simple yet well designed.5 Stars",

Seems accurate within 40ft (12m) or less. RED icon in photos is the devices reported location. BLUE is actual location.Battery: last a couple days on the 180sec/3min update plan. It will drain much faster if you choose more frequent updates.Size: fits easily in a small zipper pouch inside my luggage where my laundry bag is stored.After 1 disastrous trip where I was told to come pick up my bag 5 different times only to drive 45 mins, show up and it not be there. 2 airlines lost the same bag that trip. I could have saved myself so much time and money if I had this at the time.",

They finally stopped working.I purchased a different land and Sea tracker a few months ago and it didn\u2019t work, I now believe it was because of the location in the vehicle. in the past couple ofweeks I have tried two different companies trackers. The first was so complicated and I never could get it to actually work with a map and tracker location. I positioned it in different areas of vehicle and still no results. The company did offer help but I thought this is too complicated and more for a fleetoperation. Second companies platform wanted you to sign up and only identified one fee for service. with no explanation of how many seconds of update for that fee. Attempted to contact for information and continuously dumped into online chat. It was clearly not person, but computer, because it could not answer that simple question. I want to say that Sea Land Air have a very simple sign up platform you know exactly whatupdate times you\u2019re paying for. simple instructions for how to operate and i could see immediately the map and my vehicle. I love this group and have talked directly to their representatives multiple times in the past. now I\u2019m hoping that it works as well as it did. I will let you know. i\u2019m giving the device four stars for now because I realize it\u2019s premature but I\u2019m so happy that it functions so easily.",

                "reviewText": "I like the product very much. Seems very well-built, and in terms of tracking, highly accurate and reports reliably (even indoors). Have yet to test long-term since I just activated the device today.The main concern was a gotcha - that the subscription costs, I've just realized, were _PER DEVICE_ , which was not my initial understanding. (Where descriptions may say \"unlimited use\" isn't equal to \"unlimited number of devices\".)This was quite the gotcha, as I purchased six of these devices. Even with a 2-year discount, the cost was still significant!Concessions were made once I had spoken with Billing. I'm not paying over $500 per device anymore, but the total bill is still nowhere close to the amount I originally thought I'd be paying.So, in summary - I've no doubt this device and system will be great to track my valuables. And, I will expect that, considering the premium I'm paying for the service.Huge silver lining though --- US company. As a YouTube reviewer said - accountability in this time and age is worth the serious consideration. That, alone is worth that premium. And, with the friendly concessions, and the company standing by their product and service - I feel it's a win-win for everyone!",
