It is very accurate as it tells me right where the car is parked in a large parking lot. The monthly subscription fee is very affordable. It also tells you how the vehicle is being driven and will alert you to common problems if there are any. I'm very glad I purchased this. It's been working great for a year now. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep track of where a care is going and how it is being driven for whatever reason (like I said the driver doesn't even know it's there in my case ;).",

This allows me to talk with my teen about different habits i notice and help them drive safer. I have had no issues at all with the unit. It connects easy, updates frequently, and provides detailed driving records. It\u2019s a small price for peace of mind when you have a new driver. I highly recommend for anyone about to put their child on the road.",

                "reviewText": "This is a phenomenal device and the price is fantastic. This device is extremely versatile \u2014 you can use it to track your mileage on your business vehicle like I do but you can also use it to monitor your teenager to ensure they\u2019re driving safely as so many others have said or even stalk a significant other (not what I would do but for you voyeurs out there.....).Anyway, I\u2019ll address some of the negative reviews. Some people don\u2019t love that it doesn\u2019t work it the car is off. If you\u2019re worried about theft or the car being towed than this product probably isn\u2019t for you. Otherwise this isn\u2019t an issue for most folks. Where the car starts and stops will be your starting and ending locations MOST of the time. Otherwise you need another product that has to be charged or configured in some other way.My only criticism of this product is that while it has a small footprint it is noticeable if you\u2019re looking for it. I had several friends get in my car and they didn\u2019t spot it but it was glaringly obvious to me. Again \u2014 I\u2019m using it for mileage tracking, not detective work.Finally, the functionality. It really is beautiful\u2014 this thing is crazy accurate, sends a signal to the app the second the car is turned on and off. Speed limit, mileage reporting and other indicators (hard breaking) are all spot on. The app is beautiful and works perfectly. It runs off of ATT 3G signal which is plenty fast for this \u2014 15 second refresh rate is fantastic.Setup was a breeze and the price and monthly fee is dirt cheap in comparison to other products out there.I would encourage anyone who has any of the needs I\u2019ve listed to get this device without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "Greetings. I bought this for a very particular reason: to be able to prove my whereabouts in the event I am wrongly accused of a crime.This device is wonderful. It provides very detailed routes traced out in Google Earth or Google Maps. Tap anywhere on the route and you will see the exact time you where at that spot. You can place yourself anywhere at any time, with precision. You do not need to have your smartphone with you. The device communicates with cell towers, not with your smartphone via Bluetooth, so if you forget your phone at home or at the office it is not a problem. You can view your routes later, once you regain possession of your phone. The app shows your start and stop times as well as beginning mileage and ending mileage. Since it plugs into your ODB port it records mileage and even knows when you are low on fuel and warns you.You can program geofencing for your children to alert you when they either leave or arrive at a location you input into the software. You can set alerts for hard braking and hard acceleration to see if your kids are \"hot dogging\" your car and causing premature wear.There is just so much functionality to this thing because it is being fed real-time information from the ODB port. And the monthly subscription fee is very reasonable. I looked into devices like this years ago and the devices themselves and monthly subscription plans were too expensive. Bouncie has crushed these barriers to entry. The average person can now afford this technology.The only thing this device cannot or should not be used for is real-time driving navigation assistance. There is about a 15-second delay in your actual position and position on the map, so if you're looking for an intersection you will drive through it (miss it) because of the delay. Not a problem. Either use a dedicated car GPS from Garmin, Magellan, TomTom, etc, or use Waze or Google Maps as your real-time driving app.Another cool feature is that since it shows your route end location, you can locate your car in the event you forgot where you parked. I had to do this yesterday. Went to a mall and forgot where I parked. Pulled out my smartphone and pulled up the Bouncie app. It indicated on the map where my car was parked. This thing is so accurate it always shows me my EXACT PARKING SPOT +1 left or right, meaning if you pinch zoom while in the satellite map, it will show you the exact parking spot you are in or might err one parking spot to the right or one parking spot to the left. It's absolutely incredible.The unit does not fit tightly into my ODB port and I was afraid it would back itself out and fall to the floor after a few days, so I used a cable tie to wrap around the Bouncie unit and its support mount/bracket. It is now fully secure and will not back out. Recommend at least an 18\" cable tie, if it is too long just snip off the excess with scissors.Be well. I hope you found this review useful.",

You have to drive around to get it started. Since there are no instructions, I am reciting what my experience was. I like that you can see it on multiple devices and only cost 8 dollars a month. App is easy to use. Make sure you have the app downloaded before you plug in the device. I had to remove it install again so the app could see it. Giving it 4 stars only because it doesn't come with any instructions. Pricey but i think it's worth it...so far. Will update if anything changes.",

                "reviewText": "I know of more expensive brands that work very well but I was searching for a more economical solution, and honestly, I tried out several other brands (mostly from Amazon) in this price range before settling on this one. I have 8 of these running so far in my fleet.The Bouncie website and app are very simple and straightforward forward and it offers useful information such as fuel level and reads your codes for you. I found the GPS is quite accurate and reliable in comparison to most brands in this price range. This is congruent with brands that are 3x the price. The other ones I tried in this price range or cheaper often track fewer things or have less accurate GPS.The phone app feels a bit more restrictive than the website but I think most are that way.For me, the biggest downside is that don't carry OBDII accessories such as extensions, splitters, or hookups for vehicles/units that don't have OBII. However, they were able to recommend other brands that will work with their units so I was able to order those now as well.The other downside is they don't offer a warranty, at least from what I see, so durability is in question.",

In this case I have purchased 2 of these GPS trackers for both my kids cars and they have been incredibly helpful to have and gives me peace of mind. My kids sometimes drive home late from work, or take longer trips, and this way I know they reach there destination safely, or if there is a problem like a flat tire, I know where they can be located. They are very accurate and work fine 99% of the time. Super easy to install just plug and play, and then track using their app. Its easy to switch between the 2 cars in the app. Its also great for keeping tabs on when servicing is due as it tracks mileage. Yes it costs a few dollars per month but for me its a cheap way for peace of mind!! and Kudos to the app makers as many apps are terrible but this one is pretty good.",

We did have some trouble activating the device (it was registered to another account, so possibly a return?) but the customer service chat representative fixed the problem in a few minutes. No other problems and the OBD device was super simple to install.The monthly price, information it provides and ease of the platform are all excellent. We only wish it would provide more text/call options for those late night alerts.We linked Bouncie to IFTTT as well to help visually alerts us by blinking our lights in case we don\u2019t have our phones nearby by - but a call or text would be helpful. We would also love to see Apple Watch integration.Overall, it does everything it say - and it does it excellently and intuitively.Highly recommend for a bunch of reasons and for a bunch of applications - but especially if you\u2019re concerned about a loved one getting lost or confused while driving.",
